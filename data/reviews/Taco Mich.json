{"text":"Pros: Great tasting authentic Mexican food. It says they have an A+ rating on the door. Reasonable price for a meal. They're open 24 hours; so good late night spot.  Cons: Every time I go the tables are dirty. The floors are dirty. The place isn't very big inside. I try to carry out as much as I can. The bathrooms are located outside on the side of the building and they're dirty as well. The staff is hit or miss. They can either have you wait awhile or get your order quickly.  Overall if they cleaned up the place it would have received 5 stars."}
{"text":"I DO NOT RECOMMEND COMING HERE !!! They will take 10-15 mins just to take your order if not longer . Then you have to wait another 20 mins for your food to be ready ( I only ordered a carne asada burrito and a quesadilla and I waited almost 20 mins ) not to mention the horrible service the lady had an attitude and did not mention I would be charged .50 cents for using my debit card which is nothing really I just think it is something they should tell us before processing the card. All in all the food was some what decent not the best but not the worst . That's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars but I would recommend you go anywhere else before here unless you have time to waste waiting for your food !"}
{"text":"Transvestite working here.  VERY disturbing. Have fun waiting 15 minutes for cold food. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Phenomenal tacos. Cheap. Stopped in on the way to good Sam and ordered the 5 taco plate for $5.49. Carne asada. Street tacos the way they should be. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Taco Mich (originally Taco Mex) for about 5yrs & it's been the same taste. Now that a new owner has taken over , the tacos are smaller &more expensive. I'm glad that everything still has the same taste, though. I just newly introduced my friend to this place &he loves it!"}
{"text":"Not bad if you eat in. Stay away from the drive-thru. If you are looking at the menu on the wall, the cashier will yell thru the intercom to hurry up and pull forward. Once you give your money, they tell you to park and wait up to TEN MINUTES for them to f-up your order and bring it to you. This has happened more than once and they get mad if you point it out to them. Taco Bell is next door. Better off going there if you want drive-thru."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the carne de asada tacos and the agua de horchata, they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Taco Mich when I spend $40 on your food , you should at least give me a serving that doesn't look like it half eaten and thrown across the room,."}
{"text":"WORST MEXICAN FOOD IN PHX.. I ordered the hard shell chicken tacos and they were horrible!!! The shells were store baught  and tasted nasty!!! On top of that the chicken was cold and pre cooked and in tiny cubes .. The Worst tacos ever!! I Also  ordered a carne asada torta and that was horrible as well .. The bread was cold, hard and old.. The meat was cold dry and very little of it,, had I opened my containers of food I would have asked for my money back on the spot.. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyway!!! Still the worst"}
{"text":"I can only talk about the tacos because that's all I've ordered but they're pretty damn good, My only complaint is that they're too small, but for being $1 or $.75 cents each on Wednesdays - I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. Took the order almost 30 minutes to come out. The employees wer very ghetto and claimed oranges wer lemons. Behind the kitchen there was like 8 people and none got things done. Employees wer drinking soda and placing it on the prep tables and wer not wearing gloves. This is pathetic. One of my favorite places had gone Down. Never coming again."}
{"text":"This place has the most Disgusting-est food in all Pheonix  Yuck. The quality is bad the meat is cold it lacks flavor the eat in is filled with cockroaches and the drive through takes about one hour so they can come and give you a goat turd size food, just plain HORRIBLE, never ever eat here"}
{"text":"Moved from LA to AZ about 4 months ago and I have to say this is as close as it gets to LA tacos. Absolutely delicious. Its very inexpensive. Definitely my new favorite place"}
{"text":"Food is good! But customer service wise it really sucks! I'll probably come back, advise Tuesday come before 8pm that way the tacos are .75 cents lol, we also order some carne asada fries and they were good and different from some other places, like I said g Food is great they just need to improve in their customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"I live 2 blocks away from Taco Mich.. rolled in one night wasted and ate head and tongue tacos and was in LOVE!!! Came back a couple days later to see if it was cause I was drunk... NOPE!! Taco Mich is the real deal people!! Get over the fact its kinda shady lookin and try it out.. its Central Phoenix afterall but I love my hood!!! I get 4 tacos (doesnt even matter what kind) and a Horchata for 6.66 almost everyday haha.. one thing to add that I think enhances it all is the lime, jalapeno, and carrot bar.. make sure every bite contains these ingredients and I promise you your journey in finding the ultimate/best street taco will be complete."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite mexican food joint in the valley. Anything on the menu us great. The price is perfect and the service is good. It does take forever to get your food but thats because they cook everything fresh. All of us GCU students poor in their at 2-3 in the morning after drinking and they take care of us. Authentic mexican food and authentic store. They are open 24 hours which is perfect for us college kids across the street. I recommend this place for drunk food or late night cravings."}
{"text":"Taco Mich is my favorite local mexican food around GCU. This location is the main location while the one on camelback is one of the sister locations, the aunt owns that one. Taco Tuesday's are on Wednesday here just FYI. The food is great I can't say it enough. Drunk, late night munchies, or a quick dinner -this place can do the job. The price is right which makes it better. It's all fresh food too. I'lll never go to a 'bertos again."}
{"text":"First time here, came on a Wednesday to taste their $0.75 tacos. And I was very satisfied.  I'm from L.A., where they have the best street tacos on earth. It's been a mission to find some good authentic tasting tacos out here in Phoenix, but I do have to say this place is pretty darn close. I got asada & al pastor tacos. Yummy.  Their horchata is Freaken delicious too. Oh, and that salsa they give you for the tacos Mmm.... Warning it's not for the weak, has a nice kick to it."}
{"text":"Great price and great .75 tacos!  The actual establishment itself is scary.  There was a lot of homeless and drunks sitting outside on the patio.  The outside was filthy.  Inside it was clean a d the service was ok.  They should not let people ask for money right outside their door."}
{"text":"5 stars - It's as good as it gets in Phoenix.  If you're looking for something fancy, this is not the place.  However if you are looking for amazing pastor tacos look no further.  Also ask for the verde sauce.   These are authentic street tacos with only cilantro and onions.  Horchata hits the spot every time.  Beers are $1-3.  Can't beat the prices.   4 stars - The carne asada and carnitas are pretty decent.  carne is a little dry but nothing that a little extra red salsa can't fix.   1 star - Word of advice, skip the tongue."}
{"text":"Great street tacos with just the right amount of heat. It's not in the best part of town, so be aware of homeless people coming in and out begging. If it wasn't for the great and inexpensive tacos, I would avoid this place because of the homeless people."}
{"text":"I don't know why it has only sour reviews. Maybe they've made some changes? Me and hubby recently went and we loved the food. Tacos are pretty good in comparison to what u normally get out here. I'm not giving then 5 stars because the dining was filthy. It is a really hole in the wall, about to fall apart kind of place but I would recommend it. Plus, a drive thru..that's cool."}
{"text":"Great Mexican tacos for a great price! We bought 12 tacos for under $15 excellent place highly recommend."}
{"text":"normally the food here isn't too bad, but the customer service flat-out stinks if you're a white guy. I have noticed that is true with most of the taco Mich's in town. They love to overcharge people. Make sure you look at your receipt, they will rip you up quick and then all the sudden they don't understand why you're mad. If you don't mind being overcharged, this is not a bad place."}
{"text":"If this were based solely on the food it would receive a 4 star rating. They treat white people and mexican people a world apart. First they charge 7.00 for a meat and cheese burrito. Nearly double that of a regular burrito. Asked for onions and cilantro with was omitted and when I asked for it they opened the flash of the burrito and threw some in on 1 side somehow dumping the rest of the contents. Very poor service.  Couldn't help but notice the empty tip jar. Tacos were above average, but for the service you get here you can make out better elsewhere"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy. I ordered the carne asada tacos and carne asada sopes. The meat was a good quality and not too much fat. They have a lot of space but not to many tables. They need to invest in some tables and chairs. There is a jukebox so you can play music while you eat. They also have a few small tvs if you want to watch any soccer games. I suggest you take cash because there is a fee for debit use. The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Really good tacos, not enough meat. The place is a little small and not super clean but can't expect much with cheap prices"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst \"Mexican\" food I've ever tasted. Maybe it's an acquired taste. This place is horrible. My carne asada nachos were exactly the same as the nachos you get at the movies or 7-11. How they attract customers is beyond me. Obviously Phoenix is in dire need of authentic Mexican food. The place is a dump. I'll never return."}
{"text":"The best Horchata and Jamaica anywhere! Great price for the food, everything is really good!   Their tacos are delicious, but their sopes are my new favorite! food and a drink are 5/5! Customer service for a fast food place is about as expected."}
{"text":"My sister went to get some food and they gave her the wrong order she had to comeback and they mess the order again so my sister called the place to tell em about it and the cashier Norma gave super rude attitude to her thru the phone so I decided to go to this place for an explanation about the food and this person attitude, but there is not manager at the time so this lady ask me what solution I want for this problem so I said I want to have my money back but she just gave me a rude attitude again and lies about what happened and didn't fix the problem, I don't know how this place don't care about the costumer service but definitively not coming back there and food that day was bad when usually they were better"}
{"text":"I ordered Carne Asada Burrito, 1 Taco de Asada, 1 Taco de Cabeza, 1 Taco de Lengua, 1 Taco de Pastor. The tacos are small and the burrito was more tortilla than anything. The meat  tasted like it has been reheated, not fresh. The tacos had more union than cilantro. I would not recommend this place to anyone, and I will not be returning. This place needs to have fresh prepared food, if they did this they would probably have potential."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Got our food to go and loved the Tacos and rated the burrito that my husband got - very good, fresh and authentic. Definitely going back to try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"Their posted opening times do not seem to be accurate this is the second time I stoped by only to find locked doors! Which is too bad because I like the food... and will not likely wast my time at this location again."}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos are great! The salsa too hot for me lol so I get on side!  Employees are friendly and knowledgable. Usually get the tacos cuz they're cheap and delicious but they're small so I end up spending the same as I would on a dinner plate."}
{"text":"Service is BEYOND shitty, I've had my order messed up on more than one occasion (fortunately it's always been stuff I'll eat). That said, the Al Pastor tacos are ON POINT! The carne asada isn't bad either, and that is my sole reason for returning to this place. The other location(s) don't seem to suffer from the lousy customer service though."}
{"text":"To bad I have to give any stars.  Should had known when speaker was broken.  The all day menudo for Saturday and Sunday was not served in the evening.   Strike two.  I ordered my food and 27 minutes later finally got my three tacos de lengua.  I called three times and I asked where my food was, as I was asked to park at the neighboring business.  I opened them up and they were the most tasteless tacos ever.  The tortillas tasted like they had been warmed up in water. I went home so I could doctor them up.  Will never go back here and horrible experience."}
{"text":"I like this place... A bit grimy but the women who work there are wonderful and the food is amazing. Tip them, bring cash.    My typical order consists of: 4 Chorizo tacos 4 Al Pastor tacos 1 Carnitas Quesadilla  1 red Mexican drink 1 horchata   Try it... You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Man how can you hate on a .85 cent taco! Pretty damn good may I add, I got two tacos Al pastor and one carne asada very solid taco. Oh yea get the Pina drink."}
{"text":"Dirty- cashier handed me a towel to clean off our table. I thought she was joking.  Rude- I paid for a drink and when I asked for the drink I paid for the cashier looks at me like I grew two heads  Food- filibertors has them beat need I say more?"}
{"text":"Only been here once so far so my review is only based on the tacos. I came here for the 75¢ tacos. I ordered 4 carne asada tacos. They are quite small but definitely have a lot of flavor. And whatever chipotle sauce they put on top was pretty hot. I like it hot but some people may not. I also got Horchata and it was pretty good. Overall, not a bad hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint."}
{"text":"Food is great.. Their green and red sauce are super hot beware but overall good mexican food. will be back again!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most authentic and flavorful on this side of town. Fresh from the kitchen; this is not a 'sitting under a lamp' type place' The ingredients are quality and you finish a meal content not overstuffed only to be hungry in 2 hours. Definitely worth the wait for the food to come."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for a few months and I cannon they enough of there tacos. Best tacos ever for the best price ever. The best day to go is on Wednesday since they have 75 cent tacos. There very fast with bringing your food out. And just great people all around. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Clearly, they don't want patronage from white people.  I was constantly referred to as \"gringo guy.\"  They got what they wanted; I'll never go back.  I wish there was a minus zero star for the rating. Racists! All I wanted was food."}
{"text":"The tacos al pastor here are delicious! Prices are reasonable as we paid 86 cents a taco. Our total for one Budweiser, one Mexican Coca Cola, and 8 tacos al pastor came out to be about $13.   The location is easy to find as it is right on the corner of 16th street. The inside is not pleasingly pretty but hey they have tables and chairs.   There is a bathroom but I wouldn't use it. The line to order is right at the entrance and it's very small.   They don't have a variety of salsas. They do give you one flavor of salsa with your tacos but they don't have anymore.   If you want good tacos al pastor, come here."}
{"text":"There are so many taco shops in Arizona, both mom & pop shops, and chains, but Taco Mitch is by far,  the best little spot for authentic Mexican food. Whether its for breakfast , lunch, dinner, or that late night \"fix\", you wont be disappointed.  Bonus = .75 cent Taco Wednesdays! You may wait a few extra minutes for freshly prepared food, but well worth the wait! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place compared to the surrounding restaurants. Good customer service as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants  in Phoenix. I feel like I'm in Tijuana when I eat here. The beef tacos with EVERYTHING are delicious. They are small, so I order three.  Less expensive than most fast food joints and much better tasting. Two of us had lunch for $9."}
{"text":"75 cent Taco Wednesday! But, really i recommend going for their Tacos any day! Delicious Tacos!! I have also tried their bean burrito, which i found delicious also. We love to go and eat here!"}
{"text":"came here on a Wednesday for the .75 deal.. didn't realize I had paid full price until I saw my receipt.. apparently the deal ends at 8pm -__- Very hot inside. Placing an order and waiting is kinda hectic, people are on your back, no breathing space. Tacos are pretty tiny!!  Messed up on my order but they gladly fixed it. Was satisfied with the tacos de cabeza. might give this place another try, might not."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here because a lot of the local taco shops around here are amazing! I thought this one would be just as good. To start off it looks like a small fast food joint. Nothing crazy but it looks clean! The food looked good but that's about it. Its gross not edible and grosssss. The rice was rotten the avocado was older then me. Just a bad place over all dont waste your money. Sorry"}
{"text":"I came in because I was in the area getting my bike fixed and saw the 75cent Taco sign and realized it was Wednesday so I checked them out. Its not appealing to the eyes and the service is pretty terrible and the wait is long but the food was delicious and inexpensive. That's really all I cared about."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon, weather was perfect we sat out back flies were a little of a bother but what can you expect your outside.  We went for tacos and they were delicious! None of us had complaints on the food.  Michelada was also a big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix for almost a year now. I moved here from LA and became addicted to King Taco. For those of you who aren't familiar with LA and King Taco, it has THE BEST tacos and THE BEST salsas (omg so spicy!) and THE BEST horchata. I was so obsessed with this place that my coworkers eventually started calling me the Queen Taco. I used to come here frequently when I first moved into the area.  Taco Mich isn't nearly as good but it's still pretty freaking good. I don't have much of an opinion on their salsas because they're OK but their carne asada tacos are fantastic! Especially on Taco Wednesdays when they're only $0.75. Seriously can't be beat.  If you're looking for some affordable, delicious tacos in DTPHX, I recommend checking this place out.  There's parking in the back, but the lot is a little small."}
{"text":"$.75 tacos on Wednesday can't be beat.(but only till 8th). I had multiple types of meats and I gotta admit I will only go back for Pastor maybe Carne Asada. The pastor was very tasty. And man! Their salsa is hot!! But delicious!!! Had to order some extra to drench my tacos but if ur not into spicy food be careful. I only had their tacos so I can't speak for the other menu items. Their burritos looked pretty big and only $4.50 so I will say it's worth a try next time. Don't be scared of the area, and if you are you could order from the comfort of your car in the drive-thru. :-)"}
{"text":"Super authentic, super good. I came by at about 9:30 on a Sunday night and only had to wait behind one or two people to order, but as I was waiting for my number to be called the line grew all the way to the back line of the restaurant.   This is a paper plate type operation and I wouldn't have it any other way. If you spend more than $10, I am both really happy for you and honestly surprised. Most things are under $6 so you'd have order multiple items, but they are fairly portioned so I don't think that happens much. If it does though, kudos! I was pretty tempted to hop back in line myself and accept the overeating to try something else - it all looked so good!  There was a also what appeared to be a taco only cart outside. I'm assuming it was for those who wanted their tacos even quicker, but was a little confused because there was no sign or indication of its affiliation (or potential lack there of) with Taco Mich. However, there was a solid line down the sidewalk the whole time we were there for the cart, so whatever they were doing out there must have been working.   If you are visiting GCU or happen to be in the area, I recommend making a stop."}
{"text":"$2 for chips to eat inside rip off usually restaurants or tacos shops are free we came here on a Wednesday tacos are 85cents it was okay I liked the pastor and the cabesa \"head\" tacoswere my favorite \". the agua de horchata was too tooo!!.. sweet I needed 1 large cup of water to mix it in. Bathroom is just oh man .. they need a smaller trash or put it somewhere you can't even sit comfortably on the toilet if my 5 year old complains about the trash being to close then I don't fit ... I like the tacos to go but not to eat inside."}
{"text":"Stopped in after doing errands on the West side - traffic was horrendous so I decided to give Taco Mich a try. So happy that I did. I had dinner plans so I only planned on a little snack -- Their chicken and pork tacos were tasty. I will definitely return to try other items on the menu. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday? I think not, how about taco Wednesday these guys have the best taco specials on Wednesdays,  $. 75 tacos are you kidding.  Great small street tacos super tasty and you can order 6 of them with a medium orchata and only pay $7!"}
{"text":"Beef and pork tacos are amazing here. Just like in Mexico. Only tip would be to ask for extra salsa!"}
{"text":"i went on a tuesday arround 5:30pm. food is ok customer service was ok as well, the thing that i found horrible was the condition of the restaurant first off it was really hot they have a cooler operating for the whole restaurant. the ceiling had alot of stains and looked like it had mold and it was full of flyes and bugs!! i sat by a window and there was 2 beetles crawling on the window and the worst part that there was too many flyes there is a poster full of stuck flyes i kid you not full of flyes i bet it will still be there if you go!!! i immediately  was disgusted and could not even finish my tacos dont go there unless you want larva on your food!!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in all of arizona. Would have gave this place 5 stars on flavor alone. However customer service at the register is hurting. And no bathrooms. I doubt we will ever be returning for these 2 reasons alone."}
{"text":"This place is a really dirty. The people working very unfriendly and their tacos we're soaked in grease. I definitely won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time eating at Taco Mich tonight and I'm officially a fan! If you've never been, here are my tips for you: 1) Order one or two tacos more than you think you should/normally would. They are smaller than you'd expect! 2) There's a small charge to use your debit card (very small), so take cash in if you've got it. 3) Take a look at your order number as soon as they hand you the receipt and be prepared for them to call your number in Spanish when your order is up. 4) If you're with other people, split your orders up. The tacos will all come out together on one or two plates (or wrapped in foil if you get it to go) and there's not really an easy way to identify which is which, especially if you've ordered to go. 5) If you like spice, get some of the red chili spice that's beside the pick up counter! (You need to really, really like spice.) Overall a good experience - I don't know that I'll visit this location alone after dark, but the food was very good."}
{"text":"Sad night. Tonight 6/30 the cashier girl at 11:25 was all over the place. Kept going away from me. Had zero customer service skills. Started to order my food and she said we don't have chips. I left. Not coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"Great tacos and okay service. I love the Agua de pina. The tacos de lengua are not as good as tacototes. I would recommend going to mich on a Friday or Saturday when they do al pastor on front of the site.  They are yummy."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever forgot to give me my drink and over charged me at the same time salsa bar is ridiculous be ready to have salsa everywhere no salsa cups just plastic bags SMH and the staff has snotty faces like they hate their jobs"}
{"text":"I have been to more than one location for this chain, and this one has got to be the absolute worst tasting, dirties, and unprofessional staffed one of them all. The food tasted horrific, I understand it's a cheap buy but this is something someone would have to pay me to eat again. The staff was unprofessional and I was greeted with a warm \"what do you want\" by the girl at the register. The food was made within a reasonable amount of time and tasted like it was made with rotten meat scraped off the floor by a stray animal. The rice was undercooked the beans were burnt and parts of them were hard as rock, I have never seen a different location serve the beans refried but these beans definitely tasted nothin like beans. Over all the food, service, and hygiene of this place is horrid. I will never be back and I advise anyone to never purchase from this location."}
{"text":"Best place for street tacos and like the prices. Authentic and good value for your money."}
{"text":"Really delicious affordable Mexican in a convenient location! Servings on tacos are really small but super cheap! Salsa is spicy"}
{"text":"These tacos are by far my favorite in Phoenix. The tacos de al pastor are second to none. It's kind of in a sketch neighborhood but it's worth driving out here. The inside is really clean, the service is great. The men's bathroom was clean, but it did have a funky smell inside not of poop. The asada tacos were bomb as well and I had some carnitas and they were also fantastic ."}
{"text":"Top 5 of my favorite taco spots. The red sauce is close to king taco sauce. Really good. 24 hrs is def a plus always come here"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a negative 5 stars. Horrible customer service. I think they are racist and only appreciate Mexican/white customers. They never get my order correct and the list goes on. That is the honest truth F*** them and I will never return to this location  And the girl at the drive-through needs to fix her face she's always angry who would wanna come back after looking at that mug"}
{"text":"it more seems like youre just hating on the place i've been going to this place for years its always been the same cheap great tasting food. you can go to the other places where your food can be so expensive and nasty its not even authentic mexican food it americanized food. if you can actually compare it to the taco stands in mexico thats because its real if it doesnt even look like that then its not authentic you can say whatever about this place but for me its the best real mexican food place other places are just imitations.."}
{"text":"What can I say this is my go-to feed the kids some goood Mexican food on a budget restaurant. It never disappoints. The carne asada is to die for. The window outside in the patio where you can get your late-night to go tacos is ever so convenient."}
{"text":"Que robadera son estas?! $1.25 por cada taco, $.50 cobro por transacción de tarjeta de crédito, $.68 más si quiere horchata. $1.25 no es el valor indicado por el taco pequeño que le dan y eso que tampoco no dieron suficientes condimentos para dos personas. Si estos son los tacos de los adultos, que les darán a los niños. No vale la pena el precio ni el tiempo que gaste en ir."}
{"text":"seriously? so many of you expect everything perfect when it comes to things. its quite funny. Taco Mich's staff does in fact speak English! specially the one taking your order....its great quality food for the price..no really...I can eat about 6 tacos for 5 bucks and get full. both my husband and I are huge fans."}
{"text":"Tacos are very small. Not very flavorful or well seasoned. Not recommended. Horchata is good though."}
{"text":"Very disappointing  I hate giving a restaurant with positive reviews a bad rating so let's start this review off on a positive note.  The service at Taco Mich is quick and the staff is very accomdating, which is why I  feel terrible for saying their food is  bland and poorly presented.     Taco Mich food isn't so much bad as it is bland, and the presentation of their entrées are, I hate to say sloppy and unappetizing. Today my lunch companion and I ordered the taco dish combo and to be honest it just did not taste very good, and the food was lukewarm at best. The color of the beans, rice, and meats are all muted together somewhat like bad cafeteria food.  The tacos were topped with a  combination of cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes  but it all tasted greasy.   I'm not in a rush to visit Taco Mich anytime soon. I feel that  unpleasant flavors are worse than no flavor at all."}
{"text":"The rude service will keep me from returning. I don't understand why they are so rude here. I ordered some tacos for .75 on Wednesday. Halfway through my order the lady decided she didn't like me or something and changed the pricing, so I was charged 1.10 on the remainder of my tacos. They also gave me only one container of salsa for 6 tacos and the limes were extremely dry. I regret tipping them. This place is super hot inside too. Just go to Tacos Sahuaro, their tacos are slightly bigger, a lot better, the staff is extremely nice so the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"Came here on a late Saturday night after 2am. Gave me the wrong order of enchiladas which were basically wet tacos. Customer service was terrible and everything I ordered was half-assed. Flautas de pollo and tacos de asada were dry and flavorless. Stick to the 16th location and avoid this one. Food is unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"My wife pass by this restaurant and bought me a carne asada burrito and brought it to my job. When I saw the side of this burrito I was surprised how small it was.  It was also missing a lot of things that other restaurants make it standard, so I got only one salsa, no guacamole, no cucumbers slices, no radish slices, or limes, no chiles toreados, unions, or pico de gallo, you guys get the point. If you want extra salsa, they would sell t to you, so don't expect a salsa bar. Not happy, and no buying again from here."}
{"text":"The food is good for the price. A little more meat wouldn't hurt but I'm just being nitpicky. It's a pretty straight forward place. I love their carne asada fries for sure. Most of the food choice combos are all pretty good food portions. The place is definitely not too bad."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. The tacos are amazing and at a great price. Amazing atmosphere and friendly staff   I ordered two of every taco and none disappointed. The spicy sauce that comes with the tacos packs heat. Be careful. I also ordered a beer which was for a dollar during happy hour. Very authentic feel. If I lived here this would be my spot.   Apparently on Wednesday's there are .85 tacos.."}
{"text":"Just grabbed some tacos for a late night snack to-go. Tacos were delicious!  My only gripes were the slow service and a mistake fulfilling my order-I received a chorizo taco instead of a carne asada.   $.75 Tacos on Wednesdays 8am-8pm only! Otherwise they are $1.10 each. Awesome value."}
{"text":"La comida esta buena. Pero la cajera si no tiene ganas de trabajar que mejor no se presente a trabajar."}
{"text":"Looking for good cheap tacos... Tacos Mich on Wednesday is the place to be!  .85 can't beat that. Just a tortilla and meat with onions and cilantro if you want. The red salsa they give you is the kind that you have to keep eating even though your nose is runny. That's the good kind!!   Not a fancy place but the line is out the door on Wednesday's.  I don't only go for Wednesday special, whenever we want simple yummy street tacos Tacos Mich is our place."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!  Hole in the wall. Don't expect a five star place, it's not that.  The food and the prices are GREAT!  7 street taco's and a couple of beers for what, twelve bucks.  And soooooooooo delicious.   My girlfriend and I go frequently. Birria de Chivo (goat) taco's con todos. Carne asada. Horchata. Everything I've had is delicious.  No complaints."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are from California and have found it a bit difficult to find a Mexican restaurant with good food and good pricing. We were so excited when we found this place. The food is so good and on Wednesday's tacos are .75 cents! Although parking can be a pain because they can get pretty busy I Definitely recommend this place! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Taco Mich and it did not impress me. The location itself has a good atmosphere but that alone doesn't make up for the food. I had 3 tacos (pork,chicken and asada) the flavor was not bad but not really good, I wouldn't eat here again. The service was good tho and they people working there were nice."}
{"text":"Ordered the 5 tacos & Medium Drink deal..(I was hungry and ate 3before I took this photo.. ) Lol. Got it with pollo asada. Asked for Xtra cilantro and onion.. That didn't happen. Tacos are really mini and when I got home tacos looked thrown together wrapped in foil. Not the greatest presentation.  Prepared Very sloppy. Their salsa is not all that, but it is spicy! I liked that they gave me lemon without having to ask! Tacos tastes okay.. If I was drunk they would have probably been amazing. For the pice, I could have gotten more from a Fili B's! Their five taco combo can be made in to ten with all the chicken they serve. If it's the only taco shop around.. Sure. Otherwise I think I'd rather get tacos from a FILI B's!  Judging by other pictures for this spot.. Looks more appealing to eat there rather than taking it to go!"}
{"text":"The food has great flavor the spice cooked in the lengua is really good. They have a clean eating area, outside eating. The service in great . They have TV's an music it's a fresh temperature with fresh air circulation. They have fresh juices an even a full ice cream bar. A great find on a Blvd of many Taco restaurants."}
{"text":"This restaurant is as authentic as Taco Bell. the super fries have nacho cheese sauce on them, from a can. the quality of the asada is gross, like ground beef but with more fat. there was a huge lack of guacamole, which really would have been nice with how spicy the nacho cheese sauce was.   it also doesn't help that the employees are VERY rude taking our order and were later making fun of us in Spanish thinking we wouldn't know.   there are so many better restaurants within walking distance of this one. do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Thought they had a taco Tuesday deal, totally on Wednesday though. No big deal, got me out there. My buddy ordered a carnitas burrito that he couldn't stop talking about. I got a carne asada burrito and taco, OMG was it hot. Places can never make food hot enough for me, I actually felt like I was eating authentic mexican food today. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Had their tacos which were a great lunch at work and today I had their chicken chimi and that was also delicious!"}
{"text":"I was told it was a great place for tacos. Well unfortunately this place is disgusting! I found a hair in my asada taco and the lengua was not properly peeled. The cashier has no clue she literally dug her dirty nail in my taco looking for the hair and said \"no miro el pelo\" (I don't see the hair)then handed the taco back to me. There was a lady mopping with dirty smelly mop water while we were eating! It is very hot no AC only fansI do not recommend this awful place to anybody. There was a young man taking ready to eat meat in a garbage can to sell tacos outside.This place needs a health inspection!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos are great, but the customer service is lacking big time. I think they need to be trained that without the customers you all wouldn't have a job here."}
{"text":"So I've been eating tacos from this place for over 2 years. And I am absolutely addicted! I'll admit my very first experience here I was a little apprehensive. But I am so glad I tried it and I continue to come. I love the red spicy sauce. And the price is always well worth it. I do recommend always check your order if you get it to go. Sometimes I've ran into situations where there was a bit of miscommunication but they've always corrected it anytime I brought it up. Sometimes if you go late at night there is a bit of a long wait if you go through the drive through. But if you're like me you won't mind waiting for fresh food when there's 3 cars ahead of you."}
{"text":"I had a hard time giving them 3 stars, food is great, but the cashier was made of out of rock. I came into the restaurant with a smile and acting polite, my small talk (which is what they should be doing) was abruptly brought to a halt by the cold face the cashier had. She didn't smile at all, neither did she respond to my politeness. I've felt better at places that have automated cashiers."}
{"text":"Taking a trip down nostalgia lane with having lunch with my best guy. I initially started coming here for their taco Wednesday, from 1 job, then it became tradition. I get the tacos or the #5... but La Dieta is calling and I'm in trouble. So this is a great place, but for me, just once in a while! Lol. No reflection on them. I like taking my kid here bc the ambiance is reminiscent of Puerto Rico. Just a tad:)"}
{"text":"Every Wednesday, this place has some of the cheapest tacos in town (less than a buck!) And with their full bar you're sure to have a good time.  They have a large menu apart from their tacos, including rice and bean stuffed burritos of all sorts (and their rice is great). Their carne used to be the best in town, but the last few times it's been a bit too fatty for me. I love my carne to have a crunch to it (I know most people dont but I love it) so the fatty bits stand out a lot in their otherwise delicious food. Their carnitas can be a bit hit or miss as well, sometimes delicious and sometimes alarmingly squishy and unpleasant. Their pastor however is always tasty, though its a bit too spicy for my pallet my boyfriend loves it.  As far as flavor goes, this place is great however. Their red sauce is incredibly spicy (and sooo good) and their verde is great when you only want a twinge of heat. They have a salad bar to dress up your meal, and boy a touch of lime really makes that red sauce kick (immediately and when its saying farewell).  Parking can be a bit of a hassle on Friday and Saturday nights since there's a popular night club next door, business is also packed those nights with people prepping for the night. Even with a packed lobby however, its never taken longer than half an hour to get my order.   Most people order to go since the neighborhood isnt that great. And they do charge extra for using a card and when you order to go, all tacos will be piled on top of each other so beware.  All in all the Mich is a great place to bring a large group and kill some time on a week night. Grab a few drinks and a ton of tacos, play a game of pool and have a good time. Its also a great place to come after a few drinks at the bar when you want a giant burrito but fewer regrets than you'd have with a 'Bertos."}
{"text":"after ordering over the phone for our company for about 5 years i call & the female who answers refused to take my order unless i gave her my card number, even after i specified i would be paying cash.. after i told her that ive been ordering ther for about 5 yrs she hangs up, i attempted to call again to get her name but no answer....."}
{"text":"I have tried to eat at this restaurant 3 times. The first two times, I tried to use the drive-through. After waiting more than 15 minutes with the only progress in the line being people leaving before reaching the order window, I left. Both times, same experience. Today, I decided I would walk in. My first clue is the large sign by the order desk saying that it takes between 5 and 30 minutes to get your order out, and there are no refunds after you pay. I'm betting that's how they make money. Because, today, there were 3 couples in the restaurant, and I stood at the order desk for more than 5 minutes without anyone showing up. So I left. Maybe they have good food, I don't know. Good luck trying to get any."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Rude employees. Gave me the wrong order. Refused to remake the order. Gave my wife chicken tacos instead of beef. The store was not clean. Cook had gloves on and sneezed in his hands and continued to cook. Yuck. Good salsa though. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"They know how to season and grill the chicken to a good crisp on their super papas.   Evening people sometimes are rude but it's get busy so I get it. Morning are the best, very friendly and always smiling.  They'll take their time to point out the specials so you don't waste money."}
{"text":"They don't season their chicken, makes everything bland.    They also forget to debone the chicken sometimes.  It's not busy but I usually go here if there's nothing else I want."}
{"text":"Very good fresh tacos $1.10 each.Wish we were here on Wends. When they are .75 I had the chicken - a bit spicy, definitely had a \" kick \". Street taco size was perfect . Daughter. & Bf had carne asada, said it was \" good and fresh \" We ordered a horchata to go with perfect to cut some of the spice.Small place but staff was friendly & fast."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lengua/tongue platter here on Sunday 3/23 evening and the food was good, but we both had really-really bad food poisoning on the next day.  We had diarrhea and we were vomiting all day, it wasn't pleasant at all.   I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager/female and told her what happened. Her responded was flat, didn't say sorry at all.  Taco Mitch, you disappointed us."}
{"text":"The food is good. Im talking about the tacos and stuff the pizza is absolutely disgusting. It tastes like oven pizza qnd its greasy. So greasy you can literally see it. The pepperoni slides off the cheese. Will never buy pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Drive thru sucks got my order wrong and actually had to pull up to window due to Boone responding sir in  inside restaurant look cute the set up but really hit no ac just fans Tacos are really small need to Oder 4 to fill up"}
{"text":"Good place to get late night food especially after a few drinks. Service was good and the food was tasty. Cleanliness of the tables and chairs may be an issue to some, and late at night they may not have everything that's on the menu, which one of my friends ran into that issue. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast burritos.  Huge burritos with quality, good tasting ingredients for a good price.  Much better option than any of the chains around.    Others have commented that they don't speak English however the girl that rang me up spoke very good English and had no problem understanding my special request for my order.  Menu is in both Spanish and English.  There is a sign that says specifically to make sure you know what you are ordering as they wont give refunds.  I'm guessing that's because there are like 20 different types of meat, a lot of which I've never heard of.   This place has been on my list to try for their tacos so I will definitely be back to try them out."}
{"text":"Great little local find - simple, authentic Mexican food at crazy low prices!!  Tasty too - what else can one want?  :)"}
{"text":"I went for the first time yesterday for taco Wednesday for their 75 cent tacos and I will never go back there for 3 reasons  1.  We waited about an hr for 6 tacos. I understand they were busy and all, but they should have prepped better. It took about 10 minutes for each order to come out.  2. On top of that, I had explosive diarrhea later that evening, and seeing that it was the only thing I had eaten that day, I'm confident it was their tacos.   3. The cut of meat on their steak was absolute crap, and the meat was so chewy and fatty.  Terrible, overrated place. They have pretty good prices, that's the only good point about that place."}
{"text":"Great tacos but the sauce is what makes these tacos amazing. Refried beans were great too. Good prices."}
{"text":"These tacos are amazing, I order the street beef tacos with cheese, cilantro pinto de Gallo, and Mexican shredded cheese on top!! Defiantly will be coming back"}
{"text":"I love tacos ! There agua de piña is so good !! I never have personality gone in to sit and eat because I'm always eating taco mich on my lunch break . The owner  is very nice , muy amable! Totally recommend tacos de Asada and lengua!"}
{"text":"I've gone a couple times now and I really enjoy the tacos here! Definitely worth the price. Even though my orders are sometimes a bit messed up, (like they forgot to give me avocado or no cheese on beans for certain orders) I'd still say this is a place to go too. Just double check your food first! Also their red salsa is fire!"}
{"text":"The customer service was great and The employees are very knowledgeable of the large menu and it's offerings however the product quality was lacking. The meat did not taste fresh by any stretch of the imagination. The only salsa offered with the tacos was burn your mouth off hot!!! Therefore, I was left with no option other than chewing down dry tacos."}
{"text":"My fav spot for tacos. I always order to go and eat at home but honestly my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Beer, Pay by phone, and mini tacos. How can this be bad.  I walked in and found a nice authentic atmosphere and tacos are delicious! 5tacos and a beer for under 10 bucks. That's what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO. WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. Food was not even appetizing. Messed up on my order then said oh we have no eggs. They expect every single person walking in to speak Spanish. Rude did not want to even give a refund. Took about 30 minutes to just make my messed up breakfast burrito. I asked for management number and she goes here you go. Don't waste your time better places in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Great midnight munchies spot. The prices ares low, employees are friendly and the food is authentic.  It's next door to a club so is pretty poppin after the bars close. They also serve alcohol here!"}
{"text":"Tacos are good but the customer service is terrible! The ladies are so rude and have a bad attitude every single time ! The 2 stars are just for the tacos, nothing else."}
{"text":"I stopped by today to pick up a variety of breakfast burritos for my team at work in Scottsdale. The people at Taco Mich were super nice and very helpful. My team ate them up. Normally when we do a Friday breakfast, there is food left over. Today it was all gone. I had people asking where I bought them and if they were homemade etc. Thank you Taco Mich! I can't wait to stop by again."}
{"text":"I am amused by the hilariously unclassy poster/sign they have on the right side of the building advertising beer with some stripper chick. But Taco Mich has the tastiest little tacos I've ever put in my mouth. I always order two fried pork tacos and two marinated pork tacos. They're tiny but wonderful.   They speak Spanish. Really, I'm pretty much the only white guy, they call out order numbers in Spanish, I had to Google for a translation so I didn't stand there sputtering like an idiot gringo.   Lots of bottled beers in the  customer-accessible fridge. Broad menu selection, too, they have burritos, chimichangas, and more. I also order rice and beans on the side, which tastes plain but not bland and still very good and not cheap or crap quality. Rice is a little dry. EDIT: The rice isn't so dry anymore, maybe they saw the review. ;)  I also order horchata. Delicious, if over-sugared. EDIT: The horchata's not so over-sugared anymore, maybe they saw the review. ;)  This is one of my favorite taco joints! Mas por favor!"}
{"text":"Literally my least favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix their food is horrible flavorless but when you are up at 3 a.m. and are starving it is a good fix"}
{"text":"This place was pretty decent for the price. The tacos are a little bit bigger than a baby hand and you dont get much meat. Their meat is already precooked with onions.. so even if you ask for no onions you still get them. The ratio between onion and meat is what anyone would expect for the price. More onions than there is meat. But i will say they had a pretty good taste. If you enjoy spicy tacos, this is something worth a try. Would i come back? Eh, very unlikely. But to each their own."}
{"text":"The best advice I ever got about a Mexican restaurant is to always look for the hole-in-the-wall. Man, their food is delicious! The rice was amazing and so was the carne asada. I will be back to try something else soon! Cheap and yummy! :)"}
{"text":"Why does this place have good ratings?   The meat is low quality,  the service was super slow...  All in ll a bad experience.  I've had a lot better"}
{"text":"Stop telling me Taco Mich is good. It is very much the opposite of that, and here's why:   The quality of ingredients blows. My salsa has tasted watered down. The beans in my burrito have been dried out. They serve some of the greasiest meat ever. The 'super papas' have canned cheese sauce instead of actual cheese.   Like, literally the only thing this might be good for are cheap street tacos. And a modest beer selection you can enjoy on a late evening with your friends. I like the space itself, the prices are lovable, but I cannot stand the food. I've got like a dozen superior alternatives on deck."}
{"text":"Best carne asada in town!  Bro took us to lunch after the painstaking task of helping him move, ugh! We loved it! Fresh simple food! Only criticism..... use QuikTrips bathroom, don't use their.   Their tacos are way cheap, $1.10/ea normally and I think on Wednesdays they are like half priced. Very goof fresh ingredients.   Excited to try the other location close to my house."}
{"text":"Cheap appetite satisfying food w super cinnamonized Horchata is what I got. The salsa bar was emptied out when we got there at lunch.Their Birria tacos were tasty & meat was flavorful. If U like ur Horchata w lots of Cinnamon, this is the place 2 hit."}
{"text":"At this point I've only been to this place once, but it seemed, in the words of Yelp, A-OK.  Because it is very close to home, we might walk over again some afternoon when we don't want to cook and happen to have some extra cash.  Service was fine.  Simple order & pick-up model, so not much interaction.  The cashier was doing some other work back in the kitchen area and let us know to call when we were ready to order.  The menu is pretty extensive, with lots of different meat options for the various entrees.  Prices were fair and the food was all right.  Nothing stand out.  Really, just fast food.  Like Taco Bell, but Mexican (yes, Taco Bell is NOT Mexican food).  The horchata was OK, but the jamaica was delicious.  As a vegetarian, this wasn't my Mexican place.  There are some I have found with ample bean and veggie based dishes, and then some fish to supplement (if you swing that way).  Taco Mich didn't really provide that, but, then again, it's usually \"trendy\" places that amp up the  veggies options.  And Taco Mich isn't trendy, but solely functional.  It's convenient and cheap, so if that's what you're looking for, give it a try."}
{"text":"These tripa tacos are the absolute best tripa tacos I have ever had. I had gotten used to the nasty tripa tacos I used to get in Texas. They were so bad, fried within an inch of their lives and hard as shoe leather. Taco mich has some amazing tripa tacos, and their carne asada tacos are pretty darn good too. Be careful with the red salsa, it is easy too put too much on your tacos and ruin them by making them inedible. The horchata is very tasty as well, none of that overwhelming coconut flavor like at some places."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and waited about 20 minutes for 3 tacos. But when I got home I was pleasantly surprised. Especially since I only payed $1.10 per taco on a Sunday. And wherever you go that the locals wait for the food,  you know it's going to be good. So check it out if you don't want to try the taco trucks in the neighborhood. The place would probably not pass health inspection, but a good taco place never will."}
{"text":"This is probably the most I've ever waited in drive-through, I think I'm going on an hour. The drive-through speaker doesn't even answer so I pull up to the window and the first thing lady told me is she sorry they're busy. But what I see is one lady in the kitchen another one at the front counter eating and one lady managing drive-through and the front counter. I could drive off like 2 other people have done, but I figure I might as well try the food since I waited this long. What I see is serious understaff!!! And it's not even a weekend... it's Wednesday for crying out loud!"}
{"text":"Ah, yeah. I'm taking Taco Mich's yelp virginity.  I've been to several upscale \"Mexican\" places here in Phoenix with varying degrees of success. Taco Guild and Urban Taco, etc. They have their niche, but this aside from sharing the word \"Taco\" they really have about as much in common with Taco Mich as a 3rd generation, college educated Mexican-American who's lost his Spanish and a guy who's still paying off his coyote by picking up odd jobs at Home Depot.  If that metaphor didn't do it for you, I'll state it more clearly. This is not a poncy re-purposed warehouse trying to peddle an overpriced meal on style alone. This is legit. the real deal. La verga verga. Un verdadero, autenico, hole-in-the-wall, Mexican restaurant. The type of place Sheriff Joe probably hates just because.  This is your tongue-and-tripe-tacos-with-a-big-Styrofoam-cup-of-Horchata-for-$7 type restaurant. Or if your not partial to the idea of eating tongue (because honesty, there's no way you don't like the flavor), they also have the traditional beef, chicken, or fish. Don't like tacos? Get a torta. Or a flauta. Or one of myriad other authentic dishes that aren't served for some reason at your chips-and-salsa type restaurants.  And if you've never tried a torta or a flauta, or tongue or tripe, shame on you!  Live a little, try something new! Be adventurous!  The tacos are nicely flavored with cilantro and onions, and the salsa packs a punch and has great flavor. Add the meat and you're in taco heaven. Have I mentioned price? You can get five tacos here for the price of one at Taco Guild, and it'll taste better. The horchata is satisfying, and their agua de melon is novel and fun. I've don't see melon juice often at most hole-in-the-wall Mexican spots (maybe it's an AZ thing?), but I'm glad I tried it. Sweet, but full of chunks of melon, almost like smoothie. My only gripe is that they didn't have salsas in the salsa cart, you had to ask for salsa at the counter. A minor inconvenience all considering. The wife reported that her enchiladas were excellent as well, so you really can't go wrong here.  My advice: next time you get a hankering for cheap Mexican, avoid Yuckyberto's and take a trip to Taco Mich.  Great for: those who seek the Holy Grail of authentic taco Not great for: Sheriff Joe"}
{"text":"Taco Mich 35th & Glendale Cost: $1 Service: 2 of 5, Slow, and had to order twice in Spanish. Presentation: 3 of 5 Taste 2 of 5, no flavor and it was cold. Why would it be cold if you took forever just to make two tacos?"}
{"text":"I love this places tacos. But I only go on taco Wednesday when they are cheap. I hate waiting in lines, wish they had a better system to feed me tacos faster.  By far my favorite tacos. Plus since they are under $1, I can eat like 10 on the cheap. El pastor = 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"OMG new fav!!!! So glad to have found such a gem. Showed up on a Wed for $0.75 tacos. Bomb!!!!!! Out of the way for me but worth heading by!!!"}
{"text":"I was staying at a nearby hotel when I heard a guest and some employees talking about this place, so I decided to give it a try.  I love street tacos and was told that the ones at this place were supposed to be excellent.  Yes...they are!    When I walked in, I felt like I was in Mexico so I knew the food had to be good.  The cashier asked if I wanted my tacos with hot sauce, but I asked for it on the side because I had heard from the hotel employees that it was HOT!.  After I got my order, I'm glad I ordered it on the side.   Next time I'm back in Phoenix, I'm heading to this place again."}
{"text":"Stopped here after work, pretty good tacos but I came too early for happy hour I'll be back though. My margarita wasn't all that but I'll give em another shot.... ok ******update. I checked my account and I noticed that I was charged twice....I called back to try and speak with someone and explained to the senorita what was going on and she hung up on me. Sooooo with that being said I will not be going back to that Taco mich location"}
{"text":"They raised their prices, again. They charge you extra for everything including debit card! And get this. They can't afford to repair the intercom that's been broken for quite awhile. Food was disgusting. Thank God for the A grade other wise I would be totally scared of the cleanliness inside."}
{"text":"It was Midnight on a Saturday and I was famished.  Mexican sounded satisfying, so I hit up Taco Mich.    I've driven by the $.75 Taco sign countless times but tonight I pulled the trigger.  Parking was actually difficult at midnight because there was a packed bar next door.  No drive thru, so you will need to go inside.  The Tacos are $1.10 each which is a great deal, on Wednesdays they are $.75 each.  I went with the Al Pastor tacos and they were  very good.  Small street style, but so delicious.  Next time and every time I come back, I will only order the tacos.  I also ordered the Super Nachos..  No bueno, for how authentic the tacos were, I was surprised these were lack luster.  The nacho cheese whiz and the ball park style yellow circular tortilla chips just didn't do it for me.  If it wasn't for the let down on the Nachos i'd be giving this place a solid 5 stars just based on the tacos alone."}
{"text":"So far I've had 4 types of tacos and they've all been great. It's the small ones but they're only $1.10 everyday except Wednesday they're $.75. Yes sir! Taco Wednesday has a new place in my heart.   They make Pizza and Wings too. There's music playing and at least 4 TV's. there's a foosball table and some video arcade games in the back. They have Ice Cream and Frutas Natural as well as the basic drinks. I'd recommend trying these and leaving an honest review. I'm not going to try the pizza or wings this time, but I will be back so maybe next time."}
{"text":"The appearance is not the best but their tacos are good. They are a bit small but for 75¢ on Wednesdays they're good. Also, the burritos, tasty. I usually don't get my burritos from anywhere but Federico's, but I will be coming here to get my burritos! The agua de pina is also good! Overall what I have tried has been good and they have a drive thru, which is even better when I don't feel like getting off!"}
{"text":"My dad always picks up breakfast burritos here and they are just amazing. I just get the cravings for them at times. If you go here try them and you will really like them."}
{"text":"Customer service is not the gratest, but the food is good. The carne azada burritos are the best, nothing compared to the other mexican food places with the drive through (the \"bertos\")the meat is actually grilled not boiled. Not to mention the Taco Tuesdays  with .75 cent tacos!the Aguas frescas are also good, they are natural, not the machine kind!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before the atmosphere seems nice and my previous dinning experience was ok however I can not say the same this time around. They have a Salsa Bar with no salsa, now I don't know if the cashier (Maria L. Per my receipt) didn't like me or if it's just their policy I ask for 2 hot sauces and she only gave me one. I ordered 5 tacos and a large drink and it only came with one hot sauce costing me a little over $9.00 and they couldn't hand over an extra hot sauce? She pointed at her sign, I advised her of my dislike and I would never dine here again because if it. I'm sure she does not care, I wanted to return the food but since I had already paid for it I decided to stay classy and eat it while I Yelped. Hope your future clients have a better experience."}
{"text":"Disappointed with service and food!! They charge extra for guacamole.  Very small tacos. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"75 cent Taco Wednesday has enticed me for years. But I always associate Tuesday with tacos, not Wednesday, so I never got around to trying the glory of a 75 cent taco until today.   First, I recommend coming after 1pm for lunch, or you will be waiting a long time for cheap tacos if today is any indicator of a typical Wednesday at high noon at Taco Mich. The line was put the door. Only two or three people were working in the kitchen, so it took over 45 minutes to fill my 6 taco order.   The choices are limited to asada, pastor, lengue, cabeza, and bruche.  I am not a fan of tongue, head meat, or stomach, so I limited my order to asada and pastor.    The tacos were fabulous.  The sauce was hot. Where else can you get 6 tacos for 4.78 with tax out the door?"}
{"text":"OK I really wanted to like this place as my friend recommended it, and I'm normally not one to leave yelp reviews but I was extremely disappointed. After ordering I got home and realized they forgot one of my tacos that I paid for, but because I work in a restaurant I understand things happen so I wasn't super bothered. However, after trying everything, nothing had any flavor. It was like eating sand paper. Then in the middle of eating my burrito I had to pull a giant hair out of my mouth....."}
{"text":"Tacos are cheap!! The salsa is flavorful and spicy. The carne asada tends to be dry from sitting but that's what you get for the price. Perfect for taco Tuesday with a limited budget(.85 cents for a taco)."}
{"text":"Great place. I usually come on Wednesdays. The street tacos are .75 from 8a-8p. Can't go wrong with that. I've never ordered anything else from the menu."}
{"text":"This is a hole-in-the-wall.  It's a Taco Wagon taken out of the wagon and put into a restaurant that looks like it came straight off the side of a highway in Mexico.  I love it.  The food is authentic, there's always a soccer game on the TV, and I'm usually the only person speaking English in the restaurant.  I always get the enchiladas, because, well, I really like enchiladas.  I can't vouch for anything else on the menu (I'm sure it's good), but the enchiladas are the bomb.  Do yourself a favor and eat at Taco Mich instead of at the popular chain across the street.  Your intestines will thank you."}
{"text":"Authentic street tacos I recommend the carne asada beware of the salsa! Delicious but very very hot! Great prices!"}
{"text":"GOOD:  Their tacos are small but on Tuesday you can get them for 75 cents--the chopped steak are good, the chicken not so good.  They are open late. BAD.  I tried the chicken enchilada dinner---total crap!   Small chunks of dried chicken, no cheese, stale wrap...even prison food tastes better.  $6?  I put it outside--the dogs wouldn't eat it----cats seemed to like it.... The tables are always dirty--I do take out only..... +++ The ONLY reason to go here is for taco Tuesday....ONLY!!!!  There is a better place up the road on 27th & Bethany"}
