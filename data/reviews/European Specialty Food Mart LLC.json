{"text":"Absolutely wonderful imported deli & grocery products, especially eastern European meats, cheese & artisan pastries.  Bought a party tray for my husbands birthday & it was the first tray finished!  Owner Sebastian Filote is more than happy to suggest ideas. Prices are very fair & all the food is so yummy & fresh.  Highly suggest a visit."}
{"text":"Bought two types of smokies. Both were full of fat unable to eat. Took them back and they refused to replace or make right.. Don't buy smokies.... so far other food has been acceptable. Don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm always hunting for new places to buy different foods and beer from across the globe. Quite an impressive beer selection and a wide variety of countries are represented. Definitely worth making a stop and crossing off a few different beers off of your passport."}
