{"text":"Another great social enterprise cafe concept open at the Burton Barr (downtown) library through SARRC. Great sandwiches and service, all the while supporting adults with autism. The Italian and chicken and avocado sandwiches are my faves. Recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Just said goodbye to Starbucks and all the others! There's a hidden treasure right inside the entrance of the Burton Barr Library. Beneficial Beans! The best double-shot of espresso--hands down. Excellent fresh sandwiches and baked goods. A beautiful place to read and study with friends. Feels good knowing all purchases help Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center as well as the local economy."}
{"text":"Great coffee, fabulous food & amazing staff!  Even better that 100% of proceeds benefit adults with autism.  One more service that SARRC is providing to the Phoenix community."}
{"text":"This is my favorite downtown cafe. Not only do they offer great coffee drinks, teas, smoothies, soups, salads and sandwiches but 100% of the proceeds benefit adults with autism. They are a training cafe so adults with autism work there as interns for several weeks to lean skills that will help them get a job in the community. You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"We had a large staff meeting at the Burton Barr library today and had the beneficial beans cafe cater. The food was great, the presentation was amazing, and they had everything ready to go so I didn't have to worry about anything. Try the chocolate chip cookies, brownies, and iced teas!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and delicious food in a cool location! Love that the proceeds go to SARRC, a non-profit charity that helps thousands of families every year with treatments, education and counseling for children, and adults with autism.  I highly recommend the grilled chicken with avocado sandwich and their cold brew coffee is on point! I also purchased a bag of whole bean coffee which I brew at home and is very good.  Looking forward to making this one of my regular coffee stops!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Great coffee, great food (had a sandwich and soup) and just a very nice vibe. Great place to meet up with someone for a meeting or a meal downtown."}
