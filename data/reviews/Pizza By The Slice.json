{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. Pizza made and sold by a nice old couple. The pepperoni slice and a drink deal is amazingly cheap at $3.55 (yes, tax included) and there's a chill window-facing area to sit and contemplate the passers-by going about their routines."}
{"text":"worst place on fremont street this place is a joke dont try food there i cant belive the place exist"}
{"text":"By The Slice is one of the best pizza places I been to.  It is a small place nicely tucked away in the plaza.  I order here at least once a month for lunch with my co-workers.  They always have killer deals such as 2 medium speciality pizza for $16.99 - Their specialy pizzas are amazing as they have around 5-6 toppings on it. Southwest chicken and Meat combo are my fave.  If you just want to pick your own toppings there is a 2 Medium pizza 6 toppings combined from $14.99.  Ex-Large Margherita or 4 cheese pizza for $9.99.  They surpising also have amazing fried chicken almost like KFC.  I actually like it more than KFC and it is cheaper as well.  10 huge Chicken pieces and medium wedges for only $12.99.  Only thing bad is the plaza parking is horrible as it shared with Wendy's, starbucks,Kelsey and Mr. Greek.  Can't wait to order from them this Friday."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizza slices to go as opposed to eating inside the restaurant. The menu for getting a slice on the spot is limited but the pizza is decent. It is not the best pizza out there , but you get humongous slices at an affordable price."}
{"text":"$19 for 2 slices and a drink.. I get it, it's Vegas.. But having such prime realty on Fremont Street, I expected a decent slice. I was wrong. This has to be the absolute worst pizza I've ever had. The crust was soggy. I can't stress that enough. It was as if you cook something on broil and the top gets crisp but the bottom never gets cooked through or as if you microwaved a day olds pizza. Maybe they should stick to hot dogs. I ended up throwing it away."}
{"text":"Went at 11am. My slice was thrown in the oven for like 90secs and served like warm. I'm not even sure it was safe to eat type of warm, but I've eaten cold pizza before so I went for it. The salad I got was good. Asked for water to drink and they only offered bottle water for a price. Service was meh. I'd go back if I was drunk and needed some filler food."}
{"text":"Do you know anyone that drives 30 minutes just to pick up pizza? I'm that person.  I used to go to university about a stone throw away from By The Slice, and I fell in love with it ever since I had my first bite of no-cheese grilled vegetable pizza. It's odd but magical.   Since then I've tried almost every type of gourmet slice in the menu. My recommendations are definitely the no-cheese grilled vegetable, Mexican and Californian. The prices are fantastic for both the pizza and pop. For about $14 you can get two med pizzas worth of pure taste-bud indulgence.   The establishment is wedged in with several other restaurants and parking can be tricky during lunch. There is also space for about 15 people to sit and eat, but don't expect it to be peaceful.   Just enjoy it while it's hot, and thank me later."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here not long ago. The pizza was undercooked and soggy. The potato wedges were soggy and super oily. It tasted as though the oil hadn't been changed in quite some time. When we called to voice our concerns the manager working told us that he was \"disappointed in us for not liking his food\". I found the comment very strange and off putting. He didn't offer us new pizza/wedges or any compensation, we will not be ordering from here anymore!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Good pasta too. I had delivery so I cannot comment on the environment or the service of this place. Br definitely will visit"}
{"text":"love this pizza place! handsdown BEST EVER.  i like thin pizza with lots of variety. i always ask for a little extra cooking so i can have crunch from the crust. gawd. love it here! chicken wings also amazing, comparable to popeyes or kfc.  highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"This area is saturated with pizza places...heck there's a Pizza Hut in the same plaza as this place, but if you want your money's worth you'd be wise to give this place a try! I was ordering some pies for a work lunch, and we had to feed about 15 people. Typically we spend about $75-80 on pizza for the gang, but I was able to get 2 x party pizzas (16 slices) and 1 x XL pizza with 3 toppings on each for $53 tax included.  Wow!! They had the pies ready on time despite being busy during the lunch rush, and even threw in 3 dipping sauces at no charge. Cheap pizza is great - but how was the taste, you ask? Pretty darn good! Overall, it was just 'pizza' - nothing wild or unique, but it was exactly what we wanted. They didn't skimp on toppings, crust was good, not bland, etc. They do have other food available (chicken fingers, wings, poutine, etc.) all at very reasonable prices. We have named this our new go-to pizza place for our office parties. Glad I decided to give them a shot - you should too!"}
{"text":"This is a must every time we come to Fremont.  Yes, it's just pizza by the slice, but that's why you are going.  We went twice on our last trip.  It's the perfect bite to go with your bud lite."}
{"text":"Solid 3.  ice deal if you are in the York Mills / Leslie area.  $5.50 for two moderate-sized slices (both cut into two) plus a drink.  Its not pizza I'd drive far to get.  Good amount of toppings, but I'm not a big fan of fluffy crust, sweet pizza sauce, and slightly undercooked pizza (I just made it sound worse than it was... I think...)"}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff are super friendly and the wings are the best. They're pizza has a thicker crust than I normally like but they have a wonderful assortment of toppings with a lot of unusual toppings (for takeout pizza) like avocado and roasted corn."}
{"text":"No outside food allowed!!! Half my group got different food opps!!!!!! Chill cheese dog pretty standard but nice and warm. Pizza was standard also. Crust not fully cooked.   Cashier had no personality, said \"what do you want?\" Great customer goes a longgggggg wayyyy! None found here, EXCEPT for one employee that i encountered. Gentlemen, did not get his name was so polite and even came over to my table to let me know that i had free refill.   He even came a second time to ask if wanted more soda. I must have appeared thirsty. Great service by him.  Might give them a second shot only if my group wants too come here again."}
