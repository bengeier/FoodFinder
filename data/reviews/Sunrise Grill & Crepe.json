{"text":"This is our regular weekend breakfast joint. A good breakfast place for eggs, pancakes, French toast etc. Wait staff needs a few reminders and this is not the place to go for a high-end brunch or customization. Just a casual \"joint\" to grab a bite, have a coffee (free refills) and read the weekend paper."}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service experiences I have had. Living on Roncy, I have been several times before (apparently I'm not a regular though--lol see below). The food has been good.  Not amazing, but good with good portions. Last Victoria Day Monday, I went with my family of 5 plus my mother for brunch. We did not have a reservation, and we were prepared to be shut out. But to our surprise, the host advised a wait of 15-20 minutes for a table for 6.  My wife and kids did some window shopping and I waited and chatted with my mom.  15 minutes turned to 25, but I assume that is par for the course and understand this is an estimate. We were asked a couple times by other servers about what we were waiting for. We were the only ones waiting and there were plenty of open tables of 2 and 4, but they did not offer to push 2 together, but again, I understand they want to keep their set up. After 30 minutes a woman, who appeared to be a manager or owner, came out and advised us that it would be another 30-40 minutes for a table of 6.    I was flabbergasted. I explained what we had been advised and that we had already been waiting 30 minutes. She apologized and said the person who had originally spoken to us made a mistake. She offered to put us in 2 back-to-back booths, but that wasn't going to work for us because we were there for a family brunch not just to eat. I suggested mildly that they could just push tables together (which would not have created any blockages). And her response to me (when no one else in 30 minutes had been waiting for a table), was that her \"regulars\" expect to be able to have those tables. What!!!!  I live in the area and had been there several times. What am I?  Chopped liver?  I was speechless at her unwillingness to address the \"mistake\" they had made and to try to seat us as soon as possible. It seemed like she just wanted us to leave. So we did. Wow.    I haven't really written a review like this before but I feel compelled. I was embarrassed in front of my family and I could not even relate to them the exchange in a way that seemed real.  Should I have made a scene?  It's just not my style. But I will certainly be relaying this tale to everyone in the 'hood.     We ended up going to The Westerly, which I had not yet been to, two doors down. And I'm glad. We had great food (better than Sunrise) and infinitely better service. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Okay, I loved this place! Just moved to the area, had some friends in town, so we walked over to Roncey on Sunday for brunch.  We lucked out!  The hardest part is figuring out what to order, and all of us struggled.  In the end, each of us ordered something different and each of us walked out of there with a smile on our face.  I had the Spinach crepe with feta, which was delicious & came with a \"mound\" of freshly sliced fruit on the side.  My bf had a fritata with italian sausage, which was a huge plate of food, and my other 2 friends had the waffle (w/cream, also came w/fruit) and huevos rancheros (spelling?).  Thumbs up all around. Outside of the entrees, we ordered coffee & bacon and I have to say they do not nickel & dime you on the sides, which was nice.  Heads up on the coffee -- Ask for the Supreme b/c though the regular coffee is ok, this other version they had can only be described as an emotional experience...and I'm not even a coffee drinker. If I had to raise a concern about something it might be that there are a lot of tables in there & while they're pretty decently spaced out, I imagine it could get loud.  If you're looking for quiet, go at an off peak time or maybe ask to be in the room way in the back. We ended up sitting there & it was perfect. Overall, great place, go check it out because there is something for everyone.  I'll see you there, b/c I'm definitely going back..."}
{"text":"Food great! (4 stars - sometimes 5) Service great!  Management and seating policy...idiotic...We will not be going back.  Even though this event happened last spring, we are writing to express our deep disappointment, as every time we drive by or think about Sunrise, or are looking for a restaurant for our weekly brunch, we remind ourselves that we should post this review.  We were regulars at the restaurant, until one day when 3 of us were waiting for a table and we were told that we could not be seated at a table for 4, as we were only a group of 3 people.    Despite the fact that at least 3 tables for 4 (or multiple tables of 2) were clearly visible in the front of the restaurant, and there were no other patrons in line, we were informed that we would be seated somewhere in the back when a table for 3 became available (in approx.. 20 minutes).  The waitress was visibly uncomfortable when we asked her to check in with management to see if we could have one of the vacant tables, but she asked anyway and was clearly told it was not possible. We felt sorry for her. It was the last time we ever set foot in the restaurant.  The desire to \"hold out for a few more dollars\" has cost Sunrise our business as well as the business of our family, friends, neighbours and colleagues, who we have all informed of the unfriendly and unreasonable policies."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. I go about once a week with friends.  A few things... the food is good, you get what you pay for, it's fairly greasy... so it's really good on a saturday morning after a late friday... but during the week... they have so many options, it's great.  However, the server with a smile...well in the year i've been going there, the same blonde girl that serves us has cracked a smile once (i think). i even tried giving a 40% tip a few times thinking she was having a bad morning, but no... just grumpy people who make me feel like they hate their job, hate the environment etc.... so be it.  i still go because i like the variety and they are open early. BUT... these guys need new ventilation... i always leave having to go home and change before meetings because I absolutely stink like a deep fryer."}
{"text":"Nice little Brunch spot. Service is fairly slow but didn't feel negligent, who is in a rush on Saturday morning?"}
{"text":"This is now my go-to place for brunch, having been several times and not being disappointed!  The Strawberry Delight has NEVER let me down. Even bringing a toddler/preschooler was doable. Once service was a little slow but not crazy slow. Yummy!"}
{"text":"3rd day in a row for breakfast - fruit pancakes n coffee. I'm new to the area and am delighted that this gem is in my neighborhood"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Typical diner, but with a much broader food selection. My favourite, Amaretto Sour French Toast, deliciously satisfying, covered with almonds and Swiss cheese, served with fresh fruit, yummy."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sunrise Grill & Crepe fairly regularly for breakfast over the past couple years. It's a nice little breakfast spot with a small patio on Roncesvalles near High Park Ave.   I have experienced this place vastly improve over the years. Where it used to be kind-of so-so and not the first choice on my list, it's now one my favourite local spots. Everything from the homefries to the coffee to even the napkins has improved at this place.   The service is friendly and timely and the atmosphere is rather mellow with wooden benches and tables. There is an open concept kitchen in the centre of the restaurant where the cooks are professional and hard at work. Usually I just have the 'eggs and bacon' breakfast but this time I felt adventurous and tried the spinach crepe with swiss cheese and walnuts. It came with a huge mound of fresh fruit. The meal was delicious! I ordered some of their homestyle potatoes on the side and they were perfectly spiced and savory. I like that they are not deepfried. They have great espresso and do cappuccinos and lattes as well.   I'm looking forward to sitting on their patio for many more breakfasts in this nice weather."}
{"text":"This is one of the places my partner and I take my parents to when they're in town - a place that isn't too adventurous but isn't a greasy spoon. Today I had the spinach crepe with swiss cheese, fried onions and walnuts, which was accompanied by their interpretation of a 'mound' of fruit: two slices of pineapple, a sliced strawberry, a slice of kiwi, two orange slices and maybe ten red grapes (The Beet's mound is bigger and looks like higher quality fruit). The crepe itself was quite tasty but very thin and I was still hungry for more.  Service can be hit or miss; today we had three different servers during our meal and one of them became a little annoyed when my mom asked for maple syrup, which didn't actually get to the table until she was almost two-thirds finished her french toast.  In short: not spectacular, but consistently gets the job done."}
{"text":"Got the huevos rancheros. It was appalling. Basically u get an undercooked egg on a stale tortilla, a pile of unflavoured, canned beans and 3 slices of rotting avocado (like a hard spongey pumpkin). Oh I think you might get a small amount of salsa too, and a bunch of raw onions sprinkled around the plate. The service wasn't great either, not once were we checked up on to ask how our meal was, or if we wanted a second cup of coffee.  Maybe it was an off day for them, like the cook didn't show up or they were overwhelmed with something, who knows, but I will not go back for a second try."}
{"text":"After trying a few other breakfast spots in the area, Sunrise has now taken its place at the tippy-top of my list. Who knew simple good quality was such a rare commodity? Thankfully, Sunrise uses quality ingredients, good cooking technique, reasonable prices, while offering a simple atmosphere... And, really, that's all that I want."}
{"text":"Horrible and disrespectful service.  When I asked what \"Grand Marnier sauce\" was on the french toast, the waitress asked the chef to explain, he looked at me and said, \"She can't have it.\" Assuming I was underage, which I am not, why would it be on the menu as a sauce if you are going to deny customers of it? If I had not asked what it was, I would have been served it regardless.  Deciding to stay despite this behavior from the chef, when I then asked what \"English cream\" was, the waitress again had no idea, the chef very disrespectfully and loudly, took the entire can of English cream and slammed it on the counter, turned away from my table of friends and did not say a word.  I have never experienced this type of service in my life. We had to ask for water, and then were never given refills. After asking for the bills, we eventually had to go up to the counter and basically do it ourselves because they were ignoring us.  Do NOT recommend this place in the slightest."}
{"text":"Good service. Small-ish portions. I got the huevos rancheros and left the place hungry. I almost never finish my restaurant meals. The regular breakfasts had lots of fresh fruit which is a bonus. Won't go back. Nothing wowed me. Coffee was pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and great value but service is horrible now. No top ups on coffee and servers who completely ignore you."}
{"text":"Neighborhood diner charm that doesn't disappoint. We had the bacon and avocado omelette and eggs blackstone. Both served with a generous portion of fresh strawberries, banana an pineapple.  Great place to enjoy brunch and enjoy the day in Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"The food at this place is really really good. It's fresh and tasty, all that I'm looking for. The staff is really friendly. I recommand this place any time..."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Toronto. Owner is super nice and service is really good.  Food is really fresh and delicious. I guess I tried everything on the menu. If you don't want to long line up and have a walk at High Park after breakfast, you must visit this place."}
{"text":"Good place. Service is a bit crazy. Some were complaining of waiting twenty minutes for an omelette, others got their order in less than five. Don't take the table by the cash, they'll knock stuff onto your table, reach over you like you weren't there, etc. Otherwise very good. Solid portions. I was even offered take out coffee after my meal at no cost if I wanted!"}
{"text":"I love brunch. And then some. There are few other simple pleasures in life than waking up in the early afternoon, after a night of youthful folly and much wine consumption, safe in the knowledge that the current headache you're rocking will soon be a thing of the past, thanks to the healing powers of a soupbowl full of coffee and that midday saviour known as brunch.   Some people are all about the sweet at brunch, opting for french toast with fruit, caramelized pecans and that sort of thing, which while delicious I'm sure, has never tickled my fancy. I'm a total egg person, whether it takes the form of an omelette, eggs benny (hold the peameal) eggs florentine or croque madame (sans ham). I do like a good scrambled egg but it's one of those things that I can pretty easily throw together at home and therefore has less appeal.  Visiting this cute Roncesvalles breakfast haunt, I was pretty stoked to check out their omelette selection, and to Sunrise Grill's credit, they were indeed plentiful. Portebello mushrooms, smoked salmon and spinach were all well represented but I opted for the Avocado omelette, because, well, it's an avocado. To round out the meal, I decided on whole wheat toast and potatoes.   The service was passable but not excellent - our waitress seemed pretty stressed and even showed a little sass when we were asking for our bill. It was moderately busy, sure, but it's Sunday afternoon and you're a brunch place - that's the main idea.  When our food arrived, this giant plate was handed to me - fyi,the portions sizes are beyond generous if that's your thing - and my omelette looked more like a frittata than it should have. The Swiss cheese that one would expect to be cooked into the egg was sitting on top of one corner of the omelette, in no man's land, looking patently ridiculous and flimsy. A slice of Swiss cheese ON TOP of the omelette? Not for this girl. The avocadoes within were tasty, sure, but I like my omelettes fluffy and maintaining the golden-yellow eggy colour, not cooked to a deep sandy brown. As far as taste goes, it was just okay - not inedible but not memorable either and a lot greasier than I would have liked. The potatoes/home fries were again, passable, not seasoned with any sort of distinctive flavour or ingenuity.   The atmosphere was relaxed and inviting and they do have a small outdoor patio area but I can't really imagine why I'd visit this place again when I know that much better omelettes await elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"This place has a lot to learn. Very disappointing with today's service.   1. When someone doesn't eat meat they should allow substitution or give discount. 2. Stop using spray bottles to clean tables I surely don't want that in my food.  3. A side of French toast should not cost additional $2.00 for one slice.   I would never go there again. There are just too many great place in roncy."}
{"text":"Went there as a group and it was super packed. Big menu with lots of interesting combinations to choose from.  I had an amaretto french toast which was quite good and came with a lot of fruit. Others at my table had a delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. There was also an avocado omelet which was deemed 'okay'.  The service was just okay, but I would definitely go again just for that french toast!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience, serving the worst huevos rancheros we had ever tried. Unmelted cheese, beans from the can, and unwarmed tortilla; leaving an utterly uninspired and tasteless plate! Take your business elsewhere, as we will next time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My friend and I had had coffee at the Abbott(KIng & Spencer, another great coffee place) and we were looking to have something breakfasty or brunchy. Eggs came to mind. We thought, hmm, let's walk up Roncesvalles and we did. We were getting tired and I was about to call a cab to get to College Street when we found this amazing place. Incredible omelettes (in this case, Kielbasa for me and  goat cheese for her) and the rest of their menu looked very yummy as well! Great choice for people living nearby but worth crossing the city for as well! Great service too, overall a winner!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. I very rarely give bad reviews, but honestly...I tried it 3 times. I'm honestly not sure why I went back.  The first 2 times the food wasn't good and my family and I felt a little queasy afterwards. The third time I found a long black hair in my food and when I told the server she said it couldn't have been anyone in the kitchen (I have blond hair). I sent it back and didn't want another. They still charged me for the salad I'd already eaten on the plate! I would highly recommend you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We went there about a week ago when they had a breakfast omelette with apricots.  It was disgusting!  The apricots were soooo sour they were inedible!  When I mentioned this to the server, she did not even reply.  Then, we realized that she could not understand what I was saying, or pretended she could not.  We thought back and realized English was a second or third language for her.  Either way, the bill was over $30.00 for 2 breakfast items - not cheap to begin with.  The quality of food is very poor. It was not a happy experience.  We won't be back.  The one star is for the open window/deck setting on a lovely summer day."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service, generous portions, and prepared right. A great breakfast in a cool neighbourhood. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I keep trying this restaurant hoping it will be better than last time but no such luck. Food is good, lots of variety, but there are a few things that make me crazy in there....  The coffee is undrinkable, the milk & cream servers are terrible. (go, you'll see what I mean), and the waitresses don't seem to have their act together (another reviewer summed it up, too much 1/2 the time and ignoring you the other half)  Go for the food, avoid it for the service..."}
{"text":"Do you want a good tasty breakfast and a decent cup of tea or coffee? That's what they offer. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm happy to recognize, recommend and frequent a good solid player like the sunrise grill. Servers are nice but unevenly skilled. It affects you less if you don't go during the rush."}
{"text":"This place is good. There is always a line up during the week end but it usually go fast. The amaretto french tost at absolutely amazing. The other options on the menu are maybe a little less good compare to the amaretto french toast at my taste. They give a lot of fruit on the plate and i really like this aspect of that place. They are not cheap with what they will put on the plate.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had an excellent breakfast here today! Started with superb organic roast coffee, served hot & quickly, which impressed me. My main dish was the Amaretto French toast (Swiss cheese melted between slices of French toast, coated under toasted sliced almonds), topped with real maple syrup. Yum! Surrounding this was a \"mountain of fresh fruit\" (as promised in the menu), and there was lots! Grapes, strawberries, banana slices, 2 slices of pineapple, and a thin wedge of watermelon (not my fave, but some may appreciate). All this delivered with little wait, and my coffee was promptly refilled throughout. Maybe complaints about service were for weekend brunches, but I have none! Friendly and attentive! Great food! Thanks!"}
{"text":"DE-LISH! I am salivating just at the thought of their incredible breakfast menu! Why can't it be Saturday morning??!!!    Sunrise Grill is the quintessential brunch diner in lovely Roncesvalles Village. It's a quaint little place, perfect for a lazy weekend roll-outta-bed brunch. Their menu will please just about anyone. Omlettes for some, pancakes for another, fruit cups if you like, and wonderful, incredibly delicious French toast for ME! Yes, I have a thing for French toast (see: my love letter to Victory Cafe in earlier reviews).   The crowd is friendly and everyone is there to enjoy the great food and good prices. The food takes a while sometimes, but it is very much worth the wait. Not just a breakfast place, Sunrise also serves sandwiches, burgers, and the like and is a definite MUST if you are in the Roncesvalles area. The grilled-cheese is AWESOME.   Sunrise is open Monday-Sunday 7am-6 pm"}
{"text":"We moved back to Toronto in October, and this place had quickly become a regular breakfast spot for us. The service had always been mediocre, but we loved the food and it was close to home. But our service on our last visit was so poor I really can't see us returning."}
{"text":"When I was attempting to explain the awesomeness of this place to my Bf it went something like \" it's a total breakfast experience, it's the only thing you look forward to on a Monday morning\". Although my work week does not start on a Monday there is a sadness to losing the weekend that leaves you feeling blue.  Sunrise Grill has the cure, a cute atmosphere with lots of vintage ads on their walls and if you take one of the booths you can see the cook preparing your food. Then you get excited when you see he is making your order. They have one of the best breakfast menus I've ever seen. It's the kind of breakfast I'd invest time in to make myself if I've been good. Amazing French toast, pancakes, crepes they even have poached eggs and huevos rancheros. When they say mounts of fruit they really mean it, and you don't just get two slices of old orange, you get a whole lot of different array of fruits all fresh!! It's a little out of my way but it's a great location and the service is just right."}
{"text":"So, I've been here before over the years and the food is solid.  Service started slower for a drink offer, but whomever she was by the time meals came and we were paying was super sweet. I'll keep coming back for the great breakfasts, the burger, and the load of fresh fruit. One critique for the eggs Blackstone: more bacon, more sundried tomato... Otherwise delightful"}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch. German pancakes are delicious! Light breakfast now with two eggs and a half plate of fruit is fantastic. Lattes are also yummy. Brie and avocado omelet needs a bit of a kick. Staff are always friendly and service is fast. Best part - no lineup and no having to wait an hour for your first meal of the day."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with one person.  Sat down and was ignored for approximately 20 minutes.  Finally, a server came by and asked what we wanted.  We asked for water, our drinks, and our meals.  Service was slow and quality of food wasn't worth the wait.  They don't offer substitutions on any sides, so you have to order an extra order, which was annoying. Once we finished our meals, we sat for half an hour before finally getting up and asking for our bill.  The ambiance was fine for brunch, though cheapened by the servers' lack of attention. 100% will not be returning or recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"Honestly I should have read the reviews on yelp before walking in but I was too hungry and this was the easiest choice. Ordered the eggs and sausages and wife ordered the yogurt with fruit. Eggs were fine but sausages not that great, fruit was a little old or not as fresh as you'd like to have. Bottom line average at best and maybe not worth it considering so many good places are around there."}
{"text":"An above average breakfast place - a great place for business meetings on weekdays.  During the weekend it can be a bit crazy and uncomfortable because tables are close together and people are sitting on top of each other and the door...  Love the fresh fruit and they have great coffee if you order their \"turbo charged\" variety..."}
{"text":"I think Roncy has more restaurants per square km then any other neighbourhood and a great selection to choose from- which also hinders the decision making process as you humm and Haa over the choices.  This is a good little spot. Service was interesting  - I was feeling ignored than overly attended to, then ignored again. The food was great - the menu made me feel less like a piglet as I found the 3 egg brunch choices hard to settle on and the ONE egg selection was just not enough. Apparently, people who come here, don't eat 2 eggs- which was fine by me. I particularly enjoyed that you have a choice of getting salad or mounds of fresh fruit with your food- which was better than fries or salad in my mind.  The mound of fruit weren't stellar, which gave me the impression that the cheap fruit market in Roncy were not at par to the cheap fruit markets in the Annex, which sold delicious fruits ONLY. However, only the tropical fruits flopped and the  melons and berries were fantastical.  All in all, good spot - I loved the seasoned home fries -- since the last few places didn't believe in seasoning. Great location too, by the the time you're done, you're so full that you need the walk to Film buff for dessert."}
{"text":"Nice size portions. Strawberry delight was just ok. Not much flavor. Bacon and avocado Omelette was nice. Had them add spinach and mushrooms. Hubby and I split the French toast and omelette and added farmers sausage. Outdoor patio small, but nice for people watching. Lovely neighborhood. Waiter was very friendly and accommodating. Gave us tips on where to go in the city."}
{"text":"Do any of you ever eat out alone?    I find there's a bit of a stigma about eating alone.  Antisocial weirdo?  Loser?  Smelly guy?  Or just someone who wants a quiet breakfast and isn't afraid of his own company?  My wife wasn't feeling well this Sunday morning, so she stayed home while I went out for a breakfast to Sunrise Grill.  I know, I know.  I'm a devil.  But I brought her home something to eat.  In this case, I really just felt like having some eggs and espresso, and didn't need or want a companion.  I took a good book with me, and sometimes that's all you need.  Sometimes....  Anyone who has read my other reviews knows I'm having issues with the profusion of wasps swarming around almost every patio I sit on.  They smell fear and are attracted to anything edible.  So I've started opting to sit inside by default.  Damn you CUPE!  I snagged a table with a buffer zone on each side.  If only it would buffer out the noise!  I can read almost anywhere.  Not always well.  Not always productively.  I find in front of the television is actually the best place.  Otherwise in the bath, or on the subway during a long trip.  I don't often read in restaurants.  Especially at busy yuppie restaurants  for Sunday brunch.  Bad plan.  At the next table were two couples in their early thirties.  Two loud couples each with their own restless infant children.    Perhaps I'm a bit jaded.  People have to eat.  But do they have to pontificate loudly while doing so?  The screaming kids I can take.  It's just blind noise.   But there's nothing like hearing two loud women you don't know discussing food processors, moving into a new house, and a vast variety of boring subjects while you try to read quietly.  The guys looked as miserable as I was.  It was obvious that their wives were good friends, and they, in contrast, appeared to be merely along for the ride.   I know I'm a party-pooper.  But sometimes you just need or want a quiet place.  I don't mind people talking, but some people talk so loudly it's as if they need to be heard by the entire restaurant.  When you're sitting 5 feet away and can indiscernibly hear every word they're saying - too loud.  After reading the same page what seemed like four times, I gave up and about that time my food arrived.  It was excellent, by the way.  I ordered a portabello mushroom omelette which also contained Swiss cheese, onions, and tomatoes.  It came with competently prepared home fries and a few slices of orange.  I love the omelettes here.  But I don't know if I can take the ambiance.  It occurred to me that a simple solution would be to sit families with kids in one section, and introverted singles in another.  That way you can have loud with loud, quiet with quiet.  It really is so difficult to find a good restaurant in Toronto.  So many choices, but nothing is ever quite perfect.  For example, I love the food at Sunrise, but the business and loudness of the customers annoys me.  Other places, I love the ambiance, but the food is rubbish.  Lesson to be learned?  Never leave the house without your mp3 player."}
{"text":"Before writing this I scanned the other reviews. Particularly entertaining was \"they even have poached eggs\"! Wow, isn't that amazing! An all day breakfast place that has poached eggs! To cut right to the point, this place sucks! And to be sure that I have it right, just ask to use the bathroom before you take a seat. Once you walk through the dirt and grime in the service area, you'll be convinced I'm right.  I still smell like the grease and smoke in the place, 3 hours after being there. Its worse than having a sizzling fajita spilled all over you. This place truly, well, sucks! It has all the charm of a quaint Roncesvalles all day breakfast place. The pictures of specialty eggs benny dishes with mounds of fruit, in the window is certainly alluring.  We traded the quaint natural setting of Grenadier in High Park (because the breakfast also sucks there, but the surroundings are nice) for this place because it had \"sumptuous\" breakfast written all over the steam laden windows.  While intrigued by the house specialties (the same eggs benny ingredients arranged in several ways) I opted for the plain 3 eggs over easy with pea meal bacon and brown toast. My GF ordered the light breakfast with one egg, sunny side up and rye toast. After we ordered, the young trainee said \"wow, you guys are easy\", which led me to believe there are a lot of customers who have learned that the basic breakfast sucks and have learned how to order their food with improvements.  My eggs were over-cooked and the bacon was akin to shoe leather. After getting through the meal, the waitress asked the ceremonial question, \"how was it?\". I wanted to just let it go but commented that the bacon was very dry and tough. She apologized and said she would tell the chef. She then brought us our bill and apologized again, acknowledging that the the bacon was \"tough and rubbery\", but didn't take it off the bill or show any signs of compensation.  From the cold latte to start, to the rubbery pea meal bacon, and bread that has so much butter on it you could lube a car, and aside from a great location, this is one of the worst breakfast places I have been to. And until I shower, I will still have the scent to prove it. Eggsmart at the foot of Roncesvalles doesn't have the \"Sunrise\" charming location, but it's food is edible and you won't smell like a '40's diner grill when you leave."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. It's not cheap, but not too expensive (considering it's roncesvalles). The ambience is quaint and clean and it's nice at the front where it opens onto the sidewalk. Service is friendly and a little frantic/busy.   The Mexican style breakfast where it's and egg, and basically deconstructed tacos. Each bite is different which is delicious.   The spinach crepe with feta is okay, super light and the fresh fruit of the side is nice. But nothing to write home about. It is a soft crepe, not a crispy one and it's quite sparsely filled. Not your big breakfast ticket item."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was a little slow. But overall not a bad breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Their all day breakfasts are very large. Only 6 dollars for 3 eggs, toast, home fries, and your choice of sausage/bacon/ham. Other non-breakky menu items are smaller portions though. Decent service (was in group of 7). Would come again."}
{"text":"Sunrise used to be my favourite breakfast / brunch in the Roncesvalles area (last review was 4 years ago) but I feel like it's lost it's luster. Service is still good and efficient but the food itself I felt has changed slightly. Some dishes we had (Benny) didn't feel like it had much on the plate. I would still recommend getting some of the breakfast dishes which are a bit more filling."}
{"text":"Warm welcoming and homey, that's exactly what you need after a late night out and about. Sunrise Grill fits the bill! We were seated fairly quickly for primetime Sunday brunch, the wait was only around 20 minutes. I was quite excited for the crepe part of the Sunrise Grill, however the crepe menu was small and didn't have what I was looking for. Now, I understand this isn't Cora's and restaurants are trying to be concise with their menus, however breakfast is when I want to be completely overwhelmed with options. I did find something to my liking on the specials menus, a little twist on eggs benny with sun-dried tomatoes and bacon. The English muffin was nicely toasted (key to a good base to a benny) and the sun-dried tomatoes were plentiful. The eggs were poached perfectly and smothered in deliciously herby hollandaise sauce. I was slightly disappointed with the home fries. They were nicely spiced, however not nearly crispy enough. Breakfast at the Sunrise Grill is decent, but not the greatest. Please add more savoury items to your crepe menu and make your potatoes crispier!"}
{"text":"My bf and I stummbled across this place within the first year of our relationship. When we would frequent the local Mojo cycles bike shop.   It's a quaint little spot high on Roncy ave. The first time we tried it out. I think I was more impressed with it than our second time around.   Here's the deets:   They only accept cash or debit, which is important to know. No credit and I am not certain on cheques either.  So, my partner got the Eggs Bene and I got Heovos Rancheros. I would not re-order this again. Their tortillas did not taste good to me. I don't even know how to describe the abysmal taste. I don't know if it was the way they heated it up. On either a grill that hasn't been cleaned thoroughly, or in a pan with rancid oil. Either way, it didn't sit well with me at all. Someone else might have it agree with their system.  It did not with mine. And I know good tortillas.   I'm not celiac. But it's like the gluten in it caused me to feel really heavy and it was very sticky,  gooey and gluey going down. The kind of flour, wheat whatever that's simply way off. Perhaps it was the preservatives in the tortillas themselves.    The black beans...  I love black beans period. But these had no flavouring on them. It was as though they had scooped them out of a can and placed them on my dish. Not impressed.  Their avocado as well, scooped up the remnants from a shell/ half of a skin of an avocado and placed them on my dish. Usually at places that serve avocado. It is sliced beautifully and displayed as the gorgeous fruit it is. Clearly, not here!    Hmmm, don't know if their salsa was homemade or not but it too tasted as though it was one of those cheap brands, scooped up and placed in their ramniken.   Our experience occurred quite a while ago. I almost forgot our experience, as time does do that. But looking at the photos I have of our food. I recall quite vividly how we did NOT enjoy it. As we initially had. And it makes me very angry to think that I did not say anything at the time to our server.   Looking at what my bf ordered, both my portion and his, were rather small.  The service is nice.  Yet, it is unlikely we will return"}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy the small booth with wood sets (ouch).  Smaller restaurant (wouldn't want to go on a Saturday night) We went for breakfast because we want to find a good place close to home.  Tried this out because of the reviews.  I didn't enjoy my breakfast I tried the $6 breakfast and my boyfriend got a waffle.  3 eggs (very small, two dunks each and done).  Two slices of bacon and one slice of toast and some fried potato's.  My boyfriends breakfast was a large waffle (great size) with some strawberries, bananas, etc but the cream or whatever came with it was very mushy and chunky (still not sure what it was).  The syrup came in a small container which was enough for him but not for me had I gotten the same.  Service was good.  They put cream and mike in these small tall containers that when you tip it over you've got to do the Harlem Shake to get anything out... took twice as long to get the amount I wanted and I felt stupid using it.  The sugar was the same way but it poured out better however the tip was dirty from people sticking the hole tube into their drink and sugar was stuck all along the inside of it.  The tea I ordered came with its on tea pot and loose leaf which I loved!  Don't think we will go back for breakfast but maybe to try their crepes."}
{"text":"Sunrise feels like the happy medium between an IHOP and a mom and pop's. The decor and service are thoughtful. The menu is sizable. There is a wall mounted flat screen showing the menu's specialties on loop. Their food quality is consistent. It's never too busy, but also never too empty.  On my last visit, I had my usual eggs benny which was topped with dill hollandaise and sided with an especially colourful fruit salad. My brunch date also opted for his usual of three eggs with sausage and thick toast. Everything was good as we expected, but even better were our glasses of fresh orange juice.  Sunrise can be surprisingly busy on weekdays. I like how intimate the booths and tables are. Larger groups can join smaller tables together and strollers can be brought right up to the table side."}
{"text":"BARF-O-Rama!  Cashier gleefully coughed all over me as I ate my crepe at the table on other side of the register, UGH.   Would u like a side of FLU with that?  HA!  A pasteboard taste to the crepe, and stale, chewy reheated texture .  WHO the hell reheats a crepe?  Also, pancakes and crepes are served with real or whipped butter NOT sachets.  Wake up ppl!  Eck, bleegh"}
{"text":"Huevos rancheros are awful...everything is served cold, no spices or flavors, just the raw ingredients dumped on a plate topped with a fried egg. Cheese (from a bag) isn't even melted. I could have made this better myself and I'm not a great cook.   Maybe I made a mistake in ordering something they don't specialize in - however I probably won't be back to try. There are too many awesome brunch places in Toronto to waste a meal on a place like this.  Decent prices and service gave this an extra star - sunrise is probably fine if all you're looking for is a very basic egg, bacon toast kind of breakfast, but temper your expectations on anything beyond that."}
{"text":"The Amaretto French Toast tempted me. Oh, did it ever. \"Amaretto soaked french toast with almond slivers and fresh strawberries.\" I don't know why I didn't order it, but instead I opted for the omelette special of the day ($9.25): Avocado, Tomato and Swiss Cheese with toast and \"mounds\" of fresh fruit. Sounds great, right?  It was really just OK. I like my omelettes to be more of a scramble, sort of loosely folded together with the vegetables still intact, but this was more like a quiche or a pie. Perfectly round with the vegetables baked in, and as for swiss cheese - it was just plopped on top in the centre of the circle, just hanging out. I had expected it to be dispersed through the omelette. Also, for some reason m omelette tasted oddly like pizza. Toast was stale and forgettable. Fruit was great - kiwi, strawberries, watermelon, pineapple and hard grapes.   An extra star for the supercute lefty server with the accent. Yum."}
{"text":"Had a nice brunch out on the patio. We shared the bacon, avocado and brie omelette and the spinach feta and walnut crepe. Both were excellent as was the coffee. Service on the other hand wasn't. Had to call them over to take our order and to get more coffee (1 free refill) Food came out fast but we had to ask for cutlery, then we sat with dirty dishes in front of us for quite sometime on such a small table, then had to call over for the bill. I'm a server and I get how busy things can get but there was way too many bad things about the service. I would have rated it more if the service was a bit better because the food was good. Nice little place though"}
{"text":"Fine but not a great.  Got moldy grapes in my meal once.  It's fine if you want a big, cheap, meaty breakfast, but nothing impressive.  We used to order takeout, and I would order waffles with custard.  The first time I ordered, it was delicious.  The next 3 or 4 times I ordered, the custard was always runny and I had to crisp up the waffles in the oven.   It does have a nice big kid friendly back room and the service is pretty good.  Too bad the food isn't the best."}
