{"text":"Want to eat your pizza with hookers, bankers, and street kids?  i quite like The Big Slice, because the portions are gigantic (as promised) and very reasonable - $4.50 for a slice and a soda makes it one of the best pizza deals in town.  The dining area is super-sketch, and the staff are very unfriendly. But i didn't come here for friendly service and to not get stabbed. i came here for pizza, dammit, and The Big Slice delivers.  (Well, i don't know if they ACTUALLY deliver, but the pizza is good.)"}
{"text":"I've been going to Big Slice for many years now.  The majority of times I get great pizza there.  The crust is great, as are the toppings and cheese.  They use fresh ingredients there.    Occasionally it not as good as it should be.  I always ask for a slice from the last pizza to come out of the oven.  If it has to be heated up again, I usually leave.  I just think the fresh hot out of the oven pizza is great.  It's my goto pizza spot in Toronto.  The decor not great, face it, it is a dive but it got great pizza!  Life is too short to suffer bad pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Not just for the food.  The entertainment you get when you go late night on a Friday and Saturday is great.  Such a wide variety of people and most under the influence of some sort of substance makes for a good laugh every time.  The location could not be better and the fact that they are open so late is amazing.  As for the pizza, I like it a lot.  I always ask what is coming out of the oven next for a fresh slice.  I have tried the lasagna there several times and really like it too.  I will continue to go back whenever I am close by."}
{"text":"Big isn't everything.  I ordered a plain cheese slice. What I didn't expect was the the texture of the rubbery dough and plastic cheese."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza. Got email confirmation on order. Called to check status of pizza over an hour later. Was told driver was on the way. Tried to call multiple times thereafter and no phone was answered and no pizza was delivered. Safe to say I will not be giving this place another chance. If you're hungry and order here, make sure you have another place on speed dial."}
{"text":"A Toronto institution. Great for late night post booze pizza and entertainment. I take my family during the day for a more calm pizza experience. I always wait for a fresh pepperoni pie to come out and order 2 slices straight away. Dough is crispy, thin, with the perfect chew. The lasagna is massive and covered in cheese and the house made gravy. Worth a trip on a Saturday afternoon with the kids."}
{"text":"I LOVE  this pizza - great spot! Friendly staff, musics always going and they are open pretty late."}
{"text":"So sad to see this original Toronto landmark go... Thanks for all the late night pizza over the last 45 years"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some cheap and LARGE pizza slices. However, the pizza is average and they don't consistently offer many choices (as in the choices seem to depend on what they decide to make that day and/or what they have left that isn't sold yet). The price is fantastic for the pizza, which is why I come back.  I have not had any of the other foods that they offer (veal sandwiches, eggplant parm etc) so I can't comment on that.  They're open late, so come by for a cheap slice after a night on Yonge St."}
{"text":"Always walked by the place practically daily, one night after work my friend and I went in for a Slice. It's his usual late night snack.  Well they take Big Slice way to literally! Its on a thin bendy crust that you can either eat of the paper case or roll it up and then eat it. Its not the best Pizza in the world but it is not that bad either.   For the price and product its pretty good and being open till late night its the best lil spot when living in the area for a quick bite to grab.  Its good, but definitely nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"I called The Big Slice one night to see if they could deliver me a pizza. The man on the phone told me that they don't. I wanted to discuss further but he hung up on me. I called back and told him that I really didn't appreciate being hung up on him to which he blamed me for it. Hey The Big Slice I have some advice for you.... Get your shit together!!"}
{"text":"Big Slice was my mistress during my time at Ryerson.   The first slice I ever had there made me feel bloated & sick, but I persevered and pretty soon a slice of cheese with garlic dip became my go-to nightcap/comfort food/anti-depressant/pre-clubbing/post-clubbing/5-am-and-everything-else-is-closed type meal.   Bonus tip! If you have a significant other, let the guy working know just after he starts flirting with you - his embarrassment sometimes translates into free garlic dip.  Bonus tip #2! If you want a certain kind of slice, but there is only one or two slices left on the tray and you KNOW they've been sitting there for a while, let the staff know you'll wait for the next one. It takes 5-10 minutes for them to whip a fresh one up, but it's well worth the wait for piping hot 'za and uber melty cheese.  Bonus tip #3! Don't be shy to point at the exact slice you want. Some are larger than others.   I give Big Slice 4 stars for living up to its name and being the backdrop to many college memories."}
{"text":"The problem with yelp is that some people have a problem taking taking things for what they are. You are not going to find a pear and blue cheese slice here. If you want an artisan pizza joint, LOOK ELSEWHERE.   That being said, this hit the spot. A night of drinking with the boys, and I wanted something to eat before I walked home. The pepperoni pizza I found was huge, and cheap.  Thank you Big Slice. You live up to your name and you're open late. And for that, I will forever be grateful."}
{"text":"Slice is too big.  Note: My original review from years ago was removed by yelp because it, \"did not feature a first hand experience.\"  Sorry yelp but if you actually went to the big slice before, you would realize that the slices are too big. Too big as in the slice falls apart and looks like total crap because for some reason they think oversized pizza slices are a good thing.  I guess the rumors of yelp removing reviews if paid is true.   Sorry yelp but you are just helping to ruin the internet and make it into a censorship cesspool.    Love,  Jeff  P.S The slice is too big."}
{"text":"Big Slice gives you exactly what you want - a giant slice of greasy pizza at 3am for $4.  The pizza is NOT gourmet and the topping choices are basic. But it's much better than Pizza Pizza. Sure, it's a little shady, but it'll make your night (and your next morning) that much better."}
{"text":"Big Slice? I  think not!  Try \"Burnt Slice\" instead!  We were staying at the Ramada on Jarvis and ordered pizza at 2 am last night and this is what we got!  We paid $23 for a large pizza and it was burnt black under the crust for the whole pizza. I took pictures but can't seem to find how to post them here We wanted to call and complain but it was close to 3 am when we received our pizza. It was late and we were afraid that by asking for a replacement pizza, it may have been spit on or something else. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Really good, cheap, pizza, most of the time - if you're getting a slice make sure it's relatively fresh, and for take out I usually ask for it well done since they tend to undercook."}
{"text":"Place is BALLING. Arguably THE highlight of my first trip to Canada [and Toronto]. I come from a suburb of New York City where the pizza is pretty good. Was interested in trying some Canadian pizza at some point during my 3-night trip to see what was up. Walked from the waterfront all the way up to York on Yonge and passed The Big Slice on the way. Caught my eye, but I didn't stop to take a close look. Was really hungry after the walk and remembered the place that had intrigued me hours before. My buddies couldn't suggest anything better, so we went for it. So happy I did. What a unique slice of pizza. I did have fresh slices, though. Yes, slices. I bet I could down eight of those suckers if necessary. Reasonable and incredibly filling. A joint like this would make a KILLING in NYC. I'd love to have a slice right now, but I'm over 300 miles away!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.. attendant hung up on us.. cancelled order from Bathurst stating \"too far\" but never notified customer. Never delivered food."}
{"text":"This place is reason why I am still full the morning after. Big Slice is something you scream out at a party and are guaranteed to have at least two people willing to brave whatever weather to get their fix.   I've been here many times and I've seen some pretty weird things. I guess it's the location and late night hours. For example, maybe don't use the hot sauce? I once witnessed another table make a bet for to chug hot sauce directly from the bottle for thirty seconds. Entertaining at three in the morning, yes. Hygienic, no. Do we know if these things are cleaned often, probably, it's a gamble.   The slices are really big. I got the vegetarian, it comes with tomato, red onion and green pepper, maybe mushroom. Maybe. It was really good, but it was the second last slice meaning sitting out for a tad too long. You cannot imagine my saddness when I saw a beautiful fresh veggie pizza come out of the oven and onto the counter just before I was leaving. And I know what that would taste like.   All the craziness is just part of the charm and adventure. Dinner and a show. However, it's all about the pizza and Big Slice knows how it's done."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to rate higher.  I first went there in the early 80's.  I specifically remember a visit in 1984, where it was the first place I took my pizza-connoisseur friend from NYC.  It lived up to his expectations back then.  Jonathan K and I ordered a whole 14\" pie to eat in, half plain cheese (the baseline from which I judge all pies), half mushrooms/hot pepper/pineapple.  Without the distractions of toppings, there was a bit of a weird taste on the plain cheese side, something I've noticed at other pizzeria's.  Some herb in the tomato sauce?  That processed pizza sauce taste? I'm just not sure.  Anyway, it's a step up from Pizza Pizza, but definitely a step down from Bitondo's and Danforth Pizza House.  (I won't compare to Terroni or Libretto, 'cause it's a pie of a different colour.)  BTW, the pie only took 20 minutes from scratch, so if you've got a bit of time and a friend, order rather than choosing a pre-made slice."}
{"text":"$5 for literally an extra extra large slice and dipping sauce..why not! I tried the veggie and the cheese slice and both were delicious. Wow!  So busy at all points of day and night, delicious pizza! I freaking love it! There's always a steady line coming it so you know it's good. It's open till 5 a.m.   There's an ATM at the back if needed."}
{"text":"The king of midnight munchies.  Surprisingly good crust - thin, crispy, with the right amount of doughiness - best I've had in this (dirt cheap) price range. And seriously, it is a HUGE slice. Best time to come is after a night of drunken debauchery; the pizza seems heaven-sent, and the crazies just top off the night.  I will be back for the best cheap ($4) pizza I've had in Toronto, most likely not sober."}
{"text":"worst place please do not eat here or order they only take cash and pizza tastes like plastic"}
{"text":"This place has everything you would expect from a late night dive pie joint, loud as fuck beat that beat up techno music, hairy middle eastern guys behind the counter, vagrants outside begging for smokes, and greasy big ass slices of pizza.   If your drunk, hungry and in the area you will come here.  Why? Because it's the only fucking place open and it's much better than that industrial strength cardboard they serve at the double name place down the street.  So bring a few extra smokes for the bums, your appetite and you will leave happy."}
{"text":"Damn right I'm a fan, I've been hitting Big Slice my whole life. There are 4 main reasons as to why:  1) As a little child I can remember how big the slices used to be. I remember them being equivalent to say 3 standard slices of pizza. I also strongly believe that over the past 10 years the slice has become even smaller then what they used to be. Still massive tho.   2) It's mad cheap. For $5 you can score a solid slice with a can of iced tea or bottle of water for example. One of the cheapest most satisfying meals downtown.   3) I went to Ryerson for a number of years, and my classrooms were mostly in Kerr Hall which is just minutes from Slice. So in between classes and on my way home I frequented it. (Ryerson student discounts also available)   4) Open hella late. I think even as late as 4am on weekends. What's clucth is hitting slice on the way from a concert, club or whatever really. Especially satisfying during those moments.   In terms of the quality of pizza, overall it is quite enjoyable. If you are fortunate enough to arrive as they pull a fresh pie out of the oven,  you'd be hard lovin' it. Otherwise, the pizza is fairly fresh as they experience a high amount of turnaround throughout the day so slices aren't sitting around too long.   My favourite pizza is the Ground Beef & Pepperoni which is a staple there. You can also expect to find straight pep, Canadian (mush, pep, bacon) Hawaiian (ham, pineapple, tomato), cheese, and veg on the reg. Although I have never had anything to eat besides the pizza, Slice does offer lasagna, spaghetti & meat balls, Italian sandwiches and wings as well.  The pizzeria has seating for mad people, so you don't have to worry about finding a spot to slam your slice(s). There is an ATM at the back and staff have to buzz you into the washrooms.   Libretto's and Terroni's make \"Pizza\", Big Slice makes Big Slices."}
{"text":"What a gem! And I'm writing this primarily as a takeout and sit in for a quick eat type of review. The pizza is delicious fast food quality. You get massive pizza slices for the price you pay which is very minimum. Service is super fast and friendly. If your ever needing a hunger fix for cheap and are in the pizza mood this is your place!"}
{"text":"I don't remember much of my visit to The Big Slice, but here is what did make it to memory...  1am hungry walking see man with pizza ask where he got it hubby and i walk in proper direction walk in smile order get our pizza sit down smile eat walk back to hotel raid mini bar smile sleep dream of really good pizza check receipt it was not a dream, i did in fact have really good pizza"}
{"text":"The pizza is not the best but the price is and The Big Slice has become a must stop destination when I visit Toronto for a quick slice of pizza.  The variety is great and the staff has always been polite."}
{"text":"I was brought to this place by a bunch of friends claiming it was the best pizza joint in Toronto after a night out on the town and so I obliged and we went to check it out. They give you what you ask for that's for sure, one big ass slice of pizza and they are open very late. I quite enjoyed my slice but we also ordered what was supposedly an XL pizza. We were expecting what we saw coming out of the oven and consequently being sliced up into those big ass slices but instead we got what looked like a typical large from anywhere else. All that being said the pizza was delicious, it's not gourmet but it's definitely a great late night pizza dive."}
{"text":"The big slice? More like the big chuch. This is the only restaurant I've ever had to get a refund."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, sent the wrong sandwich and the pizza was without a doubt the worst pizza I've had in Toronto and basically all pizza in Toronto is garbage, that's saying something. Essentially a frozen pizza from the grocery store"}
{"text":"I baptize this place, and hence be known as a \"Dive Pizza Place.\"  I agree with many that nostalgia is a big factor with this place. No, I did not go to Ryerson but I lived nearby so I would pass by this place on my way from *XYZ* more times than I can remember.   Yes, the staff is friendly, I agree with other Yelpers, and although pretty flat  (aka:. thin) the slices where a good size and they tastes a bit like some of the ones I have in New York. And they tasted great! However when you are starving and had a few, many things, like a hot dog taste great.   I always ordered mine to go, however the few times I actually sat down and ate, well, this place is a mixture of a zoo, in the sense of the odd, tired, tipsy and skanky characters that walk in and it can just depressing.  The lighting, the tired looking decor and the simple, bargain bin furniture... Sigh.  In the end, I think one of the most important indicators whether a place is really good -nostalgia or not, is if you would be willing to trek it if you live far away. So, would I?  I live near Yonge and Bloor and I have not gone there since I moved out 4 years ago. Even when I walk by it still.   But if I were to be in the hood, very late and starving, I would go in."}
{"text":"Not Wheelchair accessible at all,  massive step at front door,  staff won't come out to help you,  before the old location at Gerrard &  Parliament burned,  I'd go there,  great place.   But now..   Nope,  if they refuse to be accessible,  they don't want my money,  &  I LOVE pizza.   So I hit up the PP,  accessible &  friendly.."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Very inexpensive. Only problem is that this place is dirty. The bathrooms were filthy! But other than that it was great..."}
{"text":"They're open late ('till 4am I think) and while their pizza isn't the best in the world, it's pretty good. The novelty of getting an over-sized slice never really wears off.  I come here all the time because the unfortunate truth of the matter is that Toronto's a city that closes early. It's nice to have a few establishments around that brave the night and provide options."}
{"text":"Oh Big Slice...  The more beer I consume.. the better your pizza tastes.  What I don't understand is why we can't get awesome cheap pizza in Toronto like NYC's 2Bro's (For $1 even!), Joe's or Stanton's PIzza?  *sigh*  My best Big Slice story was one really late night there, these girls came in and asked to join our table where one of them pulled out a pitcher of beer from her big purse.  It was freaking hilarious.."}
{"text":"It's a shame when your go to place for a good slice is no longer the same thing as it was in the past. The name is the same, the pizza looks the same and the prices haven't changed much but the pizza has gone from excellent to nothing impressive.  Back in the 80's and 90's, the Big Slice was the place to go for some authentic and damn good pizza. The dough was hand made and hand stretched, the sauce was fresh, the cheese was that mozzarella with a little bit of bite to it and above all it had flavour. It was worth the trip on the TTC just to grab a slice.  Owners changed, and the pizza remained about the same. Now, I don't know at what point it changed again but what is left is the Big Slice in name only. Yes, you get a big slice of dry, tasteless, soggy pizza. But to be fair I needed to try it more than once.  The first time was disappointing. The pizza looked like it had been there for several hours and tasted like cardboard. I told myself that maybe this was only an off day and I came too late. So the next time I'd order whatever was the freshest.  The next time I ordered the pepperoni pizza that had just come out of the oven and they were in the process of slicing. It was marginally better than the other slice I had but it needed some extra zip because like the old one it was severely lacking in flavour.  Finally, yesterday, I found myself downtown again and since I didn't feel like waiting in line at elsewhere I figured I'd give it one last go. And again, felt left down."}
{"text":"20 years ago, when the bar I was working at just down the street would close for the night, I'd stop in & pick up a HUGE pepperoni slice & it made my night complete. Since then I'd drop in every once in a blue moon & id be filled w nostalgia. I drove to The Big Slice tonite to have the same happy experience & was gutted to see the windows papered over. There won't be a place like this again. RIP The Big Slice"}
{"text":"Standing like a proud Lighthouse beckoning wayward sea pilots to shore is the most fitting analogy I can summon when describing the power and influence the Big Slice has held at the S.E. corner of Yonge and Gerrard streets.  What the Lighthouse has done for generations of Seamen the Big Slice has done for decades of late night club kids, students cramming for finals and sordid casts of assorted  ne 'er-do-wells.  If you can tolerate a steady stream of mid 90's techno drivel at ear popping decibel levels, a semi hostile loosely formed line-up where you WILL have to jostle for position, AND you possess the almost super human ability to digest pizza swimming in grease at 3:00am, then the Big Slice is for you!"}
{"text":"by far the best slice in Toronto not stingy with toppings place has no ac and they don't clean the tables off is where they lost a point with me"}
{"text":"when i  was a teen i took the subway downtown, bought records at the famous \"play d record\" and i would alyways stop off at big slice, it was a little cleaner and a little better tasting, still ok, but dont use the toilet, it looks a junkies fantasy (straight outta saw  the movie (part 1))... also right down the street there are the aspiring youth  hobos at evergreen (former squeegie kids) so i have to agree with melissa, stating \"sketchy area)...........just a note try  the swarma place next door it is awsome...."}
{"text":"It's aight decent pizza but no match for pizza in the mtero NY or Philly. The crust was too thick for my taste and the sauce was bland.  Service is aight they got to me pretty quick so I can't complain. I would eat here again if I stay in a hotel near by but I wouldn't go out of my way to hit the spot."}
{"text":"It's dirty and the staff weren't particularly friendly but huge slices and decent prices. It's fairly cheesy and greasy with thin, flexible crust. It's the kind of pizza I prefer. It's also open ridiculously late when your only other option is McDonalds. Great for a quick bite on the run. Don't take a date here."}
{"text":"Given that most of the hot dog vendors are packed up by 11pm in this stretch of Yonge, I've ended up here a few times looking for late night munchies after tossing a few drinks back in the area.  While this place is far from gourmet, if you want large slices with decent topping selections and on the cheap, look no further!"}
{"text":"Big slice, good taste. Kudos for using Basil in the sauce!"}
{"text":"So I just called to enquire about if they deliver to my area or not and he literally just said we don't go there and hung up. Like I was still saying thank you. Ew no manners gross!"}
{"text":"If you want a large, greasy, inexpensive slice of pizza - this is definitely the right place!   I always pick the freshest pizza or ask if there is one coming out of the oven soon since the slices are amazing fresh but horrible if they've been sitting too long!  It is a sketchy place though so keep your expectations in line. Avoid the bathroom at all costs. But the staff are friendly enough and they let us sit in the shop for hours - which is awesome since we go every week to play board games until the early morning hours."}
{"text":"The Big Slice is a college staple, but anyone who thinks that their pizza is dirty hasn't ordered a fresh pizza for take out.  They are known for having very large slices of pizza, and for being open until 4am.  Many post drink-town residents find themselves here before relocating themselves to their beds, and I think it's because of this that many people equate Bit Slice with barf (if it's the last thing you eat, you tend to blame that instead of the 30 beers you drank in 4 hours)  Anyway, trust me and try these guys on for size when there's sunshine outside.  Ordering a whole pizza is definitely worth it, but the major downside is that they are extremely unreliable on delivery.  I've had a pizza take 90 minutes to arrive.  Since then, I order for take out, show up in 20 minutes and awkwardly stare at them from a chair until my pizza is ready."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck pizza slice. Good price and will leave you satisfied which is rare for a slice. I find the pizza mediocer though. There are a lot of better tasting slices around just they usually are more expensive and small. I also love that every time I've been there the slices were either just coming out of the oven or hadn't been sitting around for that long"}
{"text":"The slices are big and it is open very late. As for the pizza, it sucks. No flavour what so ever and as greasy as it gets. The establishment and some of the patrons hanging around are sketchy."}
{"text":"last time i went to THE BIG SLICE, I watched a large rodent (either big mouse, or relatively small rat..) eating toppings in the window ledge area..  major bummer.  Spot has to deal with a lot of riff raff/trash in the area; crap corner."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie to you. The food is pretty great for such a low price. Not spectacularly mouth-wateringly orgasmic, but pretty good. However, I gave this restaurant one star because of the service. Not because I insist on high quality service at my shitty pizza places, but because the people behind the counter were blatantly racist.  Obviously, as you can tell from my picture, I'm white, so they weren't racist towards me (for reasons that I won't go into because it tends to make people mad). But they were racist to every single black person that entered the shop.  Whenever any black person approached the counter, the guy made them pay before even ordering. That's right, he just demanded 10$ before he took their order, and gave the change after the customer was served.   It was unbelievable, and I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Where do single, lonely, middle aged men go to eat pizza? Right here. The place is sadly occupied by men 35-55, unshaven, wearing sweat pants, blank stares, one per table. Now you know where to find 'em, ladies.  The pizza itself is, well, it is a big slice. $4 with tax. Not many varieties. Fairly dull toppings. More pizza per slice than Pizza Pizza. Better sauce and better crust. They don't slide the pizza back into the oven. The hot table keeps the slices hot and ready for serving. I like that. I hate having to wait for my slice to heat up. Sometimes they over cook it."}
{"text":"The service is so-so, the atmosphere is pretty basic, it's a total dive, but the pizza is fantastic. And there's no other place I have been to like it here in Toronto.  It's what the name says it is: Big Slices. Each slice is approximately the size of your head, or of your head if it's a perfect circle, a small pizza. The toppings are great, and there's lots of them. It's open until 5am most days, and the slices heat up quickly even if they're not right out of the oven.   Price is fair at a little over $5 a slice.   Worth the trip! Go now!"}
{"text":"A huge greasy piece of pizza for cheap at any hour. What more can I say really?"}
{"text":"One star for being open at random times. And another star for being so cheap.  But there are other options around. There is a 24 hour McDonalds one block north of College, and 7 west is 24 hours is you want an actual meal."}
{"text":"Update: July 18-2016: Please note that this location of the Big Slice has been closed since May 30, 2016.  It will be missed as I liked going there for lunch every Tuesday, hope you guy open up in the surrounding area soon!   Cheers.  Been going to the Big Slice for ages! I work in the downtown Toronto area & this is a quick place to grab lunch.  Don't expect a classy clean format, the dining area is very casual and people come in just to eat and take off after.  I can't comment on the delivery as I've always just went in for slices.  The Pizza Slices are a mixed bag since they have different people making it on different days, so make sure and choose one that looks fresh.  Overall it tastes great as it never has any overpowering spices. It's one of the largest pizza slices in the city.  I like to dab the grease out with a napkin before I eat it - especially if your slice has pepperoni, ham, sausage etc...  The service is very straight forward and seems neutral. (No smiles, but just fast service)   Bonus Note: Make sure and go on Tuesdays as the pop/water is free with a slice, so a big slice & drink is 5 bucks."}
{"text":"Good choice to eat at when you got a hankering for some cheap comfort food or the good old \"munchies\""}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I have never had Big Slice while sober.   Oh, college. It's 3:30 am, you're drunk and hungry. Who are you going to call? At 89 Chestnut it was A) Hong Shing, B) Garden, or C) Big Slice.  Big Slice lives up to its name. These pizzas are HUGE. 20 some-odd inches of huge! I would always order the breaded chicken cutlet, peppers and onions, and get my drunken pig on. My male friends were always amazed at the fact that I could eat 3+ slices of this bad boy, but man. It tasted like success. So basically, if you're wasted and you want to pig out on a pizza the size of a card table, DO IT UP! Get yo big slice on, bitchez!"}
{"text":"Fuck all the haters, I still end up coming here after a night out. No, you should not be expecting a Libretto-style Margherita where you can say \"ooh, the crust is charred to an appropriate blackness - how authentic!\" You get huge ass, thin slices of pie perfect for soaking up the large quantities of booze still residing in your gut.  Do heed the warnings about dining in, as you get some sketchy fucks hanging out here. But the slices are cheap, and filling, and delicious. I like the pepperoni and mushroom.  Get a slice and walk around Ryerson campus if the mood should strike you."}
{"text":"Ate 4 slices here and got food poisoning felt like dying for 36 hours. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I don't know how I used to eat here late nights. Horrible is a under statement. I felt so sick afterwards and I hadn't had a drink this time."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I don't like writing negative reviews but the pizza I ordered was wet eww! There was also a hole in the box! Very questionable and the delivery guy did not want to bring it up to our apartment because he was afraid of dogs.. we have a ten pound small very friendly dog."}
{"text":"Why does this place only have 3 stars? Are people seriously critiquing the atmosphere and the service? Its a pizza joint on yonge street for christ sakes and the slices are really big and really good. Not only that but they sell way more stuff than just pizza. Its like if san francescos pizza was actually good. They should just call it slice and everyone else should be expected to serve pizza this big. Normally places with this charm and appeal you'd expect to be cash only but they take debit, and they're open really late i think. Plus they give you coupons for free lap dances at zanzibar."}
{"text":"Oh this place reminded me so much of home while in Toronto, Torontoians (is that a word) if you're ever in DC feel free to stop by Adams Morgan and enjoy an American big slice of pizza.  Just like the giant slices of pizza in Adams Morgan, the quality of the slice and how much you'll enjoy will change depending on how much you have drank.  The drunker you are the more awesome you'll think it is, if you're totally sober or only slightly buzzed, you'll realize that bigger doesn't mean better.  I was in an in between place when I had The Big Slice, so the pizza was fine by me, they definitely don't hold back on the size, are the ingredients the freshest? No. Is the pizza really delicious? No but when you're drunk it will definitely hit the spot and satisfy any craving.  Also the best part of this place isn't the pizza, it is the foolishness you see when you stumble in at 3 in the morning and are met by a sea of other drunk people looking for the same thing you're looking for and that is fun plus a greasy over sized slice of average pizza.  Favorite part of the night, the dancing of what appeared to be homeless woman, I was sad she was homeless but oh so happy she was dancing.  Oh Big Slice good times, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I had heard a huge hype about the big slice. I walked in there and saw 4 flies squirming inside the pizza display cases, the ambiance was dingy and had me looking for roaches and rats in the corners. Disappointed I Walked OUT!"}
{"text":"Big Slice is located on Yonge just south of Gerrard on the East side of the street. Big Slice has always been a Ryerson staple and during the first year of my undergrad, I used to go there fairly frequently. Fast forward almost 10 years and it was time to revisit my old friend.  Big Slice is exactly what it claims to be - big honkin' slices of pizza. And its pretty cheap too. They usually have a few different kinds of pizza available and one slice should be enough for most people for lunch. The crust isn't super thick, its fairly thin, and there's a good spread of toppings on every slice, no big areas of just cheese. I had a pepperoni and mushroom slice and there was a great amount of toppings on it.   Don't get me wrong though, this isn't the best pizza I've ever had and it's not pizza I would necessarily choose if I had other places to pick from. But the proximity is key, the price is great and the food is decent. Service was very friendly and quick and if you're a student, you get a discount of some kind. There is a pizza pizza down the street but their pizza is so awful that I'd take this over Pizza Pizza anyday.  This is basically cheap pizza for a cheap price - exactly what you'd expect for a restaurant in an area typically overrun with students. I'll be back for sure and scope out the place a little more."}
{"text":"It tastes a lot like Pizza Pizza but it is a bit better and a lot bigger. Price averages out since it is a bit more expensive as well. Good place for a quick pizza slice for a large appetite. Nothing amazing however."}
{"text":"Their slices are decent. I just wished they cleaned up the place better because it was hard to find a clean table. I had to clean the table myself which really ruined my first time experience."}
{"text":"As a lifelong Toronto resident, The Big Slice was just part of the seedy downtown background. A dirty sign, grimy windows and transient crowd hanging outside crumbling steps would instead drive me north, the expensively gentrified pies of Yorkville, or South, to the Eaton Centre and points beyond.   Last week, I attended a training session at College Park. Lunchtime options nearby are limited, and the location and price were right. So, I sidestepped the tough guys outside, and waited on line for the chance to enjoy a Big Slice big slice, sitting at what looked like a repurposed office chair, under a delightful poster of Freddy Krueger.  I'll admit to food snobbery, but the slice was fantastic. Retro pepperoni and mushroom; the kind of pizza that I enjoyed as a kid, before I knew from terroir, or micro-regional differences in soil, or woodburning ovens. The pie came straight from the oven; too hot to touch, and pooling with neon-orange grease that threatened to course down my chin as I ate. It was huge; easily a slice-and-a-half's worth of the immediate competitions. It was authentic in the way that it satisfied those basic childhood cravings; the texture of a blistered crust on my tongue; the tang of pepperoni, the feathery feel of shaved mushrooms...the mixture of salt and grease that said this meal was a special treat.   And all for $4.20 with a can of diet pepsi (we all have to grow up some time, don't we?).   There may be more grown-up pies out there, but to me pizza is first and foremost kid's food. And for providing that childhood the experience of folding a slice that's bigger than my head, even in very adult surroundings, The Big Slice deserves its place in Toronto's culinary landscape."}
{"text":"+ Big Slices -  Not so friendly staff  I've been going here for years.  The quality of slice you receive depends on how long the pizza has been sitting out.  When it comes fresh out of the oven, it's the best, especially the deluxe slice (bacon, green peppers, pepperoni, mushrooms, extra cheese).    The staff is never that friendly when I go in.  Would it kill them to be a little chatty?    For those that complain the slices are too big, just ask them to cut the darn thing in half?  Problem solved!  Decor has gone downhill over the years, needs o be gutted and freshened up, properly."}
{"text":"The Big Slice is open late, but their food is pretty horrible.  I am not a Ryerson student, so don't have any nostalgic sentimental feelings about this place.  Also, when I went I was blasted, so could actually sense my taste buds.  I'm not sure what the appeal of this place is aside form the nostalgic factor and the late night factor."}
{"text":"Biggest slice ever versus sketchiest block ever. It's a tough decision.  Big Slice has decent pizza for super cheap -- definitely a key component of an education at Ryerson. Plus they give you a discount if you're a Ryerson student. But I am no longer a student, slaving away overnight at editing suites two blocks down. I can now afford to go elsewhere and not be frightened off by the...interesting array of people who congregate in front of here, whether they're from the Youth Drop-In Centre a couple doors down, or Zanzibar (skeezy strip club).  If it is really late and you live around the corner like I once did, then Big Slice is your place. Otherwise, take it or leave it."}
{"text":"So, after waiting in rush line for two hours (with one to go!) at Ryerson for the film festival yesterday, I was hungry. Starving. Famished. I needed something big and I needed it quick.  Luckily, the Big Slice was just around the corner. I had never been there before, but had often passed it and know someone who swears by the place. So I bravely ventured in, ordered a slice of pepperoni and walked the maaaassive piece of pie back to the line up. On the way, I got stares and someone even loudly exclaimed \"that's a huge slice!\" Indeed, random street guy, indeed. The slices ARE huge, the name is not a lie.  Now, I was so hungry that I could have eaten cardboard and given it at least a 2 star rating, so it's possible that if I decide to return, that my 3 stars will turn to 2. The slice? Not that great. It had been out for awhile, I think. It was very thin and floppy, and tasted average, or maybe a little below, thinking back. Not that I minded at the time.  Overall, might only be good in case of emergencies."}
{"text":"It's huge and dry. .. Around $4 a slice ..  The only good thing about this place is they open till 5 am."}
{"text":"Slices are HUUUGE and cheap, and the service is very friendly. They're open until 5AM, so late night benders at the Dungeon/Library, rejoice!"}
{"text":"The first time I actually went here was last year. I was actually looking for a Pizza Pizza nearby, but this place just happened to be there with the words \"Big Slice\" on the sign.  I decided to go in to have a peak and saw that their slices were decently priced at $4/slice (If I remember correctly).  When I received my slice, I now realize how the place was named, it was the biggest pizza slice I've ever received in my life. I don't remember tasting the greatest, but it was definitely a different experience and one that I remember pretty vividly."}
{"text":"Big Slice is the best bad decision you'll make on a Friday night.   I had the the Meatball Sandwich. An enormous serving of meatballs, served on a kaiser bun with peppers, onions, mushrooms, marinara, and some sort of cheese (mozarella?)--  it was a true saucy meaty delight.   Eating here everyday would surely put you in an early grave, but when you're craving a hearty slab of sandwich, Big Slice can't be beat. It's horrible for you, but when you want it, you WANT IT!   ..don't go there sober. For realz."}
