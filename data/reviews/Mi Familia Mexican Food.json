{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar. The food is great and service is prompt. Can't beat the fact that it's walking distance from my house! It does get pretty loud and cramped for space on weekend nights though as they regularly have a DJ and I have even seen a band play one night. Still, great little cantina."}
{"text":"I like Mi Familia pretty good. A little pricier than I would like, but it is not outrageous. Not very authentic if you ask me, but that's not a problem for me."}
{"text":"Green chili burro was really good!!!! The tamale was not!!!! The girl that took our order only screwed up 3 times but that's what you get for cheap food!! Have gone on a Friday night and the bar was packed."}
{"text":"The only thing I recommend here is the Chimichanga, and even though it is good, there is no sauce on it, which contrasts much of the great mexican styles in the area. Do not expect the best walking in here."}
{"text":"Great place with great food and spirits. Best Happy Hour in the valley 2-7pm everyday. I'm a huge fan of the chicken enchiladas with green sauce on top with rice and beans on the side. The Chicken quesadilla is very excellent as well and your able to spilt the meal among two ppl easily. The unlimited chips and salsa is a plus as well."}
{"text":"I had been passing by this place since it opened a few months ago and after a late night of work decided to stop in for some food.  I have to say that this is the blandest food (especially for mexican food) I have ever had.  I walked in about an hour before close and they were already closing their debit machine and I had to wait for it to complete before paying, no big deal, and the girl up front put my order in right away.  The price was OK and they did have a nice liitle salsa bar, but over all the food was not good.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and margaritas! Margarita Monday today $1.49. They have the best enchilada sauce, family friendly, and local family-run business. We come here weekly."}
{"text":"So happy to see this place grow! They've expanded and now have a pool table and darts.... full bar, great menu, great food!"}
{"text":"Great family owned place! They are all sweet  and the food is really yummy!! Oh yeah, they even have Thrifty Ice Cream!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is meant to be a small, family owned, strip mall, Mexican restaurant.  It does that very well.  It is not the best food you will ever have but it is darned good!  I typically go here two or three times a week and recommend it regularly to people."}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would. The food is horrible and the staff is so slow and unfriendly. If this place is family owned, a family who can't cook should not go into business. From the fake cheese to the canned meat, this place is just plain gross!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It is not your typical localm casual mexican food restaurant. Their food is super fresh, inventive and they have some healthy options. I like the salsa bar as well. In a neighborhood with few options that aren't chains, I like supporting local business."}
{"text":"Bland and slitely overpriced. This is what I would expect Mexican food to taste like in Canada. Also, with your meal you get a tiny helping of chips, seriously there may be 10 whole chips in the basket. If your in a pinch I would go across the street to Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"A wonderful little family run restaurant and bar.  The bar tender remembers your name, the waitress smile and remember, a great place for families."}
{"text":"The best thing this place could do is decide whether it wants to be a sports bar or a Mexican food place because it's not great at either. Having been there a few times, I can say the \"Mexican\" food is no better than Taco Bell, so if you want a place to go drink a few beers that is local, then this might be your spot. On the other hand, if you want to know why this part of the valley is a wasteland for culture, especially food, the fact this place gets business is why no real restaurants will open up here. It's too bad because the income level around here could support it. Definitely won't return to the location until somebody new opens up in their spot, or they get a visit from Restaurant Impossible."}
{"text":"Food was very salty. Did not taste good. Was brought out very quickly, wait staff was super nice.  Food was just not good. You can make better tacos yourself."}
{"text":"My wife and family have been to location at least twice a week for some time close to home. last Friday 8/18/2017, was one of the worst times I have been to this location? Took for ever to be waited on, once we were took for ever to get our drinks? My wife and I order the same thing every time, beef fajitas and chicken burrito for the wife. Well I was brought chicken fajitas and the wife beef burrito? In which I understand things happen. Here is my complaint the waitress whom never wrote down our order came over to our table and told my wife sorry I know that is what you ordered REALLY my wife has never eaten beef???? and my fajitas were wrong!!! If the waitress spent as much time taking care of the customer's as she did hugging all the regulars there that night our order may have been as we ordered! The whole thing to me was unbelievable! We know what we ordered and nothing was done with our bill other than blaming us a loyal customer for some time that we ordered wrong come on."}
{"text":"So tried enchiladas 2 different ways. Both sauces red and green both tasted almost the same. Instead of chili's flavors it was more like a light brown chicken gravy, very bland. I ordered ground beef for my son, it was shredded. I had chicken loaded with breast meat but it needs  seasoning any kind. We tried the wings. OK ok my bad, they were.breaded and soggy. I noticed a change in kitchen staff. For the worse."}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday to pick up a take-out menu and ended up leaving with a chicken & bean burrito enchilada style in my tummy.  I thought it was delish!!  Great salsa too,  although they could have been a bit more generous with  the chips.  I think they gave me 6.  Don't expect anything fancy since they serve everything on styrofoam.  I will go back again soon to try other items...."}
{"text":"I went there to order some to go, and was very happy to go home and eat. However I was very disappointed. I ordered a taco, which was 3.99, and it barely had some chicken with onions. I also ordered some nachos, they have the saddest nachos ever. The cheese wasn't even melted, and they have a small amount of chicken strips on the top."}
{"text":"Do not expect to be overwhelmed with a beautiful atmosphere when you walk in Mi Familia Mexican Food Restaurant. Start thinking strip mall, Roberto's or Fredericko's with a Rocky Point type bar attached and you will not be disappointed! We went on a week night and had great service. Our server was very, very attentive and sweet. The food was outstanding! The portion size was very big (took 1/2 home) and had very good prices. Happy hour prices are great! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We think it's perfect for what it's meant to be - an inexpensive but quality Mexican place.  We have been there about 4-5 times to dine-in, and we will be going there anytime Grandpops is in town.  I can not confirm that I have been there to pick up a carne asada burrito right before they close.  The salsa bar is nice - between the 4 of us we have to make 3 different combinations of salsa.  We would give it 4.5 stars if we could - had to give it a 5 to balance out the others.  It's family friendly - small dining area - can only seat around 25-35 people.  Definitely a family owned place, which is a plus in our minds.  They are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Only palatable if you are a gringo who has not had anything with actual flavor.  Good atmosphere if your intent is to need an uber because you drank too much.  However, If are looking for food that has flavor even Taco Bell from across the street may be a better option!"}
{"text":"I really hate to say anything negative about a nice family owned neighborhood place........but, the food is just awful!!!  Very bland, salty and usually cold.  We stopped in on 2/14 and the chips were so bad you couldn't even eat them, tasted like they were cooked in old nasty oil.  The beer is always cold, guess that's a plus."}
{"text":"UGH!!  so disappointed!!!  I've been here a few times and enjoyed it for the most part....but since expanding it....they seem to have hired on more staff that is just TERRIBLE.  we had a to-go order that i asked my husband to go pick up.....i ordered the pollo fundido with a side of rice.  my husband came home with something that looked like a burrito with a little pile of wilted lettuce on the side.  okay fine.....restaurants screw stuff up....i've worked as a food server for most of my 20's to know that it happens sometimes.  so i got in my car to take it back and ask them to right the wrong.  THE GIRLS AT THE COUNTER ARE JUST AWFUL.  i got all kinds of excuses about how she was typing when i called in my order and that's why she got it wrong.  whatever girl....just fix my food so i can get home.....now that i can't eat with my family.  she forgot to add rice to my order and then acted like she was doing me a favor by telling me she wouldn't charge me for it.  good thing.....cuz i didn't bring my wallet or purse.  i sit down and wait for my food........it shows up like a minute later.  NOW that's great service.....i thought.  i grabbed my bag and headed out the door.    I left thinking that the order was right.   They wouldn't dare screw it up twice, right?  WRONG.  i got home to find my pollo fundido covered with COLD sauce and unmelted shredded cheeses.  the whole thing was ruined.....cold.....unedible......it's fried.....i wasn't about to microwave it.  so i called the restaurant at this point instead of driving up there for a third time.  I got the same girl that screwed up my order in the first place. \"oh....sorry about that.....but you can come back in for a free meal another time.....but let me get my manager to make sure we do that\"........a couple of minutes later.......\"yes ma'am.....our policy is that when you come in you can have a free pollo fundido\".......what?  how is it free at this point? you still haven't fixed my unedible meal at this point.  it's not free......and what if i don't feel like pollo fundido next time?  \"sorry ma'am.....that's all we can offer you\"   O-kee-dokee.  i asked to speak with the manager (Erika).....she then tells me the same thing the counter girl had told me.....not willing to fix the problem for customer satisfaction.....on top of the fact that she sounded even younger than the shrew working the counter. at that point....i was done. all the reviews about the girls working the dining room are correct.  they were all standing around while i stood there waiting to talk to someone about my order.....looking at me....then looking away......i mean....how about a \"is there something i can help you with?\"  i doubt the owner reads this.  i have seen a few responses to yelp reviews....but usually only thanking people for good reviews.....so i'm sure this will disappear into the abyss of internet reviews......maybe after you have to close your restaurant due to your staff's inability to have attention to detail in YOUR family owned establishment......maybe then you will read these and understand what happened.  it wasn't the food......the food is usually pretty good....enough to keep me going back a couple of times previously......but your staff.......tsk tsk tsk......such a shame. how about you teach them to check the food before it goes out?  ain't that hard!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food ....Taco shells and chips from a bag! Salsa from a jar! Save your money, go to Valley Luna at this price point ."}
{"text":"It's OK Mexican food and the service is spotty at best. Sometimes we get attentive and personable servers, but more times we don't.   The self-serve salsa is nice, as are a few of the dishes, but nothing stands out. Beware on the weekends or during major sporting events, the place gets crowded, rowdy and rude quick! So peek your head in and see what kind of crowd you have before you bring the kiddies.   If you're looking for noisy, no kids, sometimes raunchy (and by raunchy I mean loud gals with the vocabulary that would make a sailor turned truck driver blush) atmosphere, decent Mexican food and are OK with spotty service since you are blending in as said loud gal or guy  - 4 stars. If you're looking for great Mexican food, consistent and NICE service where you can bring the kids - definitely 2. Thus the 3 star."}
{"text":"Chicken quesadilla was decent (this visit), pollo asado burrito was dry (first visit).  However the service..sucks. I was there for one of the blues jam nights. Came in and sat down along a wall, since I didn't want to take a table (by myself). The server who had that section (female, tall, red hair in a ponytail) never even looked at me. Never came to me. Never offered a menu. People who came in after me and sat at a table in the center received menus and chips and...service.  After literally 20 minutes (I timed it), I finally went up to the cashier/bar area and spoke to a server (female, short dark hair, tan) who took my order, brought it over to me, came by to offer me refills several times.  The other server HAD to see this happening.  I gave the brunette server a 50% tip ($5) because she was nice and served me. I hope she didn't have to pool that money with other servers.  If it weren't for the blues jam, I see no reason to ever return to eat there, the experience was so bad."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting downtown Phoenix Mexican food, but was looking forward to a good burrito. Highly disappointing.  Tortillas were cold/crunchy, burritos were mainly tortilla. Maybe it was grocery day for Mi Familia. I'm almost sure the taco shells are made before hand and then sit until someone orders a taco.  \"Salsa bar\" was pretty cute. Salsa was watery and bland, too much pepper & not a lot of substance.  If your going to offer chips & salsa, deliver. We got a small 3 inch in diameter Styrofoam bowl of maybe 12 chips.   Del Taco does better."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!! Amazing food. Amazing staff. Amazing prices!! We frequent this place. Happy hour is EVERY day from 2PM-7PM."}
{"text":"Food is decent.   Their tamales are dry, and the green Chile recipe is made different all the time.    Sometimes it's too spicy, other times, it's fine.    The service is not the greatest."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous!! My waitress lost my credit card while trying to charge me for my meal. She took it away with my bill and didn't return it. I understand that things happen but what's most frustrating is that no one cares there. I have left the owner numerous messages with no return call. The girl I spoke to on the phone said \"I just work here\" and that the owner was in strawberry until Monday and won't call me back.  This is ridiculous!! You lost my card!! You should care that you lost my card!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 different times but just haven't been impressed.   It's close to home so I really wanted to like it, which is why i gave it 3 chances.  I ordered 3 different dinners as well.  The bar atmosphere is nice, but i just don't like their food very much.  I've been eating mexican food across the nation for about 2 decades now so i'm pretty picky, as I've had the good stuff.   Taco Bell is close so I will probably just go there."}
{"text":"Been here a lot   Mostly because there are no other bars in the area.  Food isn't this places strong point   Also it's way over priced   However the service is really good   Except when it isn't.  Seems like there are a few great waitress and counter persons and some younger girls that don't belong in the business. My wife and I live in the neighborhood and just about every one we've talked to has pretty much the same sentiments about this place as we do.  Too bad!! It could be a great place and a real moneymaker but somebody is dropping the ball"}
{"text":"This place has a good vibe for football but we took the family there to eat this Sunday morning and 1 hour in still no food. We ordered 3 burritos, French toast, and pancakes. When asked about the wait the server was rude and told us that is how it is. The food finally came and they gave everyone the wrong burrito. After a bite of each burrito we all realized no one had the right one so luckily it was family and we switched. The pancakes came out raw and not cooked. When asking for a manager they stated no manager on duty and nothing they could do. Guess they don't care about the customer when they mess up. No accountability and the customer definitely does not come first at this place."}
{"text":"I find the food to be tasty, but have noticed a significant decline in service and speed over the last several weeks.  Too bad, will need to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was so excited that a Mexican food place was going in so close to home! However all three times that I have tried it, the food has been awful! Although I have several complaints, my biggest is that the food is incredibly bland, the salsas are terrible, and they do not even have a true red chili sauce. If they could learn to make a breakfast burrito like Rolando's, I would be there every week"}
{"text":"Went there in search of a good breakfast burrito. I found one. Food Price was decent for what i got. (Ham, potatom cheese breakfast burrito) The girl behind the counter was friendly to both myself as well as my 3 year old.  The only negative thing I have to say about the food, is the hot salsa was on the mild side, but then it could just be my taste (or lack thereof)  Opt for water, as the soda price is too steep."}
{"text":"Great place!  --good location, ample parking, lots of seating alternatives  (booths, tables, bar etc.) --great Menu!!  --our food was GREAT, and the service VERY good.   Our only concern was what was supposed to be background music was way too loud.  --I couldn't even hear my dinner companions."}
{"text":"This could possibly be the worst Mexican food in town. We had 4 people ordered normal dinners ,drank water and it cost $85.00. The food was so bad that I could not stand more then one bite of my burrito , and there was no way I was taking it home. They also advertise that they serve liquor that they don't have, so stay away if you're looking for a cocktail with diner. Sad thing is that the area needs good local restaurants that take pride in their product. I live less then 1 mile away and will drive by every time. Please don't waste your time here. Much better food in town."}
{"text":"This place is a lot larger than I expected walking in. The bar selection could make Scottsdale clubs green with envy. Everything on the food menu is less than $8... The Yelp reviews didn't leave me with high expectations. But my shredded beef chimi was great! It didn't have any cheese, onions or peppers inside but still packed a lot of flavor. I also liked the chips and salsa. My server was nice. The only thing I can complain about was that they use plastic silverware and styrofoam plates... The hippie in me (also a Sustainability Major) wanted to shed a tear, but I just took off a star instead."}
{"text":"I have now been here three times. Each time I'm  more disappointed. Enchiladas had no red sauce on them. Food is pretty bland but honestly you get what you pay for. No a bad place to go to have a cheap meal but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!! We drove by and saw a bar and tvs. We thought, lets try them out. We ordered a margarita. It was so bad, we had to add a packet of sweet n low to them. It was still un drinkable. The menu doesnt describe anything so you have no clue what youre getting. I have an out of state licence and the bartender looked at it for literally two minutes. Two sips in we asked for the bill and left. We were too turned off to even order food. Oh, and the chips and salsa? A joke. Salsa is pure water and the chips are salty and stale."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and the food is great.  I'm always a fan of a place with a salsa bar but the salsa here is top notch!!   Most of the time I do not sit down for the wait service but the staff up front is very friendly, and always on it."}
{"text":"Two stars is a bit generous. The salsa was good and the service was good.  Other than that, we were quite disappointed.  My two taco combo with shredded beef was tasteless at best.  The tacos were loaded with cheese that obviously came from an industrial bag, as you could see the powder coating that keeps it from sticking together. The shells appear to be the preformed pull em from a plastic sleeve variety.  The cheese on my luke warm beans was the same, and nowhere near melted, as duh, they were not even remotely hot.  Rice was basically flavored air.  I switched with my son, who was not enjoying his breakfast burrito.  It was a little better, but eggs were soggy, as was the bacon.  My husband said the chorizo completely lacked flavor.  We won't be back.  Stinks because this is so close to our house.  Were huge Mexican food fans, so we would've become regulars."}
{"text":"Good local place, good food and great price.  Recently expanded so this hole in the wall is now a big hole in the wall!  Great place to stop off and enjoy a chicken burro enchilada style!"}
{"text":"Great place to unwind and enjoy good food and drinks. Live bands or DJs on Fridays are the best!  I highly recommend!  You'll become family once you set foot inside. The staff is friendly and the service is fast"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is getting such bad reviews. It is legit Mexican food, decent service and reasonable. It's always packed on the weekends and evenings. Bar is usually full of regulars (which I'm not- sat at bar twice), but bartenders are nice and on top of it. This is our go-to and is not the closet joint."}
{"text":"Mi Familia at 67th Avenue and Happy Valley Road is my favorite local Mexican restaurant. What I enjoy and appreciate most about Mi Familia is the flavor and freshness of their food, and that they don't skimp on ingredients. For example, when I order their enchiladas with rice and beans, they're not flooded with sauce and cheese as you'd find at many restaurants. You can actually taste the chicken, tortilla and every other ingredient on the plate. And speaking of the chicken, whether you order an enchilada or a taco, be prepared for a very healthy serving of it!  The only complaint I've ever heard from family and friends is that their food is not the spiciest, but I don't mind at all. They offer a variety of salsas and sauces to enhance the flavor or hotness, and I assume you can ask for your dish to be made spicier.  Given that the restaurant is conveniently located 3 minutes from my house, and that their turnaround time on takeout orders is never more than 10 minutes, and that Mexican food is my all-time favorite cuisine, Mi Familia is one of my go-to places for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  My favorite dishes at Mi Familia are their chicken enchiladas with red sauce, hard shell chicken tacos, chorizo breakfast burritos (possibly their best dish -- great flavor, lots of substance and rarely greasy), and beef tamales."}
{"text":"Great food and soooo reasonable. Happy Hour prices are great too"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The food is ok, not spectacular.  The prices for main dishes is reasonable.  We've been twice and both times my wife had ordering problems.  She prefers her enchilada in a flour tortilla and they absolutely refused to do it.  The second time we decided to get Chimichaungas.  We asked them to be enchilada style and they wanted an additional $3 for that...That seemed out of whack.  They finally agreed to do it for a dollar.  Also, if you eat in you get free chips but not if you take out.  So that became an argument.  The chimi's had decent flavor but lacked filling.  I would agree to under seasoned food.  Though we probably won't return I don't think it is awful.  Hopefully they will read the comments on here and make some adjustments to price."}
{"text":"I LOVE fast Mexican food! I had such high hopes for this place.  I'm trying not to comment on the ridiculous wait for a fast food Mexican joint since it's only been open  2 days.  But we waited 35 mins, we wanted it that bad.  We ordered the Pollo Asado and the Machaca burritos.  SO disappointed.  They were tasteless and unsatisfying.  Pollo Asada: -Boiled Chicken wrapped in a flour tortilla -No flavor -No other fillings -Measly amount of chicken  Machaca: -Onions, green bell peppers and shredded boiled beef -Flavorless beef -Measly amount of filling.. more tortilla than filling  We won't be returning anytime soon.  So sad."}
{"text":"Came in today for the menudo since its on the menu. They never have it consistently even though it's on the menu for Saturdays.  Salsas are good and the burritos are okay, but the menudo on the menu for Saturday isn't really available.   Changed to 1 star when my wife started to clean her dirty cutlery."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it was super small. The food took awhile but it tasted good and always good service. Now it's a joke. Bland, tasteless, straight from a can, food. They pretty much don't make anything from scratch anymore. It's all prepackaged, store bought. Don't really care for the bar scene at all. So wish they didn't do that. Only ever get take out here. Portions are smaller, and for the first time I've had food missing from my order. They forget sour cream, sauce, rice, and beans from a chimi. I don't go out of my way to get food here anymore. If someone picks it up I'll eat it but at this point I'd prefer taco bell."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service not so much. I ordered a pint each of beans, rice, and salsa and was only given a half pint of each. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Store bought taco shells, really? How hard is it to make your own - corn tortillas are cheap and so much better! Jarred salsa? C'mon guys! It's sad to see all of the Gringos' be fooled by this place. It doesn't take much to make really good AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Use real red chile pods to make your red chile instead of the powdered/canned stuff. Try using real roasted green chile instead of canned Ortega! A crock-pot or an olla de frijoles/beans  instead of the gross kind you serve, out of a can, I'm sure will go a long ways! Give something this neighborhood really lacks - AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD. It's at your fingertips. More emphasis on the TASTE of your food, and less on your loud dj/band music & cervezas, although that's about the only good thing you've got going in this place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos and strawberry enchiladas. I had the bacon, egg, cheese and potato burritos, while my fiancee had the egg, cheese and potato burrito. She found the burrito to be a bit tough on her stomach, but I had no problem. I would do t he breakfast burritos again but pass on the strawberry enchiladas. The strawberry enchilada was decent, just boring and a little soggy. The breakfast burrito was satisfyingly large and delicious.  The place itself was relatively clean and super casual (we took carryout but ordered in-store). There were a variety of drink options available for self-serve with free refills - soft drinks, \"red juice\" and horchata. There is a salsa bar with various salsas and pico de gallo. The salsa options can be packaged to go, as well! There are a few flat screens in the dining area that were broadcasting the news and sports while we were in there. Pretty rad! The service was as expected at a sort-of fast food spot. Nice enough, no frills.  Oh, and as mentioned... they offer Thrifty Ice Cream!"}
{"text":"absolutely HORRIBLE service!! a group of friends and I came to dine in and no one came to speak to us for 15 minutes. the girls that work here are unprofessional & very rude. would never recommend coming here to anyone"}
{"text":"Agree w/those who knock the service, girls are dim at best rude at worst and slow UNLESS you go for breakfast then it is a totally different place. The lady at the counter was very nice, appreciative, prompt and professional. Food is OK but close and inexpensive so we go occasionally. Won't ever be our first choice for dinner but good for breakfast burros."}
{"text":"Hey peeps FYI  this is a great neighborhood go to place and the food for me is just ok ! It's not bad and not killer good but very very suitable for a quick neighborhood gathering ! The bar is always packed so get there early on the weekends !  If you go enjoy!"}
{"text":"Who dreamed this up to have serve Mexican food on one side with ice cream next to the salsa bar and have a full blown bar on the other. Both not inviting both sides need to staff because all they do is sit in their phones instead of asking customers if they need anything. The music on the bar side is blowing the customers away on the other side. I actually felt bad for the customers eating over there. Oh it gets better your food comes out in baskets like your in Texas eating BBQ. Don't get me wrong I love Texas BBQ don't see how the serving baskets fit into Mexican restaurant???? Overall one and done with this place. Oh and the food is awful"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place at all.  The tamale I ordered was the same as the ones I buy Frozen at Costco. The hard shell taco I think it came from Taco Bell. I don't know how they did it, but the salsa had no flavor. The refried beans were dry and I suspect they are dehydrated and then rehydrated. One cheese enchilada, 1 hard shell taco and one tamale was $17. That's crazy! I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Have been several times in the past few months.  Favorite thing so far is the taco salad.  Had the daily special today of chicken tacos with rice and beans with drink. Loved the chicken.  Nice and spicy, not bland and boiled.  Always clean, always fast, always friendly.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I am here once a week. The reviews definitely don't reflect the how great Mi Familia is. I would consider it more of a hole in the wall place, but it honestly adds to the charm. Their Green Chile Pork Burrito is outstanding, and their chips and hot salsa is great too. Combine that with $1 domestic beers for happy hour, and I am one happy camper."}
{"text":"A lot of mixed reviews here but our visit was pretty good. We stopped by last night for dinner and a comedy show. The place was packed! It is an odd set up with a sports bar area, restaurant/open table concept and then a take out section as well. Strange but, doing the best with limited space I guess. Anyway we were lucky enough to wedge in for dinner, drinks and the show. Service was fast and friendly. Drinks came out fast considering the volume of people in there and the food did too. The food was good. The four of us had loaded nachos, cheese enchiladas w/ red sauce and a pollo fundido. Rice was very good, ref beans were okay, and overall the food was good. Was it the best fundido? Nope, but it had plenty of chix and cheese - no real complaints. The show was great and the drink service did slow down a bit as the night went on but, that doesn't bother me too much.  No this will not become my go to mexican joint however, I would definitely stop in for a couple of drinks and a quick bite every once in a while."}
{"text":"So far after a couple of trips I would recommend the carne asada (awesome) & breakfast burritos (stuffed full of mex favorites) and probably not order the ground beef or chix tacos (small/store bought shells/dry/a little bland). Staff was friendly and wait time was just right. We will be back to try a few more items for sure.."}
{"text":"I love Mi Familia because it is close to my house.  However,  I am going to breakdown this location in 5 parts (Food Quality, Happy Hour, Beverage Selection, Cost & Service)  Food Quality - 2 Stars - Their Mexican food is average at best.  Most of it is very bland with not much flavor.  However with that being said, their pancakes are great.  Also, they have Thrifty Ice Cream which is the best.  I give it a 2 Stars because they should have better Mexican food.  Happy Hour - 4 Stars - They have good daily specials and Happy Hour drink choices.  It is a good place for cheap draft beer during Happy Hour.  Beverage Selection - 4 Stars - Their beer selection is average.  They only have a few taps so there is not much they can do here.  However, their Margarita selection is great and you can get a great Bloody Mary (especially delicious in the morning with my pancakes).  That helps to bump it to a 4 Star.  Cost - 5 Stars - All their menu items are really affordable.  You won't break the bank here.  Service - 5 Stars - The staff is always super friendly and on point.  They can get a little slow when it is busy on the weekends, but that only happens once in a while.  I have to give a shout out to Tom (bartender) because no matter what I order (Margarita's, Bloody Mary's, etc.) it always comes out delicious.  Overall, this is a really good place.  If you go for drinks I would recommend Tom's Bloody Mary or even the House Margarita on the rocks.  Be careful and don't drink more than 3 of them if you want to accomplish anything the rest of the day.  My wife loves the Georgia Peach.  On a final note, if you are looking for a quite place for a romantic dinner this is not the place for you.  If you are looking for a place to hang out with a lot of fun people who can tend to get loud, then I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Every time I try this place I'm disappointed. Food is bland and never has enough seasoning.  Come on its Mexican food. The pricing is a joke and overpriced. I tried to order 3 burritos so first the pricing says $5.99 for a burrito.  I think that's normal but it comes with meat, cheese, and cabbage and any options are an additional $1.00 each or more.  Whatever happened to a supreme burrito?  They don't offer it. They want me to build it for $9.  I let Mi Familia know that I was taking my business elsewhere. Too bad they're right around the corner from me."}
{"text":"Typical not special Mexican food, but over priced.  Service varies from great to pretty poor."}
{"text":"Love everything I've ever had here. They always have live music. Once a week or more. And an annual cinco de mayo festival. Wish I loved closer! The food is good and if you wanna stay late and have good drinks, they have that too. TVs all in the bar for games, etc. great place to hang."}
{"text":"Food is good, but not what I would expect for the price. Got 6 tacos to go, had a $20 in my hand, had to go back go to the Wallet for more cash.   I thought they had the wrong order, nope. First and last visit"}
{"text":"Yummy! Yummy! Yummy!  Carne asada chimi, pollo con queso, chips and a salsa bar that is outa sight.   Bean tostadas, nachos, tacos.   It's all good and served by people that love to feed your spirit and your body.   Check it out"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Mexican food places I've eaten at.  I came with my five kids who all ordered something different.  Everything tasted cheap even the cheese was gross. Salsa was just ok.  Inside ambience lacked attention to nice detail and was about as cheap as the food tasted.  To top it off smokers were smoking right outside and we smelt it the whole entire meal."}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit here.... I had high hopes for this place until I over paid for what looked and tasted like a microwaved frozen burrito.. well.... there goes $9 bucks and 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back, wasted on a circle k style burrito...... NO OFFENSE CIRCLE K!!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood spot. I love this place for the quality, variety, and freshness of their food. The service was amazing and the food exceeded my expectation.  I had the beef enchiladas and Beef tacos and they were fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This is close to my house and it always seems busy so we gave it a try. The food is served in to go containers and Styrofoam plates. That tells you the quality of the fiood. I love Mexican food and I couldn't even get through half of my meal it was just so flavorless. That was our first and last visit."}
{"text":"Used to be regulars. Not anymore. If you like raw eggs - like make you sick raw, extremely poor service by the tall guy, and overall extremely bad food, this is your place."}
{"text":"It's so rewarding to see a small business grow. Growth usually points to someone doing business right and that's the case with Mi Familia.  The neighborhood Mexican restaurant/full service bar is rock solid with their food, drink, and service.  It's not Barrio Queen or one of the other high end Mexican restaurants Phoenix has to offer but I've never been disappointed here either (and I'm proudly the Duke :)  The P(rincess) and I have been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner-all with the same results-tasty food, an excellent salsa bar, and great games on the numerous TV's.    The red chili beef burrito is my go-to and I highly recommend it, it's excellent and huge! The breakfast burritos are very good, especially with a gin and tonic on game day. P loves the tostadas with a side of rice and beans which are delicious.  The place is loud on game days and has a great vibe to it (and occasionally live music).  Check out their app for additional specials!  So glad these guys are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Amazing service - Great food for the price - and UNBELIEVABLE ENTERTAINMENT...Especially when Risque Band is there with Cece Ya and Les Paul Roque!   Happy to have this type of establishment in our neighborhood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for lunch. We sat at a hightop table for over 15 minutes waiting for service. I had to walk up to the bar and ask if I needed to let them know we needed service as we had been sitting there for 15 minutes. A waitress said no someone would be right with us. I went and sat back down only to have our waitress take chips and salsa to a table that came in after us!!! As she was doing that all the lazy waitress were staring over at our table talking about us. Everytime we go in there the waitresses only want to serve the regulars and flirt around with them! This is the second time this has happened to us!! We will not be going back again and I will make sure everyone I know doesnt! We have only had one waitress actually be pleasant to us and  havent seen her latley. I am assuming they let her go because she was just to nice and didnt have a shitty sour puss face!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the NW Valley! Great food, drinks and fun place to hang out. Definitely a family owned and operated business."}
{"text":"Tonight I decided I was in the mood for Mexican food. So came here to enjoy the food like we have in the past I got the #36 and ate tamale, been and rice. Then moving on to tostada but was as I was removing some of the lettuce I notice a tiny bug moving in the lettuce. I didn't make a scene informed waiter he took off a taco off my bill but honestly the rest of my meal and experience was ruined stopped eating paid and left. So gross. Waiter was very friendly but cook staff should of caught that. Not sure I will ever return seeing as how I don't want to have to inspect my food before eating. Sad because I loved this place."}
{"text":"Always up for trying little local places, I decided to stop in and check out the menu.  Pretty good selection (if you have both Chili Colorado and Chili Verde you qualify as that in my book) and Thrifty Ice Cream to boot.  The carne asada is pretty well seasoned and the meat is a good quality.  My wife enjoyed the chicken tacos, but they were a tad on the greasy side.  The quesadilla was plenty loaded with cheese, and the sides of guac were really nicely seasoned.  We've been back a couple of times and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is in a neighborhood area in a strip mall, it's kind of an unusual set up, you can order at the counter to go, or you can sit in the bar area, or you can sit down for a meal. It's kind of like a combination of a Mexican restaurant in a sports bar. And it seems to be a biker hang out. The service was good, although we weren't really sure if we needed to order at the counter or if a server would come to us. It was different because they brought chips to the table and then bowls and you had to go fill your own salsa. Their breakfast burritos are good, I guess the atmosphere is a little bit undefined. I wasn't sure if it was for families or a biker bar??"}
{"text":"This is a nice little neighborhood mexican food place that beats the nearest competition - Taco Bell - hands down. Most days, you pay prices that are what you would pay at any take out place that isn't fast food, except on Tuesday - Taco Tuesday is great! I'd take one of their tacos any day. The place is cute and always busy during happy hour. There is an area for sit down service and then an area for take away. Not a huge menu, but a variety of types of food under each category - tacos, burritos, etc. Add to this, breakfast service, and no wonder its busy. Salsa and chips are tasty. Add some hot sauce to anything to spice it up.   Service is good - mostly young people who play around a little, but get the job done. I appreciate the fact that this is somebody who appears to hire high school kids so they get some job experience before the real world.   It's close to home and quick. Who cares about what the food is served on. If you want fancier - then drive further. Or, take it home and eat it on your own dishes.  Its a good little place and I've been more than once. Oh and on this last Taco Tuesday - fed two people with a soda for under $10.00!"}
{"text":"I came to mi familia today and sat on the to go side to dine in, the cashier with blonde hair seemed like she had no idea what was goin on, i walked up to the counter to try to order dessert and she was off to the side dancing and i had to wait more than an appropriate amount of time to even order more food, if this is how the rest of the staff acts i will not be returning."}
{"text":"\" The Band tonight\" One man doing a handy bandy job- was terrible!! whoever it was please go try your hardest at  your day job!!!! yuk so terrible...... never going back."}
{"text":"Huge fan. I had the green chili pork burrito enchilada style and it was spectacular. I was here for the margarita special 1.79 house margaritas all day Monday. They were great. They have trivia, karaoke and live music. I'm really glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I'm excited to finally have a casual and affordable place to eat in the hood!  I walked up there this morning for a delicious chorizo burrito and I wasn't disappointed.  The person working the register was very friendly and actually funny too.   I will say when I've been there in the past they've seemed a bit scattered but not this time.   Just hoping they'll stick around a while."}
{"text":"I love this place. We go here a lot, and would do so even if they weren't basically around the corner from my house. $1 margarita Mondays are my favorite. The food, admittedly, isn't all outstanding (but I LOVE their breakfast burritos and that they serve them all day) but definitely is good. The best part is the service. The servers are super friendly, and you can really tell it's a family-owned place. Also, a great value for the money."}
{"text":"Mi Familia is a standard suburban Phoenix Mexican food restaurant located in a small strip mall. The restaurant has a full bar and is optimized mainly for drinkers who want to eat instead of eaters wanting to drink.  The menu has some decent breadth, but the entrees are fairly bland optimized for a gringo palette. I sampled the tamale and rolled tacos. Both were light on flavor and a bit dry. Chips and salsa were just ok with decent drinks.  Eating around 9:30 was during a rather loud DJ with a rather drunk crowd. With so many great options in the area, it is hard to recommend this as a good neighborhood Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Always incredibly friendly people, and very very good Mexican food. Take the time to check this place out, you really won't be disappointed for the price. On top of that they sell Thrifty ice cream my god what other excuses do you need?"}
{"text":"Great staff.  Friendly bar patrons. The best cheese steak I ever had.  They call it Mexican Cheese steak. For some reason it's only served during football games, but I'm hoping it's on the menu permanently.  It's a no frills restaurant with excellent food.  Owner is a very nice man who gives back to the community. Daughter  Erica is a very good general manager. Bands every Friday night.  Great neighborhood restaurant/bar. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I eat here often and i have to say it gets better every time!! The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly! The manager Tony is a awesome guy and will be quick to chat it up with you and make sure that your taken care of. I always enjoy coming here!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to north phx and i was so excited to find this great little Mexican food restaurant/ Bar. I was instantly pleased with the very good service, and the food comes out so fast you hardly have time to fill up on chips and salsa. They have a salsa bar so everyone can get the kind they like. I think their breakfast burritos are hands down best I've ever had. Their specials are great too, especially taco Tuesday. My kids love this place to! Seriously i can't find a single complaint. I will be here weekly!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on a Friday. Wasn't expecting much, just looking for a cheap bite, I expected it to be another version of filibertos. It was nothing like that at all. Guests could enjoy a full service dinner or grab a quick to go order while enjoying their full bar, and salsa bar, as they wait. Their machaca beef was delicious! Perfectly cooked and seasoned! And my husband loved his chicken burrito. So happy this is right down the street from our house! We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu & the $1.49 Margarita's on Monday nights!"}
{"text":"If I could only give negative stars this would be -5. The service is horrible, a bunch of people walking around pretending to do work and not helping customers. Bartender was texting on his cell phone the entire time we were there. Our server was rude and confrintational like we were bothering her making her work. Food is served on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils,  real classy. I could suffer through everything if the food was good but its not! Bland, greasy and no real Mexican flavors. Salsa bar tasted like someone opened a can. I'm confused is this place a bar or restaurant because it gives off a tashy bar vibe especially on their Facebook posts. The margaritas taste like cheap tequila and bargin basement mixer. Save your money and go ANYWHERE but here, hell Taco Bell is better. FYI they did NOT card an 18 year old that was in our party. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Literally THE WORST Mexican restaurant I've been to in my entire life and easily one of the top five worst restaurants of my entire life regardless of the type of food served.  How does this place stay open?  Just to be seated, you are literally accosted by the hostess as to your plans for your visit. For example- Will you be ordering food, and if so, how much? How long do you plan to stay? Question after question like TSA.  Then, once seated, the Manager (?) will come over and ask how soon before you plan to order food.  Mexican restaurant always means a sample of their Margarita...right? Lol...it tasted like water with squeezed lemon and a dash of powdered margarita mix...I kid you not!  Literally one of the top 5 WORST restaurant experiences of my life.   So, so much more to say, but I have to get back to my life. I will come back and add more info later."}
{"text":"We love this place! I go here for taco's and rice & beans for breakfast when I'm all hungover. The food is so much better than \"Fredirico's\" ..and who wants to eat there anyway?? Staff is real nice, they have a cool bar and flat screens with Direct TV..not expensive..Good Mexican Food!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for a couple years. They have something going on every single night whether it be a DJ, karaoke, family trivia night, or just some kind of music. Everybody knows everybody and you'll find a lot of firefighters that hang out here. Lots of great people! Now to talk about the food, it is absolutely to die for. All the tortillas are homemade and everything is authentic and mouthwatering! Try the green chili cheese burrito!"}
{"text":"This is not the first time I have eaten at this restaurant or ordered food from them. I will say that I have never been real impressed. On this day I called to place a to go order and waited for 15 minutes. While on hold (8 minutes in) I just made the decision to go ahead and drive to the restaurant to place my order who knew how long I was going to be on hold. As I was arriving to the restaurant the line was disconnected. . Told the girl that I had been waiting on hold for 15 minutes and that I had just decided to drive here, her response was sorry. No I will make sure they will rush your order. Not good service. Just confirms my thoughts about this restaurant. Not great"}
{"text":"Wow, I hope the food is good. I came here to pick up an order that was placed a few days ago. They didn't even start making it. They started making it, and told me it would be ready in 25mins. That was about 45 mins ago. Still waiting. Now the bonus is that I'm getting all my food for free, but so far this place seems a little dysfunctional. I will say that Carly who was the person helping me with this issue is awesome, handled everything like a pro. She needs a raise. She is also major reason I'm giving this place two stars."}
{"text":"This is a good little place to stop for lunch or breakfast if your in the mood for Mexican food and near the intersection at 67th and Happy Valley. It reminds me of some Mexican \"dives\" I enjoy in Tuscon but it's a new place, not a dive but their food taste like it's made in a dive, so it's a \"new-dive\"...  This is a locally owned place with a different spin on Mexican food than the usual.    I've stopped by a couple of times and I like their breakfast burritos and their Carne Asada Chimi's. Their chorizo/eggs/cheese with green chili sauce breakfast burrito is very tasty and huge!  It's almost too much for one person... Their shredded beef tacos are a bit bland and they use shredded cheddar cheese (as stated above, they have a different spin on the usual Mexican food, cheddar cheese on tacos = not a good time nor good eats). Their salsa is good but taste and looks like the salsa at Caramba's.   After you get past the overuse of plain shredded cheese and the stryro-foam plates and cups it is an A-OK place to eat. I will probably go back to try other things like their specials.  They have \"Tortas\" on special this week!"}
{"text":"If the owner reads Yelp:  Dear Owner,    Fire your counter staff.  I think they're terrible.  I'm assuming they are your daughters/family because I cannot imagine them lasting very long at any other restaurant.  They seem rude, disinterested, disorganized, slow, and immature.  They don't seem to give a darn about the reputation of your restaurant.  Even if the food was 5-star quality, I would still not return because of the counter staff.  -Darlene P   Now for my review:  Unless they change their ways, DO NOT EAT HERE.  I really, really wanted to like this place and patronize a local restaurant.  We live very close by and were hoping this would be our go-to place for Mexican food.  Been to this place 3 times, all of them for takeout and all of them either bad or mediocre experiences.  First time I walked in was their opening week.  I was the only one at the counter and the girl behind the counter was writing something and didn't even acknowledge me for a minute or two.  She wasn't super helpful when I asked about menu items.  I brought home a chicken burrito for my husband and a chicken chimichanga for myself.  The burrito was cold, dry, and bland.  The chimichanga was warm, but it was also dry and the meat tasted burned.  It looked like normal cooked chicken, but just tasted really burned.  It was as if they had burned the outside of a whole chicken really badly, but just cut off all the blackened parts and still served up the meat that didn't look burned.  It was weird.  We shrugged all of this off as opening week issues and decided to give the place another try.  Again, we really really wanted to like this place.  When my husband went another time there was a line at the counter to order.  While waiting in line he noticed that the counter girls were really slow to acknowledge the next people in line, even though the girls themselves weren't too busy (they were checking their phones and nails, etc, between customers).  They were slow to take orders and even had trouble taking orders, like they couldn't keep track of whether the customer had said chicken or beef and had to keep going back and asking.  When the finished orders came through the window, they mixed up whose order was what and kept giving out the wrong things.  When my husband got the food home (tacos) it was just okay, nothing great.  The last time I went was one of the WORST takeout experiences I've ever had.  There was a line and, again, it was slow moving.  There were only about 6 people before me, but I waited in line over 10 minutes just to order.  When I finally got up to the counter I was not acknowledged in a timely fashion (even just a \"Hi, With you in a sec!\") would have been fine.  After another couple of minutes, I ordered two combination plates and an order of mini chimis to go.  She said it would be about 10 minutes.   There were no seats at first and hardly anywhere to stand, so I had to stand near a trash can and almost blocking the front door for 10 minutes.  Then finally a table opened up and I waited another 10 minutes.  By this time there was no line and it seemed I was the only one waiting for food.  I was getting annoyed now and was about to inquire about my order, when I saw the counter girl look toward me, seemingly realizing that I was still waiting.  I then saw her turn to the kitchen window and heard her ask the cooks about my order.  I could hear them talking and it sounded like they had lost my food ticket.  Seriously!?!  She searched around and found it.  Then she turned toward me and shouted across the way, \"Did you want chicken or beef mini chimis?\"  I could not believe it.  This was more than 20 minutes after I had ordered them and been waiting!!!   She offered no explanation or apology for having me wait longer, just spoke to me as if I had only been waiting for a minute or two for my food.  After I answered \"beef\" she told the cooks, and my food was miraculously ready about 2 minutes after that.  Then my ticket number was called out, and my food was left on the counter.  Again, no apologies, no explanations. NOTHING.  I was so appalled, annoyed, and angry that I didn't even want to get into asking about the poor service.  I just took the food and swore to myself never to go back....and to yelp about the experience.  Bottom line:  Stay away because of the counter staff.  I get the impression they couldn't care less about the customers.  The food, which I find to be cold and/or bland or just okay, isn't good enough to overcome their horrible service.  Such a shame because I would still occasionally go for decently priced \"okay\" food if I actually liked the service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Their pollo chimichanga fundidos and tacos are bomb! Sweet little hole in the wall where everyone is friendly and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"If I could give three separate ratings, I would.  The female owner gets 5 stars. She's awesome, friendly, talkative, interesting and gracious.  Her daughter, Erika, on the other hand, has ZERO personality. We frequent Mi Familia for breakfast burritos and usually drinks, and despite our frequency, Erika still could care less that we continue to come back.  She seldom smiles and speaks only when spoken to.  Two weeks ago we went in for our normal weekend breakfast and they were out of bacon (who runs out of bacon in the morning at 8:00?). I joked that I would go to Walmart next door and pick some up.  Not a smile. Not an, \"I'm sorry.\" We turned around and went to Hot Bagels.  THEY are wonderful.  For the food, the breakfast gets 5 stars. Their burritos truly are great.  But spare yourself the money (and hunger satisfaction) on lunch or dinner.  The chips are always stale-tasting, appetizers are clearly pre-frozen (not fresh), taco shells eh... Drinks get 5 stars.  They are cold and quick. We love Melissa (waitress) but she's only there two nights a week. The others are unfriendly, disinterested and oftentimes unattentive.  So I'm sure you're asking WHY we keep going back.  It's close. It's comfortable. And they have good and bad days.  If only their management would read these posts and fire their staff (i.e. family) and start with some fresh, smiling faces... THAT would make all the difference in the world!"}
{"text":"Rather boring dishes without a lot of flavor. Not terrible, but in a city full of great Mexican food there are better options."}
{"text":"I have been to Mi Familia a few times. It is pretty much a hole in the wall. Every time that I have been there the food has been pretty good. The reason why I give it a lower rating is because the size of the restaurant is just not up to standards. The majority of the place is dedicated to a bar area. It is pretty hard to take kids in and enjoy a meal when it is as loud as it is and there is no where to sit. We would probably go here more often if the place was set up more like an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"Have only eaten here for the breakfast burritos, but they are the best!  Chorizo can be hit or miss at some places but here its always good and not greasy!  They are a little over priced in my opinion, but we keep going back so they must not be too bad.  Also have an app where you buy 10 get 1 free."}
{"text":"Watch out for the little dick bouncer at night. Made me move from standing at the bar so one of his little hooker friends could sit in a chair. Then went to the bartender and cut me off because I asked why I had to leave my spot when I'd been there for over an hour. Standing at bar with 5 other people in seats paying big money for shit drinks also. Great training and patients paid off to not snap your little neck. Threatened to call the \"authorities\" because he didn't have any apparently."}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas! Love the Taco Tuesday specials, although it gets pretty busy in there. I'd recommend this place for anyone living in the area!"}
{"text":"We have dined here a few times during happy hour, and it's always busy. The service is decent, the food is very affordable (there is nothing on the menu over $8.00!), and they have a full bar with decent specials. The salsa bar is fantastic! The food is pretty bland, but for the price I can't complain. The dining area is pretty small; not a place you want to go with a large group of people. There are TVs so you can catch the game while enjoying a drink with friends. They are open everyday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Overall, it's an okay place, very close to home."}
{"text":"Really good red chili. I always get a red chili burrito enchilada style and it is very good"}
{"text":"I have found the food to be inconsistent.  They have used taco shells that you can buy in the store.  A been and cheese burro only had a small amount of cheese in the bottom and the beans tasted like they were out of can.  A cheese enchilada was smothered in red sauce and greasy.  They have a good clientele at the bar, people from the area."}
{"text":"For the price, this restaurant/cantina has pretty tasty mexican food! Red and Green burritos are very good! The servers are always very accomidating and pleasant. Much better than Top Shelf. Awesome happy hour. Great energy with fun customers! Chips need to be upgraded and fresh though. Will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Food was great and alot of it! There was so much to eat you will have left overs. Our waitress were wonderful too. Checking on us making sure our drinks and chips were always full."}
{"text":"Well, the service is always good.  Family owned.   The food is ok and some items are really good.  The drink specials are good.  I wish it just up a notch higher. We love the fact that there is a mexican rest nearby."}
{"text":"I really only make reviews if something is amazing or terrible. In this case it was terrible. My family of six went to Mi Familia for dinner and we were all pretty disappointed. It all tasted like something we could have thrown together with Wal Mart tortillas, canned refried beans, etc. I'm not a picky eater but it definitely didn't taste like anything I would ever pay to eat again. Save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurants serious the service is very good and friendly Sirius the food is always on time and delicious. It seems like there are a lot of regulars and the place feels very welcoming."}
{"text":"We didn't even get to eat here. They were so busy, and it is seat yourself, there is no host or hostess. Some people that came in before us went and took the first open seat that came available and then they got kicked out of that table for some people that were waiting in another area, so they waited some more and finally got a seat so then it should've been our turn for the next open table, a couple came in after us and the woman's husband went and looked for people that would be leaving soon and he found some and took their table he didn't give a f#!k that we were waiting before them. And his white trash wife went and sat with him. That place needs to get more organized when they are busy. We will NEVER go back there.  We talked to some friends of ours that had gone there regularly and they are not going there anymore either because of how unorganized they are when they are so busy. The place probably is not worried about people not returning because they are so busy, but we are not the only ones not returning. And I'm sure there will be more people that will stop going. We went over to TIMES 3 SPORTS GRILLE, on the other side of Happy Valley in the FRYs parking lot. The food and service is better at TIMES 3 SPORTS GRILLE. If you want great Mexican go to VALLE LUNA."}
{"text":"$2 Taco Tuesday - Soft or Hard Shell; ground beef, shredded beef, chicken or shrimp. Can't beat the price, great service, seated and served quickly. Food is pretty good, no complaints - 2 people, (5) Tacos, 2 Cokes, free refills, chips & salsa $20 with tip"}
{"text":"Great food, great people and Kelli is a great serverette. Try this place and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Love the food, relaxed and enjoyable environment. Great local place to chill and unwind."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. I ordered the tamales, which is my baseline meal for how good any Mexican food restaurant is or isn't. They were a little dry (but we were the last people in the bar to place a food order at 10 pm, so that happens), but the flavor was good. The beans and rice were not exceptional.  Wife had a fundido burrito that she liked a lot. I didn't get to try it myself.  Service was meh. I'm pretty picky about how often drinks get refilled and mine never got a refill after it was brought to me. The server was okay as far as everything else, but meh on that front.  Overall, it was just average, but Name That Tune is a game that I will travel for and I won't avoid Mi Familia in the future on Name That Tune night.  Tldr: Tamales decent, everything average, 3 stars."}
{"text":"two and a half stars, but I pushed it up because they have Thrifty ice cream and that reminds me when I was a kid growing up on 12 street and Northern always going for a $ .35 cent cone.  I like the atmosphere and the set up but I am not all that impressed with the food.  I have been here twice now and nothing grabs me to come back (except the ice cream).  I ordered a enchilada, taco, & tostada plate today and the food was just average.  I didn't even eat the taco, I wish the meat had more flavor.  The beans and salsa are also a test of a good Mexican place and those to was just average.  The tostada was the best on this plate.  I hate to not be a fan since this is the closest Mexican joint near my home but I sure wish I could crave going there.  After the owner was nice enough to contact me I will try it again after I meet him and ask what he may recommend for me.  After that I will most definitely re-review Mi Familia.  Thank you Jim."}
{"text":"Decent place, food is thoroughly average Mexican, but the place is nice, people are nice, and they have good, fresh salsa."}
{"text":"They just expanded there restaurant,  great place to hang out and eat some good authentic Mexican food. They also have live bands there a couple days a week. Nice little neighborhood bar/restaurant.  I would recommend everyone to come check this place out!"}
{"text":"It's simple, the food it yummy, the staff is (was) friendly and they have a full bar.  But here is the trick, if you are anything like me then u are always eating it at home since I'm not about to haul my 3 little munchkins in there for mommy to get a margarita with her chips and salsa. ... So, don't forget to order your chips and salsa if u have a take out order since it's an addition charge. My absolute fav thing on the menu is the nacho supreme with shredded chicken. My kids love the shredded beef taco or cheese enchiladas. Don't forget to use their mobile app for coupons and their loyalty program.  ---after a horrible customer service experience there recently (2015)  ---Update to previous review on 9/5/16. Mi Familia has continued to grow by leaps and bounds. Great for last minute dinner to-go but also a popular hotspot for north valley residents looking for a great place to enjoy some food Mexican food, margaritas and music!!  Spencer has been at this location for years and is always helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought we would try another Mexican restaurant in the area. We saw a add and thought about driving a little out of our normal territory and comfort zone. Well, glad we did !!  We were pretty impressed with this little restaurant. We kinda like none franchise restaurants ( family owned ) is our thing. Great specials all week, clean and the salsa bar a +. Also, the beer prices are good. Our server, Ashley was so helpful with the orders and making us feel so welcomed. She educated us about all the specials and the other location in Pine, AZ. GREAT EMPLOYEE !!  Food was great !! Be back soon.."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  And who can pass up Margarita Monday!?"}
{"text":"Last time I was here I received a frozen chili  rellenos and it was frozen.   Tried one more time to see how their happy hour was. Not good, no happy hour prices on food. Last time here mot the best food either."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre Mexican with kinda, maybe kinda cold beer, and bad bands. Not sure how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit this place for some time. Always pass by it and finally did today and it was sooo worth it. I know these Mexican food places are hit & miss in the north valley. There salsa bar was great. The hot salsa is very flavorful impressive. I knew this place would if been pretty good when I saw a grandma in the back cooking. I had two tacos rice a beans. There tacos were shredded beef tacos and the beef was pretty good and the rice was true Mexican rice. The beans were a little salty but still pretty good stuff the cashier guy was supper friendly and the restaurant was very clean and authentic for being in a strip mall. Go check it out! I'm picky about my Mexican food and this place was pretty good. I like to see them around long term so go visit!"}
{"text":"We went in here for the first time and this place came recommended. We waited 20 minutes to get drinks, and then another 20 to just get an order in. They had one waitress working on a Friday night and really wasnt THAT busy. They messed up the order and came back with something that looked like it was heated in the microwave. ( tasted like it too) I actually don't normally write bad rec's but we spent 35 bucks and 1.5 hours that we can't get back! Even when we said it wasn't that good they were rude and didn't ask if they could do something for us .  Would not recommend. Sorry...just a bad experience."}
{"text":"Very clean place, Great food, pico de gallo is awesome, TRY. The vegetarian burrito. Our server Steph is the BEST!"}
{"text":"We stopped in there for dinner expecting to be satisfied. 20 minutes later we demanded our money back and drove to Chipotle down the street.  We asked for recommendations. They recommended that we get the Pollo Fondito and the Nachos. The nachos are popular they said. That is exactly what we ordered.   We walked over to the salsa bar and I have to say that being a Mexican restaurant and having only 3 types of Salsas does not cut it anymore. My Girlfriend can not eat salsas hotter than mild. She grabbed the Mild and I grabbed the other 2. The server brought us some chips to eat with the salsas. The chips were stale and sub par. My Girlfriends mouth was soon burning up after she had the Mild salsa.   I asked if they have Mild salsa and the Manager said that they do not.  The food came out and we both looked at each other surprised about the presentation of the Nachos. We proceeded on to trying the Nachos. The taste was the same as Burning cheese on toast in a toaster oven as a child on an attempt to making grilled cheese. Right there I was done with this place and knew that Im leaving.   I decided that I should try the Pollo Fondito before leaving to see if this restaurant can make anything decent.  I was hoping the Pollo would be better than the Nachos made in a Prison Kitchen. I cut the Fondito open and I could smell the Gamee smell of cheap chicken. I took a small bite and I can now taste nasty and stale chicken. I walked right up to the counter and demanded my money back.  This place will be out of business in less than a year if they dont clean up their act.   I will try to post a picture of the Nachos"}
{"text":"The food isn't anything to rave about... they obviously value quantity over quality so they miss out on a lot of opportunities to improve the taste. The customer service at the take away counter is usually consistently shady as well."}
{"text":"I really love this place, the carne asada is fantastic and the nachos are great as well.  But I love it for another reason and here is my story.  It was quatro de mayo (I know cinco de mayo is not a \"real holiday\" and certainly quatro de mayo is not either) and in excitement of the upcoming celebration we decided to go out.  We started at a restaurant/bar that recently regained its liquor license and was a shady establishment already.  They were out of every common domestic beer and we had to get out of there.  It was getting late and decided to call Mi Familia.  Knowing it was not a holiday I asked what time they closed the bar and they said \"When everbody is done drinking\".  I was in love.  We headed straight over and have frequented it many times since."}
{"text":"Hits the spot when you are craving some quick Mexican food! I've always called it in to go. Pretty good food, better than taco bell"}
{"text":"Love the green chili burrito.  #34  Update:  they have expanded their space.  They now have a bar and table service.  They still have some things to improve, but our family visits here frequently because we like the food."}
{"text":"I use to frequent the first location on 67th and Happy Valley, but since I no longer travel in that direction I was extremely excited about this location so close to my home! I get the carne asada burrito enchilada style and its delicious. They have lunch combos and a little bit of everything. It's basically the only Mexican restaurant in the areas and it's definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Just walked out of this restaurant. Waitress told us to sit anywhere and we sat there for 15 minutes with no menu, no drink order, nothing. She looked at us as we got up and didn't say anything. The place was a little busy but not busy to be ignored that long. If she couldn't handle waiting tables she should have asked her boss or coworker to give her a hand. Not upset that I had to walk out for poor service as much as as her walking by us repeatedly and not offering to drop off a menu or let us know she will be right with us."}
{"text":"We go here about once every couple weeks for dinner and a few drinks. It's more of a family friendly bar, great prices, great food and on Fridays they have live music (like good music, I've never been there and heard Spanish music. It's always classic rock, band or no band.) Great time try them out."}
{"text":"Our first time trying Mi Familia last weekend, Right when we walked in, we werent sure how it worked if someone was supposed to seat us or if we could just sit wherever. Someone immediately approached us and welcomed us in to sit wherever we'd like. Our waitress was awesome! So nice and had lots of good recommendations for food, the machaca beef is amazing! Also if you like bloody marys, they are awesome here! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The best tamales I have ever had. Our server was a gem too. The enchilada was good, but I'd like to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Just had our first meal at Mi Familia after eagerly anticipating their opening for what seemed an eternity.   The location is very convenient for us as it's the only Mexican food place in the area (that I know of, anyway).   The set up is pretty standard for fast Mex; lots of color, music, self serve soda and salsa bar, with tables/chairs for about 40.   It's a new place in a new shipping center so everything appeared new and clean.   The Good:   Shredded Beef tacos in hard shell were tasty and well prepared. Shell was light and not greasy. Cheese was fresh.   Wife ordered carne asada burrito. She said it was \"pretty good\".   The guacamole was fresh and tasty. The pico was fresh and too spicy for the Mrs. but she's not in to a lot of heat. The salsa I got was flavorful and hot; a requirement for me to return to a place.   The  cheesecake sample they gave us (gratis) as a sneak peak was delicious. Can't wait for it to be added to the menu.  Food was ready quickly (maybe 5 minutes).   The Bad:   Portions seemed a bit small. My two tacos didn't fill me up, despite the rather large shells. The vegetables served on the side were too few to amply fill up the taco.   Wife's burrito was basically just meat and cheese. We were expecting some additional filling like lettuce, pico, or rice. They messed her order up originally, giving her a chicken burrito instead of carne asada. Owner who happened to be there took care of it immediately with no fuss.   All the sides like rice, chips and guacamole were fairly pricey extras; bag of chips $2, guacamole $1.50, rice $1.50 (quoting from memory but they were pretty close to that).   Lots (too much) of Styrofoam; rice bowl, plates, cups, etc.  Forks, knives and spoons were behind the counter so I had to ask for them after receiving my food.  Should just put them out by the salsa bar.  Final word:   The 1 star rating, IMO, was overly harsh.  Mi Familia was pretty good, but not great. We will return but hope to see the serving sizes increased slightly with the dishes a little more rounded out."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food not so much ordered the nachoes and it came with shredded cheese instead of nacho cheese wish it came with more beans. I enjoyed our serve so I'll come back and try something new."}
{"text":"Just visiting Phoenix. Thought we would try this out. The service is a bit slow but friendly. Love the salsa bar... Pico de Gallo was my favorite. Bacon wrapped yellow peppers were sooooooooo yummy! Taco shells seem homemade and was the favorite part of my dinner. Beef tamale was pretty good. The tostada was a little bland... same with the beans and rice. But for sure worth going back for tacos, salsa bar and bacon wrapped yellow peppers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in on a Friday night and were seated immediately. Our server was very friendly and efficient. The free chips and salsa bar were delicious. Sadly this was the only food that either of us enjoyed. Between us we had an enchilada, chicken taco, tostada, and a bean burrito. Everything was lacking in flavor. The chicken was too dry. Such a shame! We really wanted to like this place. Maybe we'll give it another try and update with a better review."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. The grilled chicken in the tacos is fantastic.    Not sure why there is a fence around the front door. Lose that. Also not sure why there is table service for lunch. A lot of people just want to counter-order for lunch.   Nice salsa bar.  I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food - great chimichangas, enchiladas, quesodillas, and burritos.  We got a to-go order for 8 people, the nailed the order and gave us extra guac and sour cream when we asked.  4-5 types of salsa at the salsa bar, and a pretty sweet place to watch a game as well."}
{"text":"Was great when it first opened. Now it's just a noisy bar. Wish they'd just focus on making good Mexican food at reasonable prices without charging extra for salsa."}
