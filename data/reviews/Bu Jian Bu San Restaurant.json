{"text":"I'm sad to say that as of writing this review, the resteraunt has closed. 

This was one of my fav joints for spicy hearty food. Their lamb with cumin was always tender and flavorful and the lamb skewers were moist and meaty. Alas, economy hits hard even the best of food places, and I've never seen more than one or two tables full in the place. Staff are SUPER nice and friendly, but their employees have dwindled down to mostly family members. 

Food is in good portions, delicious, but a little heavy on msg. I'm giving it a 4 rather than 5 because they really have not decored it great and the ambiance is a little low."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 but bumped up for friendly service and cozy home atmosphere. Another northern Chinese food restaurant in the newer plaza around Midland and Finch, with owners from Tianjin. Items in my opinion are very reasonably priced, and big portions. I personally recommend the pan fried dumplings which I found out is homemade from scratch and very yummy. The green onion pancake is also made form scratch, but rather average and nothing exceptional. I also ordered fried rice, with pork belly(?), and it was yummy with a hint of spice but a bit oily though I must admit. Overall, a cozy place to have lunch at. The tables also seem to have a hot pot function, so I may return for dinner to check it out before it gets too warm to order hot pot meals!"}
{"text":"Another \"No English Name\" Restaurant at the Plaza on Midland just North of Finch.

After searching everywhere on their menu or inside the restaurant, I really have no clue what's to call this place or make a listing on Yelp... until I saw Bu Jian Bu San Restaurant on the Public Health Pass Notice on the front door.

Homey.. that's how I would have describe this place.

Reasonable priced pack with value?

Sweet and Sour Pork Noodles ($5.99) sure filled up my tummy. The sweet and sour flavoured is from the pork while thin yellow noodle is swimming in a sea of hotness. Great lunch portion and comes with protein, carbs and vegetables! A complete meal.

Staffs speaks Mandarin.. a good chance for me to practise mine. Extra Spicy please?! Deliciously spicy? Always comes in handy.

I wondering what is \"Steamed Fish in The Stylish Way\"?? Maybe Peacock Style?"}
