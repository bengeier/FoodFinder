{"text":"I absolutely love their fajita pita wrap! My only complaint is that it's served so hot, I often have to wait a good 5 to 7 minutes to eat it without burning my mouth."}
{"text":"Always the best. Nicky and his boys do Gyros right! Stop and and see the new digs. Oh yeah................ Try a smoothie while you are there.
AWESOME!"}
{"text":"While you're sitting in your car while in the drive-thru at Nick's Gyro in Mentor, Ohio, you can look across the street at the McDonald's, with it's line wrapped around the building at lunch time, and wonder the same thing I did:

Why can't these people drive across the street, get some decent food and help support a local business rather than a fast-food chain they can find anywhere?

Anyone who's lived in Mentor long enough, knows that Nick's occupies what used to be a Burger King, and when they originally opened, the interior looked like one. They have since remodeled, and the new dining area is very modern, comfortable with stools near the window where you can watch the world go by.

The gyro's at Nick's are always generous and the Tzatziki (cucumber) sauce is really good. The ingredients are fresh, the meat tender and flavorful, and there's nothing to complain about the service. I have found that the quality of the gyros can be hit or miss sometimes, but more often I've been pleased than disappointed.

I've not sampled their corned-beef, but was told by one of the owners that it usually out-sells the gyros, so if that floats your boat, give it a try. They also have a large selection of smoothies, fries and other sides.

Nick's is what it is: I really good Gyro place, so if the fast-food feel of the place is a little bit of turn-off, I say give them chance, and be pleasantly surprised.

If I had only one suggestion, it would be that they held, \"I'm drunk and need food\" hours. There are so few places in Mentor open past 2100, they might make a killing selling gyros to idiots like me."}
{"text":"#1 Gyro in the area.  My tip is to try the CUCUMBER SALAD instead of fries !!!!! You won't be disappointed.  Side salad is phenomenal also, all fresh ingredients !!!!!!  Support Local !!!!!  Best Sauce I've ever tried !!"}
{"text":"Clean. Very clean. Large portions. Had the gyro and Cajun fries. Very expensive. The cucumber sauce was bland and disappointing. The food was average at best."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  I can't believe I had never gone here before. I thought they only served gyros but they had the most amazing burger and Greek salad. I'll be back as this is a keeper.  Very clean inside and the people that work there are super friendly."}
{"text":"Great little place- in town for a wedding and had time to eat. Real gyros and really good dressing for the Greek salad. Philly cheesesteak was tasty- everything made fresh to order. Nice people too."}
{"text":"In comparing this establishment, I would like to mention this restaurant to me is similar to a fast food joint. Also, when comparing to most fast food joints, i would give McDonalds, Wendy's, Buger King, or any other large grease-hog a 0/5 star rating. 

So now that you have my base information for evaluation, you can see I enjjoy this place. I do not like giving any fast-food type service a larger than 3 star because I'm very health conscience. So, with that all being said, this is my choice for a fast foo meal. They may not serve romaine in place of letuce, but the customer service is best in my book for a quicky joint. The meatis great, the fries are crispy and the cucumber sauce is outta this world.

I recommend after a long day, a small hangover, or basically anytime you're feeling comfort food."}
{"text":"We eat Greek often, very close to authentic gyros, solid experience from start to finish. Clean place, greeted on entry, owner checked food products as they were coming out, even making sure they were cooked thoroughly.

Service was pretty fast, even with a larger order for our family. All the food came out with great presentation, look very good.

I would say that the food was way better than what I expected. Everyone agreed that it tasted incredible, was good regardless of what we had.

There is no table service, but the staff regularly walked by and was talkative and checking on people. The owner made it a point to make sure that we enjoyed our experience before we left.

You can tell this business is run with a lot of passion and attention, we will absolutely be back and invite our friends."}
{"text":"These are, to be blunt, the best Gyros in the greater Cleveland region. Their burgers, salads, etc., are pretty good as well, but their Gyros us what makes this place so awesome."}
{"text":"Great place, excellent gyros.. Exceptionally clean Second generation business. comfortable dining room and appreciative owners. Great food don't pass this one up."}
{"text":"It was good.  I ate it.  I saw these guys on New Day Cleveland making some chicken, once.  
I'm giving 3 stars because it was pretty good, (not great,) and they didn't correct me when I pronounced it, 
\"year-row\" with extra \"zat-zee-kee.\"  Even my IPhone tried to auto correct me just then. 
I once got in to a fist fight with a guy that served me tzatziki made with mayo.  You might as well pee in my ketchup.  Nick's tzatziki tasted authentic.
The problem I have with their gyro is- it's not right.  The meat is ok, not great but ok.  But the toppings are wrong- the toppings screw it up.  It's like they're trying to make a burger except with lamb meat and pita bread. That's not right.  
Throw some olive oil on the grill, then some pita bread, red onion and Roma tomato.  Leave it all on for a few minutes, slap it together with some tzatziki and your done.  NO shredded lettuce.  NO sliced beefsteak tomato. NO raw white onion.
It's not a burger.  It's a Y E E E E R R O.
If you can't get that right, you can always change your name to Nick's GyWhopperRos."}
{"text":"Complete yumminess! The gyros are the best around. Good food, good service. The onion rings are awesome. We get it to go home because we live close. The food is still very hot and fresh when it hits our table. They use good ingredients."}
{"text":"Can you imagine a delicious flatbread-esque sandwich filled with tender meat, delicious taziki sauce, perfectly sliced tangy onion and hearty not mushy tomato? I hope so because nicks sure delivers! 

Let's face it gyros are hard-to-find and a good gyro is even harder!  I would put nicks gyros up against any other Gyro in the area - and I'm sure they'd win! 

Doesn't matter whether you get it from the restaurant or if you see them at the fair always consistently delicious. 

If you go on Tuesday there by two get one free - Who doesn't love more Gyro Lovins! 

If you don't think you can eat the third one ask them to make it as meat and bread separate - it will make a killer lunch or salad the next day as long as you avoid the dreaded soggy bread apocalypse."}
{"text":"There is none better the Steve's Gyro in the west side market, Nicks is afraid to put meat in the sandwich or sauce they give you a little cup of sauce then charge you for another cup much better places."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some food in Mentor. I have the luxury of going for lunch at work... I order the Fajita Gyro (substitute the meat for Gyro meat), and the cucumber salad as a side. The cucumber salad is all as fresh as can be, and absolutely delicious. 

Highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"Why aren't people lining out the door of this restaurant?! The staff is fantastic. The Gyro and corned beef were amazing. Love going to Mentor because Nicks is there."}
{"text":"Another reviewer referred to Nick's as a \"fast food joint.\"  If the definition of \"fast food\" simply means a place where you walk up to a counter, place your order, then wait for it to be prepared, then OK, it's a fast food joint.  But that's where the similarities end; the food is truly scrumptious and portions are plentiful!

We stopped here while in town for a family member's wedding.  We had arrived a bit early and had some time to kill before being able to check into the hotel, so we decided to get a \"late lunch.\"  I found this restaurant to be nearby our location via my Yelp mobile app, and based on some positive reviews, chose this as a healthier and more suitable option than the standard \"fast food\" fare.

I had the Gyro Meal, a huge and freshly-prepared lamb Gyro, accompanied by a very large Greek salad.  It was mouth-watering good!

So, if you have an appetite for good Mediterranean food, take the time to stop here!"}
{"text":"St. Patty's day is the day we treat ourselves to corned beef sandwiches.  I know everyone raves about Slyman's, but I'm not paying ANYONE 17 bucks for a sandwich.  Especially when I have Nick's right around the corner at 1/2 the price.  It's juicy, a half pound and a great flavor.  Even the rye bread is as fresh as it can be.  I don't know of any other place in Lake County that you'll do any better for corned beef than Nick's."}
{"text":"Delicious gyros!! I ordered a jumbo gyro and it was so much to eat. Mushroom Swiss hamburger was good. Mozzarella cheese sticks were not that good. The place was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Great gyros,cheese steaks corned beef, onion rings great everything.  And...most important, friendly  great  service"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick lunch on a Friday afternoon. I've heard good things about this place and have been meaning to try it. I finally took a dive in after my shopping at Heinens close by. 
There was no one there when I arrived. Good time to take a look at the menu. This is a typical fast food ordering at the register and food served to you when it is ready. I order to go a chicken melt sandwich and a corned beef and Swiss sandwich with a side of onion rings. My food was still hot and fresh when I arrived at home about 25 minutes away.
The chicken was nice and juicy with the melty cheese and buttery toasted bread. I tried a bite of the corned beef. Holy tenderness. Best corned beef in the area!!! Thinly sliced and juicy and tender. Fabulous!
The onion rings were good but nothing to write home about. 
You can combo your sandwich with select sides and a drink for 2.50? I think. My onion rings were like 5 dollars. Corned beef was 9$ and chicken melt was around 7. A little pricey for fast food sandwiches but they are hot and fresh with quality ingredients.
Staff was nice and accommodating to my food requests. Quick and friendly service! 
I plan to be back to try a gyro. Unfortunately they are closed on Sunday's( my day off) but they are open late! Bonus!"}
{"text":"This place is decent. Popped in for lunch and got what they call a Greek pita which is a gyro as far as I can tell. The gyro meat is the shaved kind, not the gross frozen pre-sliced garbage. The sauce is ok, but a bit watery. The portions are ample. Service is friendly enough. Overall, solid, but not amazing food in a community that has limited non-chain food options."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the family once before the renovations and again this week. The dining room is really nice... warm contemporary. The patio area should be a summer draw. 

We ordered three meal combos and our check came to $30. The burgers were large and tasty. The salad was crisp fresh romaine lettuce and toppings. The fries were not that great. They should consider adding fresh cut fries to their menu to do something different than other counter service places around. The smoothie, according to my son the connoisseur, is the best around!

The staff is always welcoming and very friendly. This is a nice option for fast food!"}
{"text":"Nicks is easily the most under rated sandwich  place in Northeast Ohio! 
As a huge Gyro fan I can promise you these are easily the best there is but even is you are not into these tasty Greek pita sandwitches, reach out for the Ruben and hold on for one of the best Rubens you have ever had!
Seriously folks if you drive by this place on Mentor Avenue and don't give it at try you are missing out. Garlic parmesian fries are great, onion rings awesome, and steak sandwiches, burgers and more are all top notch. And, its locally owned by a great family.
Don't take my word for it. Stop in and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about eating here when I first walked in... I wasn't sure I was in the mood for a \"fast food\" burger. But... my family and I gave it a try. MAN!! Am I glad we did! I ordered the gyro burger which consisted of a 1/3 lb burger, topped with gyro meat, and cucumber sauce. It was absolutely amazing! My wife and son were also very pleased with their picks.

Staff was super friendly and made us feel very welcome. We will be back for sure! 

Note: Don't bother paying the extra $1 for the flavored fries. We all ordered the parmesan garlic... Not worth it. However, this did not impact my rating!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We're from the west side of Cleveland but when we come to Mentor we make sure we stop in for food!!!"}
{"text":"Fast food style but with sit down service. Salad and gyros were great. They have great service and really care about the customers. Wish more businesses cared like they do.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not what it once was.  Remodeled for an upscale feel, and the portions have shrunk while the prices have risen.  There are better Gyro options in the area now, which is sad because this was once the best.  Last time, the meat was so greasy that it had to be soaked up with napkins."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Nick's Gyros- and what an awesome business!  They let us know that they were family owned and appreciated our business.  The best customer service I have ever experienced in ANY industry!  And on top of that the dining area was gorgeous and the gyros were delicious.  Disappointed it took us this long to stop in, but we will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely delicious! The workers are very friendly. My favorite meal here is the gyro with fries or the corn beef sandwich. Their food is always very fresh and very hot. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the food is good, but ...

I miss the old Nick's on Vine Street in Eastlake. The chicken pitas in particular were terrific; maybe it was a different grill. The Mentor location is fine, and definitely better than standard fast food. I'd rate their gyros above Best, and on a par or perhaps better than Freshly's.

Odd thing, though, is that I've never seen many people here. Most of the times I've gone there, I've been either the only table or just one of two. It certainly deserves more customers."}
{"text":"Still my favorite gyro spot. Keep up the good work! Consistently good food every time i order."}
{"text":"I went to Nick's Gyros when I was stopped back at home to visit my grandfather and thought I'd give it a whirl.  Needless to say my reaction was, \"Meh, I've had better in Columbus\". Their gyros are a combo between beef and lamb and, I'm sorry, but if I'm going to pay for a gyro, I want all lamb. To me the combo just seems like a cheap-cop-out. Their salad I got with my meal was nice and fresh - no fugly lettuce leaves and such so that was good. Overall, if I was REALLY craving a gyro and had no where else to go - maybe I'd go back but honestly wasn't impressed despite the workers being very nice people."}
