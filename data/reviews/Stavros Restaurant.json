{"text":"This place is  a dive. Do yourself a  favour  and stay away,The place is now called Pete's Corner Grill and from my experience there I understand completely why they had to change their name. There is no atmosphere to speak of whatsoever other than dull,boring and indifferent. The owners of this so called eatery work behind the grill and look like they've been working far too long as both couldn't care less when it comes to decent customer service. My brother ordered onion rings that took too long to arrive and when they did they were burnt to a crisp. My brother didn't want to be  a bother so he didn't complain right away as he should have but at the end of the meal when the waitress asked us how everything was I let her know. She was understanding and friendly and said she would let the owner know and see what he could do. The owner's response was basically, \"too bad\" and he was also giving this poor girl an earful too while he was giving us the dupe. Believe me, this place is not worth your time."}
{"text":"Out of many, one of my favourite here would be none other than 'Club House Sandwich' with house special cooked fries.   I might be able to consider myself bit of a regular here mostly for brunch or breakfast as the place is bright and it doesn't take long to grab a fork and knife. In other words, the service is quite quick and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Consistently good service, cheap food. This is a favourite for breakfast and even though it's officially called Parkdales Pete's Corner Grill (yeah... no apostrophe on \"Parkdales\") I'm always going to call it Stavros. The breakfast specials are great value and I love that they have rye toast! Greasy diner food, perfect hangover cure or lazy Saturday solution."}
{"text":"Every now and then I have a craving for cheap greasy food at a place sans one of those fancy preparations and servers with fake smiles. This establishment has been here for a while (very obvious by the signage) and intends to be here for a while, i am sure. Attracting a mix of Parkdale crowd - hipsters with eastern europeans with almost-homeless folks - this is certainly an interesting restaurant to visit.   FYI, huge portions of cheap and greasy food gets washed down easily with coffee that has been sitting in the pot for a while. ;-)"}
{"text":"I visited Stavros' today and I tried their chicken souvlaki on Greek salad. The chicken was moist and tender, the salad was fresh with a nice blend of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sweet peppers and olives. The house made salad dressing was excellent and the house made tzatziki sauce was a nice complement to the chicken. The service was friendly without being intrusive - Matt and Carol were attentive and welcoming. Will definitely go back again and bring my family and friends here!"}
{"text":"Slow, indifferent service, boring decor and a faint disinfectant smell.  The standard breakfasts were average.    Put it all together and you get 2 stars."}
{"text":"Meh, meh meh.  Although my good friend lives down the street and in the mornings not wanting to go anywhere we usually order to go from there, it actually kind of sucks.  I ALWAYS ask for no butter on my toast as they use margarine or something cheap and gross.  I ALWAYS aks for no mayo on anything and apply the real stuff at home.  That said and done, they just replaced their big sign outside to read Pete's Corner Grill I dont care. I dont care about the change it's the same staff with their blank stares  and basic English."}
{"text":"- Clean restaurant - Good food - Great prices - Nice service  Great place for breakfast! I recommend:  - Greek omelette with home fries, toast and coffee. ($9) and  - Saussages, scrambled eggs, toast and coffee ($9)"}
{"text":"Not the prettiest restaurant, but the service was great and the food very good. The prices are not as cheap as you'd expect given the location and decor, but the serving size was huge and food was tasty. I'll go back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Sometimes breakfast is a fancy affair, such as a posh brunch with witty friends. Other times it needs to be fast, tasty and reasonably priced, such as the greasy spoon fare shared the morning after with the hookup form the night before. Stavros is the best in TO for the latter.  The staff is friendly and the food is classic, cheap and very tasty! The Parkdale locale insures a colourful atmosphere. Their eggs benny is one of the best I've had in the city. The only thing I could ask for would be a better tasting coffee; theirs is okay, but nothing special.  Tip - If ordering the steak and eggs ask first to make sure the charcoal grill is on for that BBQ taste!"}
{"text":"I like places like this in the summer. Doors are open and there is a breeze on a warm day.  The food wasn't top notch but it was good, service was great and the return on your money is amazing. I got a solid full meal for under $15 and a drink included. I love the area because it wasn't packed around dinner time and it was a really great experience there.  If I was in there area then I'd definitely be a regular there.  This place is definitely Isaac Recommended."}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is the servers.  They have always been kind, polite and very accommodating  I wish that their service would transcend into the food they provide.  At this point I have eaten the lamb gyro, beef burger, eggs Benedict and fries with gravy.  Perhaps I have unusually high standards.  The lamb gyro was reasonably good and I won't complain about that or the fries with gravy.  Although the beef burger tasted and looked like something that came out of a box, and the hollindaise sauce on my eggs Benedict tasted as if it was drowned in mayonnaise.  Now I do understand different restaurants have different takes on hollindaise sauce sometimes making it their own, but as a person who makes her own it first off didn't have the appearance of a hollindaise sauce and if I wanted something that tasted like mayonnaise I would have asked the server for a bottle and smeared it on myself.  I guess I'm just more used to that buttery hollindaise sauce taste that no one messes with even when they do their own take on it.    As for decor its plain and simple.  There is more than enough setting and it's very much got the family owned and run kind of feel to it.    Prices are reasonable but to me it wasn't worth it to have reasonable prices to a meal that I didn't enjoy very much, unfortunately.  Kudos to the servers for being so bright and cheery."}
