{"text":"Morrison Healthcare Food Services has been relentless in their effort to milk every choice-less patient and visitor to Sunnybrook with their over-priced, mediocre food services.   Harlequin's is one the better cafeterias run by Morrison at Sunnybrook. And here you do have choice! Of course not when it comes to prices as everything is equally overpriced, but you get to choose between Pizza Pizza, Teriaki, a sandwich place, and a place run directly by Morrison that serves hamburgers and all things deep fried.   I've got to admit that I do enjoy the ambiance of Halequin's. Harlequin's, with Its brightly coloured walls and glass ceiling, is designed to make you forget that you're in a hospital (well, only if you turn a blind eye to the presence of doctors and nurses I guess).  Bottom line, this place is A-OK. But the food prices are ridiculous. If you get hungry, the corner of Bayview and Eglinton (about 5 min drive from Sunnybrook) will provide you with pretty much whatever you want and you get to keep both of your arms and legs!

{"text":"This is the most horrible Second Cup location That I have ever been to. They do not allow you to collect Second Cup Rewards , They do not participate in any of the specials that the Second Cup offers, they do not allow you to use Second Cup points , And they do not even have stoppers for their coffee cups. Useless place!"}

{"text":"This is a food court I've even to countless times and I have tried food from the main vendors. Here's what I have to say for them:  Pizza Pizza is the cheapest option for lunch, and they offer lasagna with garlic breadsticks as well which is good for a change.  Swiss Chalet here is the basic barebones of what a Swiss Chalet normally offers at their restaurant. Just chicken is  on the  menu, so don't get too excited about ordering anything like ribs etc.   I used to love to go to the Extreme Pita here since I like the healthier option of pita wrap over the Pizza Pizza or Swiss Chalet. One particular experience changed it forever. I was standing in line when the server that was making my pita got called to the back by her coworker. From where I was standing I saw my server go to the back and touch another non-food prepping surface before coming back. She did not remove the gloves that she had while making my pita. When she came back I interrupted her as I saw her hands were going straight for my half wrapped pita. I had to ask her \"could you change your gloves please?\" She did what I asked her to do with an offended air to her. I didn't care. In my mind I was thinking of the cleanliness of my food from all the previous times that I ate here! After this encounter I've never had one of their wrapped pitas again. I still see that same server wrapping pitas and I can only hope that she's gotten better with her hand hygiene and food safety regimen. Afterall this is a food court at a hospital. I would hate for any visitors and staff to get food related illness from unclean food prepping procedure.  If you really want to have a pita still, I suggest for an extra dollar you order the entree version of their pitas because the servers just have to put all the ingredients in a bowl for you and put pita on the side. It limits the chance of potential unclean hands or gloves touching your food and I'm sure we can all feel a little safer this way."}
{"text":"food 3*, management 0* 1.5 stars. I've had the pleasure of visiting more than my fare share of hospital cafeterias and this one is probably one of the worst ones so far.  The only food option I would go for is the self serve Pizza, other food options don't really excite the taste buds. The hot food counter which usually offers either salmon, minuscule portions of fajita or some form of Indian food is quite overpriced. The swiss Chalet option is nothing you haven't experienced before, and during your time there you will realize they will try to do everything to charge you for anything! Getting a bagel?! The little packaged jams/PB will cost ~30-60c a piece! What really took the cake though was when they removed the water tap (the only working one in this area of the hospital) and suggested patrons either buy water or get it in the w/c!! That's just indecent."}
{"text":"So im sitting in the cafeteria now. I got a pita for extreme pita.. food great but the girl making it was so freaking miserable!  I almost told her to stuff it and walk away."}
