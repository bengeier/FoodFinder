{"text":"Ok, I understand that House of Chan has been a staple in this neighborhood for quite some time but given the selection of steakhouses in Toronto this place is so overrated! 

First thing, the decor.  It does not resemble what it should look like given the prices that you pay and is in true need of renovation.  It reminds me of those Chinese restaurants that catered to Caucasians in the 80's.  My expectations is that a restaurant that has so much business could at least afford to make the place look half decent.  It's like they don't care.  The owner is probably cheap.    

I ordered the rib-eye and although it was not bad there's was no 'wow' factor, or rather, at least not to the point that would warrant it being called one of the best steakhouses.  My steak was literally served on a white plate, plain with no garnishes. Looked like something that I would make at home.  Prior to them bringing out the steak they brought out vegetables.  Now here is hilarious part.  Imagine raw vegetables barely cut and put on a plate.  It's like they went to Sobey's, washed them and voila, dinner is served.  

Good food but it is definitely not the best.  When I pay high prices I expect good food, ambiance, presentation and service.  House of Chan only has good food and the food is not even good enough to offset what it does not have.  Maybe I'm just picky...

Would I recommend, yes, if you are a restaurateur but if it is a rare occurrence to treat yourself to decent steaks outside of The Keg price range (albeit the steaks here do taste better than the Keg) then there are plenty of better steakhouses out there!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing about House of Chan for a while, it had quite a rep as being a great place.   Being christmas eve, it was a good time to go test it out.  

The staff was friendly, showing us to a very red booth.  So far so good.  My boyfriend's menu was filthy, he requested a new one.  The options seemed to be either steak (which was pretty expensive), or chinese food.  The options were pretty basic.  

First course: Wonton soup, which I thought was decent.  
We split a vegetarian egg roll which was unremarkable
A friend got their fried potatoes/onions, the potatoes were pretty good. 

On the menu, the Oriental style filet mignon was highlighted as being a house specialty and our waiter said it was very good.  We also ordered a vegetable chow mein, and a chicken cashew dynamite style.  

The oriental style filet mignon was a small quantity of filet mixed with some snow peas and broccoli, with a soy sauce.  In quality and quantity it was very disappointing, and for the $42 price it was an insulting dish, we sent it back and to the restaurant's credit at least they didn't charge us for it.  

The chicken cashew dynamite was OK, but not much better than some breaded chicken with sweet tangy sauce that you'd get from a mall food court fake chinese restaurant.  At $19, it was ridiculous.  

In summary, the food was unremarkable and the prices sky high.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"Came here with 11 others for a friend's birthday after doing some Internet searching for steakhouses. At first glance, this didn't seem like a steakhouse at all, but one of those Chinese-American restaurants you see in movies/TV. We arrived at about 6:30 on a Saturday, and there wasn't any problem getting a table, despite the restaurant's no-reservations policy. Closer to the end of our meal, there was a pretty large crowd waiting for tables.

A lot of of us ordered the prime rib steak at the recommendation of the friendly waiter - and it turned out to be a great recommendation. The beef had great flavour and texture with the bone-in. The steaks come with a side of fried onions and potatoes, which were filling, but the onions especially took away from the flavour of the steak. 

I'd definitely recommend the great food and service at House of Chan. I didn't get a chance to try the lobster tails, but that's definitely on the list for next time!"}
{"text":"When you sit down at this place, you feel like you're in a darker version of the Chinese restaurant in Bruce Lee's \"Return of the Dragon\"!!  Ambiance is cheesy, and they do sell the typical Chinese food you find at any Chinese place catering to North American tastes.

Those in the know, however, understand what this place REALLY is - one of the best steakhouses in the GTA (arguably the best, although the ambiance, for me, keeps it from getting the 5th star).  Nothing but USDA Prime cuts here, folks, and priced accordingly.  My personal favourite is the ($49.95) Prime Rib Eye (King) steak, a 16 oz. slab of beef goodness!!  Pair it with a Beringer's Knights Valley Cab and you're good to go!!

The sides are really just an extension of the cheesiness of the whole ambiance - sliced tomatoes and onions, for instance.  I do find myself gorging on the crispy egg noodles, dipping them in the hot mustard sauce while waiting for the steak.

If you order lobster, and if you want to be adventurous, ask the waiter for the \"Goh\" (pronounced \"Go\").  This is the lobster brain that is usually just thrown away (or probably taken home by the Chinese wait staff).  It's not on the menu, but you can order some fried noodles and mix it up with it.  It is cholesterol city, but it's so RICH and delicious when paired with the noodles!!!

If you love a fantastic steak, and want to see what else is out there besides the Keg and Canyon Creek, make House of Chan one of your stops.

Eat here while it's still around.  Sadly, it is scheduled to be demolished to make way for subway expansion.  Hopefully they pop-up at a new location."}
{"text":"I come here for good steak, potatoes, and fried onions.  And the stone crab claws when they are available.  I don't come here for Chinese food. Steak and stone crab claws!  Like Chris Tucker said in Rush Hour \"Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?!\""}
{"text":"This place is a scam. Yes the steaks are good, but INSANELY overpriced. If you have basic knowledge of cookery you can get one from Cumbraes for a fraction of the price and cook it yourself with the same results. There are plenty of places with comparable steaks for 1/2 or 1/3 of the price.

But the worst part is the \"Chinese food.\"

This is the biggest scam. This is fucking dog food. You can get American Chinese. across the street At Spring China for 1/5 of the price and it is miles better. 

The worst Chinese food in Chinatown is way better and costs nothing. No Chinese people eat here, for a reason.

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Dark, musty, sexy and surreal. Okay, yes, they do serve Chinese food, but forgettaboutit, go for the steak. This steak house may not look the part from the exterior, but make no mistake, it is. Steak rule 3: if it smells like a steak house, it is a steak house.  

For the past five decades, House of Chan has been a coveted Toronto keepsake to famous folk and ordinary steak connoisseurs like me.

Expect to drop an arm (and perhaps half a leg), but it's worth it. The Ã  la carte menu may be daunting so allow me to break it down.  Two people, one steak, one lobster, two sides.  Perfection. 

The owner is a charming and engaging man who loves to name-drop, but I suppose he can, since he's dropping some big names. I'm sure that their Chinese offerings (like the egg foo yong, a childhood favourite) are equally delicious, but when I think Chinese food, I like to go for \"fye dollar fly rice\".

I love steak."}
{"text":"Want a good steak and fresh (live, not frozen tails) lobster, with some Canadian-Chinese staples like egg foo yong and lemon chicken all in the same meal? --- this is the place for you. 

A high-end steak and lobster restaurant that has the name, look, and the feel of a kitschy Canadian-Chinese eatery. Weird combination, but it seems to work as the place has been around for a long time and is often packed. 

Awesome steaks. 

Okay Chinese food but you can get them in a real Chinese restaurant for a lot loss. 

Very good service, now that's one thing you normally don't get in Chinese restaurants. 

Why go to Morton's or Ruth's Chris when you can have a much more interesting experience in House of Chan?"}
{"text":"From the outside this restaurant looks like a nasty Canadian-Chinese restaurant, try-harder, wanna-be.. I say this as an Asian person myself. Decked out in red with over the top Chinese vibe going on, I was a little worried. 

At a friends' suggestion, I went here for my mom's b-day. Apparently they have one of the best steaks in Toronto. The inside is pretty cozy and it was busy, like packed busy, I gained more confidence.  

A good feature about this place is that they give free snacks to nibble on. Deep fried chow mein sticks, they are goooodddd and addictive. My mom ordered the steak and she did seem to enjoy it. Me being a vegetarian, I ordered the chow mein... Typical Ho Lee Chow style noodles, not the greatest but A-OK. 

My mom loved the steak, her verdict: the best she ever had. For the price, I would expect nothing less."}
{"text":"Rip Off Alert!!

I should have known this when I walked in.

Still feeling scammed 24hrs later.

The prices here are ridiculous for such a dump.

We ordered:

2 soups
1 steak
1 beef & broccoli dish
2 soft drinks

$155

Yes.  one hundred and fifty five.

You can go to Barbour Sixty in Toronto and get s way better meal with ambiance for cheaper

Please do not waste your money here.

If you want Chinese, a short drive to Spadina/Dundas area will get you amazing Chinese food at $8/plate.  

And to summarize, the food was not good at all.

What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"What ever you do DO NOT order the Chinise food.

This is actually a cult resturant of 50 years very expensive with good steaks and lobster owned by a non Chinise family there has never been anyone Chinese involved in ownership.

Stick to steaks lobster and red wine be prepared to pay huge"}
{"text":"When you first see this place, you sort of question why people love it. Decorated with the cheesy, typical Chinese writing stating \"House of Chan\" with a red flashing light, you just can't help thinking this place is sketchy. You walk in, waiters are dressed in the typical tie and vest. Place is painted red with a few touches of Asian images and typical bamboo. It's also quite small. However, if you order this steak - you won't be disappointed. I don't eat steak myself, but my friends who are absolute steak-lovers said it was amazing. I ordered the lobster & shrimp dish and thoroughly enjoyed it. Service was impeccable too."}
{"text":"I'd give the steaks 4 stars but the ridiculously high prices for what you get caused me to knock off one star. If you think about Canadian Chinese food from the 1970's combined with fancy 1970's style steak set in 1970's decor but priced for forty years later, this is what you'll get."}
{"text":"This is a pricey but good quality Chinese restaurant very popular with the local Jewish community - so much so that the staff could advise me on what's pareve (I'm not Jewish, but I am allergic to dairy) It's a fun and interesting crowd and the place was packed when I went, which was a Tuesday night.

I had the Singapore noodles which were pretty average, but my friend had the shrimp in lobster sauce which was pretty spectacular. We shared a sliced pork appetizer which was simple but delicious. He's had the steak before and said it's one of the best at prices comparable to The Keg.

All in all - expensive, but, for steak and seafood it seems to be a solid choice."}
