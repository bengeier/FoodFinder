{"text":"Went in on a friday night, we were seated in a far corner away from everyone else, our waitress kept forgetting about us, didn't want to get us refills, my husbands limeade was nasty, and we could see our food sitting in window for the longest time, with so many other restaurants in the area, we won't go back"}
{"text":"My review is for the wedding services they provide.  When my now-husband and I found out that we could get married at Denny's we decided that we had to do it.  I received excellent service once I was put in touch with Sheila, the manager.  She explained to me what I options I could choose from and we went from there.  In the beginning, we had chosen the cheapest option, but we were upgraded because we had a special guest musician perform for us.  The upgrades were great!  The flower bouquet and boutonniere was so pretty!!!  The cake pops were delicious and the set up looked great!  We had also wanted an Elvis minister, so they put us in touch with one and he was fantastic!!  I would definitely recommend getting married at Denny's if you are thinking about getting married in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I just got here after trying to get dinner at my mother's and they were supposed to be open until 10 and they couldn't turn off the open sign fast enough so I came here   the food was good close to my house and not expensive"}
{"text":"Like another person said, this place is a hit or miss. The last time I went there, I waited 30 minutes on my food with 10 people in the place. I got the grand slam which comes with coffee and choice of juice. I said I wanted orange juice for my juice. I never received my coffee and when I asked about it, the waitress said she thought I only wanted OJ since I didn't ask for coffee. You would think that it was implied that I wanted coffee. Do I have to ask for every thing? Do I ask for hash browns when it says it comes with it? There is a problem every other time I go in this Dennys. I've had sausage that was frozen inside. I gave it 3 stars for the times that the service was good. I've been coming to this location for about 3 years and I've seen a decline in service."}
{"text":"RUDE. SKIP THIS PLACE. I've tried to call in togo food 3+ times (separate times). They never pick up! EVER!! Their phone may as well be disconnected."}
{"text":"Foods decent. But they had us wait for a good 15 minutes before we even got our food. And their freezer broke and could've advised people that they did my have \"breaded\" things. Half our meal was \"breaded\" things and Our server was Vanessa"}
{"text":"I'm not writing this all over again after yelp dropped the first send of the post, but to make a long story short the customer service was the worst. Downright rude and deliberately inattentive.  Same with the Ft. Apache and Tropicana location. I will never step foot in another Denny's again and I will be contacting the corporate office.  I wish I had on a hidden camera so you could see them ignoring us!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. You don't expect much when you go to a Denny's but you do expect not to have to wait over 45 mins for food to arrive. Went on a Saturday for dinner and left without because service was so slow. Server says, you're fine to go. No kidding. We'll never be back to this hole."}
{"text":"Aka Denny's Dogfood. This is the worst place I've had breakfast, had to wait and ask for service, the dishes were so old they were stained and chipped, I had a dirty fork at my table, parking was a challenge, the menu selection wasn't very good. Once was enough."}
{"text":"I gave this denny's a five for a few reasons.   1- This dennys is walking distance from CSN making it convenient to go to.  2- The free wifi it helps when I am hungry and need to do work on the computer to do it right there and the food is moderately priced.  3- the service is amazing. the staff members are always checking up on you to ensure that everthing is to your satisfaction.  4- The food is always so good like the saying goes \"you get what you pay for\" here you pay and you get good quality food."}
{"text":"We have at good quality food and drinks on time we make this restaurant from now are home! Hugo he is the manager on duty and the Jesus (server) great team work. Clean restaurant good place to eat."}
{"text":"Got to say the worst Denny's I ever had been to, we simply came in to grab some fries, the food was done and the only two worker who is working here took a break/went outside at the same time while the food is siting cold.   Not recommended, very disappointed at the night shift worker and my visit here. They also didn't care to clean to tables or even pick up the plates. I don't know about other shift but the night shift had a very poor costumer service"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst Denny's I have ever been to, and I don't expect a lot when I go to a Denny's.  What I do expect from a Denny's: -Being greeted and/or seated within 20 minutes -A smile from at least one employee -Tables that aren't filthy -Being given silverware -Beverages within 15 minutes of being seated -Cups/glasses that do not have lipstick on them -Menus -Coffee that is hot when served -Having my order taken within 45 minutes of entering  Congrats! You met zero out nine standards!"}
{"text":"The Denny's at this location has outstanding cooks. Everything is always nicely cooked and hot, I love the skillets. The problem is with the service, the only consistancy is that it is terrible. My observation is not on one experience or two, it is the last four out of the last five times we have been there, no coffee refills, no to go boxes, we waited and waited for ANY service to the point the server in the next section finally helped us. Management needs step up the service."}
{"text":"While the waitress was very sweet and friendly, itt was 30-40 minutes before the food arrived. There is also a random character at the counter starring at people, making things a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The absolute worst Denny's in America. Waited an hour and a half for food that never came so ONCE AGAIN got up and left and the so called manager told the server well there's nothing we can do about it. I have an idea get out your damn office and help u sorry ass! Now I know why they have so much trouble keeping this place staffed. Managers don't care and seem content with losing customers and collecting a paycheck. No urgency at all. Cook doesn't care but why should he if his manager doesn't either. Feel bad for the server who has NO CHANCE at all to even get his tips."}
{"text":"They had a bunch of tables open and never used them. So many people had to wait to be seated. We waited 10 minutes, 5 minutes for someone to ask us about drinks and we ordered at the same time. Took 40 minutes to get out food and there was no apology for the wait. They weren't even busy just slow workers and cooks. Won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"Denny's right now is probably one of my favorite places to go for good food at reasonable prices. Fast and friendly service with consistently good food. The best part about Denny's they are open 24 hours a day and you can order breakfast, lunch and dinner anytime you want."}
{"text":"Once went there with another adult and 7 kids. The nice hostess elderly lady extended \"kids eat free\" night to all of them... Not just the normal 2 per adult. Very nice and fast service!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs.  Service sucks. Not only was my waitress inattentive the entire time, she decides to disrespect me at the end of my meal.  Food was mediocre at best. Extremely greasy and I found hair in my fruit bowl.  Will NEVER come here again  If I could give no stars I would!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great, young and apologetic... but the food was terrible. The manager was cooking and waving her spatula all over the place with a sour expression and people waiting forever for terrible food... I received Burnt Hash Browns, and what they have done to the 'Moons over My Hammy\" breakfast sandwich is just down right deplorable. It was our favorite sandwich for years and although it has been shrinking in size, tonight we had to open the sandwich to find the Ham.... and we were not even sure it was real ham... Sad that we have to say goodbye to such a wonderful meal.. Thanks but no thanks... we will find a new place to visit for a tasty dinner"}
{"text":"By far the most modern and nicest Denny's ever!!! Recommended highly! The staff is very nice and the manager was out walking around checking on guests! It is a great change to all the overpriced restaurants in this area!"}
{"text":"There was a problem with communication between the waitress and the cook. My lady ordered a skillet with no onions and she got one full of onions.  She had to wait like, 20 mins to get the order right. Then, we called the manager over and he apologized and offer free french toast. I think her meal should have been free. I was almost finished with my meal when she started. It was not a.good experience At least my meal was good. The peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes were excellent."}
{"text":"This Denny's has done a total 180. The food is on point, the service is awesome, and they answer the phones now so we can do take out  orders. Love it!! Will continue to come back and recommend this location now. Thank you guys, and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Went in for a meeting this morning. Great food and drinks. The server was excellent coming in to refill drinks but not bugging us."}
{"text":"Had an excellent burger with jalape√±o bacon. Yummy!!! Server was very friendly so was the manager. Also had the tater tots with sour cream."}
{"text":"Had the Banana Cream Breakfast. Super scrumptious pancakes. Ashley J was a fabulous server and kept my coffee full."}
{"text":"I was @ the dennys on Tyvola Rd on 9/27/14 around 11:50am   The restaurant was not full at all but I had to wait 10 minutes which I was ok with. It was a friend of mine, his neece(4 year old), my son (8 year old) and my self. After we sat down we waited ten minutes before we were asked by our waitress what would we like to drink, which we went ahead and told her the drinks we would like along with the food order since we already had enough time to look at the menu since we were not approached for 10 minutes and also we had 2 small kids that needed to be fed. The waitress left and a few minutes later she brought the drinks. We waited 1 hour and 10 minutes minutes from the time of the drinks before we asked her , about the food. Within that time that we waited we heard yelling coming from the kitchen and screaming from the lady that we later knew it was the manager. She was yelling at the employees and saying things like \"move your ass\" ,\"get this plate out of here now\" she was rude to her employees and was not professional to maintain certain conversations from being heard by the customers . We just wanted to eat, so we didnt pay attention to the yelling that much. When we asked the waitress about the food, She politely said that it was coming, I personally dont think it was her fault at all, it was more the kitchen and the manager on duty. The waitress said it was coming and went to the kitchen to check upon the order, we also heard her say to the kitchen crew \"why is table 22's ticket not on the screen\", she was arguing with the kitchen crew and they replied that maybe it had \"Expired\". We asked another waitress for our table number and she said it was 22, so we quickly realized that it was our ticket and food that was missing and thats why we never received the food, we call the waitress and ask her to please explain what was going on, she said that the ticket was not on file but that they were going to make it right away, which I replied politely to speak to the manager. I just wanted an explanation since the restaurant was not even full, and i saw employess just walking around. When the manager came to our table (she is Caucasian) all I said was that \"I been waiting for more than an hour with 2 small kids that need to be fed, I told her that I didnt understand why it was taking so long to make our food, she replied and said I dont really know whats going on, or what happened, all I can tell you is that it seems like your order got lost, I was really dissapointed by this time that all I said is I would like the total for my drinks and that way I can go somewhere else\", and her reply was \"its nothing, good bye! and yelled to the kitchen STOP making the FOOD!. She never apologize or never even cared to try to find a appropriate explanation. When we got up and were walking out and the table behind us, said that the waiting time was ridiculous, and that they waited about the same. The table across us, a family with 4 small kids also got up and left when we left.   I rarely write reviews, but I think this experience has been one of the worst Ive been in so it deserves to be shared and maybe they can fix whatever they are lacking in. This store just opened for more than 6 months, and should not be having this kinds of problems. They need better managing skills, someone who is professional and someone who at least cares for costumer service when its needed."}
{"text":"We had a party of eight on the 27th of July. It was well over 80 degF in the dining area where we were located. The entire party complained they were hot and two in our party ended up with migraine headaches. I asked for the manager who acknowledged there was a problem with the A/C. When I asked if contacting corporate would help expedite correcting the problem, he advised \"it might\". I don't know about anyone else out there but I don't appreciate paying over $100 for a meal to have 2 out of 8 in our party needing to medicate themselves because of migraines induced by the excessive heat in the dining area."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Denny's in other states before, and when this one opened in Arizona we thought it would be good. The restaurant is brand new and very nice - however - the food portions and quality were very bad. My husband's eggs were burned and had to send them back. We asked for butter not margarine and we got margarine slathered on our toast. Also, when we asked to speak to the manager they said that \"these are the portions\" and apologized for the burned breakfast skillet. Disappointed. Net-net: Go to the IHOP or Village Inn if you really want a great quality breakfast :("}
{"text":"Extremely poor service!!! We came in and waited a few minutes for waitress to attend us for our drinks. We then ordered right away and after 15 minutes of waiting we still didn't have our meals. We asked why our salad and two lettuce wrapped burgers were not ready yet.. Waitress said a worker from the kitchen left because they had a emotionally meltdown.. Few minutes later we waited and food finally arrived. I was missing my side of broccoli . We got that a couple minutes later. Then we ordered zucchini fries, and here I am still waiting for my fries after 30 minutes of waiting.."}
{"text":"4.5/5! Cause there's always room for improvement right? Totally kidding, I literally just hate that I can never finish the food here LOL  Denny's is a key place for us to go when we have family from overseas. It's almost become a ritual to bring every visitor to try out this modernized diner. We went around midnight and were seated right away and it took about 5-10 minutes for the waitress to come to our table. Usually I would be pretty upset about this but it was only one waitress responsible for our whole side; it wasn't quiet either, it was pretty crowded for how late it was. Regardless, our waitress was awesome; super friendly, cheery, and extremely efficient. She took our drink and food orders together and it arrived within 10 minutes. We all ordered a breakfast pancake platter: blueberry pancake breakfast, peanut butter cup pancake breakfast (new!), and cinnamon pancake breakfast (new!). I was told the cinnamon pancake tasted like a cinnamon roll!  All plates come with two eggs (can be switched to egg whites), their delicious hash browns, and bacon or sausage (or both!). We all decided to get turkey bacon. From all of us, the food was delicious. Every table has salt and pepper, ketchup, strawberry and orange jams, sugars and sweeteners, etc. The eggs, bacon, and hash browns come on one plate and the pancakes come on another. Naturally, you can understand why I can't ever finish their food. One of us finished their whole two plates but the rest left a bit of each. You know when you're so full but the food is way too good for you to stop but you know it's not a good idea to continue for the sake of your stomach's sanity? Yeah, that's a Denny's visit for me.   They also have free wi-fi! It was a little humid inside but it wasn't unbearable. All three orders put together came up to about $33 which I think is pretty reasonable considering the quality and quantity of the food you're served. Denny's is always a recommend :) enjoy!"}
{"text":"My experience was awful! I came in around 3 am to place a to go order. The staff wasn't very friendly at all, which is understandable. Who would be in a good mood serving drunk people in the middle of the night? I ordered a Grand Slamwich without ham or maple spread, with fries & a side of ranch. I payed for my food and waited. After 45 minutes of waiting I asked it my food was ready? I was going to cancel and just go home hungry, because waiting almost an hour for an egg sandwich and fries seemed absolutely ridiculous. Especially, considering that they weren't very busy. The lady said sorry and went to check on my food. She said they were boxing it up. She brought it to me shortly after. When I got in the car I checked my food. I had cold hard fries and no ranch. I just took the loss. I wasn't going to spend anymore of my time there. If I had went back for fresh fries I would've probably been there another 30 m minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. I honestly didn't expect such great service from Denny's. It was very busy but the wait was only 15 for 2 at 11:30am on a Saturday. Waiter and staff where very helpful. Staff was quick to fix any issues we had (missing utensils and water refill)"}
{"text":"This place used to be good. They need better cooks who are consistent and who know how to make eggs. The bacon here is awful. They do not cook the bacon to order. They cook a batch and let it sit until who knows when. When you ask for bacon to be cooked fresh they never cook it fresh they end up giving you the bacon that has been sitting the longest."}
{"text":"Decent place. The guy at the front desk was nice. He went several times to check on the to-go order that took about a half hour to arrive.  The food was good, too."}
{"text":"The only thing I recommend is the burgers. The burgers are so good. But they can go cheap with the fries and it can get annoying. The waiters are nice sometimes it takes a little bit to cook the burgers and it depends on the day you go on and what time of day."}
{"text":"Was on vacation in Az this past weekend, enjoyed our stop here with the family. The staff are super nice & the banana splits are out of this world.. yummyl"}
{"text":"Food here is ok but overpriced.  Server asks for our drink order and my wife and I ordered apple juice as it was breakfast time.  Our drinks were brought out immediately and the food 20 minutes later.  While we sat of course we sipped and by the time the food arrived my juice was gone.  I asked for a refill to which I was then told oh no refills on that.  1. How do you bring me a drink 20 minutes before my food and then tell me no refills?  2.  Is there a juice shortage?  It's not expensive for juice quit being greedy.  And 3.  If there are no refills tell us, up front and ask if we want something else or juice when the meal comes.  Very shady and I will not be coming here again"}
{"text":"Excellent Denny's. Bathroom was very clean. Service good and food pretty good. The scrambled eggs weren't as good as usual but the pancakes were excellent. Good size portions. Sausage and hash browns were good. I'll have to remember this place next time I'm near Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Denny's in a while and now I remember why. The only reason I went is because I had a free birthday coupon. The service was pretty good but I went at 7 AM and there was hardly anyone there. The food was not very good so I'm glad I got it for free because I would not have been very happy to pay for the meal I received."}
{"text":"Reviewed Dish:  Fish & Chips, Hot Turkey Dipper (Sandwich), Double Cheese Burger  Reviewed during: Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 3.5 / 5 Cooking speed: 3.5 / 5 Food Quality: 3.5 / 5 Food Quantity: 2 / 5 Price: 3 / 5  Cleanness: / 5  Repeat: No  The speed was not too bad considering it was a Fri lunch during shopping season.  We tried a few dishes in the same sitting, the Double Cheese Burger is decent, but only a very small amount of hash brown came with the dish. It's the same with the Hot Turkey Dipper, there's only a little of stuffing as well. The Fish and chip got a decent amount of fries, and the fish is the right portion, the crust is quite crispy.  After the meal, we looked at other tables, they easily got more than double amount of hashbrown & stuffing! It is unfortunate the quality is not consistent."}
{"text":"The restaurant is dirty and smells of old food.  We were sat down to a table that was sticky and given menus that had food stains on it.  It was 90 degrees outside and inside the restaurant wasnt much cooler.  We sat for a few minutes and looked around at the lack of other customers and left.    Will not be going back to this location until they do some house cleaning."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. It can be busy and other days not as much. Luckily we went on a day it wasn't too busy or crowded. We were seated quickly and the waitress was very nice. Food tasted good and the place was clean. It's right next to a Starbucks and La Quinta Inn. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"This place was TERRIBLE!!!!! They did not serve us because they did not have \"clean dishes\". I have NEVER heard of that in my life. Denny's is TERIIBLE!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!  If I could give ZERO STARS, I would!!!!"}
{"text":"Location is easy to find, taste is good, the price is reasonable, a lot of food choices."}
{"text":"I came here when it first was built and the service then was fair. The last several experiences at this establishment have been disappointing at best. I came here over and over hoping it would change, but it hasn't. I ordered bisucits and gravy, and it was cold by the time it got to my table. The wait time is ridiculous and the waiters do not attend to the customer like they should. The building is nice and the place is generally clean. The problem here is management. All it will take is for a new group of people to run this place and get it up to par. I've ate at 100's of Denny's in my time (especially when on road trips) and the experience here does not represent Denny's. Hopefully someone from corporate will see this and swoop in to save this place. I'll come back and try them again in three months. I really hope this place gets better, because its so close to me."}
{"text":"Acarei rude employee at Denny's  I called dennys at 3:07 this morning and Acarei took my order, 3 moons over my hammy, egg whites, turkey instead of ham, no cheese on one, add avocado and mushrooms to all sandwiches, HASHBROWNS for all and 2 orders of fruit. She asked if I'd been to this dennys before because they don't have mushrooms at this dennys, I said yes you do, I always order from this location with Joe and ruby I'm a regular here. She states she's been working here for 7 months and doesn't think they have mushrooms, then she states she cannot find the mushroom add on button. She finally finds it.... I arrive at the restaurant, My food finally comes out after 20 minutes. I always double check my food, there was no egg whites on any of the sandwiches, and no avocado! The girl proceeded to roll her eyes at me and take the food and slam it into the garbage! I asked for a refund when I witnessed her horrible attitude! I worked all day and just finished moving, I don't need attitude from anyone who's helping prepare my food. This person had no idea how to do a CASH REFUND(give the money back duh)she had to call and wake the manager up(there was no manager or supervisor there on duty)from his sleep and he had to walk her through step by step on how to do a refund! Will never go back to this dennys again!! Better training definitely needs to be implemented at this establishment! Did not want to give any stars but could not post review without giving at least 1 star."}
{"text":"This place is a piece of shit. There were no other customers there except for a big group that seemed to be friends with the workers there. We waited 15 minutes until I got up to tell a server to come take our order. He said \"I'll be with you in a minute\" and was standing there doing nothing. My party and I decided to get out of that shithole. On the way out, I see 3 other employees sitting and chatting with the customers from the other tables. Fuck this place."}
{"text":"POOR SERVICE !!!! DIRTY !!!   I ate there twice. The first time around the service was slow yet I figured its Denny's and they mights have been understaffed. The second time there and notices filthy tables. However, in both instances the staff was very unfriendly. It seems as if they were not trained. I was served by a young waiter that took 10 minutes to get me coffee after I sat down for breakfast.  Then it took another 24 minutes to get the meal.    How long does it take to get eggs with hash-browns? We KNOW FOR A FACT it shouldn't take that long since Danny's use to have a TIME guarantee whereby if you don't get that in 10 minutes the meal if FREE. So we know it should NOT take 24 minutes.   When I complaint to the manager NOTHING was done.  Typical corporate lame duck."}
{"text":"four stars for dennys? for this location in scottsdale, yes: customer service was outstanding today, despite the huge demanding thanksgiving crowd. we were greeted by no fewer than three staff members. raylee advised us of a potential 35 minute delay for our morning meal.  raylee treated us like - say it with me now - rock stars... my excellent rock star wife had the blueberry pancake breakfast, including bacon, eggs, and hash browns. i had the peanut butter cup 'cakes with sausage, eggs, and hash browns. our two delicious meals came on four plates for just under $7 per person. our total bill, including two tasty orange juices and some pretty good coffee came to $22.   the corner booth was clean and comfortable. a great place to watch the pageantry all around us.   we never felt rushed, and although everyone working there was rushing, they handled everything expertly."}
{"text":"Ok so I arrived with my two children to treat them to a night out. We waited 10 minutes (maybe one or two longer) to be seated. I was ignored by the front staff. Now my children and I were seated in the waiting area and then this older couple comes in. The waitress comes up to get them seated, sees me, so I'm assuming she will seat them then come back to seat us...oh no. A couple of guys walk in so I asked if I had to stand to be seated they said no. Then a new waitress, Carol, is asked by the two men to let us be seated before them. She takes our order and then comes back pretty promptly with our food. Well I ordered an appetizer but whatever, our dinner was already there so I can over look one part of the meal forgotten. the food was great! She even gave my daughter goldfish crackers, they didn't come with her meal. Also she gave my children some to take home. She wasn't very warm. she seemed like she wanted us out of there and I felt that more when instead of asking us if we wanted desert or anything else, she brought the bill. My son had been looking forward to having a dessert there he had already picked it out. So if you really want us gone fine, we'll take our business elsewhere...I also had to flag down another waiter to get a to go box, not that uncommon but I waited a good amount of time to try and get her attention. Now that guy was FRIENDLY, face full of smiles and looked at me with kindness instead of the hurry up looks I was getting. Only one other staff member looked at me, none of the rest really would except Carol but she was our waitress. They all had shifty eyes and seemed uncomfortable. So all in all great food, major props to the cooks and the male waiter who smiled at me. the rest need to go to customer service school again...I have worked in food and that is NOT how a customer is to be treated..."}
{"text":"Jenny's FTW. My Drama club would come here after performances, most still in makeup--old people-badgers-dwarves-and somehow we'd look more normal than anyone else there. the servers never batted an eye. So homey.  And food--it's a Denny's. I have no idea what most people expect when they enter one. If you walk in with a sense of entitlement to a good meal, you are mistaken, because its a freaking Denny's.   Embrace the real Americana experience of poor quality food from severely underpaid workers and enjoy the scene. If you go here just for food (or any Denny's for that matter) you have to be brain damaged to complain about it, because its a freaking Denny's and you should either know better or find some class and taste when finding good restaurants.  Jenny's though has actually prepared me many a fine meal with fine service (or fine enough at least). Its a great place."}
{"text":"I been coming in here for about 2 years now and every time I come to this location I am treated like family. All the waitress and waiters are sweet and attentive. This location really knows how to make you feel comfortable and obviously has great management. Food is always delicious as well."}
{"text":"It's been a few months that since I last visited I had a bad experience that time so I figured I would try again. This time it was better Patti was my waitress and she was great. Quick and had a smile, she seems to enjoy her job unlike some of the staff. Maybe things are getting better.  Glad slam is a great quick meal and ask for Patti for a waitress that cares enough to give good service.   Joe W"}
{"text":"From cali just had great service and an awesome burger definitely coming back when Im in town again"}
{"text":"Right on the strip and close to everything but Terrible service and the food was cold.  But very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"There was a cockroach in my food. Shocked and didn't know what to do, I told my waiter. He simply apologized and gave me new food. Disgusted I couldn't eat it and they still made me pay for it. All the waiters were joking about the bug saying it was extra protein and that they try to kill all of them. It was terrifying and I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"So being a sometimes fan of Denny's in the U.S. (Hit n miss to the extreme) excited to try a Canadian Denny's being a country filled with friendlier people.  The service, welcome and friendliness has not disappointed. Love love love the bourbon chicken which is a first taste for me and my server Rupa was awesome   Attentive staff and a clean diner... I knew the cleanliness was possible in Denny's   Thanks for being awesome and for a great experience guys."}
{"text":"Have not been to this location in awhile.  I was very disappointed.  First the food took forever .  Both of us ordered pancakes mine was regular pancakes and my husband was blueberry . Mine looked fine but husband blueberry pancakes was undercook as far  very light in color and just a few blueberries just thrown in at the center.  I ask the server about it all she said that the pancake is upside down so that we would know it had blueberries in it. We ended not eating it.  Not good.  The little bubble in my head said what does she mean by that response.  I figured the cook forget the blueberries at last minute .  Did not look like the menu pic.  Can't  believe that they serve us that. Oh, well . Not a fan of this location."}
{"text":"I don't think I will be returning to this Dennys for some time. It was the worst service I have ever experienced from them ever! I know it's not a five star restaurant but it took forever for the food to come out and then my hamburger was burnt as well as the cheese on it, the bun was super doughy and the seasonal fries were over cooked as well. Took over 30 minutes to get a refill on my drink. The service just flat out sucked, especially it being 5 pm in the afternoon, dinner time they had 3 servers I believe but I saw them most of the time in the back just chatting... I have been to this same Dennys at  2 am and it has been busier and the waitress was much nicer and I didn't have to wait long for anything."}
{"text":"Hey pop. My Dad shares your name! But that's not the only thing you share with him. Last Saturday night you blew our expectations out of the water for my father's 61st. The service was fabulous! Our server, Britney, was so charming and helpful. She knew my needs before I knew i needed them! She always left us smiling. The food was excellent, as usual. All of our plates were polished clean when everyone was done! Furthermore, your manager was extra super gracious and allowed our guttural squat chant to cleanse my father of another year of sin.  Love,  Gwen  5 Stars."}
{"text":"So me and  two other people came in to enjoy a meal I always liked Denny's never though bad thought of that establishment but I will never go to the surprise store EVER again while our server Ashley DeAnda was running around doing everything possible to make our experience memorable while her two bosses can see she coulda used a little help from them they sat back and watched her with out giving any assistance then instead of helping they sat outside smoking cigarettes. After we finished I paid the bill I asked Ashley are you going to ask if the food was good? Ashley replied with \"I'm not allowed to ask the guests that cause her manager gets up set and takes it out in a negative on her if the guest don't like the food\" I was like you got to be kidding me right... So I paid the the bill and walked outside, as I passed through the swinging doors the blonde with glasses gave me a dirty ass look rolling her eyes while the other did the same like me being there was an inconvenience as if they did anything to help her waitress satisfy the needs of the guest... I feel as a manager of a well know professional establishment to do what she does is unacceptable and I will never return to that restaurant again .... Ashley did all she could to be treated like this .... I will be taking my business to village inn where my feedback is appreciated..... If I feel this way how many other feel the same way????"}
{"text":"We went out for dessert after some Christmas activities on December 4th 2016 at 7:45pm because our favorite place was closed for renovations. There were 7 of us and we all ordered a dessert. The waiter told us it would be a while to get our desserts because he had to do it all himself. There were maybe 3 other tables occupied while we were there. We asked him to bring the kids desserts first since it would be a while. However, he ended up bringing them melted ice cream very last after all 4 adults were served their desserts and had already eaten. Keeping them settled down was hard since all they wanted was dessert and had to wait 40 minutes and watch everyone else eat theirs. We ordered two chocolate lava cakes and when we got them they were so incredibly hot that the ice cream on top was completely melted and the cake was a chewy mess. Like the cake was microwaved for a very long time. So gross. We complained and sent them back but received no refund or apologies. Also we ordered 2 apple crisps and after 20 minutes were told that they were out and we would have to choose another dessert. The whole reason we went there was because one of the people we were with had requested apple crisp or pie. The waiter did bring us an extra chocolate shake but no one wanted it as everyone already had ice cream. I'm assuming that was the compensation for the inedible lava cakes. We will never go there again because this was the 2nd time we have went and the second time with horrible service and dirty restaurant and bathrooms. Drive a few miles and go to a different place, I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Service takes forever! Food is inconsistent and poor. Eat down the street at chipotle or mcdonalds instead."}
{"text":"I used to eat here regularly, I live nearby and it was convenient for me but the service is just painfully (and I mean painfully) slow. They are often busy especially on the weekends and mornings but their slow periods you wind up waiting an hour to get served plus another 15 minutes waiting on your server so you can ask for the check which you almost always have to ask to get (I would often give up and just go to the register and tell them what I had). I know it's not just me, I've seen multiple times whole tables of people just get up and leave without ever getting a hint of service after they are seated. To be fair they do have a couple good servers there that really do an outstanding job but on balance I've had to give up going here, I just don't have that kind of patience for the interminable waits to get basic service even when they are not busy."}
{"text":"Went there today for late breakfast and the place was kind of dead.  Food was decent but service was slow especially considering that they weren't busy.  But prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Dennys every morning while we were in Vegas, except our wedding day! It's great value and the food was excellent. It gets pretty busy but we liked to go early so it was only really getting busy as we left."}
{"text":"I love Denny's and my family and I dine in often. I gave 4 stars because we sometimes have problems with our food being made wrong etc. but our favorite waiter Manny is very helpful and fixes the problem right away! Make sure you get Manny because he's awesome!!"}
{"text":"okay spot across from the hospital, gets busy sometimes and can take a lil too long to get your order, one of the staff members is a passively rude person, she's been there forever, maybe too long if you ask me, food not bad though"}
{"text":"Its been over 13 years since my last meal at Denney's.  We came from a long drive from Reno to Las Vegas and we're feeling hungry and it's my birthday. So before going home we decided to get something to eat. But big mistake, the service is poor and the manager didn't even apologize about the burnt cheese on my ultimate skillet. Our server just deducted the amount from our bill and acted like nothing happens. I made a mistake on putting 1 star, Is there an option to put (-) star instead?"}
{"text":"I've been to this Denny's many times. This time, I just had to add this restaurant. It's pretty terrible. This time one of my friends ordered the sampler platter (she ordered it first and I didn't want to get the same thing.)Thankgoodness! It usually comes with Mozarella sticks, chicken strips, and onion rings. Hw came back and said they didnt have chicken strips. WTF!! So they asked if she wanted the shrimp. She said okay. Then he comes back and says they don't have onion rings. So they gave her regular fries and more shrimp. At the end, no compensation or discount. Charges us for the sampler and says he doesn't have the code to give us a discount. TERRIBLE!! I would never recommend this Denny's to anyone!"}
{"text":"Terribly horrible experience!!!! No wonder why I avoid Denny's. I went here only because it was nearby and I'm 6 month pregnant and was starving! I was there for 12 minutes before I had gotten my water. After 20 minutes my sandwich came. It was terrible, super salty snd lacked the \"bacon\" it came with. I asked for a side of fruit. The grapes were disgusting tasting, Apple well I took a pic of it, however the cantaloupe was ok. I ate half of my sandwich for the sheer fact that I was so hungry! Anyway I was asked how it was and I was honest. I said terrible and asked the waiter if it looked good to him. He didn't say a word. I had placed a to go order at the time of my meal order and when he came back with the receipt the to go order wasn't on it. At that time I was even more upset as it had been over 45 minutes since I had been seated! I had been done eating for at least 15 minutes before he came back to take my plate and give me my receipt. I said if the to go order isn't ready I'll pay for what I have, I won't take the to go order. He left and came back around 10 minutes later with the to go order. By that time I was beyond ready to leave!!! He gave me a new receipt with the added to go food. I gave him my payment and away he went for around another 10 minutes. When he came back all I got was a customer receipt with no place to sign. Not that I was giving anyone there a tip for the terribly horrid slow service and crappy food! I'm never setting foot into another Denny's as long as I live. No I'm not pregnant and hormonal I just expect adequate service and good food when I'm paying! That's not an unreasonable request."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre for the price. Took over 40 minutes to receive our meal order. Not worth it at all.."}
{"text":"Service was not great. Food was a half hour late. Only half of the order was served. There was no compensation for the late service or missing orders."}
{"text":"If Yelp would allow it, I would rate zero stars. Our waitress Marlene was fine. The food was as edible as I expected. We didn't go to Denny's expecting an amazing experience. But the young man working there completely ruined it. Talking loudly about how he was about to go into the service and would be qualified to kill people, making mention of the automatic weapons he would have at his disposal, and in general treating the rest of the staff like crap. This isn't what I expect my family and I to be exposed to. Talking to the manager, Tristian, he mentioned that the boy was 18, and adult, and that he was not his parent. The way I see it, Tristian is the manager and responsible for all his staff while they are on shift. He said he would talk to the boy, but showed no concern over the scenario. I paid for the food and left a tip, but only because Marlene and the cooks did their job. I'll eat from the QT before I go back to this place."}
{"text":"It's Denny's, can't expect much.  First time trying out the new location.  I ordered breakfast online, some pancakes, and the breeakfast meal with eggs, hashbrowns, biscuits and gravy and sausage.  In my notes I said bacon insteadof sausage. I didn't check my order before I left.  Got home and no bacon or sausage.  The receipt shows it on there.  There is also a \"verified by\" section on the receipt that wasn't signed.  Guess that means nobody verified the order"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. My husband ordered the slamburger and it didnt come out like the picture at all and he got the wrong fries. I ordered the ultimate skillet and all my veggies n stuff were like mush.overcooked. the kids grand slams were ok. The llast couple times i went there we had a server named natasha last time we didnt tip much because service wasnt too great. I ordered a salad and she like tossed my plate down. This time we had her again and she was very polite n stuff until the end she calls my husband sweetie which wouldnt have been a problem like if she wasnt younger than us. Like what the hell he aint your sweetie and ur like younger than us call him sir or something.l"}

{"text":"Amaaaaaaaazing.  Raul is the best !!!!!!! I've been coming to Denny's for 15yrs always ordered smothered fries he went above and beyond to put smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"My friends and I went there after everything was closing in Downtown. Though the service was okay, the food came out horrible. Worst of all, I ordered an Irish Coffee. They charged me $4.50 for the Irish Coffee and then $5.00 for Baileys.  A $9.00 Irish Coffee. When I complained , the manager said I had to call the General Manager and the District Manager to get any recourse. Never going there again. I absolutely do NOT recommend it."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. In the mornings it's pretty packed, food is actually decent, and you don't feel like you need to bathe after eating there. But the people watching? Classic. :)"}
{"text":"Visiting this Denny's location turned out to be one big fat regret. The \"server\" who \"took care\" of us did a horrible job. Tatted, her thong and butt cheeks hanging out. Long dyed black hair and cake face to be specific. The look on her face and her attitude made me cringe right from the moment she seated us. She didn't approach the situation at hand at all nor did she try to fix it. She talked back and was flat out disrespectful and walked away when I was speaking to her about how my eggs were cooked. Lost my appetite. Thank you to Michael. Customer's always right."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was great....I would have given this place a 5 star rating if it hadn't been for one thing.....overcharging. Watch the menu prices carefully and then check your bill carefully. They openly admitted that the prices that ring up are usually different than on the menu and they DO NOT change it unless the customer notices and wants it changed! So...in the state of Nevada, is that NOT considered stealing?"}
{"text":"My lovely beau didn't want to go after a recent late night out, as he said that he has never had anything other than \"the worst service ever\" at Denny's. In my mind, however, Denny's is firmly tied to shiny happy family trips to Sarasota and the most awesome pancakes a little nine year old heart could wish for. Since he's so sweet, lovely beau agreed to go, though he was not what you would call enthusiastic about it \"Positive manifestation yo,\" I responded with glee. Imagine our delight when our peppy server took our order quickly and had it correct and in front of our hungry faces in, quite literally, five minutes. The beau likes his bacon \"burnt to hell,\" a request that is almost never met. Our convivial young waiter went so far as to ask if the bacon was burnt enough and gladly offered to replace it with crispier pieces if not. Such enthusiasm and pride in his work. At an airport Denny's. At 2am. Most restaurants near my homestead are run by apathetic, snotty high school kids who look as though they may quite possibly gut you for making them lift an entitled little finger to make your food. Or they're just really, really dumb. Not this kid - he was awesome. Well played son - if we're ever in the Cleve again we'll be back and in your section. Three stars because, I mean, it's Denny's. The booths were shredded, the bathroom was covered in pee and smelled like death, and the security guard on duty suggested that things probably get unsettling pretty often. And the bacon wasn't actually crispy enough, but it was nice that our server cared enough to ask. So, five stars for the server, three for everything else. It's also worth noting that a guy who looked just like Ronnie James Dio was at the counter, and that was awesome."}
{"text":"It should be half a star.   My order came completely wrong and tasted like day old leftovers reheated in a microwave.   Waitress never asked about the meal, manager only cared about the bill. So as a disabled marine, i quietly paid & left.   Hence this mention on yelp, twitter, & to their corporate.  Everyone, do not eat at dennys, the food was horrible and the customer service was like the dmv.   Cold and uncaring."}
{"text":"This Denny's is terrible.  The service is very slow and not professional.  Their staff is not friendly.  The food has seen better days.  If you order an appetizer, expect to get it with your meal.  And don't expect refills or any sort of prompt/comeback service.  And there's always at least one worker (or manager??) who will be outside smoking, usually with other customers! How incredibly disgusting, and uninviting.  This place needs to shape up, because it's on the verge of shipping out."}
{"text":"Well since I must put one star let me credit that to the one decent experience I've had here. However the rest have been horrible.   Came here once with my son and got ignored by the waitress. Ordered out another time where they screwed up my order twice and got irritated I had them fix it and now for my most recent experience.  My boyfriend and I got here at around 11pm took the waitress about 15 minutes to get our drink order. I wasn't given ice or a straw with my lemonade. When she came back 20 minutes later for our food order I asked for a straw, she then left WITHOUT taking the food order and didn't return for another 10-15 minutes. When she came back we placed our food order and I had to ask for a straw again. She then left to put in the order and finally returned with a straw....5 minutes go by....10 minutes..... 20 minutes......30 minutes she finally returns to tell us the kitchen \"lost\" the ticket and asked if we would like to put in the order again. Needless to say we left without eating but with time wasted.   This Denny's is just a big heap of disappointment. Crappy service for decent food, every time. You would think they would properly train on customer service due to it's location. Bottom line go somewhere else, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"I've wanted to stop here for a long time so today I did.  I had a great experience.  I was alone and took a seat at the counter and was immediately greeted by a very friendly waitress who got me a drink right away. I couldn't find a BLT on the menu and I asked if they served them. She said they'll serve anything on or off the menu as long as it's in their system, which it was. So, in a matter of about seven minutes, I was served a fantastic looking BLT and seasoned fries. While I was eating, the friendly and funny manager stopped by and asked how I was doing. I told her that I had wanted to stop here before but wasn't sure if I could get here, eat, and get back to work in a reasonable amount of time. She handed me a to-go menu and suggested I call my order in next time and tell them that I'll be eating in. She smiled and said that should shave some time off my schedule. All in all, I had a really nice time and met a couple of really nice people who work there and seem to enjoy what they do. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"What's good service but restaurant was a bit dirty, food was ok, nothing special, but service was good."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. They took 8 orders and only brought 3. Forgot 5 drinks. Heather A. was the waiter I have no idea if it was her fault. Either way the food was bad. My hash browns were hard, sausages didn't taste anything like sausage and had a muddy texture, bacon wasn't even in strips, pancakes were cold. I'm never an angry critic but this was just bad lol. It was our last resort since most restaurants were closed. Now I remember why I stopped liking Denny's."}
{"text":"BEST Denny's that I have been to.  The manager is nice and cares about this location. Very clean and pleasant with TV's all around. The all new wait-staff is professional and pleasant.  Breakfast is great and the fish-n-chips is awesome for those late night drop-ins.  I didn't expect such a grand place and everything was made with perfection.  I know that if there was ever a problem, I would feel comfortable to say something and they would definitely make it right.  Everyone is pleasant and a perfect place to gather for those early morning meetings with staff.  So glad we have this new Breakfast place in N. Scottsdale.  Excellent idea on location and near the Highway to jump-start your day or a drop-in for a late-night Rootbeer Float.... WootWoot!!"}

{"text":"before we went to vegas i checked out all the reviews before we went to the resturants and i told my boyfriend that dennys looked like a no because of all the bad reviews but i gave in and we went and had a good breakfast and cheap. cheapest meals ive ever had in vegas haha. if you are looking for fast service you arent going to get it, u gotta have patiences when u come here because they are extremely busy. but if your just there to chill and take your time its perfect. we actaually ate breakfast here 3 out of the 4 days we were in vegas. we never paid over 17 bucks for our meals and one morning we only paid 7 because they took forever to get my boyfriend his meal so they gave us it for free and then gave us a coupon for the next time. wewill be back,"}

She went and got drink order and took people's order that came in after us.  Ceiling tiles were water stained.  Had cobwebs going from the ceiling to wall mounted speakers.  Eggs were cold, coffee was Luke warm."}
{"text":"Unlike trendier places full of Pseudo-Bohemian bs, this Denny's in particular.. always a pleasure.  The portions are great, the food is made right, and the one Russian lady (we didn't get her name) is a super great waitress!! I guess it takes trying all of the cool kid places to come full circle to see a good thing when it's right in front of me! Thanks Denny's!! :D"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in recently at about 0600 on 12/21, and the restaurant seemed desolate. You would assume that this means good service. The first thing I noticed was the vinyl table with a greasy film. We both decided to deal with it though. Our waitress brought out coffee and to mix cream in, I was going to use the knife in my silverware set. The knife had a thick white film on it that I was able to literally pick off with my nail. I set it aside to try the spoon, and once again, it was nasty. Dried white food crumbs were on it. I requested a new set from the waitress, and she seemed annoyed. As I drank my coffee I began to realize how disgustingly stained the inside of the mug was. The food was about what we expected, but the service and sanitary conditions were very subpar. Both me and my girlfriend are in the food service industry, and at this point it is needless to say that it was outrageously subpar. I can't imagine that I'm the only one that has had this issue, so if I don't get approached in some way to make the situation right, I'll probably be filing a complaint with the state. Tipped $3 and at this point I regret tipping at all."}
{"text":"Food was slow to come out even though the place was mostly empty. When it did come out it was warm, not hit. My wife's country streak was tough and looked a bit over cooked. In addition out took another 5 minutes for the toast that was part of her plate to come. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve / Morning. Only place open in town. Understaffed, extremely slow service. The ladies room smells of sick so profusely that it can be smelled strongly in the vestibule. The hostess is oblivious as to why they are so busy (not even half full). One egg over cooked and the other under."}
{"text":"After 9 months, we've had a late night craving, for Dennys. They've changes their menu, for the better! (It was already awesome and delicious) So during our visit, our host/waiter Ron (from last time, 9 months ago) approaches us, again with the polite and profession manner. Just seeing him makes our experience so much more pleasant. And yes, the food comes out great and in a very quick manner. Love this Dennys"}
{"text":"The five stars is for our server, he was incredible. Especially when you consider the amount of rude tourists and drunk people he must deal with. I am kicking myself for not writing down his name. I was hear for a business trip. Food was warm and brought out quickly. They had a delay on the french toast, but brought us pancakes to tide us over until the french toast could be made, free of charge."}
{"text":"It was gross, filthy - most disgusting bathrooms I've seen in Vegas.  Food was swimming in grease.  The worst part - I got sick my wife got sick and after coming home and speaking to a friend who was sick said she had eaten there too just before she got sick.  By far the worst Denny's restaurant I've stepped foot in.  Don't go there."}

{"text":"We used to come here 2 to 3 times a week. The service and the food is way below standard. How does a breakfast establishment serve cold coffee?  How is it we order hash browns crispy everyone and the always come out barely cooked. The last 3 to 4 visits. They forget something from the order. I won't ever go back to this location"}
{"text":"Just walked out...horribly slow service. Sat and sat and sat...waiting for my order. Hostess warning patrons \"only 2 servers\"...but a near empty restaurant, it shouldn't be a problem, should it? Oh well, I had a fairly large order...let them sort it. Wasted 45 minutes sipping a club soda. One star for the club soda. So went across the street to El Charro Taco Shop...one lady handling EVERYTHING. Ratiowise she's got waaaaaay more going on...order taken and served within 15 minutes...along with the 10 other patrons here. Just goes to show you efficiency is a skill."}
{"text":"The staff are so friendly and welcoming. Made stopping in worth it. The food was average but good value."}
{"text":"Tonight was the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant. We were seated quickly and received our drinks but were soon forgotten about because we didn't have penises. Our waitress clearly wanted to have sex with one of the five guys at the other table. She literally told us she forgot about us. We still stayed for quite a while, at least fifteen minutes in freezing conditions until we decided to leave once realizing the people who were seated 20 minutes after us received their food, before the waitress even came to us again. If all a waitress wants is sex from patrons she should be working at a strip club and not Denny's. Do not go here."}
{"text":"My family and I went there on August 4.  The food was OK, but the kitchen screwed up my wife's order, putting cheddar cheese on her burger when she'd ordered Swiss.  It was the waitress who ruined the meal.  The woman didn't smile once. She had zero personality. And, while we were trying to figure out what we wanted for dessert, she dropped our bill in front of my wife. I guess she decided we'd had enough.  And then we looked at the bill, noticed that cheese wasn't mentioned on my wife's order at all, and realized the problem with the order was probably her fault, too. Maybe it was near the end of her shift and she'd stopped caring?  Because both my wife and I have worked (and she still works) in the service industry, on our $72 bill we would have normally rounded up to an even $100. We tip very, very well; usually 30% or more if the food/service is decent. Last night, we rounded up to $80 and went somewhere else for dessert and coffee.  Will we go back? Probably. But not anytime soon. And if we get that same waitress, we'll ask to sit somewhere else or just leave."}
{"text":"One of the BEST Denny's I've been to.  Service was excellent and I was extremely happy with the food.  They added this new appetizer to the menu...nachos with different dips...EXCELLENT....and I got my usual SuperBird....excellent as always."}
{"text":"I have never had bad service at this location. The food is always spot on and I am greeted with a friendly hostess. Last night I went and no one greeted me, the service was slow (because they were busy and only had three waiters on) AND I still left satisfied. Alicia really helped us out and did a great job keeping our waters full and our food came as promptly as it could. GREAT customer service will keep me coming back to this location.  Plus THUMBS UP for the new decor!"}
{"text":"I don't expect much when I go into a Denny's but decent service is not that difficult. I have been here twice and I will not be returning. Both times I have gone it hasn't been very busy yet I am left to wait for water or any one to greet me. I had a problem with my order at my last visit and my server simply shrugged his shoulders and said, \"sorry\" as he walked off.  Unacceptable. Especially when other locations are excelling at customer service."}
{"text":"First time I've gone to this location and been disappointed with the service and portion size. I only give two stars because the location is generally clean and generally good service for your dollar. The manager and the server were both told my impression in the nicest possible way with barely any recognition."}
{"text":"Terrible service and and the waitress was rude and took took long for our orders. Would not recommend if in a hurry."}
{"text":"Three stars.  It's Denny's.  But wait, it gets better.  We came in on a Saturday morning following a heavy evening of indulgent hedonism.  The first thing I notice is the guy wearing a plastic nose, but he's not dining alone.  His large stuffed dog has accompanied him on this meal and seems to be quite happy sitting on top of the table.  The gentlemen appeared to be having the time of his life and even got up to play the air piano at one point.  These are moments that only occur in Vegas.  I forget our server's name but this guy was totally on top of his game.  Our order took a while to come out but the soda refills were flowing like Niagara.  The food?  Well it's Denny's, it tastes like food.  I come here about once a year and that will probably continue until I move.  Thanks for the memories Denny's."}
{"text":"Poor management- we were there last night. There was a employee truly upset. Complaining about only making 5 an hour, how much he hated working there, slamming items. The manager on duty did nothing. I could not believe this and video taped it."}
{"text":"Smells like sewer inside absolutely disgusting and makes you want to throw up and leave the place.  Service is horrible waitresses give you attitude.  Don't waste your time here.  Food isn't bad overall."}
{"text":"We travel a lot and I like the familiarity of the menu.  This restaurant always serves fresh food and is better managed than most of the dennys we have visited in the past.  I always get a salad, and the soup."}
{"text":"Awesome service by Jessica m must say food is worth the wait. The best thing is the fresh milkshakes (Oreo and chocolate). Food portion is large which makes your tummy happy"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food,and the service, I received at this Denny's location today. I ordered the Everyday Value Slam (two eggs, two sausages, and  two pancakes). I specifically told the Waitress that I wanted my eggs fried hard, and to break the yolks--because runny yolks make me ill.    Additionally, I ordered a side of Hash Browns--which I never received.I had to send the eggs and pancakes back.The second time around, the eggs were recooked correctly but the  pancakes were still gooey and undercooked.   Also, for the second time, I reminded the Waitress that I didn't receive my Hash Brown order. She said \"OK\" but she never brought the order to the table, and she never added it to my bill.  I asked to speak with the Manager, but was told by a Cashier that he or she went to the Bank. The Cashier was very sarcastic and unapologetic. Furthermore, she didn't even ask for my contact information-- to give to the Manager, to call me when he or she returned."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Really Grrreat service and atmosphere. Will keep coming for the food, price and service. Parking is small due to the timeshare next door."}
{"text":"Do not come here unless you have all day to wait. The food is really good but 90% of their staff are incredibly rude. The hostesses seat at random regardless of if they knew you were there before others then you wait 45 minutes for your food and another 20 to pay for the experience."}
{"text":"There are a few times in life that I question my decision to eat somewhere. When I arrived, there were but a handful of patrons. The staff seemed distracted and I questioned if I should seat myself. When taken to the table it could have been wiped down better. The menu was sticky  (yuk, germ city).  The wait staff once they were able to focus were friendly, and felt like you may have known them forever. The building is gorgeous. An oldtime diner. I know the staff are busy, but the cleaning staff should at least get the food off the stainless steel trim, and glass block dividers. Music was nostalgic, a trip down memory lane, good match for the style of the diner.   The wait staff have been hustling, not a hesitation to clear a table or refill your coffee cup.  I have eaten at a lot of Dennys this trip. This one had the most character, which is a plus; just needs to be cleaned better.  I would not go out of my way to return, took 30 minute for food to arrive and the food tasted odd. The only way I can describe it - like old cooking oil. Too bad first Dennys to disappoint."}
{"text":"Horrible service.. Two parties left before they were even seated. The waiter brought our food, forgot our silverware and didn't bring it after reminding her twice. After that we asked for water and never got it.."}
{"text":"After a call with no answer and hung up on the second time, I was able to attempt to order food to go on the third time. The gal who was taking my order had a language barrier and I couldn't understand anything she was saying. She told ms it would be ten minutes but after arriving fifteen minutes later the food wasn't ready. Giving two stars because the food was correct and pretty delish."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have written review if my experience was just the terrible food. I feel like a lot of people in vegas have come to the conclusion that all Denny's in Las Vegas serves awful food. However, my particular experience was quite awakening on how terrible the customer service is. I went in to this Denny's because it's across the street from my college campus, CSN. I went to eat with my mentor whom happens to be completely deaf but she has great oral abilities. The waiter when he approached us realized one of us or both of us was deaf because we were signing. He stared off by screaming \"what can I get you to drink?\" My response was, \"I'm not deaf, but she is. No matter how loud you tell, she can't hear you, but she can read your lips very well and she speaks great. So when you talk to her, you have to face her so she can read your lips.\" He then looked at me and asked me what she wanted to order. I politely looked at him and told him to ask her, because I'm not here to interpret a food order. He then raised his voice to ask her what she wanted to drink. She told him, and then took my order and left. When he came back to take our food orders, he continued to look at me while speaking about her as if she wasn't there. I reiterated that he needs to look at her when speaking to her, and he can take her order from her. He then started talking down to her like she was a pet. I was completely dumbfounded at the amount of disrespect shown towards my mentor. She is deaf, not stupid. I reiterated the proper way to speak to a deaf person and was blatantly ignored. This particular area has shown us nothing but respect when we go out to eat, so we will eat somewhere else from here on."}
{"text":"We went at nighttime. My food was okay and my boyfriend's was too greasy.  The manager was a jerk. They weren't super busy but he barely acknowledged us when we came in.  My boyfriend ordered a cookie milkshake. It took forever to come out and the waitress kept forgetting and going oh I'll bring it right out. The manager finally brought it but it was the wrong type of shake. He rolled his eyes and looked incredulous when I mentioned it. My boyfriend just settled on taking it and he left without a word. It had too much syrup and was really liquidy.  There was a couple sitting near us that had been sitting there for about 12 minutes after being seated. After that, he went over to them and with a raised voice asked them \"Are you going to order? You've been sitting here with menus in front of your face for almost 15 minutes!\"  Bad experience!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Denny's in the Phoenix Valley. It's always clean and friendly. I am typically a total A Hole when it comes to restaurants and service, but I have never had an issue at this location.   The one on Rual and the 60 in Tempe and all other Denny's I've had in the valley is a completely different story...I actually stopped eating at Denny's for over a year until a friend took me to this location on University and 48th at."}
{"text":"So I am sat at the counter and waited for my server for about 10 mins. Then while waiting for my food the manager worked in front of me without saying hi once. \"Small Mexican lady who was older\" I finally get my food and I am missing my appetizer. Well they went and got it but that should have came out before the meal. Then I had to go get my own silverware. Horrible experience. The only good side was this Spanish gay waiter. He wasn't my server but he did at least speak. My server was a heavier set black lady with braids in her hairs. She was very pleasant but none too bright. The place wasn't even busy lol"}
{"text":"Worse place ever. I came in with my service dog and the host gave me a hard time about having him. After that manager came in and said that he had a complain and I hadn't even spend 5 minutes there. He said if my dogs were service dogs and stated that federal law and health department he couldn't have my dog."}
{"text":"Do not recommend unless you're ready for a1 hr wait for food for 2 people. 15 minute wait just for the water and coffee. They tell you they only have 2 servers, but you can clearly see 5 -6 people taking orders and serving. Just slow service and poor communication."}
{"text":"Okay so the waiting service was absolutely AMAZING from Charles. He was very professional and checked in on things regularly while actually engaging our kids for decisions and feedback on the food.   Note for the food... I ordered the lumberjack slam and was disappointed in the amount of hash browns I got as it was only two bites, the sausage was burned, but the eggs and cheese were great. All the other orders seemed to be just fine and done well. The only other issue we had was the food took a while."}
{"text":"I saw that this had a low rating and almost didn't go... I'm glad I did the service was a little slow but the food was excellent. My mom and I are really lucky and we both hands down agreed it was the best pancakes we've ever had."}
{"text":"I don't like zoning on here to write bad reviews but this place is the worst. Service and food. Took forever to get seated, staff wasn't really concerned with the fact that we had been waiting forever. Then finally when we were sat down it took 25 mins. for someone to come by and bring us water. Needless to say once the food got there it was the straw that broke the camels back. Raw meat, burnt toast, dry sausage. Never again. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I went to other Dennys in town. This one is my favourite.. Fast service and good food. They recently added a desert Manu ..which is great and affordable 4.99."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Denny's in Las Vegas - get there early, fill up with food, and you won't need to eat until dinnertime. I'd recommend the Grand Slam - and go easy on that bottomless rocket fuel coffee, that stuff makes my eyeballs shake - not that I'm complaining, of course."}
{"text":"Group of 5 guys just wanting some coffee and a small meal. Food was good but for starters; the coffee was cold, everyone had to ask for fresh coffee. Waitress didn't even know the menu and asked \" what else am I supposed to ask you on that one?\" Ha! Are you kidding me.   Ohh and as soon as we enter the door the first thing you hear is cursing, by the staff!?! Come on people...."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today what a disappointment. Seated fairly fast but waited around 10 minutes for the waitress to stop and take our order. Around an hour after arrival we still had not received our food although people that arrived after us were eating. During the entire time the waitress did not stop by to refill coffee or anything. When we finally found her she said the manager was going to bring over our food immediately. 10 minutes later she showed up with our food. At that point we paid for our coffee and left without eating - not giving them any more money for such poor service. Found the manager on the way out and all he could say was \"sorry sir\".   Place is a joke."}
{"text":"Terrible service but edible food.  When we came in I asked for a corner booth but was told they were all closed so I had to sit in a center booth. Really? The section is open but not the corner?   It took 44 minutes for our food and the omelet was served with unmelted processed cheese slices. I ordered the Tuscan Super Bird... poorly prepared,  way too much mayo, wrong bread.  Worse Dennys experience ever."}
{"text":"We go to Denny's regularly at home for breakfast so were really disappointed with this visit - lazy server, and the portions were tiny - Philly cheesesteak omelette had three slivers of steak. My fit fare slam had undercooked turkey bacon, the smallest portion of eggs I've seen in awhile, unripe fruit, and an cold English muffin with no butter at all. We'll avoid this location on future trips to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place. I live down the street and this place always serves well drunk nights or early breakfast.  I ate at a dennys recently in Las Vegas Nevada, and it was horrible.  It almost made me not to eat at any dennys restaurants. I came back to Arizona and I had this local dennys and it was amazing! Dennys is back on my list of good restaurants."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch one day and the waitress sat me down in a booth that had dried pancake syrup or something similar on the bench seat since they had not bothered to clean the seats. Realized I was stuck to the dried syrup when I tried to slide over. Had to go change clothes. Pants and back of a knitted shirt were affected. The stuff didn't come out of the shirt entirely in the wash."}
{"text":"Slowwwww....do yourself a favor and go somewhere else... Anywhere else!  Inattentive service and dirty too.  Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"It is what it is.  First, the food never comes out like the pictures on the menu.  Second, you are really getting service more than the food.  We were traveling and provided a better experience that fast food for not much more money, especially when you factor in the free refills on pop."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and we had the all american slam breakfast and the club sandwich.  It was very busy.  The breakfast was really great with perfectly cooked eggs.  Unfortunately, my wife's sandwich had 4 1/2 wooden sticks in it.  She pulled out 4 of them and another 1/2 of a wooden stick was hidden in the sandwich.  She almost broke her tooth on it!  Very irresponsible of them.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Rose is the best waitress!!! Very friendly, helpful and fast service. I had the pumpkin pancakes, delicious.  :)"}
{"text":"Manager and server went beyond to help us order something on the menu that some other Dennys allow for substitutions as we don't eat pork and requested a fruit bowl as we usually do.    Apparently each Dennys allows different things and all are not the same as we expect from a chain restaurant in the same city and province of Alberta.    They happily accepted our substitution and punched it into the register to even come out slightly cheaper.    I think our efficient and very pleasant server was Amanda and manager was V.. something. .sorry. .Indian decent. .extremely helpful. .  Also their curry soup was excellent. . Tasted just like a Thai restaurant we loved back in BC !   This isn't the closest Dennys to us but next closest and still easy to get to. We will be going here from now on. .   Thank you for a really enjoyable meal and great customer service!  Five stars!"}
{"text":"Coffee cups were dirty and the waitresses were not very attentive. My hash browns were so minimal and crunchy I could barely eat them. Usually I have something good to say in my reviews, but not today. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Yeah, not the greatest location in town, but compared to our horrible experience that we had at the Denny's at 3001 S. Las Vegas (see my review on that one), this one was heaven!  Restaurant was not crowded, and we were seated and served promptly.  Jorge was an attentive waiter, food came out on time and tasted great.  He did mess up on my drink (gave me a real coke instead of diet), but no real worries other than that.  The place gets knocked a star because of its placement next to the smoky casino, and does look a little \"dive-y\", but food and service were good so can't complain too much (especially since we hadn't eaten in over 12 hours)."}
{"text":"Couldn't give an honest assessment of the food since we ended up walking out.  Waited nearly 5 minutes to be seated (there was no one in front of us when we got there).  First thing we see is a waitress complaining that the order she's holding was not what the customer wanted, and another waitress was kind of arguing with her about it.  FInally got seated, then waited at least another 5 minutes before our waitress came by, who happened to be the complaining waitress above.  She asked what we wanted to drink, my wife said coffee, and then I told her we're ready to order.  She then said we'll have to wait a minute and took off.  Again, we waited another 5 minutes, no coffee in sight, and noticed no one was getting their food, and another waitress was apologizing to folks about why it was taking so long.  We ended up walking out, which we rarely do unless service is horrible, which this absolutely was."}
{"text":"Don't come here. This location is awful. Got in at 12:15 for what I thought would be a fast late night meal and it is now 1:07 and I still haven't gotten my food. I mean I don't know how difficult it is to make 2 scrambled eggs 2 pancakes and 2 sausage links but this is awful. The workers only seem to come out and provide service when they notice someone leaving just to make sure that they actually pay I'm guessing? Terrible. I won't be coming back to this location at night I'm sure the ihop across the street will appreciate this. Bottom line don't come to this Denny's location unless you want to spend your entire dam night here."}
{"text":"Our waitress was a huge fan of Zelda. We saw a table of 5 dine and dash. We won 2 prizes in the claw game. Basically this is the best Denny's of all time."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I am not a fan of Denny's, or breakfast food places in general. Do I like breakfast foods?  Yes, but I dunno I guess I'd rather make it myself.   Anyway I've been to this Dennys twice in the past 30 days and I am digging the 2,4,6,8 menu. For basically whatever you can spend you can get some decent eats.  I have gone for a cordon blue sandwich once and a chipotle chicken entree another time, which because its $8 comes with a drink. (Soft drinks avg 2.50 cents when dining out, so thats a good savings).  You also get 2 sides with it, and I loved the spinach with bacon and pico they had and the cheeeesy mash potatoes.    The service was real nice both times I went, and the restuarant seemed fairly clean. I've been into some messy Denny's before but this one was above par for sure.   Honestly for a meal like that, with a drink, and under 10 bucks; I'd recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Im surprised Dennys CORPORATION lets franchise owners embarass their namebrand this way. This location is so beyond disgusting and in need of a desperate overhaul. Literally it needs torn down amd rebuilt. The building is shit. The parking lot os shit and full of holes. Trash everywhere outside cigarettes all over. It literally smells like an ashtray near the doorway. For many years this location has gone downhill. Not even sure how theu can afford to stay open because everyone in the area knows not to go here."}
{"text":"Unreal! Showed up only to have some nitwit little teen roll her eyes when my partner kissed my cheek. Seated us then no one even came to take a drink order after ten minutes waiting and it wasn't that busy. I guess if you are some knuckle dragging bigot this is a good place for cheap crappy food...I'll be taking my GAY money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at this Denny's again and serves was great and the food was great also.  I guess the last time I was here they had problems with the waiters that were working then.  They must of worked it out some way.   Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Terrible!!! For someone working on tips you'd think they would do a good job. Our waitress Leanne probably checked in on us once. I'm not one to nag about this because I know how hard this job can get. But com'mon! 20 minutes to get some water. 15 minutes after we're done with our food is when we get our check. And even after we get up to pay we had to wait another 10 minutes to get checked out."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Waited over 30 minutes for my food and my food was still cold. Management and staff had no concerns of how long I had been waiting with my family for our food. Strongly recommend another denny's! Nothing was compensated for the wait."}
{"text":"Always come here for breakfast with the family and never had a problem. But I do not recommend it for lunch or dinner. Their servers are extremely slow and got my order wrong a few times. I don't understand because the place wasn't even busy. Food was good but the customer service was awful. Waiter didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"Denny's is great. I always get food to go there, and the presentation is on point. They have awesome containers that keep everything where it belongs.thanks Denny's"}
{"text":"Decent place if you cant hold your hunger longer...Service was average and joint casino smoke sipped in since there is no division. Big difference from the one at the strip just couple of miles away"}
{"text":"I love this Danny's it's close to my house the staff is excellent especially Becky. Every time my husband and I go she knows exactly what to get us to drink. We are not left just sitting there. Our drinks are always refilled she's great."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst dining experience anywhere! Do not waste your money or time. We had very little expectations to begin with going to a Denny's but just wanted a decent meal with our kiddos after a long day. We walked in and no one was at the host table for at least 5 minutes. We were seated and the place was nearly empty. A guy came and took our drink order and didn't come back for 10 minutes. A lady came after 10 minutes and asked for our drink order. We told her the guy took it and she disappeared only to return a few minutes later to ask for our drink order again. We got our drinks 20 minutes later and hadn't even ordered our food yet. She finally came back to take our order. An hour later we had to flag someone down to find out where our food and waitress was. We had not even gotten a single drink refill or seen our waitress. She comes back and we ask how much longer our food will be and if we can get refills. She disappears again comes back with no refills and says to be honest it's at least another 20 minutes! We had been there going on 2 hours! We only ordered eggs and pancakes and a cheeseburger! When we told her we were going to leave without food she had the nerve to demand we pay for our drinks! My husband talked to another waitress who said not to worry about the drinks. Will never set foot back in there!"}
{"text":"Why does a Denny's run out of pancake batter?!?"}
{"text":"Came for break fast and was not disappointed. Food was fabulous .I had the Mediterranean omelet and loved it very good."}
{"text":"Just went last night for a late night dinner and the service was incredible.  Food was really good and the hostess and the waitress were friendly and helpful,  i would recommend this location for anyone"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Many empty table although many people waiting. Servers seem slow and unconcerned. Manager does not do a very good job with customer service or motivating his employees.  A totally unpleasant experience!!"}
{"text":"we sat outside,perfect in the shade had great\friendly service, good tasting food,my burger on sourdough was excellent, the coffee always great at Dennys, i really enjoyed seating outside, 1st time ever at a Denny's...i'm ready to go back very soon"}
{"text":"There should be an option for ZERO STARS.     I'm not expecting a lot from Denny's but this was REALLY BAD. Let me explain, first we ordered a sampler, no mozzarella sticks available. Our server offered either more onion rings or chicken strips as a substitute. We took the onion rings. I asked for a glass of water 3 times before getting it. We got 2 overcooked chicken strips and a plate of onion rings so overcooked most of them broke into pieces when  you bit into them. I never got the buffalo sauce I asked for. Our server offered to bring more coffee twice but never did bring it. Another server saw my empty cup and refilled it for me after I put my empty cup at the edge of the table for a bit. Our server never came back to take our food order. By the time she remembered we had already decided to get our check and leave. She saw my husband looking around the corner for her and asked us if someone else had taken our order! When we went to pay I told the guy at the counter about the server never taking our food order and he smiled and laughed it off saying they were busy. He said I should bring it to the servers attention if they weren't doing their job. I told him that was managements job, not the customers.  I let the host know I was unhappy with the food and service, he never offered to get a manager or even apologized."}
{"text":"Great food, bad service. My server Erynne was practical not even here. She served my Apple juice at room temperature in a dirty glass. Another server brought out my food and refilled my coffee. I waited about 8 minutes to get my bill after I was finished eating. For this being Americas Diner, it leaves a lot to be desired. Seeing as there is a Golden Corral next door, I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I waited nearly ten minutes with servers walking right past me and not once did anybody say hi or offer to serve me. When I noticed the staff going to the tables that came in after me, I decided it was time to leave. There was a manager in the front so I told him that I was leaving because nobody came to serve me. He offered to serve me personally and to cover the bill, which I thanked him for, but politely refused. He then stood in front of me, blocking me from the exit, and tried to usher me back to the table. I again told him that I was no longer interested in dining in his restaurant, and he continued to try make me stay. I finally had to walk through him and leave despite his ongoing protest for me to stay. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great Place, for a very Tasty Breakfast,Lunch or Dinner! Staff was great! They had alot of good teamwork going on how busy it was today!  Sarah served us, she was great!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was so tasty! First time there and will definitely be returning.  Ramiro our server did a brilliant job"}
{"text":"My problem is not with the service I received or with the regular staff here. I am a regular customer at this Denny's for over 5 years. My problem is with the poor management in the recent months. It is my understanding that this restaurant has recently changed management. Since this change has occurred I have noticed a lot of changes that I do not see as good changes. The atmosphere here has changed for the negative. The servers are always on edge by the way the new manager treats them. I have witnessed on several occasions the head manager, Deborah I believe her name is and her assistant named Chris, yelling and criticizing employee's right in front of customers. Neither one of them want to pitch in to help when the restaurant is busy, they just yell across the room at the employees.  I have also seen the head manager make customers wait in the lobby area for 45 minutes with empty tables. When asked about this on one incident, she replied that the server that had those tables is not very good and they can't handle anymore customers.  I was had several friends with me on this visit and asked the server to split our checks. She said the person at the front had to do it. When we got to the front, it took almost 15 minutes for the manager to figure out what each of us had. When we asked why it couldn't be split at the table with the server that knew our orders, she informed us that she made that decision because she didn't trust her servers to split it and make sure everyone paid at the desk. This is insulting to us as customers and to the people she has working for her. I could go on and on about the different things I have seen here over the last few months from Deborah and Chris, but I would be here all night. The employees here are great, and have some really good people...Liz, Roxanne, Candy, Dan, Deborah. These are some of the best severs I have met, but because of this new management, I don't think I will ever visit this Denny's again. As for that, I don't ever thing I will visit another Denny's, ran by the same company either. And I will encourage anyone I know to avoid them too."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Bourbon Skillet and Chicken Bacon Sandwich. The Chicken Bourbon skillet surpassed my expectations! It was so good! Our server, Nicole, recommended it. So glad I listened. Service was great and I would get this meal again!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. But IT is ICE COLD there.... and Thea colaen the out door destinasjon for some reason. It was like sitting in a fridge. I even wore a sweater"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Live near here and have gone many a times to meet for a late night meal or a breakfast on the weekends. We finally stopped going because our orders were always wrong, the food was even worse than standard Denny's fare, and the staff is horrible. Hickeys all over their necks, dirt under finger nails, greasy grimy hair, dirty uniforms were the final straw. Go over to the IHOP at 19th and Northern. It's not fabulous but at least the staff is decent...."}
{"text":"Typical Denny's - fast service mediocre food"}
{"text":"This was an oasis (also happens to be across from the Mirage) in a desert of horrible overpriced food. We loooved our breakfast here. Good coffee, Denny's-level food, and our waitress, Monica, was so great. She's really great with people and I really appreciated her approach to service. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Came on Jan. 13,2015 service was horrible. No one was busting tables and they were sitting people dowm at dirty tables. I am writing this and have been sitting here almost an hour and have had no serivice to get my coffee refilled and no food still."}
{"text":"Waiting for 30mins to get food.Beef was burned dark surface.ask for straw and after finish drinking it still not show up.waiter wrote on the bill 20%tip...."}
{"text":"Gross nasty I know this isn't a 5 star place but they should have some level of standards and not be serving rotten food . Now wonder we were the only ones here . Waitress was nice"}
{"text":"Man do I love Dennys!! A perfect cheep alternative breakfast instead of going to an expensive buffet or one of the Hotels restaurants. Located right on the strip by MGM and across from NY NY.   If you making the trip to Sin City and a breakfast lover on a budget. I suggest hitting up this spot."}
{"text":"The place look nice and the food is so good. But, the host didn't welcomed us properly. She is so mean. Her name is Nekita."}
{"text":"This place is alway clean friendly and great with hot food. Our waiter to day is Joseph and he is a top notch. He is 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Got seated right away but then no waitress ever came to see us for over 15 minutes. While we waited we did get to listen to the two waitresses yell at the cook for making food incorrectly and food that \"looks gross\". Mind you there were only two tables of customers at the time. After waiting a few more minutes we decided to leave between the not being acknowledged and the openly made bad food review by both waitresses."}
{"text":"Late night stop in and yes I had been drinking but still have memory to review.  Denny's is what it is- its not high end cuisine, it is able to hit that spot when you need to crush an omlette after a night of drinking.  This stop in was no different.  Nice staff, d√©cor nothing great, food was adequate and what I needed although there was some confusion about sausage instead of bacon."}
{"text":"Had lunch on 7/8/16. I qualified for the senior menu and ordered a turkey club. The waitress asked if I wanted regular fries or seasoned fries I ask what seasoned fries were and she said they were like curly fries without the curls. I said I'll try the seasoned fries. Lunch was good. Food was good and fries were good. Got the bill and found that there was an extra charge for the fries. I asked the waitress if fries were not included with my meal. She said they were but the seasoned fries were extra. I asked her why she did not tell me it was more. She said her manager told her she was not allowed to tell the customers the seasoned fries were extra. She said that the added fee was the one thing she could not say. She showed me on another page of the menu that the fries are extra in price. I said I see it now but it is not anywhere near the senior menu. Just saying. My opinion when steering customers off their order you should tell them there is an added fee if there is one. Poor business practice."}
{"text":"The food it's great like always but the customer service really but the chunky white girl who was our server  she shoulder being working here,  thank you to the manager she was really nice after works,"}
{"text":"pretty good for a dennys but you have to remember it is still a dennys. food was ok, took about 15 minutes. bathroom smells quite bad. I recommend the chicken Philly sandwich."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled. Food and service is good. I typically get the chicken philly melt, which is a chicken sandwich on a hoagie roll with a side. Overall will return, but like other reviews it is a dennys. If you're looking for five star dining this isn't your stop. If you're looking for a quick, good meal then here ya go!"}
{"text":"This Denny's location at 17 & Carefree Highway always keeps us coming back. The food and service are always good and consistent and the managers are quick to correct any problems with the meal. They always take care of us and it's become a regular weekly casual breakfast or dinner stop for our family."}
{"text":"Why did we eat here. Oh my gosh, it's Denny's horrible tourist food. Everything was either too salty or too sweet. It was very clean and the service was good. It was my first time at Denny's I knew what it was going to be like and I got exactly what I expected. Lol!"}
{"text":"Everything was standard Dennys.  However, they really need to do something about their booth seats. It was like sitting on a blanket thrown over a bunch of large rocks."}
{"text":"My managers visited this location on their lunch break. It took someone 20 minutes, before they came over to give them water. It took another 30 minutes for the food to be placed. The customer service was the worst ever. The manager gave us a discount on our lunch, and we made a complaint with the manager. Overall,  I will not recommend this location to anyone especially on your lunch break."}
{"text":"there was bug in my coffee this morning the coffee was old and cold, I told the server she just laugh and she said she Is making new pot, well that mean I got the last cup from the old pod and little bugs flying every where and finally landed in my coffee, horrible experienced."}
{"text":"Only Denny's in Vegas that offers no substitutions.  asked for an extra egg or fruit instead of pancakes and they refused.   I've never had a problem at any other Dennys with such a substitution..   they give you one egg"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this Denny's. The night server Tyler is an amazing waiter!  One night I had an awful experience and honestly its made me want to never go back. The waiter I had working along side Tyler the night I last went in was so rude. My mom ordered an iced coffee because she asked the waiter what she should get that had refills. He suggested it and when she asked for a refill, he told her they were out. Why he couldn't have mentioned that before is beyond me. So she asked for hot coffee, ice, and the flavoring syrup for it. He brings her out the coffee, and brings her pancake syrup. Why? I have no idea. Then she ordered a skillet with a few substitutions and he brings out a plate of chicken, cheese on top, and avocados. She asked what it was and he said \"this is what you get after you take basically everything off\" and she had only gotten two of the 8 items taken off the plate. She asked him to remake it and he laughed at her and walked away. We asked the manager to fix it and she did, but instead of asking Tyler to serve us, she continues to allow our waiter to continue. My sisters bowl of spaghetti then comes out hard like it had been sitting there for a while, and she asked for a new one, and while she was waiting she ate all of her bread. The manager had taken her plate off the bill due to it being so hard, so when it came back and my mom asked for more the waiter told my mom we would have to pay for more. She said no, because she had to eat it while she waited because she was hungry and that it wouldn't be on the bill. He laughed yet again and argued with us. Then to top it off, he comes and asks if we want more drinks for the first time when we are already done eating and asks my sister \"do you want another coke or a sprite instead?\" And my sister says \"coke\" and he brings back a sprite and she asks him to change it and he says \"no this is what you ordered\" the whole meal was ruined and it was just a mess. I don't think I'll be going back sadly"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, his brothers, his brother's wife, and his niece went to Dennys in Century Three.  And while many know of Denny's racist history complete with law suits, his sister in law didn't and after playing  and singing all day for a church Christmas concert they were starving. She wanted to go there. The fellas obliged her.  Long story short, they waited on by a curt waitress that put grenadine in their water instead of sprite. The waitress did not appear to them for a long time and after taking their drink orders she did not reappear until much later with drinks that were not what they wanted or just botched.  There were two other tables there with white patrons. Servers ignored his table and to attend the white tables. A highlight was a nice kid that came in on his day off and took their order. But after that he was put to work in the kitchen. They didn't get their food for a hour. And even then the waitress walked past their table, and went to a white table where people already had their food and asked if anyone ordered a skillet meal.  My boyfriend's sister in law was crying because she knew why they were being ignored. My boyfriend was livid and flagged her down saying it's for her.  They served him and the two year old with them  last when all the food came out.  One of his brother's spoke with the manager after it was all over. And the manager discounted the meal for half. Which is nice, but doesn't excuse the poor behavior of staff."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in a Dennys my family and I have ever experienced. We waited an hour and half for our food and they werent even packed that's unexceptable. We understand it's Christmas eve and all but as a resturant chain you should be prepared for anything.The hostess working there has no buisness working she was lazy and there were alot of tables waiting to be bused and she just looked at them like they weren't her problem. I give them 1 star because the waitress was trying her best to get us our food out as soon as she could."}
{"text":"We come in @11PM of July 1, 17 Canada Day.  The host is very rude and yelling to us. That's a No No! Don't talk to your customers like that. We are talking to her nicely, and she gets upset that we don't want to sit as a group in the side she wants us to be, and want to Charge 18% for service charge. We said no, we are eating separately per  Family. We drove here with 4 Cars/family, 4-5 people each car.  After we explain that, she still keep on yelling at us. So we decided not to eat here and we all left. #veryDisappointed"}
{"text":"Took an hour and 27 minutes to get 2 pancakes, and they didn't forget about us either"}
{"text":"it's Denny's food so you know what you're getting, but if you go to this Denny's, ask for joseph! he makes up for the average food and makes it a 5 star meal."}
{"text":"We always go to this Denny's.. but we usually dine in.. Tonight I dropped in for take away.  A server named Rachel took my order and helped when what I wanted was no longer on the menu.. she made it possible for me to order it anyways.  I didn't check the order before leaving the restaurant..  It was perfect except the kitchen neglected to include my bread.  My family is kind of particular about certain things and we almost always special order. All the \"special\" orders were remembered and the server was awesome.  I was out the door, food in hand within 12 mins of placing the order.  The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was the meals were a little on the small side and the forgotten bread.  You always know what you'll get with Denny's food, but the service can be dodgy. Tonight it was beyond good and Rachel rocks!!!"}
{"text":"ok, i used to not enjoy denny's. i thought they used to be overpriced compared to alot of cheaper places. they've made alot of changes to their menu and prices. i really enjoy it now. i only go here for breakfast. they have breakfasts for $2,$4,and a large omlette breakfast for $6. the $2 bisquits and gravy and awesome, and yes, only $2 for a big plate of bisquits and gravy. ther food quality is good, service is good, and all around good place with their new pricing and menu options. they are open late at night but have a limited late night menu. i believe they still have free food on your bday. mine is tomorrow, so i'm going there for my free breakfast. they also have a special where kids eat free making it even cheaper. i think they've made a tremendous improvement to their food and prices."}
{"text":"I love pumpkin coffee which they offer in menu for holiday season. Hobbit movie theme is exciting. I am going everyday just for that coffee. Hope they have it all the time"}
{"text":"Breakfast started off well. Lorna was friendly and attentive. Quick to bring out water, coffee, and our meals when they were ready. Although the eggs are somewhat cold (the cheese on the eggs doesn't even melt) and the toast barely buttered, that's pretty much the standard at Denny's. But that's where our service ended. No check-ins to see how the meal was, no water or coffee refills. In fact, once we were long done our meals, we noticed we hadn't seen Lorna in quite a while. After about half an hour passed, sitting with our empty glasses and plates, we looked outside and saw her walking back inside from her car. She walked over, smelling like smoke, and asked if we wanted refills. I said no, just the bill please. Lorna went back behind the counter and never came back to our table. Another server came over with the machine about 10 minutes later and remarked, \"where's your bill?\" ... I would love to know! She left and came back with our bill so we could finally leave. Very weird.   We also noticed Lorna's car/smoking room was parked in one of the 10 spots right in front. Nice to make your customers walk around from the far spots in the back."}
{"text":"I generally love Denny's. HOWEVER - we ate there yesterday. The bathrooms were absolutely filty. The cleanest stall was the handicapped stall - which apparently was not used much since there was no toilet paper there. I came out and told the manager the bathrooms were disgusting. She said \"Oh...I'll send someone in.\" we literally sat in our booth for another 45 minutes and no one from Denny's so much as went in to check.   As typical, the food was traditional Denny's - which I like. Their bacon is getting very thin. The waitress was disinterested in us - which I didn't mind because I don't necessarily like hovering waitstaff."}
{"text":"This is NOT your grandmother's Denny's... In fact, this is the COOLEST Denny's I have ever visited in my life....They have a full bar....I guess anything is possible in Vegas....Sit at one of the outdoor tables, you will be right in the middle of the downtown Vegas...which, unlike the Strip, is cool in a unique way...I love it!"}
{"text":"+2 stars are for the friendly cash register/waiter guys that were working the front as you walk in.. Michael and another guy in glasses.  -3 stars for the horrible food  There were maybe 4 tables seated.  It was not busy at all! No excuse for crappy service and screaming in kitchen that I could hear at front door where I was waiting.   To go order.  2 sandwiches  and tater tots. Everything was burnt with the exception of one of the egg ham sandwiches. 2 orders of tots burnt so badly that I don't even think there was any cheese in them and if so,  it didn't survive being burned to death.  Needless to say,  they were so dry they crumbled. All but the 3 attempts to fund good ones but became crumbled ones were dumped out.  Egg, ham, sausage whatever it was called sandwich. Was very burned on the outside and it was way too maple-y, but nay be that is how it's made.. Not sure.  Asked for a side of mayo (3 times confirmed by glad guy) l, so of course it wasn't in the bag when I got home. He even happily told me it was there as he handed me the bag.   May I have my $2 tip back? May i just have the whole bill compensated? So disappointing to waste money like that.    Last time there."}
{"text":"Horrible service and manager! First all we ordered a appetizer cheese fries with no bacon I'm a vegetarian and told the girl this. It comes out not fully melted with bacon I said this was to have no bacon on it to the guy running my food. He literally comes back seconds later with the same cheese fries he picked off the bacon with his hand you could still see bits of bacon in the fries. So at this point I ask to speak to a manager A maybe 30 year old white woman comes out and says what's wrong with these fries I explain to her what happened she rolls her eyes literally and says I'll get you some new ones I told her that's ok I don't want anymore. My girlfriend and I wait at least 15 minutes to get a drink refill. Also a group of four who got there after us left bc they never even received they're first drinks. So our food finally comes out after about 45 minutes Luke warm. The food was just ok not horrible not great. She brings us the check with the cheese fries on the bill so I had to get that taken off. I will never go back and highly recommended you don't either"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Denny's W. Craig with my Mom and our server Shannon was outstanding!! It was very busy but he was very attentive and made it enjoyable through the wait.  Great job Shannon!!!!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast at Denny's two times for breakfast (4am) while in Vegas, food was very good both times and I was able to change my request / substitute with ease and would give the food a 4.5. My service experience was different on both visits, the first time the service was great, helpful and they were ready to serve. My second visit I think I had to wake up the staff when I entered and waited. They were cleaning the windows which was not an issue but I had to ask if the were open.  Overall a great value for a breakfast on the strip"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been to this denny's the first same thing happened. Burnt bacon, sausage and ham. This time it was worse. burnt bacon, sausage, ham, uncooked pancakes and watered down ice tea. Love denny's but never going to this one ever again. Got pictures of the food if i can post it here i will."}
{"text":"Service is beyond bad.  Have currently been sitting down for the past 20 minutes without service. :("}
{"text":"I was surprisingly blown away by the service. The staff was very friendly, the place was clean and even the manager came to each and every table to see how the food and service was. They were just really on the ball.   The server was very friendly, even talked with my kids and laughed and made sure that she stayed on top of my older twos drink refills.   It was really just a refreshing experience. They converted this \"I avoid Denny's unless there is no other option\" person to a \"I will at least visit this Denny's when I am in the area.\"   Food is responsibly priced, fun kid cups and food they will actually eat. :)"}
{"text":"No sense of urgency what so ever. Took 35 min to get water and over 45 min to get our food. Not once did they come and apologize for the long wait. Horrible customer service, I would've probably received better service at the McDonald's nearby."}
{"text":"It's usually great here but definitely depends on the server service and breakfast today was just ok. I was a lil annoyed after having to wait about 30 mins for my food ugh I should've just went with my instinct and left. I will come again and be server specific"}
{"text":"My partner and I came in for a late dinner as we were craving some American food. We ordered an Oreo milkshake to start, which was delicious, but nothing special as far as milkshakes go. My partner ordered the country fried steak - also very delicious, but just a bit above average. I ordered the honey bacon Sriracha burger - not so delicious and I definitely wouldn't recommend it. The flavours just didn't really work together - it tasted quite bizarre. I think I'll stick to the standard fare next time, as that seems to be what Denny's does best."}
{"text":"Good location, good for a cheap breakfast (to compensate for all you spend on dinner around here!). But super slow service."}
{"text":"Waiting to be seated for 6 min will other people walked in and they got seated first.after seated no menu a other 5 min to bring are menu. 10 min to ask for are drink so we just walked out. Still no menu"}
{"text":"Tried calling early in the morning for 15 minutes because to order pick up due to the fact that I had to be somewhere very early and my hotels breakfast started to late for me. Because they never answered, I decided against it and went somewhere else for breakfast."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, we ordered food to go, and after specifically asking if one particular item was in the bag and be assured that it was by the server, it definitely was not.  When we called to ask about having the money for said item refunded to our card, we were told that we could come get it, but they will not refund our money.  Seriously who has time to drive back and forth due to their mistake? And to add insult to injury, when we opened up \"Caesar salad\" that we had ordered vegetarian specifically, it had bacon on it, and the lettuce was half brown. I will never go to this Denny's again. Well at least we know which Denny's in the crappy Denny's in south scottsdale now."}
{"text":"The fact i'm taking the time to write a review. On such a horrible serviced establishment . Waited 10 mins and flagged down an employee to .Get drinks then after waiting 45 mins i went to speak to the manager . He told me i didn't wait that long and pretty much ignored me.Came back with the ticket time and just cut me off .Wasted an hour bad service no food. This is why they barely have business within this chain of restaurants ."}
{"text":"This was perhaps the worst restaurant experience our party of four ever had. Long wait. Breakfast order was really bad. Scrambled eggs were cold with a crust, so you know they were sitting awhile. Bacon was hard and cold. Toast never arrived. Every table around us was also complaining about their order. Manager replaced one meal and discounted the bill 20%. Appreciated, but we just wanted a good basic meal. This dinner was a failure. Would never consider coming back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them zero stars. They are so rude I can not believe they are still in business. We only went there because we were on vacation and not familiar with the area and our Navigation system routed us to this one. I normally go online before picking a place to eat and check the reviews but my family was hungry and we were on vacation. We were sat down by the very nice hostess who got yelled at in front of my family by the soon to be known rude manager. I can't even say how we were talked about by the manager and our server because it would be flagged as inappropriate  and I do not swear because I have manners. Yes you heard it right the server was talking about us to all of her co workers so loud we could hear here and embarrassing as other customers sat there just in shock as we were. Then my family and I were held captured there because I am guessing the manager called the police because I did not want to pay for one of our meals even though it was not eaten because it tasted bad. It is Denny's and we did not expect 5 star treatment but have a little common decency for your customers. I did end up paying for the full bill because I did not want to wait for the police to come to get  one meal taken off and it took forever for the police to come so maybe the police know this restaurant and took their time because of a manager using the police for non emergencies. Oh and we got yelled at by the manager that we must be from LA... Yes she is right we are from LA and I guess we are too demanding to ask to be treated with respect and to pay for food that we can actually eat. Oh the manager told us she was calling the metro all loud in front of everyone... I wanted to tell her the metro is the bus and subway station in LA!! not the police LOL... STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE TREATED BAD AND GET THE POLICE CALLED ON YOU FOR BAD SERVICE..."}
{"text":"Came in the door at 6:11 pm and stood for 10 min. Without even being acknowledged!  And it was far frombusy maybe 16 people inthe wholeplace. Finally the hostess got  us seated and was not very friendly.  Got our fountain cokes and they were all carbonated water and the syrup must of ran out. Told the waitress this and she said she thought they looked that way but never asked about it either!  Ordered or food I got the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes and it was comparable to hospital food!  Potatoes were dry and sticky! Not enough country style gravy for the steak.  My wife got the wrong fries with her burger which she said was bland (suppose to be the Sriracha burger! ) and other smaller details like had to ask twice for silverware and straws. All in all it wasn't terrible but was disappointing!  PLEASE DENNY'S STEP IT UP!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of Dennys. I feel like they have become pretty lackluster since I was a kid but hey it happens. This location is very nice but it could have just been the server, I really need to start remembering names. We were there on a Saturday morning around 9-9:30 for breakfast with the boyfriends mom for her birthday and it was great. It honestly kind of made me change my mind about Dennys. I know there are plenty of breakfast places nowadays but this location knows what it's doing. I got the $4 dollar value slam which I didn't even know existed and it was awesome. 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 pieces of a breakfast meat (I got bacon). If you're in the area and need a quick cheap breakfast I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Denny's, quel merveilleux souvenir gustatif !  Nous avions d√©barqu√© √† deux, vers 22h avec une envie de burger pour ma part, et de salade pour la part de ma maman.

{"text":"I like how Denny's is trying to get hip and attract a younger crowd at night by changing the music exactly at 10pm from elevator to rock.  Even the servers change uniforms - from the standard button down to a black tshirt.    I don't know if it was because I was starving after a long day at work or that their food has genuinely improved, but the food tasted alright to me.  Maybe more than alright.  The hash browns were nice and crispy on the surface and it was great how everything stayed piping hot on the hot plate they served it on.    Service was friendly and professional.  How can you beat the price especially late at night when nothing else in the area is open?"}
{"text":"Food is good but the restroom is dirty. They need to clean it. I try to avoid using the restroom at this location."}
{"text":"The food was terrible - Asked for country syle eggs soft and half was fully cooked. Pancakes were not cooked at the same time as food so they came to the table cold."}
{"text":"After my fiasco at the Denny's down the street (112th Avenue & Grand), we drove here. This Denny's was alright. The staff were friendly; the food was good; and the price is what you'd expect. Again, this place was dusty on the inside. Moreover, my wife sat in a booth where there was a piece of cushion missing. The \"stuff\" inside there was disgusting. All in all, you get what you pay for. It's a lot better than the Denny's down the road (which I would avoid like the plague), but that really isn't saying much."}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday and walked out before I could be seated. The lady at the counter told my family and I that she would be with us in a minute. She then proceeded to go to the kitchen area and talk with a few of her co-workers. Ten minutes went by before my family and I decided on another place to eat. Apparently talking about another co-worker and her \"failure to show up for work\" and \"pull her own weight\" was more important than seating my family. All in all, avoid this place. The place is dusty and dirty on the inside and outside. It needs a makeover with respect to the establishment and staff."}
{"text":"I have lived in this area for long time over 10yrs I only stay about a half a block away, I'm not sure who teaches the cooks but the Denny's Corp office should come visit with a chef to evaluate their performance, I have eaten at this restaurant probably 20 times in 10yrs and out of those I have only had proper food twice:meaning hot,the way I asked for it! the only thing that resembles a good place to eat would be the waitresses one for sure Nikki she is the ultimate but she doesn't cook the food, the 2 stars are strictly for the waitresses other wise No don't eat there!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for Denny's pancakes but wow was this location terrible. I came here at midnight on a Monday night and it was pretty busy. It took a few minutes for someone to seat us which I didn't mind. We were seated in a booth by our server who didn't make us feel welcomed at all.  The inside of the restaurant was just plain filthy. There were tables that weren't wiped, it was dusty, and the floor was sticky with pop that was spilled on the floor that nobody cleaned up.   Our server was not attentive at all. He didn't even look happy to be working there. No smile or nothing. He took our orders, gave us our food (which was the wrong order), and did not check on us once. In addition, when our food was was brought, we did not have any cutlery to eat with for 5 minutes.  The food was pretty greasy. I got the salted caramel & banana breakfast which included hash browns, eggs, and your choice of either sausage or bacon. The bacon I had was really salty and and hash browns had too much oil. The scrambled eggs and pancakes were alright... not the best I had at a Denny's.  Overall, I most likely will avoid this location and dining at Denny's at midnight since it's pretty hectic."}
{"text":"Far none the worst my family and I have experienced in years of going to Denys restaurants service was nearly average the food well below what one  will feed an animal if you wanna make the animal puke and Very very sick  to say that I was extremely disappointed is just an understatement  for the only thing I can write that they were ok are the coffee and fries and that's very kindly to say."}
{"text":"Worst Dennys period.  -bad attitude -horrible food -long wait -they do not even have their attire correct.   Thanks no thanks."}
{"text":"Food was tasty...our server R.Carlos or Carlos R. was the best server I've had in my 3yrs living in Arizona"}
{"text":"Cathy treated us like one of the family. Breakfast was great. Lumberjack slam and American slam was good. Hash browns were the best."}
{"text":"The usual Denny's. Very good prices, very good portion, very good selection. A great breakfast place anytime of the day. Service was a little bit slow on this day but everything up to par as usual. A good experience, will come again. Great location in the middle of the strip."}
{"text":"Breakfast bacon is basically spare to say the least. Otherwise breakfast is ok. Late night is good. Personally I love the Denny's in Boardman, Ohio."}

{"text":"I'm not exactly sure when this location first opened, but some co-workers and I recently headed over to check out the Denny's at Neonopolis. In reality, I'm not a big fan of Denny's, but thought it'd be fun and kitschy.  The Good  It is the nicest, cleanest Denny's that I have ever been in. They have a full bar, which seems interesting for a Denny's, but then again, it's on Fremont Street and that makes sense. I can't comment on the bar because we went for lunch during the work week.  ('Nuff said.)   The restaurant has a photo booth that's Vegas-themed (NEAT); the kind where there's an outline for your head, you stand there, take the picture, and you'll come out with Elvis hair or whatnot. But the camera is kinda high, so if you're a scrimp like me (5' 1\" or shorter), the camera is too high. Sadly, my head didn't reach the outline, and there was no stool or anything like that.  We all had the french toast special, which was cheap ($6-7) and decent (or at least the french toast was; the sausage  . . . well, we won't talk about that). Our waitress told us that they're opening a wedding chapel (or already did), and there was a celebrity wedding already lined up for February. (At least we're already in Vegas for betting purposes.)    The Bad  My group was seated in a booth adjacent to another booth, with some artsy-geometric bars as a separator from the head-up. As we were paying the bill, another co-worker and I turned around in the booth, and noticed a dude's head literally peering over our shoulders through the bars. Apparently, he was looking to see if we were done with our food. Kinda caught us off guard a bit.     The Ugly  It's still Denny's food. Okay / decent, but not great by any means. The general group consensus was that Denny's is a place to end up.  Overall  So why the four stars? Location, location, location! It's Denny's on Fremont, so it's worth checking out for that reason alone. Also, this restaurant has an outside patio, which will be a fun spot to people watch in the summertime, and offers uncommon Denny's menu items like flatbread."}
{"text":"Everytime when we visit the US from Germany we have to go at least once to a #dennysdiner. We really enjoy your restaurants, especially as the food always has a near to perfect price-value-ratio.  Anyhow we unfortunately have to tell you we were quite disappointed today after our visit today at 3397 Las Vegas Boulevard.  We arrived around 9:30 a.m. and where seated quickly. The place was not too crowded at all. Matthew M. \"Matt\" was our service guy of the evening. After we have ordered our first drink and it arrived at our table, Matthew told us he will be right back with \"the rest\". After 5 Mins we started to ask for some straws, as we haven't had any. Furthermore we asked to get some water. Straws were available quite quickly, the water wasn't. Matthew said it was a misunderstanding as he thought we only wanted to have our drink and no further water. This itself would have been ok, anyhow we had to go to the bar by ourself to get some water and bring it to the table later on. Our starter was received without any cutlery. This wasn't handed in before main course (and even there only on request). The food itself was good. We ordered another drink, but had to remind Matthew twice before it arrived. Overall we were not satisfied at all.  It seemed like there were similar situation at the other tables around.   Furthermore we were quite surprised when the check came -\"Matt\" took the right to put a tip of 20%, handwritten by himself, on it.  When we paid at the front desk we asked Crystal to remove it. She was quite surprised and asked us, if we are sure to not give any tip. We wanted to explain why, anyhow she wasn't interested at all, repeated, that \"you do not want to give any tip\". We asked her if she wasn't interested, what made her repeat a third time we are just non-willing to tip.  As written above, this visit at #dennysdiner was not in line with our expectations at all. Instead of enjoying Las Vegas we are now at the hotel..."}
{"text":"Great Denny's The wait staff is right on and they actually care that I want to drink the dark blend and many refills no problem. Never had a bad meal and yeah I eat the fit fare and it's good too! Same lot as Fry's so I can shop after I eat to save money there too. No hassle with my birthday meal and always clean restrooms"}
{"text":"Really nice server, food was great (as always!). They were having the carpets cleaned, so a bit of a wait, but that was just by chance. The server, Hugo, was quick with drink refills, and the food order was very fast!"}
{"text":"Went here this morning with my family as my parents made the trek up to see my son and to celebrate my mother's birthday.  We decided to go to Denny's for breakfast, as it is close and very kid-friendly normally.  When we ordered, my mother stated to the waitress that she wanted the Veggie Omelet without mushrooms, as she has an allergy to mushrooms.  When the food came out, she was a few bites in and discovered a mushroom.  I immediately called the waitress over.  She apologized and took the omelet back.  She brought out another, but roughly half way though, my mother stated that she needed to leave and get Benadryl into her system for her allergy, as her reaction was starting.    I took the bill up and made mention to the cashier that I didn't feel as though we should be charged full price for that item, as the staff had caused the problem themselves.  She got the manager.  The manager then came up very rudely and very coldly and stated that if she was going to have a reaction, she shouldn't have taken the second omelet.  Seriously?  He didn't offer a discount, a voucher.  He didn't offer an apology!?!?  He just asked, quite rudely, that we pay and leave.  That man should not be working in customer service.  If my mother's reaction worsens to the point that she needs medical care, that store could be liable.  And to offer no remorse?  Crazy.  All of this was after waiting 20 minutes to place an order, waiting five minutes for the manager to be able to break away from whatever else he was doing to come talk to me.  Customer service at its very worst.  Avoid this restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"We were here an hour ago for my cousin's graduation supper. It was very disappointed and unprofessional service, along with staff's attitude.   The girl in the front, who told us that she was in charge and refuse to let us to talk to the manager about the service, she didn't know what was going on and how to manage the staffs at all. We got seated and waited for an hour on our order, but every time we asked they said they don't know and will check for us but never come back. The staffs actually ignored us when we asked them about our order. I waved at the sever and said excuse me to get her attention, she did hear us, looked at us, but then ignored and walked away! VERY RUDE AND RACIST!   Finally we decided to give up and walked out to pay for the drinks, the front girl ( from above) gave us attitude because we was not patient enough according to her. We said we waited for almost two hours and no food, so just wanted to pay for our drinks but she kept complaining and mostly likely yelling at us in front of other customers. WORST SERVER EVER! ( the girl with a big mold on her face)   We ended up walked out of the restaurant without paying because she did not even want to help us pay, and still yelling after us.   This location and staffs here deserve ZERO STAR!"}
{"text":"Denny's renovated!   I'm not exactly sure when they did but compared to the previous post and my experience it does look different, I would have picture proof but didn't snap a picture of the diner.  I've been to Denny's before (not this location and before I had Yelp) so the service is nothing new to me. I still like the fact that they are open 24/7 so they can't deny your steak cravings at 3am or if you want breakfast at 10pm.  My girlfriend and I ordered a couple of drinks, an appetizer, and an entr√©e for each of us and yes there is a wait time in between each order but the quality and presentation of each dish was by far 5/5 stars. What I found interesting is that if you ordered the milkshake they give you a metal cup to which you'll get roughly a quarter of leftover milkshake, although it was missing a little cherry on top it was still pretty good. My girlfriend and I agreed that eating the leftover milkshake is better than the milkshake in the glass.  We started off with a half sized nacho, it didn't spark our tastebuds because to us it seemed like any other nachos. The entr√©es however area different story. My girlfriend ordered spaghetti and I ordered a Philly cheesesteak omelet, my omelet was pretty standard - fluffy eggs, well done steak covered with typical Philly cheesesteak veg and a side of shredded hash and your choice of bread. The spaghetti on the other had wasn't what we expected, consisting of three giant meatloaf meatballs, toasted garlic bread on the side and a full plate of spaghetti. The reason why it was unexpected is because usually when she order spaghetti at a couple of different restaurant they served her either a quarter or half a portion versus Denny's full plate.  Overall we were very satisfied and we agreed that we will be coming back soon to try out different dishes."}
{"text":"Good Dennys with decent staff. Sometimes get a rude female waitress, but its whatever. Other than that, great atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"The hostess service is great. The waitress service is very poor. Had to ask twice for water. we were ignored and mocked."}
{"text":"service has always been great. I remember the first time I visited, it was the day of that ludicrous frost in 2014. -42...colder than the North pole that day. on top of that I parked 2 blocks away. Luckily I had some ski gear in my car. so all bundled and with ski goggles on, I felt like an astronaut.  then like a wuss when I saw a little old Asian woman in a dress, coat and nylons. made it there and downed 2 hot chocolates before anything else.  so like I said, the service is always great. the only tiny gripe is the eggs. they taste damp, sunny side up, over medium even scrambled. as if they have some water added. the drinks are too sweet but luckily they usually bring along a cup of ice water with any drink. apart from that, I like it. I like it a lot."}

I also go to the Brookpark location and they are 5 star as well"}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because our server was attentive but it took over an hour to get served. I knew it wasn't her fault and she made sure to keep our drinks filled throughout our wait, however, If you're looking for a late night bite to eat steer clear from this location. I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"I had a surprise birthday party here once and it was absolutely lovely :) Not only was the staff helpful and compliant, but they went above and beyond to make it fun for everyone, from the old to the very young. Thanks for playing along, guys!"}
{"text":"Food is what one would expect at Denny's - not very healthful. (The chicken burrito had much mayonnaise or similar dressing in it - why?) Styrofoam plates and plasticware are easy on kitchen logistics but take away  whatever dining-out joy remains after peeling your shoes off the sticky floor with every step. (I understand the dangers of maple-flavored syrup, but stickiness is my pet peeve. And sugar dissolves so easily in water.)  Iced tea rating: 1/5 stars This barely-tea-colored liquid was indistinguishable from water by taste. (But at least it didn't taste like coffee.) The restaurant seems to possess a standard tea brewing apparatus, so some procedural snafu might be at fault."}
{"text":"Horrible greasy food. Gm didn't care at all when we complained. Management reflects overall very poor experience. My tummy still hurts!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed bad service had to ask someone to at least get our drinks no one ever went by to check if we needed anything they are so unorganized, never again"}
{"text":"I've had better, came here as a group of 5 and we were seated at a round table booth, service started off very nice, halfway through our meal a huge group entered the restaurant and were waiting to be seated. The waitress came to our table as we were eating and dropped our bills off not asking if we wanted anything else prior to dropping the bill and added \"no means to rush you guys\". (Right). ...not even a minute later she shows up with the debit terminal for payment, as we are still eating, and no where near finished. No means to rush my ass. She wanted to give the group our table,  when there were other booths available to seat that large obnoxious party. Won't be coming back if I'm rushed out of a restaurant mid way into eating."}
{"text":"I had one of my worst experiences with any restaurant at the Denny's near Concord Mills mall. When I sat down I had to wait 15-20 minutes for someone to check on me. Mind you I sat right in front of the kitchen. They apologized for the wait and I understood because it was rather busy. The waitress was very kind. I waited for approximately 50 min to an hour for my food. I noticed people who were seated after me or around the the time I got there with food. Needless to say I canceled my order and left after waiting nearly an hour after they to my order."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they are unable to get orders right even 50% of the time. This is not too bad except when you get the food Togo. If you let their Togo staff know there's an issue with the order they become the and blame it on you. The wait staff due sit down service is okay. It's a Denny's..."}
{"text":"Eduardo Rangal  DB manager was TERRIBLE.  Who hired this guy to be a manager??????  The food was delicious and the waitress was amazing.  It's funny how one thing that goes wrong with a meal can say a lot about the establishment.  We ordered a sandwich to go and had placed it on the table with part of our party still chatting.  It was throw out when they cleaned the table and when we went to leave and take it we noticed it was gone.  We spoke to this manager about it and instead of seeing it was a legit grievance, he decided to tell us he would not replace or remove from the bill. When he finally decided to change his mind he had the kitchen make the worst half sandwich I've ever seen.  Terrible, very bad but he definitely showed us who's boss.  Thank you for eliminating this establishment from our morning after church outing Mr. Edwardo Rangel."}
{"text":"I'm a truck driver so, I don't have much choice....... However, I like it to a point...... The price range is not bad..... Neither the food... Well not really.... Overall I'd give 3 stars.... And on the restaurants scale I'd give it 3 stars out of 10."}
{"text":"Dennys is a popular american franchise based on the old style diners. This particulat Dennys is situated on the strip on the side of Casino Royale.    Open 24 hours this diner offers a wide range of breakfasts and dinners. We went almost everyday out of 6 days for breakfast - the pancakes are to die for and are so filling yet so cheap (as most things are). We went one night for dinner and only ordered a Starter each - they were that big!"}
{"text":"dennys is the best chain in the US. This particular one is open 24 hours, but is always busy. Sometimes you have to wait a long time for a table. There is a take-away though, so if you are staying nearby you can alway take it home.    I can never believe how cheap Dennys is and the service is ALWAYS top notch. Have the 24 hour breakfast, the omlettes are amazing!"}

{"text":"0 stars!..I am very disappointed that I walked into dennys to make a to go order with multiple other orders that wanted grits as a side! It's says right on the menu in the section \"sides\", \"grits\". False advertising. Everything is supposed to be served all day and if you want to stop serving it at a certain time it should be labeled on the menu. Also, they are instant none of us can come to any conclusion as to why you couldn't make a very large side order of INSTANT grits. It's midnight and everyone is standing around, doing nothing, and can't make a thing of instant grits..I just don't understand ?????they also forgot the bacon!!! Who forgets the bacon?!?!?!"}
{"text":"This location is clean, the sever is friendly. The food, chocolate chip pancakes were delicious, the fish in my fish and chips were a little over cooked and the portion of fries was a little small that comes with this order. Had the Mac and cheese as a side, which was horrible, avoid this side.  Other wise, a not bad meal and service."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could. The waitress, Felicia, first tells us they ran out of straws. That's fine and understandable. Then I see all other tables around us have bendy straws. If you're out of regular straws, at least maybe ask if we'd like a substitute, instead of flat out stating you're out of straws period. Secondly, she handed me my order with the wrong type of toast. She handed me the food, and said that the kitchen gave the wrong toast, but you're okay with that, right? I'd expect her to at least check with me prior to handing me the plate. Thirdly, as she is going around tables to refill the jam/jelly, as she reaches our table (while we are in the middle of our meal) hands us a packet and asks that we fill the rack for her. It was one packet so it's like whatever, but c'mon really - can't just wait till we're finished? And last, as we received our bill, we noticed that there was a charge for a Bottled Water, which we certainly did not order. Had the lady at the register take it off, and she mentioned that Felicia must have hit that on accident. Mistakes happen, but a double-check of the bill before handing to the customer would be nice. We were debating whether to go to Denny's or a different breakfast joint nearby, and went with Denny's. Our decision should be a lot easier next time. \"Bye, Felicia!\""}
{"text":"I really like this Denny's team. Always nice and actully care about making a hot pot of coffee. I wish this location would get updated to a more modern Denny's soon."}

{"text":"I went with my family yesterday sunday 01/22/17 for dinner. Around 3:30 the restaurant was pretty empty. They took forever to come to the front, to take us to table. Even though the waitress saw us stainding there... When she finally came over all she said was follow me. And walked us to a dirty table. I told her oh its dirty, we'll just sit on the next booth. She didnt like that. She took our drink order and brought back the wrong drinks for me and my husband, my children's were fine. Then she got upset when i asked her to take them back..she brought the new drinks, we put our appetizer order of nachos in at that time. I told her please make sure the sour cream goes on the side, because my husband is allergic. She said ok. And we continue to order. Nachos came with sour cream right in the middle. I told her, this is not how i ordered it. And she tells me. Well thats how they came out. Didnt bother to take them back. I said i would like a new order then, she tells me i will have to charge you for another plate of nachos.we said never mind and just kept that plate. my husbad ate around the sour cream.finally our Food came out. And after that she didnt come back to check on us at all. I had to ask another person for drinks. Then the manager brought our drinks over. I told her what had happened and she just dismissed it by saying was the food good though? I said food is fine but customer service is not. She said okay and left... then about 10 to 15 minutes later the manager came back out to the floor and checked with all 5 tables if they were fine and if they needed anything else? And she never came to my table, i think because we werent white like the other people. Even after all this, we kept calm and never disrespected them.how they disrespected us.  they all avoided our table. We love dennys especially this location. we come at least 1s every week. Never had i had such a bad experience. And what made it worst is that the mananger didnt care about how her employee waw acting. And when i went to the front to pay. The waitress that was assigned to our table i believe her name is ( jenica) that never came by to check on us, had the nerve to ask for a $25 tip.... I was amazed and not in the good way"}
{"text":"Worst Denny's I've ever been to. The cashier was so slow and the staff got our order wrong and we waited for 40 minutes and ended up getting it to go because I was late for work and going to eat it, it was undercooked and gross"}
{"text":"This place is horrible.the service is slow and the food is okay.i would never go back to this place to eat again and they are very unprofessional.i don't think it is appropriate for you to talk loudly to the other servers on how much people tipped you especially when guest can hear you.i should of know better when i happened to see the supervisor and the servers counting there tip in front of the guests and being very loud.very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"A casual place to get breakfast lunch and dinner. The staff is usually nice and they seem to do their jobs well. The food is your usual diner food. Lots of calories and grease. But if you have a hankering for fried food and a milkshake, look no further. This particular Dennys was remodeled not too long ago and it looks very nice inside and out. The bathrooms are usually kept clean as is the rest of the restaurant.  I would say for the staff to try to be a little more personable and cheery to all the customers, keep up on the cleanliness and keep business going!"}
{"text":"It may not be excellent food, but it's one of the only places in Madison open 24 hours, year round, with Christmas and New Years as well.  The food is consistent so you know what you'll be getting.  The restaurant itself looks well taken care of, and my visit was clean.  The decor looks newly renovated and is much better than other Dennys I've been to, both in the area and out of state.  If it's very late it's a decent spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Denny's breakfast and always wish they had one around the South Charlotte area. We were excited to go try it out one evening on our way back from a wedding. We were seriously disappointed. The service was horrible, it took over 30 minutes for someone to even stop by to ask us what we wanted to drink and this was after we stop the person. The food was not up to par either. We ordered our usual nacho which came with cold melted cheese, barely filling the nachos, rarely any meat and I want to say something else was missing in there. The server also mess up on all our  food orders. We were very disappointed and do not expect to go there again."}
{"text":"I love Denny's! I use to go out late all the time and this would be the go to place after a night out. I love their meat lovers scramble. I get that everytime and their pancakes are delicious too!  I'm also in love with their nachos! Definately a great place to go if you're craving breakfast food or just want to meet up for a quick chat. They recently renonvated the place a year or so ago so the place doesn't look as beat up anymore.   I will recommend you go before 1-2am because thats then they drunk party crews stop in to munch. They do have a police officer there during those times so it should be okay for the most part.   The service is always great too!"}
{"text":"We walked in to the restaurant at 3pm. There was maybe 2 tables occupied. We waited ten minutes for someone to seat us. While we were waiting three different employees looked directly at us and ignored us, talking amongst themselves. Once we were seated my daughter sat on the bench and the seat came off and she hurt herself from being stuck between the table and bench.  The waiter laughed amd fixed it, did not apologize or see if she wad okay.  Took our drink orders and disappeared for almost 20 minutes. We ordered our food and waited 45 minutes. While we were waiting no other table recieved their food. One of the waiter touch the food with his bare hands, and food that was ready was left in the window for almost 15 minutes without being taken to the table. We decided to leave without getting our food explained the situation to ome of the servers. He offered to get the manager but came back a couple minutes later saying he couldn't find him. Nobody ever apologized."}
{"text":"Wow! This location has really gone downhill. We have been coming here since I was a teenager and never had an experience like the one we had last night. First off, our poor waitress. Only 4 days on the job and having to take the brunt of her co-workers and manager's bad choices. My mother, daughter and I came last night after I got home from work and not really feeling up to cooking. We live to come here as we generally know what to expect. Apparently not last night.. First, we stood waiting for someone, anyone to seat us. Eventually I sent my daughter to look for a table and then sent them to sit while I continued to wait. When the greeter finally got around to noticing the backup at the door, she tried to seat the group behind me. At which point one of the ladies in the group told her to help me first. Thank gawd. I probably would have just gone off. I grabbed some menus and followed my family. The waitress was at our table a few minutes later, taking our drink orders.  Now, I will admit my family, my mother especially, are picky eaters. As any new waitress will tell you, write down picky orders. Ours was smart enough to do this and saved her tip!! Everything was kewl till our food was delivered. The greeter brought our food over as the waitress was quite busy, otherwise it might not have reached our table wrong. My mother ordered the chicken fried steak with gravy. The only unusual thing about her order was she wanted brown gravy instead of the country gravy. When it arrived with the wrong gravy, she sent it back. Both my daughter and I finished our food, and I went to the restroom and out for a cigarette before they brought out my mother's food.. So a good 45 minutes.. for something that would take less than 10 minutes to make. And what they brought.. my daughter sent me a text with a pic that had me rushing back from my cigarette. They had brought her the exact same plate of food, minus the gravy.. which they literally just scraped off and flipped the chicken fried steak over and reserved. Now, remember, it's been 45 minutes!!  So this plate of food sat in the kitchen for 45 minutes and was then served to a customer. Can you guess who was in the kitchen this entire time? That's right, the manager!!  I felt awful for the waitress, none of this was her fault. She took the order correctly.  We had my mother's order removed from the bill, but I have to yelp this.  It was just so ridiculous, and for a restaurant manager to send it out himself was just appalling."}
{"text":"The guy that helped us was very nice and polite and we got greeted as soon as we came in...very great service and food was really good.."}
{"text":"This place is a joke..horrible service..ghetto and why are the people in the back the whole time doing nothing but standing around looking like idiots...we didn't get greeted or even a hello, just a response on how many and what table would you like..really, really, oh and it took 30 min to get food which they are fully staffed, makes no sense to me."}
{"text":"Good service, horrible bacon, good eggs, horrible toast, very expensive. Wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"If there was a rating less than one star that's what I would rate my experience here! After a night out with my sister, we were hungry and stopped for food at Dennys. When we walked in the woman who greeted us was extremely rude. No hello, how are you, welcome to Dennys, good morning... Nothing. Instead we get \"how many?\" We told her three and she proceeded to grab menus and walk away never telling us to follow her. The three of us assumed And followed her over to a table. She then got our drink orders. All of us ordered water. About ten minutes later she. Brings us the water in glasses that loom like they weren't cleaned for days! When we addressed the issue she said all of them look like that they're clean. We shrugged it off and decided not to drink anything there. She got our food order nearly 45 minutes later, the food came out rather quickly, and tasted just fine. Never once did the woman come over to check on us. She was to busy chatting with a man in another section. We waited 23 minutes gk get our check, and when she brought it over she slapped it down on my sisters phone which was lying on the table. All three of us work in the service industry. And this is no way to treat a laying customer. We were disgusted and can garuntee that we will never be back there."}
{"text":"What has happened to this Dennys,food used to come out fast and good.had a great manager who is no longer there and replaced by someone who has no control. Food taking 30 to 40 minutes, place looks dirty and not enough help.you have lost my business"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money here. My party of 3 came in on a Thursday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't very busy and had to wait almost an hour after ordering for our food. People who had been seated after us had already finished eating by the time we were served.  I did not recognize the super bird sandwich I always order when it was served. The sandwich was tiny and hardly warm, the bread barely toasted and soggy with butter. The cheese was unmelted and the sliver of tomato looked like it had been sliced 5 hours ago and sat in the sun. The worst part was the meat, instead of thin deli meat I was given a single thick slab of burnt dry turkey dinner meat and 3 tiny burnt pieces of bacon no longer than my little finger. It looked like they had pieced it together from someone's leftovers.  My husbands spaghetti was served cold with very underdone noodles. The appetizers still had not been served by the time we decided to save ourselves the stomach ache and grab some fast food, because taco hell couldn't be worse than what we were served. Don't waste 2 hours of your vacation on this mess."}

The third day omg it was horrible we had two different waitress to help us  cold coffee refills we had a hair in our food ask to speak to the manager we had to wait until we got the check to find out why the manager was never called a waiter name Terrance came to help us who said he was doing a favor ... Horrible service ..... Never again at this Denny next to casino royale.."}
{"text":"I stop in at this Denny's location from time to time, usually when taking my wife to the airport. I have always had great service and food. Today I stopped in after taking my to the airport and ordered my breakfast. Before my food was served, I noticed that I did not have my wallet with me. I went and talked with my server whose name is Martinka and told her of my situation and told her I could leave now and go get my money and she said no way, go eat your breakfast and we will work it out later. After eating my breakfast I told her that I would go home and get my money and be right back. She said not to worry that breakfast was on her and that I could stop by anytime to repay when I was in the neighborhood. I said no way and left to go home to get my money and returned and paid for my breakfast. Martinka was an outstanding server and a great ambassador of how customer service should always be handled. This Denny's location is extremely fortunate to have her as an employee and I will return here and recommend this location to many people many times. Thank you Martinka and thank you Denny's."}
{"text":"What has happened to this Denny's.  Always preferred their breakfast.  Went there this AM.  Saw the waitress twice, once to take our order and once to get the bill.  One cup of coffee, never offered a second.  Guess I will stick to Cracker Barrel from now on."}
{"text":"Always enjoy a good breakfast, fast and friendly service like always. Food was great. Today i had the Blue berry pancakes with eggs bacon and hash browns."}
{"text":"Relative to your average Denny's or other franchise breakfast joint, this spot is fantastic. No, the food isn't Michelin-star rated because you know, it's a Denny's. But, the wait staff, hosts and hostesses were all fantastically friendly and brightened up our mornings, and there's a lot to be said for that."}
{"text":"Nicest Denny's I've ever been to. Attentive staff. Typical Denny's food. Not much more you can ask for."}
{"text":"First off we love Dennys and this was our 4th visit to this one we have gotten bad food here before but cooks do have bad days but 4 times..The eggs were under cooked and pancakes tasted old and dry and the rest of the plate had a puddle of grease I think the only thing good was the toast and coffee..All the other Dennys we get good food and good service so I think its time to get new cooks and new servers cause you keep this up and the dennys name wont save this place"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you in my day-to-day I am a caregiver. Let me just say Sherry our waitress is exempt from anything said, if it weren't for her, this place would have negative points. I am not sure what's going on in the managers head but one particular bus boy head shaved with four braids popping out of his hat, was a little crude in front of my patient. At one point all I could do is glare."}
{"text":"Out this Sunday morning doing a bit of GeoCaching, we decided breakfast was in order so where to go? I-Hop or Denny's ... Ok we decided on local so off to Denny's.

Service was great & food was good ...  Service: 4 star, our waitress was great, fast & friendly Ambiance: 2 stars, casual setting, a bit dated Cleanliness:  3 stars, appeared clean although lots of water spots on the glasses Food: 3 star, food came out hot and well prepared Price: 3 star, fair price's, my wife had a BYO Grand Slam for $6.59 and I had an All American Slam for $8.89"}
{"text":"For a resturant that is right on the strip, this place was NO DICE. Service was subpar, the servers seemed rushed and flustered at all times and food was... well the same as the rest so I guess that's a plus."}
{"text":"We have not been to this Denny's in a long time due to the horrible service and understaffed. Tonight was no different, waited over a hour and still no food. We ended up cancelling our order and going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here today with my 8 year old daughter. The server was extremely friendly and asked my daughter how Christmas was and if she got lots of presents. This kindness goes a long way in how you enjoy the atmosphere. She took our order and customized a meal for my daughter as she is picky. Within 10 minutes we were eating and the food was excellent. I will not hesitate to go back here again and recommend this location."}
{"text":"Shoutout to the previous reviewers who think this is a reservation restaurant or something. It's a Dennys - it's cheap, fast and generally pretty good.  Is it the best food in the world? No, but it's pretty much what you can expect for the price in an establishment like this. Only slight complaint is the one server seemed very overworked but he managed to get the job done.  After you leave you can walk into the casino and inhale about a thousand cigarettes. It's a win win to be honest, Strip restaurants eat your heart out."}
{"text":"This was yet another disappointing visit to Denny's. I have been to several in CA, and now one here in AZ. I won't be coming back to any. This One was way under staffed, food was horrible, coffee was nasty, eggs were more cheese than eggs, toast wasn't even toasted. Took for ever to get our food. Thanks but No thanks!! The only reason I have them two stars was because they staff did try, but there was just not enough of them. Did get an apology , but still not enough."}
{"text":"Please order from another Denny's if that is what you really want. I ordered through GrubHub and my order was incomplete. The restaurant insisted that we were lying and all meals had been double checked. The food that did make it was messy and half of the food was spilled inside the bags. Never again. Food isn't even that good."}
{"text":"Best Denny's so far we both ordered the invisible woman breakfast the price was okay.  My eggs came out pefect my wife's as well, the pancakes were perfect the server was great (Merced) he checked on us twice.  Only one down point which wouldn't merit a decrease in stars, it's getting in out.  If you're coming from the west you'll have to go under the overpass and make U-tune.  This Denny's has the Ihop just down road totally beat in service, cleanliness and food quality.   I hope, if you choose this particular Denny's you will enjoy it as much as we did."}
{"text":"Service is the worst about this place. They would get a 4 star rating if it was average. They take forever to get drinks and take your order. I've walked out of this place twice, and never to because it's rude, so, that's saying something. There food is pretty decent and a lot of their servers are friendly. It's kind of jammed and the setup feels crowded. I have no problem with their food, it's pretty good. What you'd expect out of a cheap diner."}

They honestly do not know what they are doing here it's a S**t show . They continue seating people down knowing they cannot keep up with demand . If I can give 0 stars I would. Best advice I can give this place, SHUT IT DOWN......!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Idk what is going on with Dennys . They are hiring some unprofessional employees. I completely understand you have to lower your standards due to the lack of work ethic this new generation offers , but come on now!!! can u at least hire employees with hospitality not ATTITUDE!  I walked into this Dennys at 11:30ish am decided to give this dennys a try after exiting other Dennys on i17 and dunlap because we waited for 2 hours and didn't get any food . So decided to leave that Dennys to give this one a try . But oh my was that a mistake . Me , my wife and son walked in to simply ask how long the wait time was after having a horrible experience at other location as we walked in chunky girl hostess was yelling at customers with some sassy attitude  quote \" IS EVERYONE SIGNED IN IS EVERYONE SIGNED IN!!!!!!!\" unquote.  Right then and there I knew this was going to be a horrible experience . My wife approached her and she immediately said are you signed in are you signed not giving my wife room to ask her how long the wait was unfortunately due to her lack hospitality we decided to walk away . My simple solution  to fix this problem is to fire this Girl or any other of your Co workers with attitude . Unfortunately , people hate there jobs and this is the perfect example of it . I've worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years and this is no way to speak or treat any customers PERIOD! Will be taking my business and money to IHOP  from now on ."}
{"text":"Nov 23 2015_9 am - this denny's was amazing, the staff was friendly the food was great,  and my waiter was great he kept checking to make sure my food was to my liking and my coffee cup was always full. This was also the first time I seen a full bar in a denny's."}
{"text":"Went there because Chilis was too crowded, only regret was they didn't serve beer. The staff was great and the food was delicious. I had the California Club and don't remember what my wife's sandwich was called. This was our first time having dinner there."}
{"text":"Called ahead to ask if they had gluten free pancakes.  The lady that answered the phone hesitated, but said she thought they did.  She then asked someone standing nearby and the answer I got was yes.  I specifically said again, you have gluten free pancakes right?  Yes, again was the answer.    We get there and I'm pouring over the menu looking, but can't find.  They do have Gluten free friendly menu where you have to look for a micro-sized icon to denote the gluten free dish.  The only thing I could find beyond obvious items that don't contain Gluten was English muffins.    The waitress was appoligetic and said she would mention it to the manager.  I would have liked a visit from the manager to tell me that they would make sure the staff was educated in giving the correct answer next time someone phones ahead, but the visit never came.  If I was a gambler in Vegas, I'd bet she never said a word.  I'm going to call ahead again tomorrow to see what answer I get.  Anyway, besides the gluten, this was the worst Denny's experience my family has ever had.  Denny's is famous for \"Cheap\" food, but I kept wondering how in the world do they slice the bacon so thin that you can barely see it.  They ran out of coffee and so the refill came long after the wife wanted it.  I will say, besides the poor service and overall food quality, the gluten free english muffins were good.  Bottom line is we ussually goto Denny's a few mornings while in vegas because of the prices on the stip being so high.  This was the first and last time I'll ever goto this location.  We've been to the other location on LV blvd...up from the strip and had a good experience there."}
{"text":"Mr. Shannon is by far the greatest definition of customer service! Not one thing was off! His attentiveness, sense of humor, involvement of all persons in my family! Even our 5 year old was laughing with him! Hands down the best experience at a Denny's ever! Shannon is a huge asset to you and you're movement! God bless you Shannon and thank you so much for your sense of humor and attentiveness!   Sincerely,    Jayson"}
{"text":"I Love Denny's restaurants just NOT  the ones in LV (this one and the other one on north end of strip). It's BAD!!!!!!! You have to wait for too long to get your drink plus the food.... It's NOT CLEAN...!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Denny's for many, many years. I have never had a bad meal here but I have had a couple of crappy servers. A lot of times their servers don't know things they're supposed to know such as what's on special, substitutions, what comes with what etc...the only servers I will deal with there are the experienced ones that I know are competent and know what they're doing. There is one particular server at this place that I avoid like the plague; she is a total dud and is the rudest person ever. She doesn't need to be named LOl"}
{"text":"This Denny's location has hit rock bottom.  On our recent visit, we were seated where we said we didn't want to sit, the appetizer was served after the entree, both entrees were not prepared correctly, and the cashier didn't know how to process a credit card.  To make matters worse, the manager asked us if we had specified whether we wanted the appetizer BEFORE the entree!  This location is sorely in need of a new manager who knows how to train cooks and cashiers."}
{"text":"The service needs improvements! We went there for a late night meal, the food was not bad. After waiting approximately 30 mins for our food to arrive, the waiter ended up saying that the kitchen made a mistake with our orders which is the reason for the delay. When the food finally arrived, the sever forgot to give us utensils and also never checked up on us. In the end, we had to wait another 20 mins for the bill.  The only pro is the fact that Denny's are opened 24 hours."}
{"text":"This place was okay nothing special but hey there open all night so why not right. Laser tag now this it's pretty great"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this Denny's for years. The service is always the same, good. I like the consistency and this place has it. I usually get something different every time I'm here and it's always good. The parking lot is clean, the restrooms are clean and of course the inside of the restaurant is clean. I would recommend this Denny's to my friends and family."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour just for a couple of burgers and the food gave my wife food poisoning. I called later to speak to a manager, and was told that the Mgr. would call me back. It has been a week, and the mgr. never called. We will never go back there. Food poisoning is very unpleasant, and wouldn't wish it on anyone. Wish I could give this place zero stars. This is the Denny's at Craig & Valley."}
{"text":"I rate Denny's a 0 out of 5 and please read why. Denny's is that go-to place for any and every occasion. Breakfast, lunch, after church or graduation, and in this case after a night out at the bars and clubs. It was early March 9th at 2:30 a.m. after just hitting several bars and we were starving so we decided to stop at Denny's. It was Yaeko, Jimmie, Rico, and I. I ordered the grits and some other sides. To make a long story short the waitress brought the grits out as i then salt n peppered it. I then took my fork out to fluff my grits over and a wire about 1/2 inch thick and 2 inches long came up from under. I flipped out, got sober after flipping out, and then lost my appetite. Everyone's meals was on the house but i was too pissed to even order anything else. That was the last time and will be the last time i ever step foot into another Denny's, EVER. People, please, i encourage u and advise u to bring a metal detector if u ever go to Denny's."}
{"text":"Open 24/7, when you are making your way back to your hotel at sunrise there is nothing better then the pancakes. PLus for all the mine sweepers out there, you can have an unlimited amount of food for free. People come in have one bite of their food and leave being under the influence. You go in, wait your turn and have as much food as you can imagine. Photo link: http://s15.postimage.org/nh3us4ntn/288_28354816205_354_n.jpg"}
{"text":"Raw pancakes, onions in my eggs, and having to move to another table because I I am under 21 and the seater wasn't bright enough to catch it when we walked in. What a great way to start my vacation..."}
{"text":"Before eating here, I spent a few hours walking up and down the strip under the oppressive summer heat. It was about 4pm, too early for dinner but too late for lunch, when hunger pangs were starting to kick in. I kicked back at this Denny's, located right across the street from the Mirage.   The food was fresh and portions generous, the waiter was friendly, and the tables were clean.   However, the service was very slow. Not the slowest I've ever had, but 15 minute wait for your soup/salad/appitzer slow.   Bottom Line: Go to Denny's if you want to eat; go to the Mirage or Wynn's buffet if you want to dine."}
{"text":"This diner is simply the best. You don't go to a diner for 5 star food. You go for good food like how mom used to make, and you go for the service. The moment I walked in the hostess greeted me with a genuine smile and offered me a seat at my preferred booth. The server was fast and friendly. You can always tell a restraints quality by how often you see the manager. The manager was in the dining area filling drinks and delivering food the entire duration of my visit. This is a recurring experience. I'm in this dennys doing homework and enjoying a meal at least once a week. I'm glad I finally am able to give them credit for their many jobs well done!"}
{"text":"Went in to have late dinner with my three kids. I also ordered a to go order for my husband. All food was on the house do to a Very very Very long wait.. I don't ever complain, but when three other family came after us , ate there food and left then I decided to let the AWSOME manger know. Only because he noticed we were waiting, and he asked... I'm very appreciate of his kindness. #1 MANAGER! BIG THANKS FROM MY FAM!"}
{"text":"schnelles und einfaches Essen. Nette Kellner. Obwohl man laut Ratgeber die Ecke des Strip meiden soll, da sie sich hinter dem Stratosphere Tower befindet. Das andre Denny's mitm aufm Strip ist mehr als gut besucht, egal ob von Sweet Sixteen, Junggesellenabschiede oder einfach nur hungrigen M√§ulern"}
{"text":"I was craving comfort road-food. Grateful to have a Denny's open nearby. For all it's imperfections, I appreciate the hours they keep. I ordered a plain iced coffee which was more like coffee-flavored half & half. Guess people like it that way. Well, not me!  I particularly didn't like it when a waitress came to my table with a plate of food, held it out and asked, \"is this yours?\"  It wasn't. When she did bring out the correct order it felt like a game (I didn't want to play.) The food was salty to cover up an overall lack of flavor and the flies were happy to have a plate to circle as I pushed it to the side.  As I waited to close my check I wish someone would have come taken the plate away. It was making me sick.  I know it's a glorified diner, so I shouldn't expect a whole lot. I like Denny's as a chain. I simply wish I could say my experience at this store was better."}
{"text":"Where do I start with this place I came in on Mother's Day 5-14-17 an encountered one of the most disgusting human beings in my life \"SHANNON\" I watched this guy talk about people of ethnic backgrounds like they were not of his standards to have at his tables maybe you should be more focused on being a positive person. And the second thing I witnessed this guy doing he pick up the phone after it was ringing for what seemed like forever and said \"hi this is dennys on Craig we are on a 45 minute wait we are not doing to-go order and we do not do reservations\" and then hung right up on who ever was on the other end. It blows my mind with so many people out there looking for work that this is the standard that DENNYS is willing to accept. This guy should look for work out of the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"While staying at a hotel near-by, we picked up a take-out order at this Denny's.  While the staff seemed very frazeled on this particular evening even though the restaurant was not busy.  A tossed salad was missing from my order so I had to return to the restaurant to retrieve it.  (Fortunately, I checked my order before leaving the parking lot.)  I had already added my usual gratuity when picking up this take-out.     When I returned for my tossed salad, it had not been put into the take-out container as yet and I had to wait while the person who had filled the other part of the order ran around doing other chores.  This person, then, proceeded to put the salad together.  This person did not bother to wash their hands or put gloves on before dipping their bare hands into the bag of salad fixings!!    UGH!!!!    Because I was in a hurry  because the rest of our dinner was getting cold, I did not register a complaint with the manager who was on duty.  But, needless to say, the salad was quickly pitched into the garbage can back at our hotel!   I don't think I will every return to this Denny's and am sorry to have to say this."}
{"text":"Value meals... that's where it's at for cheap eating, as long as you're not looking for healthy.  And egg, biscuits and gravy for $2.  You know it's cheap when your tea costs more then your meal.   I wouldn't call it a good meal by any means, but if you're broke on the strip from plugging all your $ into an one armed bandit, it'll fill the hole in your gut (but not your soul... it's a lost cause). But... free wi-fi!  Hard to find on the strip."}
{"text":"Manager had us sit down and then gave us dirty looks the whole time cause they got a big party making us feel rushed"}
{"text":"Worst Dennys in the southwest! The food was smothered in grease and the pancakes had left over char from past cooked food! Oh and I didn't get silverware until I was seated."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. This is the third time I come have dinner and I leave angry. First time I came here a lady sat us down. We waited 10 minutes and no one ever came to even offer us a drink. So me and my husband got up and left. Second time same thing we went for dinner and again slow service no refills cold food and the manager was so out of it. She offered me a refill and never came back with it. Last night was the worse I ended up cancelling my food. I got mozzarella sticks and they were under cooked. So were the onion rings. Our food took at least 45 minutes so I told the manager I didn't want my spaghetti anymore she didn't bother to ask why or what was the issue. We never got one refill. We asked for a check the waitress said she'd go get it 10 minutes pass by and she's somewhere at another table taking orders when we had been waiting for our check. I'm not ever coming back to this restaurant. The Dennys down the street has way better service. And food. Check #473892 Server: Anne"}
{"text":"A half hour wait a sandwich when the place is not busy. Unacceptable. Add in the 10 min  wait that  we were acknowledged when we first walked in. The food was disgusting in top of it. Raw fries and burnt turkey"}
{"text":"We arrived at Dennys around mid morning (11am). We ended up waiting for about 10 minutes, but they were moving people in and out really fast. When we were seated we were not only greeted by the hostess and waitress, but also the bus boy and the runner...which is basically another waiter for a really busy restaurant. We ordered and recieved our food fast and hot. It was just what I needed after a night of drinking. Our waitress was wonderful. We asked about other types of foods and where to get inexpensive stuff and she told us a bunch of amazing places that we will definitely end up going to again."}
{"text":"I would not give this place even one star but I guess you have to give it something to write a review. I went the tonight about 6:20pm. I ordered two different burger plates for take out. The young lady taking my order asked me if I wanted to put my tip on the card. I said NO. I am not tipping for take out. She got a lil attitude then. She said it would be 10 to 15 min.. At 6:45 asked another waiter if he could check on my food. He comes out of the kitchen and goes and finds the waitress that had taken my order. She then says to me that I didn't have my food because they only had one cook. WHILE I WAS WAITING A FEW OTHER PEOPLE CAME IN GOT SEATED AND WERE SERVED THEIR FOOD. WHILE MINE STILL WASN'T DONE. Another lady came in at this time and paid for a order she had called and placed on the phone. She waited 15 min. before coming to the restaurant and they hadn't started making her food either. I then asked the manager for my money back and she said they couldn't refund my money back on to my credit card. Well that is a CROCK OF POOP. I did get my refund back on my card and I will never go to this Denny's again."}
{"text":"I give it a stat just because I have to give at least one. I went to \"edc\" and it ends at 5 am so we go to dennys to have some breakfast, theres was only two booth occupied. There was a mexican chef named Rodrigo who was cursing out loud in spanish. I'm mexican so I understood everything he was saying, the waitress even came to say that she was sorry, that she didn't knew what he was saying but that she was sorry. When the food was finally at our table (45 minutes later and without people) all our food was burned, the hashbrowns, potatoes, pancaques! I do not wish bad for anyone but if anyone pays for a service we should receive a decent service. I hope the people from corporate do something about this, because I can not believe that a franchise such as denny's would hire someone like that \"chef\"."}
{"text":"Don't go here!  Worst experience ever!  Wish there was a portion of a star because they don't even deserve the one.  The wait wasn't  bad for a Sunday morning,  but after being shown to our table we didn't see our server for almost 20 minutes.  Got the attention of the hostess as she was sitting other customers and before we could even say what we wanted,  she tells us our server will be right with us.  She must have known!  Still took another 10 minutes for our server to \"appear\" only to put her finger up and tell us she'll be right with us.  I must've had a look on my face that said \"you've got to be kidding me\" so she DOES come and take our order.  We think GREAT,  now it will be ok. No such luck. When we get our coffee,  we need sugar but there isn't any on the table.  Rather than wait some more,  I ask other wait staff for sugar and they tell me to ask my server.  I tell them she's non existant. Finally someone sees me standing around and is nice enough to get me some.  Now we're waiting on our mimosas that we ordered.... about 40 minutes ago.... and also want more coffee.  When our food finally arrives,  we tell her we would like more coffee,  also need more creamer,  and would like butter for our breakfast breads since they were both dry.  Good luck on that!  How about one out of our three requests?????? Once again,  I ask other staff for butter and am told to ask my server.  Good lord, I've never been so aggravated at a breakfast restaurant.  And the sad thing is it wasn't just us.  All the other tables around us were experiencing the same thing.  That was the only thing we could chuckle about - listening to other customers around us and their moaning and grumbling!!! Oh, one more thing.  A serving tray stand feel onto the floor,  in the path of where everyone walks,  and the hostess STEPS over it as she's seating customers.  So does a busser!  They didn't pick it up or move it,  they STEPPED over it. Crazy!"}
{"text":"It's Denny's. The food is consistent with the other Denny's locations I've been to and the staff is pleasant. What more is there to expect?"}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Went for breakfast at the counter and ordered a simple breakfast with hash browns. Asked for the hash browns to be well done and mixed all the way thru.  They came out barely cooked.  I complained once and they brought out a plate of hash browns that were sitting on the counter with one side dark and 90% of the hash browns still not cooked.  Just disgusting so me and my wife walked out. Paid for what I ate. They didn't even care as to what was wrong.  Place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Wer einfach unkompliziert etwas zu sich nehmen will, ist bei Dennys genau richtig. 24h am Tag ge√∂ffnet und alle Speisen werden serviert. Bedienungen sind sehr freundlich, auch Sonderw√ºnsche werden unkompliziert umgesetzt. Die St√§rke liegt eindeutig beim Fr√ºhst√ºck, die Milchshakes sind allerdings auch sehr zu empfehlen!"}
{"text":"Too long of a wait when empty tables are available. The server was pleasant, but seemed overtaxed. The food (chicken broccoli Gouda skillet) was tasty but a little salty. Avoid this place on Sunday mornings due to the wait."}
{"text":"Also affectionately referred to as Jenny's by some of the locals (never said inside Denny's), is a great place to go 24/7 when you and the guys are done going to Amsterdam or Charlie's. The food is nothing special (nor the inside) but the atmosphere and the employee's really make this a place to come and be seen."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Customer service not great.  Person I paid didn't even smile or say hello just put hand out.  No refill of drinks."}
{"text":"Place smells so bad. Went in with my husband and the awful smell hit us right at the enterance. We waited and got seated but our table and seating were quite filthy, and the eating area smelled even worse than the enterance.  We got up and left without ordering because it would have been hard to keep the food down."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner, about 12:45 LOL, and my family and I were promptly seated by a nice employee. We were sat down, asked for our drinks, and even though they took a while to get them, had a really good dinner! We saw the manager and she looked like the sweetest lady you could ever meet, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Really dirty and yucky, bland food. From where I was sitting I could see back towards the kitchen/food prep area. There was trash all over the floor back there.  I'm not being dramatic when I say this, my food and my child's food tasted like vomit.   Please avoid this place."}
{"text":"I am a Denny's fan but this one has been the worse experience ever. Food was bland and despite ordering a well cooked egg it came runny, I asked for it to be properly cooked and when it came back it was fine but the rest of the plate was cold, not to mention it took forever to get the food in the first place.   Service was almost non existent and the server would disappear for long times as well despite the place not being busy."}
{"text":"I've stopped here a number of times for breakfast and always got good service. Food is affordable and very good."}
{"text":"If you got to this Denny's get only Austin or Michael and I guarantee your service will be great!"}
{"text":"Yuck! Poor food and poor service. We waited for a table and the manager kept going outside to smoke so he totally wreaked of cigarettes. Got a chicken salad and the lettuce was as brown as the chicken."}
{"text":"This was cold mash potatoes and they gave me a dry piece of salmon the cusomer service was a 7 out of 10 the food was a 3 out of 10"}
{"text":"Ah, Denny's. What can you say? The last resort late at night for a decent meal. We came here one night after a large win at a local casino and spent some of our winnings on their all day breakfasts. It was pretty standard except for the potato/hash brown/shreddings. Had I known they would serve me shredded potatoes, I would have called for something different. What is the deal with these things in this province, anyway? Every breakfast house tries to pawn these off on their customers. It's like eating dirt. Why can't we have the old fashioned potato wedges cooked and grilled the old fashioned way? There was nothing wrong with that way. It must be cheaper for them to shred the things. That way we don't know if they're good potatoes or not. We can't really taste them when they're chopped into little sheets of what should be potatoes. I hope Denny's takes a leadership role here and brings back the old way and makes it standard on all their breakfast dishes. Even late at night after a few beers, we can tell the difference. Other than that our server, who has one of the worst serving gigs in town, handled everyone at the place with great patience. I think these poor women are abused more than not by surly loners late at night, but she handled it well and it was a good experience. Except for the potatoes...."}
{"text":"Denny's has good food at reasonable prices and they seem to have the efficiency thing down. The food is always consistent and I've never had a bad meal here.  This Denny's gets busy on the weekends, but the wait is never long and you know you'll get decent food quickly. Except the apple juice. Why the hell are they charging $4 for a glass of apple juice? There is no justification for this.  But outside of that, the food was good and the service was prompt. You can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Wow its FREEZING in this place!  If ur looking for bang for your buck--its not here.  My waitress was very pleasant, attentive, and seemed to have it together but I can't say the same for everyone else.  Lots of confusion and wrong orders.  2 waitresses complaining that they got slammed--this place didnt have more thank 6 tables occupied at 1 time.  Rolled silverware was dirty.  I used to regard Dennys as a nice place to go but these days I'm reminded of a dive diner."}
{"text":"Here after ages!! I opted for banana pecan pancake breakfast, and asked them to substitute the turkey bacon with fruit bowl. The server tells me it will cost 69 cents extra, as fruit is more expensive than meat!"}
{"text":"Cockroachs running on the tables, burgers were pale. Not so tasty. Needs major change in management. I like other dennys. But not this one."}
{"text":"Went into Denny's to get my all you can eat pancakes once out of the year for Veterans Day and got denied.  Apparently they already have deeply discounted menu options like there value slam, so they disregard there promise of all you can eat pancakes on Veterans Day(only Denny's near me)"}
{"text":"Everyone in the front of the house is yelling at everyone in the back of the house man on the grill is way over worked."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this Denny's. I normally like Denny's for breakfast but the quality of the breakfast was poor and very Bland. I ordered the All-American slam and a stack of pancakes. The pancakes were very good but the All-American slam was flavorless. When I walked in and nobody was at the register and several employees just passed by me and didn't say anything. Took about 3 minutes to get a seat. This place was not clean at all and my coffee cup had stains on the inside. My bill was $15.57 which is really high for a bland  meal with a dirty coffee cup. My waitress Rita what is nice and efficient but she should have noticed the coffee cup. Won't be going back there"}
{"text":"Service is horrible. The host was extremely rude and with attitude making comments about people's name. I have asked to talk to manager and her coworkers were pretending to be managers - host name is Karen Hispanic female."}
{"text":"Best Denny's I have ever been too! The food is always fresh. Arnulfo is the best employee there!! This place is always consistent."}
{"text":"Walking in and not being greeted is on of my all time pet peeves. Anyone working in the restaurant business should know that greeting is extremely important - yet not here. The staff is extremely rude and not helpful. The staff service makes the food worse (somehow it always relates, right?). Greasy and sickening. I'd rather avoid the hour long wait for a bad experience."}
{"text":"Horrable service. Been sitting here. Its been a half hour. Lets see if the food is good and warm."}
{"text":"It's Denny's.  Moderate service, good cheap food.  24/7.  They have remodeled this one and it looks very nice."}
{"text":"Awful service, waiter got our order wrong several times and all they had to say was, \" I know \". Food was okay, not very warm almost like it had been sitting out for a while and they just brought it to our table."}
{"text":"WORST, WORST,WORST Denny's I have ever been to. It took 53 minutes to deliver our food to our table. When it finally arrives... The knives they gave us were DIRTY!!!!!! Literally DIRTY! like if they have never washed them. Then I called the manager to complain and what she says... Oh, I' sorry about it.  Then because of the horrible service I got... I did not leave any tip, and the waiter complaints about me not leaving a tip!!!!  I will never be back !!!! EVER!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would or even negative stars.  We have only been to this place a few time cause ever time we come in we have the worst service. Today. We walked in got seated and the lady was nice and got our drinks then said your server will be right with you. We waited about 10 minutes then I got up and asked if we had a server. The reply was no one saw you.  Really they were cleaning the tables in front of us. Never again.  This place a NASTY and people are very rude"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst experiences I've had in a long time. We arrived at 12:55 waited until 1:15 before anyone even acknowledged our table. The waitress Lourdes finally comes over after BSing with another coworker and says I have to stop off somewhere and I'll be right back. I said we haven't even gotten drinks yet and been here 20 minutes. She said I will do it all at once. WHO DOES THAT???!!! There is all of 5 tables occupied and it has been 30 minutes since we ordered and nobody has refilled my coffee. The manager walks around like he is doing something but sadly.... He's not. Stay away if u want to eat this century"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a Denny's restaurant and I'm definitely glad that I went to this location. We were seated right away upon arrival and the place was comfortable and pretty quiet.The service was quick and the wait time to get our meal was very little. Our servers name was Cole and he was awesome!! He made great suggestions when my sister and I asked him what he recommended. He came to the table often to check up on us and to see if we needed anything. He was funny and easy to conversate with! Im glad we got a great server to make our visit memorable. I definitely recommend this location to anyone! Thanks again Cole!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! This place did not give us utensils until we got our meal. Which sucked because I could not stir my coffee and therefore it was cold.  We asked twice for utensils, as did other tables around us, however they were only served with our meal.  There was also a 40+ min wait between ordering and being served."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and was bowled over on the quality of the food and the speed of the service.  The restaurant was full and there seemed to be quite a few people waiting to be seated. I thought \"oh no\" as we were in a hurry (Isn't everyone?). But we were seated in under 3 minutes, received our drinks about 2 minutes later and our breakfast about 7 minutes after that.  The food was hot and delicious. All the employees were polite and helpful. My friend and I were there for a work convention, and I quite frankly wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  The parking was in a structure close by about 3 floors up, which also was better than I expected. I do not frequent Denny's back home but will have to give it a re-think, at least for breakfast."}
{"text":"If you don't have a lot of time then don't come. The food is great but the service is super slow"}
{"text":"I didnt want to give them one star but didnt have a choice. Not good service at all went in on a saturday morning around 10 a.m got seated they didnt take our drink order just sat us with the menu. waited about 20 mins saw the waitress a couple of times never made eye contact with us then finally after 30 min of no drinks or any contact we got up and left manager was no where to be found."}
{"text":"I used to go to this Denny's years ago and it was a decent place (for Denny's. Which translates to convenient for night people). Went here when I was back in town for the day and oh man, what happened? Worst Denny's I've ever been to. The waitress was so derpy, she just was clueless and did such a horrible job that she almost deserves an award for being terrible. I couldn't tell if she was just dumb or if she was deliberately being difficult. The food was bad even for Denny's low standards. It took forever, and the weird part is it wasn't even particularly busy when we were in there. Ugh, what happened Denny's? Really dropped the ball on that one, ugh."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write a review for a national chain restaurant but since there are other options for Denny's in the area I figured this would be helpful. This is a poor location. The staff consists of all mid 20 something guys who hate their job. While waiting for my food another customer complained that his drink glass had lipstick on it, another server and the cook argued over an order and I also overheard the staff talking poorly about one of their coworkers. The food was consistent with Dennys but not the experience. My server's uniform seemed not to be washed in a while as it was covered in stains (it was only 7:30am and judging by my visit its not like he was working hard). I'll never go back to this location. The Denny's on the 202 and Scottsdale Rd is much much better."}
{"text":"I have been in this place for about 30 minutes and still waiting for a waitress. Yes, I am sitting at a table. Lots of emty tables. ???"}
{"text":"Dennys food is awesome. belive me you will never leave there feeling anything less than stuffed full. The all day breakfasts are just amazing but too big as they are served with a huge side of pancakes and syrup!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worst food ever! I ordered the nachos and I was served incredibly stale chips with cold cheese. I sent it back to melt the stuff and it returned with slightly warm cheese and missing all of the other toppings. I understand that it's Vegas and I shouldn't have high expectations, but it completely changes my perception of Dennys. I drove by it yesterday and was disgusted at the thought of every going there again. I never realized how one experience can change your perceptions completely, but one simple plate of nachos did just that."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever. We got here at 11:24 am and we didn't leave until almost 2:00pm. They took over an hour to get our food which was wrong. Then later after 4 out of 5 of us got our correct orders my husband still hadn't gotten his food. We ate very quickly since we had an appointment and everyone had finished eating meanwhile my husband still hadn't gotten his food. We asked for the bill and it took another 20 minutes to get it and they still hadn't gotten us his food. In the end we just canceled his order and my husband left without eating. They gave us a free oreo smoothie to try and make up for the wait however the oreo smoothie we got was just warm milk. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"This location is the closest to both my home and work. For that reason alone I have eaten here more than a few times, however the service is always terrible! I call in my order before work and I'm told my food will be ready in twenty minutes, but when I arrive the food is not ready and the order is not correct when they finally bring it to me. This has happened on several occasions. Something has to change. The leadership is lacking at this location and needs to be remedied immediately!"}
{"text":"Sat at countertop. Waited 10 minutes for server to greet me, she passed by me several times before that. Not thrilled on the service."}
{"text":"I went to this Denny's the other day. The waiter, Christopher, had been working a double shift because the third shift waiter hadn't showed up yet. He was exhausted but was still friendly and smiling.  We wanted nachos but don't like the tortilla chips. Christopher suggested getting them on seasoned fries instead.  They were the best food I'd had at Denny's. It really should be on the menu.  You should commend Christopher for being an awesome waiter. It's not easy to remain in a good mood when you've been on your feet for 16 hours and don't know when you'll be allowed to go home."}
{"text":"Sat us at a 2 person table and then voluntarily upgraded us to a freshly clean booth.  Food came quick and was delicious. Customer service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for lunch today and I'm really glad I did. I got seated quickly and ordered the build-your-own sampler with jalapeno bottle caps, mozzarella cheese sticks and a cheese quesadilla with sour cream, marinara and pico de gallo sauces. The food arrived at the table quickly and everything was tasty, hot and fresh. Kathy was a superstar waitress...she knew when I wanted something and she knew when to leave me alone. ;) I'll certainly return here for the yummy food, the great prices and the friendly, cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"You can read my review of trying to get a decent omelet at Cracker Barrel (and how that turned out). So, I've known Denny's to have great breakfast food for years. I pass this location just about every day and I finally chose to go in not too long ago. As you can see by my profile, I don't connect to or add friends from FB, email or any other venue. I come here to find good businesses, be steered away from bad ones, and view the same.  Service can be hit and miss, as you see in other reviews. At the same time, the foods I've historically enjoyed from Denny's as a restaurant can be found here. One of the things I appreciate is that they have a pretty decent selection of GF (Gluten Free) items. Granted, there is the same issue of cross-contamination that is generally common at chain eating establishments. So far, however, that has not proved to be an issue re: my orders.   The $2, $4, $6, $8 menu also has GF items as well.   I am an omelet person. I have ordered three different types of omelets. All of them have been great (so, great cook in the back!). With the three experiences I have had, I would say that things tend to run a bit more smoothly when there is a manager/supervisor in the store. That aside, my experiences have been good.   Military friendly!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, filthy and complete unorganized staff. Took us an hour to he our order, not exactly what we ordered. Food and Coffee were cold.  Don't recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my gf, and we were the only customers in the entire restaurant. This is the only time I have never left a tip. Our server set us, and got our drinks and took our order a in a timely manner. Then everything went wrong. I order coffee, twenty minutes go by and still no food, our waitress never comes to refill drinks, and still no food. At 30 min we finally received our food. I ordered a bacon avocado burger with jalapenos. The burger was received with no ketupt or mustard, and the jalapenos were brought in a side bowl. The burger was extremely dry, probably because it was sitting on the server counter for 15 min. My gf ordered a steak with cheesey potatoes and garlic bread. She received reg mashed potatoes, and her steak looked like it was left out in a gutter for a week, before cooked. Our server never came to refill drinks or ask how the meal was, WE WERE THE ONLY CUSTOMERS. Wanda did decide to shout at us from the kitchen to see if we were still alive, from the disaster of a meal we were served. I used to love dennys, but this exsperience has lost my service for life. Go to waffle house, they will at least give you a refill on coffee. Worst 25$ I have ever spent."}
{"text":"This food is guilty pleasure food. You definitely don't want to come here if you're on a diet or are even wanting to maintain your weight. I'm disgusted in myself every time I come here, but the food combinations are crazy and one of a kind. It's a decent place to come for a huge breakfast or if you're still out at 4 in the morning and need some greasy sustenance."}
{"text":"Food and service OK, but this was the filthiest Denny's we've seen. We were one of only two parties seated at dinnertime on a Sunday night. There must have been 6 un-bussed un-cleaned tables. The bathrooms (mens, womens) obviously had not been cleaned or attended to all day as there was trash all over the floor. The toilet paper roll was on the floor (the roll holder was broken), and there was no soap or hot water available (we reported this to the health dept.)  Do yourself a favor and eat at the 4* Chuck Wagon Restaurant in the Longhorn Casino 100 yards to the north. The only reason we visited this Denny's was that the Longhorn was crowded."}
{"text":"Arianna is a really slow waitress. The other waiters were very helpful especially Chris in getting us more coffee napkins and silverware. Also we asked for bacon not sausage so they told us to give back the sausage off the plate that my husband had already eaten off of back to her . I hope they didn't serve that to anyone else . I have never seen this before . I will never eat ate this Denny's again ."}
{"text":"I met some friends here for some late night coffee and dessert. The poor place was severely understaffed. They had ONE guy running the entire place and it was just impossible for him to keep up. He was trying his best, but he could only do so much being on his own. I felt so bad for him because there were a LOT of disgruntled customers complaining to him. (Dennys should hire more people to help this guy!) It took over a  1/2 hour for me to get my coffee and a sundae, but I watched what he was going through and told him to take his time, I was not in a big rush anyhow. When he did finally get me my coffee and sundae, he did not charge me due to the wait. I made sure to leave him a $10 tip regardless of the situation because he really was a very nice server."}
{"text":"Mal servicio, de principiantes, la comida tiene mal aspecto pero seg√∫n mis compa√±eros no tiene mal sabor, la mesera s√∫per lenta pero amable la pobrecita. Tengo una hora y media aqu√≠ y no me han tra√≠do un club Sandwich que ped√≠ yo, ya vinieron como 3 veces a pedir disculpas y dicen que ah√≠ viene, espero que llegue antes del a√±o 3000. Sin duda alguna es el peor Dennys al que hemos llegado en todos los lugares del pa√≠s que hemos visitado."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to a Denny's in years then i took my nephew here on the day before Christmas Eve for his birthday. We went in around noon. They were busy but attentive. We had an extraordinary customer service experience during our visit. The staff, including other wait staff and management, was friendly and kept in close communication with us regarding our food and service. The area was clean. Exceptional customer service during our visit."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this location ZERO stars! I literally just walked out just now on my birthday. I walked in and wasn't greeted for at least after 5 minutes of standing there. The server initially walked right by us and went to take an order of a table before seating us. We weren't even greeted yet! Then the server walked back into to kitchen, passed right by us and still didn't even acknowledge we were standing there. A couple more minutes went by and everyone was still working in the kitchen. So we loudly asked if we were allowed to seat ourselves. We know the cook heard us because he looked at us but still no acknowledgement. Finally, that same server came back out with waters for a different Table. As she walks by she finally says, I'll be with you in a minute. She then continues to take the order of this other Table. Meanwhile there are 3 other people working in the kitchen. Not sure if anyone of them was also a server or all 3 cooks, but seems to me that somebody could have sat us. We stood around for close to 10 minutes total during the disgusting presentation of the lack there of customer service. This facility should be a ashamed of themselves for the way they treat their customers. My suggestion, evaluate your staff and retract them proper etiquette when balancing the tables they already have with new incoming customer. Honestly, it's common sense."}
{"text":"Food was amazing ...server was on point and had the best personality ...came to checknon n us when we needed him to didn't have to wait long for anything ...strawberry lemonade is delicious  fyi."}
{"text":"We went about a month ago and while the place was empty, the service was good (wish I knew our waitresses name) the place was a wreck. My glass has something IN IT, new glass had food on the outside, husbands coffee cup looked dirty. Said we weren't going back but this morning everything else was packed. Denny's was busy too but far less than everything else. While the wait staff was sufficient, the cooks were not. Husband had the grandstand over medium. Lucky if his eggs were over easy and bacon under done. I ordered a Ham & cheddar cheese omelet, I got America \"sauce\" and some sort of white cheese I couldn't make out. My hash browns were burnt. The waitress and the hostess only offered \"sorry\"  And when did they get so expensive for such cheap food?!?! It was $10 for my subpar omelette. I can go have steak & all the trimmings for that at Texas Road House. Never again!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here ordered in and food was digusting this is my second time eating here last time my son got sick threw up at the restaurant that was a couple of years ago we were in the neighborhood and against all warning we still stopped I ordered the ultimate breakfast skillet which had ordered at my neighborhood dennys and always superb here was very disappointed skillet wasn't even sizzling, my mom ordered chicken fried steak and food was cold was served on a skillet hers not sizzling either either we sent food back all in all horrible service horrible food having to stop at another place for something to eat."}
{"text":"Food is always good at Dennys, though not to clean at this one. Hope the kitchen is clean."}
{"text":"Horrible service, never once did the waitress came to the table. I almost walked out. Kept on calling for a waiter/waitress and most of the were talking in the kitchen and not attending customers. I will not return to this Dennys."}
{"text":"When I saw they were putting in a Denny's at the Scottsdale 101, I couldn't wait to check it out.  I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed.  I have been to many Denny's in my life and this one was the most impressive.  The inside is beautiful.  Very open with comfortable booths, bright and tastefully decorated.  All the staff was polite and friendly.  The service and food was great and they even have a coffee bar where you can walk in and grab a coffee to go.  This location is a must try.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Its got good food, but its rarely really clean.  Enjoy the plaque in the entrance that notes this place for having the fewest sanitation violations..."}
{"text":"Staff is nice enough but very unorganized. I ordered breakfast w/my family of 3. The food came out separately and half of the items were either over cooked or cold. A separate order to go was completely ignored. Will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"1 1/2 hours to get our food and you would have thought it was set in a refrigerator..... Ice cold food....server was very unapologetic for any of it....she was not seen for the majority of our time there.... The absolute worst experience I've ever had at a Dennys if I could do less stars I would we will never return"}
{"text":"LORD HELP US PLEASE !!!!!   Worst place in town to have a meal.  After negative reviews I'm bold enough to see it for myself and so I did!!! Went over to celebrate my grandson's b-day and wasn't expecting the HORRIBLE SERVICE we received !! Not to mention the food was cold and undercooked so when the Waitress came around she took it back with a  NASTY ATTITUDE as if she was going to pay for my bill... RIDICULOUS !!  Then she kept on hitting the booth from the back where my husband and I were sitting at.. So when I asked her how long she had been a server?  She said 4 mo.  I told her I had been a waitress myself, and my job was to make sure the customer's enjoyed their meal and leave happy with a positive experience. She looked at me like I was speaking a different language.  When I called for the manager he came talked to us and sent her to the back of the kitchen, told her \"I don't want to see you right now \" Not the first time she's been rude to customers probably. So for all managers please hire people that want to do their job. I have been to other Denny's locations and this one is far from being a place of business.  So sad for the 1 star review but the truth won't hurt."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant the other day. I usually go to kings but thought I would try something different since it was close by. Worst service I've ever had. The people were rude, the food was terrible and I wasn't impressed with the cleanliness. When I asked to speak to a manager, a woman came over and I believe she said she was the owner and she was even ruder than the rest. She didn't seem to care at all about the poor quality of the restaurant. Overall I would rather travel the 300 yards down the road over to kings for the better food and better service."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at this location. Service was fast. Our waitress was a doll! And usually at this types of sit down restaurant they sit you around creepy people. Not today. Was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Not the best milkshake I've ever had at 5am on the Las Vegas strip. Certainly not the worst  Update: there was more milkshake in the metal thing. Plus 1 star  2nd Update: the milkshake was actually the best part of the meal. 5 stars"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years and have very good luck here. The food is always prepared the way I like it. The staff and management is very friendly. They make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Watch your back.  There was a giant roach in the wall.  I told the teenager who was hosting and left a second after sitting down."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!!!  This place was not even busy.  My family and I ended up walking out of this place.  Hostess claimed to be the manager.  If she was really the manager she a horrible one......"}
{"text":"They have the worst service ever here. I had to wait what felt like years to be sat down and not to mention that it wasn't a busy night. Our waitress was so rude and she forgot that she took our order and came back to ask us if someone took our order already when she clearly took the order. We waited 35 mins for our food after ordering, but then had to wait another 30 mins for it to be served since our stupid waitress forgot she took our order. Also, when i got my bill, the waitress literally threw it on the table. I am never coming back to this denny's. The food was disgusting and the service is CRAP."}
{"text":"It's average during regular hours      Went there twice after midnight.   Defiantly shittier quality.  Under staffed"}
{"text":"This is great dennys! Most of the time you will get good customer service here. food is always great"}
{"text":"Terrible service, I can't rate any higher than 1 star because at least they seated us. 4 families came in when we did and only one was served water. We were never greeted and we watched waitresses talk in the back of house for 5-10 min while one busser bussed tables and took orders from other another table. After 15 min of no greeting we decided to leave and find food elsewhere."}
{"text":"My best friend and I have gone a couple times during the graveyard shift (1-3am) and both the food and service have been great. The plates had a lot of food even though we ordered from the 2,4,6,8 menu. The cook is a very friendly man, all the times we've gone there he comes out to check on how we liked the food. Given its really late and obviously not busy, which gives him time to come out and chat it's still great gesture. It shows that he really cares about his costumers. Haven't gone during the day but definitely satisfied with the graveyard costumer service."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, Denny's. Growing up in South FL totally ruined Denny's for me- they were just not nice places to go eat. BUT I am pleased to report this place is totally what Denny's should be in a perfect world.   Like a month ago, the wife says \"Let's go to the Denny's up the street\". Holy crap I thought, as flashbacks from FL started to work their way in to my head. Needless to say, since it was the wife's idea- We hit Denny's.   We walk in and it's clean- I'll take it. We have a friendly lady get us a booth- even better. Waitress comes over, a totally sweet, older lady who is wonderfully sweet to the little one- Go Denny's I'm thinking. We order our appropriately inexpensive food and sip our endless coffee- maybe I was wrong about Denny's I think. Food comes, just as advertised. I got a grand slam, the wife gets a breakfast burrito and the little one gets a kids grand slam- Ya know what? The food was really good. We do our thing, pay our bill and peace out- Totally great experience.   I must say, I am happy to have given Denny's a second chance. It is just right for a quick, easy, cheap breakfast. We have been back a bunch of times since then and it's been the same each time. All I can say is Yay!"}
{"text":"Went there, had to wait. Waiting wasn't the issue but the service there was so bad, we just left before we were greeted. They puts us back back the dish room doors and was left there. This is a horrible place to take your family and we're a family of 6. Go to Eat n Park or Bob Evans, if you want a better experience..."}
{"text":"Server Thanh did not smile or introduce herself, she asked my companion if he would like a drink and not myself, then she was loud talking at a customer on another table and her exact words were \"Did you watch the game last night ? What the hell was that they were bullying Calgary\" When she went to our table to get our order my companion says he is not ready but I was and I was giving her my order and she cut me off and says \"Well if I put your order now your orders wont be at the same time \", When we were ready to order we had to repeat ourselves three times and she still got one order wrong."}
{"text":"Great pancakes and free refills on soda, as soon as I finished the first drink the waitress came with another drink immediately. Friendly staff and fast service (5PM).  - The toilets were not clean."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant no stars. Extremely unprofessional, undertrained staff. They have these tables that can be folded underneath to shorten and extend the length, and as in was sitting there the folded side of the table completely dropped, hitting my knees, which are now bruised. I spoke to the manager saying that the tables were a safely hazard and he replied back, \"how are they a safety hazard? Must've been unlocked or something.\" Instead of apologizing and trying to listen to my concern he simply disregarded what happened and was very rude about it. I'll never go to another Denny's again."}
{"text":"Take out is a hit or miss most times. If you ever need EXTRAS of anything, make sure that you check that you get those extras while at checkout otherwise you're most likely not going to get them. The weekend staff on Sunday behind the checkout counter makes you think that they hate their lives, I bet you can't even pay them to smile or act enthusiastic.... but then again it's really busy Sunday after church. Expect to wait 30 mins to sit if you have more than 2 people."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and wonderful atmosphere!!! Stop in and talk to Flo and Vera."}
{"text":"Ahh...yes!what can I say was in late night some months ago and ordered a hamburger(which one?idk)wouldn't have mattered as I was told to hold that thought.as the server a nice latin gentleman informed me he had to check with the kitchen to see if.....wait for it...if they had any HAMBURGER MEAT???well...after a few minutes I was informed that I was Lucky !!!they had hamburger meat.WOOHOO..Please.if your going to have a Denny's you should make sure your able to serve what's on the menu.food was okay.service was decent.The casino itself has interesting clientele..tweekers..hookers...and moochers oh my!!"}
{"text":"My family and I normally enjoy going to this particular location, but this last trip was horrible. We went on Saturday night around 9pm and it was really slow. There were 4 empty tables surrounding us that were full of dirty dishes and leftover food. Besides us, there was one other couple in our waitress' section, there was no reason for those tables not to be bussed. Her and another waitress were in a corner chatting when she should have been taking care of those tables. I finally had to ask for the one directly across from us to be bussed. It was so disgusting to have to see all that filth while trying to eat. It was also very annoying that we had to ask another person for refills since our waitress seemed to be too occupied chatting. Won't sit in her section again. Wish I would have caught her name."}
{"text":"The service was slow, and the waitress was not nice and friendly enough, to keep me patient. My food was so plain and not good. I like Denny's I just don't want to spent money on service like that."}
{"text":"Once again Denny's disappoints.  I honestly don't know why we keep giving them a chance, but here we are.  After having a horrible experience at the Denny's on Bell a couple of months ago, we decided to try out this one in Youngstown.  Bad idea. Our waitress messed up every order, and there were 5 of us.  My son-in-law asked for Canadian bacon and waffles with his grand slam and was given the pancakes and regular bacon and they forgot his sausage.  Once he did get the requested items they were cold.  The hashbrowns were oily and burnt.  My daughter's veggie burger was soggy and missing the lettuce, so strike two.  The veggies on my other two daughter's hamburger were old and gross, strike three.  My food was fine, surprisingly, but we will NEVER eat at a Denny's ever again.   I really wish we would have read the reviews before going and throwing away $60 here."}
{"text":"Love coming here with my family, Tony is a great manager and an awesome guy. Our server is usually Eric, he's  a super hard worker. Never had to ask for a refill or anything. We come here over IHOP because it's just better overall. The service, food, and experience when we come is always great quality."}
{"text":"Skillet was missing ingredients, served my 8 year old niece rotten grapes, then went and washed them off and served them again. Service was mediocre (being kind) which she did try to make up for with a free dessert. Glad I won't be coming to this location anymore."}
{"text":"I love when my appetizer comes out with the rest of my food. I love when my bread is burnt. I love when they straight up ask for a tip.. HA Sarcasm HA"}
{"text":"Ok......yes it's Denny's and most think...\"well what do you expect?\"  I expect if Denny's has the budget to run commercials on TV non stop about their food then you should hire people to serve the food!! How can you be so woefully understaffed?  One girl who played hostess, server, and  cashier and did not do well at any of the three tasks.  Where's the manager??  I know you have one.....that person should be  there helping out. Food was actually decent.  Came for the pumpkin pecan pancakes that I see ENDLESS commercials about.  They were tasty. As we were waiting to cash out a lone woman was waiting to be seated and looked as though she'd been standing there a fair amount of time.  She asked me if this is how the service was and I said......yes it's all been slow........she left.  Good for her....too many other places that WANT to get you seated and fed to waste time standing waiting for a sub par experience. Get the hint Denny's...the IHOP across the street is always packed!!   HIRE SOME STAFF!!"}
{"text":"Typical American pancake/coffee house diner. I think they have nice (though not as awesome as IHOP from what I heard) and affordable food/menu selections and I'm a bit surprised they serve spaghetti in there :D I love their milkshakes though, it's exceptional than any milkshake I've ever had. Service is great; their wait staff are very friendly. I come here if I feel like straying away from Asian cuisine or when the late-night craving kicks in. :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I came in here for breakfast. Half of the restaurant was nearly full and the the other half was nearly empty. There was another group of teenagers who were sitting on the bench with backpacks, so I figured they were just hanging out. Soon, I realized they probably had the same dilemma as us. We waited 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. We were stood right in front of the counter and the waitress just ignored us every time she walked by. The chef kept making eye contact with us, but did not say anything. Finally, as we were leaving, she was getting angry with the waitress and I'm pretty sure I heard her say, \"Is anybody getting the front?\" And as we walked out I think she said, \"Now they're walking out!\". They were not that busy and they couldn't even bother to acknowledge our existence, which is why we decided to leave. I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I suggested going here two or three days after eating a fantastically tasty Fit Fare vegetable breakfast skillet at a Denny's restaurant on Mayo Boulevard near Scottsdale Road in Phoenix/Scottsdale area. I ended up regretting going to the Surprise location, and would not go again. --It surprised me that a simple breakfast entree could taste so good at one location and so ho-hum/blah to even \"yuck\" at another.  I was seated immediately, and the waitress was personable and nice. I swished food crumbs off the booth seat before sitting down. The restaurant was very busy and it took a long while for the food to come out. My companion and I just talked.  My skillet came out, piping hot, but the broccoli was under-cooked, and the potatoes were soft and not seasoned. I tasted from multiple areas and was so disappointed, I asked the waitress if the dish could be fixed. She kindly took it back.  ---At the Mayo Blvd. location, the piping hot fried potatoes were nice and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and perfectly seasoned (reminded me a little of Red Robin's french fry seasoning--but couldn't quite pin what they were using on the potatoes). The broccoli was cooked to perfection and I ate it all up (I didn't think I would eat it as I am not a real broccoli fan, but it was cooked and seasoned so nicely, that I did.)  After a good amount of time (my companion was 75 percent done with his meal), my recooked dish came back. The potatoes were cooked more, but still not seasoned and still soft on the outside. The broccoli was cooked better. I added salt to the potatoes and ate the dish. --I was really hungry. In more than several bites, I got the taste of \"old\" grease (as from a dirty grill).   My companion had asked for crisp bacon, and received soft bacon and a poor quality cut. He also told the waitress when ordering, that he would like his toast toasted completely (he let her know that on prior visits, sometimes the toast would be very light, while another person's toast would be nice toasted... Even so, his toast came out nearly white on one side and medium toasted on the other.  Our waitress didn't seem to come back as much after I sent the food back. I felt like maybe I spooked her by sending the dish back. She refilled my empty water glass when my companion asked (I had been drinking his when mine was empty). She was personable, however.  I think the cooks, and perhaps the kitchen equipment (the toaster), and maybe the cleaning habits (dirty grill), do a disservice to this location. They could learn from the Mayo Blvd. location."}
{"text":"I tried the Dennis. This is worst Dennis I. Have ever tried. The smell is very bad and cleanliness is very worst. There is only one waitress for whole restaurant. But the food is fine. Altogether they need to improve the staff and need to keep the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why the place was that crowded despite their very poor breakfast service. We were five people there and every single dish we had, as well as two dishes we asked for giving a try, was a disappointment. I will never try to eat a breakfast there again."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible! I have on more than one occasion waited an unnecessarily long time to be served. The last time, my friends and I waited almost half an hour (24 minutes to be exact) before a server even approached our table. The restaurant was barely busy so there was no excuse.   The server offered no apology or explanation. The food took another hour during which time the server never returned to our table to check in or ensure we had drinks (would have loved some water while we waited at least).   Completely unacceptable standards for any establishment. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"My meal was good - certainly up to Dennys standards.  My wife's burger was not a patty, but rather a crumpled mess of cooked ground beef.  We would have brought this to the attention to our waitress, Rebecca, but she basically took our order, dropped our food and ignored us until it was time to bring the bill.  When we mentioned about the quality of food and the awful service Rebecca was insincere in her apology and made all kinds of excuses.  No offer of reducing the bill or any other compensation.  Rebecca and the kitchen staff certainly deserved the ZERO tip they received."}
{"text":"The customer service was really good at this location!  The waiter was on top of things and kept things really smooth!  We had a great experience here!  I was kind of disappointment that they are limited to when kids each free but overall it was rather good."}
{"text":"So after we couldn't sleep, and decided that we were hungry at 4am, we chose our local Denny's. When we walked in, Ron pleasantly seated us far from the door as he saw that we were cold. He then brewed a fresh batch of decaf for me after he pleasantly took our drink orders. He is the most polite gentleman and it was definitely nice to have him serve us as we were a bit weary of being the only people eating there this early. However, Ron made us feel at ease and quickly took our food order amidst doing three other jobs: answering the phone, seating more guests, and running food. We both work in restaurants, and we're pleased to see him constantly smiling and hustling, with the most chipper of an attitude. Our milkshake (I know it was 4am but sounded amazing) was brought out super quick by the man himself, soon followed by our food order, exactly how it should have come. Ron refilled our drinks multiple times, as well as every other guest's (more people started showing up). Overall, I wish our restaurant was still hiring, and I could recruit Ron to be part of our team! And by the way, he's a newlywed! Congrats Ron! I have never had such great service in any restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here late night after partying at Devil's Martini nearby. The atmosphere was fun as about 15 semi-drunk patrons all congregated for some late night carbs! Our server was busting his hump at 2am and was working hard so kudos to him! The food was good as always. I can eat breakfast food at anytime so I'm always a fan."}
{"text":"I am all about 24 hour places that I can go and get work done or hang out with friends, but I am no longer a loyal customer of Denny's.  Last night, I visited Denny's looking forward to getting some delicious Pumpkin Pecan Pancakes and hanging out with my cousin that I haven't seen in over a year. We walk in and there's two tables of four, a table of three, and a table of two in this huge Denny's, basically they were empty. So, we greeted our friends waiting for us with hugs all around. Seconds after we sat down our waitress comes over and asks us to, \"keep it down, the other customers are looking at us and the manager asked for us to keep it down because we were being loud.\"   And sidenote - this little waitress with dyed red hair was not the nicest gal either. Not sure what her issue was, but she was feeling some type of way about her life last night. And that's not a diss at the staff cause 90% are some super cool people that love to chat, especially cause it's slow on business. I've had some awesome servers at this Denny's but she was not even trying to be nice. Also, the cooks are awesome and do a wonderful job!!!  So, after we were hushed by the waitress, I was over it, but would stay if the majority wanted to stay. She asked for our drink order and I asked for a water and a hot chocolate. And naturally they didn't have hot chocolate... What? Who doesn't have hot chocolate in the winter? And why do you always run out of stuff and are never busy? At this point, I'm not even going to order anything.   We looked at the menu's for a brief moment and decided not to stay because we did not feel welcome. It would be different if the waitress waited 5 minutes to see if we were actually going to be that loud or if the manager Darryl came over and said something himself, but the mood was off and it's not right to patron establishments that really don't want you there.   Message to the Manager Darryl: Looks like last night 11/23/2015 was a rough night. Brianne H. left a message about how her service was terrible and things were just rough. It is unprofessional to be upset from a prior incident and take it out on other customers. It is bad business to always be out of stuff. It is bad business to have people that come in regularly and not know their names or have any investment in them. I have been in pretty regularly since September and know tons about you and your moods from multiple servers and customers, yet have never met you or had any interaction with you because you don't talk to customers. I literally just told someone this past weekend that the service and things had changed at this Denny's, but I'm gonna call and tell them differently."}
{"text":"Phoenix AZ Dennys  Time for some food!!!!! Pretty empty so im getting some fast service which is always good"}
{"text":"Ran into a rude host. Have us a hard time and ugly looks because we wanted a booth. Uncalled for..."}
{"text":"Never eating at a Denny's in Vegas again.. I thought it was just the Denny's on fort apache and trop but I guess it's this one as well.. First of all the establishment is filthy! They need a surprise health inspection ASAP! My glass came out with lipstick on it so I asked for another glass and the server just looked at me like I ugh.. Okay!?! Then our food came out and it was swimming in oil.. Hmmm yummy! Then I notice hair in my food =\  can you say gross! After that I completely lost my appetite.. Never again.."}
{"text":"I ate here a few months ago and overall was impressed. One of the cooks was very rude but the waiter I had was very nice and professional. I would recommend this Denny's!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here last night and was NOT impressed!  1) They overcharged me on one of the bills. 2) It was VERY VERY HOT and MISERABLE (NO AC?) 3) They didn't have the vanilla shot for the soft drink available. 4) It took them over 20 mins and I then got up and got a menu myself. 5) When I told them I was taking the menu and to come see me in a couple minutes, they never came and saw me and I had to get up about 15 minutes later to come see me as I am ready to order. 6) The hamburger on the bun was not hot, it was between warm and cold. 7) They SKIMPED on the fries BIG TIME.  I like Dennys, but this place SUCKS BIG TIME!"}
{"text":"Denny's is closed for Remodel. So excited!! Great food, great service in a new dining space, can't wait!! Thank you All. See you Saturday morning for breakfast for the...NEW Triple Bacon Sample...honey jalape√±o bacon...mmm! Update....Friday 5pm. Denny's is OPEN!! The restaurant looks Outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Extremely crowded on Sundays and they aren't able to keep up.  We waited for 30 plus minutes while an unoccupied booth remained un-cleaned and empty.  Very rude manager (and I use that term loosely in his case)  Instead of trying to calm the clients down he was condescending and angry.  Food service and/or customer service is not for everyone.  If you can't stand the heat in the kitchen get out.  BTW \"customer is always right\" is a term he fails to comprehend.  Would rather sit on a rocking chair in a friendly porch at the neighboring restaurant and wait for an hour knowing my patronage is welcomed there. (Cracker Barrel)"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! I walked in and it smelt like dead fish. The staff seemed to be bothered by me ordering. The food I ordered was so greasy I felt sick three days later. That place needs to hire people who care about having a clean and fresh place to eat and being presentable. Sickest place I have been in a while! I will never go back!"}
{"text":"The food here is always excellent quality and served very quickly.  The staff is a little too weird for my tastes though.  I get they hire some very nice retiress for the daytime but their complaining about other employees or doing their sidework needs to be kept to themselves.  I'd rather not here how they loath their jobs when I know some people looking for work."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. We always get good friendly service. Their food is good and prices fair."}
{"text":"I ate here on 9/21 for breakfast. It was a busy day and the place was packed. I ordered the veggie omelette and asked to replace the cheddar cheese with Swiss. I got a plate of sauteed veggies on top of which were eggs that looked srambled. They kept the cheddar and dumped the Swiss cheese on top of the hash browns. When I asked why my order didn't look like an omelette, the server told me that I couldn't expect it to look like what I make at home. She didn't even apologize and I quietly ate my food.  When it was time for me to pay, I used a discount I got from completing a survey online. When I asked the cashier to explain my bill, she did so with an \"attitude\" and glared at me. I then politely commented that I just wanted to know where the discount was applied. I know that this is a busy location, but Denny's need to do a better job hiring people that can handle the voume, take the stress while providing excellent customer service. It comes with the turf.  It's not enough that the server sounds or looks friendly if you can't even deliver what the customer asked for. I don't need lip service.   Perhaps if I were drunk I'd give it 5 stars. Sadly, I wasn't.  Awful place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Food is good. Zac he is the best server. Super nice & friendly. The dish that he recommed is pretty good.  become a big fan of Denny now:)"}
{"text":"Me and my wife were just looking for something cheap to eat so we decided to come to dennys. The place was almost empty and it nearly took 15 minutes just to get our drink order and another 15 to get it. We were close to just walking out. Service here is bad go someplace else"}
{"text":"We went there last evening the service was slow we waited over 25 minutes to get our food my burger tasted like the meat was about to spoil my ff were cold I  my burger bun was burnt asked them to take my meal off our bill due to it was uneatiable the \"manager said he would discount it but not take it off the bill due to the fact I had try ed to eat a few bites of the burget if this had been the first time this had happened  I could understand but we took my mother there for Christmas dinner and after we were seated never saw anyone again so after 45 minutes we hot up and left and it wasn't even busy so that says something"}
{"text":"Renee is a very unpleasant lady. Slow service. Confused waitresses. Decent food for 24 hr breakfast but terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars, because of the Excellent customer service. Our waitress was very friendly (forgot to ask for her name), We came between 1am-2am 11/25/16. The Rudolf cups are so cute, Thank you!   3 stars for the banana pancake with salted caramel :)"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch, food was very hot and delicious, waitress was extremely friendly, and you can tell she knew her menu very well. Ordered a lumberjack slam, wife ordered the fit slam, and we ordered what the waitress told us was a limited time dessert (mostly for the wife, since I don't really care for sweets) called the red velvet pancake puppies. Food tasted amazing and it was more than enough to fill us up! Had to take some leftovers home! Needless to say, we will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was fantastic from the moment we walked in the door until the moment we walked out.   Each staff member we interacted with offered smiles and kindness. Our server for the evening, I believe his name was Andres, was one of the best servers I've ever had at any restaurant. Incredibly courteous, attentive and thorough, he struck me as someone who loved his job and took pride in providing exceptional service. He deserves a raise!  Also, special mention to our hostess, I missed her name, who provided coloring books and crayons for the kids. When she heard the 3 year old's favorite color was blue, she even dropped off extra blue crayons!  All our meals (seven) arrived together and each one was made exactly as ordered. The food was hot, fresh and very tasty. I'll definitely be back for another Cali Club Sandwich. It was delicious.   The restaurant was very clean, including the washroom.   All in all, a truly great experience. Well done!"}
{"text":"This Denny's absolutely exceeded my expectations for service & quality! We had a pretty complicated breakfast order, but our server Ozlem was on-point so everything came out perfect. After some other questionable meals in Vegas - this was a welcomed comfort. We were pretty close to stopping back in and purchasing the coffee mug they had as a souvenir."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a great day of shopping, just to have a mediocre experience. Food was cold, at least what we got of it. Most of my families orders were incomplete and looked gross. Service was terrible. Waitress was very very rude. Very obvious she would rather not be here.Thought the diner idea was pretty good but definitely wouldn't stop by again."}
{"text":"Food was great atmosphere was awesome. I ordered pancakes it was soft and yummy. Service was awesome. Ill definitely come back for their specials."}
{"text":"Late night dinner after the movies, it was ok. One waitress on a Friday night but she did her best. Waffles were great!"}
{"text":"One of the lower quality Denny's service isn't up to par. I was seated without a menu. It's like you are invisible to most of the waiters. It takes about 20 minutes to get a cup of orange juice. Best advice go to another dennys or a better breakfast/brunch spot.it will take well over an hour from being seated to served. I personally won't come again."}
{"text":"After being seated, we ordered our breakfast and we promptly were served our drinks, a coffee and hot chocolate with 2 waters. As time went on we watched 5 tables around us seated with more breakfast goers. The same waitress helped those tables as well as ours. About 30 minutes in all the tables around us were served food and we were still sitting there with no food and our drink ran dry. Others after us ate and had left and then so did I. This dennys needs to work on a few things"}
{"text":"I have not been to a Denny's in many years and now I remember why, however this is an Az Shuttle pickup location, so I decided to grab some breakfast seeing as how I was early for my shuttle. However now I regret eating here seeing as the food and service were awful. My turkey bacon was very oily and soggy and though they did put butter on my toast, they only remembered to do so on one of the slices. I prefer cream cheese to butter so I asked a passing waitress for some and she informed me that they didn't carry cream cheese. What kind of breakfast place doesn't have cream cheese? So I asked for a bit  more butter, but I never got it. Lastly I had my credit card out on top of the check for around 20 minutes, trying to get my waitress' attention, but I never managed to. In the end I just threw some cash on the table and ran outside when I saw the shuttle pull up. I rarely write negative reviews, but I was completely astounded by how bad EVERYTHING was at this Denny's."}
{"text":"The service here is the worst!  None of the staff even acknowledged us, as we waited to be seated for over 15 mins. and they had plenty of open tables.  the wait staff never said a word, or looked at us.   I wouldn't even eat there for free!!!! Terrible! we walked out1"}
{"text":"Never had Denny's before and was greeted to a smile and a guest star on my Snapchat!  Overall great experience, great food, great staff."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Place was run down. Service was non existent. Iced coffee had bits of orange pulp in it! No apology from the server (if she was ever there) forgot a drink, forgot skim milk for the coffee -- even after asking for it a second time when the coffee came out -- coffee served without utensils & when the food came, it was cold for one and, there was a hair in my friend's hash browns!! Stay away from this smoke filled dingy place!!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing experience at this Denny's.  All thanks to Brenda J.  My family and I were celebrating a birthday.  Brenda greeted us with a huge smile immediately.  Her professionalism, kindness, and superior customer service skills made our day!  More employees should take a lesson from Brenda.  THIS is the way you treat people!  Thank you Brenda for making our day so special and putting a smile on our faces!!"}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I LOVE Denny's no matter how much $$ I have in my bank account, and will continue to come here, along with the finer dining places in Fountain Hills.  What I love is the cheap and yummy breakfasts, where you get a great amount of food for the low price.  In my opinion, Denny's has the best coffee and apple pie EVERRR.  So last night, hubby and I went there for Christmas Eve dinner, since most places were closed and we wanted a low-key, quiet dinner.    The manager Ray waited on us.  Hubby initially ordered a Bud Light.  They were out.  So he ordered a Coors Light, which came with a very frosty mug.  Good save.  I ordered the crispy chicken salad, which was very good (it never disappoints).  I also ordered a side of french fries, which came a good 10 - 15 minutes AFTER my salad.  Not thrilled at all.  Hubby ordered a prime rib cobb salad, which he said was \"okay\" but certainly didn't look like the picture on the menu.  Overall the dinner was good and acceptable.  After dinner Ray set the bill down on the table THEN asked us if we wanted dessert.  Bad etiquette.  We said that we did want dessert and I thought I detected a smidgen of annoyance on his face, but I could be wrong about that.  Remember I mentioned that I love their apple pie?  Well, that was shot to hell when Ray said they were again, out.  So I ordered the apple crisp.  Hubby ordered the chocolate lava cake.  Guess what?  They were ..... you guessed it ..... out.  He ordered a sundae instead.  Dessert was good but I had my heart set in the pie.  So, being that 3 of the 6 items we initially ordered....literally HALF.....were \"out\", you'd think they would offer us some sort of discount or something.  Nope.  We went there with the intention of tipping very nicely since the person who'd serve us wasn't home with their family on Christmas Eve, but decided not to, all things considered.  We will be back, but if this happens again I will insist on a discount!"}
{"text":"This Denny's, the first in downtown Toronto, opened a few months ago in a newly-refurbished building, more than a year after it was announced. I've come here a few times because I live in the area and it makes sense for a convenient sit-down breakfast or brunch on the weekend. It's rarely jam-packed, but usually there's an even mix of locals and tourists (not shocking since it's very close to the intercity bus terminal and the Eaton Centre).  Pros: Lots of variety, generally good quality, and some of the chain's limited-time offers are worth trying (recent faves include the Double Berry Pancakes and the Cali Avocado Skillet). A few decent healthy options (\"healthy\" always being relative when it comes to diners) though these tend to be a bit more expensive. Modern-looking location and good atmosphere overall.  Cons: Service can be slow at times, but it has been getting better since it opened. Prices are kind of high compared to the other breakfast chains in the area, especially if you're just getting a basic breakfast (there is no value menu as there is at Denny's in the U.S.) - though this may just be due to the prime downtown location."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in I was greeted with a warm Smile by the manager David. As he was checking out a previous guest I I kept my interaction with him brief to not be rude and placed a order to go at the breakfast bar station. I was then greeted by Victor- server (swing shift) who very politely  assisted me with making the best choice. I ordered  two sides of French toast and a side of hash browns. I appreciated that Victor was knowledgeable and  recommended I try the 2 4 6 8 value meal  to accomplish my task being sensitive to my request about portion control and even managed to save me some money in the process.  I had no idea that it was the middle of a shift change as these gentlemen all assisted me  in the most professional  and careful  manner possible. No one in the restaurant felt neglected and it was a very enjoyable atmosphere. Next I met Zane who was my actual grave server for the evening. He and Victor manage to drop my order with the chef, bring me a drink while I waited, and  entertained me without missing a Beat. Even the chef was in an upbeat mood and although I didn't get his name he acknowledge me  and got my order out faster than I expected. Zane even brought a personal touch to his ability to serve me when he politely recommended that I try the designer dessert cinnamon drizzle that they had available on my French toast. I even got to sample it before having it on my food and it was fantastic!! It brought a warm cinnamon bun flavor to the French toast that perfectly complemented it without being overly sweet. I was so impressed with my experience at this Denny's that if it weren't for a prior engagement I would have requested that my to-go order been made for me to dine in. If you're a person that loves breakfast at dinner time like I do occasionally come and have a warm experience at this location. The service really blew me away and I've never been happier I'm also big about tipping and it truly makes me feel wonderful inside giving what I can to those who gave me the very best of themselves first. I could go on and on about how this service truly went above and beyond the call of their duty but instead come in and see about it for yourselves"}
{"text":"Clean Denny's, waiter tried a little hard to be cool, but it was a nice experience for a big group of my family"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this was the BEST experience I've ever had at Denny's! Our server, Cindy, was easily the best waitress I've ever had (including 5 star expensive restaurants). She was super bubbly (an impressive trait at 5am), very helpful, and took amazing care of us. The food has definitely improved as well! The dining room was spotless, and you can tell they've been sprucing things up with their decor. My husband and I had stopped going to Denny's because pretty much everything had become rather disappointing, but after this morning's experience, we will definitely be coming here instead of IHOP :-)"}
{"text":"Ok, love  Denny's food but we had to send back the French toast twice...it was way to soggy...after the third attempt I just ate the edges... other then that it was very clean, our waitress was so sweet and so apologetic...and yes we will see you again in the near future!"}
{"text":"I came in with a few friends for some dinner and I can say the food for the price is great! I also love their garlic bread that comes with their spaghetti and meatballs.   The customer service is great! Our drinks were swiftly brought out and our food came out in an orderly fashion. They are all very nice and always filled our drinks when they got low. Our server was named Karri and she was just wonderful."}
{"text":"A lot of people eat breakfast there.. Well, food is legit but takes forever to get my combo! I love their french toast btw."}
{"text":"First of all this restaurant is open late nights which is great for late nights in Vegas. Their prices are affordable and the food is delicious. We ate here at least one meal every day because it was not expensive. They always provided us with great service. One day we found a 25% off coupon in one Vegas flyer, and they also give military discount. The pancakes are very good."}
{"text":"For a Dennys, this place usually has okay food & that's all that prevents me from rating it a 1 star. The problem is, in years of going there on & off, the service leaves something to be desired & they ALWAYS get my order wrong. Friends & collegues of mine have all had issues with their orders as well. Too bad people don't bother rating chains like these. Besides years of skimping on the sizes of to-go orders, there have been several occations their phone stays busy (because they \"didn't realize it was off the hook\"). For a place that's dead most of the time, you'd think they'd put their best foot forward when they get orders, especially for frequent customers, but that's nearly never the case. In this particular instance (that made me finally post a review), it was Christmas. I know they're slammed for being one of the few eateries open, but I'm sure they could foresee this. I have a lot of patience for waiting in times like these & little mix-ups, but the order was going to be done in \"15 minutes\". When I got there in 25, noone greeted me or even acknowledged me. I get it, you're busy. After about 7 minutes they grab some boxes, throw em in a bag & I pay (he even repeated the order to make sure it was right. Great!). I open my food & none of it's our's. We return it...nope, our's is gone. It'll be a little bit. Back in 15. Nope, but we can bring it to you. Great! Btw-\"we're out of your side dishes, can we change them\". Sure, fine, I just want the food I paid for an hour ago. An hour & half since we ordered & everything comes burnt, dry, under-done, no bread, no dipping sauce, not even ketchup. Awesome! Mmmm...chicken strips that've been fried twice with no sauce, fries with no ketchup...wow. Hindsight tells me we should've gotten our money back, for which we could've gotten 40 tacos at Jack in the Box that are worth the price paid, made exactly how you thought they'd be & probably even served with a smile.  I don't understand how they can charge the prices they do for the service & food they provide."}
{"text":"Service and food were great but we were seated right next to an open window near the beverage station and the young employees were using profanity throughout their conversations. I spoke to the manager and she didn't seem to believe it or even care. Won't be visiting this location anymore."}
{"text":"We stayed at the mirage so dennys was an extremely convenient location for us. However it was not a convenient location to get food. I know, kinda strange being a restaurant, but trust us this is not where you want to be if you are hungry or thirsty. We went on a Thursday night when most of the seats were empty and we're directed to sit down and wait on a bench. After a few minutes of staring at tables with menus and silver ware from afar we became jealous of the other guests. We decided to go to the white castle located at the bottom of the steps because our hunger had progressed by this point. BTW White Castle was amazing! The next morning we decided to get breakfast with the rest of our group and give dennys a second chance. We were split into two tables for one party and the tables were not close enough to consider us together as a group. We waited this time but not as long, we would have preferred to wait at this point as is appropriate for a large party. We noticed the place seemed semi busy for an average Denny's and didn't want to complain and began to wait. After about 10-15 min of waiting for a wait staff, and asking a few of them politely to find our wait staff. 2 of us asked from one table with 2 of the staff  and another of us at the second table with a third staff. (For a waiter to bring us water and silverware) After 20 minutes we all got up and went to McDonald's. We were surprised as first timers to Vegas that the \"busiest dennys in America\" (quote we overheard from the staff) was less full than the one back home in the suburbs of Michigan, yet the over-staffed restaurant in Vegas had now let us down twice in our first two days. Let me repeat that in case you lost me, we went to dennys 2 times in 2 days and were never spoke to a waiter. Spent 30+min of my hard earned vacation on their situation. It did make for a good anecdote for our friends back home.   Needs improvement."}
{"text":"This place stinks.  Food took forever. Place not really clean. Staff gave nasty service. Dishwasher must have been broken.  we actually got to see a some 50 year old man sleeping on his food (true)  We should have gone to the one on Mcdowell Rd."}
{"text":"Food ok. Service barely. Asked twice for silverware and coffee.  But did get 2nd cup of coffee well after I finished eating.   Offered a to go cup for the 2nd cup to get rid of me I guess :).  Thanks but no .. don't like to drink n drive.  No counter seating for singles."}
{"text":"Slow service, incorret orders, and once you get your food you seldom see tbe server again.  Ive been 8 times since I moved nearby, tried take out twice. I was offered 2 free meaks for poor service, never could get them. I work nights and eat at 24 hr places about twice a week.  I go to Stapley even though this Dennys is only a mile my house"}
{"text":"I am sad to Say this place is horrible!!!! My family and I went out for a pre Valentines dinner and received absolutely horrible service and were subjected to even worse food!! My burger fell apart the instant I picked it up off my plate, my 6 year old ordered breakfast with a side of bananas and when her food came out there were no bananas when bought to the attention of staff they brought her a plate of fries straight out of the fryer instead which she ofcourse instantly burned herself on. When I asked to speak to a manager I was brushed off by many staff members while the manager sat in a booth talking to other people for atleast 20 minutes!! When i finally got rude and demanded to speak to management the manager put on his coat and walked out the door while someone who I only assume was an employee (he was not in any way in uniform)came to ask me how he could help. This place is a joke!!!! Sad this WAS my families favorite restaurant but we will NEVER be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I know this is a Denny's, but I still expect a level of some sort of professionalism. Friday night, dinner hour, people with young kids all around. The staff was so out of control with their behavior it was disgusting. The hostess is just standing there talking to a waitress saying \"shit girl hook me up\" so loud everyone could hear. Another waitress was point blank yelling at the kitchen staff so the entire restaurant could hear. Cussing. I mean, really? That's how you conduct yourself at work? Got there at 6, seated right away, 15 minutes before we are acknowledged, order taken, ONE HOUR LATER, food finally comes, only after the non existent waitress we had states \"oh ya'll been waiting a while, let me go check\" took another 30 minutes to get our check, because the waitress was busy talking to the hostess. I thought the IHOP in this area was bad, this place was worse. Never again."}
{"text":"I think this is the first time I've been to the North Olmsted restaurant and I loved it! I was waiting for my car to get serviced down the road and stopped in to grab a bite to eat. Super nice waitress, great food and it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Bc it's on the strip, it's super busy so it's obvious food will have a small wait. Staff is friendly and restrooms were clean tho"}
{"text":"Went early on a Saturday morning, first issue was the guy that sat us (gray shirt) couldn't care less and barely spoke. I saw him do the same including throwing down the menus with the table next to me.  Second, it was busy but not bad enough for it to take 10+ minutes to see the waitress, finally got my order in and waited. Noticed she was spending most of her time talking to another table, another waitress brought my food.  Got the food and it was disappointing, the pancakes sat too long and were room temp.  The hashbrowns were decent and the sausage gravy left a weird aftertaste for an hour afterwards.  Finally went up to pay and the cashier again couldn't care less, barely spoke while I paid. I think I'll stick with Waffle House, it costs more but the people are friendly and the food is a lot better."}
{"text":"I like Denny's as they have many items that are diet friendly. I had the Veggie skillet and it was very tasty. They have quick service and friendly servers. This is a good consistent spot for a nice breakfast."}
{"text":"Had the sausage skillet was good but the toast came later and was butterd on one side"}
{"text":"The waitress was good as always, but the cook was off today . I ordered a well done steak , and received a juicy, dripping blood, rare steak. I didn't complain and tried to handle it thinking the rest would be cooked, until I realized the whole half of my steak was rare. After asking the manager for help on the bill, he rudely snatched the bill and said \" we're not taking off the whole thing\" and walked away as if the steak didn't look rare. When he came back with the rearranged balance, he asked if I was done eating while grabbing the plate at the same time I was taking the last few bites of the hash browns I could take before he grabbed the plate. This place is usually on point with costumer service and food quality, but today was different."}
{"text":"They we really busy when I came n to pick up my order the manager on duty helped me right away the only reason I rated them a three is because my order was wrong when I got home and I had to come back with no compensation.. Almost perfect"}
{"text":"Arrived and had to wait 15 minutes for a table of two which is always a good sign I guess as it was real busy at about 11.15. Shown to a table we were then left to look at menus for about 15 minutes, too long to keep people waiting but upon our orders being taken the waiter apologised which was fine as they were busy. Waited a LONG time for drinks and it did get a little annoying, however when they came (Delicious!). Food came shortly after this and all was good! Very generous portions, however a little bit cold, but still great food!   Our waiter was as attentive as he could be although he was extremely rushed off his feet and we also couldn't help looking to see that he was receiving a lot of complaints from one table which was a shame as he looked like he was really trying! The place was very chaotic amongst staff so I do believe management ought to look into how they allocate their staff around the restaurant!   When we received our bill the drinks had been removed which was nice of the waiter to do as a good will as our experience was quite lengthy. Many thanks to him!"}
{"text":"I always go to this place for dinner or breakfast  with my family, usually  it's the same service but today (Cassandra) served us in have never seen her but she was extremely  friendly and nice definitely  going back when she is there thank you for your great service"}
{"text":"The food here is good and delicious but very crowded. Maybe has to do with the amount of goodness but a little too crowded."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome meal here and our server Tiva was the best! We got a burger, omelet and grandslamwhich! The 5 stars is for Tiva expecially."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch while on vacation. Food was good and service was excellent. Strongly recommend for a quick lunch. Zachery is an amazing server."}
{"text":"WARNING!!! FOOD POISONING!!!  On 4/24/2013 my hubby got violently sick from their bacons. We ate exactly the same thing till the night before, he went to this Denny's for breakfast alone on that morning, ate nothing else, and came back to the hotel sick, so we know for sure it's from this Denny's. He burped and threw up the bacon taste all day. Also he said the waitress lied they had no wifi, then said the manager told her not to tell the passcode."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast instead of the usual Bob Evans.  Had a good meal.  Coffee was good and strong and the cup was thick ceramic, which kept the coffee hot. Other bright spots were the pancakes, which were fluffy and light with good flavor and the wheat toast, which was a nice texture and not the dense, square cut sandwich bread.  Restaurant was clean and service was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a mystery. After the remodel, the first few times we went there, the food and service was outstanding. The last three times, both food and service have been subpar. Whether they were short-staffed or just overwhelmed by the volume of patrons, somehow the management has to figure out how to make sure customers aren't waiting 45 minutes for food once the order is placed. I'll give it another shot in hopes they heed the reviews."}
{"text":"Not busy and the service is bad we sit here for 10 mins before they get our drink order and then after we order it takes 40 mins to get our food.  Not a good day at dennys"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there with my little brother. My little brother has really long blonde hair, which sometimes gets mistaken for a girl. It's fine. It's a common mistake.  Anyway, we sat down at our table and everything was fine. The host was wonderful and made us feel welcome. Our waitress comes over and starts calling both of us miss and ladies. I politely informed her that my little brother was infact, not a girl, because I could see it was bothering him. The waitress just stared at me with the blankest look and rudely said, \"okay...\" No sorry. No laughing it off. Nothing! She then took our drink/food and I didn't even want a drink at that point, I just wanted to leave.  We sat there deciding what to do. My little brother said he was okay an wanted to stay. I wasn't having it. I finally nicely asked the host if he could cancel our order, since my waitress was going to every other table but mine. I could tell the host was concerned and asked us if we just wanted to move to another section and he would personally take care of us. My little brother and I agreed. We went to the section of the waitress we had last time we went there. She was so nice and remembered our exact order! The host kept coming over to check on us and kept making my little brother laugh. I finally told him what the problem was with the first waitress. He was shocked! I'm giving it a 5 star because everything else was wonderful, beside the first waitress. Some people aren't meant to work with customers. She should find a new job. Wish I got her name, so I could warn all of you!!"}
{"text":"We opted for this restaurant because other restaurants in the area were full, and there were no cars outside the restaurant.  We were seated promptly, and the waiter promptly came to our table dancing a little jig.(Odd) When I quizzically looked at him, he said that the little dance was fun for him and the customers. (Maybe for him) Our drinks were served in dinghy looking glasses that should have been an omen of what this dining experience was going to be like. I ordered the salmon with cheesy mashed potatoes, sweet corn, and garlic bread.  The food took forever to cook (They probably had to wake up the cook) and when it was finally served the salmon was a dried up gray piece of shoe leather.  When I complained, the waiter brought back some garlic butter as the solution.  Suffice it say that the meal was so bad that the corn was the best part. But this dining experience got better.  When paying the bill, the cashier asked if I wanted leave a tip.  I indicated 15% out of common courtesy. When I got the receipt I noticed that the tip was $4.50 on a $21.00 bill. I confronted the cashier who shrugged and said his math must be bad, and gave me a dollar back. It was the perfect end to a way less than perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"First of all the Architecture inside this Dennys is second to none. I've been in 40 states across this country and this one is second to none.  The service is unparalleled and Gus the cook gets out food correct everytime, he's the best."}
{"text":"It was rough my friend's burger had to be remade 2 times because they kept putting cheese on it and they didn't give us silverware until we asked."}
{"text":"Sat down with my buddie for a late night dinner, I was starving and thought a 10oz sirloin sounded good, the waiter was a absolute joke, a kid who looked like he needed a nap , came over took our order ..he knew nothing about the menu or the sides that came with it, when i got my meal he never brought over any steak sauce, or anything had to ask him for EVERYTHING. then he asked for my visa but the guy never ran it. the food was good actually but the service just isnt gonna fly."}
{"text":"Love this Denny's! It is always clean and the wait staff is excellent. We often go after 9pm and it is always pretty busy, but we haven't had to wait to be seated. The food is standard Denny's food."}
{"text":"The super bird is the best dish :) who doesn't love Dennys?? they have amazing breakfast, very good coffee and a variety of Meals. The Fries are one of the best out there..."}
{"text":"Stopped today had the turkey dinner. Absolutely unbelievable good portion, excellent taste, $9.99, great value. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went this morning and it took forever for someone to even notice we were there. Then the bacon was cold and drenched in oil. Oil that tasted old and burnt. It was disgusting. The only thing we liked were the pancakes and orange juice haha. This place sux ass!"}
{"text":"Came here late night to try something simple with my boyfriend ,  place was empty. Half of the tables still had the dirty plates. The cooks were screaming in Spanish , the manger was screaming something about bacon very unprofessional. Our meal wasn't the best the eggs were horrible!!!! When  I told our server \" Leslie\"   she was very rude about it . Never coming back here again! Sticking to iHop !"}
{"text":"I love going to Denny's for a late night coffee with my sweetheart. Diner food is good, good service and clean."}
{"text":"Ate here a few days ago. Food was decent, nothing special. What WAS special, on the other hand, was our server Shannon. Easily one of the most attentive waiters we've had in Las Vegas. Big smile, great attitude, and funny as hell. Even though the food took a lot longer than expected, he was there every step of the way to make sure we were in the loop. I can't say enough good things about him. Good job on a great hire, Denny's!"}
{"text":"This Denny's was remodeled and it looks great!!  The food and service were good!!  Would recommend."}
{"text":"15 minutes after we sit down, waitress decides to have an attitude.  We leave and she walks away like  no loss to them.  Ok, 2 am, I'll yelp that I will not be back.  Don't bother, find an IHOP!"}
{"text":"We are loyal patrons for breakfast here but will never return for dinner after tonight.  In fact I am writing this review from the Red Robin in the same shopping center.  My wife ordered Chili and onion rings and I ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  Twenty minutes later they brought her chili and I kid you not, it looked like a bowl of dog food.  She sent it back.  A few minutes later, the waitress comes by to tell me that the Chef said he may not have any meatballs.....  Unbelievably disappointing. Marc"}
{"text":"We had a nice waitress but my chicken was dry, they messed up my order. Also the hash browns were under cooked."}
{"text":"Yep , I went to Denny's and it was a pleasant surprise. I was happy to see the build your own grand slam on the menu. If your on a low carb diet this is perfect.  You have 4 choices i chose two orders of eggs and 2 orders of sausage.  There are about 8 choices to select  pancakes, bacon , hash ,grits , toast etc can't remember them all.       Anyway it was nice to just pick and chose instead of the usual , playing the substituiton game.   I gave it the third star for the build your own slam option, ok .  It made me happy that's what counts , Thank you"}
{"text":"This was my first time to this Denny's location, I was hesitant about going because I haven't been the biggest fan of their food, however I'm glad I went! I ordered breakfast food, The Grand Slamwich, and it was amazing! To be honest my food came out looking just like the picture advertised (which never happens), and tasted even better than it looked!"}
{"text":"The most horrible experience ever!! Was seated and sat there for half a hour and left with no service what so ever ..this post makes u pick a star but they don't even deserve a star!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Avoid if possible!!! Long Waits and extremly dirty dishes. Disgusting! We told the supervisor, but she did nor care."}
{"text":"Overall i would say this is your average dennys and i have eaten at plenty to know it is pretty hard to find a perfect dennys there is something usually not up to standards. The service i found was pretty good polite and efficient. The fodd was not bad but definatley not great the eggs benedict i ordered was suppose to be sofy and came out medium as well there was about three times to much hollandaise  sauce even after the bennys were gone and soaked up as much as i could with my hashbrowns there was about a half a cup s5ill on my plate. My daughters chocolate chip pancakes were good but its pretty hard to mess pancakes up even for a dennys cook. Not so certain i would return."}
{"text":"Been coming to this Dennys for years. It's usually good but sometimes the service could be better. But for the most part it a decent place to go to when you're up at 2am when nothing else is open."}
{"text":"Maybe the service could be better since in Puerto Rico they treated me much much better and its a bit sad since Denny's is one of my favorites places to eat overall love the fodd"}
{"text":"Early morning breakfast or would it be late night breakfast? Lol  Idk  But it was good and our waitress was very nice I wish I was more awake at the time but she was great  All I know was she appreciated milk with ice in it"}
{"text":"DONT GO! Terrible experience overall.  Understaffed. They were out of several things that we wanted. Waited an hour to get our food that wasn't right. Then waited another 20 min for our daughter to have syrup for her pancakes. No refills came and when my husband asked she forgot.  We asked to see the manager and she told us he would yell at her and she wasn't going to get him.  I told her it wasn't her fault because they were so understaffed she was spread too thin and I needed to see him. He was not very accommodating and did not do enough to make us satisfied. We haven't been there in years and now we will never go back again. Oh...and I've been sick all night....bonus!"}
{"text":"Still have no idea what the negative reviews are about. Its Denny's. You should know what you are getting into. The food I receive here is what I expect, and the service has been fine. I eat here a couple times a month from times that range from 3 a.m to 1 p.m. I have no problems at all recommending this Denney's location."}
{"text":"The only reason that this Denny's earned 4 stars is because of our waitress, Kira. She was very sweet and hustled her hardest to please and serve all 7 of her tables in a timely and efficient manner. Although you could sense the anxiousness, she did a great job of keeping everybody happy, despite the fact that her manager did the bare minimum to help her staff. In fact, we were seated by one of the kitchen staff, who came out to help Kira. (I don't recall her name, but she was as helpful a hostess/waitress as she could be without the title. The food came out quicker than we got seated, so that is a plus in my book. Thank you Kira! I'll be sure to ask for her when I return."}
{"text":"This place is great! I was sick on Christmas day and so my family wasn't getting an extravagant home cooked meal. So we went to Denny's instead and I was very impressed with the service and the food. Our take-away meals were put together great and  they were still very warm when we got home. I ordered the Macho Nacho Burger and was NOT disappointed.  I was very happy that there was a place open so I didn't have to cook."}
{"text":"This location is ok except their cooks are inexperienced. I ordered a Super Bird and the bread was super hard. plus, it was supposed to come with cheese and it had no cheese. I want CHEESE ! The Server was nice tho. I probably won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This new 24-hour Denny's location opened earlier this week (Feb 1)and clearly a lot of people were anxiously waiting for it to open. There was a line up shortly after we got there and the restaurant quickly filled up by 8:30 am.   The restaurant is medium sized with a small breakfast bar at the front. The seating arrangement is fairly comfortable, although it is difficult to get around when the restaurant is packed. Booths surround the restaurant walls and tables and chairs fill in the rest of the space.  The decor is pleasant and the restaurant is family-friendly.   We were seated right away but did not like the location (by the restrooms)  so we asked to be moved. They graciously accommodated us. They took our drink order and left us to look over the menu, which was very plentiful. It was more elaborate than we expected. The options are not the usual breakfast items you see at other restaurants, like Cora's; it's super fancy and the prices reflect that.  It's definitely pricer then other places. More like $$$.   I ordered the breakfast special of eggs, bacon, hash browns and pancakes.  The eggs were ok as were the bacon and hash browns. But the blueberry pancakes were AMAZING!! They were properly cooked and fluffy and filled with delicious blueberries. I would go back just for the pancakes!! I will go back to try the lunch and dinner items and slip in a blueberry pancake.    One last thing - the staff are friendly enough but it's clear they need more practice and time to handle the volume of customers. The couple behind us was complaining about how slow they were in coming around to top up coffees or check in on how they were doing.  They were also slow in cleaning up recently vacated tables. Hopefully this will get better with time."}
{"text":"Tried calling an order to go. First time I was asked to hold & the person on the other end set down the phone. After 5 minutes of hearing people talking & not being helped, I hung up. Called back about 5 mins later & it was busy (most likely because the phone was still off the hook). Waited 10 minutes & called again. Again I was asked to hold & the phone got set down. & again they forgot to come back. I wouldn't have called back a third time (& shouldn't have) but it was late & I really didn't want to cook.  So finally after the third time calling, they took my order. One of the items I asked for a side of Mac & cheese but they were out. Not that big of a deal. Anyway I drive to pick up my order & they tell me that one of the meals I ordered for my husband was discontinued. He said they just sold out of the last batch. Wtf?! It was stuffed French toast that was just put on the menu for the holidays.  They didn't even offer anything for my hassle & their mistake.  Not eating there anymore. Such poor service!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews but for me personally it's been a good experience every time I have come to this Denny's with my husband and son. The customer service is good and we usually get our orders in a timely manner. The only thing I can comment on for improvement is the cleanliness of this location. While the place is generally clean it can be better for sure the washrooms need a little more attention and the tables should be wiped down with cleaner cloths as the tables tend to have wipe stains after they are wiped. Otherwise nice, friendly atmosphere to go for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it was awful. I can't find anything good to say. On the last visit, and it WILL be the last, I had the following problems: (1) the table was dirty and it took THREE requests to get the wait staff to clean it (2) it took a very long time to get our food even though the place had few people in it (3) the food was cold (4) the orders were not complete (5) the food was not good. How on earth to you make a bad egg? (5) the waitress was highly annoying. If you are forced to choose between not eating and going to this Denny's, I earnestly suggest you consider the benefits of fasting."}
{"text":"I am always treated special here.  The wait staff always remember you.  They work hard to please and the food is great."}
{"text":"It's our first time in Vegas and the US so had to check Dennys out. We went for breakfast on our first day and was really impressed, fast service and the food tasted good. I had build your own breakfast with hash browns, eggs, bacon and toast. The next day we went again but the food was not so good. The hash brown was a QUARTER of the size. We thought we'd try 1 more time and it got worse. So we won't be going back. I understand this location only opened recently but they need to get there portion sizes sorted.  Warning to all brits. Do not try 'grits' we only ordered it because we've seen it on TV and in movies. It's really disgusting. From what I can tell it's a savoury porridge with butter on the top. It made both of us feel instantly sick."}
{"text":"Great seats and fabulous view of Vegas and the outside water fountain.    Breakfast was good. But Just wished it came out more heated.   The booth we say at had a lot of food and crumbs on the floor.   Service was not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Came in for a Saturday morning meal after 2 days of hospital food during our stay at sunrise hospital after our daughter Emmalynn was born. The place was decorated with lots of saint Patricks day decor and it's not even march yet , but I find this nice because it shows the employees have pride in their work place. The hostess greeted me immediately and I ask to sit at the counter. The waitress was very friendly and took my order very quickly. I was sitting next to two gentlemen that appeared to be regulars. The waitress knew them by name and they seemed to feel right at home. My food came quickly and was cooked perfectly. This place has that cozy mom and pop cafe feel even though it is a large chain."}
{"text":"Well we been long timers coming to this Dennys and have never been disappointed in staff or service here on top of how exceptionally clean the place is. They just remodeled and looks fantastic. Give the great praise to the owners seeing they remodel about every 6 years to keep up to date."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment compared to other Dennys I've visited across the country. Server never asked how our food was. My hash browns were undercooked, scrambled eggs cold and the food looked like it had just been thrown on the plate. The server was almost trying to rush us to order and to pay the bill. A table next to us sadly dropped a glass and they were slow to tidy the mess up. Even when they did \"clean\" it they left loads of shards of glass on the floor by our table."}
{"text":"Do not recommend this place.  It used to be decent,  but apparently it's really gone downhill.  We came in around 9 pm and it wasn't super busy,  but there were several messy tables just sitting there and no silverware at our table. We placed our orders and got our drinks, and then just sat and sat there waiting. Other people who arrived after us got their food. No one came over to check on us after we got drinks. After an hour of waiting and trying to get someones attention, we discovered that our food order was never put in! Needless to say, we left."}
{"text":"This place sucks they need new cooks at night. The waiter was nice tho she help as much as possible. we got a burger and a prim rib sandwich my burger was cold and her sandwich had barley anything on it. The cooks were back there screaming and singing. It took 25 min too get out food. Every time we come her at night it takes forever to get our food."}
{"text":"Hour and a half wait.  Ugh.  Still waiting for food.  I imagine it's not easy to manage people no-showing for work but yikes.  Bathrooms are dirty and run down.  Please get me out of here."}
{"text":"Had to wait an hour for my to-go order that was a pancake meal with eggs and a burger. Also when o finally relieved my order they forgot the pancakes and by the time I got home (only 5 minutes away) my food was already cold. Horrible service"}
{"text":"only Denny's i know that can do the Eggs the way i like and the Red Skin Roasties the way i like....Great place, nice staff and SUPER bust on saturday and Sundays..ALL DAY!"}
{"text":"This past Thursday, we (as in myself, my brother, and my 2 daughters) were in the mood for breakfast food for dinner.  We went to the IHOP on Woodlawn, but they were super busy and there was a line.  So, we decided to head over to Denny's.  I have only eaten at this Denny's once before and I was mildly disappointed.  However, that was a year ago and I figured I would give them another chance.  We arrived around 9:30pm.  At the time, they were not very busy...only a few tables had customers.  We placed our order and waited.  Our order consisted of pancakes, a turkey sandwich, and an egg and sausage skillet.  Thirty minutes had gone by and we did not hear anything.  At this point, the restaurant had gotten busier.  We asked our waitress (who was also the restaurant's manager) why it was taking so long.  She explained that they were not prepared for the rush and they had to prep the food because nothing was prepared yet.  I said that was fine and we waited.  While we are waiting, my daughters are noticing that other people, who arrived after us, were getting their meals first.  So, I spoke with the manager again.  She said that they were still preparing our food.  I asked the manager if, considering the inconvenience, if she could discount the meal.  She said that the best she could do was 10%.  So, I say that is fine and we wait some more.  It was now 10:35pm!  Over an hour had past and we still have not received our food.  At this point, we told the manager that we had to go because I had to get my daughters to bed for school the next day.  She said that was fine and we left.  To be clear, our waitress/manager was not rude in anyway.  She just did not seem to care whether we were there or not.  She never checked on us nor did she offer an explanation regarding the delay.  Not to mention, our order was pretty simple to make.  This was some of the worst customer service I have ever received and we will never go back there again.  Thank God there was a Chili's next door.  We got some hamburgers (which were REALLY good) and our waitress was a life saver.  We told the waitress about our ordeal at the Denny's and she could tell that we were all exhausted.  So, even though the kitchen was closing (it was almost 11:00pm at this point), she gave us time to figure out what we wanted and got our food to us within 15 minutes.  That's how you run a restaurant.  But Denny's?...Never again."}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars if I could. I understand that they are busy, but this place had horrible service. We were lucky that they even brought out water for us because we didn't even receive the coffee that we ordered for over an hour. After being told several times that the food is almost ready, the waiter brought out half of our order after an hour of sitting there and NOT being checked on. The food was cold and looked liked it had been sitting out for days. The eggs, steak, burger, and fries were completely cold! We decided to bring the Manager over to voice our concerns. He then told us that he can re-make the food and have it out within 7 minutes! 7 Minutes? If it only took 7 minutes to cook our food then why did it take over an hour to only receive half of our order? Both our server and the Manager were extremely rude and we will never be back. Seriously, you cant even bring a cup of coffee out?? Horrible place."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I am still sitting at my table. I must say that the service is amazing! The manager Rodney came to our table asking if we need anything shortly after we placed our order. Our waitress, Sweet was the sweetest! She had so much positive attitude. I have been to many Denny's and the food and service wasn't the greatest. We ordered the molten lava cake and 2 of the hushpuppy sundae. It was really good and satisfied my sweet tooth! Will come back"}
{"text":"Why would they close the Dennys  in Brampton? Sup 2/10 management. Just another example of the Large 24 hour breakfast chain capitalists oppressing the meek of society. By far the worst business of all time. I would be willing to excuse such a poor choice if you would gladly reimburse me far such a loss with some free shit."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary with the 2 4 6 at Denny's, Oh yea. Now if they could that around here on the west side. Too bad you have to go all the way to Fremont st but this place was great. I will be returning the next time I am in town!!!!"}
{"text":"Worse place ever! Our server was coughing while she was taking our order. Took forever to get our food and we had to get up to get our ticket to leave . Our server was talking about her work problems with the guest next to us I never been to a very poor service place I will never stop by here again."}
{"text":"Denny's is Denny's. It's cheap and efficient.  But like all chain restaurants that's about it.  The food is ok. The service was good.   I came here because the casinos took my money. This was what was left over in the wallet.   No regrets."}
{"text":"My family are visiting from Australia and love the American Diner experience. At lunchtime we had good service, they were accommodating to our kids individual requests and the food quality better than any theme park we have recently visited. Also have healthy options for adults so you don't always have to go for the lumberjack slammer (although it's tempting). Went on to visit The Venetian, Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio so great location. Thank you."}
{"text":"I cant tell you how many times ive eaten at Jenny's late at night on various substances and completely enjoyed myself. The service at this particular dennys is exceptionally friendly and the food is way better than ihop"}
{"text":"Worst managers ever after getting nasty food and sending it back she tried to fight with us over a 20% off cupon... Needless to say I'll stick to the one in harmarville they are so much nicer"}
{"text":"As stated by several other reviewers the wait staff is good, especially Jenny. However, as also stated by several the store is kind of old and dingy and really needs a refurbishment. But what this store really needs is management that doesn't have a cranial rectal insertion problem. The most recent on his part is the change in acceptance of the 'free meal after ten stamps' program with no notice and no effective by date. When asked about it he informed me \"I put it up and no consideration to the fact that I had two cards ready to be used. The equivalent of forty meals purchased considering I always have at least one person with me. Just bad customer service IMHO!  Won't be back till this store has new management."}
{"text":"Exceptionally slow.  Took an hour to get food.  The wait staff were barking orders to cooks.  Pretty dirty too, especially the restrooms.  No soap..."}
{"text":"Server: Rayshawn and Manager: William On 9,4/2016 I came to Denny's to have a late lunch. Everything was going well until the server asked for my credit card, and how much I wanted to leave as a tip. It seemed kind of unusual because in all restaurants they bring you the ticket, and you leave whatever you think the server deserves. In this time the server came left the credit card, and the ticket, I then realized that the server charged 4 dollars' gratuity on a ticket that was $8.47 plus tax and $4.00 gratuity which I did not authorized. I immediately asked for the manager. The server was nowhere to be found. When the manager approached me I started explaining that what YOU referring to the store he then he started arguing who is YOU. He then repeated the same phrase every time I was telling him about YOU referring to the store or the team at that store. He never apologized to me, and he refunded me the tip, because I asked for it. I told him that the server did not deserve a tip for the game he was playing. I think Denny's should look into the management staff in this store, I will never go back to this store, and you better believe I will leave a bad review in other web sites about the way I was treated, not only by what the server did, but the poor quality management from this store. I have been in a lot of Denny's, but I have never been treated like this in my life, Worst manager ever,"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this establishment in a while. They had an advertisement on their windows on fluffier pancakes, so my wife and I stopped. The breakfast and service was good. The pancakes were BOMB.com, will definitely stop by again for breakfast."}
{"text":"We were here to eat our breakfast, unfortunately our server is to busy doing nothing there was only us in the restaurant and after 15 minutes there was another party, for some reason the food was taken a long time, for just three tables in the restaurants I think they need more supervision during that time it seems like it's lack of management. I don't recommend to stop by in this place again during this hours."}
{"text":"I understand being on the strip it's gonna be a bit busy and loud. The fact that the cooks can't keep up on orders and I had to wait for the most basic items of my breakfast is why the rating is 1 star. Honestly having to wait for toast and pancakes when the eggs, hash browns and meat are already at the table"}
{"text":"Good food but awful service. They sat us next to the kitchen area and the staff was beyond loud talking nonsense. It was pretty busy and most of us were sitting around waiting for our waiters to acknowledge us. They need more structure and better customer service."}
{"text":"I mean, it's Denny's, guys.  Not sure a Denny's can score more than 3-3.5 stars no matter what.  This was is fine.  Decent staff, decent food.  Meh.  I can say though....... GREAT for small children.  There were TONS, many were crying, fussing, yelling, walking on the booths etc.  I had my boob out and was breastfeeding the entire time I was in here and no one except one lame looking couple cared.   We wish our water would have been refilled more.  Had to go up to counter and ask for bill because our server was very busy with another 9 top.  just meh.  husband and i got our once yearly Denny's craving out of the way for not too much B.S.  3 stars"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice, food was good but it shouldn't take 5 min to get a soda. I got the French toast slam. I asked for eggs on a separate plate but they didn't do it. The hash browns were amazing. The syrup is ridiculous... They have it in an olive oil dispenser and it took infinity to come out."}
{"text":"Update: although this experience does not make me want to return, the manager did contact me, was very apologetic and wanted to make things right. I appreciated the manager taking ownership of the situation and so quickly. // If you want overpriced, overly greasy burnt food, this is the place to go! Never have a seen a pancake burnt so badly and neither the cook or the wait staff saw an issue with it before serving it."}
{"text":"I see a lot of bad reviews but I will give credit where it's due. Came here because I stayed at the hotel behind it. Food good, staff nice and attentive, and service was fast."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go the nearest Denny's, which so happen to be the one on the Vegas strip. It was near midnight and the strip was packed on a Saturday night. We were a group of seven women. We walked into the Denny's and were quickly greeted and seated at a table. The restaurant was nice and clean and had a warm and friendly ambiance. The restaurant wasn't packed but had about five groups of about 4 people per table.   We were quickly approached by our waitress Cynthia S., an elderly woman with glasses and a messy bun. She was extremely friendly and happy. She made us feel so comfortable and took care of us so very well. She asked for our drinks and went around the table and treated everyone so diligently while taking our drinks. She came back quickly with them and took our order. She complimented everyone on their choice and made sure  everyone's sides were the sides they wanted. She quickly came back with the food and everything was outstanding! In looks, quality, and portion. Everyone's plates looked exactly like the picture in the menu. Most of us ordered off of the dinner menu; chicken fried steaks, philly melts, and nachos. She made many jokes and checked up on us constantly throughout our dinner. I ordered the Banana Walnut Pancakes; exceptional! The 3 pancakes were large, all the same size, perfectly golden brown, fluffy, and hot. The egg whites were fluffy and perfectly cooked. The turkey bacon was a little crisp but not over-cooked. I was even more impressed when I realized the walnuts within my pancakes were fresh, crisp, and candied and the bananas on top were nice and fresh and not brown or too ripe. The portions were amazing compared to the price! My plate costed $8.50 and my Berry Lemonade $2.89. My total came out to $11.38 for exceptional food. I had a 20% coupon, so I actually only ended up spending $9.84 (including tax).   Cynthia S. was amazing and I feel so bad the group only tipped her $15. I absolutely feel like we shorted her. The total bill for everyone was $101. I've promised myself to not tip according to the 15% rule from now on. I believe a tip is what you think your waiter or waitress deserved and I think Cynthia deserved more than 15% for her outstanding service. I'll be sure to make up for my mistake when I go back.   Not only was Cynthia amazing, the ENTIRE staff was extremely kind to us. While waiting for our food, I decided to play a game with the group which required some writing on napkins. I didn't have a pen so I asked a young man who worked there as he passed by our table. He uncomfortably said he only had one with a smile but gave it to me anyway and when I asked him if he needed it he said no. Lol I'm sure he did, but he sacrificed his pen for our satisfaction. And when we got up to pay our bill the young man at the register was incredibly kind as he joked with us and asked about the food. Not to mention the other elderly waiter who greeted us and asked about or night while Cynthia was getting our food.   Overall, Denny's is a wonderful restaurant chain. The one on the Las Vegas strip is outstanding and I recommend everyone to dine at any Denny's, and not hesitate to visit the one on the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Always a fan of Denny's, and this one is a great location, right off 401, it's larger as well so no need to wait, good service, coffee well done, I ordered the Original Grand Slam that's my favorite"}

{"text":"came here after bad experience at ihop.  fast service, clean silverware, got the order right, good and fast cook, will come back here often"}
{"text":"Freezer burnt frozen veggies and unseasoned fish for $15, sorry I won't be back. I quite enjoy humpty's breakfast from time to time so I don't think my expectations are overly high diner food but this food was awful."}
{"text":"On honeymoon and despised to stop at Denny's for breakfast. I have always liked Denny's breakfast up until now. First waited five minutes to be seated and ten minutes to take my order. They did not have what I wanted but is showed a charge on my bill for it. The server was rude and didn't even take my order right. And the bill was brought to the table before I was finished eating. what if I wanted to order something else. Bottom line I will not be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"Before I get started, I know I should not have gone for dinner at Denny's!!  The breakfasts are great but dinner was horrible. I had the bourbon steak skewers. There was so much bourbon sauce on the plate, it was running everywhere. Why must a restaurant use instant mashed potatoes!! They were terrible.  Surly it would not only be cost affective but taste  so much better if they would make there own mashed potatoes. Service was good as usual but they really need to improve the dinner."}
{"text":"Not much to say but good service from Denny's. Usually it's pretty bland here, but that wasn't the case. Everyone was friendly and the place was clean. Upon leaving the manager asked us how are day was and was extremely funny and nice. Surprisingly for a Sunday morning they were not that busy."}
{"text":"Horrible service, sat for 7 minutes, no hello, be right there, no acknowledgement. Will never return, if you value your time do not go here"}
{"text":"Denny's is a great place if you're a student! We order their oreo milkshake which was delicious. and a hot chocolate with was okay. For food we shared a Big Slam. The pancakes were pretty good (They charge extra if you want chocolate chips in your pancakes!!), and so were the hash browns. The toast was not toasted enough and the bacon was greasy. The service was alright, there are not many waiters so it takes time to order. All in all its a great place for a quick snack or a late night bite !"}
{"text":"We are on a cross-country trip and made a stop in Las Vegas. Ate at a couple of Dennys on the way, LOVED IT, and decided to eat at the one here. Not impressed. I ordered the Tilapia Ranchero dinner. Once it arrived, there was NO spice added to the fish. None. It was whiter than white on rice, on a paper plate in the middle of an Alaskan snowstorm.   Whoever cooked it obviously didn't know the recipe. I informed the waitress the fish was nothing as advertised and she offered me another, even though we had appetizers and other items, which came at the same time as the entree..all at once. Was not interested in getting another entree. The rest of the food was good, the fish was not to my liking in its plain form unseasoned form. We paid the bill and moved on... Will NOT be eating at this one again..."}
{"text":"Food was cold, took way too long to get served. Standard breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, hash browns, bacon. Wasn't expecting much but a little good service since there were only four tables of customers. No luck! No check back, no water or coffee refills and really felt I was invisible while the waitresses socialized with whom I suspect were friends. Waited 15 minutes after I was done with my meal and finally I tagged a different waiter and told him I've been waiting for ever for someone to come over. His response was, it's not his fault he just came on duty.  No coming back here."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Decor- typical american style diner like Applebees or IHOP or Ruby Tuesdays. You get the point right?  Service- Average  Price/Value- Pretty good! Large servings for the price you pay  Food- Fish and chips with a side of macaroni and cheese. 4/5 For $13 i got two huge pieces of fish and a side of potato wedges. a small bowl of mac and cheese and last but not least two slices of garlic bread. I definitely left stuffed and very satisfied.  I would definitely come here again to try the veggie burger, a friend said it's really good and I saw that his veggie burger was loaded with mushrooms and i sure love me some mushrooms! Maybe i'll come here for the free birthday grand slam as well!"}
{"text":"Dennys is reliable. And the food is good. It has been good to me and my family on many occasions. We have been here on a regular basis on weekday and weekends and many holidays too! We are always treated nicely and accommodated.The wait is quick and we are always seated where we wanted to be. I love their new All you can eat buttermilk pancakes! Hands down they're some of the best. And if you have time and a good appetite the Skillets are excellent too! All the staff are fantastic people. Say hello to Sandy and Mr. Steven! They are always very accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Although the food here is about what you'd expect from any Denny's, it's the staff here that have me returning to this location on occasion. Everyone I've dealt with is friendly, helpful, and efficient. These qualities are especially important when dragging three children out to eat. Not a lot of healthy options, but that's not exactly a shocker."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant with great management and staff!!! I took my daughter here the food was great and the game room was awesome kept her entertained :) will definitely go back again soon!!!"}
{"text":"The best Denny's I've ever been to! The food was absolutely fresh. We ordered veggie burgers with seasoned fries and some shakes. All of them tasted great."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING! Sticky dirty tables, asked to be moved to another table, that one had food on the seats.... Ordered waters they came with a nasty film on the rim of the glasses so we asked for to go cups for our beverages. The server was nice and apologetic however the restaurant is in need of some management as this seems to be the expectation from him/her. This is before the food even came out!!! Get your 'stuff' together, there are classes at UNLV if you need management training...."}
{"text":"I really love Danny's food!   Always fresh and very clean!"}
{"text":"I got to hand it to the staff, they are really patient and have to put up with a lot (keep in mind this is right next to ASU). I have so many stories I could tell of our late night adventures to Denny's. I usually ended up being designated driver, and had to be the one to apologize to the staff on behalf of my roommates.   I give it four stars because when we would go during the day (when they were sober), the staff seemed even more moody then the staff that runs night shifts."}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious breakfast cooked exactly as ordered. Our waitress was friendly, courteous and efficient. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is so trash, took an hour and a half to get an appetizer when there wasn't even 10 tables seated in the whole restaurant, also finished eating my entree before other people at my table got their food. Manager didn't seem to care at all. Would give -5 stars if it was possible. TRASH."}
{"text":"Great food. Horrific service. Took over 30 minutes to get our breakfast (regular orders. Nothing special). Manager was rude to other patrons and unapologetic when we inquired how much longer our food would take. The food came out delicious just took forever."}
{"text":"In the Flying J Travel Plaza. Clean, good quality food, fast service."}
{"text":"What the hell happened?  Went here again, exact same time of year, one of the same servers.... the place was dead and I see why!  The bar didn't have a bartender in the middle of the day, the service was horrible, the food was crap, even the girl at the cash register was rude.  Wow, what a decline.  Last year was so great, the place was rammed and times were good.  The worst turnaround I have ever seen.  How do you mess up a Denny's?  Wow."}
{"text":"Been here for an hour and haven't gotten a seat , the worker looked like they hopped the border yesterday ?"}
{"text":"My son and I are here having lunch and are extremely pleased with the food, and especially the service.   I've recently been to another Dennys in the same vicinity as this one and I will never go back.  My son has special needs and everyone has been more than accommodating his needs!!  We will definitely visit this restaurant again!!!  The staff clearly has regulars and they are so pleasant to each patron!   Don't see this very often anymore! !  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Petty manager. Go someplace else."}
{"text":"My family walked in and a waitress named Linda seated us.  She went to get the place mats and LICKED HER FINGERS to get them!!  Then another lady came by and told us Linda would be our waitress.  As we sat there talking about it, we realized that nobody even took a drink order after several minutes.  We discussed leaving, since that was gross, Linda licking her freaking fingers, and now would touch our stuff, so we did.  Walked out right there.  Terrible, Denny's.  Then I could not even report it to corporate because the store number could not be located. Bad bad bad all the way around!"}
{"text":"We come to Denny's almost every week and they are always consistent. Maribel is one of the best waitresses and she always remembers what we drink and eat, even if we haven't been here for a while.  The rest of the staff is friendly also."}
{"text":"to be honest.   i am  not very  sure what  to say,  i am  embraced of my  self  going and  eating there.  was  few  people drunk right by  the  door,  i  think they  come out of  the bars.     and the  food is not good at all.    the service was  fine,    but  not  a place that  i would never go again."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service no waiter or waitress had asked thousand times to get  napkins and no refill on coffee management did not refill our coffee food came out cold no attention to detail gave us a steak with no steak knife it's a very convenient place to eat but Terrible customer service I will give this place a one star and if I had the chance to speak to the store owner I would they need a little bit more training feel a little bit of racial tension in the air"}
{"text":"Dennys values their online customers  more than senior citizens and handicapped customers. This location Removed their handicapped parking spaces in favor of on line order pickup. Now handicapped is further away from  the entrance and there are fewer spots available, a further walk for those who are in need of close parking. I see the almighty dollar beats ease and accessibility in Dennys mind. I will be a IHOP customer in the future. Sent"}
{"text":"This restaurant was nice and quiet, not loud like a typical Denny's.  Emily was our server and she was great--friendly, accommodating and on top of her game.  My husband ordered the Bourbon Burger, and it was really gross.  It was overly sweet and the sauce just didn't mesh well with the burger.  Emily didn't bat an eyelash when we asked if he could switch it out for something else.  We have never, ever asked to switch a dish out at a restaurant, ever, but it was just inedible.  Anyway, she quickly brought out his mushroom swiss burger and it was much different--super awesome!  Oh, and we went on a Tuesday, so our kids at free.  That was a huge plus!  All in all we had an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Can I rate a qtr star? So bad  she forgot half the parties food order.  Eggs are all cold. Vegetarian breakfast came with sausage...wtf. Birthday boy waited 20 min for toast after cold eggs delivered.  I can't eat this bad breakfast. Beware of Denny's Amherst."}
{"text":"I have been to this Denny's three times since they opened for breakfast - everything was great - service, friendly staff, the manager is great, the food was great - no complaints.  Tonight was another story - I think the breakfast cooks are great - dinner not so much.  My soup was barely warm, the nachos were disgusting, my waitress (Savanna Rain) never came back to check on anything - once my food was delivered, I never saw her again.  Consequently, no tip.  My check total was $9.53 so I gave the cashier $20.03 - he gave me back $10.47.  I told him it should be $10.50 because I gave him the three cents so I would get quarters back.  He argued with me and could not figure out why I should get back $10.50.  If someone cannot make change, they should not be on a register.  I think I will take a break from Denny's - try again in a few months."}
{"text":"Christmas shopping and wrapping after work till 1am. Stop at denny's because I hadn't eaten since 9am before work; worst experience I ever had. Cook cranking bar hip hop over the Christmas music playing on speakers....so two different musics competing and thennnn; waitress never brings bill so we walk up to register to pay our waitress. She gives me one receipt and asks if I wanna add anything to it. I asked her don't I put that on receipt? She tells me no we have an old system and says here you can put it on this one and hands me a different receipt. Husband says I have cash for tip to me. I am now questioning the two different receipts and asked how much was my bill, how much did you charge me. Then she was fumbling through receipts and says oh I over charged you. Can I just give you cash back. I ask \"what do you mean, I don't understand, explain?\" She charged me 20% over my bill (Bill was 20$ that she handed me but then rang it for 24$ and change) Lol then SHE tells ME it wasn't for a tip it was a mistake (I didn't accuse her of anything i didn't say a word lol i just wanted to leave). I went back and took the 7$ off the table and left the 4$ she ACCIDENTALLY over charged me and felt her self worth. Lol what a experience. WOW! NEVER AGAIN! Food was less than ok as well."}
{"text":"so surprised why this Denny's is close to 5 star ratings, we went for breakfast. my husbands pancakes, eggs bacon or sausages were stiff like they microwaved the plate of the that was cooked a week early 4 times before we got there. I though by looking at the food the manager would be SHOCKED. NOPE he offered us free food that we declined and still made us pay for the plate. IHOP will be my new choice"}
{"text":"This place is Trash... weren't even greeted and was told to walk straight to the back, she had an attitude the whole time and was not happy that we were here. She refused to make us shakes as we see someone else getting one. She called her co-worker a b word and just bad. Never coming again because of her"}
{"text":"This Dennys is super convenient and is the best drunk food ever we were on Fremont all night partying very hard and this dennys came to our rescue as we all went inside and order a different things from breakfast to dinner after a salad they accommodated all of our needs and took great pride in giving us the best service on Fremont for a restaurant"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has so many good reviews every time I have been here with my family the always take forever they have brought out other people's food before our food and we got in,seated, and ordered first and the other people came sometime after. Dennys is just a horrible place to eat they have been going downhill for 20 years they have had so many problems and it still seems like they can't get there s*** together. We stop going to Dennys for long time we just decided to go back and give it another chance but nothing changes. They need  to just close the doors and start fresh"}
{"text":"Service is good, food is usually good. Can't beat the prices. Only problem I have is that there is a foul smell throughout the resturaunt."}
{"text":"I got off work late and am currently sitting at the counter at this Denny's because I was starving.  It's been 32 minutes since I sat down and no one has greeted me.  I've watched multiple tables walk out due to not receiving my food.  Even if they were understaffed and overworked someone could have greeted me or gotten me a beverage in those 30 minutes.  The manager who was working the kitchen had me directly in her eyeliner and didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"I occasionally come to Denny's because it is close to my hoise but when i do enjoy a late night rush, Paul my waiter numerous times  has been more than above and beyond even on the late rush to ask if everyrhing is alright. This Dennys gets it. Definitely will be back. THANKS for the great customer service."}
{"text":"I called this number and this damn lady was talking so fast I couldn't understand her so just for that one star I never want to talk to her again and their food isn't even good."}
{"text":"Usually this Denny's is on point with to go orders, but, today someone must have fell asleep when it came to cooking sides. Our hash browns were super browned to the point of being burnt. To top it off there were like a total of three spoons full given. I really hope this was just an 'off' day for the chefs in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever! My husband and I went to this location couple of times but today it was different. First we waited over 30 minutes just to order our food. We had to call for the waiter to come to our table to take the order. Then we waited over 40 minutes just to get the food. I actually called for the manager to ask when our food was coming. The manager had the nerves to say \"be patient\"  to me in front of everyone. I honestly couldn't believe how crappy the service was and how rude the manager was. When we finally got our food, it was not even cooked all the way. My husband got half cooked turkey sausage and my son got pickles in his sandwich even though we had told the waiter no pickles since my son is allergic to them. Finally we were done and ready to leave. I told the manager how rude he was and he had the audacity to tell me that I should be patient due to them being busy and also that he is trying to keep his temper in check due to him not wanting to go off on his workers. Honestly I have never in my life seen anything like it. I don't know how this man is even a manager. My husband and I will never ever go back to that place after the way we got treated today."}
{"text":"This is your typical Dennys. Open 24/7, typical chain restaurant food (not bad, but not 5 star dining), and decent staff. Their breakfast food is very good, as are their deserts, but lunch/dinner foods are just average. Also, this Dennys is located near a bunch of hotels, so the crowd is not always just locals. At night time and during the weekend, it is pretty crowded, so I would not recommed going at those times."}
{"text":"So what if it was after midnight? Never again. Restaurant was out of avocado which was on a featured menu item. No actual coffee creamers, had to put cream in sauce cups for customers. Iced coffee was a dollar more than standard coffee, and it was merely coffee poured over ice so it was warmed coffee instead of iced...what???  And lastly my partner's french toast platter had one single piece of french toast. Unacceptable at any hour. Will never ever be back."}
{"text":"Didn't really want to cook dinner myself on Christmas Day, and most other restaurants were closed early in the afternoon (if they even opened at all). Despite the high volume of customers and the long wait times (which is kind of expected when most other places are closed for the holiday), the service was friendly. The food was still hot when I got it. The price was reasonable.  The breakfast combo I got was delicious. The hash browns were cooked well. Oh, and the toast was perfect! I cannot count how many other breakfast joints that I have been to that cannot properly toast bread; really, it's not that hard! So many restaurants either burn the toast or under-cook it, or apply either way too much or way too little butter.  Given that I'll probably be just as lazy next Christmas, I would probably come here again next year."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Weare here most every Sunday. They have free Wi-Fi, & our food is always done just right. One big stupid decisions by management; they've replaced the paper towels in the bathroom with the thinnest  paper towels I've ever seen come out of a machine. You have to use five or six just to get your hands close to dry. Will be using 10 in the winter when you really don't want damp hands. The only other complaint that I ever have is that of one that I could make of nearly every restaurant. THE COFFEE IS TOO STRONG! AND BITTER! Please offer your customers a more mild coffee. We would really appreciate it and that would actually be cheaper for you!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have ever had at any restaurant. We came in for a hot breakfast. After waiting 50+ minutes, thinking at least the food would be fresh, we received 4 plates of cold food. A couple of items were scolding hot. I cut into my eggs and they were entirely raw. I cannot fathom how the outside of eggs can be cooked and the insides were raw. I have to imagine their stovetops/ovens are at improper temperatures. Definitely not up to food safety standards.  We requested to talk to a manager to see what he could do and he came out flustered and seemed like he didn't have time to talk. He had no interest in hearing about it. He said \"sorry\" while throwing his arms up in the air. Overall, everything was simply managed poorly. This was the most unacceptable part and this was the reason we will never be back."}
{"text":"Sour  warm milk, floaters in the tea, dirty silverware , and a waitress that rolled her eyes during ordering . Needless to say our order was canceled and we left , too scared to eat here."}
{"text":"Terrible service waited 45 minutes still not served Called mgr. on duty, and actually agreed with me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat, bkfast, lunch and dinner. staff super friendly, food always great. I have gotten to different Dennys locations but Dennys on Trop and Decatur always the BEST!!  Juan is a great employee, always smiling, always making sure our table is taken care of. Thank you to all the cooks! food always amazing."}
{"text":"Disgusting ! This place smells moldy and worn. We were seated in a booth that had ripped up holes in the seats. I'm allergic to mold, and started having trouble breathing . We left , and the staff (who were very nice and apologetic) asked if I could talk to the manager. Hmm. That tells me they hate it too.  Seriously this place needs to get renovated or torn down."}
{"text":"The worse Denny's I've been to very rude employees very filthy  never eat there again"}
{"text":"One of my regular spots. It's open 24 hours on almost every day of the year. Generally friendly staff and good service. Big American-style portions. Pretty standard prices for a sit-down restaurant. Denny's is not just a breakfast restaurant, it's got a big menu with a lot of tasty items. You get your food pretty quickly.   The wait is gargantuan on a weekend breakfast or lunch hour, so get a reservation. It's better to go later in the day. There usually will not be any wait at other times of the day.  If you're ever craving breakfast or a good ol' American fatty dinner, Denny's should be a top option."}
{"text":"Horrible costumer services, if you come to Vegas, do not eat  at this place. I waited almost an hour to get my food. The stars don't lie!"}
{"text":"Took forever to receive our food, and when we did it was all cold.. The staff decided to flirt with customers instead of serving them. The only thing that they didn't mess up was the water..."}
{"text":"I am a frequent Denny's patron. I used to come to this Denny's multiple times a week before they moved across the street. The food is still wonderful and I can still get my diner coffee fix. However, the new building more frequently than not smells like human feces. I'm surprised none of the other reviews reference it. On several occasions I have walked into the door and had to turn and leave for another Denny's location. The bathrooms are spotless, which makes me think the problem might be a gas leak... Whatever it may be, it has been a big disappointment. This used to be my favorite Denny's. ):"}
{"text":"My wife and myself love Denny's and go to it at least twice a week. When travelling, as now, e go more often. But unfortunately some Denny's franchise do some strange things. This one at las Vegas is one of thise and have a constraint on cream to the coffee, !!!!!!!, never heatd of it, that's why the low rate."}
{"text":"Tables and benches were dirty had to change to benches to a third clean one.... I was directed to a family table the second time... The third table was clean...  Thanks to the waitress named Amanda for such a long time I receive such poor customer service and several restaurants when I came to dinner tonight Amanda blew me away with your excellent customer service kudos to Miss Amanda way to go great job"}
{"text":"Bad feeling about foods and services. We came with 2 women, 3 men and 2 kids, the waiter fogot to bring the drink for us, the beef burn when they fried and used to make the salad."}
{"text":"Worst Dennys experience I've had. I'm usually a fan of the decently priced restaurant that has a menu of items that a person could easily make at home but are too lazy, too drunk, or traveling to make. I just placed an order to go and walked the short block down the strip to pick it up. Their credit card systems make tipping awkward cause they ask if you would like to tip instead of letting you discretely fill it out yourself. I declined to tip on the card because I was going to tip in cash. After that service tanked. I decided to not tip after this, got my food and walked past the group of employees who seemed to be chain smoking right outside of the door. Walked back to the shop I worked at and found out that only one out of three orders was right. I walked back to get it fixed but the second trip wasn't any better. There was still a gauntlet of Dennys name tag wearing chainsmokers to walk through to get inside. Nothing but negative attitudes awaited when I stepped in the door. I gave the food to the lady that just separated herself from the smoking excursion outside and let her know that we were missing items off the order and what we did get was lacking in accuracy of what our stomachs wanted. She grabbed the bag of mistakes and ran them into the kitchen, then power walked briskly passed me as though on a quest through middle earth. I later found out she was on an adventure to rejoin the ranks of tobacco enthusiasts outside, as there were people unnecessarily and patiently waiting to start their very own dining excursion, and to hand over somefuture hard earned dollars while attempting desperate this place themselves. I departed through the clouds of tobacco dependency and set myself going south towards my place of business. Got back to familiar surroundings and yet again found that the order wasn't what my digestive tract was craving. Then a feeling of regret hit me with a flashback of wanting to secure the accuracy of the goods that the whole adventure was based upon but instead decided to retreat. This narrative, though laced with colorful adjectives, is a work of nonfiction. But really the service was horrible and the food was under the low standard I usually hold Dennys to. I figured that the homeless that loiter infront of the business would create a problem for management but I hardly noticed them while weaving myself through the employee smoking area right outside of the main entrance. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone that consumes food or has anything to do in the day."}
{"text":"It's cheap in Las Vegas. Because all the things is expensive. And the food is not bad. The waitress is very kind to us. And every couple times she will comes and ask us for anything else."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was SLOW. And that is an understatement. 20+ mins for coffee that never came.  We came in as a family of four. We ordered the basic meals, nothing fancy, and nothing to change really.. and no one was really there at the time ( around 5 Pm back in February of this year).   Waitress did not update on the food, and took her time getting back to the table. Was not very friendly.  Very slow, spent more time talking with other customers or new customers rather than serving us our food that we ordered and waited over 45 mins for.    Might go again for the food, but the service was terrible. You shouldn't have to wait for a meal when the place is dead empty and not busy at all.  She was a medium-dark blond female, with middle length hair, thin girl, maybe around 25-30 years old.  Hopefully the other servers there have a better attitude and attentiveness to time and updating on the status of the food.   Only gave her a small tip due to this. I think it's unacceptable service."}
{"text":"Very clean.  The whole staff was very nice and accommodating.  We had a party of 21 and the waitress wasn't phased at all.  She gave us separate  checks, made sure everyone had what they wanted and gave us our check promptly.  She was a hard worker.  The cashier was also very nice and so was the other person who brought us our food.  Bathrooms were clean.  I'm giving a 4 star because the food was just ok.  We had the talapia and sirachi burger.   I should have taken pics. :("}
{"text":"First time in vegas! And dennys trip was amazing came with my cousins and he helped us really quick. Got us the drinks and food super fast and attentive  who would have thought on a New Year's Day we'd get fed so quick !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Thanks marco!"}
{"text":"The service is bad takes for ever to be seated and the waitress is constantly forgetting orders and having to wave here down. The Mexican guy that works there is really good at taking orders and getting are food out in great time and I will only go there if  he's there. This dude James that gave this place 5 stars might be in the wrong Denny's"}
{"text":"Honestly, if I could put 0 stars I WOULD.   This place sucks. The service was honestly awful. We waited about 15 minutes until our server FINALLY came to our table to take our order and then the food took about 30 minutes until we got it. This is honestly the slowest service I have EVER GOTTEN from a Denny's. And not to mention how HORRIBLE the food was even though it took them freaking forever to cook it!!! The portions were SO SMALL, smaller than other Denny's I've been to, AND my hash browns were BURNT. Who freaking burns hash brown?!?!   DONT COME HERE, you can honestly get better food and better service anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast with my family and after 15 minutes of waiting and no one saying anything to us. Walking by several times. We left. Service sucks here. Go to Country Club and southern instead."}
{"text":"Denny's is all about the customer. At least that is my experience. This location has the best manager and it is a soothing, homey atmosphere. This is my favourite place to eat and the portions don't disappoint. I was still full that evening from the breakfast alone! Plus their coffee rocks! They may not have the best staff but once you let them know what's not right, they will make it right for you. That is why I have nothing but positive comments about Denny's and in particular this location. I will continue to go here!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great servers!!! Food was delicious. Everything was just perfect. Waiter even made sure we had plenty of extra sides."}
{"text":"This is the best Denny's in the area. Friendly, fast, good food. Other Denny's pale in comparison to this location."}
{"text":"Mmmm.. I'm stuck in the middle with this rating  :). Man I come here every weekend and it's always ran ragged . The staff is not prepared and they are stretched thin . The staff goes back and forth on what to do to assist the waiting clientele. So you may be asking yourself why I keep coming back right ? It's the cooks and how the dishes come out delicious every time . So now I just people watch for those furious on their experience and chill while we wait for our table and food :) so again. The service needs fine tuning but the food is delicious . Other Denny's around the valley just don't compare with the cooks form here ."}
{"text":"We arrived for brunch on a Saturday with low expectations, but the service still managed to sink lower than expected.  A table seated after us managed to order, eat, pay and leave 10 minutes before we got our food.  After that, I found a hair in my food.  When we asked for more water, our server just brought us our checks instead.  Maybe it is better when it isn't busy....? I'll never go back to find out."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Denny's since I was a kid. Me being a cook and a big guy I gotta say I love the food and love the times I make here as a family come one come all let's go to Denny's and have a ball"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had. Didn't get our drink order right(we only had two drinks, water and lemonade. Guy have us a coke instead of lemonade). We order a grand slam, ultimate omelette and a short stack of buttermilk pancakes. We didn't even get the short stack of pancakes, our food wasn't even hot and the toast was soggy. The whole time we were there the waiter Juan S. Didn't even come refill our drinks or check if we need or wanted anything else. After we finished eating we waited for our bill and nothing. We had to walk up to the register and get it ourselves. The manager took our payment, didn't even ask how our experience was. As someone we worked in the customer service industry for 8+ years I expected better service. I understand being busy and stressful days but at least say hi my name is, or pause on the way to the next table and say need anything? Awful. I will not be returning to this establishment anytime soon."}
{"text":"Horrible experience !!!!!! Noooo exaggeration !!!!!! The service was pathetic and food was ok . My server came twice around and was rude , the first to get my order and drink and then to be obnoxious . I went alone and wasnt expecting my boyfriend to show up but he did so instead of the server asking if he wanted something to drink she said \" when did you get here ? \" That was RUDE!! And she still didnt bother to offer him a drink or something to eat . And to top it off she over- charged me for fries when i didnt even order fries to begin with . Im usually a GREAT tipper but this was such a bad experience i stiffed her . She didnt even deserve a penny . I will NEVER go to this location ever again ."}
{"text":"So before I leave this place my server Jesus was great  funny guy no complain about that my food was delicious the only thing that bothered me was the host she automatically sat my girlfriend and I all the way In the back?? When their was more than 7 tables available in the front. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Placed order online and when I got home did not receive the ham from lumberjack breakfast, called store and was told by female employee that I can get refunded but have to wait for manager to come in.  An hour goes by and no call, so I called up and spoke to Hector who is the manager on duty, he says he cant refund will need to wait for general manager, waited 2 more hours still no call.  Finally received call from Operator of this Denny's location named Alfredo, all he did was laugh and made a mockery of me for this situation, he says he will refund  so lets see what happens.  Worst experience ever from hostess all the way up to Operator of the store.  This store deserves no stars."}
{"text":"Ate here for an early morning breakfast (around 5:30am) and the food was okay, the coffee drinkable, and a friendly waitress made the walk from my downtown hotel worth it.  About half the price of a hotel breakfast, but my veggie omelet had yellow squash (blech) and zucchini (not a fan either for omelets) in it."}
{"text":"They only  have 2 waitresses and you have to wait at least 10 minutes to order, seated and cash out. The place is clear and close to the hospital but their service is so slow."}
{"text":"YUCK! Ate here on my honeymoon with my wife and the food service and cleanliness of the place was AWFUL. Our food was cold, the waitress didn't care, and was too busy socializing in the soda room to take care of anything. I noticed there was a table that was not bussed OUR ENTIRE visit. 45 minutes that slop stayed on the table. We had NO sugar for our (weak) coffee and nobody in sight to ask for some. Had to ask the table next to s for some. The host kid deliberately cut my wife off as she was speaking to him to talk to an off duty stripper or cocktail waitress type who was returning something and asking for her money back when we were going to GIVE them money. We will NEVER return. My wife still chose to leave a tip, but I wanted to leave a penny on the table."}
{"text":"Just walked out of dinner from Denny's with the worst experience ever. We arrived at 10:30pm and there were barely anyone in the restaurant and we had to wait AN HOUR AND A HALF more our food and we couldn't find our server the entire time. Complaining to the manager and server only got us responses like \"We apologize\" or \"Your food is on its way\" THE WORST SERVICE EVER.  On top of everything, when the food finally arrived, the supreme skillet and two other different skillet was served cold! Who serves a skillet cold? It's supposed to be sizzling hot!  Additionally, when our server (who finally showed up!) refills our coffee, she even had to ask, \"Is the coffee cold? If it is, I will grab a fresh pot\" WHICH SERVER ASKS A CUSTOMER IF HIS/HER COFFEE IS COLD?  Worst of all, when it came to remove our plates after we've finished our food, the server was extremely present and couldn't wait to push for the check.  To sum it up: I will NEVER step foot into this Denny's ever again."}
{"text":"Eating with my youngest breakfast :) just mommy & isaiah  !! Great service yummy food !! My son got a cupcake cup yo take home he is so happy :)"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and wanted quick lunch yesterday around 3 before our movie. We we sceptical bc location where we used to live wasn't good. HUGE difference. The restaurant itself was so clean and nice, staff were amazing. I started with a side of fruit, none was mushy, all was perfect. My superbird was the best I ever had it and my bf had the farmer sausage skillet, it was so good! I can't remember our servers name, but he was great, the timing was spot on and he was friendly, we were never needing to get his attention, he was so in point. Management was there and was wandering around, helping where ever. Overall fantastic experience. I'm so glad we found a good Denny's!"}
{"text":"We're staying at the Sandman hotel in which this Denny's is located. The hotel seems pretty nice, so we expected that the Denny's would be at least as good as a mediocre Denny's at some other place. Man, were we disappointed! The skillet I ordered filled about half the skillet, was missing a major ingredient and had virtually no meat on it. The eggs were all overcooked, the coffee tasted old, the waitress left us waiting long periods of time, and our tab (for two adult entrees and a kids meat) was about $50. This location managed to underwhelm despite my low expectations going in."}
{"text":"Came to Denny's for breakfast with my husband and it is pretty busy. We were seated right away but the server didn't come to greet us or get out drink order. It took her 20 minutes and by that time we were debating on whether to leave. So we order our food and drinks at the same time. About 30 minutes later our food comes out cold and flavorless.  I had the Santa fe skillet and my husband ordered the Berry pancakes. He said that his pancakes were okay but nothing special. My skillet, it had no flavor no matter how much salt, pepper, or tabasco. I had lost my appetite and my husband did too. We went to pay and had asked to speak to a manager. We had told her that we were not looking to cause problems or get free food, but we had explained to her the problems with this meal and she had told us that they were short staffed and many people had called out. Well my husband and I work in the resturant industry. Many people would be happy to work extra hours to earn more money. Just call them in..."}
{"text":"I ordered an avocado chicken salad.   The waiter brought it to the table without avocado.  He offered strawberries,  pecans,  cranberries,  or apples.   I said strawberries.   He came back and said there's no strawberries and gave me the apples,  cranberries,  and pecans.   They were not organized.   Before bringing the customer a plate,  they should let them know that they were out of any ingredient, allowing the customer to choose if they want something else.  They had me pay full price for an incomplete order.  I will not be going back to this Denny's."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Denny's. This particular Denny's....not so much. For one, it alwaysss smells so bad in there. Like a port-a-potty! The people who work here are usually very very nice. When is comes to breakfast, which is usually what I always get, the food is lousy, especially if you get take-out. Most of the time the redskin potatoes are over-done, the hash (shredded potato things) are gooey on the inside, you get very small, thin, flimsy pieces of bacon, and the eggs are always cold with a playdoe-like texture. And to make it worse (or better, considering the bad food) the portion size of the sides are extremely small. The only good portion of food you'll get is with pancakes. Just a few weeks ago I decided to try something new. I ordered the T-bone steak with eggs, shredded potatoes and bacon. I also ordered a separate meal which was the Zesty Nachos. The waitress was very nice. But I waited close to an hour (about 45 minutes) for my food when I was told it would only be 15mins. I even made a stop at the gas station next door while waiting. There was no \"sorry for the wait\" just a bunch of \"just a few more minutes\". When I finally got my food to take home, the food was TERRIBLE! The steak was SO tough and dry, I could barely cut it with a sharp knife. I am so serious. If were to drop it on the ground, it would sound like I dropped a rock. The potatoes were gooey as I said they always are and I had playdoe eggs once again. And if it were a guessing game for where the nachos came from, I would have guessed an \"Easy-Bake Oven\". You would think after waiting all that time they'd be making magic back in the kitchen, but I don't know what was going on. I'll just stick with pancakes from now on or not go there at all."}
{"text":"Awful. I enjoy a drunken trip to Denny's every few years. Microwaved bacon. Really? Server handed me a plate roughly the temperature of the surface of the sun. English muffin hit me in the face, then fell to the floor of a Vegas Denny's. He said nothing. Lol. Egg shells in my food....I didn't order eggs."}
{"text":"Exceptionally nice staff, great diner food, and the staff remembers you! I came here six months prior to this weeks visit. I noticed on all the name tags the staff retention is very good. They seem so relaxed and non stressed in that environment! Lots of smiles! See you in six weeks!"}
{"text":"I love this Denny's they are always treating me amazingly. Chad has made our dining experience well worth staying late in a work night . This is my favorite location to come to ."}
{"text":"Worst service ever and the manager was awful. Food was cold. Hash browns soggy with grease. Flimsy bacon when I asked for crispy. Everything was in the danger zone temp wise. And took FOREVER. Server was Janelle (had to figure that out by reading her name tag seeing as she didn't introduce herself.) Probably won't return."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here to this location and I've received the SAME crappy service from the SAME waitress. Her name is Leslie and if you can, avoid being in her section at all costs! She came and checked on my table ONCE in 45 minutes. My cup of coffee sat empty for 30 and only when I talked to the manager did I get any kind of service. Never coming back to this location. Would give 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, went with my family of 5, they sat us down, and about 15minutes passed by and there were no signs of the waiter even coming by to order our drinks, it wasn't even busy & we walked out and left."}
{"text":"Ordered appetizer sampler, got 2 small pieces of chicken and 3 mozzarella sticks for over $6. That's a rip off."}
{"text":"Good place! Our favorite waiter Tim is here being transferred from the former location at 2360 W. Northern. I love this Denny's and I come here a lot to get food and see Tim! It is a place I feel safe at in the North Mountain/North Phoenix/Moon Valley/Paradise Valley area."}
{"text":"dined several times, food always was just the average coffee shop meal. the last time I was there, I noticed something in my coffee, and upon further inspection, saw that it was a baby cockroach. DO NOT EAT HERE! if there's one, there's more! when I brought it to the waiters attention, he quickly picked up my cup and ever so quietly whisked it away and brought me a new fresh cup. needless to say, I exited before my meal even came."}
{"text":"I've lived near this Denny's for years now and every time I'd think about going in I'd convince myself it was another American chain with no soul and so never went in.  Finally one Saturday morning we were starving and didn't think McD's would cut it.  Off we went.    Surprisingly....it wasn't half bad!  Efficient service, huge portions, fluffy pancakes and crunchy hash browns, and even a balloon artist walking around to entertain little kids.  A bit pricy in the end (around $35.00 for two meals and two drinks) but I find breakfast ain't that cheap anyhow.     So my prejudice towards large American chains (esp. Ones that are open 24 hrs) has been quashed.  I will go back for another big and boisterous breakfast."}
{"text":"The waiter we had was extremely nice and my food was extremely good here I ordered the fish and chips with extra tartar sauce and it was delicious define toy coming back here again"}
{"text":"If you like Denny's, you'll like this one.  Albeit it is JUST off the freeway - but so are a LOT of them around the country (meaning there are times when the place is insanely full and the wait is far more than I am willing to wait for just about ANY restaurant) - and I have eaten at a LOT of them around the country.  But, I live a mile and a half away from this one.  Years back, this place had terrible customer service. Your waiting time to get your food, from the time you were seated, was anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour.  Not anymore.  I continued to go to this Denny's throughout the years just because I am absolutely in LOVE with their slam breakfasts!  I take friends/family to the place and sit at a booth, I go alone and sit at the \"bar\", either way, I find the service to be acceptable and the food?  Well, I just do the slam type of breakfast there, I really don't go there for anything else.  It's always a eat-til'-the-plate-is-clean experience for me.  ;"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided we should check out Denny's for breakfast. We walked over from the Luxor(a decent walk not too far). The place was packed, we had to wait for about 15 mintues before we got seated. The first thing I didn't like was that the hostess was walking way faster then us. I understand its busy and you are trying to move fast but com'on really you cant wait for your guests? He was walking so fast I had to watch where he went..Then we got seated and our waitress came right away and took our order for drinks. We both got water and he got coffee. My water cup looked very cloudy, like it wasn't cleaned well, like it was used for oj before my water, and his water cup looked perfectly clear. The food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I wish you didn't even have to leave a star. Waited 15 minutes and never even got seated, while there were plenty of open tables. The hostess said wait while I check the tables and never came back."}
{"text":"Took 15 min to take a to go order with only one person ahead of us. The gentleman was nice enough to allow my party to take our order and the cashier still didn't take our order. They had a complaint on waiting so long to pay there check and the cashier actually mentioned how he waited 45 min before,  when does an employee waiting become more important then a customer.  Ad we were waiting for our food two additional parties had complaints too!  Bad all the way around."}
{"text":"At 5:30am on Las Vegas Boulevard, Denny's is your friend  I usually do not have much love for Denny's these days, but after a long night of partying, this location on the Las Vegas Strip can be just the right place for the right price.   Do not go here sober: you will be the only one besides the staff and will not like it.   Hordes of sweaty tourists and drunken revelers slide through this place 24 hours per day all year long and it shows. It is the dirtiest Denny's you will ever sit in, and that's saying a lot.   But do not mind those minor details; remember, you are drunk and hungry, and Uncle Denny is here to help with that headache. Inside this diner you will experience the greatest craving for substandard food in your life. In a swirling and spinning haze with sounds that cut in and fade out, you will throw out your sensibilities and last vestiges of decency and want everything on the menu like an uncultured swine. Gazing at the menu with a childlike sense of awe and amazement--somewhere in your brain's basement a little voice will pose this question: does this place employ a hypnotist?--you start to feel that each perfectly posed piece of colorful food on the menu is beckoning you.   Give into those feelings my hard-partying friend; you've earned the right to sit at the booth of frat kings that has comforted hundreds of thousands of bacchanalian souls coming off 15-hour sprees of drinking, gambling, and dancing with Dionysus just like you. You are now in the sticky, vinyl throne of Vegas. You have arrived.   (For the best 24-hour eats in Vegas, head to Mr. Lucky's 24/7 in the Hard Rock Hotel; that diner cannot be beat during the in-between times)."}
{"text":"This place has always been clean when I come in. Everyone is nice, even the patrons, and the service is fast.  Good breakfast+Nice waitresses=Good start of day"}
{"text":"This must be a corporate training center. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. They have a huge staff, but only a few people know what they're doing. Was served something I didn't order, but i decided to eat it instead of waiting another twenty minutes. I must say they are very good at apologizing."}
{"text":"I'm tired of going into Dennys and they only have 1 server. I guess they figure more are not needed. Thing is there are 6 other parties besides myself and I see another coming in. All these places need to hand more staff. So don't have to wait a long time to get things. The server is doing her job it's management that fails to cheap to put another person on duty at the probably less than $10 an hour they pay servers. If you go in the morning it's ok but afternoon or evenings and it's lack of help."}
{"text":"Save your money for a different diner. My food was horrible. Fries were rock hard. So was the bread. My steak was raw inside I ordered well done."}
{"text":"I love Denny's and this location is my favorite to go. The staff is always so friendly and never pushy or bothersome. My husband and I love going here with our baby, its a very nice place."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant! I had a wonderful experience here! The staff was so friendly! This is how it should be when you go out to eat! They did everything right. The person I was with and I had really great food. The food was excellently prepared! We both ordered grand slammed breakfasts. We both got our breakfast orders prepared exactly how we had ordered them! The other customers were enjoying their food and conversation. And seemed to be having very positive experiences! I highly recommend this place. The main reason I would recommend it is because of the waitresses that were working the last time I was there. They were so nice. They were incredibly polite. They made me and my guest feel welcome in this business. The waitresses also did their job with incredible accuracy and skill. I really also appreciate the positivity that their attitudes brought to my day. It was refreshing to have my needs as a customer met, and to also have people act uplifting!  Thanks for the smiles! You all made my day!"}
{"text":"Long wait at 5:50 AM when no one else was waiting to be seated. Very slow. Staff os unapologetic and apathetic to diners. Quick cooks saved this trip. Servers are mediocre which is a generous statement. Christmas music was drowned out by blaring spanish music coming from prep area."}
{"text":"The food was awesome as usual. My wife and her two coworkers visited this Denny's in Whitby on Friday March 6.  The co-workers were new to Denny's and were very excited about the menu and wanted to try everything.  There enthusiasm and enjoyment was soon destroyed by their male waiter from the bowels of hell. He slammed down every plate and dish ordered, walked away and completely ignored us in mid sentence trying to add additional items to the order.  The food order was wrong but they were afraid to return the orders. This was the meanest waiter ever.  This waiter even yelled at them to leave the tip on the table instead of in his hand."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. First off, there was no hostess to seat us. I had to go find and ask a server , that should have been my first clue.  Once seated our order was taken quickly but that's where it ends. There were only a  handful of people inside and it took 45 minutes to get coffee and dessert. Our server never came back until we were almost ready to leave with coffee refills and water.  Do not go here unless you have unlimited time on your hands.  PS a positive note the dessert was good"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Denny's, good food at reasonable prices. This one did have issues though. Like others that have yelped it is under staffed but the biggest issue that I've seen is they have a pest problem. The first time I went with my wife and we saw little black bugs crawling out of the creamer. At first we thought this was one time occurrence and they took care of the issue (For health inspection reasons) but no, we went again 2 months later and this time more little bugs were crawling from the plates. We showed the waitress the bugs and the manager eventually only compensated the one plate (Could of done a better job, come on... these are bugs crawling in your food, a definite health violation).  Also who knows the bugs could have been in all of the food. The waitress seemed like this was a normal occurrence which makes me wonder how bad it really is. Half of the bugs from the plate escaped into the booths. So next time you go to this Denny's keep an eye out for little bugs in your food. The bugs were the size of a nail head. I will not return to this Dennys."}
{"text":"I work at the Cannery and have an ever changing schedule.  I've give this Denny's a chance over and over again.  It has never been great but recently I had the worst experience of my life.  I was in last Thursday and had a server named Cameron.  He seemed completely uninterested in helping us.  He told us that he was off soon and just seemed to be counting down the minutes.  He seemed to be ignoring our table even though I never say him running around waiting on other tables.  I felt like we were rushed to eat our meal and after having just worked all day, we were not interested in being rushed.  In this review, I want to give another review, which is the only reason I have even bothered to give one.    Tonight my fiance came over after I got offer work and she wanted to go to Denny's after I got off.  I tried to get her to go elsewhere but she really wanted Denny's.  We went in and I have to say, this was the best experience I've had.  I was bummed because I wanted a scoop of chocolate ice cream and they were out of it, but I was pleasantly surprised by our service (which has previously been my issue).  Tonight Bart waited on us.  He was so refreshing after the last experience I had here.  He was interested in providing us with a positive dining experience, and nothing else.  I watched him with other tables and he seemed to treat every table with the same amount of courtessy and respect that he treated us.  I really have no desire to ever go back to this location at any other time rather than when Bart is working.  Sadly, I don't attend Denny's all that often after 10PM which seems to be when he is working."}
{"text":"When we arrived, it took 25 mins for the server, Linda, to take our drink orders. It took her 10 mins after us sitting down to acknowledge us by giving us a simple \"I'll be right with you,\" however she continued to carry out the order of the table besides us until they had their food and required no further attention temporarily. There were a total of 3 parties on my side of the restaurant, ruling out the possibility that she was \"too busy\" to ask for our drinks. The drink order was incorrect and one of the cups had a piece of dry food attached.  We began eating 40 minutes after entering the restaurant. The food was good and tasted like always. I understand this Denny's location is in the more run-down part of Vegas, however that is no excuse for this establishment to reinforce this reputation further. I still enjoy the food at Denny's, and if you do as well, I would recommend driving the extra couple miles to avoid the less than satisfactory performance of the staff."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. I order a Grand Slamwich but when they brought me the food... the plate was filthy dirty (had avocado stain, coffee stain, etc)... I wish I would of taken a picture but I told to waitress about it.  Before I did that I cut off a piece of the bread to insure they don't bring me the same sandwich since the plate was very dirty.  5 min later they bring back the sandwich in a clean plate but it was the same sandwich, they just put it in the microwave. I told them and they apologized but I couldn't believe they did that, so I didn't order anything.  Won't come back here again!"}
{"text":"Last 3 times I've been here food has been bad , last time got order wrong and I tried to eat the ham tasted like metal the eggs no flavor coffee was bad and never brought new coffee never again"}
{"text":"I've dined here over a dozen times since moving to the east valley.  The establishment is on the way home from work and therefore convenient for me.  The service has been highly erratic-ranging from mediocre to absolutely horrid.  Tonight the iced tea tasted like coffee, the club sandwich was missing items, and the server was nearly nonexistent.  I will not be returning to this Denny's location ever again."}
{"text":"Gabriel D. Was one of the best servers we've ever had. Funny, accommodating, and professional. We were blown away at his level of service.   We will be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Service: Very friendly staff! Bonnie is an excellent waitress.  Cleanliness: Great. Clean restrooms and well-kept diner.  Food: Typical Denny's - hit the spot."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday morning at 10:50 AM.  The girl in the front said she was going to clean a table and seat us. This was said in front of her co-worker, who reassured us that our table would be ready in a few minutes.  About a minute later he decides to try and seat us at the bar, even though our table is ready. We explain that we would rather sit at the table instead.  Our waitress was pleasant and took our order at 10:55 AM.  Drinks were brought out quickly, but there was no silverware or napkins on the table. At 11:15 AM our waitress comes to the table to inform us that the computer \"lost\" our order and she needed to write it down again. She was very apologetic. At 11:25 AM she came back again and said the food would be out shortly, there were a few orders ahead of ours. At 11:30 AM I called the Manager over to explain that we had been now waiting 35 minutes for 2 omelettes and still had not received the food and at this point was ready to pay for our beverages and leave. He apologized and said the food would be right out. Fast forward another 5 minutes and we were finally served, but had to point out that we still had no silverware.  Again, the waitress was very apologetic and took the beverages (1 orange juice and 1 lemonade) off of the bill. The food was good (what you expect from Denny's),  but was not worth waiting 40 minutes for."}
{"text":"Christmas night, we came here to get a club sandwich, a milk shake, a peacun pie and a hot fudge lava with a scoop of ice cream.. We walked in there was no one to greet us. Someone finally came and told us to give her a minute. We waited....looked thru the Togo menu. We waited and waited more. Finally, someone came check out a customer who was ready to check out. The male employee leaves and tells us someone quill be there to take our order...we wait more. From the looks of the restaurant they had 3 talked on the side and a large group....we wait. Finally, a lady takes our order she tells us it will be 15 mins...I replied 15 more then we've already waited? She said yes, I said we have a party of 15...not like (I should care) but there needed to be some mangers on the scene to get us in and out. Our order was simple. I told her we were going across the street to pump gas and i hope our ordee would be ready when we came back we. I tried to be understanding but whats up with the service??? We arrived approx at 10:05pm and did not leave with our simple to go club sandwich and desserts until 10:55pm. I hope things change for this location and their future customers."}
{"text":"Went there today for brunch and was disappointed to say the least. I had the lumberjack slam and my wife the American slam and was not even close to the quality I remember having compared to other dennys in the past. My over easy eggs were okay but the pancakes were not very good at all. I don't know what they did the breakfast sausages but I had one bite and that was it. They were soggy and tasteless. Perhaps they nuked them before serving? The worst part was how much they charge for a cup of coffee. $2.89 ea. We both had coffee so that's almost $6 just for coffee! Half the price of my meal. The coffee was good but c'mon this isn't some cafe with a 3 thousand dollar machine pumping out the brew. The hash browns took up half the plate and no amount of salt or ketchup was going to save those poor potatoes.  $33 and change later we left with no intention on coming back. There are plenty of mom and pop restaurants in town that do it way better for less so my business will be going there."}
{"text":"Went to this location this past week, and was horrified by the experience!  There was 1 waitress and a relatively full house. 4 meals took nearly an hour to come, and they werent even correct! Then, my 5 year old son started screaming and crying after he was bit or stung by something in the booth. We got up to leave, and I asked to speak to a manager. When I showed her the bites and told her it just happened,  she just shrugged us off! Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Before they remodeled, they were so fast with their service and the food was right on par with Denny's quality. I am a fan of Denny's, so for me to write a negative review about this place, they deserve it.   I took my family here because I want to show them how awesome I thought they would be considering that this is the busiest Denny's in the world. It took 45 minutes for the food to come out, food was cold, and server too busy trying to make excuses for slow speed.   Servers: please note that most customers do not want to hear excuses. Most times, the best response from you is \"I'm sorry.\""}
{"text":"This Denny's was okay. However, what ruined it for me was that they were so understaffed that I only received one refill for my entire visit. For perspective, I was there for about 2 hours. In addition, the server's attitude was that the onus was on us to accomodate them for being understaffed."}
{"text":"Great hot chocolate an free refills but the wifi sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Asked for no onions there were onions in my omelette asked for hash browns and they had mushrooms in them, not to mention they were extremely hard and inedible. Also my glass of water ended up having a ring of chocolate syrup at the bottom!"}
{"text":"Really bad service! nobody was in the place a lot of chairs empty. three waitresses and all the waiters looked at me but nobody said  I'll be right with you, not even a hello. really bad service do not go to this Denny's!"}
{"text":"My staple dinner place, always end up here after work and the service is always consistent and with a smile. Items tried: sample platter - jalapeno bottle caps (love) chicken strips, quesada (really cheesy but once its cold doesn't taste good), onion rings. Pancakes, waffles, veg skillet, the sausage skillet, fish n chips, salmon (bf told me its got no flavour) hashbrown, stake, nachos and of course amazing fries. Love the ambience, they are so attentive and cheerful at tht wee hour, huge portions and its 24hours. I am a fan.  ===============================PRIYA======"}
{"text":"Wow this Denny's needs a pest control company we went here for dinner and was seated at a booth my husband seen a bug on the table and said that looks like a cockroach and we call over the server and she got the lady in charge well she just said to us oh sorry we just sprayed oh thanks for letting us know there more where they came from I don't think spray will help this place they need more then that wow and walked away like nothing  I will never eat at this Denny's again REPORT this place to corporate office sad to think people don't know this!! People this is a place where we EAT FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"My wife asked me not go back there anymore. Although this is the worst Denny's in town, I could eat a burger there, but my wife's dinner was burned and horrible. This place needs an audit by the franchiser. Also, management is quite cheap. Does not deserve to be called Denny's."}
{"text":"Meh. You're better off ordering to go so you don't have to sit there with the awful waitresses. Food is average. Most of them just stand around and talk."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Usually overpriced.  Breakfast is good.  Meals are less than desired. Open 24 hours not common in Toronto.  American model.  Not at favourite place to walk into. Prefer local or Canadian based franchise attune to local"}
{"text":"Had to leave after waiting in the doorway for about 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging me. Had to let the tall guy behind the counter know that I was waiting to be helped as he pretended to be studying a receipt.  This was my first time in many years that I have been to a Denny's and will definitely my last to this specific location on Mcknight rd.  *Just a quick note; a simple, \"I'll be right with you\" would have sufficed and I would have given you my business.*"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here.Pancakes are a bit dry. Salads are good. The music is old school which is great.waitress is nice . I mentioned the dry pancakes  to her she said she would inform the cook."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service. Our waiter was not only rude, but only checked on us 2 times during our visit. The girl who brought our food to the table seemed inconvenienced by the fact that I asked for a refill on my drink. Now the manager, she was the worst part. Completely rude and out of line. She comes to the table to tell us that they are out of gluten free english muffins, which I had ordered. Then she seemed put out by the fact that I was upset over this. It's simple, keep an eye on what's low in stock at your restaurant and order when it is low! Would give this zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"The avocado chicken was what I had ordered here late night. The good thing about the place is the quick service. The bad thing is that the salad had too much dressing that it was drowning in it. I guess that can be a subjective opinion but I guess it ruined it for me. The chicken and avocado where fresh though and tasted great however the salad is usually essential for me and hence the rating."}
{"text":"Mediocre food but that's kind of what you expect from a Denny's. service started out ok but rapidly became nonexistent. I've been sitting here now for over 15 minutes with my empty glass and empty plate. While I watch the server wonder around oblivious to the fact I would like a refill and the check. I would have ordered desert but it don't want to spend the night here. If you are in any type of a hurry I would steer clear of this place. I normally tip 30%, not tonight though.  Still sitting here. Still being ignored. Server is nowhere insight."}
{"text":"Good food but a tad bit pricey for the regular breakfast fair.  Love how they have 2 choices of coffee now.  Both are good."}
{"text":"I like this Denny's in particular for one reason, the people. I love the server who usually works at night, I believe his name is Jesus. He's so genuine and sweet and went above and beyond for me and my son when we were with a large party. My boy was feeling very temperamental that night and Jesus understood so well. He not only brought him a bowl of goldfish right away but also 2 random little toys to keep him occupied. Denny's food is super average for the most part but I enjoy going here for a late night casual dinner out and feel really welcome thanks to people like Jesus."}
{"text":"Bad service, food took 50 minutes to arrive, when it did the fries were cold the sandwich looked like it had been heated in microwave. Had to ask for water, ask for sugar, ask for cutlery. The worst Denny's I've ever been too."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this Denny's in North Olmsted.  The waitress, Amy W., remembered me from my previous visit.  She was very positive and seemed to enjoy helping all the guests. On both visits, she made me feel comfortable and important.    The food was very tasty and came out within 10 minutes after ordering.  I ordered a new menu item: the Salted Caramel pancakes meal with Bananas, Banana Cream, and pecans infused inside the pancakes.  It came with eggs, sausage or bacon, and hash browns or red skin potatoes.  I ordered water as my beverage.  I asked for my pancakes to come out first, then my eggs, bacon, and hash browns in a to go box to eat at home later.  This happened seamlessly and didn't need to remind anyone.  Amy came over to ask how the food was after I ate a few bites, unlike many other restaurants I've been to where they'll ask you how the food is when you've clearly not yet eaten a bite or even unwrapped your silverware.  (Face palm!)  I didn't order coffee or soda, so she wasn't overbearing in topping off my drink.  She filled it back up once, in which I drank 3/4 of it before she automatically filled it back up.   The main restaurant was clean.  There more than enough people working for the 20 or so other guests.  The bathroom was clean, didn't smell bad, and there was soap to wash your hands.    I would eat there again 100%  Stop in for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a 3 a.m. face stuffing and I'm sure you won't be disappointed!    P.S.  I encountered Amy W. both times during the week in the mid-morning."}
{"text":"This is the nicest Denny's that we have ever eaten at. Not only is the restaurant clean and updated, the food was excellent! The wait staff was so friendly and the food cooked perfectly. If you like Denny's at all, this is the place to stop in Charlotte. I'd eat here every time we come through!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally give Denny's such high marks but this Denns is special. The wait staff can not be beat! They have many regulars and they remember our names and what we like to eat. The cooks make delicious diner food. It's always hot and flavorful. I can't say that about most Denny's. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"After a really good late breakfast a couple weeks ago, we decided to go back to this location for a late lunch. Only two other tables occupied at 1:30 pm. Seated promptly, drink orders taken, we ordered. Waited. Waited. 20+ minutes later, server returned to say \"The cook just told me there is no pot roast because it's still frozen solid!\" I told her both she and we should have known that before now. I ordered something else and my partner's chicken Caesar salad arrived. The plate had not been wiped. The lettuce was wilted with dressing the the chicken was stone cold. It went back. My omelette arrive and was hot and tasty but very greasy. Replacement salad was better but ordinary. Manager came over to apologize. I told her that the cook needed some supervision. Why did no one know that there was no pot roast? Why had he not started it that AM to be ready (it is a regular menu item)? Where was the manager when all this was NOT happening in the kitchen? And why did she not make it happen the way it should have been? They discounted the meals 25% (good) but we won't be going back anytime soon. IHOP or Grand Cafe at Sunset will get our business."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times had to wait forever for our food even though the place was dead. Food is good if you have the time to wait."}
{"text":"This morning my uncle and I were sit in the Denny's restaurant for breakfast and the server is ignoring us and serving others which are came in behind us.  I complain to the manger I didn't get any service  the ask us to leave or wait"}
{"text":"Not good! Waited longer than should have for everything...waitress, drinks...omg...for our food & they weren't even busy.  I'd say they were having a bad day, but it's that way every time I try to give them another chance."}
{"text":"The food was good, but one single server just messed it all up. With big signs of discrimination and giving us cold food. Luckily the manager and another server got us hot and good food. But they server made this place bad."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Denny's. The food is usually well prepared and the place is very clean from what I can tell. If you want a quick good cheap breakfast this is a great spot."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch but after seeing how dirty the entire restaurant was I left. Carpet was so dirty you could not tell what color it was, bathroom smelled of urine and everything was dirty. If the front is this bad it made me wonder what was the kitchen like"}
{"text":"I don't want to even give this place one friggin star. Came here this morning at 4 after a night of drinking. Worst place ever. This place was dead, yet they wouldnt let our group of 5 pick where we wanted to sit. A black dude with dreads was our waitor - most unprofessional service I've had in a very long time. He was rude and unattentive. Would have rather talked to the coworkers than do his job. Had to beg for our drinks and him to take our food order. I'm not expecting the \"cream of the crop\" to be working those hours, but he was ridiculous. Our food sat in the window before he brought the cold slop over. Usually I would have sent it back and gone elsewhere, but Waffle House was packed. An even more unprofessional \"manager' came over to see how everything was. Didn't catch her name but she was a thin white brunette with glasses. Told her how crappy the service was. She didn't apologize - just said they were busy - which.... They werent! There were MAYBE 5 tables full of customers. This is a sorry excuse for a business. Waste of calories and money. DON'T EAT HERE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Open seats but did not seat us. 4am we were very hungry but kitchen was very backed up even though they should have been prepared for this late night rush every weekend. Food was mediocre. Will not come back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were short on time and had only 40 mins to order and eat.  We were seated with orders done and food on our table within 15 mins.  We had a wonderful experience with our waitress and the whole experience was smooth.  Kudos and the food was yummy!   Thank you!"}
{"text":"On a day off from work I went to this location of Denny's for breakfast with my Husband.  It is located near a bunch of hotels, it is definitely convenient for anyone staying near by.    Even at 10 am on a Wednesday it was a pretty busy place, always a good sign.  We were greeted quickly and didn't have to wait for a table.  The benches at our table were quite dirty, so we swept them off with out napkins.  Our server Micheal came, greeted us and took our drink order.  The menu has changed, they now have a breakfast that you can choose 4 items from 10 or so choices for $8.99 and you can even add on extras for a couple dollars.  Even though that was very tempting, I decided to go for the heartland scramble, which you also get bacon, sausage, pancakes and hashbrowns with.  All for $10!  Micheal returned with my hot chocolate and took our food order.  My favorite thing about this place is that you get free refills on hot chocolate!  So I took full advantage.  Micheal popped by once to refill our drinks, while we waited for our food.  Our orders were out quite quickly, my food wasn't all that hot though.  Nonetheless it was a lot of food and it was all really good!  I got another refill on my hot chocolate while I tired to stuff all the food into my mouth.  When we were finished our dishes were cleared promptly.  Micheal brought us our bill but told us there was no hurry.  When we were ready he brought the debit machine to our table, chatting with us while we paid.  Our huge breakfasts and my numerous hot chocolates only cost $26 for the 2 of us!  Overall I was very happy with the service at this Denny's!  The food was delicious!  I will definitely return to this restaurant for my breakfast cravings!"}
{"text":"We sat at the counter for about 20 minutes before WE had to flag the manager down just for him to give us our drinks.  Another 3 minutes to finally meet our waitress and she didn't even give us our food!!  The food was OK pancakes a little under cooked.  Almost made us not like Denny's!  Avoid this one go to Ihop!"}
{"text":"Literal trash. Just stay away. Employees just dont seem to care. Save your money and go somewhere else where the service isnt complete dog shit."}
{"text":"Meh!  While in town for a Fantasy Football tournament, I decided to have breakfast at this spot b/c it was close to my hotel.  This is a new establishment, so I figured to give it a try.  I had a deluxe breakfast meal which included scrambled eggs, bacon and pancakes on the side.  Meal was subpar. I ended up throwing the blueberry pancakes away. It tasted like frozen supermarket pancakes. Eggs n grits were ok, not great---Coffee subpar.    My advice on anyone having breakfast---If you're in the mood for breakfast, skip this spot and walk further down the strip to the other Denny's. The other Denny's is more packed, but I've had  better meals there and its a cool people watch spot."}
{"text":"It's good to know that it wasn't an alcohol-induced delirium and that this aforementioned waitress really existed.  The food is a 2 or 3, as with most Denny's, but it's a 4 if she's waiting your table."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and food exceeded expectations.   They seem to keep an close eye for quality even in details: we ordered T-bone steak and the medium-rare steak was cooked just right; grapes in the sides for the Cali club sandwich were firm and the cherry tomatoes in the Kobb salad were ripened to the perfect sweetness.   Loved it, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was really good and our waiter was very nice. I had nachos and Belgium waffles. The bathrooms were nice and the place didn't smell as if bread was burned like the other Denny's I went to."}
{"text":"honestly if I could give this place a zero I would. We walk in and have about 6 different people see us waiting and we stood there a good 5 mins and to make matters worse they were about to help a couple that came in after us. We finally get seated and wait for about 10 mins before anyone comes to our table to ask us for drinks or anything but I had noticed that the couple that came in after us had already been served and visited twice by the waitress. I timed on my phone how long it would take the waitress or anyone to come back, took another 8 mins. My advice, avoid this place period. If you have to drive the distance to go to another Denny's, do it trust me you'll get way better service at a McDonald's."}
{"text":"Review is borderline 3.5 stars.   Came here around 3:30am on a Saturday morning after partying the night before. Decided to grab a quick bite before heading back to our hotel to sleep. I've only been to one other Denny's which was in the US and I didn't understand the hype. So when the Toronto location opened, I never visited. However, thank goodness for 24/7 restaurants and midnight munchies!   I do recall our waitress being super friendly and the food was alright. I don't know how I came to ordering the hearty hot skillet breakfast/dish ($11.49) of some sort with hash browns, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, eggs and a sausage.. but I did! The whole dish was a tad too greasy but very hot and comforting despite the sausage being too salty as well.   I came here with 4 others and I remember them telling me their food tasted good but I guess I'll have to update this review in a clearer state of mind, lol. Overall, it was a good experience for a 24/7 restaurant. Quick, friendly and not too busy.   PS- I apologize for only having a snapchat pic to post of my food! And I believe that's a Philly cheese steak omelette and hash browns across from me :)"}
{"text":"Dudes and Dudesses,  I know you're going to find this unbelievable, but Denny's new burgers are *killer*.  Yes,  Denny's, kids.  Seriously, these are $15.00 - $18.00 burgers anywhere else in the Valley, for $10.00 to $12.00.  And they are *good*.  I mean really *good*.   Geezers, think your teens.  Bobs, or Johnnie's, or wherever.  With great fries and a shake.   And, they're open all night.  So don't waste your nickels and dimes on the Number 8 at Taco Bell after getting trashed.  Go here.  You won't regret it.   On the downside, no beer, or wine, to go with those stellar burgers, but they have partnered with Uber so you can order online and have it delivered.  For an extra fee, of course.  Still, that's better than getting busted for drunk driving."}
{"text":"We went to have a late dinner at Denny's and the restaurant was packed. Maybe there was some sort of event nearby going on because it seemed like everybody decided to go there and dine in. I mean, there was a party of 5, and then a party of 12 ahead of us, and after us, another big party of 15ish? Even though they only had 3 servers on the floor, manager on duty, Jorge Arellano,  was quick to seat everybody around. It did took a little more time for the big parties to be seated, but that was understandable.  Our server, Brandon S., was very friendly, and did an awesome job bringing our food and keep tabs on our table. He never seem to panic in spite of big parties still coming in to dine. He always kept his cool and smile. And you could tell he was happy to serve us, not like other waiters that only do it to get a nice tip. He was very friendly and helpful. He is the kind of server that places the pancake order ahead of you so that you get them warm in perfect time as you finish your last bite.  Overall, great service! Great team and great leadership. You can tell the manager is a great person, and he's got an awesome team as well."}
{"text":"always great service. ron and suzzane are great. the food and coffee is always nice and hot."}
{"text":"Waited at the door 10 minutes with a others waiting to acknowledged. The mgr. looked directly at me twice.  Sat at the counter thinking to get more attention. Took 5 minutes for waitress. Ordered banana pecan pancake breakfast and ice tea. Was not busy maybe 10 tables in the whole restaurant and at least 5 servers. Food fortunately was excellent so worth the wait."}
{"text":"I came here a few times and the service was extremely poor, takes 15 mins to come take my drink order, then an extra 8 mins to receive that drink, than no show for about 30 mins and finally I would put my food order and now I wait another 40 mins to even receive the food. Then due to my work schedule changing from nights to days I started going graveyard & it's was phenomenal. Jesse 'Jesus' is incredible. He's fast, he knows exactly what he was doing, if I don't know he was a waiter I might have thought he was the manager. He's really personal he was just someone you can talk to after a long stressful day of work, which I enjoy. But recently I found out he was let go... in this case I'm not quite sure I'll be returning.. Jesse was amazing, and Denny's lost an incredible hard worker!"}
{"text":"We have always came to this dennys, but this morning was not great. My breakfast was thrown together and cold. The waitress acted if she didnt care about our concerns. Service was not great !!!"}
{"text":"Definite not consistent it's either hit or miss would like to give them 5 stars but I truly believe that they didn't earn it the food can be okay great place to eat if you just want something better than fast food"}
{"text":"Just like the other location the only consistency they have is that they are not consistent not the best place to eat breakfast with your family but definitely the cheaper one so if you're looking for that quick breakfast fast food style meal go to Dennys"}
{"text":"We ordered using the app to pick up rather than done in. The food was about 10 minutes behind what I was quoted, but that didn't bother me all so much. When I got the food to my car I did a quick once over and found a lot of items missing. I thought they may have forgotten an bag but they just didn't make a large portion of the order. I went in and they made the food I was missing (or so I thought). Once I got home I found I was still missing part of my order (I trusted that they fixed their error and didn't check before I left for good) and our food was cold from having to wait for them to make the missing items. I do not recommend this place. I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Went in with my fiance and our two kids. Our server was friendly but as more people came in you could tell it was stressing her out. Looked like there was only 2 servers 1 manager and 1 busser. They were noticeably understaffed. Anyway, I asked for a breakfast skillet with eggs over hard, but got my eggs over easy. Skillet was hot so I didnt make a big deal about the eggs because they finished cooking on the skillet. The food was decent. After we got our food I wanted hot sauce, but our sever was no where to be found. I waited for about 20 minutes with my food un touched before my fiance finally got up and asked a different server for hot sauce because they didn't have any on any tables nearby. Server never came by to ask if we were good on drinks or anything. We had to wait, until she came by with the hot sauce before we could ask for water. I don't think I'll be returning to this location, but if I do hopefully it's a better experience."}
{"text":"The reason they get 3 is because they have a really delicious bourbon burger that I simply love too much to order anything else , but every thing else is basic and nothing special to be honest , its still a good place to go just nothing amazing if you know what I mean , but this place does not deserve more than three stars just because of one burger."}
{"text":"I ate one breakfast and one lunch at this Denny's the week of Feb 5. The service was outstanding each time. The waitresses are sure working hard for the customers. The food was consistently good the way it is at most Denny's. Considering how crowded the place was both times I came, the food actually arrived pretty quickly. With a ton of overpriced food options on The Strip, sometimes it is nice to just sit back with a relatively inexpensive familiar option like Denny's."}
{"text":"When my husband and I walked in we saw there were lots of people eating.  We decided to eat at the counter.  Our waitress Liz was very cheerful and took our order right away. The food cooking smelled so good. Our order came within 10 minutes.  Our food was delicious.  We were watching the coojs and waitresses and they were working as a tem should be.  The manager Nick was there helping out also. We were there around 12pm during the lunch shift. Our experience was good and we highly recommend this Dennys on Losee Rd."}
{"text":"It's a great place we were seated quick our waiter was so amazing she was so kind always asking if we needed anything joked with us it was a great place to be family friendly food is great I've been to a few Dennys and they were awful with service and foods but this was just amazing Thank You Dennys !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Drunk food!  Tired from dancing and starving? Dennys it is!  After a a night out a bit drunk the best place to go is Denny's in my opinion.  Moons over my hammy always sounds good when your drunk. Enough said!"}
{"text":"It¬¥s good when it¬¥s not too crowded. It¬¥s located next to my hotel in Vegas, and I went to Denny¬¥s for their cheap and relatively good sizzlers, as a breakfast alternative, for a couple of days. The service changed on a daily rotation, and they all were really friendly.  One day I came around noon, and when it filled up shortly afterwards, a queue was forming at the entrance. One of the female employees started to continuously yell names of guests that were to be seated. That sound was quite disturbing. I believe that there could be a more peaceful way to process the queue."}
{"text":"Denny's is my favorite restaurant but today I was completely disappointed. The wait to be seated wasn't bad. They said 15 to 20 minutes. We got seated and it took a while to get our drinks. That was okay we understood it was busy. I ordered an omelette and the food came out pretty fast. But as soon as I saw it I felt so disgusted. The hash browns looked darker than my under eye circles and drier than my elbows. The eggs were a throw up yellow that looked plastic and I opened the omelette up to see how it looked inside and I don't even know how to describe what I saw. We were in a rush and I was hungry so I ate it. Next time I'll just stick to my usual Denny's. This location was just disappointing."}
{"text":"It's 2:30 in the morning. I've had some (A LOT OF) drinks. It's Denny's, you're not expecting much except for some quick, cheap, diner food. Literally blown away by what I saw here tonight. I put in a to-go order and needed to use the restroom before my \"go.\" A gentleman named Bruno (I think) guided my way safely to the restroom. Upon my exit I (gracefully) stumbled towards the hostess counter where I was notified my food would be ready shortly. Not even 5 minutes later I was on my way with a packaged up Moons over My Hammy and an Oreo shake. Currently \"Winning\" in my Uber ride home."}
{"text":"I'm happy to hear that some folks out there have good things to say about this Denny's but I don't! I live close by and Denny's usually has great breakfast, it's safe and you know what your getting however; this location breaks the norm. I've given it the benefit of the doubt so many times, but no more.       Slow Service     Cold food     Incorrect orders     If you like hot tea....good luck getting more hot water     The staff doesn't check on you after receiving your meal     No WiFi service     Dirty silverware  I dislike this Denny's so much that I actually logged in to write about it. The last time I did this was years ago. THEY SUCK.  A discriminating foodie.   Groovygirlaz"}
{"text":"Kae, our waitress was exceptional!.  food was very good, hot, served promptly. place was very clean even restrooms fresh and clean.  a great experience."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with family at 9:30pm...was seated at the booth, waited  for 20 mins and no one even bothered to come by to take our orders, so we walked out.  On the way out we ran into the manager and he didn't even care...they weren't even busy...even the one star rating for this place is too much in my opinion."}
{"text":"Very nice people but the food was awful as But the pancakes were alright and they make to die for hot chocolate oh but maybe keep the restaurant cleaner"}
{"text":"Worst ever Denny's encountered, period. Worst servers attitude, period. I suggest the owner step foot in disguised and witness first hand the WORST service and attitude ....of all the workers employed."}
{"text":"Cozy place. Really has that old school diner vibe. We came on a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy.   I got the Slamburger (12.59) which was okay. The patty wasn't too great. My friend said her Chicken Bacon Classic (14.79) was really good. The Velvet Pancake Puppies (6 for 2.99) were alright but were very doughy.  The Peanut Butter Cup Pancake Breakfast (10.79) was awesome. The buttermilk pancakes were very soft.  My friend loved the hash browns that came with it.  Service was great. Our waitress was super nice."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time abs I always order the chicken strip dinner with season fries. And it used to always be perfect. The last few times I've gone, the chicken has been severely over cooked, to the point where it was so crunchy hard and uneatable, that I had to ask our waiter to send it back, which I hate doing. I feel like I keep coming back here hoping they will improve, but so far... They haven't. I probably won't come back here for a while.."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I always thought that Denny's would be a sketchy diner joint, but this is actually nice! Me and my friends went there at about 12:30 am, we were seated quickly. The wait staff were so kind and our food did not take long at all! I recommend this location! I had an Oreo shake (which was amazing) and the Salted Caramel Banana pancakes with hashbrowns, sausage and scrambled eggs, so good!!!"}
{"text":"This Denny's is collocated with a Tahiti Village timeshare. The food is always fresh and the service is good. The Grand Slam breakfast is my favorite and I'm delighted it's available 24 hours / day."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Clean tables. Clean restrooms. Nice atmosphere. Great location. Good food. I brought my friends here and we hung out and had some good food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Awful service, poor attitude, poor food quality. 75 people in lobby waiting while wait staff stand around. 1 plate of food for our party comes out while others wait. Cashier checks our card out before we can give tip.  Waitress scowls because my son does not reach out to take plate from her.    Why did I pay 48.00 for this abuse?  Awful in every way.  Do not go here.   I gave 1 star only because the software requires it.  Denny's owes me money and an apology."}
{"text":"I like the food at Denny's more than meals served at pricier restaurants. My favorite is the Bourbon Chicken Skillet. Even though it isn't advertised as being gluten-free, it doesn't have any ingredients containing wheat- just chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in a yummy Jack Daniels sauce. Both Eat n Park and Max and Erma's have gone downhill in the past few years, but the food at Denny's has gotten better."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sloooooowwwww service people by us were Gave the wrong check. Another family waited over 15 mins for a box. You can hear the waiters complaining about other coworkers in the prep area. Waitresses barely checks on her tables"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  3 of us and there was a 45 minute wait for the first meal to come out.  Over an hour for the 3rd one with the other one somewhere in between.  I had ordered the chicken and sausage quesadilla.  When the 2nd meal came out they said they were out of chicken so we're were going to substitute the \"other\" chicken was that ok?  Since I had no idea what the original  chicken was I said ok.  When the meal came out there was no sausage.  The assistant manager agreed that the service was horrible but made no real offer to accommodate other than bringing me a side of sausage links.  Never will I come into this location again."}
{"text":"This place is a well oiled machine for serving quick cheap hot breakfasts. It was slammed with people waiting yet our party of two only waited 5-10 mins.  You can choose any 4 ala crate breakfast items for 8.95. Quality was good but not gourmet by any standard. Food was served quickly.  I would definitely go back for a sit down hot breakfast for about $10."}
{"text":"Wife and I visit here for breakfast about once a month. It's on par with most breakfast chains..service can be spotty....but we are early risers and not many choices for sit down breskfast. It's ok just don't expect great service all the time. The menu is typical breakfast fair. We did sign up for their rewards program. Which basically gets us coupons a few times a year, usually for 20% off our tab. All in all not bad"}
{"text":"This place used to be my family's goto dennys since its our closest location and have always had great service, but after todays bad experience with the new staff i wont be going back till they get new staff, or train the current staff. All i see is a bunch of new lazy unproffesional employees. Sagging pants, attitude, the lady picking up the plates and cleaning tables was more attentive and proffesional than any of the staff here, bring the OGs back!!! And keep the cleaning lady ofcourse!"}
{"text":"Had my daughters birthday breakfast here.  Was seated immediately,  which was nice on a Saturday morning.  Leah was our server and she was very nice.  Took our order and our food was brought out quick.  Ordered pancakes,  eggs,  bacon... The normal breakfast items.  Leah brought my daughter an ice-cream sundae for her birthday.  I loved that she cared enough to make her birthday morning special.  And I wasn't charged for my daughters breakfast.  Thanks guys!  My favorite Denny's and we'll be back next weekend."}
{"text":"The waitress was so talkative that she messed up my food when it came out. She was so loud when I was trying to order."}
{"text":"I've been to this Denny's a couple of times and its been consistently just OK.  The staff is a bit frazzled during busy times so double check your order and be prepared for stuff missing. The food is Denny's, what can I say. Its filling inexpensive and if u become a member you get 20% off coupons regularly. So that's good. Really, its a diner...I've been to better...I've been to worse....have at!"}
{"text":"I love this place. All the servers are pretty kick ass people, who always have a smile on their face. The managers are also pretty amazing they always greet their customers with a friendly hello and smile. They are fast and make sure that everything is always clean and done right."}
{"text":"Shitty service. Took forever to get our food, forgot the coffee. And the place is less than a quarter empty. Lazy ass crack head looking servers. Don't come here."}
{"text":"caught lunch at Denny's at 8000 W Sahara and was more than pleasantly surprised. This is Denny's after all. Not exactly a 5 star dining establishment, or is it? Service was prompt and courteous and the burger was great - done just the way I like it. Would recommend to all who want fast and attentive service, good food and a budget friendly price."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't bother reviewing a Denny's. It's a Denny's for crying out loud, and if you're  nit picking the quality of Denny's cuisine, you probably need to get out more.  That being said---- THE PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE ARE SO NICE!   When it comes to greasy cheap diner food, sure you can go somewhere more unique .. But I've been here multiple times and everyone working there is so friendly and helpful.  I've looked around the restaurant while dining too-- and for low brow food, the crowd can be quite rude and picky so how these misters and misses stay so upbeat is beyond me.  And the food ain't that bad!"}
{"text":"waited more than half an hour and had to leave without food eventually. Very dissapointed with the service. Please look for other options."}
{"text":"Pretty good. They're packed , so expect to wait, but the food was consistent with any other Dennys..... It's not fine dining. For the price you'd pay at the Arizona Grand Resort next door for one person, you can get a better breakfast/lunch for 3.  Staff is slammed , so you get the occasional mixup, but overall, it's a much better choice for the area for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with food poisoning but I got it here. I ordered an egg white omelet with American cheese, onions, and tomatoes. What I received was something that looked like they emptied the garbage can in it. Looked like old spinach, old mushrooms, and who knows what else. Why did I eat it ? I didn't feel like the hassel. I stayed up all night throwing up, and I thought I was going to die. I went in for a refund the next day and the manager said I needed to produce a receipt ; of coarse, I had thrown it away. You really need to think it through before eating there. THINK TWICE BEFORE EATING THERE."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! It wasn't even busy and we waited 30 minutes before someone came up to our table to ask anything. We asked for the manager and she helped us. After that, we asked for refills on our coffee and we waited 10 minutes for that. Our food was cold and didn't even get our order right. Our server who was given to us was rude and had no care to help us. In the end, the store manager was rude and didn't offer to compensate something on the bill after he knew our service was crappy. This is the worst Denny's I've been to. Save your time and don't bother coming."}
{"text":"Dont eat breakfast at your hotel...too expensive..instead walk to this Denny's!!! Short wait, fast food, cheap! I wish I could remember my servers name...he was Latin and had a trainers tag on....he was super awesome even if he was in the weeds!!!! Hope u read this and thank u for being so awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Hvis du har lyst p√• \"litt\" mat fra en ekte Amerikansk Diner i Las Vegas, er Denny's stedet! Rask og god service, nydelig mat og fine priser. Porsjonene er, som s√• mange andre steder i USA, enorme. Jeg ble i alle fall ekstremt mett alle gangene jeg spiste der. Anbefales"}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with some friends for breakfast. The food wasn't anything special...just a plain 'ol diner breakfast.  I ordered the ham and eggs with hashbrowns and toast.  It came out on 3 small plates. LOL Apparantly they were out of bigger plates.  The ham was about the size of a cell phone-a little on the small side I thought but whatever.  Eggs good, hashbrowns, good, toast cold with barely any butter.  The place was clean and the waitress was super attentive.  All a good average experience."}
{"text":"I usually love this Denny's. But tonight was ridiculous. My friends and I arrived around 2:36. The lady was completely rude. Seated us at 2:40, and told us \"she had a couple tables to cater to before us.\" So we sat there and waited. It wasn't until 3:00 (20 minutes later) that we decided to get up and leave to IHOP across the street.   Upon exit, the lady, who referred to herself as \"MJ\", walked over to another booth and began talking to the guests seated there about us. All four people in the booth turned and looked at us through the window, and just stared at my friends and me. And she continued to talk to them about us as they all stared, including her.  My advice, if you want a late night meal, come to IHOP, not Denny's. That lady was awful, and IF I ever go back there, and she is there, I will walk right back out."}
{"text":"Poor service, extremely poor. They make you wait to be seated even when the place is empty. They take forever to bring food"}
{"text":"Still same Denny's.  Terrible if not horrific service.  Food takes forever.  Have not seen my waitress for the last 15 minutes.  Appetizer still in limbo land.  No acknowledgement from the staff at all.  Worst part of all.  The supposed manager, a hefty lady who seems to struggle to run the business bluntly ignores ganders and stares from her consumers for assistance.    If I did not have a soft spot for Denny's because of past history I would literally condemn this place due to lack of compassion and empathy for their patrons.  Great.  Just got my appetizer 30 minutes into the meal.   Burnt and crispy.  Exactly how I don't like it.    Oh. Yeah me.  Just got my meal two minutes later.    Denny's. You never cease to amaze me.    FIRE THE MANAGER.  Last update.  This is the timeline of events.   Come in 10:00 Order food and drinks simultaneously 10:05 Appetizer comes out. 10:35 Food comes out.  10:38.  Bill comes out. 10:45.    Good job Denny's of maintaining your terrible status."}
{"text":"Service was not bad, but food...emm...I'm really not a picky person for food but this place the food went far below my expectation. I know it's Denny's so never expect 5 star food. Maybe I should read more reviews on Yelp next time."}
{"text":"The food was great, staff was attentive. Great location and trustworthy instead of trying a bunch of new places in vegas."}
{"text":"Second time here. We stop after a movie night with friends. The food was tasty and the service excellent, the server came plenty of times to the table to make sure we were ok. Adding this place  to the list of future visits."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! 2 unfriendly hostess in front were talking to each other and we had to ask them to seat us. Then it took 15 minutes to approach our table and that was after we asked for help. The food was ok."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try based on reviews on here and other sites BUT I have to say that my first experience with Denny's was wonderful.  Our server Nancy was super cordial and accommodating, especially when I couldn't decide what to eat and she offered to come back. Our food came out at the same time even though mine was ordered last. Each dish was hot, fresh and just generally good. I think the only complaint food wise was my mothers eggs had too much cheese in them but it didn't stop her from eating them and sure wouldn't stop me! My super bird sandwich with bacon cheddar tots was super delish and when I asked for mayo, Nancy promptly returned with it. It wasn't busy at all but from one server to another, Nancy was wonderful and so was our food and very first Denny's experience!!!  I intend to return and hope to give Nancy another well deserved tip!"}
{"text":"Place is obv always busy...great food...service from staff could be a bit better..they need to check on the customers a bit more..if anything is needed etc. also.....the kids menu is in black and white now?????? Why??? please please change this back to color!!! thts ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time that we have eaten at this location and the service has been 0 stars every time. They take your drink order but fail to bring it for 10 to 15 minutes. This last Time we went there was Saturday, Veterans day and they  had 2 servers , were still setting up for the day, there were fewer than 10 people in the restaurant and it still took over 45 minutes to get our meal, waiting on refills, condiments etc, horrible service, last time for me at this location."}
{"text":"This place is amazing any time of the day if you are looking to have breakfast! Denny's has a clean environment, the service is fast, and there is lots to choose from.  I had the All-American Slam with scrambled eggs, sausages , hash brown, bacon, and toast. Would definitely go for some pancakes next time!"}
{"text":"Don't care what people think about this one The food is good. Great selection always hot I like the coffee  Great staff--especially a man named 'Grant' he is hilarious and always provides great entertainment  Sometimes the food gets on the greasy side Overall, good!"}
{"text":"Best Dennys Ive ever been to. Clean, great service, good attitudes, fast serving times, delicious food."}
{"text":"This location was terrible. It smelled rotten inside the dining area like sewage and it took over an hour to get our food! It was the longest I've ever had to wait!"}
{"text":"At my work we come here pretty often. We call and place our order and then someone goes to pick it up. We have had the times where they forget forks and knives or some kind of condiment and that's normally no big deal, however today I was treated horribly. First and for most they forgot one food item so I had to drive back and get what was paid for. Well when I walked in to talk to the girl at the register and inform her we called about a missing meal, she looked lost. A young guy came up and started giving me an attitude, I don't appreciate that especially when it is your fault my food was not in the bag the first time around. When I simply asked if there was anything they could do for the compensation for me having to drive about 15 minutes back there the guy told me they don't do that with the most obnoxious attitude I have ever seen. Now normally id just let this go and move on with my day but I just couldn't believe I got that kind of service. Now mind you I was nice about it and even offered my receipt to show it was paid for and all I wanted was my food. Once I got the attitude from this guy I was done. I took my food and headed back to work. But what is worse is once I got here I took my food out and guess what they STILL forgot to give me syrup for my pancakes. Like really guys... Normally when someone gets pancakes or French toast they like syrup. Thank god my coworkers saved some of theirs for me. I will NOT be going back to this location again. im so disappointed. I work in customer service and that is not how you treat a customer at all. Management should really check their employees attitudes and how they chose to handle customers."}
{"text":"It all depends on what you order, when you go in, & who is serving you. We have the best experienes at night(usually). Especially when Shelby is our waitress. She's a doll. She's elderly, but does her job damn well & quick. And with a friendly-ness & kindness you just don't see anymore.our cups were never empty either. I didn't even have to ask for a to go box she brought 2. After putting our food in the box, I asked for a to go bag since we were walking. She took our empty plates & came back with a bag quickly & put our boxes in the bag for us. She truely was the best waitress Ive ever had. On another night, I was with my dad instead of my boyfriend, enjoying a cup coffee & the waiter was very inaatentive & acted as if we were bothering him by asking for a refill. He was older, around his mid-late thirties. He made alot of comments that made us both very uncomfortable. He asked where I lived, I said in Phoenix. He said I figured that but where? Like which street? Where do you  work at? I told him I don't work. He asked how I make money I told him my boyfriend provides for us. Then he asked how much he makes. I replied with a very curt \"he provides for us very well & I am very happy, serious, & secure with my relationship\" He also asked my dad how old I was said I was very attractive & asked if I was available. I was in the bathroom at that time. I will ask for a new waiter if I ever see him again. Overall, it's our usual spot."}
{"text":"Customer service from the staff and the manager....slim to none. Stood in line waiting to be seated without any acknowledgement, even though the manager was standing at the front register. When asked if we would be seated, a tone full of attitude was received, \"I'll be with you in a minute.\" Because standing around for a few minutes must have indicated we could wait even longer. It wasn't super packed, we saw 3-4 servers walk by, not one said \" We'll be with you.\", \"Sorry for the wait.\" Another woman waiting longer than us also felt ignored. Yet, when another couple of a different race walked in, the server came right over within 10 seconds asking who was next....... probably the 2 parties who had been waiting for 10 minutes, not the party who just walked in the door. We verbally complained and walked out with the manager STILL standing at the front register NOT assisting us, once again stating she'd be with us in a minute with the same attitude she had before.  Went across the street to IHOP who's customer service was great from the second we walked in, who's restaurant was busier than Denny's but functioned like a well organized, non discriminating establishment."}
{"text":"Picked up a to-go order and when I got home, only half of my order was there. I called and let them know and they asked me to go back to pick the rest up. When I got there, the items were not what I even ordered. I asked the manager if there was anything that she could do for me for the trouble (extra 15 minute drive and now cold food waiting for us at home, plus food in my bag that isn't what I ordered) and she just said \"uhmmm do you want a coffee or orange juice?\".. that's just not good management or customer service to me. It's a mistake, I get it. But make it right.. don't act like it's crazy that I'm asking you to compensate for my time and poor experience. My time is valuable, and I feel like I just wasted time and money on this Sunday morning that I was trying to make special."}
{"text":"Been waiting for 35 mins and still no coffee. They sat down five over people after us and they already have There food! Worst service ever I will defently never come back here again!"}
{"text":"As we arrived, there was no host to seat us at a table for my friends & I of 4. This is at 12:30 finally get sat at 12:45, then we sat for another 20 min before being greeted by a server who asked if we were ready to order without any menus. She proceeded to ask us what we would like to drink & we ordered water for all of us. Then as we proceeded to wait for our food. During our course, the waitress asked us if we would like more water & forgot about the refill. Our food was very delicious and well needed after a long day at work. Horrible serivce, great food."}
{"text":"The only reason I went to that place is because there was nothing else open at this time of the night. The food is not so good. The place has a very unpleasant feel to it maybe because of the location. It's not too clean. The service was pretty slow, taking into account that there were only eight customers. Not going there again."}
{"text":"Horrible place to eat. The service does not seem interested in taking care of customers. The food came out incorrect after a 30 minute wait and the waitress never came back to check on us. After we ate I had to stand at the register for 10 minutes to Cash myself out. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Waitress took 15 min to bring us our drinks and food was cold when we received it. And this was when it was slow. Will not be going to this establishment again."}
{"text":"Very bad. Although the staff were friendly it took a while and our food came out before our drinks. In our group all of us except one of my friends got his food first and it took a while for them to realise he'd ordered a burger. We didn't even get any water from the table which we ordered. I ordered a chicken classic burger, the chips were nice and the burger was fairly nice but there were aspects that weren't such as my plate dripped off fat as I lifted my burger off the plate and you could tell it wasn't as fresh as it should be. But the staff were still really friendly which saved it from being a 1 star review."}
{"text":"Great waitress, Karla... She's very wonderful & helpful... Great food, prices & wonderful employees... Very clean as well..."}
{"text":"Got to go. Build your own grand slam  . Was fast and exactly what I wanted . Eggs cooked perfectly . Hashbrows cook perfectly . Service was good. Dennys over ihop all day"}
{"text":"It was okay . I came in at 1130pm and didn't feel any energy. it was freezing and my ass was cold af sitting in the seats. Food was pretty good tho"}
{"text":"I went for the first time today, and I'd have to say it was great. The service was quick and I did not wait long for my food. I got the buttermilk pancakes with butter and syrup and they were really good. For dessert I got a sundae that was also quite good. I had surprisingly never gone to a Denny's before and I would say it was a good experience."}
{"text":"At any other usual Denny's we are expected to wait a while since we are a party of eight which is understood. However we were told we would wait an hour. We waited for about 45 minutes, and we went inside to ask if they knew how much longer it would be and the host was very rude and stated she didn't know, and then when asked if she could state a time she said 45 more minutes. It's ridiculous, and she had the biggest attitude. She should learn a little more about customer service."}
{"text":"For a cheap eat in Vegas without getting botulism, this is your place.  Denny's is a stand up place with good prices and great food.  Their breakfast is so much better than most of the restaurants in even the most foo fooy casinos in Vegas.  Stick to the basics...Denny's is great."}
{"text":"Late night hunger with limited choices and usually having good experiences at Denny's my bf and I chose to eat Denny's on a Wednesday early morning (12am). The place was not very busy but it took FOREVER to get our food. It took a while to get our order taken but once taken I ordered a sandwich with a salad (very limited cooking involved) and my bf ordered the Moons Over my Hammy. The salad must have taken 30 minutes to come out. A side salad does not take much preparation time. I at the salad and much much MUCH later our sandwiches came out and they were wrong. I ordered tomato with mine, easy sauce, It came without tomato and a lot of spread. I felt like the cooks could care less that it took forever. The waitresses seemed a little more in tune but it seems like everyone was slacking off. I think the manager was there and he too was slacking. There was a lot of bickering going on between the waitresses and the cooks. The total time there exceeded an hour and half... FOR A COUPLE OF SANDWICHES!! By far the worst Denny's Ive been to. So sad because I usually like Denny's. The manager needs to get it together and make sure the staff is running efficiently and smoothly."}
{"text":"Since I manage to find My BadSelf in here at least once every few months I suppose You need to understand ~ OMG, Why? ~  First off; Nostalgia! During the 70's My Friends, along with a Guy in Gold Lam`e UnderWear, a Girl in a JC Penney's Bra and Slip and occasionally Myself would end up Here. Every Weekend after the LateNight, DoubleFeature, PictureShow (RHPS) @ the Sombrero Theatre. This is where You would find Us gathering, it was Our; Arnold'sDrive-In / FrostyPalace / Mel's Drive-In.  The fact that it is Still Here, unlike The afore mentioned; SombreroTheatre, Sambo's (on 1st Street and McDowell), Caf`e Casino along with Cin`e Capri (at 24th Street and Camelback), LuntAvenue MarbleClub (on the NorthEast corner of Central and Camelback), Willy&Guillermo's, OscarTaylor, The MasonJar, The (Original) Monastery, et cetera...... After Developers, Speculators and their ilk were finished generally tearing up the place, there wasn't a lot of recognizable, comfortable landmarks and haunts left for Us native & semi-natives. So once ~ facebook ~ starting bringing Us all back together, what better place for Us to reminisce with old friends than with Our old hangout...  The food is not \"world-class cuisine\" it does not need to be, it's the old comfort food We remember, golden eggs, fluffy pancakes, tasty O.J. and fresh, hot coffee. Added bonus; on Your birthday, breakfast is free!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: star for offering a free DIY grand slam on the day of your birthday with valid ID, and friendly host and cleaning staff.  Cons: slow service - received food but no utensils, took a while to get utensils; asked for salsa for one of the meals, however received half way through the meal, received someone else's bill, however took so long that we physically looked for the table that we thought might've had what was on the receipt and complete an exchange; our bill still had some discrepancies, however although minor, this was not fully taken care of at the front."}
{"text":"I originally got weird vibes from the place . but I don't judge books by their cover so I stopped there with my girlfriend. The waiter was utterly ridiculous with his service yet the food was good so we ignored our surroundings. To start he took his order by sitting next to my girlfriend which was startling and just weirded us both out. Then secondly went outside and looked as though he was buying drugs from a sketchy looking friend that left after their conversation.  To continue he came in and didn't even wash his hands after smoking .he continued by serving us our food and disappearing. If you see a guy missing teeth watch out and be prepared for the worst dining experience ever. The only reason it got three stars was cause I was in this case unfortunately hungry and close. Cook at home if it comes down to it."}
{"text":"The people who work here are not qualified at all.  Had to repeat my pick up order multiple times and the food ended up being wrong. Called them to fix it and again had to repeat the order many times. Got frustrated and asked for a manager. The manager too did not know how to take an order. I don't understand why it was so hard."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but as of lately there just isnt the same quality service as before. Service is slow, even past 10pm. My friends and I went there at around 12am for a late night bite, and I can't say I was too happy. Our waitress was nice, but I did not like the fact she took it upon herself to make decisions that made our ticket more $$. My friend and I ordered the Chicken Strip dinner which comes with two sides (and I asked for it as a chicken strip dinner, then she asked what my two sides were, and I told her). Same thing with my friend. Once the food came out, everything was in seperate plates. When I asked the server why everything was in seperate plates, she stated she put the order in with everything separate so that my friend and I would get more chicken strips than what the dinner comes with. So basically, apparently we looked like we needed more than 4 chicken strips and bigger sides than what it came with. This was more expensive than getting the dinner. I wanted to be nice, so i bit my tongue. But this is unacceptable. You don't take it upon yourself to order someone more food and order everything as a seperate appetizer than what was ordered. After the long time we waited for our food at a time in which it wasn't that busy, I was not too happy. I feel like the food standards and service has gone downhill... why even ask me what I want to eat if you are going to change my order to charge me more? I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Chilly inside.  Terrible service.  Empty tables while people are standing outside waiting for service. Another restaurant close to the ballpark could put this one out of business."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered us some breakfast to go. We have been to this Dennys before a while ago and have had this happen before. When I get there and pay, the lady Anna watches me as I write the total on the recepit. She said to me that I'm supposed to tip on to go orders. Who in their right mind asks for a tip? Totally ridiculous and so rude! I had this happen last time at this same location before.l, except they said don't forget to leave a tip before we had paid. Of course I'm not going to with that attitude. I spoke with the manager who just said, \"I'm sorry blame it on me. I'll talk to her.\" That's it. You lost customers for life."}
{"text":"It seems that Denny's has gone under new management and so has this Denny's. I have noticed all the workers are of one race and they are very rude and unprofessional. I went into this establishment last week and as I walked in nobody spoke or said hello until I gave them a look. The cooks are perverts and instead of cooking they are always talking and laughing. The manager kept look at me and my friends like we were doing something and he kept walking by. The waitress was old, rude, and kept forgetting our drink orders. I will pass on this Denny's from now on. I think they need to get new management and new servers because they are unprofessional and too slow."}
{"text":"I've had bad experiences like everyone else at this Dennys, but I've had far more good experiences and I would prefer to highlight those because they happen more often. It's a Dennys, you know the menu and the service, but that's average, this place is better than most and I enjoyed going so much when i did, i returned more than once.  Food was hot and delicious even at 3am, however the service late at night isn't the best, nor should anyone expect it to be, it's 3am. Early morning is the best time to go in my opinion, never had a bad time during the morning hours. If i were you, I'd avoid the weekends as it certainly gets busy during those times. I definitely recommend the Holiday menus, best choices by far.  I went this morning- waitress was nice, food was speedy, hot, and delicious."}
{"text":"I asked one question and they replied so rudely like almost yelling at me I couldn't believe it never coming here don't recommended it at all"}
{"text":"I used to go to the one on baseline everyday but the manager and staff on country club is just as good.. I get the same thing every day and all the employees know know my name and my order... they got WiFi they cold air conditioning, and I like the claw games.  Love you all, peace out."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Dennys location, so I felt compelled to report on my great experience here!   Upon entry, the hostess was extremely friendly and the sever was just as accommodating and gracious throughout the entire dining experience. My friend and I ordered the \"Build Your Own Grand Slam\", which was the \"select your own 4\" of everything from fluffy pancakes to sausage links and everything in between, so we appreciated being able to get a little taste of everything.   My friend also took advantage of their healthier options, opting for egg white scramble, and it appeared their menu featured many other dining options to this healthy degree as well, which we may opt for in the future.   The server was very attentive with frequent refills and courteously fulfilling any of our other requests, so that alone earns the 5 star rating. We also found the value for your money to be stellar, with both of us filled to the brim for under $20 each.   Would definitely recommend Denny's if you have a hankering for good quality breakfast fare, especially if you're a night owl (such as myself) and are seeking good grub at all hours of the night!"}
{"text":"I should have checked here first. This Dennys was by my hotel so I stopped for breakfast. 8:00 am and I am the only one in here??? What's up? Well after 10 minutes a waitress finally shows up. The hostess never went to get anyone because she was busy mopping the entire place. Guess they are short of help. Anyway it took a half an hour to get an omolete... I took one bite and pulled an 18 inch long black hair out of my mouth.  I was done!!!! Waitress said manager was busy, paid for my coffee and went to McDonald's across the street.  YELP should allow for a -1 rating as a 1 somehow might be mistaken as me still slightly recommending this s**t hole.  STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Nice job. We told the server we were in a hurry and all orders came in 3 minutes. We couldn't believe it.  Way to go. Our server was Senen."}
{"text":"We stopped in Thursday night at 10:30 pm and had breakfast. It was amazing, everything was perfectly cooked. The service was outstanding. There were just two waitresses and they were doing an outstanding job. Sorry I don't remember their names but we were there Thursday, September 15, 2016. Thank you."}
{"text":"Good food.  Amanda is an amazing waitress!!  AARP discount and senior menu. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My experience here at this Denny's was probably the worst experience I have had at a Denny's be before. Our server Logan was terrible his attitude was sucked, his service was slow and he made us feel very unwelcome. We usually have a great time at Denny's, This was our second time at this location. The first one was good but this one was horrible. I probably will not come back to this location and I will continue to go to the one on Chandler Boulevard and i-10 freeway where we geet the service we expect."}
{"text":"I love Denny's. I love the idea of Denny's. I love diner food. This location is a good one. It is clean and the restrooms are really clean. (A major thing in my book). Sometimes servers disappear when you need them after you get your food. But the other servers make up for it. Service over all is wonderful. The food is good, and they are quick to fix any mistake. They have their ups and downs but over all it is good. I keep coming back. Most servers know me by face and I get warm greetings. And that makes my day."}
{"text":"I went here for the birthday deal (free grand slam) in the morning. I was seated promptly and the waitress came within 5 minutes to ask if I need a drink. I had some water and then informed her that I was just here for the birthday deal. She asked for some government id to verify and apologized for the inconvenience and said it was protocol. She was really nice and helpful throughout, unfortunately I didn't get her name. Anyways, normally you get the traditional grand slam but I explained that I couldn't have meat so she offered to ask and see if she could replace the bacon and sausage with something else. Luckily she was able to and I got to replace it with hash browns and an english muffin plus the regular pancakes and eggs. It tasted great and was super filling! The service was fast and the food was perfectly cooked! They gave big portions and I couldn't have been more satisfied.  Just have some money extra for a good tip because the waiters/waitresses deserve it.  It was a great start to my birthday so thank you Denny's!"}
{"text":"Sat there for 20 minutes and no waiter approached us to even offer us drinks. Manager sucks too. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"This was about as bad as it gets there was no Appel  to eat there tables were dirty floors full of food  and the booth were all torn up had tape holding them tougher to hide the tears they had missing filling so was real louse way to try  to eat we got up and left without eating after waiting for 10  min to be seated and 15 more to try to get just some water with no luck please do Denny's a favor close it."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and the service was good. The only downfall was having to wait over 1 and half hour to get a table but once we placed our order, the orders came out quick."}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible management, terrible cook!!! First of all after waiting 15 minutes to order the food comes out and isn't what I ordered... I agree to keep the breakfast skillet and the server would have the cook make new meat.. Server blames cook for order being made wrong... She knows she lied and should have just taken responsibility for putting the order in wrong. I asked at the time for cinnamon sauce for the pancakes I ordered as well. 10 minutes later I had to go to the front and let another server know I hadn't received the sauce and that my eggs were over hard instead of over medium. I ask for the manager to be sent over... Another 10 minutes goes by the pancakes are cold the replacement meat and cinnamon sauce are delivered cold and the manager comes and says he's taking the eggs off.. I told him as a manager he should know what's happening at his store and his response was all I know about is the eggs... Bottom line DON'T GO HERE!! 1 hour in this place to leave hungry... Terrible customer service. Can't believe this guy is a manager... Maybe the owner of this place will look into what's happening at their business... The time was 8:30pm and the place had about 5 other tables dining. Wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much when I decided to get breakfast and try to get some work done here before sun rise.  It was here or a ubiquitous coffee shop but I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in.  It's actually very nice and a great place to eat and get some work done after hours."}
{"text":"I didn't have the greatest experience. I waited 25 minutes for nachos (that weren't good at all) and the place was pretty dead. My server didn't once check on me and eventually just put the check on my table and said \"Here you go\" and walked away. I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"HA ha! Gay Denny's natch! lmao! This place is awesome!!  In the daytime you can see several groups of people thinking about their would-be purchases in the near by car dealerships. But in the night time...  late night, say... 2AM-ish... this place comes to LIFE! The patrons of the nearby clubs and bars conviene here to get their late night munchies on! There's some major people watching going on!!   Go and hang out, scope out the MUCH smaller late night menu and have fun. :)"}
{"text":"This Particular Denny's makes me understand the reason why I only eat at I Hop and casions late night. I've had several bad experiences at Denny's and this one didnt help. After going to the club. My friend and I decided to stop for food and chat. The waitress was the only good experience.  She was nice and paid attention. But im not sitting there for the waitress. The food was very bland ans at one point I didnt even want to finsih my Skillet.  But I was hungry and a little tipsey so I had to eat. I know I had experience with food when I remember Not liking it after drinking. I've been to good locations before. But this isn't one."}
{"text":"This is the worse service ive ever had to deal with. It wasnt busy AT ALL!!!!! It was almost good until we ordered our food. Once the food got there we had to wait like 5 minutes to eat because Priscilla forgot to bring us our damn utensils  I ordered a mango and lemonade drink that was not good/sweet at all. She didnt bring us refills for water and as soon as we were done eating she seemed to kinda rush us out by bringing the bill, but we wanted dessert so we ordered and ice cream after waiting 10 mins for her to come back to the table. After we ate our sundaes she didnt bring us the new receipt with the new orders on it. And while we were waiting for that she sat down a whole different group and we overheard her making the same mistakes to the next people. We got tired of waiting so we used the receipt she first gave us, while we were checking out i guess she was clocking out and left the new guy that didnt know how to work the system split our bills"}
{"text":"While Denny's is not top of the list of places I frequent, if you live in the mid southeast and have a child in your universe, it is actually not a bad choice.  The service at this location, although a little quirky, is efficient and friendly.  The meals come in an appropriate amount of time and the food is always hot and \"fresh\". This location is also easy to get to off Deerfoot.  I do try to eat healthier than I did back in the day when Denny's=hangover cure. So sometimes I struggle with their menu. There are a lot more healthier choices now but with such a large menu of greasy cheesy goodness, it is hard to not indulge your inner teenager. But that is probably more my problem than there.  Where the child part comes into this review is that our resident child is 9 and he is at the age he can eat an adult portion but it takes him forever to decide what he wants. We find with breakfast, lunch and dinner options available all the time, it makes the process easier.  Some of their menu items really have a chain look and taste but recently I've tried some new additions and they seem less \"plastic\" and were quite tasty. In fact on our most recent visit I think I exclaimed  out loud \"This is actually really good-it's like real food\"."}
{"text":"I feel a bit weird reviewing a Denny's, but it was such a pleasant experience, I just had to.  As someone who travels for work, I eat at a lot of these places, and this is one of the best I've been to.  Nice remodel, efficient and friendly staff (really friendly), food cooked as ordered....what else could you ask for?   Whoever is managing this location is found it right, so kudos!"}
{"text":"Ended my 17 year Denny's boycott today. What a pleasant experience! Denny's has come a long way since I've been gone. I highly recommend the Sante Fe Skillet!"}
{"text":"After I dropped my son off at school, I went to Walmart to drop my car off for an oil change. Shortly after turning in the keys, my friend met me there and we drove off to Dennys to eat breakfast. They have the $2, $4, $6, and $8 deals. We couldn't resist because you pay little, but get a lot for you are paying. She ordered off of the $4 menu and ordered the Everyday Value Slam which consists of two buttermilk pancakes, two eggs cooked to order and two bacon strips or two sausage links. I ordered the $8 Grand Slam Slugger which consists of two buttermilk pancakes, two eggs, two bacon strips and two sausage links.  Served with your choice of hash browns, bread or grits.  Includes coffee and juice. The food was good and delicious. The waitress that served us was also on top of everything making sure that my friends water and my coffee with orange juice were constantly topped up until we said no more. Denny's is a great place to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"We just ate from Denny's restaurant. We called our order in because quite a few times we've had really crappy waitresses and they're always missing everything. Tonight we call the order in and guess what we got the same routine missing at least 20 percent of the stuff that we ordered. The order was not cook for I completely slept together. Everything tasted like crap. We call the manager Michelle she act like she really didn't even give a crap about it all she could say was sorry. She wanted us to come up and get the items that were missing we live on Memphis Ridge Road is all screwed up like people have that kind of time on their hands they should get the order right the first time. I've been to all the restaurants and never had this problem and if I did have a problem it would knock something off the bill or give us some kind of credit very bad customer service. That location should just shut their doors. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"avoid this place .as i was leaving the restaurant i saw the manager unload ice in an exposed  bucket from his car personal car. also the A/C was not working and the place look filthy."}
{"text":"Not bad! I'm a vegetarian and had the fit fare veggie skillet and it was actually pretty good. I like how it's served on the skillet it's cooked on. I wouldn't say it's the best quality food since it's not organic or anything, but for what it is..not bad! The service and staff were super polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Waited over 40 minutes for a pick up when it came half the food was not there.  Asked for missing food.  It came with the containers covered in ranch.  When I got home fries were so raw they were still white and unedible. Very  Disappointed I will not return"}
{"text":"My fiance and I both ordered a double cheeseburger. My fiance order medium well and received well done. The only part about this meal that I could not complain about is the size of the patties. But other than that, they were dry and extremely tastless. No seasoning whatsoever. Just some ground beef smashed together. Bun had no condiments on it whatsoever. No ketchup, mustard, mayo or anything. We paid extra to get the seasoned fries. Boy was that a mistake. The fries were so old. They were extremely cold and chewy. Not only that, the food was about 30 minutes late. So we paid almost $40 for 2 hamburgers, a small amount of really old fries. I WILL NEVER order from this place again!!!! Most disgusting hamburger I have ever had. I would have rather had McDonalds. And I hate McDonalds."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. From service to food. Make the trek to dennys on queen st in brampton to get good service. Never again will I come to this nasty location. The food was awful. Burnt food that came late. When I went into the restroom, there was no soap I  the dispenser. Spoke the restaurant manager who didn't seem to care. SMH."}
{"text":"Stood at the register waiting to be seated while two waitresses sparred about whose responsibility some of the work belonged to that day. While waiting for our order our waitress had to tell the two tables adjacent to ours that they were \"out\" of what was requested. I got the same thing when I asked for avocado. Service was minimal while we ate, no refills on soda, and the toast was forgotten with the Grand Slam that was ordered. Instead of the shake I ordered I was given a vanilla shake. If we'd waited for her to check with us again the shake would have melted. After spending 15 minutes on our phones with empty plates at the end of our table we got tired of waiting and went to the register where the manager struggled to reconcile our bills.  Can't rate lower than a 1. 0/10 would not wait again"}
{"text":"decided to come here yet again with my boyfriend and the same woman from my previous review was there, running around every where back and forth seemingly overwhelmed although the diner was not too busy. had multiple arguments with the cook who was also helping by walking out the orders and serving tables... i took my food to go and it would have been fine but I asked for sides... extra fries, avocado and jalape√±os on my burger etc & was charged for all of that but got none of it... didn't even want to say anything or argue it with the waitress because she already seemed a hair away from snapping. probably will never ever return. everyone in the diner was complaining. maybe waitressing just isn't this woman's fort√©, but man oh man has this place gone down the drain."}
{"text":"Food is great. I ordered the Country Fried Steak & Egg Skillet (steak was a lil too salty) My boyfriend got the T-Bone Steak and Shrimp with Cheddar Mashed Potatoes. It was so good, I recommend it. Place was cold and the carpet could use a little vacuuming. Liz was a great server, she always made sure our drinks were filled.  4 stars!"}
{"text":"Probably the most disgusting Denny's I have ever been in.  Food cold, servers took forever.  I would definitely not bother with this location."}
{"text":"Susan kept our coffee full with a smile!  My uncle and I stopped in for pancakes, eggs, bacon, and waffles.  Though we had fresh coffee the entire time, the coffee itself wasn't the best.  My Belgian waffle was cooked to a crisp but it would benefit from 30 seconds less.  This Denny's is fine just don't expect anything over the top."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast at Denny's, being the cupboards were bare, I ordered coffee and obv it was cracked as leaking , the waitress finally walked by and said I'll bring you more coffee I said No it's leaking and I don't want it, she brought our food after a long wait, I finally went for our bill and the other waitress asked and she said yeh take a coffe off , she said it leaked, well that pissed me off, then went to register handed her a hundred she whipped the receipt up and said do you want to put a t on the charge , I said No I just handed you a $100, oh yeh right. , I know I live in a Sr area but don't try to scam us , ugh no more Dennys, I wouldn't lie that a cup was leaking , what is wrong.  I took forever to get our meal, we live in Sun City Grand and  will not be going back, never saw her after order or once she sat it down, had to ask for bill, oh we also froze it was so cold in there asked to get it warmer said they couldn't change it, obv set for the staff not the clients"}
{"text":"Never again!!  I ordered through the Denny's app.  1. When the delivery driver dropped off the food she completely over reacted and flipped out when I opened my door and my extremely friendly shi tzu ran up to greet her.  She acted like she was about to kick my dog and nearly threw the bag of food in the air.  I told her my dog is very friendly and there is no need to act that way.  She told me she hates dogs and walked away all rude.  2. Opened my bag of food and it wasn't even my damn order!!!   3. Called Denny's to get my food order fixed and they had no idea how to handle this huge mistake.  I spent 15 min on the phone with them while they tried to figure out how to handle this and get me my correct food I ordered as well as telling them I don't want cold food, I ordered hot food.  4. Almost two hours after initially ordering my food from Denny's I am still starving and now I don't even have time to eat my breakfast when it gets here as I have to go to work... hungry...  besides..it's lunch time now! 5. Dennys, you are a complete waste of my time and money."}
{"text":"When there again. Figure I give it another shot.well nope same thing happened again another order of burnt toast. I love Denny's I honestly think they are better than IHOP. I'm going to have to find another one to go to."}
{"text":"Horrible.!!! The worst!!!  Me and my husband went to this place on vacation .We had a long wait got to the table and had to wait even more..The waiters were so incompetent most seemed to be philiphino which I thought was illegal to hire only one race.according to the civil rights act of 1964.This is America all people united..gosh was amazed... Unbelievable..The English was pretty broken.. I asked to have someone else help me that could understand me better....Well then the guy waiter who seemed arrogant brought me my coffee I said it's cold.Brought me another cup..It was the same coffee only microwaved..The cup was hitter than what was inside it burnt my fingers he didn't care.I had to ask for cream twice.It came after 10 minutes again the coffee was cold he did not offer to change it....Then took are orders ..oh he asked would you like cheese ,onions avocado added.I said ok because there prices aren't that cheap...A breakfast cists over 10 dollars simple pancake and the topping was pure sugar with cream my stomach hurt so bad could not finish it ..Only took four bites..My hashbrowns were so hard from all the the grease..I think there friend in just butter the eggs they tasted like cardboard..My kids were like mommy...The chicken fingers were hard they looked like the frozen type that came out of a box..Just heated up..They must not have chefs here whoever cooks does not do the job it was everything was cooked in butter .I mentioned it to a manager.He just gave a nervous laugh..which was scary...His hands looked filthy...My kid said whats wrong with him..I said work hard at school son don't want you in a place like this..it was so cold there was no ceiling dust appeared to be dropping everywhere.They never turned on the heater.I complained but again the manager was like a worthless wonder...When I got my bill it amazed me about the add ons and the prices information I  was told with all of our add ons came out to be 15.00 more.we we're not told it would be extra charges.The avocado was like a teaspoon ..The cheese just thrown on top of the hashbrowns.My husband ordered the 2 for 1 mimosa.The picture showed a large glass.When it came it was small.This is called false advertising..but nobody there seemed to care when we mentioned it...My family was not happy and when we payed are billed they asked us do want to leave a tip.We looked at each other and said for what...Experience awful..Stay aware your family well thank you!!.."}
{"text":"6/4/2016@ 10:33. My name is BARBARA Alexander a 51 year old black female truck Driver was at this place and I won't ever come back I been waiting for a waitress for twenty minutes and the manager was right in front of me rolling silverware up in a napkin conversating with another employee laughing as if I wasn't here..then came in four groups of people to be seated and waited on the manager seats them tells me she will get to me next which never happened then two came and sat down next to me to my left and right away they recieved a menu then a cup of coffe one the other ice tea then the waitress comes to take my order her name Petra and the manager asks me have a I been helped that manager name is Diedre who goes by D well my food finally came o ut after being the last one to GET waited on so I was the last one to GET served after being the first out of the five I figure it was because I was black"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Being told we cannot be seated in 15 minutes, with at least 5 or 6 tables wide empty and plenty of staff walking around.  Never ever come back."}
{"text":"Good ol' Denny's. When I want a quick fix for breakfast food, usually I would come here. The meals are affordable, but even at around $13 for breakfast food, you may find better value at another breakfast joint.  However, if all you need is pancakes then this place is great! Oh, and IHOP!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Denny's a few times, it usually wasn't too bad but the last time I went, it was ridiculous. I ordered the cinnamon pancake breakfast. First the waiter brings my meal without the pancakes because apparently they got the order confused. I waited about 10 minutes and got my pancakes, only they weren't the cinnamon pancakes. They had strawberries on them. I called the waiter back and told him. He apologized and said he apparently had it right the first time, so he'll bring them out. He brought out new pancakes, and this time they were peanut butter. Again, I call the waiter over. He again apologized and 10 minutes later brought out new pancakes. These ones had chocolate drizzled over them, still not the cinnamon pancakes. My boyfriend finally asked for the manager and a menu to point to which pancakes I wanted. The manager apologized and told us our meal would be free, but they gave up on trying to get me the right pancakes. Terrible customer service, and how is it so hard to make something that is on your menu? We definitely won't be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"What kind of a place that claims to be \"AMERICAS DINER\" doesn't have chef salad. That have these stupid trendy salads but they can't put together a chefs salad? C'mon Man!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, went there when it was dead, and still couldn't even get good service and even get a refill, forgot half the stuff we preferred and the food was burnt. The manager was nice, she said the waitress was new but there's no excuse for pure laziness she sat behind the counter on her phone the whole time, I won't be going back there,definitely don't recommend."}
{"text":"We end up at this Denny's because it is open 24 hours and halfway between my house and a friends house.  Every time we end up here we end up asking ourselves why we are here and didn't stop in ANYPLACE else!  When you walk in they ignore you for up to 20 minutes.  Often times I get bored and just seat myself because I'm tired of waiting.  After being seated or self seating, the servers take forever to acknowledge that you sat down and then they take even longer to bring drinks or food and good luck getting a refill or ordering dessert or anything else.  It is seriously some of the worst service I have ever had and not on just one occasion where one could assume being understaffed for whatever reason.  This is the worst service of any Denny's I have ever been to and some of the worst service in general.  Getting checked out when ready to leave is also nearly impossible.  We feel like unwelcome guests interrupting their day.  And we are adults with money who tip."}
{"text":"The food was ok. They were understaffed so our waiter took longer and did not check in on our needs. He was polite but did not pay enough attention to us because he had about 6 or 7 tables. The Bathroom was DISGUSTING and we asked for more coloring books for the kids as we left because theirs got wet,  and were basically ignored. Go to another Denny's."}
{"text":"If I could give Zero stars I would. I waited 1hour and a half for my food. When I received it it was cold and wrong. The grand slam had 1bacon and 1 sausage my eggs were not as ordered and the waitress an older caucasian lady argued with me. Absolutely no customer service not even a refund. Please do yourself a favor and go to the 1 on grand and reems where the old people go. Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ray is an exceptional server. We have never had bad service when Ray is our server. Manager Marvin always makes sure we are happy and works with us when we are not. Of the many Denny we have eaten at over the years and across this country, we have never been better taken care of than here."}
{"text":"The best Dennys I have ever been to. This location is so clean and well maintained. The staff here are friendly and welcoming! And the food even tastes better and less greasy than the other locations- albeit I always order breakfast items, but compared to the other Dennys, this one takes the cake in taste.  On weekday afternoons, this place is not that packed but during the weekends, most tables have occupants at them!"}
{"text":"Not busy on a Tuesday morning. Hashed browns were too hard and crispy, toast was toasted too long and had black edges.   No refills on coffee, we had to go up to the counter for our refills. Server came around once to see if we needed anything else and didn't come with coffee.    Didn't offer flavored cream although there was some available; I didn't notice until I asked the guy at the counter for the 3rd time and he gave me 2 hazelnut creamers in a handful from the collection of creamers.   Guy was bothered to check us out at the register. Ordered cheese on scrambled eggs and no cheese but still charged me. I figured they needed the 79 cents and I didn't notice until I was gone.    2 Stars because food was served quick."}
{"text":"They need more servers on duty, service was extremely slow, there was hair in my food, and it didn't come back accurate. They didn't bring my side of bacon, and having mentioned the hair, they probably should've comp'd my meal, but nope! We weren't checked back on to ensure quality, and we had to walk up front to pay, she never checked back. Just saying, I know its a diner but  hospitality shouldn't be sacrificed."}

{"text":"We had a delightful breakfast: the food was very good and our server was great. I had the Grand Slam: the eggs were light and fluffy, the bacon was cooked just right and the hash browns, sometimes difficult to cook right, were crispy on the outside and softer on the inside. My husband's vegetarian scramble was huge and delicious. We had forgotten how good and consistent Denny's could be. Very good breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is horrible me my husband and son went for breakfast and it took forever to get our food then when it came it was greasy and cold. Will never go back again. I would not refer this place to anyone!Stay away go to Bob Evans which is right next door. And the floor was so nasty had food all over the floor it look like when they wioe the table if they do that they just swipe it on the floor! Yucky!!!"}
{"text":"Deelicious food cooked perfectly great friendly service waitress was awesome fast service will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here many times for dinner and breakfast, staff and manager are very friendly and the food quality is good."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say that we had breakfast one morning (Dennys next to our hotel) a few weeks ago when in Scottsdale.  We had been eating at different places in Scottsdale since it was the first time in the city.   After trying another breakfast Restaurant down the street the day before we wanted to eat somewhere we knew.  The service was great they were friendly and helpful.  The food was great.  We both had the country fried steaks and that was the first time all week I eat everything on my place.  The coffee was good.  By the time I left  there I had a smile on my face.  Thanks Denny's staff you are awesome.  Thanks for making my day....."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have visited this Denny's and I have to say that every waitress that I have seen or had has been outstanding. They are so friendly and relatable.  They are very good at making me feel so welcome. I would highly recommend this particular location to anybody. The food was also fantastic."}
{"text":"Madison is the best she is very friendly and so nice she always knows exactly what we want she goes above and beyond and pancakes and hash browns perfect coffees good too (: ask for Madison if you go their # pancake and chocolate chip and banana lol and crispy hash browns"}
{"text":"Wow amazing after waiting 10 mins for the waitress to even approach us thats after another waitress told them someone in her section then no apology or addressing if there a problem here a strong lesson in customer service if a short maybe you should ask dig to find out if there any concern.  just cause you wait table your not obligated to be tipped a great server knows that.  So sad next time in vegas guess ill spend the money for im not stopping at this denny again im from pheonix an they do better then this"}
{"text":"I first want to say that I have gone to this Denny's now for the past two years and have never had an issue.  Tonight was that night.  I called in an order and was told it would be ready in ten minutes... standard for them.  I got there and 30 minutes later still had no food in my hand.  I asked to see the manager and the explanation she gave was, \"We've never had this many people come in on a Thursday.\"  She never apologized nor offered to make it right in any way.  I asked for my money back  I am no food service expert, but the goal of any food service establishment is to make sure customers keep coming back.  She totally failed to fix the situation.  I think it is time to take a break from this place.  The service is not what it used to be two years ago.  I will say that the people working there are very friendly.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night but I won't be back for a while.  Beware the wait time if you dare to eat here!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. I ordered the Ranchero Tilapia with sauteed zucchini & squash, and broccoli. This restaurant was not busy at all and it took about 20 minuets to get my order. I guess that's about normal. The place was very dirty. There was trash and dirt every where from the moment I entered the door. The service was okay and the food wasn't bad. My main complaint was the place just being so dirty, which is why I only gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"I came in hungry and left ready to pukr the food was horrible I dont recommend eating. There also the managet does not know how to wash her hands the food was undrr cookrd"}
{"text":"I have been to other Denny's before. But we decided to try out this Denny's and get some desserts. So we went in and ordered a sundae. The waitress got it confused and brought a banana split. When I pointed out the mistake she apologized profusely and got me the right dessert. Also she offered us the banana split completely free of cost. The desserts tasted superb.   I will surely go to Denny's to get more desserts in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but the game where you use the arm and try to grab stuff is too hard so it only gets four stars. If you go there I would suggest the French Toast Slam."}
{"text":"For a Dennys this place is legit.  I appreciate that it was clean, we had prompt service, everything was cooked well.  The new pancake recipe is AMAZING, best pancakes I've ever had!  We had the ones with bananas, caramel sauce, some kind of vanilla sauce, and these sweet crunchy things that I think might have been pie crust.  The texture of the pancake was a little squishy, like an edible sponge to soak up whatever goodness you put on there, without being soggy or gummy.  God damn those pancakes were good."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place ever never come here  you will never be attended I have sat here for 30 min and no one has came to take my order. Not even for drinks I had to get up myself and asked them to come help us they aren't even busy ...."}
{"text":"This Dennys refuses to participate in corporate specials advertised on tv and email.  Even after showing the coupon to the manager she refused to honor it.  Save yourself some frustration: go to a different Dennys."}
{"text":"I don't expect too much from Denny's. When I went they were understaffed, and I waited at the host stand for 5 or 6 minutes without anyone greeting me. The food was pretty slow, but it was decent for the crazily low price."}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost. Hostess is cashiering at the same time. No one is being seated even though there are tons of tables open. The manager buses table... Waiters chatting I the back. No one cares...."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this Denny's a one star. I ordered my food and waited 30mins for the grand slam. When I received my food it was ice cold and when I told my waitress about the cold food she asked if I would want them to remake it and of course I said yes and literally 3 minutes later, my waitress comes back with my plate and AGAIN it was ice cold and the cheese wasn't even melted on my eggs. I had them comp my plate off my bill and the manager I talked to didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. I would advice everyone to not go to this Dennys unless you don't want efficient food and rude service."}
{"text":"It's easy to be snobby about Dennys, but you know what? This is better than 80% of breakfasts on the Strip, and it'll cost you $7. On my last morning in Vegas I decided to branch out and try the American diner at New York New York, and it was a pale shadow in comparison (and cost at least twice as much).  The food is bang on the money - diner fare that'll keep you going for the rest of the day - and everyone who works there is friendly and competent. Sure, if you want to have a leisurely breakfast you could head over to Mon Ami Gabi over at the Paris (and you should, at least once), but if you want to eat well and get moving, Dennys has your back."}
{"text":"Food was good. Besides my hash browns being burnt...I would come again simply because my waitress was awesome and fixed the issue right away :)"}
{"text":"So it's Denny's. Big surprise your food wasn't gourmet and your veggie burger wasn't perfect. Cry me a river and please don't come back. This Denny's problem is Scottsdale. What a sense of entitlement. Most livable, whatever! My food came quit, waitress was active, just what I expected from a trip to Denny's. Good job."}
{"text":"It was good. Not much vegeterian options but desserts awesome. Very good ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Wow!! Absolutely gross... this place doesnt look clean at all!! First they sit me at a table where it looked like the cookie monster was eating... Food every where... Second off waited forever for my food... im actually a regular at the Rural road and 202 Dennys and will ONLY be eating there for now on... We only stopped here because it was on the way home and it was a bad decision!! Stay away!! Lol and the waitress just keeps trampling through it... Wow"}
{"text":"The good wasn't good plus messed up my kids order!! Sorry to say but employee seem so dumb!!"}
{"text":"We needed a quick breakfast and stopped at the Denny's on Mentor Ave.  The place was clean the help friendly but a bit slow the food was hit or miss.  My son's cinnamon pancakes were fine and bacon is bacon.  I ordered a red white and blue french toast breakfast.  Denny's idea of \"French Toast\" is to take a piece of \"wonder style bread\" with blueberries allegedly incorporated into the bread and put in on a grill until it become brown. When I told the waitress that this was not \"French Toast\" she told me that she saw the chef put the the bread on the grill. Someone should let  Denny's know that \"french toast\" involves coating the eggs into a egg mixture. The toast came with some of the worst scrambled eggs to ever hit a plate.  I sent it after a bite of the toast (this was not french toast) and driest scrambled eggs ever cooked.  The waitress actually thought she was doing me a favor by not charging me for the non-french toast. We were in a hurry so I didn't order anything else."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience that I've had at this Dennys. I've been here several times, but this time was bad. The remodel is nice, but it seems like there is new staff.   It started with the wrong drink order, then to the watery ranch dressing ( it literally tasted like water), and the dinner bread was not toasted very well very chewy. Prices have gone up as well.   I'm a wiling to give them one last try, but I will be looking for a replacement."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there for breakfast, waitress took our order and never came back to see if we needed anything. After about 20 minutes another employee brought our orders but everything was cold. Worst breakfast ever!"}
{"text":"this was the WORST Denny's experience I've ever had, and no one expects much from a Denny's so that's saying a lot. not only did our server jump in our faces to rush our drink order he didn't let us finish it before walking away and not getting what we requested. ignored us until our cold food showed up and it wasn't even what we ordered. he threw extra napkins from someone elses table on ours in a \"don't want to put these where they really go mannor\" and didn't show up again until he dropped our bill which charged me for the food I ordered bit didn't get. maybe he would've been a better server if the apparent drugs he was on weren't a factor, and when we confronted the manager she was rude and obviously didn't care that this staff sucks. not to mention unwelcoming to straight customers if any Denny's promoted itself as a straight Denny's would gays feel welcome there and would that be socially acceptable? hell no! way to go Denny's ihop for me next time!"}
{"text":"Amid all the extravagant casinos, shows, and people handing out porn on the strip, a Denny's can be found to appease your \"cheap and greasy\" food desires. It's about what you would expect from a Denny's, food wise. However, I happened to be particularly disappointed in this Denny's for the following reasons:  - Service. The water refills were few and far between. Hello? We're in the DESERT, and have most likely been drinking beer/alcohol all day. We need water, and lots of it. If you don't want to keep coming over to refill us, please just leave a pitcher on the table!  - Music. I can't even fully describe the weird 80's jazz stuff they had on, but I will say it was too loud, and too annoying.  The food tasted like I expected it to, so that's a good thing. But the fact that I was sitting there parched and thirsty most of the time, while meanwhile drowning in bad music, kind of ruined the whole thing for me."}
{"text":"I stopped for a quick bite to eat and sat at the counter since I was by myself. The chair I sat in almost killed me. It was missing a bolt and the seat fell of the base. The seat next to me was also broken and hanging on by a zip-tie. Other than the seating hazards the food was ok, although I never saw my server after she took my order."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled.  Good service, and impressed with the food quality.  Melissa was great!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the hostess up front is very good. She is very entertaining to watch. You can tell she loves her job. We got seated quickly but the food took a long while or else they would have gotten 5 stars. Recommend."}
{"text":"This place is by far the worst Denny's I have been too. The staff here is under trained and awful. It takes about an hour to get your food that eventually comes out cold. You can hear the servers arguing with the cooks in the back from the dining area. Nobody is ever willing to help cash you out and always makes you wait. Avoid the headache here and go down a few miles to IHOP."}
{"text":"bad location. Dirty dishes. Poorly cooked food. Wouldn't recommend anyone to eat here, id choose iHOP down the street. And I hate IHOP lol."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery last night and it got to my house right on time and they added extra syrups and forks and the food was so yummy !"}
{"text":"Went to Denny's at 9310 W. Tropicana Ave., Las Vegas, NV on 2/26/18 and had a bad experience.  We received a coffee cup that had red lipstick still on it from previous customer.  After I returned the coffee cup it was over 10 minutes until I received another cup of coffee.  Then it was another 20 minutes until we received our meals.  The manager stated that they had just brewed a new pot of coffee but I am sure you have more than one pot of coffee and it certainly does not take 10 minutes to brew if that was the case.  I was also told they were very busy but there were only a few customers and it seemed they spent more time checking out customers than attending to seated customers.  Not sure if they are under staffed but these excuses seem very lame to me.  I am not going to this Dennys ever again.  Sorry but will not be going to this Denny's anymore."}
{"text":"I have been twice in the past month with my husband and kids and once with my parents. Both times the food was good. The first time we had Shaq as our server and he was great. Very attentive. The second time we waited over twenty minutes to be seated and once we were the host was actually our server because they were so shorthanded. He did an okay job but was very nice. I will definitely go back I just hope they have added more staffing next time."}
{"text":"Came in around noon. The restaurant was not very busy. Yet, the waitress and host took their sweet time to seat a party of one.  Customers that sat after me got drinks before I did. Asking for a refill seemed like an endless task. Must be an off day for the staff here today!"}
{"text":"The service here was bad. Just right off the bat. I don't usually go to chain restaurants but I was craving a good old fashioned breakfast sandwich and thought, why not. The food was alright. What I had expected. but oh my goodness. I will give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt on bad service if it was busy but the entire restaurant only had 3 groups in it and we ended up having to get up and find someone to help us. I could see my food in sitting in the window for 10min before it was brought out to us. I doubt I will come back."}
{"text":"Terrible unless you like lipstick on your coffee cup. Service ok. Food was ok. Why is it all Denny's seem to attract unusual characters at night."}
{"text":"Kyle K was our server and he was super dope and a really respectful person. The young lady at the front was really polite and genuine. The food was also good! Great job to your crew at this Denny's!!"}
{"text":"0 stars ... worst service ever!! Never again.. DONT SIT A PARTY OF 5 at a booth for 4..... PAY MORE MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday during prime breakfast time (10am), so to ask for great service is always a stretch. We had this mentality going in but sadly we were still disappointed. Our waitress was Rosemary and she stopped at our tables only a few times; once to take our order, once to drop off our food, and the last time was to drop off our bill. Other than that we had to either flag her down or just deal with our issues. A few of those issues included: Cold food (which I noticed was mentioned in other reviews so this Dennys must think it's acceptable), running out of our drinks and not having them refilled a single time during our meal, and having our order messed up. I wish I could blame this on the restaurant being understaffed or just extremely busy, but sadly it was just poor service."}
{"text":"I love this place. Excellent value for money. Great service. Wide range of selections. Lot's of them vegetarian. Plus, they have a 'fit fare' menu that's pretty delicious too. I would particularly recommend the Veggie Skillet. What I like the most about this place though is the fact that it's always open!! Literally always, 24*7 even on Thanksgiving, Christmas, New year's day."}
{"text":"Better to eat here and pay less than go to a cafe inside one of the casinos. I payed $5 more for a stack of pancakes, eggs, bacon and hash browns at a cafe in a casino than here at Denny's. Not only do you get larger portions at Denny's but depending on the time of day, I went at around 4am, you'll get better service here. Also their Alaskan salmon is very delicious. I ain't a picky eater but when I am in need of fish, I go here for that Alaskan salmon. Also Isabelle is a very nice server and she needs a raise ASAP."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this Denny's. They got my boyfriends order right, his being the chicken philly melt with seasoned fries, and a side of ranch. Mine, however, they completely screwed up. Over the phone, I ordered 2 pieces of French toast, with a side of cream cheese frosting (I only use that for French toast, not syrup) and a side of fresh strawberries. The lady even repeated CREAM CHEESE FROSTING and FRESH strawberries back to me over the phone to make sure she had the order correct. They said it would take 20-25 min. We got there 30 min later and had to wait another 5-10 for them to put the order together. When I checked the order there, they had given me these nasty soggy strawberries in juice and I told the lady that wasn't what I ordered, and all she said was they no longer sell fresh strawberries. I decided to deal with it, and when I got home I checked the order again, and yet again, something was wrong. My cream cheese frosting that I PAID FOR, was nowhere to be found. Instead, they had a small side of whipped cream, which, by now is melted... This is the 2nd time I've gone to a Denny's and been disappointed. My boyfriend and I were regulars up until now."}
{"text":"Super nice and friendly employees! Great food! My only complaint was the waitress didn't get us refills...."}
{"text":"It's was alright. Food came out pretty fast considering that it was the 5 of us. There was nothing that stood out to much, just a typical diner for the family."}
{"text":"I signed up for yelp just so I could leave this review.  This is the worst denny's i've ever been to.!service was poor and slow, and 4/7 of my groups orders were messed up in one way or another."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Dennis and I got to say that is worth going to another location just a few minutes away because this one was probably one of the worst experience I had in one of this restaurants. They took an hour to serve hour food, the waitress just keep saying \"sorry for the delay\" but we still did not get our food.After finishing it took her around 20 minutes to bring us our bill... it was just awful... the only reason why this place is not getting a one start is because the food was actually good. They need a whole new staff and management in that place."}
{"text":"I am very dissatisfied with the service we received at lunch today. Our waiter was rather sharp telling us he could count when we told him there would be seven in all. Then he said we had purposely asked for the wrong thing so we could have more sour cream   That was only two things out of several and I feel it was uncalled for. We don't want to go back  Since the bad time we had at Denny's they have gotten rid of that waiter and they did a remodel with wait staff that have been wonderful. Way to go Dennys"}
{"text":"Never have I had issues ordering off the kids menu until today. The manager argued with me about it. My daughter and I told him we are leaving so he said \" I will let you order this time\"  Don't do me any favors asshole. If Denny's is changing that then no more Denny's for me!"}
{"text":"When it's late at night and all the other eateries in Mississauga are closed, that is when we go to Denny's.  They've got good selection of breakfast items .. I just have a problem with the food being really greasy.  Hash browns are soooo good and pancakes taste delicious.  I've also tried some egg dishes and usually am not disappointed (except for the greasy part)."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, great pricing! (Waitress: Jesye sp?, was very accommodating and made our experience fun! She definitely gives you that 'Old School' diner feel! The others did as well.) Can't say this for all locations but this one definitely is friendly and eager to please, if you have an issue with your meal, say something; don't just chow it down and THEN complain about how nasty it was! (Uh Huh!) Let your server know, they seem open to correct the issue so you can enjoy your meal and over all experience.   FYI - Coffee here is topnotch!  Seriously;  hot, fresh, right brew, no sour, yum! So many places seem to get that part Wrong!! In my opinion.   Oh, the redesign as of June 2015, classy!  I definitely recommend going. I prefer this one over pancake cafe (which is very $$$ for less!), Perkins, and Copper Top (which I like too)  :)"}
{"text":"The host was awesome ! He's funny but pur server was quite anyways we ordered our food it wasn't even packed yet we waited 35 min !  When our food got here we were  disappointment  my plate the hearty breakfast skillet did not even come hot and it looked nothing like the picture I barely got any potatoes it did have flavor only wished I had more ."}
{"text":"Had a business B'fast yesterday. It was great. The place was clean bright and the staff pleasant. The food was plain but well-prepared and tasty. The T-bone steak and eggar was prepared properly, medium rare. Overall was a good experience."}
{"text":"We came here after the 4th of July so I expected it to be busy but we got seated relatively fast which was exciting. I was happy until we were ignored for 12minutes at our table. Nobody came to ask us what we would like to drink and the people around us were being served. Then the manager Brett came over and said it would be a minute but we are still waiting. When the waitress finally came over to ask for our drinks she was rude to my father and told him he would have to wait to order a milkshake because it would take to long for her to make it. Her name was Shelby. Finally after 15 minutes she brought us water and gave us an excuse for taking a long time. (She came back from break) When we finally got to ordering, they were out of seasoned fries. I was very disappointed with their customer service and the way they talked to us. We have been waiting for our food for more than 30 minutes and both tables next to us have been served. We were seated 30minutes before them. When our food arrived it looked horribly made. In addition to my fries being cold and inedible."}
{"text":"Beth was a GREAT server. We came in starving and assuming we'd wait atleast 30 min for our food and we got our food served in about 15 min. Very satisfied customer. Best Denny's I've been to."}
{"text":"I came back after the renovation, thinking they had improved. Atmosphere, furniture was an improvement. However after they took our order, it took them at least 30 min.to bring ut out, and our orders was not complete. Not coming back...."}
{"text":"Absolute worse service ever! Sat there for 15mins waiting on them to take our drink order. Food did not come out right and management didn't seem to care but would rather stand around talking instead of managing. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Went at midnight on a Friday this past weekend.  Service was rough, food was greasy and unprepared properly, and general cleanliness was just not there.  I've been to other Denny's that were great places, but this one doesn't make the cut."}
{"text":"First, I apologize for my friends...  I realize that absolutely nothing we ordered was on the menu (or probably on any menu anywhere) but i sincerely appreciate you making it anyways. The concotions that sound appealing after a night of drinking, blow, blackjack, and hookers are endless, and you my friends, are A-MAZING. I apologize that i used the menu as a pillow and threw that straw at that kid (why is there a kid at dennys on las vegas blvd at 4 am?!) but that burger you made me with the peanut butter, avocado, and salsa was spectacular. And my best friend really enjoyed the buscuit and gravy covered waffle and hashbrowns.   keep fighting the good fight."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend around 1AM .. The service was horrible. We waited for 45 to 50 minutes for our food. We ordered an original Grand Slam, pancake donuts, and a milkshake. They apparently forgot to make our orders. When we were going to pay, we asked the waitress if we can get a discount since we waited for almost an hour for our food, she said no. After paying for our food, we talked to the manager and she said that we were supposed to get a discount. She gave us a coupon instead. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Who closes for maintenance ?? It's Denny's now I'm hungry and mad ! it's supposed to be 24 hours"}
{"text":"It's Dennys....good service and decent food after a day of travel.  Had the 55+ omelet and husband had the quesadilla.  Finished it off by winning $7.50 off my $1....about paid for lunch."}
{"text":"This Denny's is hands down fantastic. The service was awesome, the staff was very personable, and the food was great. I went at about 11 pm and loved it!  They also give a military discount!"}
{"text":"Denny's is Denny but both times I have been here the service has been great! On time and quick"}
{"text":"We got seated right away , but had to wait about 10 min to get drunk orders.  Our server was nice , and patient .  My skillet was good and had flavor  , the pancakes were what I had a problem with."}
{"text":"We come here almost weekly after going out. The staff and management are so great. They are fun to talk with and always get us a nice hot meal and cup of coffee to wind down the evening.  They also put up with our shenanigans on the regular. I just recently found out that they provide their space for community organizers too. Thanks Denny's!"}
{"text":"Took a friend here for brunch to kill time before dropping her off to work and we received the best Customer Service from Aaron. He seated us with a genuine smile like all servers from most places. When he came back to take our orders we weren't really looking at the menu cuz instead we were just talking. Aaron just said politely that he'll come back when we are. So when we were finally ready to order, I ordered the sticky bun pancakes which were delicious! I didn't know it had pecans tho haha it's fine. Also I was just joking when I asked if they had rice to substitute my hashbrown. I wasn't really joking. Aaron says we have rice and nothing wrong with that (I think he only said that to make me feel better). My friend Nikki's order came with 2 drinks - a drink of ur choice and a coffee. I asked if he can make the coffee like a frappacino and he was more than willing to do that for me. To be honest I think we were giving Aaron a hard time but not intentionally sorry Aaron! He continued to smile everytime we called for him. I tipped him $10 and told him to take a selfie with us...of course!! Hands down we need more people like Aaron!!"}
{"text":"I bought lunch for my team mates and called for pick up order. They tell me 15 mins wait but ended more like a 40 min wait. As we sat down in the Conference room to eat one of the orders were missing bananas (banana cream pancake) I mean it is the main ingredient. So I called to inform them and they asked if I was returning back to pick up the bananas so then I asked if they were going to double it. The lady says she has to ask her Manager then I told her \"ya you do that since I have to return for my bananas.\" They also forgot tartar sauce for fish fry, ranch, ketchup and utensils..wth? We were already hangry from the start and then we go through this hassle. Although the Manager did ask me if it was enough bananas when I came back for it."}
{"text":"Terrible the waitress was screaming the food wasn't cooked properly everyone there seemed like they didn't care. The place needs to be condemned"}
{"text":"Still no difference from then and now. Service is still VERY slow. They need to hire more people! Quality people that is...or a new management!"}
{"text":"This was the nicest Denny's we've been to, remodeled and looked sharp. The staff and management were on top of everything from drinks to food service. We got our food in less than 5 minutes, which never happens during breakfast, hopefully all Denny's can follow suit to this, as it was a first."}
{"text":"Every time my husband, kids & I go to Cleveland to visit my husband's family we come here.  The food is great and service is wonderful."}
{"text":"We wanted breakfast for dinner so we decided to go again to Dennys because it's just around the corner from our home.  For my suprise a girl was cleaning the dusty window blinds I found so dirty on Friday. I ordered the same breakfast I had before and I was so happy to see it looked and tasted as good as the one I had before. My husband had the Human Torch Skillet and the Fantastic 4 Smoothie and he found it delicious.  The presence of the Manager is definitely showing because the place looks cleaner and the food presentation is much better. I'm upgrading them for now to 4 stars because of the window blind cleaning. For now I just hope they keep up the good work. Will check on them later on."}
{"text":"Sad to say that this used be a place were I could get a awesome chocolate shake. Unfortunately when my husband and I got here we have to wait forever to order and to get our drinks . In addition, we have to get to the cashier to get the check.  We could hear the people in the kitchen laughing and joking .meanwhile ,the place had dirty dishes and no one to check us out."}
{"text":"Where do u begin!  This place has horrible service and food.   Hands down the worse Dennys and worse breakfast food I have ever had.   First off,  we weren't greeted when  we came in.   We had to ask the girl If we needed to be seating.   Once we got to our table we waited 20mins til our server arrived.   She was very friendly so I felt optimistic.   But after 40mins waiting for food and asking multiple people what was going on with our food and no one knowing what was going on....  We finally got cold inedible breakfast.   It was to the point... I sent it back and didn't even want to eat there.   The manager came out... Not knowing which table was the one having the issue...  And apologized but didn't really do much for us.   It was the worst eating experience.   Wish we would of waiting for seating somewhere else."}
{"text":"Menu is upgraded,  remodeling has vastly improved the place. Parking is abundant,  and semis can park behind the adjacent McDonalds. A reasonable short walk takes you to Dennys.  Got the breakfast Grand Slam free, for my birthday. No, drinks aren't included,  but hey, be glad for the free meal! Most places just give dessert.   Food was fresh, cooked right. At 3pm it wasn't busy...3 other tables had diners. Wait time was reasonable for 1 cook and 1 waitress. Pancakes have that nice,  diner cooking flavor,  are light,  fluffy,  and big - come on their own plate.   Will be back for the new blackberry pancakes and  jalapeno- honey bacon! Or the blueberry pancake puppies."}
{"text":"I went to Denny's Craig and Tenaya tonight to get a salad.  It was 9:10 PM.  Two tables had people eating and I was only one in line.  The Host, or Manager, whatever he was, made me wait to be seated.  Apparently you have to be seated to order a to-go meal.  After 15 minutes of being ignored I went and sat at the counter.  Host or whoever still is ignoring me.  I had to get a menu from another server.  About 9:40 he decides to finally take my order.  I order a chicken ceasar's salad.  I finally get it at 10:05.  I've been there an hour now for a take-out salad.  Once I get my salad I go to the register to pay but the same idiot host is working the register.  I wait at the register for over 10 minutes and the guy is still ignoring me.  So I left the salad at the register and left.  I wish I could really say what I think of this guy on here!  DO NOT EAT HERE!  VERY VERY POOR SERVICE."}
{"text":"First and last time at this location, food was good, we were seated very fast but it was about 40 min waiting for the food at the table! It was 11am rush hrs so lots of hungry people...the worst part is the customer service, they look so annoyed and stressed to be there, my server brought me the food along with the Bill!!! Didn't even ask if I might want to add dessert,  never asked if all was Ok? Actually seamed bothered we asked for another entry!.... at the end the takeout box took her 15 minutes to get It! She said someone else was supposed to bring It?.. but she's assigned to our table?... anyway the food was Great!! But service horrible!"}
{"text":"If you have two hours to kill and feel like wasting it on hanging around for a plate of breakfast food to show up at your table, then Denny's in Champaign is the place for you.    If you fear or dislike attention, you will be very comfortable at this place.  The host will not make eye contact with you and will pretend not to hear you when you speak.  The servers tend to leave you for long stretches of time, so that could feel non-threatening to people who prefer to be unnoticed.    Most people are likely to be extremely annoyed by the glacial place of the service that yields lukewarm or cold plates of food that may have been good had you got it when it was fresh.  And to have it served to you by people who clearly view you as an intrusion on their day is probably not most people's cup of tea either."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Took an hour to get our food. The staff was eating and drinking milkshakes in the kitchen. Order was wrong, waitresses were unapologetic, card reader wasn't working. Awful experience. If you're looking for good food and decent service go anywhere but here. Drive down the street to ihop."}
{"text":"I understand there were a lot I mean alot of complaints about this location. However I was there only 1 time and didn't have a bad experience.  I think they need to revisit there staff and of course the management team.  We can not expect the best service when management is not doing there part."}
{"text":"I personally love this Denny's. The staff is super nice always there when you need it. My grandmother goes here all the time and never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"We stopped by at this Dennys on Las Vegas Blvd near Harrahs to have breakfast on Thurs 9/14. it was near our hotel and we were hungry and exhausted after a 6hr flight into vegas. there were about 20 customers waiting but the line moved surprisingly quickly. What made our experience memorable was our server, Michael D. who was courteous, fast, and the most efficient server I've seen in a long time. he handled multiple tables at the same time, all with the same care. it's employees like Michael that make me want to return. thanks to Michael for the great job."}
{"text":"The food was really good coffee was hot and the serve was amazing, so if you want a down to earth place to eat come on over to the Dennys on clairton Blvd."}
{"text":"We have eaten here more than 30 times over the past few years since it's close.  The service has gone downhill.  Even with the recent \"makeover\", they have messed up the order, after already taking almost 20 minutes to even wait on us.  We always try to give them the benefit of the doubt cuz the food is usually pretty good.  Biggest thing-- be prepared to more than likely be there for over an hour by the time everything is said and done. I'm sure it doesn't happen all the time... but has happen more than half the time with us. =("}
{"text":"I took my husband out to breakfast with my kids this morning. It started out fine, but it then took over 20 minutes to get our food. Everyone else's food came out fine, but my omelette was cold and the cheese inside was 2 pieces of two stale, unmelted pieces of Swiss and American. I showed the waitress the omelette and she just stared me in the face silently as if this kind of food was acceptable to eat. I asked her to take it back and she did. No apologies, no offer to remake it or to replace it with something else. The manager didn't even emerge to apologize. I wasn't expecting a free check, but an acknowledgement of wrong doing would've been the correct thing to do. Sadly, this is the second chance I've given this location. I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"After a long day we just wanted to eat.. I use Yelp before going anywhere.. I hesitated coming here due to the reviews but we had no choice.. Figured we'd try it out ourselves.. Safe to say, 5 stars for both the food & service.. We were seated less than 5mins upon arriving.. We're usuals at Denny's back home so we knew right away what drink & appetizers we wanted so we ordered as soon as we sat down.. Drinks & appetizers were delivered to use less than 8mins.. & our food came out shortly after.. After reading the reviews I inspected my food (lol).. No complaints here.. Everything was perfect! Kudos to our amazing server for the hospitality & fast service!  thanks David!"}
{"text":"I never order anything that has to come hot. Last week I was in there with my family. It wasn't busy at all. I ordered a avocado burger, my husband ordered a breakfast skillet and the kids ordered burgers from the kids menu. No joke, I saw my burger sit waiting to be picked up for 30 minutes! SERIOUSLY, if it comes out early, give it to me, don't bring it 30 minutes later super cold and gross. I refused to eat it or send it back. From now on I just order salads, you cant really jack up a salad, lol."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! My family and I were seated in an almost empty restaurant and we were never waited on. We sat for a total of 40 minutes and we were never acknowledged."}
{"text":"I used to rate them higher, but I am noticing very defined changes, ie Menu and tonight the Birthday program. They gave one meal to the Birthday Girl in this case, now its just a discount.  She expected her meal free, but only a discount.  Now on to the food, Person 1,The Santa Fe Skillet, I believe. She found it too spicy.  Person 2 $10.00 crave pan meal, with chicken had lots of Bacon. Really? If She wanted lots of Bacon she would have ordered a Bacon titled meal.   Person 3, Fries, these tasted better than previous times. Person 4 had a Caesar Salad, asked for Shrimp to be added but only the deep fried Shrimp so she passed on this. Her Salad was not as good as she expected either.  The Zesty Nachos eaten up by the others. its okay but a bit spicy.   Also expect Pork where ever they can throw it in.  All I can say is expect spicy to tastes, no birthday cake given to birthday girl or guy. I was not liking this place so my return will take a lot longer to return. This place needs to get better menu and promos.    This place is convenient in location by Deerfoot Meadows, but access can be a problem, requiring u-turn unless you enter through Sandman Inn."}
{"text":"We arrived around 4 ish and was greeted by Sarah. This was a Saturday, beautiful weather but windy.  She was best part of our visit. We ordered after being requested several times for an order?  This my spouse did not like.  She ordered Veggie Burger and did not receive the pickles which are part of the basic burger, nor the Barbecue Sauce which was part of toppings.   I needed to call the waitress over to request changes. She was given pickles in a bowl and Barbecue Sauce in another bowl.   My meal of Fish and Chips was great but short on veggies in side dish.  The pricing was in the $10.00 to $15.00 range each before extras.  It was very quiet in this store, compared to what I am used to in a Denny's.   Would I eat here again but I would also make sure the waitress understood everything before letting her place in order."}
{"text":"Wifi is back to broken. Don't stop here if you need to get any work done.  Otherwise nice place to grab a bite :)"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place after reading the reviews, but we enjoyed the food and the service. When we arrived the line was long but it moved SO fast! We got seated within 10 minutes. Our waitress took longer to get to our table and take our order, but she let us know that she would be right with us. It was packed in there, and she was swamped with tables.  Considering how many people were there, our order came up in no time. The food was great, REALLY TASTY! Silverware was clean, she refilled our waters for us when they were low. No complaints!  *we ate here for 5 days straight while in Vegas and Only had a bad experience on the last day, Friday. If you come here, ask to sit in Pamela's section. She's the best. Everyone else is really hit or miss."}
{"text":"The Waiter was pleasant. That does not justify that he brought me cold twice microwaved scrambled eggs. How do I know it was twice microwaved? Because how the cheese looked shiny and dark. Then to top it off cold bacon. He did bring me fresh cooked bacon. I didn't bother to ask for fresh eggs. I should have.  Lowest quality of all its food were the pancakes. Dull and cold. I will never go back to Denny's! The friend who I went to eat there with said \"tip the Waiter good, he has no fault in your food being bad.\" Are you kidding me? He had complete control whether to serve me the obviously poor quality food!"}
{"text":"Contrary to the other reviews, we had not one drop of alcohol in our system when we stopped by on a Thursday morning.  Normally, we're fans of the mom & pop's estabs, however giving that it was THANKSGIVING morning, choices were few and far between.  It was crazy packed in here, however we were seated quickly and at least 3 people greeted us when we stepped through the door.    I had the holiday slam with double bacon, well-done hash browns and the gingerbread french toast.  Why I ordered the GFT I don't know, because normally I don't dig gingerbread, however it was SUCH a sweet choice.  The HBs were perfect.  & one can't go wrong with bacon (let alone 2 helpings).   Our waitress was oh so cheerful even with 10 other tables in her section.  The manager stopped by each and every table to ask patrons how they were doing.  Wow, being friendly and welcoming!  What a novel idea!    Denny's on N. Scottsdale Rd, you get the 4th star for excelente service."}
{"text":"Please avoid this restaurant by all means in Chandler- Waitress is extremely rude and un professional...She fights with her manager, really lack inter person and people skill...  She make calls who to throw out of the restaurants..   I had no problem with any other Dennys in the country except this one!"}
{"text":"You've been to one, you've been to them all.  Which is why I probably don't visit Denny's more than once every 4-5 years.  On this occasion, my family and I were on vacation and headed toward Sedona, AZ, so we decided to stop at this Denny's for breakfast.  I had a waffle with some bacon, my wife got some oatmeal with some fruit, and our daughter had the requisite pancakes.  Overall, the food was okay-to-subpar.  My waffle was rather dense.  The bacon was the typical miniscule and fatty variety.  The pancakes were huge and tasted okay.  The price and the service were both just okay.  Overall, I was not swayed in any way to return to this Denny's or any other for at least another 4-5 years."}
{"text":"I ordered the T-bone and eggs. The food wasn't the best, especially hash browns and toast. The hash browns were extremely bland and a little burnt. Speaking of burnt, the toast was. One side was charred while the other was slightly burnt. As for the T-bone, i asked for medium and got well-cooked. It was dry but A1 sauce helped a little. The only safe thing was the eggs. But a little later I got a stomach ache. Although I wasn't happy  I gave a 2 star because I've had worse."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Placed an order, and 10 minutes later my meal was sitting under a heat lamp. 50 minutes later the rest of my tables order was ready and being brought out with my cold meal. If I could give no stars, I would."}
{"text":"They don't take orders over the phone after 10pm and they have an idiotic new employee who doesn't realize this until wasting 10 minutes on the phone with you while whistling into your ear!  I haven't tried the food, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for the managers. Jordan, our server, was extremely rude. I understand it's late, you're exhausted but that doesn't mean you can be straight up rude. I could sense some rudeness when we were trying to order our drinks and my mom couldn't decide. My mom apologized for taking long and Jordan just walked away. When it came time to order it was a nightmare. I was exhausted, hungry and the last thing I needed was to deal with a sassy server. We were trying to explain to her how my stepdad wanted his eggs and she said, in a rude manner, \"you either want it scrambled or over-hard!\" I was trying to explain that my stepdad likes his eggs extra extra cooked, she then proceeded to say \"it's called over-hard.\" Her whole attitude was such a turnoff. I'm the type of person to speak up so yes I'm that \"may I speak to the manager\" person. The managers, Staci & Moka, were extremely sweet. Moka was very understanding and empathized with us. She went above and beyond to make it right. She continued to check up on us and insisted I eat. I didn't even want to eat because Jordan's attitude made me want to just walk out and starve. Moka is an excellent manager. She is the reason I am giving this place 5 stars. Her & Staci were very sweet. Thank you Moka and Staci. God bless!"}
{"text":"Used to be a good place for simple food. But now they just can't seem to get it right. Wrong orders and cold food on a constant basis, this place sucks now."}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and the family was looking for a breakfast spot. We were told by a tourist guide that Denny's is a good spot for breakfast.  We get in the restaurant and it is very busy, people everywhere but we were sat promptly. When we get to the table nobody took our drinks for about 15 minutes as we sat there waiting - finally to no avail, our waitress showed up. She took our order politely and all, and brought us our drinks.   Food came out. Portions were big, eggs sucked. Pancakes were excellent and everything else was par. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"If you want a ton of cheap breakfast food, this is the place. I strongly recommend the waffles over the pancakes."}
{"text":"I want to comment on our server named Joe who works at this locarion. Joe was very upbeat,  polite and attentative;  a please to meet.   if I ever come back to this Denny's again, I hope Joe won't be there and has moved on to bigger and better things; he deserves more."}
{"text":"We came in at 7:30pm on Saturday July 22nd. The hostess took our name and said she just came onto her shift and was not sure what sections were seating etc. Not a problem we told her. Well the young lady, I think her name is Courtney- She seated us and after 20 mins and no once coming to take a drink order (yet servers were walking by us) or anything she popped her head over the partition  and asked how we were. I had asked if she would please send a server to take our drink order. She just took it upon herself and was our personal waitress. She was amazing. So sweet, perfect food order, drink order. She apologized if our glass was empty. Heck when no one else took care of us. She did. We had a nice dinner and it was all to her credit! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I went in to order breakfast. Dennys always good. The food came out fast and to order.  Very happy with meal. Not happy i had to wait 5 minutes to be seated.  I was only one waiting to be seated.  After finally getting seated i realized why it took soooo long. Their hostess who was on at 320 am was on her phone texting.  She was facing back by where the ice cream is kept. The 28 minutes i was there she sat only one other party.  Too busy on her phone costing the waiter and waitresses MONEY.  REVIEW your security footage.  Terminate her and replace her with someone else Whos willing to do their job...  Your waitresses are always freindly engaging and welcoming to have my business. I'll return but next time I'll just seat myself.  HAPPY MOTHERS DAY"}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean. At the time, there was no waiting . Restaurant was not busy. Our party of four order right when the server \"Alvard\" came to our table. She left without introducing herself  and didn't came to see if we needed refills we waited for 25 mins and had to ask three different people for our refills including the manager. The GM ( African American/ Jamaican with glasses) came to our table and apologize but even like that it took another person to come up and see if we needed refills like if we were lying and then our server appear. Then she left and it took another 30 mins for our party of 4 to get our food when it was not busy. To continue, the order was wrong since one of us had order red skin pot instead of hash brown and our plate had hash brown and One of the burgers had old lettuce and the cheese wasn't even melting. Our server asked if everything was ok and we ask for the hash brown which she reply \" they didn't had red skin pots so we put the hash brown\". Our total waiting before eating was about 50min- 1hr. At the time of payment there was another customer and when the customer left the manager said \"the cameras stopped me from violence\" in front of us and other people. The restaurant was clean but really bad service , this Denny's location really needs to review/ and go over things like this with the management team and the rest of the team also"}
{"text":"Everyone knows what Denny's is and Denny's is no 4 star establishment; however this Denny's gets 4 stars for a Denny's.  We stumbled in most of us drunk and obnoxious. We were seated quickly by the funniest hostess ever to work at a Denny's. She began telling us jokes that you can read in the other reviews. I mentioned we needed six jokes hoping we would each have one for our reviews.   \"Sex jokes or six jokes?\" She asked. \"Six jokes.\" \"Sex jokes?\" Six jokes...S-I-X.\" \"You don't spell sex with an I....must have been awhile eh sweetie?\"  Keep in mind this lady has to be around her 60s.  The service was enough to boost this place up but on top of it I was introduced to their buffalo chicken sandwich..and it is good. Seriously I swear.   It is still a Denny's though."}
{"text":"Good late night breakfast place for the area , like the steak and egg  and strawberry lemonade , waitresses been nice to me most of the time."}
{"text":"Late night dinner option at 1am after checking in to hotel. Staff was really great and polite. We ordered Moons over my Hammy and Santa Fe skillet, both were good. Over easy eggs were cooked too much and became hard eggs. Floors were dirty with food but didn't care too much. Don't look under your table, lol. I would come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Great food, fast & friendly service. Extremely clean restaurant that's been remodeled or brand new. I've been there several times over the past 2 months & always had a consistent, positive, experience.       I don't understand why such low stars for this location other than some people are never satisfied & or not enough people are writing reviews on good establishment chains. This Deny's location deserves 5 stars because they do it right & everybody should know the truth!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times & the food is ok.  I have only been at this particular location in Nevada & sometimes you get a really nice waiter or other times you get the ones who barely check on you.  So it all depends.  At least it's clean though.  There's a lot to choose from in their menu.  Not my absolute favorite place to eat but a good place for some cheat eats."}
{"text":"Here in Las Vegas to celebrate my 21st  birthday, and was actually excited to go to Denny's, I've pretty much never had a bad experience in the ones back home. Well this location doesn't deserve even a star. Me and my family got seated by 11:50, after a small wait time. There server was very polite and took our drink orders and everything seemed to be going well. But our server came back once after about 20 minutes of waiting, with water we didn't ask for. That should have been the first sign. In total it took us about 50 minutes to get our food, with a few mumbled  and insincere apologies about the wait time. The food took so long that my parents, who had an appointment that our server was well aware of, had to leave and we had to cancel their order To top it all of when we went to pay, already frustrated, the manager decided to \"check with the server\" to make sure we'rent trying to pull a fast one on him and his prestigious establishment when we told him that my parents orders were cancelled. The only person in the entire restaurant that I felt actually cared about my experience was the hostess, who could easily see my frustration and sincerely apologized.    Denny's isn't a five star restaurant, I know this and in know way do I expect the same kind of service. But this was easily one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a restaurant, and I don't think I'll be coming back whenever I'm back in town"}
{"text":"I have never even gotten food at the McDonalds drive through this fast. Waitress was very good, checked on me regularly. Food was good and hot( bacon was a little meh) that's ok though."}
{"text":"How the hell do I end up at a Denny's at 2:15 Sunday morning of Memorial Day weekend? Never mind that my out of town friends and I closed down Rosie McCaffrey's a little while before. I was driving home, thinking of sleep, but upon passing the intersection, one of my friends yelled out, \"Denny's! Man, I'm hungry!\"  Friend, I pretend I didn't hear you.  I wanted to keep on driving, but the yelling continued. \"Denny's! Come on! Denny's!\".   Um, yeah. And so, with extreme hesitation, I turned around, headed into the shopping plaza and pulled into a parking spot.  Upon entering, I already wanted to go home. Complete ghetto-tastic scene inside: girls at tables talkin' smack, guys at tables talkin' smack, random inebriated guy nodding over his chicken strips at one table, and an inviting color scheme of purple and ugly. There was a reason I haven't been to a Denny's in a decade. Were all Denny's like this when I was in high school and used to go every Friday night with my friends because we were stuck in loser suburbia with nothing else to do? Were my standards that low back then? Or had Denny's declined? Or do I now have a sophisticated pallette, as I'd like to believe? I have no idea.  The waiter, a nervous lookin' kid no older than 18, came to our table. My friend ordered Moons Over My Hammy or something similar. My other friend stuck with something healthier: a grilled cheese sandwich. I decided to get the club sandwich with fries, because a club sandwich with fries sounds like an extremely intelligent thing to eat at 2:30 in the morning. We also split the fried food sampler (aka. gourmet platter of cholesterol). You know, the one with the mozzarella sticks, onion rings, and chicken strips. You do realize that your cholesterol just shot up 30 points reading this.  And so we sat there at our booth. I'm fading fast in my seat. I want to sleep real bad, but instead I'm at Denny's, which I've begun figuring out which level of Dante's inferno it belongs to.   And then I wonder to myself: \"Who the hell goes to Denny's in the middle of the day?\" I've only been to Denny's past midnight my entire life, but I'm assuming these guys must have some way to stay in business.   The food. It arrives.  And it's as mediocre as I remembered, except for the fact that when I was 16 I thought all this food was pretty awesome (except that they no longer have the Dennyburger Combo - which I'd get with a salad and thousand island dressing and croutons - but I told you I had low standards at 16 already).   I don't want to eat any of my meal, but I pick at it and eat most of it anyway. Smack talkin' continues around us. \"In Too Deep\" by Phil Collins wafts from the soundsystem as if to tell us, \"You fucking ingrates should be in bed now.\" Nodding Over Chicken Strips Man has put his head down on his table. Looks like he's down for the count.   And I think of bed, so close, yet so far away.   But I still haven't paid. Eventually we find our waiter, who mysteriously disappeared for a rather long time, which is weird, because this is most likely the smallest Denny's I've ever been to. Where the hell was we hiding? Behind the deep fryer?  Anyway, we pay and make our way to leave. As we exit, more drunk people stagger in. And my stomach starts to act funny. Now, I know what you're thinking, but no, I was designated driver for the night so I wasn't wasted.   Although there lies the problem.   I just ate an entire meal and a half at Denny's in the middle of the night.   Sober.  God help me now."}
{"text":"Update: Just had a visit here. Service spot on. Not long of a wait and food taste and presentation stepped up. A good and promising sign. Will be back again to see if things really are better!  Older review: I don't know man. We got so excited when Denny's was opening up near our home. I've been there three times and every time was a horrible experience. Presentation of food has been awful at times. Had their steak which was like eating cardboard. One slice of toast buttered while the other is not.  Had a grilled skillet and the seasoning wasn't distributed properly so there were chunks of salt randomly throughout it. Etc. Etc. VERY slow service each time also. The same complaints are being echoed by friends and family that have been to this new location. I've also heard from people that have been there that the management is horrible and borderline abusive to their staff. Seems the problem with this location starts from the very top. Very disappointed. Will be going to my regular breakfast places in the area. This location is nothing compared to other Denny's locations. A shame because this one has such a beautiful modern design."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times and every time The food is greasy no matter what i order. All their beverages are watered down and their coffee is mediocre. Only decent thing about it is thats its 24/7. Service was ok. Prices meh.  Wont be visiting again."}
{"text":"Food was VERY GOOD, SERVICE was VERY BAD.  We had the new stick bun pancake breakfast. It was prepared perfectly and was very tasty with good size proportions. The service however was pretty bad. The waiter came to take our order and was so distracted paying attention to the conversation of a large family seated nearby that we had to give him the order several times before he got it right. He sent another girl with our drinks but didn't bother to tell her where they went so she started delivering them to the wrong table. We ordered coffee with cream but only a dish of flavored creamers came with the coffee. Finally the manager came along and got some regular cream for us. When the food came out it was the manager who delivered it to our table. Waiter never offered more coffee, just came along with the bill later. So if we decide to go back to Denny's for this excellent menu item again it will not be to this one."}
{"text":"Our waitress is very very sweet & we received our food hot and delicious!  The situation I'm observing however is a table of about 10 people absolutely heckling her! They are being completely ride. I'm understanding of anybody coming into a Denny's after 2 am is PROBABLY not sober, however, that is no reason to be complete A**Holes!!!  Tasha - your doing wonderful! Keep your chin up !"}
{"text":"Three stars given here because the staff did a great job with my party of eight but only giving two stars for cleanliness and the food.    Why is it that you can't go to a Denny's anywhere and not have some kind of problem either with the wait staff, hostess, cleanliness or food? I don't know why but I always walk in expecting something to go wrong.  That's horrible isn't it? You might wonder why I even go to Denny's? Well, let me answer that question... I usually patron Denny's for breakfast, usually while traveling, I love breakfast, and while I want my food fast, I don't like fast food restaurants, I like to sit and eat it and Denny's is usually the only and closest place we can find. Convenience.    Every Denny's I go to has dirty menus. Why is it so hard for the staff to wipe these plastic menus down? They're either sticky or have a hair in them or something and it's always my menu and no one else in my party. Grosses me out... immensely. The restroom was also filthy. Even most McDonalds can maintain their restrooms so I don't understand why it's so hard for Denny's.   As for the food, I kept my order simple with bacon, eggs and pancakes, and I was happy with my food but they didn't have all our orders out at the same time. Twice, on two separate visits to this location, someone in my party had to wait to get their food while the rest of us ate.  The chef also did not make some of the food correctly giving us runny scrambled eggs, lightly toasted bread that didn't appear it was even toasted, the steak wasn't made to order and they completely messed up my moms order but she was in a such a good mood, she wouldn't allow me to complain for her.   Anyway... Denny's, you guys really need to step your game up. Hire better cooks and train your staff to clean, clean, clean your Resturant! C'MON!"}
{"text":"The food was good for what it was, but it was pretty pricy for what it was too. We started off with the BUILD YOUR OWN SAMPLER appetizer, which came out so much smaller than we thought it would be. Menu pictures versus reality.  FOR HER: I had the GRAND SLAMWICH (two scrambled eggs, crumbled sausage, bacon, shaved ham & cheese on potato bread grilled with a maple spice spread), which was decent. Nothing special but no complaints either.  FOR HIM: My boyfriend had the HICKORY GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH (grilled chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese, crispy onion rings, hickory spread) -- which he described as \"extremely dry and lacking flavor.\"   Our waitress was also overwhelmed because she was the only one working, and it was difficult to get her attention just for refills. Overall, everything was average. The only benefit was it is open 24 hours... but next time we'll just go to IHOP."}
{"text":"Food is normal but my rating is for the poor service. I got here at 12:10 PM and the waitress took the order at 12:20 PM. I ordered an Omlette with hash browns and bacon strip. It took them 35 minutes to bring my order just to see they missed my bacon. Well we all work and have allocated lunch hours, I wasn't able to eat there, packed everything and came to pay the check ($11). I usually tip around $5 to the same waitress but given the poor service this time, I tipped her $2. I don't know if that made her mad, she delayed in giving my receipt back. She just left to kitchen saying someone else will come to give me the receipt. I waited for 3 minutes then another waitress saw me and came to give me the receipt which just needs to clipped from the credit card machine. This is the worst experience I ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner and were extremely happy with our service. The restaurant was a little on the slower side for 7 pm on a Saturday night. No wait. Staff was super attentive and the waitress had great knowledge of the menu and made some great recommendations. Food came out quickly and we asked for some special requests for our food and they nailed it. Would definitely recommend this location"}
{"text":"A centrally located store (a.k.a Jenny's / Gay Denny's). We've been eating here for decades. Nicely remodeled with Starbucks-style colors and treatments, comfortable booths. Evening meals 7pm, food quality has been good e.g. chicken breast is not dry and broccoli is cooked right not mushy / not crispy.  This time of day staff is trained, pleasant and ready to help. Almost always go home satisfied. For the frugal: Senior Dinner menu and Grand Slam Slugger on 2/4/6/8 menu, also AARP discount."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times the staff is great and friendly. The remodeling gives this place the old time at home dinner feeling. Love to meet here for business or just meeting friends. Wish the rest if them were like this one. Can't beat the speed of service any place in town. This location is one of the after bar stops and gets extremely busy after 1 am nightly. It is well worth th wait."}
{"text":"Great new building. Service has been ok. Hoping they get better as the staff learns the system."}
{"text":"Hey Amanda! I saw you rushing to come to work. Then work the room with a smile and coffee in hand. Thank you 5am is not an easy shift. Hope the rest of your shift went well!"}
{"text":"What a great value, with excellent service and great food. Very clean and clean bathrooms. We have been eating here for breakfast every morning with 2 for 1 blood Mary's for the past two years. Full bar and great building for a Dennys. Will do it again in December with my entire family"}
{"text":"Oh lordy, lordy...I knew I was taking a chance on this. I absolutely HATE \"chains,\" but I was on my way from  Clarement, CA to Breckenridge, CO for a skiing trip [2/2/08] and it seemed like the last place for an early lunch before heading across Nevada. [I would have done better with road-kill along the way!]  The service was wretched. The food was wretched. The ambiance was wretched. The cleanliness was wretched.  And there's a reason why I utilized the same predicate adjective for all of these qualities...get it?!  Are all Denny's like this?????? [I don't know!!]  Damn....Yelp won't let me give ZERO or MINUS stars...I'd choose MINUS FIVE!"}
{"text":"Went there this morning. Ordered the $4 biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns. There was a small black hair in my hash browns. Did not finish my food and left. Did not get it remade either. They did not charge me, that's why they got two stars."}
{"text":"Bad service, only one waitress serving 6 tables @ midnight...no matter the time...we should have good service to custumers. Our food took very long just to make and we didn't even order much!"}
{"text":"this place is a joke. I placed online order and told food will be ready in 20 min. I got there 30 min later expecting to get in and out but told to wait by the 1st waiter. waited 20 min, and still not ready yet. Asked different waiter again after another 10 min and still told to wait. after 40 min i asked again to a 3rd waiter and finally he checked and bring my order out. I was standing by the register and saw my order was ready by the kitchen counter since 15 min ago, but the 1st two waiter just didnt care to even check. dont do online order if you cant even handle it. the restaurant not even  crowded .. by the time i got home the food was already cold.. stay away from this place."}
{"text":"My partner and I had an issue at Denny's a little over two weeks ago where our server called us out of our names referring to our sexual orientation and Race and questions our citizenship and threw drinks and food at us and so I called corporate and they said they would be back in contact with my in 3-5 business days and they never called me and I've had to call them now three times but when I just talked to the supervisor she told me she was sorry that no one called me back but it's been sent to upper management and there was no reason for anyone to call me back which is a slap to the face and so I got mad and she said what do you want to make this right and I said you shouldn't be asking me what I want you should of called and been offering things and so I said I'll take matters into my own hands   This was the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant and will never be returning to this location ever again maybe any knowing now that if you have a issue at one of the locations corporate will DO NOTHING FOR YOU!!"}
{"text":"I came to Denny's with a few friends. Everything started nicely but my friend ordered a tea and it was just horrible, way over steeped. So then we ordered and I had my usual entree. My steak was stringy and way undercooked. Also we had to asked multiple times for refills and I had to ask for utensils. Stacy was trying her hardest in an understaffed restaurant that was busy but it everything seemed looked over.  We have a tradition of coming to Denny's but we will not be returning to this one. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Had their signature breakfast and it arrived cold, the scrambled eggs were clumpy and bland, the bacon way over cooked and the hash browns thrown on the plate   The plate was thrown together, not a care about presentation   At the end of it all for the cost you can go to many other places on the area for the money and have a much better breakfast   Don't think I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Amazing food ALWAYS !! and the service is quick and friendly, always a favourite for late night food seeing as theyre open 24h since it's inside a hotel"}
{"text":"Went there 11/28/13. Place only ¬º full. Seated right away, then.... We ordered our food. I ordered a Fit Fare skillet egg whites with spinach. The Mrs. Ordered a Cranberry salad. 30mins later... They bring out an Omelet that that we didn't order so it gets sent back. 10 mins later the Cranberry salad comes and all it has is lettuce and apple slices. It gets sent back. 5 mins later the skillet comes. 5 mins later server comes back and tells us they don't have the ingredients listed for a Cranberry salad. By then the Mrs and I decide just to share the skillet.  The check comes. Billing us for things we didn't order. Server says it will be corrected when we pay. Go to pay and no one knows what to do. Manager comes, we explain clearly what has taken place. The manager rings up new receipt for even more money then the skillet cost...I was not happy with this manager who obviously has limited skills in actually managing a Denny's. I've never had a bad experience at Denny's before and will at some point go to one again... But not this one."}
{"text":"horrific customer service. me and my mom were seated at a dirty table then our waiter ran off. then some other guy asked for our drinks and he wasn't even in uniform. there was also a lady dressed in sloppy casual lounging clothes serving people. it took our original server forever to come back and ask us for our order. there's barely anyone working in here. it's so unprofessional and the customer service is horrible. i will never go back to this place. save your money but the food was good"}
{"text":"Had the Build your own slam with the bread pudding french toast. Eat that last and it will feel like you're eating dessert. Excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been by this place many times and finally stopped one day. I had Breakfast on a Saturday morning. My server was Maxwell. He was adorable and very professional. I was happy I had gone in.Food is not the best but, it is very inexpensive, so no complaints here.  After such a great experience, I thought I would go back for lunch. Since this time it was a week day Maxwell was not working, so I was given another waiter. He tried, however yelling at me from across the room ,did I need anything else was not professional at all. I know he just did not know any better. Please do not discuss your personal lives at work where all the patrons can hear. It is bad Business. Perhaps Maxwell should be teaching the others how to behave when they are at work. I had gone in for a late lunch so there was only 3 other tables in here.  All the more reason not to put your business out on the street. I am sure I will be back. But, I am hoping to get Maxwell or someone similar next time. Bathroom is clean and lots of parking in the lot."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's I have ever been too!! My boyfriend and I literally got sat and we waiting almost 15 minutes until someone came to our table to take our order. And the lady that came to our table wasn't even the server for our table. Who ever runs that place better make sure their servers are paying attention to the customers walking in and out because the girl passed by several times and never bother to ask us for at least some drinks with the vegas heat we were dying!!! May I add it wasn't even busy. What kind of bs is that. I'm usually not one to complain about bad service but I saw a bunch of workers working there and it seemed like they were all just chit chatting amoung themselves while the customers just waiting for one of them to pass by."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and was surprised at the speed and service. I've been to plenty of Denny's and either the service sucks or they take a long time to take my order or bring the order. Today was not the case... Had the moons over my hammy which does not disappoint and also ordered Apple pie. Everything. Was good and the waiter did a great job checking on us. So far easiest going Denny's I've been to!"}
{"text":"Have been sitting here for 20 minutes and no service at all... Talked to the manager and he said we could leave if we wanted to... Total bs service here ...."}
{"text":"Bads: Slow.  Coffee not refilled at all quickly.  Goods: calories on all menu items, inexpensive, hostess friendly and welcoming.  Overall, I'll come again."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, I noticed the cookers and servers were dipping their fingers in people's foods before bringing them out to the floor. Not only did they do it to one customer's food, they did it to all their foods. So I rejected my food when it was served to my table. I asked if I can speak with a manager and they claimed that there is no working that shift. I told them that I would make a complaint and they didn't seem to hesitate to ask what was wrong. Couple weeks later, I came back to the same Denny's at a different time than last time. So this time, it was a whole different staff. I was seated and asked by the waitress what drink I want. I told her that I'd like to look over the menu and no drinks at this time. Little did she know, I was monitoring the staff. Not surprised at all, I noticed they were still touching people's food and dipping their fingers in people's coffee to check if it was still hot or not. Still disgusted, I got up and left. I put in a complaint and I hope that location gets shut down since they don't know how to keep their body parts to themselves. To think they go from wiping tables to putting their fingers in people's foods, that's just grouse."}
{"text":"went in around 9:30pm wasnt busy so my wife and i thought it was a great quick bite, boy where we wrong. we made our order and waited 25 min for it to all come out and when it did it was cold. meaning it sat, unnattended a good while. To top it off we got to watch garbage bags, full garbage bags being walked through the middle of the place. the manager comped my wifes meal but even at that i had a bad taste in my mouth. will not repeat. The only reason i can even give this location anything more than a 1 is because i still semi enjoyed my mildly cold meal."}
{"text":"They really should give you a coffee refill pot when you order coffee, to prevent this from happening again.  I give my waitress 5 stars.  She was very friendly.  However, she was taking another order at a table, and I just slammed my cup of coffee--not her fault.  A DIFFERENT waitress walked next to me, so I asked, \"Excuse me, may I please have a refill?\"  She said something like, 'Okay, but let me go to my tables first.'  I was shocked.  It would have taken two seconds to refill my coffee, it took LONGER for her to tell me that she needed to check her tables first.  Nobody in her section needed coffee anyway, and then she had to walk all the way back to me again.  I am a server myself, and I really didn't understand what that was all about.  When I am walking with a pitcher of water at my job, I fill up water as I go along, even if the tables aren't in my section.  It's about customer service first!  Anyway, my waitress was great!  She was very attentive and had a great personality.  My waitress and the restaurant itself gets five stars, though.  I've just never understood the \"my section first, you later\" kind of a mentality with refills.  A restaurant's staff is supposed to be a TEAM, not a competition."}
{"text":"The management is terrible! Our server was really polite and nice - he was doing a great job. However, his manager took him to the server area (right next to our table) and I watched as the FEMALE manager reached down at his groin, and proceeded to rip items out of his apron! How she doesn't get fired for that, who knows.  Then, the food - I ordered a T-Bone w/eggs over easy, and grits. I get a cold med-rare steak, and eggs that are way under done. The whites hadn't even set up. The grits were flavorless, and overcooked. I don't expect a lot from Denny's, but man, this was just bad.  Well, we get the check - and the Manager saw fit to take the table away from our server. I asked our server if he was going to get the tip, and he said \"No, she takes my tips all the time\". I know that every restaurant I've worked at, CC tips were calculated by who the server was on the table. Since the manager's name was on the ticket, I decided to give the server his tip in cash, directly to his hand.  I'll not be back to this location, ever."}
{"text":"Was very musty smelling waitress could have been a little nicer hubby had pancakes they were tough i had the bpurbon bacon burger way messy the bun disintegrate ed so much sauce couldnt really enjoy it taste was odd i would not return"}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast. As always - Denny's food is pretty good. What made this one better than others was the amazing service! Loved all the servers! Also, we did think it was way cool they had a full bar! We ordered mimosas and bloody Marys."}
{"text":"By far the best service so far in Las Vegas. Our server Raul took care of us. Also the manager was very nice and in control."}
{"text":"Went there twice, first it was late night friday and they served me quick and refilled my oj and sunday morning they were rushed but treated me with great service. I'd eat there again"}
{"text":"What did I expect from a $4 meal? I guess at least to be warm. I asked for the hash Browns to be crispy. But apparently that was too difficult. Place busy. Sat at counter, had to listen to servers and cooks fight over orders, just how I wanted to start my day. Not. No coffee refills offered..bill delivered  with food?  What if we wanted to order something else. We did flag over a random server to add on an item. All in all I can say I won't be back. IHOP pricier but worth it in the end!!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely busy but that's okay great service by Matthew very pleasant and did not crack under pressure he's definitely a keeper thank you"}
{"text":"Ok so I've been here 20 minutes. 10 minutes to get someone to seat me. 5 minutes waiting to order. Another 5 minutes since I got my coffee but can't stir in my cream and sugar because no silverware. So far Denny's sucks."}
{"text":"demora no atendimento. Apenas uma funcion√°ria estava empenhada em seu dia de trabalho. A refei√ß√£o foi saborosa, mas pelo servi√ßo , n√£o recomendo a experi√™ncia"}
{"text":"I struggled with the star rating for this Denny's.  The food was actually pretty good.  I had the chicken fried steak.  My friends had the typical big breakfasts and some hashes.  They all came out really good.  Not quite as good as the Hash House Go Go or whatever it is called.  But good.  For Denny's or I-Hop.  The wait was a bit long and it wasn't the cleanest place in the world.  Still, if you want a quick, cheap, pretty good breakfast and time to speak with friends, come here."}
{"text":"Always great service. The waitress Stacy is super friendly and kept our glasses full. Me it's all about the coffee.  I like the mild blend.  Very coupon friendly as a bonus."}
{"text":"The best double cheeseburger in town.  Quick service, love the game room for the kids!!  The best sweet raspberry tee in the business.  2nd best place to eat in C-U next to Alexanders Steak House.  Those that know me, know that means a lot.  Very family friendly and awesome food!!!  LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Came on tonight and upfront we were told by the manager that there was a backup in the kitchen and gave us an estimate time of 30 min.  Well it did take longer (thank God I brought cards to occupy our time) but I do have to say that our server, Oscar, was super nice and came by to check on us every so often when he wasn't trying to assist in the kitchen. We did get discount for our extra long wait and felt valued and appreciated the entire time.  As we were paying our bill, the manager expressed his apologies too.  Their smiles and appreciation made up for the delay.  I would eat here again :D"}
{"text":"This is a go to place for me when I'm not in the mood to experiment/ try something new. When I go here I know basically what I'm getting in terms of service and menu items. Not the best service by far but not the worst, not the best food by far but again not the worst. It's an average place for a quick bite to eat with mediocre everything. It's an over all comfortable place. A wake up and go no need to be fancy or even well dressed. Priced decent. Basically don't expect much just enough to satisfy your hunger even with a ton of kids!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous service ! No Hi hello to the customer . They just ignored.wait time? Don't ask more than 40 mins. Food been sitting there for 10 mins. No body wanted to hand that out to me. Never come back again:)"}
{"text":"I have been in Las Vegas since feb/27-Mar/3, every morning my husband & I walked to Denny's across from the Mirage hotel, the wait is very short which is good for the very busy customers they have to seat, the servers are great but the silverware & tables are dirty, we are there 3 days straight & it seems like every time I ordered tea my cups were dirty they even changed the cups I think they need a new dishwasher & more people to clean the tables I only noticed 2 guys cleaning tables after everyone was done but they were bringing them in faster than they could clean the tables"}
{"text":"Truly awful and disgusting. Service was terrible, the kitchen was chaotic, and to top it off, our food was cold. The cheese we ordered with our scrambled eggs was not melted. After looking over at the kitchen to see if our new food was almost done, our server, Carmen, came over and asked us if we were \"enjoying the show\". Our \"remade\" food was equally cold and inedible. Rude, messy, and bad food. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"The rude staff I have meet... First it took them a minutes to sit me and my son. After being seated.. My son and I waiting over 20 minutes NO DRINK NO SERVICE... The whole time I am just looking around eating to be service.. And NO THEY WAS NOT BUSINESS AT ALL! BS"}
{"text":"Decided to order online and pick up at the restaurant. Ordered the santa from skillet with special instructions for no mushrooms. When I arrived at 11:15 to pick up they couldn't find my order, took 10 minutes to find it and then when I got home the first thing I find is a good sized mushroom. I won't be ordering online again."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place my daughters burger was horribly greasy they  took way too long got season fries extra  charge  they were not good and very overpriced"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of weeks ago for lunch. I hadn't been to a Denny's in ages before coming here, but my friend's daughter wanted pancakes and we were looking for a place that served lunch and breakfast since we weren't going back to Flip's in Brampton after the last debacle.  My friend and I both ordered burgers and her daughter got the birthday pancakes (they were a limited promotion, so I'm not sure whether they're still on the menu). There was a bit of a wait to be seated, but it went fairly quickly. My friend's daughter was given crayons and a colouring booklet so that was definitely appreciated.  We were both really impressed with our burgers. They're made fresh in house. The buns are nice and soft. The meat was juicy. And the toppings were all flavourful and abundant. Their maple bacon (I think that's what it was) was absolutely delicious on the burgers. I think the fries are frozen ( I could be wrong), but they were fine and my friend's kid loved the fries more than the pancakes.   This is definitely a good dining option if you're dining with children because the options for kids are quite extensive and they really do try to make the dining experience pleasant and entertaining."}
{"text":"I really love Denny's. I don't thing a single item on the menu could pass as good, but I still love it.   The interior decor kinda sucks (same with the exterior), the service kind of sucks, and the food especially kind of sucks. With this said Denny's is still fantastic, now I'll tell you why.  The memories. Denny's (at least my location) is open really late, it might even be 24 Hour, I'm not sure.Every time I go (always after a night of drinking) something hilarious or strange happens on a visit to Denny's. In that state, the food is actually highly satisfying and desirable. Generous portions too (as if that matters).  Have a cup of coffee too. I love having a coffee in a proper cup, rather than a to go paper cup.   If it's late, and you just need some greasy recovery food, Denny's is your place."}
{"text":"Kind of gross--wiping menus and tables with same rag, dry, no water or product.  Syrup bottle top full of hair & lint stuck to it.  First time here, probably the last."}
{"text":"Ok if you're desperate for breakfast and air conditioning while Vegas sizzles 110 and you need to sit down.  I could not get a clean cup of coffee ~ eventually the waiter have me a styrene cup.  Also had to change the silverware.  But the food was good.  I recommend the light omelette."}
{"text":"This Denny's location is where you can find us on the weekend. Hubby and I share their banana-berry pancakes breakfast--he eats the eggs, hash brown and bacon and I the pancakes. Plenty for both of us and their coffee is also good. Super friendly personnel, so friendly that they remember what we want as soon as we take our pace at the table (granted, we always order the same)."}
{"text":"Love my grand slamwhich ..carefully inspected..Nope, no hair in my food yay!! That's always a plus for me. Seriously though, that sandwich is delicious. Mmm"}
{"text":"Kids were hungry for dinner and Denny's it was! However, the one on Clairton Blvd had temporarily shut down; so I made a left, left, right to get to this one. We had a waiter who was just \"meh\"..but our food was delish. The Grand Slamwich is always my favorite comfort food and it never disappoints. And let us not forget their delicious, mouth-watering milkshakes! Yum! (Three Stars because my son found a hair in his hash browns and didn't mention it until the end, so as not to gross us out)..bummer."}
{"text":"oh man i had to write a review because me and my friends always go here to sober up. and i mean ALWAYS! i love the breakfast combos and the milk shakes. i mean come on, its freaking denny's - what can you say :P"}
{"text":"Out for a friends birthday . Stopped at 245AM  and ordered breakfast to go. Waitress told my friend his birthday breakfast was free. New packaging kept food hot, even after 20 minute drive home. TONS of food, all just right.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Understaffed. Only server was talking to the cook while food was up. Not serving it, not seating is or 2 other guests. After asking 3 times to be seated or served I left.  Too bad, I've had good service there before."}
{"text":"Tonight, at about 7-8pm, I wanted a burger from Dennys; a Bourbon Bacon Burger to be specific.  I ordered take out, so I could eat at home.  Having had that burger before, I know that it can be a gooey, sloppy mess, unless I took precautions.    I called and was greeted by Gustavo.  I placed my \"special\" order.   I wanted mushrooms left out, and the fried onion/bell pepper mix, as well as the bourbon sauce, on the side.  That way, I could build the burger at home, and eliminate the soggy bun that would have certainly been there, if I had let them put it together in the restaurant. I know that seems simple enough, but trust me, most of the time they don't get it right.  I hate when that happens!  LOL TONIGHT was different.  Gustavo got everything right.  My salad was perfect, and the burger was hot, juicy, and all the goo-makers were in little containers on the side - EXACTLY like I wanted.   He gave me a time to pick up, and was was right in time.  That meant I got home with crispy fries, too! Thank you very much Gustavo!  Many before you have failed to get it right.  You not only got it PERFECT, you were really cheerful about doing it."}
{"text":"My friend was eating here with me and he found paper in his food and he thinks he'll get sick from eating \"paper\"!!! The waitress was really nice to take everything off the check and give us free food in the end."}
{"text":"Bleh, sorry Denny's but I'm not a fan. The food is awful. More times than not, so is the service. I only came here two times for breakfast because the other nearby restaurants had a wait and I was starving. But next time, I think I'd rather start gnawing on my own arm."}
{"text":"We decided to grab a quick meal before heading off to the nearby airport. But I felt the place wasn't the cleanliest and our waitress smelled of bad BO, that was very noticeable and distracting. We ordered some omelettes and hash browns and it was quite lacking in flavor. I know it's a chain, but I've seen much better."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast. The staff moves fast and it's very friendly. They keep my coffee cup full. The multipage menu has a wide variety of different kinds of food. It is so popular that there is frequently I wait to get a table."}
{"text":"We decided to bring our families to this location one evening. Expecting it to be somewhat pleasant, with it being the first time for some of us. We get to the front desk, inform them that we were a party of 10. Right away we were asked to \"move over to the side\" in a pretty rude tone. We did as told. Fortunately it wasn't long till we were seated. They weren't too busy. We all took our seats. I believe the manager was the one who took our drink orders. Later came our actual waiter, who was obviously not happy that she had to serve 10 paying customers. Keeping in mind that we were a party of 10, one person was doing the ordering in order to keep things simple. She had a very hard time keeping her focus on what was even being ordered. Through out our whole meal one person received a refill. We were rarely checked up on as far as food quality. Not nearly enough napkins were provided for the amount of people that were dining. I would not bring my family here again simply due to the fact that we did not feel welcome nor satisfied with the customer service."}
{"text":"Fantastic Denny's, employees treat you great, very attentive and te food is delicious"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at this Denny's.  I haven't been to a Denny's in years, but it seemed like a far better option than paying the ridiculous prices for food where I was staying (Wynn).  Being used to NYC, most places with high prices don't suprise me,but congrats to the Wynn for doing just that!  Anyway, after having not my best Poker session ever (meaning I lost quite a bit to a table full of grandmas), I needed some comfort food for a price I could afford with my now very small bankroll.    Denny's seemed perfect for just that.  It was about 3am so it was pretty empty, and the hostess and waiter were both very friendly.  The place was nice and clean inside.    Opening the menu filled me with joy.  Just seeing all the food I could order made me so happy, but also so confused.  What should i get? pancakes, appetizer sampler? omlette, sundae?  Then I saw it.  Grand Slam Burrito.  I read the description.  Buritto filled with eggs, cheese, bacon, sausage, pancakes, and syrup.  This makes the McGriddle look like babyfood.  I instantly was ecstatic at the thought of this meal.  I would guess it was the single most unhealthy thing I have ever eaten in my life.  Every bite was more perfect than the last one though.  This sandwich was so delicious.  In my opinion, this will be remembered as one of man's greatest creations of the decade.    I wish I could have been in the brainstorming session that resulted in this idea.  I'd like to buy those folks a drink.  You have to try this burrito.  Just wow!.  Oh, and the hash brown that came with it was good too.  Not a bad way to spend seven or eight bucks, especially in a town like Vegas."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on a Saturday. Everything was sticky; menu, booth, floors, table-yuck! Server was slack. Ordered mango lemonade and it was not mixed, son order same thing and got unsweetened lemon water-bizarre! I ordered skillet meal and it was crunchy and over cooked, server never refilled our drinks. Uncharacteristic service for a Dennys-will never visit this one again."}
{"text":"This place gave us a few horrible experiences after years of loyal service to them.   The new manager \"Allie\" was very rude and refused to honor a 20% coupon because we placed the order online then laughed at me for staying online waiting on hold for them to honor it.   This place has really gone downhill and changes managers like water.   The newest one \"Allie\" was just plain rude though and laughed at us for asking them to honor our 20% off, she must be the new GM though because the others weren't like that.   Avoid this place if you want to have a good dining experience. The to go food is cold and not the way you order it half the time and now they don't honor coupons"}
{"text":"I love Denny's but after eating here I think I have to stay away from Denny's from a while. The service was terrible and there's no nice way to put it. We were given a bad attitude as soon as we walked in the door....way to set the mood!  I was mostly displeased with the female security guard for being so rude and off. I don't know maybe the terrible service is due to the fact that we visited this place late night...but  that is no excuse to treat customers so horribly."}
{"text":"Very nice Dennys. Had the Sante Fe Skillet. The chorizo was very good. Some of the best i've tasted and I've tasted a lot. Probably deserves 5 stars compared to other restaraunts of this type. I will return there again."}
{"text":"We were three adults and a child who decided to have a quick dinner at Denny's. Had 50 minutes - a little rushed, but seemed doable. Mohammed, the manager, was at the register and took a while to complete a check-out, after which he took a phone call until finally \"welcoming\" us with a \"4?\" and \"do you need a kids' menu, how many?\" Neither welcoming nor particularly smart.  Waitress came over quickly, similar attitude - offered drinks and tried to sell us on appetizers. We told her we were in a time-crunch and asked if it was doable, to which we got a somewhat unclear answer. Waitress brought the drinks and we asked for a couple more minutes to decide.   That was the last we saw of her. She went to handle the register, then disappeared, reappeared and started serving tables, and checking on others. We tried to get her attention to no avail. One of us even went to the counter and asked if we could order, which was ignored.   We left - fuming. Told the manager on the way out that we wouldn't be back - he didn't even lift an eye. So glad this isn't our local Denny's - this was abysmal."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast last week.  Perhaps they read the other three reviews and learned from them because my experience was different.  The hostess seated me promptly and the waitress took my coffee order immediately.  I looked over the menu and as soon as I put it down, she came over for my order.  She was friendly and courteous.  I ordered their Red, White, and Blue special and it was quite good.  Everything was done as I requested.  My coffee cup was kept filled, too.  Someone may have pointed out to them the dissatisfaction of the other reviewers and changes were made or I may have just caught them on a good day.  Having three different people on three different dates all give negative reviews leads me to believe that I was just lucky.  I guess the best advice I can give is \"Caveat Emptor.\""}
{"text":"The food what's good and well priced. The wait time for the food was extremely long. The server appeared to have had a bad day and was not very friendly and was short with my wife"}
{"text":"The absolute worst Danny's restraunt within the area. The waitress was very unprofessional, she was defiantly unorganized within the serving business. Took us 10 minutes to get are drinks we ordered at that time. We waited 40 minutes and are food still never came out. We ended up asking for the manager so we can cancel are order and just pay for drinks. At least the manager gave us are drinks for free. Will not go back to this one. Save the time and money go up the road to Crackle Barrel."}
{"text":"I ordered to go and in the short time it took them to make the food I saw two huge ROACHES crawling around the restaurant. I told the owner and he said the crawl in from under the door. Wouldn't you think to fix the gap under the door then?? Gross! he swept them up and dumped them in the trash by the register and I'm sure they just crawled right out. I don't even want my food anymore. Also he tried to get one of the waiters to take my order and she clearly rolled her eyes as she was walking to the register which I think was highly unprofessional and rude. He told her it's fine I will do it and took my order. I came in as a regular customer no attitude or anything and left irritated and feeling like I need to take a shower. Never eating at another Denny's again!"}
{"text":"This has been my go to for a good breakfast for dinner.... until last night. First off I ordered ice tea, I got water, tasted terrible! Next I ordered create your own slam, eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast. I get eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, & pancakes. The sausage was very undercooked, couldn't eat it. I don't eat pancakes. My granddaughter had over cooked eggs & undercooked sausage. She couldn't eat most of her meal either. I'm not one to send my food back, I just do not return. Speaking to the manager was a joke."}
{"text":"We love this Denny's!!! The staff is always very friendly and always recognizes us, and we are always well taken care of. Gabriel and Mirlaine are the BEST SERVERS!!! They make great conversation, and they ALWAYS go above and beyond for their guests. They are the main reasons why we are regulars Here! We love coming in and feeling like family."}
{"text":"They sat us quickly.  The server was nice but they brought us a coffee cup with lipstick on it.  When they brought our order they forgot my side of fries and the cheddar mashed potatoes my girlfriend ordered were cold.  I usually love Denny's but this one needs to get it together."}
{"text":"When we came in it took 10 minutes before anyone greeted us. Once seated it was another 20 min before our server came to the table. We ordered and only 2 of the 6 meals were correct. Colleen was our rude server. She NEVER came to the table to refill drinks or coffee the whole time we were there. We waited 25 min after we finished eating and she never came with the check. We had to go to the register to get our check. This was the WORST Dennys I have ever been too. As an Ambassador Traveler and Lead reviewer on Travel Advisor I have thousand of followers / readers. I will also be posting this review on my travel blog."}
{"text":"Sat down here for a cup of coffee one morning at the bar. Had some good conversation with the waiting staff. Watched some T.V.  and did some reading. Very clean on the inside and out. The morning staff was friendly even to my grumpy morning self. I was left at about 9:30 on a Saturday and that's about the time the crowd started coming in.  I would go back here, it's a nice place to enjoy their coffee."}
{"text":"Best looking Denny's I've been to so far! I walked into a gem. I even noticed the manager wearing an apron and sweating in the back kitchen. It was nice to know that all the staff was working hard and sporting smiles on their faces.    After receiving my to go order...I noticed everything I asked was prepared in perfection. I'm actually here again today for the 10th time since my first visit. And again, the management is working hard with the team. It's refreshing to know good service and product is hand and hand here.  Thank you Denny's family and Matthew Chavez!"}
{"text":"Requesting a refund for this awful service. Ordered online delivery and was charge $10 just for the delivery alone and yet the desserts were not delivered and the veggies (old white dehydrated and hard) and the fruit cup (mushy and moldy) were inedible not to mention there was a total of 5 fries TOTAL in my fry order. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! I called the location from which i ordered and they refused to do anything to help me. They would not deliver the missing items nor would they refund my money for the missing items. They told me to call customer service but were unable to provide the phone number and i was told to look it up online myself. Surprise surprise I call customer service and they are not open on the weekends so I'm supposed to what not eat until tomorrow. I am sick and on bed rest and you offered a service that would have been helpful to my situation had your company actually been on top of it. I called the location back to let them know the call center was closed and they again refused to offer any help. Not providing services and product already paid for is stealing!"}
{"text":"Our price you cannot beat whereas would you go for 50% off appetizer after purchase of a drink at a local breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Tables are always dirty, slow service and people look like they came from the shelters. Most of the staff look like they've been eating all the leftovers geez get a freaking diet plan people. If you don't mind eating with the bunch of lowlifes then this is your place"}
{"text":"The service is pretty good and prompt.  The food is okay, nothing special.   Actually I really liked side bread...it was freshly baked and well presented.  Btw there was too many small flies near my table..I caught 5 of them but still annoyed my meal.  I am not sure and worried about restaurant cleanness."}
{"text":"02/13/2016- I had gone there for breakfast and was super close to were I was staying at. We only waited 10mins then was seated but getting to the table a tip was left from the last guest that was there. I noticed the seat was all torn up super ghetto! We waited 15mins before asking a different waiter to help us cause no one had taken our order. Not to mention it looked like no wiped the table down or put the condiments back in place. We ordered and getting the food was warm but not sizzling how the skillets are supposed to. All in this Denny's was the most disappointing one I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"This Denny's is pretty average. I am able to find some things that I enjoy eating here, so that is a plus.  One thing I didn't like however was that they would not take my expired coupon even though it was only a few days off. I have been to other Denny's that have taken expired coupons and many other restaurants will take expired coupons too, so I wasn't pleased with that. The service on the whole wasn't even that good.  Still, they are at least always open and offer relatively cheap food, so Denny's is passable as A-OK."}
{"text":"Terrible service! I give them no stars! Went there to claim our pancake from t-mobile Tuesday. Before ordering asked the worker if I was ordering from the correct address, advised \"yes\" so we ordered then came back after 40 mins. No pancake ready. The manager had no empathy and did not apologize at all. Their line to pay was ridiculous long!"}
{"text":"I've been eating there since it opened years ago and I must say I really do enjoy there food, it's fresh, hot and ready in less than 10 min. I recommend the Super Bird Sandwich It's delicious, Thin sliced turkey with bacon and Swiss cheese on butter toasted white bread. with french fry's and a side order of ranch dressing."}
{"text":"Just had a bad dining experience at Denny's nonetheless. It was my sister and me in the restaurant. Literally was just us two. We both ordered the premium pancake breakfast the dolce de leche cinnamon pancake breakfast and the salted caramel and banana cream pancake breakfast. The pictures make it look amazing and we were so excited to eat. My sister's been sick for 3 weeks and has been unable to eat and at 4:30 in the   morning she decided she was hungry. I was so excited she was going to eat I took her to Denny's, the closest breakfast spot. When we first got the food my pancakes looked delicious however it was missing the caramel sauce that it's supposed to come with on The Salted Caramel pancakes. It comes with a topping of shortbread cookies which were so hard I almost broke my tooth so I had to scoop that off which in turn took off all the cream that was spread on the pancakes so when that  was gone I basically was left with pancakes and caramel. So I did not eat the pancakes. My sister's pancakes looked nothing like the picture and was also missing the caramel sauce and the cinnamon crunch topping that it comes with. So she sent hers back and just asked to get the extra crunch topping on the side. She didn't want to be a pain ,she's a food server and knows how it is in the industry. So now we're settled and we're ready to eat our breakfast I'm still irritated for my pancakes but what are you going to do. We roll with it and  start eating our eggs and hash browns. To our surprise they all taste like jalapeno. As if we had ordered our food to be cooked with jalapenos. There was no way we could eat it. It tasted so much like they just put jalapenos in a pan and put our eggs and hash browns in there and was like here is a jalapeno breakfast. When we brought it up to our server / manager / only employee besides the cook that was there Yunior, he proceeded to tell us that we ate half of our breakfast and that the best he could do is 15% off and that was it. There was no  I'm really sorry about that or can I get you a new one or any customer service at all . So we didn't take the discount because it was insulting. Our bill came to $27.24 plus tip. We weren't looking for a discount we were looking to have it fixed. When you come to a restaurant and something is wrong, the customer isn't satisfied, I would think that the manager or the server or anyone that works there would want to fix it so they're guest is happy. So you get a better tip ,so you get repeat customers, so you don't get bad Yelp reviews. We will not be back to this Denny's.  I strongly suggest some customer service training. I am embarrassed for your company.  The first impression is the most important and that was an epic fail."}
{"text":"Live right down the street and I'm so glad! I come here just for the breakfast which never breaks my heart! Food is always great whomever is the cook for the night. This is the place I go to when I can't sleep. 10/10 would DEFINITELY recommend!  Edit: They just hired a new graveyard cook Gustavo? And my food came out AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Denny's I have been to! Excellent service and great food that was served quickly."}
{"text":"Thank you Chris for making our experience great!  We just left and dinner was quick, fresh and tasty but mostly the service was outstanding!  We have 2 young children and going out can be stressful but Chris made us feel welcome instead of feeling like a bother.  We will be going back to this Denny's for sure!"}
{"text":"We waited for an hour just to get our appetizer and another 30 minites for our FOOD!!!! Seriously!???? Seasoned fries were over cooked and way too crispy. Our pancakes were burnt and cheeseburgers had no flavor. NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Me my roommate walked in talk to a black girl about being seated. She then walked away to find something. Then another waitress came up and offered to help. I was explaining that the black lady was helping me. That is when another black lady that was costumer open up and said I should be nice about it. I explained to her that I am being nice to her wasn't being rude. That when the costumer said I being a racist pig. So me and my roommate was about to get seated when the manager came over and started at us. I explained to him I done nothing wrong  and he got all huffy and puffy and stated he wanted us to leave or he calling pd. I walked out but my roommate stayed in asking why we getting asked to leave. I then went in to get my roommate that's when the manager pushed my roommate and said leave again or he calling pd again."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's if you've been to one you've been to them all. The wait was low and the food was good   I had the prime rib Philly melt and really good it was stuffed so I did need to use a fork and knife.   Here's why I give this place five stars: our waiter was awesome. I don't remember his name but he did say he was from Guam and he was Filipino . My girlfriend is Filipino so they got along well. He talked to us without being super overbearing and he saw us dead tired so he offered to get us the coffee we'd ordered to go. That's attention to detail right there. He's a good guy and it's a good place.   Also food isn't \"the strip\" priced so it won't destroy your wallet."}
{"text":"One woman owns several Dennys  and although embarrassed not to recall her name I will never forget their kindness.My granddaughter Ella had a very rare Cancer at 18 months and Denny's was amazing to help fund raise for Ellas Tea Party.org They paid for table settings,name badges and in general raised a bunch of Childhood Cancer and helped spread awareness...a major sacrifice for a small business and for my grandaughter, one of only 7 to survive what she had."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome, even though she'd only been working there two weeks by the time she served us (yeah, we got to chatting). The interior of this old building recently went through a remodeling / upgrade and it shows.  And I really enjoyed the turkey and avocado sandwich on the $8 menu. The manager, on the other hand, could've been better. Here's the complaint letter I just sent to Denny's corporate.   \"My husband and I went to this Denny's on his birthday specifically to get his free meal sometime in the afternoon of August 17th (definitely after 3:00pm, maybe closer to 4:00) and we were charged for it anyway. When we pointed this out to our waitress (I don't recall her name, but she gave us very good service), she had to get her manager, a very thin black woman with glasses, to fix this. The manager took my husband's bank card, put the money back, but then proceeded to charge us for the same amount AGAIN, adding that we should've told the waitress upfront that it was George's birthday (?!?!).   We stepped out of the store, confused, looked at the receipt again, then went back in to talk to the manager again. My husband - a 911 operator, so he's always keeps cool when speaking to people no matter how unreasonable THEY are - explained to the manager once more that we were still being charged for his birthday meal. She told us again that it was our responsibility to tell the waitress it was his birthday.   There are two problems with her saying this - #1. We DID tell the waitress when we put in our order, even told her how we'd just come from the zoo down the street to that Denny's for his birthday outing and #2. If the manager was just going to leave the meal on our bill, then why did we have to stand there and wait while she put the money back on his card and then just charge us for the same amount again instead of giving us the expected discount?   I told the manager we did indeed tell the waitress about my husband's birthday, but I didn't add how offended I was that she assumed WE screwed up and told US off. She then said the waitress must've screwed up, but still refused to give my husband his refund, even though she clearly had the power to do so. We stood there plenty long enough (look at your security cameras) that she could've refunded us, wrote up a new bill minus the birthday meal and then charged us for the new total. I've no idea why she was so rude to us and refused to make this right, but my husband was NOT happy about this. We went there specifically for his free meal - which he proved he deserved by showing the waitress his driver's license - and the manager refused to give it to us.   Here's what I'd like to see happen -  #1. I want someone to speak to that manager about good customer service and how to fix things in the future. I didn't get her name, but she was a VERY thin black lady with glasses.   #2. Please send my husband a coupon for a free meal. It's the least he deserves for the frustration he was put through on his 47th birthday. His name is George (REDACTED) and his email is (REDACTED)  .   Thank you for your time and attention. And we will NOT be visiting that particular Denny's again anytime soon.\""}
{"text":"I should've heeded the 2.5 star warning. I call in a pick up order for a philly steak omelette sub pepper jack instead of swiss(twice) and ask to sub the hash brown and toast for avocado and bacon. Seems fairly reasonable to me.... Apparently the keto substitution wasn't possible and the shit costs me $16. I get back to the office to find out that \"pepper jack\" translates to \"no cheese\" in Denny's speak. Maybe they don't offer pepper jack but it would've been nice to be told that and replace it with cheddar. For what I paid the amount of steak was definitely lacking.  The cherry on top is 4 slices of bacon require their own giant to go box wasting unnecessary amounts of plastic... Going to Egg Works next time getting what I want, better quality, for less."}
{"text":"Service here was awful. No one was there to take our order we had to go to the front to ask for our server. Who dropped off our food an never came to check on us again. I had to go to the front to pay as she never dropped off our check. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"We're regulars at this location. Staff is fantastic and often have our drinks ready when we sit down. Orders are fast and accurate. Management is great too.  Food is typical diner food.  If you're bringing a large party for breakfast or lunch on the weekend though, prepare for a wait."}
{"text":"Been to ALOT of Denny's restaurants over the years, but NONE quite as unique, and eclectic as this one. There's an area where, if it so strikes you to do this, you can get married in front of a REALLY COOL picture of Elvis!! The restaurant sits in between a tattoo shop, some bars, and across the street from The Heart Attack Grill, where you can watch people weigh themselves before entering. The food is well, it's a Denny's, nothing to really rave about there, but they have an expansive beer menu to choose from, just in case getting intoxicated at a Denny's is your thing."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Went in for breakfast.  Drink order took fairly quickly.  Meal order fairly quickly then it all went downhill.  Saw tables already eating they finished up others were seated and their meals were coming out.  Our waitress kept looking at us and serving the newcomers.  I finally called her over after a half hour and asked where our food was.  She said she would check, ten minutes later she came back finally and said she had flipped her page and never placed our order.  We got up and left at this point.  I did ask to speak to the manager and he didn't seem to care how poor the service is.  MY ADVICE IF YOUR MEAL DOES NOT COME OUT IN 10 MINUTES CHECK ON IT OR LEAVE IT PROBABLY WON'T COME OUT."}
{"text":"This Denny's has something special, and that is Patty H. Her customer service is beyond that of any establishment . You always feel welcomed and like your family. The food is pretty good too. Thank you Patty for always making my dining experience special and something to brighten my day."}
{"text":"Value slam is a solid choice for breakfast.   Good luck to you though if you get a server named Nick at your table.  He took my order and then that was the last time he came to my table as another lady brought out my food and then when I walked up to the register to pay I did not even have a check so that lady also rang me out.  Nick also never came back to the table to check with me to see if the food was ok etc."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Denny's in Nevada. It claims to be 24 hrs however should you get hungry in the wee hours plan for a long wait to be served, poor customer service and horrible level of cleanliness. As we pulled around 2am to eat the waiter apparently had an errand to run despite the fact that we were walking in. We sat for 15 minutes in a desolate restaurant calling out to anyone for service with no response. There was an employee in the restaurant dressed in Black I assume to be the cook and despite our calls for recognition even he refused to respond and stayed in the back. Another group of customers arrived and waited the same. While there I took the opportunity to share photos of what the tables looked like at 2am with no one in the restaurant. It's obvious that the employees could care less about cleanliness or service. We decided to leave and spend our money across the street at IHOP which is also 24hrs. The service was great, the food was fresh and the restaurant was clean. It's been years since I stepped foot into a Denny's and I will Never again thanks to this horrific experience. Don't waste your time or your money!"}
{"text":"Now this is what I'm fucking talking about this is a real Denny's. I got the double cheeseburger and it was bigger than my dreams and goals in life. Chrystal the waitress was extremely friendly and funny. She a baddie."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Stopped in by myself mid morning for a quick breakfast.  The restaurant was not busy and the wait staff seemed to be on top of things.  I sat at the counter so had a good view of orders being entered, plated and the two cooks.  The kitchen was obviously understaffed and communication was a problem as I witnessed waiters often correcting the finished plates and plates being returned.  I saw a hamburger that was plated and ready for delivery and I timed it over 15 minutes before the cook prepared the rest of that table's order.  I expected the customer to send it back as \"cold\".   My senior meal of 1 waffle, 1 egg, 2 bacon took 25 minutes.  The Belgian waffle tasted as bland as any toaster waffle. Won't go back.  On a positive note. my waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"I always expect food at chains to be meh. But I had really good wraps ( looked more like tacos ;) ) here so I thought I would give them credit for it.   It was funny because I had my boyfriend try my Chipotle chicken wraps and he had entree envy right away.  They're called wraps but for $4 you get a plate with 2 stuffed chicken tacos,lettuce, cheese and drizzled Chipotle sauce + fries  :-D  Service was good and the restaurant was clean.  It gets a 4 because I'm automatically a fan of these small, inexpensive, and delicious meal"}
{"text":"This is the first Denny's i have bothered to try in Vegas. We came here 11/26/16 to finally try the new pancakes they've been advertising like crazy.There was plenty of parking and no wait to be seated, place was about half full. Restaurant was very clean and well staffed. Our waitress was Miriam, she was wonderful very attentive. We enjoyed the new fluffy pancakes, which i would put right up there with Dupars at a much better price. This will be our go to Dennys when in Vegas."}
{"text":"They didn't have a lot of the items on the menu and that made me not really wanna order?"}
{"text":"The family & I made a trip to Las Vegas last summer for a reunion.  Unfortunately it was a few weeks shy of my 21st birthday.  So, I was a little bummed because everyone knows that Vegas is no fun for anyone under 21.  When I wasn't at one of the many events for our family reunion, I spent most of my time in our hotel room.  Luckily, I wasn't alone...I had my brother & my 19 yr old cousin to keep me company.  One day after breakfast while my brother was at the gym, my cousin & I decided to  ditch the adults (not really) and go shopping on the strip.  For lunch, we came HERE.  I absolutely love Dennys!!  I have to say we were expecting it to be busy & service to be mediocre.  However, it was the total opposite.  It wasn't at all that busy & service was great! The workers were really nice.  Our waitress was especially nice...she enjoyed the fact that we were from Hawaii & asked us questions about it.  Lol.    The food was good too.  As it being Denny's, I feel no need to comment anymore on the food because in my opinion, it was the same as one would find at any other Denny's restaurant, in exception to a few items that we normally wouldn't find on the menu in Hawaii.  As for the atmosphere, it was nice...kinda loud because there happened to be lots of frat guys & a few family brunches happening when we got there.  But other than that, it almost didn't feel like we were in Vegas for a second...until we walked out the door into the heat and the Vegas commotion."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location for awhile since it is close to  our house, but the service continues to go down hill. We have found the wait staff to be very rude here, some of them barely smile, no personalities. This last time upset us because we sat down first before another table, yet they were waited on first got their drink orders, everything. The waitress did not even look at us, i literally turned and faced her to get her attention, i said we were first, we have been waiting for a while, its like you guys forgot about us? she proceeds to take our order does not apologize basically talks over me, wow so rude! guess she helped them first since they were hispanic like her and we are not! that was my impression noticed this here quite a bit lately. Not trying to make this an issue of race, however they were treated MUCH nicer, hi how are  all smiles, us not so much! so  she drops the check on the table does not even say thank you, just here you go, again no smile nothing. Hey guess what you work for tips! how about treating all the customers equally?"}
{"text":"Of the 5 times I've went here I've only had the privilege to eat here twice.  If you manage to get seated in this empty place then the food is ok.  If you go after 9pm chances are you'll stand at the counter for 10 minuets before anyone will even say be with you in a minute if they even do that. They didn't even do that 2 times, however, on Halloween they did say they'd be with us in a min after we stood there for 7 to 8 min. After 5 more minuets we left. They were doing nothing. I could see them standing there!  I don't know why the waitresses wouldn't seat me. My friend and I always tip well. That's like $10-11 extra an hour she could make on a non-alcoholic meal.  I wont be going back to this place. Id rather go to Vegas BLVD and pay the strip prices or the Ale house on Stephanie."}
{"text":"0 stars 6 Person walk out. Boss tried to buy us dinner.  Sat down, no drinks after like 20 min.   Giant huge waitress had like 5 tables come on. This seems to be a trend line in veges on eastern."}
{"text":"food came cold. redo was awful. cook slammed plates and acted an ass. manager suddenly lost all command of the english language when informed of poor food quality. never could eat my chicken freid steak.. gravy was weak. potates were bland. mac and cheese was really shells and white sauce..really icky. my freinds hashbrowns were literally dripping with grease and they brought her two types of eggs instead of eggs and sausage.. resteraunt looks clean and nice but even the ice tasted dirty and the soda was weak as well..  they were'nt busy at all either...not a good time! go to another location and save the hassle!"}
{"text":"Seriously, what is up with this place?  I visited here again with a group of friends yesterday (everyone wanted a Grand Slam), and was disappointed by the experience in general.  It started with the waitress at the front of the restaurant telling us to just go and find a table ourselves, and didn't get much better from there. I ordered the build-it-yourself Grand Slam, and it was very disappointing. A small scoop of eggs awkwardly thrown onto a plate, a couple of sausage links, weak-looking bacon and two pancakes. And they went $10.50 with tax for that? I make breakfasts with no thought or care put into it that look better than what they served me.  My friends weren't very impressed either, even though their meals (which were nearly the same price as mine) were stacked high with eggs. Sort your portion sizes out, please. It seems like no one in the back cares about what they're putting out.  The pancakes were admittedly good, but I've been to restaurants that give you just as big (if not bigger) pancakes for the same price, if not less. You're better off going down to one of the Sunlight Grill or Orchard locations for more food at the same price.  After this experience, I don't think I'll be back to this location.  EDIT: I also don't like the fact the waitress takes your credit card to process them if you're paying in that fashion. What, the chain can't spring for a wireless touch-payment system? Please fix this. I didn't have a problem with it last time because the meal itself was serviceable, but now I'm very leery about it."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a good meal here at Denny's. There were 4 in our party. The server kept our drinks full. The food was pretty good. I would say that this was a real value. The host was very warm and friendly. We had a nice view outside."}
{"text":"Went here on a very busy Sunday morning.  We did not have to wait long to be seated.  Our waitress was wonderful.  I had some kind of a skillet and it was very good.  I tried to eat it all bu failed."}
{"text":"So I'm a little upset that they wouldn't let me substitute my sausages for more hashbrowns. The lady (Brittany)who took my order told me I couldn't get hasbrowns only another type of meat, so I had to settle for bacon. So I'm just gonna have to go to a different Dennys, because they let me substitute sausages with hashbrowns."}
{"text":"The call in order service here is horrible. On thanksgiving morning I ordered my breakfast online I showed up 25 minutes after I ordered like my confirmation email told me too. They told me it's not quite ready yet then 20 minutes later after I had to complain about the wait they came back with the food with a smile on his face laughing and said \"wow it was sitting there the whole time\". Needless to say I will never do another call and order at Denny's again however for those who are going to eat there I will admit their food is good"}
{"text":"Breakfast food was cold and tasted old. Service was terrible. We won't be going there again for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Loved the buttermilk pancakes and service was good. Ordered the honey jalape√±o bacon and it was good but order it well done. Overall I will return."}
{"text":"I do not usually write reviews on Yelp!  As they don't offer an option for the offended to defend themselves so you can say whatever you want without any recourse.  But I had to write this review for a very helpful young man at Denny's  #8563 Boulder Highway.  When we 1st walked in a hispanic gentleman was waiting on us but could not speak english.  I asked for a Pumpkin Spice Coffee he gave me a day old coffee black.  A gentleman named Oscar came to the rescue, he was running the resturaunt it seems by himself.  We were very pleased with the service we recieved from him, or otherwise I would not be coming back.  I have been coming to this Denny's since I was child growing up in Vegas."}
{"text":"the best denny's in the area! staff is always friendly & quick----food always comes out hot & pretty fast. this is the only denny's i go to!"}
{"text":"So after a long, long time, I decided to give this Denny's a second chance. BAD IDEA! The is is THE WORST Denny's in Arizona, right across the highway from the worst Jimmy John's in Arizona.  The service is very bad and the food is inedible. Denny's should fire the manager of this location immediately and clean house. I love going to Denny's in Tempe and Scottsdale. Why does this location have to be so awful?"}
{"text":"what can I say it's Denny's the food is OK at best Mike shake was alright was to milky the salmon skillet was over cook dried  out restaurant  very clean Denny's is good for late night snacks and that's about it the high light was the server Nanette I think she explained what things were and drinks were always full"}
{"text":"this Denny's sucks at answering their phone tried calling in a order so I don't wait when I got there it wasn't that busy and I could not order at the counter I had to sit at the bar wait more time for the server to come take my order now I need to tip someone as I sat there the girl at the front just standing there as the phone rang never answer it done time some other person would answer and take the order will not ever come back to this Denny's again"}
{"text":"It's Denny's. What can I say? Typical American diner fare. Super bird, omelette, club sandwiches and pot roasts."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this establishment often. We never have a problem when we dine in, the waitresses are very nice I wish I could remember their names...there's a older lady with long blonde hair she mainly works over by the restrooms and their a younger lady with dark hair that's always in a bun on top of her head. They are your best waitresses. Now we never or dered take out. So we decided to try take out on a Sunday. December 18th to be exact. We ordered some food for about 4 to 5 people. My son came to retrieve our food and after waiting 30 mins they told him they gave away his food to another take out order. He had to wait again for the order to be cooked. Which took 20 mins he finally got the food took it home and the order was not exactly what we ordered. Which means we had to return with some of the orders to show them the mistakes. We finally got another order of food which was waiting at the front because the waitress put in another order. Which we took home as well.....we will only dine for now on...."}
{"text":"This location seems to be understaffed allot . This particular visit was on a late nite our server was karri  she done a pretty good job to be serving every table in there... must of had only one cook for add long as the food took. As usual food was up to Par just a tad worried about staffing . Night manager was in a rush  to go home not attentive to say the least  but she's in the parking lot smoking cigz..."}
{"text":"Kristen is my waitress, she's actually serving me now. Her service is extraordinary. Her personality is perfect for her position. I'm overhearing her talk to other tables, she is nothing short of great. I don't write reviews for everyone, not even good service, but great... Yep & my phone is dying. If you \"waste\" the last of you battery on a review, that must be serious. Thanks Kristen!"}

{"text":"Paula, the late nite shift waitress, was great! Food was yummy and the price is always right!! Thank you for being 24 hours!!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't review chains, because it defeats the purpose of the chain and also crowdsourced reviews.  A chain is a chain. But this Denny's is awesome.  The place was immaculate, the decor was hip and inviting, (I know what you're thinking... but this one is not your HoJo-style Dennys!) my server was super friendly (thanks Nidia!), and when I asked her after the meal where I could find a place on Fremont to sit down and churn out some work on my laptop for a few hours, she pointed over to the dining area.  Then she moved a table next to an outlet for me.  Customer service A++.  And the breakfast was good too.  Win."}
{"text":"I usually despise Denny's, only because the two in my hometown have just OKAY food, but terrible service. My review consists of both a drunken and sober visit to this place. ;)   Like any Vegas visitor, you drink, and then need to regenerate. I happened to see Denny's because I know the prices and I figured I couldn't go wrong. The second night in Vegas I walked on over from The Cosmopolitan (check out my review) and my party of three was immediately seated. It was probably like 3 AM though... So that explains it. The server was very nice and got our order quickly kept my coffee coming. I had the Super Bird, and boy was it delicious! The other two people in my party loved their food as well and said it was the best Denny's they've had (they eat it more than me.)  My second experience was on a late morning. This time there was only two people in my party and I was craving breakfast. Full restaurant, full waiting room, but only 10 min wait. SCORE!   But this experience wasn't as pleasant. I was the only person who ordered food. He forgot my coffee and silverware. So I received my breakfast with coffee and no silverware. Well now my food is getting cold and I had already poured some creamer in my coffee - what do I stir it with? I saw all the other servers running around and taking care of their customers and with coffee pots in their hands. Mine said, \"We ran out of coffee. I'm making some now.\" Translation: You're not my priority and I'm going to hang around in the back room. I say this because I saw all the other servers out and walking around and I saw him maybe three times while I sat there.   So I guess I should have known better, and I definitely learned my lesson. Would I say this place is hit or miss? Not necessarily. I should have just asked for a different server or waited to be seated somewhere else.   Other than the terrible service, the food was good. Whatever. It's Vegas!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service from our waiter. I ordered a cali club sandwich and tater tots. I got a sandwich with the avocado rotten and hash browns with chopped bacon on top. What gets me pissed off is that he assumed that is what I wanted and didn't even ask me if it was ok to give me hash brown instead of tater tots. Then when I get my bill i got charged for the tater tots. I told the waiter and he said it was still for the hash browns and cheese and bacon. I promise I will never be back here again."}
{"text":"I came here around 2am on a Saturday night, surprisingly there was quite a few people there at that hour. I got seated and orders taken pretty quickly, however when the food came out...it was the wrong order. It felt like I waited much longer for them to redo my order. The food was decent. I liked the pancakes but the scrambled eggs seem a bit on the dry side. The reason I'm giving this place a 3 star is because when the lady came back with the bill we said we were paying by card, she went to get it but 15-20mins later it clearly looked like she forgot. Ended up getting another person as she didn't bother to look out to the dining area.  Update: Been to this location about 3-4 times, and noticed that the servers use their bare hands to re-position the pancakes that come out from the kitchen."}
{"text":"patty melt was burnt rye bread was stale.food served cold.the Chili Cheese burger my friend ordered looked like someone threw up on it.very messy. their also were nats flying on the food..."}
{"text":"Ok (it's Midnight). This has got to be the most interesting food experience I've had in a long time. The staff was very friendly... then service went downhill from there. Apparently 2 servers called out so I get being short staffed. However, the orders took forever to come, they were incorrect and when sent back kept coming back incorrect.  For example I ordered the Apple Chicken Sausage and got pork links then got a pork sausage. There was one very happy, friendly guy bussing tables and refilling glasses - he needs to be the manager because he was on point. The waitress couldn't quite put the orders in the system, Clem to find out it was her first night. Guess they skip training and go straight to graveyard shift. The manager was trying to be kind of helpful by helping to serve but...serving the wrong food doesn't help much. Just when I thought things couldn't get worse a young lady comes in, in uniform, toting a 1 year old on her hip. She begins working - WITH THE BABY ON HER HIP THE WHOLE TIME. Serving. Taking orders. Cashing folks out. I was outdone!!  I commend her for coming because they were short handed but sometimes you have to say no when there's a baby involved. I'm sure this must be some think of health code violation or something. If you have time for comic relief, by all means, this is the place for you. If you're hungry, go home and cook it's faster."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Went there for some breakfast early afternoon and it wasn't too busy. They sat us and than sat a table after us. Our waiter Marcos then came over...didn't ask if we had any questions, just went straight into it \"do you want something to drink?\" Then left, brought our drinks out and asked if we were ready. We said yes and he took our food order, never asked anything except how we wanted our eggs cooked. As we sat waiting for our food we watched our waiter bring out food for the table that sat after us...which was confusing that they sat and ordered after us. About 5 mins later our food comes out and my plate has all sausage with my eggs, which was supposed to come with bacon and sausage. My boyfriends comes out with bacon and sausage. As he's asking who got the waffle, my boyfriend put his hand out to help grab it from him and says \"me\" the waiter ignores his gesture and places it down farthest away from my boyfriends reach. Our waiter Marcos then looks at us and says \"was it supposed to be all sausage?\" I replied \"no\" which was never asked to begin with. He then says \"oh! So it just needs to be switched around?!\" I said \"no\" he then says \"so I just need to get you bacon\" then brings me bacon that was clearly thrown in the fryer to get to me on the fly! Cause it sure was shriveled up and not crispy like my boyfriends flat grilled bacon. I then cut into my French toast and it was all under cooked. So undercooked I could taste the raw eggs in it. The waiter came once to ask if everything was ok really quick. Then as he's wandering around I hear his conversation with his co worker. She asked if he was ok and Marcos replied \"I'm ready to go!\" Obviously he was because it DEFINITELY showed in his lack of customer service! And co worker skills! A table in front of us had left money on the table. And he literally got all the way in the booth to reach and grab the money BUT didn't even grab a dish, cup or napkin to help clean...just left it all there for his co worker to clean up. As long as he got his money he didn't care. We then never saw him after that, so we got tired of waiting and just went to the front to pay and then he comes over with our check. The lady cashier was not so friendly herself...apparently she was ready to go too!! I guess when the manager lingers and doesn't seem to care about the customers and the poor service they're getting...why should the whole staff?? Definitely will NOT be going there again! And definitely NOT recommended!!! Save yourself from this shitty place!"}
{"text":"take my advice if you can eat somewhere else do service was slow brooklyn sphagetti and meatballs was a joke after 2 trys and a 40min wait i finally gave up and just ate the slop they put in front of me what a waste of time turn this into mcdonalds"}
{"text":"What an underrated place. While every other restaurants were slammed around here Denny's remained quiet. Not only that but the staff is immensely more friendly! This was actually the 3rd restaurant we tried to eat at and they were so pleasant! The food was delicious also. Also they are really clean. We left very full and very happy. Thank you."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again! Horrible service, dirty glasses, and uncooked food. Had to ask for napkins, more jelly, and butter. The place wasn't busy but regardless not an excuse for horrible service."}
{"text":"Lack of professionalism from staff and extremely slow service with less than mediocre food. This specific Denny's location is the absolute worst ran location I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I ended up with a blonde hair in my french fries..yuck!!!..it was from the cook..ruined my whole meal!!!!"}
{"text":"Got here at 9:00 for breakfast. Place was only at quarter capacity.  Heard waitresses apologizing for slow service. People were walking out.  So did we at 9:50 without any food. We received our coffee quickly but couldn't drink it because it was awful!"}
{"text":"Family of 11 best service and the waitress Berni was just excellent!!!! We were served like a super quick."}
{"text":"Just came in for dinner. The food was great and our waitress named Daysi was very polite and courteous. ps she deserves a raise."}
{"text":"So, I came to visit a friend in AZ, and decided to treat her and her bf to breakfast for their sweet hospitality, while I visited.  After a hike on the mountain we agreed on here.  Our server was sweet, and pleasant and attentive.  She got all our orders correct and was fast and efficient.  The restaurant was clean, the staff in the front upon entering could have been friendlier but what are you gonna do?!  Overrall, it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"Dude... it's Denny's. It's excellent drunk food, packed on Sunday mornings, not very good.. but not really bad either. It's Denny's. When you walk into a Denny's.. you know exactly what you're getting into. Why the heck are you even reading reviews about a Denny's? That's like looking for reviews on an ice cream truck, you're getting the same thing no matter which one you choose."}
{"text":"This place sucks manager refused to scan my coupon said i should've printed it  never got a refill on our tea. Only Denny's w no wifi. Service sucked!"}
{"text":"Server was nice , food wasn't good quality at all , waited far to long for our food ,didn't even receive our full order. Wasn't satisfied at all. Manager discounted the missing food , Could of got way better food from McDonald's. Definitely not worth $50."}
{"text":"Good food but poor service. Not sure what happened here. The place wasn't that crowded.  We went here because it's convenient to the airport, and we had checked out of the Bellagio, we also did Denny's again because we had such a good experience when we ate at another Dennys on Las Vegas BlVd. North not to far from the Stratosphere Casino, but started to worry we'd be late for our flight it took so long to get our food. We both ordered pancakes and when they came out there was no syrup and since no waitresses were anywhere, I had to get some from another table. On a rare occasion the waitress asked if I wanted more coffee and I said yes but she never came back. Ugh, the cashier was not friendly at all.   The food was great though. My wife ordered blackberry pancakes and the were huge blackberries, we both got big fluffy pancakes and the bacon and sausage we nice. Would have given 0 stars based on service but gave it 2 because the food was good."}
{"text":"It's Denny's so there is an expectation, but this was really good.   I was trying to waste time before a flight and decided to kill time at Denny's. The free internet access - as with most Denny's. I was seated near a outlet per my request. 4 hours of eggs, french toast (which was so good I ordered some to go) and hot tea went by without a hitch. Waitress was attentive and didn't bother me too much since she saw I was working.   Great place for a good meal and internet without spending too much money. :-)"}
{"text":"Went here while down in the fremont district of course and the food was good wait was bearable and service was excellent thanks to their manager on shift at the time"}
{"text":"I ate at the Buckeye Denny's and had like I always do, waffles and a couple of eggs n bacon.  The waffles were crunchy as always, everything good. This morning, I ate at the Tempe Denny's and the waffles were soft and crumbly, like they used the wrong batter. I also noticed that the syrup is not a high grade of maple syrup, it's a cheap brand. Things are changing with Dennys and not for the better. I guess you get what you pay for, but for $12 you should get a decent breakfast."}
{"text":"Whatever People say...I love there BREAKFAST!!! its all about quantity here and there menu is quite huge. The place is open 24 hours and serve American size portions of food. I been here quite a few time and the service is good and quite fast. You wont have to wait for your food that long.   I was there once for on a Sunday for breakfast and the waiting line was huge so prep up for that. The seating is quite old and unappealing. But the location is great as you can catch a movie in the theatres near by as well.  All in all you can expect Reasonable price and huge quantities of food."}
{"text":"Cute little out of the way spot. Retro building was delightful. Staff helpful amd friendly. They did forget the bacon on the slammin burger but our waitress caught it and brought it right out. Not busy at all. We got seated right away and our order was out to us quickly. Seasoned fries were perfect. Slammin burger was huge. Patty melt not on the menu here but they made it for me anyway! Thank you. Would definitely recommend if you are in the area. The outlet mall is right behind you so make a day of it."}
{"text":"This is the best Denny's I have ever been to. The restaurant has a really cool look and is nice and new (a lot in part to the previous occupant Elephant Bar). The giant fork out front really makes the building stand out (in a good way). A lot of unique seating options and very comfortable. Our waitress was very friendly and provided great service. Our lunch was really good. I highly suggest this location!"}
{"text":"Pleasant location. Peaceful and quiet, not very crowded (or at least at the time I went).   Clean, tasty pancakes.    My waitress was nice. Overall just a simple and pleasant experience.  I will definitely return in the near future."}
{"text":"Lukewarm pancakes when I asked for hot pancakes twice. The butter wouldn't even melt on my pancakes just to give an idea.  Latina waitress was not very friendly at all. The staff was panicking and rushing around like they had a full house of customers and it wasn't even that busy. My order took 15 minutes to arrive and I only ordered a short stack.   I will not be returning here, highly dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken sandwich that is my go-to dinner.  This time the term \"rubber chicken\" came to mind - a little crunchy and no flavor.  I wonder if they have changed vendors for their chicken ordering - it's BAD."}
{"text":"Either something is wrong with my taste buds or the food has no taste. I'm going with the latter. 1 star for the overall appearance of the restaurant. 1 star for the parking lot (it is big) well the rest you will figure it out on your visit as you will read this review and visit anyway. If the food tasted the way it looked on the plate it would have been great. If the server smiles and come and take your order, check up on you in an almost empty restaurant it would be great. If the cook would put a hint of salt on something it would be great. The restrooms were clean (already gave it credit in my overall appearance rating). I have not been to a Denny's in about 5/6 years and based on the fact they still serve continental tasting breakfast I will see them in another 2,190 days. I only went here because I'm staying at the hotel right next door. I will review the hotel in a separate review but can tell you they must both swiped right (perfect match). Just a thought, how do you burn coffee? Just for clarification in no way am I insulting the continental breakfast served at Holiday Inn Express (it taste much better). If you only eat 1 or 2 bites of your food, why would you ask HOW WAS EVERYTHING when I asked for my check? 3 stars automatically reduced for not using common sense."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's....is there anyone out there that hasn't been to one?  Being from New Jersey, the diner capital of the  world, I guess I am a little biased because back there they offer alot more home cooking faves.  The staff was great and the food hot....coffee was good as well!"}
{"text":"Just left this place and I would not give it a second look if I were in the area.  It was fairly steady busy but nothing overwhelming...i was sat almost immediately and was served my coffee, Kelly G. was my server and promptly took my order, that was the extent of her availability.  I was holding an empty coffee cup more than I was drinking it.  I noticed the manager eyeing me a few times and he even offered once to refill.  He was also the one to bring my order to me, Kelly never once checked on me to see how things were.  I got up and got my own condiments from table next to me.  When it came time to check out I searched for the manager to leave him the tip but he was nowhere to be seen...care to guess what Kelly got?  BTW I had the chicken fried steak and it was riddled with gristle and I ALWAYS order my potatoes burnt and the too was a LITTLE crisp but the inside was actually cold."}
{"text":"The secirity guard greets you at the door,  while the hostess slowly walks up. The witness is sooooooo slow I wanted to leave but the rest of my group was so drunk they couldn't. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Shameful me, eating breakfast at Denny's.  Whatever, you know how it is.  If you've been to Vegas, all your inhibitions regarding powdered scrambled eggs, icky little sausages that resemble my dog Rocky's terdlets, bacon that's as crisp as a puddle of hot melted grease, \"toast\" that isn't very toasty, pancakes with a pat of butter the size of a softball, and watery coffee.  Oh, and a side of orange juice, because I'm \"health conscious\" this month.  \"But three stars, Randy?\" you ask, incredulous.  Yes my dears.  All that shitty food was served within THREE MINUTES, and I wanted it there in two.  And, I'm a softie for waitresses that call me honey.  Besides, just look at the plethora of dickheads and nasty bitches these waitstaff have to put up with.  They do it well.  Nice thick (leathery, even) skin becomes a Denny's waitress.  You go, girls!!!  And...by the by....if you don't already know it, listen to Combustible Edison's \"Breakfast at Denny's\", on the album \"I, Swinger\".  Pure genius."}
{"text":"Not even worth the star. How is this place still open!?!? My husband, baby and I went for a quick dinner and waited till the 3 women upfront where done having their conversation before we where acknowledged and seated. We where the ONLY customers in the whole restaurant with 5 employees present. We first ordered for our baby mac and cheese with a side of corn. That came out quickly, after some time my husband and we ordered eggs in a basket no bacon for mine subtitiute with a side salad, he wanted to add a side of sausage gravy. Nothing too crazy and complicated.....right? Salad came out quickly but the lettuce was visably old, wilted and parts where very brown. We watched and waited and we watched and waited some more.......and then we watched and waited... 2 ppl in the kitchen and no food. At this point we are getting upset. We had been waiting well over 15 mins for what?? The place wasn't busy, we where the only customers there!  After waiting more than enough time we got up and went to the register visably upset and asked to pay for what was eaten. Nobody came to the register.  Just then the food we ordered came to the window and the waitress who was standing right infront of the window pointed out that the food was ready. Well we can see that....we've only been waiting for it. We declined and said we just wanted to pay for what we ate and leave. I explained that it's ridiculous to have to  wait that long when we are the only customers there, it's not like they where busy or understaffed. Everyone was too busy talking and doing sidework. I've worked as a server for many years, and as a prep cook, I'm not ignorant to what goes on and timing of different foods. After speaking to the waitress she went to ring us out for the total bill. Ummm wtf!??! GTFO are you serious!?! We told her we where NOT paying the whole bill, only what we ate. She said ok let me get my manager. She asked for the manager who replied, wait a minute as she was too busy still in the kitchen packing the food into ToGo containers and cleaning up to be bothered to attend to us. She eventually made her way out and didn't offer an apology but didn't argue either and proceeded to fix the bill. Discraceful. Shame on you. We did leave a tip for what would be appropriate for what the bill would have been for the waitress because it wasn't her fault that the people in the kitchen where incompetent. Won't be back there just not worth it."}
{"text":"I give this Denny's 5 stars because it has always been there for me when I take my RV to the mechanic shop. It's just a short walk from the shop to getting some good food in my belly. I have been here a handful of times over the past 6 months and there are a couple things I've noticed. The staff works really hard, especially today we walked in and the place was packed. The staff handled it without any problems. Then the manager showed up, this skinny bald headed dude who's position of power has clearly gone to his head. I've seen this guy a few times when I've been here, and the only thing I've noticed about him is that he will walk in and the first thing he does is start complaining to the staff about everything. Like treat your staff with some respect. You didn't see what they had to deal with before you got to work so don't just come in complaining and trying to find things to get angry about. That's the stuff as a customer I notice. You have an amazing staff but you don't show no appreciation for the work they do. Just complain, complain, complain. I wouldn't want to work here just because of the manager. I don't need to get told what to do by a $12 an hr used to be waiter spent 15 years working his way up manager who took the position of power and let it go to his head."}
{"text":"If you genuinely like any Denny's, you should probably stop visiting/reviewing Yelp."}
{"text":"Great customer service, but I could have lived without the long black hair in my scrambled eggs, DISGUSTING... The server and manager did a great job with handling the matter. I will not be returning..."}
{"text":"For some reason, the server did not want to bring three of the drink orders.  Then they only delivered four of the six food orders.  Two of us (myself included) went hungry because we had an event to get to.  Don't go here"}
{"text":"This is my husband and myself favorite spot We are here usually on a weekend Morning for breakfast. We always get exceptional service, we feel like family. ( They actually know us there and we get treated very well.) I have always been satisfied with my order. My husband also has been happy with his food and he can be quite fussy."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's like 12:40 am and Collin and I hadn't eaten dinner.  I offered to take him to Denny's on West Lake Mead and Tenaya.  First there was a crazy driver speeding through the parking lot who almost hit our car, we parked took a deep breath and went inside looking forward to a cool drink.  We stood at the counter waiting for at least 4 minutes while the servers were running around taking more orders for all u can eat pancakes, all while seeing us waiting patiently.  Finally, he seats us, right next to the kitchen w/sticky menus.  Then ignores us for at least 10 minutes.  I asked for a drink, more people came in he had to seat them.  We got up and LEFT and we USED to go there a lot!"}
{"text":"Poor manager let other server go home and then it was kind of non stop busy.  He (Fernandez) handled a stressful situation like a pro and still provided good customer service.  Restaurant looks like it's going down tho."}
{"text":"Clean inside and out. Food was very yummy and to order. Service was a bit slow but they were clearly under-staffed. Manager came over to apologize but is was all good."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast. It was early and not busy.  Service was fast and the coffee was good. Breakfast of eggs and bacon with toast. Pretty standard Denny's flavor.  Eggs were cooked to order and the toast has copious amount of butter.  They offer grits so I tried them.  No butter with them. Must has used all the butter on the toast ;)"}
{"text":"Beyond words how disappointing this was. We used to come frequently. Last time we came here there was a 45 minute wait because \"everyone sent their food back.\"  We left. Now I see why. Horrible. SO sad. Kids portions?! You want me to pay $5 for this?!   Old spaghetti and old Mac n cheese?! My burger was so dry and very few fries compared to 6 months ago.   Last time we come here"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened. I ordered the \"build you own\" which was eggs, sausages, hash brown and pancakes. I honestly believe this location is the best one out of all the Denny's I've been to. It's very clean and the staff are super friendly. The manager went around asking the customers how they were doing. His name was Mack. He was friendly and very welcoming. The staff are also nice and they all work together as a team. The food was well cooked and tasted fresh. I really like this location and hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"Great service here!  Someone was choking and the waitress did the hiemlich and saved the custimer.  I can't remember what I ate but I do remember the waitress and her quick actions."}
{"text":"We went to Denny's after we worked out. The coffee hit the spot. This place is a good place to go for just a simple breakfast and some good coffee.  We got the grand slam slugger and the bacon was cooked perfectly!!"}
{"text":"this dennys is the best the food is great the employees are great there is a im not gonna say gentlemen that post bad reviews every where he goes he abuses waitress and very mean every review he has made is a crock  h.h is his name and he needs to be exposed iwe were sitting in a booth when he arrived at dennys it was only 5minutes before he started yelling the customers next to us had to get up and tell him he needs to go  so h.h you are a loser and a very terrible person  get your mind right guy or get profesdional help"}
{"text":"I came here because I had a 20% off coupon. The staff was all really nice but the food just wasn't that great. I assume that it would be close to IHOP food but I've always given IHOP five stars. I asked for everything dry and not greasy and everything pretty much came greasy. Kitchen communications."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on a Saturday morning. Place was busy but we were seated right away.  Average wait time on food.  Our server Cassandra was busy but friendly and attentive.   Ordered the lumberjack slam........was ok.  Bacon was crisp and dry.  Pancakes were fluffy and the scrambled eggs were ok.   As earlier posters have said, I remembered Dennys from my college years so when I wanted quick, inexpensive fill-me up food.........I came here."}
{"text":"Not so sure why this place only has 3 stars because it really deserves more!   If you're hoping to refill your stomach for cheap before hitting the strip again, Denny's is the place to go!  The customer service here is outstanding! My waitress was super polite and friendly, then cashier was cracking jokes, and one of the managers came up personally to make sure everyone is having a good time.   The food was actually much better than I expected to be. I had a bourbon bacon burger and it was absolutely delicious. It was super juicy and flavorful. I think I could've definitely went for a second.   Side note: flavored fries over original fries"}
{"text":"Came in today around 11am with a buddy. Fairly busy, Sunday morning after church. Waited about 10 minutes, no big deal. Was seated and waited for 10 or so minutes until the man who seated us asked if we had been taken care of. He ended up bringing  us water and taking our order. Nobody else came to our table. We sat and waited and waited.... Left at 12:30 without being checked on again. I get being a little bit busy, but a little bit of customer service goes a long ways.   Cody"}
{"text":"Great customer service here. Pretty much great everything here. The place is located on Las Vegas Blvd just a little south of the Stratosphere Casino. We ate here New Year's Eve morning. Didn't eat at our hotel the Bellagio because breakfast for 2 would be around $70. Here is was $22. And it's really hard to screw up eggs and pancakes. I will pay $75 dollars for a great steak but and egg is an egg is an egg and not willing to pay a lot.   The service here was amazing, the coffee was continually topped off. Anytime a waiter or waitress came by they asked is we needed anything, the manager came by and asked how we were doing. The place was very clean and nice and the food came out quickly and was hot, fresh and tasty. Wife had blueberry pancakes and I had Moons over Myhammy lol great name. Eggs cooked just right the toast nice and crisp not moist, bacon full of flavor and crisp and the pancakes covered with large tasty blueberries.   Not sure why, but there are a million Denny's in Las Vegas. But even if you have to go a little ways, I would pay this one a visit."}
{"text":"I had to write a review because I don't think this location deserves the 2-star avg that it currently stands at.  Memei has solely managed to lower my review down 2 whole stars that I would have given for my previous 8 visits.  Based on all previous visits, this location would have gotten 3 stars.  We normally stay at Days Inn for business twice a year and they give vouchers for free breakfast from 5-12 every day that you are there.  Food is good, but a little slow.  Thats understood being that our tab is obviously on the lower end, and they do get the occasional paying customer.  I have to give credit to CC.  She was sweet & can probably teach Memei what customer service really is.  Memei should really stop yelling back at customers and her manager.  Im not sure she was the right pick to be hostess that day... or EVER.  She needs to stop tossing dirty utensils on empty tables.  Maybe someone can tell her that no one is forcing her to work there..."}
{"text":"Waitress had no idea what was on the menu, wasn't upbeat and just seemed sour. Took 10 minutes to get out water after we sat down and almost every chair we wanted to sit on was LOADED with leftover crumbs and whatnot for the previous party. Pretty pathetic. Sad because 3 months ago we had the same experience. AL ost as if they don't give a single shit about customer service"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I ordered online and came at 8:30 when it said the food would be ready. Ended up waiting till 9:32 to get my food. There was a very rude lady there that told me I should've told her that I was waiting for my food when that's exactly what I did when I came in. While waiting for an hour I watched at least 4 groups of people who left cause they waiting over 10 mins for someone to even try to seat them. When I got home my food was cold and the cheese was not even a little melted."}
{"text":"No Star! Great customer service latrish/katrish la shit whatever your name was manager! Time 8pm on 2/20/2018  Put in for two separate to go out orders. Hubby's was done but mine they couldn't see weird since I only put it in 3 mins after his and I gave them well over 30 mins from the 20 they quote for ready for pick up. Still took another 20 to get all together 50min total not 20.  Anyways finally get my order get home to see that my food is not cooked to order so I still had to finish cooking it at home and my order was incomplete. I call them and the manager knew they did not complete my order great customer service NOT! They have my number they could have called me.  Her excuse for the time it took was because she only had one cook and two servers and it was busy. And the website does not know how busy the restaurant was.... really!!??  How about talking to me when I arrived plus greeting me would had help your case too. But no you had attitude because you only had one order and you couldn't see my other order and walked away leaving standing there like I did not matter you could've said \"let me check on your order I'll be right back\" i honestly believe this was done on purpose. No excuses.  Up to 20 mins she also kept saying to me."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be reviewing a Denny's, let alone in Las Vegas, but this proved to be an excellent cheap breakfast alternative.  Scratch that, the ONLY cheap breakfast on the strip.  My group, 12 people, came here on Mother's Day hungover and hungry and we were promptly seated at 4 different tables, which was a-okay with us, as long as we could get food and coffee promptly.  The service was good, friendly and efficient.  The location itself seems new, for a Denny's, and pretty clean.  Food was good, nothing amazing, but definitely great hangover food and the coffee was fairly good.  Conveniently located near MGM on the strip, this is a great place to grab a bite if your looking for something cheap and reliable."}
{"text":"I didn't go into a Denny's at 10pm on Christmas and expect the best service, but this was ridiculous. For an establishment that prides itself on being a quick place to eat that's also 24 hours, this was truly a disappointment. To begin with, the manager warned us on arrival to a seemingly calm and not very busy room that food would be over an hour. Being the only thing open and starving from the airport, we foolishly decided to stay. We were seated and received the drink orders quickly, but after that it went downhill. No one checked in on us for refills the entire hour and a half we were there,  meanwhile three women were working the register and another two people were cleaning tables at a snails pace. Our server disappeared off the face of the planet. There was one waiter working 7 tables and he was clearly putting in at least a little effort, but save the chefs, no one else seemed to be working very hard. There was no management or sense of urfency/priority in what is supposed to be fast food. Once the food arrived it was mostly cold and one of the orders was forgotten completely, requiring them to go prepare a salad that was possibly the easiest dish to make in the first place. If the food was actually complicated and they were short staffed, I would have been more understanding, but this was a clear failure at every level. There were several other customers that were getting increasingly agitated with the lack of service and it was visibly apparent that staff was available to service everyone's needs. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The service want that good. I ordered build your own brand slam. I had better ones from other Denny's. The food was luke warm at best. I would not recommend this Denny's to anyone."}
{"text":"Super poor service Go in all the time with my son and just gets worse and worse each time. This last time(which is my last time going to this location) took about 15 plus minutes to even reach our table when there was only 2 servers in the whole place and hardly any tables sat. No one was helping eachother just standing around. Never coming again. Don't recommend at all"}
{"text":"Bad service bad management I keep saying I'll never go back to Dennys but in Phoenix there's not much choice if you want to eat foods just ok"}
{"text":"A small group of us and sometimes an extra friend or two come to this location EVERY Wednesday and most Thursday nights.  The first visit Jonathan was our server.  Talk about personality and professionalism, he had it all.  Excellent server in every way.  Now, we have been coming for quite a while and Jonathan got promoted to a night manager.  He has never forgotten serving us and has introduced us to a couple other servers who wait on us almost every time we are there who are wonderful too...Erica and Charlotte.    Today we are saddened to find out that Jonathan apparently has been moved to days instead of nights.  We also learned that Erica will not be here Wednesday nights any longer.  These employees are a big part of the reason we continue to come here weekly.  The food is good, but we come for the service and ambiance."}
{"text":"They messed up our order and waitress cane and apologized, she owned up to it.  Food was vreat.  Will continue to support this establishment even at 1 am."}
{"text":"It's funny, the only time I've been to Denny's is on vacation. The first time was back when I was little on our way through Denver, and the most recent times have been in Vegas, because between you and me, the hotel restaurants really jack up the price for breakfast.  We first discovered this Denny's the last time we were in Vegas several years ago and staying across from it at Treasure Island. And seven years later, not much has changed, besides the fact that this Denny's has moved to a bigger, roomier upstairs space near Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum.  Our first breakfast there was on a Saturday morning and while we did have to wait to be seated, it was maybe 10 minutes tops. Every morning after that was even less of a wait time, with Monday morning have no wait (although it seem to take a long time to get our food that morning).  Denny's menu is much better than I remembered as well with some nice, healthier scrambles and omelets and even a breakfast with banana pecan raisin pancakes that doesn't break the calorie bank. Portions are plentiful, gluten free options are available, and it's still the best bang for your breakfast buck on the strip.  Typically, service is pretty fast and they're turning over tables at a good clip. If you have a smaller party of two, you might even check to see if the counter has a couple of spaces (it's on the right of the restaurant when you walk in)  - those are first come, first serve, I believe.  Overall this place is just the same as any other Denny's, I think, but on the strip - it's a great deal in a world of gluttonous, overpriced buffets and alcoholic slushies."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner on a Sunday it was not so full inside we ordered salsa eggs Benedict and bourbon chicken sizzler it was very good but the poached eggs were over cooked it was almost a hard boiled egg.  The chicken sizzler was good but to less sauce on it.  At the end we ordered a dessert it was the chocolate lava cake it came with ice cream on top it was very good. I would recommend Denny's more for their  breakfast.  The service was very good."}
{"text":"Would of given 5 stars but, every time we come there is no  hostess to be found. I don't know why that is. Another couple in front of us left b/c it took so long for someone to sit us.That's my only complaint.    Food was awesome! New pancakes are really good! But the best thing we had was the Honey Jalapeno Bacon!Best Bacon we ever had hands down. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"The one thing I can count on at Denny's is consistent quality food, reasonably priced. An added bonus is that most Denny's are open 24 hours so I can get some good late night after a gig! I especially enjoy the service at this Dennys."}
{"text":"We were here early in the morning! we woke up for a walk at like 10am.. and we didn't get seated until an hour later. We waited for an hour .. I was so grumpy.. the staff are very attentive, they listen to what you want. My friend HATES cheese, and she ordered something but requested with NO cheese, but the kitchen people made her food with cheese, and she asked her staff to change it, and they did :) which was good, we left happy with the 2,4,6,8 menu. we're cheap.. :)  In my opinion, save the time and just go else where. There are like 3  different dennys on the strip, so you can choose, One by the mirage, the M&M factory:)"}
{"text":"I have to agree with another reviewer, you think it's only Denny's! Well I have to say that for a Denny's this one has their stuff together for the most part. Food is good, consistent. Staff is friendly, accomodating, makes suggestions and is right on top of keeping your coffee cup filled. I have been in on a couple of occasions and night staff is equally as friendly and even customized a few request for me.   Only suggestion I have is that they do need to get the stool over by the breakfast area replaced sometime soon. This has been broken for over a yr without replacement so you can only seat three at the breakfast nook. either replace it or get rid of breakfast nook all together and put in some tables.   Other than this they are doing a great job! Don't forget you can call ahead and get take out too."}
{"text":"This dennys restaurant is the worst dennys I have been. They forgt to give us a fork and a spoon then they only refillee my coffee once after I had asked two times. They also put a big difference between the people who spoke the same language as them. Plus the restrooms are super untidy and toilet paper was everywhere."}
{"text":"Make ur own burger at Denny's is the best idea, please try the bourbon sauce it's to die for... Thanks Denny's"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has bad reviews. Best service and food I've had at this franchise."}
{"text":"I go to Denny's for one thing.  Their good old fashioned turkey club sandwich.  I tried the closest one (2120 E. Cactus Rd.) but will not go back.  Their waitresses act like they never made it out of training and are quick to blame the cooks for their long delays and messing up orders.  So I have gone a few times to their location at 3205 E. Bell Rd..  Today, as I was picking up the fourth quarter of my turkey club, A ROACH WAS CRAWLING AROUND UNDER IT.  The manager ultimately came over and said she had been there 3 months and that hasn't happened before.  I said, \"Three months?  This Denny's has been here a lot longer than you.  You call that an excuse?\"    Yes, she gave me another to go at no charge for either.  The waitress who made it up told me she made it herself and is sure there are no roaches in it.  So that is what it takes to compensate for a dirty kitchen?  Prior to the last few months, I haven't set foot in a Denny's in twenty years.  Now I know why!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, not great but not bad. Service could be better but I think they work them too much as the few times we went there (our hotel is right behind it and we got 20% off for staying at the hotel) we seemed to see the same things each time. Order was wrong once, one time our server was doing half the restaurant, one time we were there at 4:30am and our server was the same guy there at 6pm. he said he went home at that morning and was back that afternoon. So they just need a couple more servers I think. Also, I got the strawberry pancake bites (not sure if that was their name but that's what they were ) with a soft cream cheese dip and it was super good!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here instead of the casino cafe where I normally go because I had teenagers with me.  AWFUL!  Sunny side up eggs were runny and under cooked (I know sunny side is a little less done but the whites weren't done).  Pot Roast melt sandwich - bread was crunchy not toasted and cold, fries were stone cold.  Pancakes were overdone and partially burned.  Iced tea had that sour/bitter taste you get after it has been sitting out for a day or two.  No sausage or bacon came with the breakfast that was ordered.  Four of us dining and only three meals came to the table - had to wait for the last one that was clearly missed/forgotten.  Maybe only two other tables in the restaurant at best.  Will never, ever go back to this Denny's again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for breakfast this morning. This location is much nicer (fresher and more stylish) then some of Denny's I have been to in the past. The service by Cathy V. and the supervisor was exceptional! Everthing was thought of - prompt and considerate!  My boyfriend and I had the Grand Slam (four items of choice). The blueberry buttermilk pancakes were flufty and delicious. The eggs were cooked correctly and had a nice dark yolk. The other items were acceptable but not outstanding. The 2 Grand Slams along with two juices, coffee and a tea came to 37.00 before the tip. It was a bit higher then I expected it to be but it makes sense.."}
{"text":"Everyone knows Brooklin/Whitby is poor man's Richmond Hill.  The Centrum is a large, open space \"plaza\" with a variety of services that cater to teens/young adults and families (ex. restaurants, mini golf, movie theaters).  A Denny's at this location fits into the poor man's Richmond Hill complex perfectly.  I can't stand their food, but I do appreciate their eggs done at a good price. And the waiters here were so friendly."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast must be under new management waiter Pico is the best. Manager even came to our table and ask how the food and service was. This place has diff entry changed for the better. Be sure to as for Pico."}
{"text":"Visited to have breakfast while I had my car worked on. It was delicious! I ordered my skillet without mushrooms but it was delivered to me with. Before I could even say anything, my waiter came back to correct it. Great service!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible!!! The restaurant is not full but there are a generous amount of people in the restaurant. I started out at the bar waited 10 mins no one offered me a glass of water instead of leaving I decided to go into the dining room area, things did not get any better after 7 mins I'm still waiting on the waitress to acknowledge me!!! If I did not have this free grand slam my ass would be out of here!!! I hope the food is much better than the service"}
{"text":"We ordered at the same time as the people sitting near us and the food took 50 minutes to arrive. Fifteen minutes after the table near us. Chock it up to Xmas Insanity. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wow  wow wow, selbst vier Monate nach unserem Vegas Besuch w√ºrde ich jetzt auf der Stelle so ein Restaurant besuchen um dort zu fr√ºhst√ºcken.  Wir, die das erste Mal in Amerika waren und uns vorher nicht gro√üartig erkundigt hatten was das amerikanische Essen angeht haben nicht schlecht gestaunt was man dort alles zum Fr√ºhst√ºck ist und es war klasse, es war lecker es war unvergesslich. Wir haben es als sehr schade empfunden das wir das Lokal in den ersten Tagen nicht entdeckt hatten. Ich denke mal wir w√§ren jeden Tag dort gewesen. Und dann auch noch preiswert im Gegensatz zu den Fr√ºhst√ºcken die wir vorher hatten."}
{"text":"Ehh. Dennys. What can I say about this location. Well the food is Okay, the service was decent and the cleanliness was not up to par. There was dirty forks under our booth and the floor was filthy. I had gotten the half serving of nachos. It had more pico then meat and cheese. The sour cream was just slapped on there. When we asked for our drinks I got a Diet Coke with cherry. The cherry syrup was at the bottom of our drink. Wasn't mixed in. All I tasted was syrup. The waitress was friendly but seemed like she was on autopilot and just doing her job. Still left a 20 percent tip though. I rarely eat at chain restaurants. But Dennys I wasn't feeling it. Wasn't satisfied at all. Just seems like a last resort place you would go to."}
{"text":"Great staff - very friendly and the only reason I give this a two.   The food was horrible and twice as much as your typical Denny's. Most people in Vegas were still nursing their hangovers so getting seated was no problem... so that's another plus"}
{"text":"we usually come in late night after work and after the bars in Fremont East close.. or sometimes i'll even order food to go. the bar is always fun for groups. drink prices are great. good food for a 24 hour place. no smoking or gaming with full access to the bar :)) the kitchen has been inconsistent though and doesn't seem to know the menu or care."}
{"text":"We frequent here atleast once a week or every two weeks. Kids eat free 6 to 10 tuesdays and Thursdays. Food is always good. Anytime I've ever had a substitution or issue they accommodate accordingly. Love smothered cheese fries and their value menu when money's tight. Breakfast is always good and they bring out suitable servings.   Great service, friendly staff and clean facility. I like how they have an ever changing menu that shifts according to season and popularity, its always creative and inventive. I have no complaints about this Dennys. I really like going here and it saves us a chunk them picking up the tab for the kids on certain days. Kudos to Dennys."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! If I could give it 0 stars I would! Not only did our waitress not even remember our order and wrote it down wrong, she got me horribly sick! I have an allergy to Peanut Butter and I get very sick. My fiance ordered ua a xhocolate shake and our friend a peanutbutter and chocolate. I took a sip of mine and BOOM peanut butter! You should know to keep them separate if it has a common food allergy component in it! Then, when we asked to split the checks, it took them 5 TRIES to get it right! Our server was rude and idiotic and the casheer was clueless. Wanna know the best part?? It was my birthday! Happy birthday to me! Now instead of gambling and having fun, ill spend it in a bathroom vomiting due to peanut butter allergies!"}
{"text":"Went here strictly for convenience and was pleasantly surprised.  The service was prompt and attentive, the food good and the price very reasonable.  You don't go to Denny's expecting gourmet cuisine, but they served us a very nice breakfast that kept me going all day.  I especially appreciated the clean restrooms.  I admit it was early in the day, but they were truly spotless. Will definitely visit again when the opportunity arises.  Kudos to the folks there."}
{"text":"This is the best Denny's / from the server - (Latoya's great) to the food, to the appearance of the restaurant. I would recommend this place to anyone coming by here. We had the French toast breakfast. All cooked & served perfectly."}
{"text":"The facility is nice. My chicken noodle soup was watered down and cold. It wasn't that good."}
{"text":"This Dennys had great service! The server Carolyn made the best chocolate milk ever and had a great personality! Would definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"This American chain actually has veggie burgers!! Really!! This location is a nice place too because of all the diner charm."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The establishment was new so it was nice and clean.  Tamika and Brenda, two of the best waitress in Vegas.  So funny and nice.  They catered to our every need and even enjoyed a lot of laughs and jokes with us.  The food was great."}
{"text":"The food is great, the staff is super friendly and they make their food their and they don't use frozen foods, all their food are fresh and"}
{"text":"It's seems as customer service at most Denny's restaurants way down. This is the third denny's that i stop on my way to school to try to eat breakfast. They are beeing very slow at akcnowleging customers arrivals. Not even a \" I be right with you\". Waitress yelling, at other waitress from one end of the room to another. Bathroom dirty and smells. Its wednesday 11:20am. Restaurant is not that busy for place to be that dirty."}
{"text":"Came here to eat breakfast but ended leaving. Restaurant did not appear busy. It took almost 10min before anyone even acknowlege me. Three customer coming out were all discusing how slow the whole service was. Over hear One of them tell the person she was paying, and no apologies weren't given just a smile. Thats when I decided to go to another place. It seems after the remodels in all denny's customer service in north phoenix share the same low customer service decline within this last year."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Danny's in town!! The servers there are horrible, I waited  30 mins for this lady to help me and when she finally came up to the table she just looked at me.. no hi, no \"are u guys ready\", no nothing!!! like wtf!   Then they forgot the chicken on my skillet, I said something to the server and I heard her talking shit with the cook in the back (as if I didn't know spanish) then brought me some dry over cooked cold chicken lol... I just had to laugh that one off.."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. The food is generally good. But, the bacon is greasy. I always need to pat it down before eating it. I have waited at the front to be seated when the place is pretty empty. But, they are friendly and the food in general is always good.   My favorite dish is the Alaskan Salmon Skillet. The Salmon is super moist and flavorful. The veggies are usually cooked very well, not mushy. I'm not a fan of the tomatoes they put in it, they tend to be a little mushy. Maybe they can add them more towards the end of the cooking process. The Club Sandwich is very good, too. Breakfasts are filling. My only complaint would be that the bacon, as before, is too greasy and sometimes to floppy."}
{"text":"I understand it's a busy weekend being a holiday weekend. We tried to call in an order and ended up waiting on hold for 27 minutes so we decided to drive there instead and order. I didn't get the name of the manager who was working (brunette, probably late 30s early 40s) but she made everything better and comped the meal for us. I felt terrible complaining cause we go there often and they usually have such great service but to be on hold for almost 30 minutes and then go to find nobody at the counter when we show up for a minute...She provided great customer service to redeem the slack of the servers."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of dennys but this one was not the greatest experience... It took 15 minutes from the time we sat down to get our waters, about 25 minutes for the milkshake we ordered, about 50 minutes for the food to arrive. 1 person at our table had the nachos and they were old and soggy and the meat tastes so gross, I asked for the ultimate omelette with no meat and the server said \"so just the veggie omelette\" and I said sure but I don't want the zucchini or squash from the veggie omelette..when I received my omelette it had nothing but mushrooms and cheese... And he didn't bring the toast for at least 15  minutes after. I wouldn't go to this dennys again because there were so many screw ups and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"I ordered egg in a basket and it comes back with the egg fried hard. I asked the server to take it back and have the eggs over easy more or less and the manager grabs the my plate from the window and stands there arguing with me that it's \"cooked in a bun\" well no shit it's an egg in a basket genius! After he rolls his eyes he brings it back to the kitchen and this is what the server brings me back. It's not rocket science on how to make an egg in a basket! You toast the \"basket\" first then drop your egg in the center. I could've made this at home saved myself the money and the attitude. Lesson learned. No wonder this place looks depressing. I would never recommend this place"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. I am a Denny's fan but this location can't be corporate and if a franchise it is not being managed at all! I made 2 attempts to eat here. The first attempt  I was seated at a dirty table... filthy actually. Waited 20 minutes for coffee. The coffee was watery and smelled burnt. Then I waited another 10 minutes for another version of the same. I promptly left and went next door to Outback Steak where I got fresh coffee great food and service. Tonight I thought I would try Denny's again. BTW my home is Marin CA where I ate at Denny's every day until they closed. So tonight I was seated in a section of the restaurant which had no server.  I was told the other section...the front of the restaurant was too busy which is why I was seated in the back. Again, the same scenario I waited 10 minutes and no server. I kept looking behind me and I could see a female manager and 3 employees just milling around. Finally in passing I told the hostess and asked why she sat us in a section with no server. She said she did not know. In summary there are so many good places near by don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Total shithole, waited 20 minutes and didn't even get an order in.  Unbelievable that this is a business and not a money laundering front, no one that wanted repeat customers would behave this way.   The menu stuck to itself, wish I could go negative with the rating."}
{"text":"This Denny's was pretty packed, but since we went in needing a table for two, we didn't have to wait for long. Denny's delivered in aiding my hangover- Thank You!   We went through a couple different servers. One was pretty young and told us that she had to take her break, so that was a little strange.    I thought that the cost was pretty comparable to other Denny's, making this a pretty affordable option for the area."}
{"text":"This place needs a very very good scrub down. Everything is so dirty. If the dining room/high chairs/walls look this bad I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. Clean up dennys!"}
{"text":"So we showed up about 7:20 on a Friday night. 2 dads with 4 kids. All of us hungry. The restaurant was over half empty. We seated and ordered promptly.  40 mins later we were offered a to go box by a waitress whom we told we never received our food. 10 minutes later we finally caught our waitress and she said she would check. 10 more minutes, no sign of her and patrons leaving after eating who came in after us.  We left. We went to wild wings next door. You can see my review on that page. What did we order that confused the kitchen? 3 kids ordered chicken nuggets and goldfish crackers.  Yes the nuggets Tyson sales that you bake for 10 minutes and goldfish that you literally open a bag for. The other 3 of us ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, and pancake breakfast. That's it. Waited an hour on that with the restaurant half empty. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Before you read this review keep in mind I only go here after 11 PM at night as I often work late. I usually come here once a week for a late night dinner/snack. I usually come with a group of 3-6 people. The food is good for what you can expect from Denny's. I understand they are short staffed at night but all to often we get poor service. Sometimes we walk in and it takes an employee 5 minutes to notice and seat us. Another 5-10 to order drinks and food. The food typically comes out quickly for the late shift. The number one thing that bothers me is refills, it takes forever to get a refill of water or coffee. Sometimes we do get a good waiter (our favorite waitress), but its usually the same handful of waiters that don't pay attention. I will still continue to come here because its really the only option for a decent 1-3 AM meal."}
{"text":"The ultimate skillet was more like vegetable skillet. Barely any sausage. Pancake is good. Food is decent too. Overall just an average."}
{"text":"Don't eat here if you like hot food!!!  As I am typing this I am sitting at my table in this Denny's.  First you should know I am not a complainer.  For me to say something the service and/or the food has to be BAD.  1. I have only seen my waitress 2x in the 30 minutes I have been here.  First when she took our order then 20 minutes later she walked by after someone else brought our food. *update* another 10 minutes have gone by and she's nowhere to be found. 2. When she finally came to the table a second time we asked for a coffee refill...and she brought the pot and only offered coffee to my Great Aunt...even though I had also ordered coffee and was holding up my cup. Aren't you supposed to offer refills to everyone at the table that ordered coffee? 3. The food was lukewarm....ALL OF IT. Clearly it sat in the window for a while. Nothing was hot.  NOTHING.  Isn't it understood that you cook the waffle LAST since it takes much less time to cook than the other food?? 4.apparently our order was held up by a waffle that WE DID NOT ORDER.  and then when this second mystery waffle pops up at the table hot....while the rest of the food was lukewarm to cold at this point...I was at least able to ask \"is that waffle hot?\" and switch them out.  My expectations are not that high...it's a Denny's after all.  But seriously....they can do better than this.    This experience is like being dropped in the middle of the Canadian wilderness with no help after they let you out of the car.  I'm at the point where I may get up and go get my own coffee.    I will stick with my original point, that I said to my family as they decided against me, \"why are we going to a Denny's in Canada when we have them at home?\"  *Update*  Another 5 min have ticked by and no waitress..."}
{"text":"First off let me tell you it pains me to say this,  but I have a bad review coming.  I'm a server myself and work in one of the busiest restaurants in Lake county. So I hate to give a bad review,  but I'm thinking this needs to be shared to hopefully help them get better.  By far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. There was a wait for a table of about 10 minutes at 1130 on Saturday,  that's fine. Then we waited about 10 minutes for menus from the bus boy and then it took another 5 minutes for our server to greet us. 5 more for drink delivery.  I could see people waiting for food all around us,  but it was obvious they were getting impatient. We decided to stay,  but I'm sorry I did.  The special menus on the table were sticky and very dirty. The regular menus we were given felt a little oily.  The table next to us had a problem with his slam burger.  He said he didn't want gravy. The waitress replied \" it's not gravy,  it's queso cheese\". She didn't offer to fix it in any way and left.  He tried taking it off with a napkin only to finally flag her down and ask for a replacement. Which they messed up as well. They ate and left.  There was an order of fries at my table that was sent back to be done \"no seasoning\". They came out with (very light) seasoning. I'm glad the person wasn't allergic. None of our food was actually hot like it was just cooked. My gravy hasn't developed a \"skin\" on top so I know it wasn't under a heat window,  so it might not have been kept at a temp of at least 140... food safety first guys!  The bathroom was scary to say the least. No sanitizer in the dispenser wasn't even the worst part of it. The handicapped stall was Out Of Order. And I'm glad my daughter used the other stall,  because mine was horrid.   Now I have to say I've never seen a bathroom napkin disposal can completely full,  but today I saw it. Moving on... at least they had soap.  :)  Our server was nice but maybe was stretched too thin.  They were quadrupole seating her."}
{"text":"Service was good by server Amanda but when their employee Kevin brought us our food and placed my plate in front of me it had a brown avocado on it, so my husband asked him if we could get fresher avocados on it because im pregnant and Kevin just snatches the plate off the table and doesn't say a single thing to us and was all rude about it. We will never come back here."}
{"text":"WORST service ever!! Attempted to eat here with 3 friends, just now,  but we were never seated. The waitress walked past us 3 times and said excuse me to move past us, but never once actually acknowledged us. We felt like we weren't welcome. After waiting 10 min, we finally left. The waitress was at the register , not assisting anyone, when I said  \"Guess we will leave!\" She had the nerve to say \"Bye, thank you!\"   What makes it even worse is that they weren't even busy!! There were 4 tables max!   I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!!!! Terrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for breakfast and had not been to Denny's in at least a couple years. The food was much better than I expected. I had pancakes, scrambled eggs (which actually had flavor), hash browns (crispy) and sausage. Needless to say, I was not able to finish the huge plate full of food. The waitress was exceptionally nice and very efficient. I would come back to this location next time I feel the need for a big breakfast."}
{"text":"Took an hour to be served. Horrible service. Didn't even get water. Waiting for a half hour and no service. A waitress didn't come to our table to say hi. We walked up to the guy at the hostess stand and told him we haven't been seen and he said oh sorry I'll be there in a minute. We waited another ten min and no help still. We got up and left and warned anybody else coming inside. This place needs new management. How do your run a business on NYE and stay 24 hours if you can't handle a rush at 1 am?"}
{"text":"This is the first time and the last time we wikl come to this dennys . We've been waiting for our food for over 45 minutes.  We are not the only tabel that's waiting, tables that were here before us have STILL not gotten there food.  Worst dennys ever.  Should have went to ihop ."}
{"text":"Tired of dining at Casinos buffet restaurants, I decided to go to Dennys and had traditional breakfast. The pancakes were kind of soggy, others were OK. Still good to taste comparing to buffets."}
{"text":"Dropped by for their version of chicken fried steak which is called Country fried steak.  Came with mashed potatoes and choice of vegetable which for us was broccoli.  It also came with garlic toast.  It was delicious especially with the white gravy. The portion was generous as well.   I had the soup and grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese on whole wheat bread was not greasy at all and had plenty of cheese. The soup of the day was New England Clam Chowder (white one) and it was possibly the best new England clam chowder I have ever had.  The reason, it was thick, had potatoes with lovely chunks of clams which were not rubbery AND, AND AND, MOST OF ALL  the bacon-y flavor.  I didn't see chunks of bacon but it had a lovely bacon-y flavor and who doesn't love bacon?   We had the apple cobbler for dessert and it was delish.   Our server, Brooklyn, was spot on in terms of attention and service--totally attentive to our needs.  Next time I go I will ask for Brooklyn.  Love her name too!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Denny's I've ever been to! We returned the pancakes as they were unbelievable bad done! I mean come on how hard is to screw up pancakes. This is without mentioning the loooong time it took to bring the food. Shame on you Denny's."}
{"text":"Love their western omelette.  But the service we he last Saturday was horrible.  It took 15 minutes to even have our waiter come to our table and ask for our drinks then it took another 40 minutes to get our meals.  By the. My kids were cranky and crying"}
{"text":"The best dennys I have ever been to. Food, service, and cleanliness were above what I expected. I went like 5 times and was never disappointed."}
{"text":"Just ate at Denny's food was great Shannon was our server he was great fast service for him being the only one and them being busy. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is dirty and smells of old food. The bathrooms need major improvement, cleaning u name it. The staff was not that great at all. Its Like the Restaurant needs some Major make over   It was 90 degrees outside and inside the restaurant wasnt much cooler that i was shivering. My Lemonade tasted funny, the food was OK i would prefer going to a more up scale Denny's. But to be honest I  Will not be going back to this location until they do some house cleaning and i mean it.    I mean it its not family friendly and I look at based on how clean the establishment is, u name it."}
{"text":"We used to come to this place when we lived in the area years ago. It was nothing to rave about but solid fare and good service. Tonight tho .... The person who sat us apologized for the wait it took to seat us 8 min or something . She actually said .... I'm so sor ty but there is a lot of stuff to get done but life's a Bitch. I daid... Excuse me, did you just curse? She denied it but my wife confirmed it.  Anyway I asked for fries as an appetizer and she said she would put it down . 10 minutes later another server asks if we are ready to order. I said yes but can you check on our fries? She didn't know anything about it and asked the cook Eric if he put fries down.... Blank look from him.  We order 2 spaghetti and waiting 20 min later our order gets put in the waiter and the cook is dinging his bell. The waitress Tammie yells.... I'm stuck at the register Eric! Anyway, our order is dying in the window for like 10 min. I actually had to raise my voice and ask if that was order dying in the window. Tammie goes to the food and asks the cook if he was going to put mushrooms on the spaghetti. IT WAS NOT EVEN READY!!  When it finally got to us it had this giant mass of meat piled atop the the pasta and sauce . I'm not usually one to complain about Too much meat but this greasy meat just ruined an otherwise passable pasta dish .  The staff at this time of night on this day 10:10 pm on 1/11/2017 was so disorganized and unprofessional then the food..... never returning to this place again!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful half a cup of soup I work at Olive Garden this would get me fired"}
{"text":"Unfortunately our waitress Maria chose to completely ignore us. She served several latin people and never came to us. She walked passed us three times to serve yhe other people all while ignoring us. I am very disappointed & will be in touch with theor corporate headquarters. Another waitress took our order, she had a not of an attitude..  I believe it was with Maria. Because after Chelsea took a second to cool out.. She was cool. How in the hell do you ignore us. Can we say DISCRIMINATION!!!??? They only get 1 star because i had to."}
{"text":"Christel is macheen! She's a beautiful flower child sent from the server heavens. She made sure to constantly check if we were satisfied with our meals and we had great small talk! If you come here ask for her and you'll definitely be enlightened."}
{"text":"Got sat immediately, waited 15 min with no greet as 3 servers passed by multiple times as the restaurant wasn't busy in the least, left. Having served 5 years in the past this is unexcusable, apparently no sense of customer service what so ever."}
{"text":"This place is close to our house and my husband and I started going for breakfast on Sunday mornings. the food is pretty good but we really keep going back because of Kristola. She is good at what she does and always makes sure we are taken care of. It can get very busy on Sunday mornings and we had been getting mixed service. Sometimes we got a good server sometimes not. After we got Kristola a few times we started only asking for her when we come in and are always disappointed if she is not in that day. I am now pregnant and am picky these days (lol) but she always makes sure my order is how I like it!"}
{"text":"Listen I am not proud of it but sometimes even though you travel far to Vegas you gotta eat and its late and you have a small college girl budget so you might as well turn to an oldie but goodie in the college food choices realm and go to Denny's because it's 3 am after your clubbing event and you are tired up the wazoo. Listen everyone knows Denny's food is mediocre but for 8 bucks you can get filled up and to be honest their shakes are as good as higher priced places and you can always rely on the. 24 hour availability   Hopefully won't be back but don't blame me if I do!!"}
{"text":"It has been years since I ate at Denny's but this one on The Strip is in a class by itself. The service was first class and fast. And the food was definitely a winner. I will be back for breakfast again before I leave town."}
{"text":"I know, I know. I went to DENNY'S in VEGAS when I could have gone to way more \"foodie-worthy\" fancy places, but hey, I was with a group of girls from NY and they just wanted something casual, something they'd heard of before. So Denny's it was!  Seems like this was a new opened Denny's. It was clean, the food was decent and service was nice. Since we were a large group, it took a little time for our food to come out, but overall we were all satisfied with our meals.   Since it was a friend's bday, they were nice enough to come out and sing Happy Birthday to her with a slice of chocolate cake to boot! We also tried to Caramel Apple Crisp which I'd highly recommend if you're looking for something sweet on the menu. I'm not saying I'm going to go to Denny's out here in the Bay Area, but I am saying it did the trick for a bunch of hungry gals in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is an awesome location right across from C.O.P. love to stop here for a quick bit before heading out to Banff. They alway have quick friendly service. Food is consistent with avert large selection that can pretty much satisfy the pickiest customer. I would rate the Menu a 4 star. But this is still fast food dinner type of Resturant. If you want value breakfast this is the place. They also have greasy items as well if you like fried stuff."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite before a movie.  This Denny's is rather large and on a weekday during the middle of the day it's no problem getting in for some fast chow.  Our server today was Trudie.  Unlike other servers in the past, Trudie was an absolute sweetie and no stranger to working tables with a smile.  Denny's is cheap, quick food and that's about it.  It has about as much soul as IHOP.... which in none."}
{"text":"always friendly, helpful, and food is always good. If they make a mistake they are quick to fix it. This is a really good location to check out, and I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"such an awful experience. waitress had absolutely no idea what she was doing, order came out in parts every thirty minutes, wrong every single time. we were then overcharged and treated horribly by the manager when we disputed the bill. All the while, customers were left waiting to be helped while other workers stood around and did nothing. As we left we heard the manager telling the other patrons we didn't know what we were talking about, and laughing, trying to make us seem like the incompetent ones. Worst experience at a denny's I've ever had. Will not be coming back anytime soon. Save yourself the trouble and go to the one on chandler blvd instead, they actually care about their customers."}
{"text":"I was all about this Denny's location until my second visit. So I'm giving it 2 stars for the first visit & I will tackle both visits in my review.  The first visit was to redeem my free birthday grand slam (all you have to do is show your ID on your birthday!) The wait looked like it was going to be a long one but we were actually seated within 5 minutes - which was awesome. Our service was good considering how busy the place was. Our food came out as we expected - it's friggin Denny's... don't expect much, ha! The server left our receipt on the table and we paid the cashier without a problem. Nice & quick breakfast.   Our second visit was another story. It took a while to be seated... but we figured it would. We had just hoped for a quick seating like the first visit. Our server eventually came over and took our order... which, he was nice but I believe had way too much going on to be attentive. When our food finally arrived (took a while) my plate didn't look exactly look like it had the day before. The potatoes weren't as crispy as I had liked, mostly. The pancake wasn't as fluffy either. Seemed like the cooks were in a rush. We ate anyhow - wasn't a table of complainers. It took a while for our server to acknowledge our empty drinks and by the time he did, it was time to drop the check. So there's that. We finally got to pay and get out.  Now, I've never really had food poisoning so I'm not entirely sure of the time frame but about 2 to 3 hours after eating here I got the worst stomach cramps and all the other symptoms  (according to google) or food poisoning. It ruined my day. Again, I've never experienced food poisoning before but something here during my 2nd visit didn't sit quite well in my stomach... so beware. I don't personally see myself returning."}
{"text":"The food was good, service not so much! There was not enough staff to accommodate all of the guest in the location. We were seated and then 3 different parties that came in afterwards had their order taken 1st. This is a busy strip so I'm not sure why this location is understaffed"}
{"text":"Currently in this restaurant waiting for an open table. They say it's a ten minute wait. Just behind me on the side of the restaurant that faces US60 is an entire unused section of empty tables, so why are we waiting? Also, don't know what it is with a Dennys and sewer smells in the entryway but this is the second one I've encountered like this. Its hardly appetizing to wait for a table unnecessarily and in the meantime have our appetites killed by the aroma of human excrement. Will advise later on food quality if and when we're seated. As for now, first impression is far from favorable.  Update - after waiting 15 more minutes, it was obvious to us that if we were ever seated, we'd be faced with a minimum of 1hr waiting on food. Ridiculous. Whoever manages this place needs to get their act together. One server on duty makes no sense. We left. Went to another Dennys on Broadway"}
{"text":"I know an amazing server when I see one and Steven was awesome... I could tell he was a very experienced server and knew how to handle customers with the utmost care. His service skills were something I had only truly seen in high end restaurants and I appreciated that even though he is at Denny's he continues where he left off... We all get knocked down and sometimes it's for the stupidest reasons but it's getting back up that is worth every minute... The food was great and tasted amazing for y'all rating this place 2 1/2 stars it will be near a 5 star restaurant with Steven and Dominique running that place. I just wanna say... Great job you are awesome and if anyone goes here you know the people to look for. I tip my hat! Thank you for an outstanding meal with A1 service!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty, filling, uncomplicated meals, especially  breakfast. Busy location but, they have quick service. Had a minor setback once and talked it over with the manager who did after a long discussion over-compensate us. He managed to keep our business. They remodeled and now it looks nicer with added seating."}
{"text":"The food here at this dennys location is okay but the service here is totally lacking the service here is slow and when I say slow it is real slow, and most of the time I have come here the tables, were often dirty or the floors were really dirty I don't think I would ever come to this dennys again and that's a shame because this dennys is not far from where I live."}
{"text":"Ate at this Dennys with a friend and two other friends as I we went to freemont and afterwards decided to eat here. The service was good she got the refills each time and got the food to us quick and kept checking on us the only problem though outside of the service and why I'm giving this place 3 stars is the food is ordered the lumberjack grand slam mostly everything was good except the pancakes I ate a couple of bites and after eating half way through the last pancake I saw that it wasn't cooked and it was just doughy raw batter it was the nastiest thing I ever saw the lady did take it back and took it off the bill because of the issue but still that was bad on the cooks part they need to get it together back there overall I might see myself going back one day."}
{"text":"Classic diner breakfast. We ordered the lumbar jack since it is the heartiest breakfast with no carbs."}
{"text":"I eat here fairly often, and usually the food and service are ok. When the service is bad, though, it's REALLY bad! Tonight I waited well over a half hour for a refill of my coffee, and only got it when I got really angry and complained vigorously. (Politely, but they knew I was mad.) Usually when I see service this bad here they soon close for a while then reopen under new management."}
{"text":"This place is extremely unorganized. Most of the employees didn't know what they were supposed to do. Our server, Yolanda, was rude and inattentive. Worst Denny's experience ever. 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"Is it gourmet, of course not.  Can dennys get five stars? Yes, I believe they can, by being the best in the chain. Faster than average dennys service. Quick, greasy spoon, service from servers that could,be your mom.  Eggs could be cooked with less oil dripping from them. Same for the hash browns.  Best Denny's I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Come get your sugar rush at 5am after dancing all night in the clubs! Grand Slam!!  If anything im just happy this Denny's exist on the strip. Talk about life savor. Its also pretty fun to see who comes in and how hammered everyone is.   Great service!"}
{"text":"Some of the best service I have gotten at a resturant hands down. I don't remember her name but she was a beautiful platinum blonde. Food was good but were will be back for the great service!"}
{"text":"This wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be, and that is saying something.  For some reason, I found my ass at Denny's. Yes, there are plenty of other places to go, but when visiting older relatives, Denny's seems to be the equivalent to crack. For breakfast, you will have many cheap options that will fill your belly. For lunch or dinner, I would ask that you find something else. ANYTHING else.   The shocking thing was it was gratifying to pay $5 for breakfast that seemed to complete it's requirements just as well as one of those fancy hipster brunch places. But because I am a fancy hipster brunch person at heart, I'll probably be spending $15 for breakfast in the near future."}
{"text":"Packed, but line went fast, super cheap prices compared to anything else on the Strip, and perfect for hungover mornings!  Waitresses are kind of slow and the food is definitely not as good as most other Denny's I've been at (Moons on my hammy was fail) but since I was still kind of tipsy everything seemed delicious..."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. They mess up on 3 orders that were to go.  1.  Nachos sat so long on counter they were soggy when got home.  2.  Skillet Breakfast asked for eggs over medium and were so undercooked they were runny.  3.  Cheeseburger was burnt so bad couldn't eat.  Called and talked to Manager named Chris and he says ya we are going through cook issues.      Well that isn't my problem.  He says can't do anything about your bad order but let the cooks know.  Well I can't do anything about it either but let everyone who reads this know...Worst place ever!  Will never ever go there again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this dennys since 83. We called it ghetto dennys before the remodel. When it would rain, they would take all the trash cans to collect the rain from the lowest ceiling tiles. They would seat you next to a trash can full of mold water.  Granted.... New owners and a fresh remodel. The grill is magical and puts out the best food of any dennys I've been too. The Chef, he works hard. When there is nothing to do he is cleaning the walls while the wait staff stands around and gossips about other staff, even customers.  Getting them to clean the counter or table tops is  like you're asking too much from them. Almost every time they have seated us at a crusty table or left me and my guest at the counter with hour old nastiness right next to us.... and it's not like they are busy. They stand around or disappear completely.    Getting a coffee or water refill in a timely manner is difficult. The servers disappear from site for 5 to 10 min at time leaving you to have to ask another server for help.  A check?... good luck, you may have to just get up and stand at the register to get help like I've seen many customers do. I don't get it... the food is good and the service blows (85% of the time).  Come on management... read the reviews and shake it up over there. Get rid of some of the old dead weight keeping you reviews crappy. Your employees are settled in and complacent, in turn lacking motivation. The 2 stars are for wait staff.  4 stars for the Chef."}
{"text":"Way back in my university days, we would often end up here late at night. But now, we came here for lunch to chat and strategize before and important meeting.  They were very accommodating to us sitting around with coffees for a long time while we talked. The lunch was also good.  I had a spicy chicken skillett which was Awsome. Other had a clubhouse sand which is a classic and always good to see on the menu.   And one of us had breakfast. All day breakfast is the best."}
{"text":"Wifi Password: dencan1755  Good hearty food. Cant go wrong with a franchise. Ya inside the hotel so look for the hotel. Fairly new ans close to the airport so if you're looking to kill time before your flight and don't want to eat inside the airport you should come here.  Hotel parking is free and available for Dennys guests too."}
{"text":"Went to eat at this Denny's location with some friends, ordered the steak and potato skillet and they failed to deliver both times I sent it back. The first time, the steak was cold as ice (it sat on the counter for a long time). The second time, he brought it remade and it was smoking severely from the skillet and was all burnt to a crisp. The server was a pretty big asshole about it and I heard him yelling about my order to the kitchen from my table. Definitely will not be returning to this Denny's anytime soon."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Tuesday morning for breakfast with my daughter. Heard it had been remodeled, so curiosity got the best of us.  We were greeted and seated right away. The inside had been remodeled and had a much more open feel than before. The floors are now hardwood instead of carpet. Everything looked great except the Windows. Maybe they were due to be cleaned, but they were streaked and dirty.   Our server came over, introduced herself and told us about a few items featured on the menu. We ordered the build your own French toast breakfast and one of the fit fare breakfasts. The food took awhile, but everything came out hot.   The fit fare breakfast came with Turkey bacon, fruit, English muffin dry along with egg whites scrambled with spinach and tomatoes. Everything was delicious! The egg whites seemed a bit dry, but that may have been due to being cooked to be lower in calories. The turkey bacon was cooked just right. The fruit was a perfect mix of strawberries, bananas, grapes and cantaloupe!   My daughter ordered their new multigrain French toast with caramelized pecans and cream cheese frosting. I had to have a couple bites. Okay, it was just sinful! Omg! Delicious!  The service was okay. They weren't that busy, but the food took quite awhile. Our server didn't come back after food was served to make sure everything was okay or to refill drinks. She did come back when we were almost done. And while our server wasn't unpleasant, she wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"Country-Fried Steak & Eggs Skillet $8.00 Raspberry Ice Tea $2.19  Time in: 10:15 Time out: 10:  Tab: $11.02  Didn't come for the atmosphere, came for being able to ask for breakfast/lunch/dinner at any hour of the day, wish I would've known there was a Denny's here last night.  Server Danelle was really nice, even gave me a to-go cup for my ice tea. Food was good, didn't expect too much out of a Denny's. Will definitely keep this place in mind when I have an overnight around the Phoenix airport again"}
{"text":"I have been here before and I thought I would make a return visit for Pancake Tuesday with a friend. I ordered a Build your own Slam with pancakes, sausage links, eggs, and hash brown. Overall the food was really good. The pancakes were done well without getting burnt, and the sausage, eggs, and hash browns were all fried up as expected.  Where the rating went down considerably was the customer service. My friend ordered a Build you own Slam and ordered 1 order of buttermilk pancakes and 1 order of whole wheat. He also ordered a few more items.   The server comes back with 1 order of buttermilk/whole wheat pancakes. My friend calls her over and explained he ordered one each of buttermilk and whole wheat pancakes and not a blend. She apologized but then she told him it was weird to ask for a blend. Then why not clarify with the customer if she thought it was an unusual order! You can't leave the customer without full clarification. She offered to order another item but with the restaurant half full, it can't be guaranteed the order will come in on time. What are we supposed to do then, wait for the new order to come in? She didn't offer other options like taking a few bucks off the total bill. Overall the food is as expected in a typical diner, but to screw up an order is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes after I placed my order and still hadn't received my food. We ended up walking out. Complete waste of time and no apologies from the staff."}
{"text":"Always good service and great food! I am a regular here and the staff are always so friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I suggest not coming here during midnight, that is, unless you want service that is super-slow.  Otherwise, make sure you bring your patience with you."}
{"text":"We just came for my mom's free grand slam to celebrate her birthday! They were sweet enough to give my son the free kid's meal which they offer on Tuesdays. The food was delicious :-) They were kind enough to honor our food allergies. The service was warm and friendly just like you'd expect from a favorite neighborhood breakfast diner! The manager brought us the food herself and made sure that my mom was having a great experience. My son loved his veggie burger and the awesome side salad that came with it. Thanks for the making the evening special for us!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Holiday Cookie Milk Shake (\"Our creamy, hand-dipped milk shake is made with premium vanilla ice cream blended with cookie butter, then topped with whipped cream and shortbread pieces. Served with a little extra in the tin\" according to the website) and she gave me a chocolate milkshake with shortbread crumbs because she didn't know what cookie butter was. She didn't even offer a refund when I clearly told her I wanted cookie butter in it (the only reason why I drove 10 miles to this location)"}
{"text":"Denny's is the most affordable breakfast in town. It is not the best food - but it is fast, cheap, and good service.   I went to Denny's around 1 pm on a Saturday and was served in under 10 minutes. My waitress Linnea was extremely attentive and nice. She helped me pick out how to order what I wanted - 2 eggs, hash brown, bacon, and a biscuit and gravy. This didn't match any of the combos on the menu but she figured out a way to give me all that for $4!  The food came out quickly and accurately. There was nothing wrong with it - just not the best. But you can't expect the best for $4 at a Denny's.  I'd choose Denny's over IHOP or Perkins any day."}
{"text":"The service sucked the cook was the one that seated us. When we got our food the egg was still undercook yes the egg how hard is it to cook a dam egg. When we told the lady who we payed with just said \"oh ok\" cranky ass workers. I recommend Kay's cafe is well worth the extra 5 minute drive and well worth the money."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend  come here the waiter does a  great job making the holiday shakes."}
{"text":"Today we was sitting outside the parking lot of Denny s before leaving we heard a dog barking in a car. I got out to look around there was a grey car with nevada license plates parked in front of dennys that had a pet carrier inside. The car was shut off It was 95 degrees outside nobody was in the car. Temps get up to 120 in the car at this degree.  I waited 10 minutes finally the owners came out and left. I spoke to the Dennys manager he was wearing a dark shirt with blue grey stripes and black glasses. I was expressing my concern sayings its too hot to leave animals in the car in this heat. The manager said the lady visits Denny s often and she leaves her dog in the car all the time people always complain. It seemed like he didn't want to hear my complaint and wanted me to go away. Maybe someone should investigate the lady. My question is why hasn't the manager done anything about peoples complaints has he ever called the cops?? They shouldn't be sitting in the Denny s eating with their dog locked in the car. Any animal or human can die in the heat of a car."}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast to go and when I opened my order I was shocked to see that the food was undercooked. I didn't expect much out of a Denny's but under cooked food is just crazy and unsafe. I ordered a breakfast slam and The hashbrowns as well as the bacon where is severely undercooked. I will never be returning back to this Denny's furthermore any other Denny's if this is the quality of food. I'm just disgusted and very disappointed to see a restaurant be managed under these conditions were you offer customers on cook poultry and meals."}
{"text":"Ok, we all know that Denny's is a quick service place for your typical American dishes.  We know that coming in.   What we didn't know is that waiters, or maybe it was just waiter Greg T., expect patrons to pass plates to each other to save Greg work.  There were 12 men for breakfast and Greg would just hand the plates to the first person at the table and expected the customers to pass the plates one to another, one to another, one to another.  So if you were the last person on the plate route, you ended up with at least 6 or 7 hands who had touched your plate by the time you got it.  Nice way of spreading the flu Greg. What's the matter Greg T?  Too hard for you to be a waiter and go to each person and give them his plate?   That's what a waiter does Greg.  That's what a waiter does.   And BTW Greg T,  don't ask patrons to hand you dirty dishes.  That's your job.  Maybe your boss will see this and determine that you need some training, a new attitude or both."}
{"text":"Good pancakes, bad eggs. Bad customer service, looks like prison (needs brighter colors), bacon was flimsy, grape jelly too salty, hash browns not crispy enough, knives not sharp enough to cut my pancakes, chairs should recline, straws were too round, napkins felt like toilet paper, WAY TOO COLD, they didn't even offer the wifi password"}
{"text":"As always,  good food for a fair price. A bit of a wait, but oh well. Great music if you're an oldies fan to bide your time. Staff is very friendly and helpful and overall efficient.  Always good for last minute late night stop."}
{"text":"I've been to this Denny's, I want to say about 3 times and I have never had an issue at all... Last time I went there I ordered the chicken cheese steak and it was amazing... We had a male server who was there the previous times. He must have went home and we had Karla... Karla was a good server besides the fact I had to ask for certain things more than once the service was OK. She stated she had other customers to handle and we were in this restaurant about 7pm. A total of maybe 8 tables for 2 servers. But that is not why I'm giving 5 stars. The 5 stars is for the manager Marie who was very attentive and diligent on helping me with the issue of being charged almost 34 dollars for a 17 dollar meal. I called the following day when I realized that it had been a mistake. Seemed Karla charged me for a meal again trying to take her tip. I appreciate a great manager even though staff somrtimes make mistakes Marie was able to assure me that it would be taken care of. Which it had. So my overall experience was a 5 regardless of the server that night Marie made my yelp reviews a 5 because of how quickly and easily she handled the situation understanding that an error had been made and needed to be fixed. Thank you Marie for being a great supervisor/manager for every time that I have eaten at this location."}
{"text":"Worst waitress. Right when we were sitting down we waited 45 minutes just to get drinks then when she took are order which was 20 minutes later our food didn't come complete my daughter didn't get to eat and right when she got her Burger she didn't even want anymore, it was cold and nasty. I was also charged extra for cheese sticks i Never ordered. I called today to talk with someone to get it fixed they hang up on me. I am a local here in vegas. I am forsure never coming here again."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. We ate there on Christmas Day at dinner time while traveling. The servers were cheerful, friendly, and efficient even after being there many hours. I would definitely go there again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.   Gave up several tables that would've suited us and made me and my family with wait with a little baby.   Pathetic service on Thanksgiving  The management should be ashamed of themselves"}
{"text":"Poor customer service and the food wasn't that good either. The Bus Boy had to wait on us because the Waitress forgot us and alot of other guests!!! Bathroom wasn't cleaned, I met the owner before (Vincent) and I know he wouldn't approve of such services at this Denny's. We left and went to Winchell's Pub and Grill my 1st time there. It was in the same parking lot, I thought it was a whole in the wall fantastic breakfast loves my fluffy pancakes!!!!  I'am a proud US Army Soldier Vet 82nd Airborne Ranger also a home owner in the community Aliente!!! I won't be back at Denny's Simmons until fixed!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday morning at 11am. I guess you can't expect much from 24hour because the staff are understandably & usually more tired than other places. Food was great & I 100% recommend their hash browns.  However the service ? Odd. I'm assuming our server was new because he was super awkward & never cracked a smile to us, not once. My cousin asked to upgrade his meal to come with French toast, the server said okay but 10 minutes later came back and asked if a 5$ charge was okay for the French toast upgrade. Not a horrible thing, but this could have been said during the order taking because my cousin was disappointed & looked forward to having French toast. The most odd thing that happened with our server was that when we were paying (separate bills), my boyfriend's bill was $34.95, he gave the server a 50$ bill. The server then proceeded to look at the bill and ask how much my boyfriend wanted back? We all looked at the server confused by his question because I am waitress myself, and I would NEVER assume my tip or ask a customer how much change they want back. It's rude & confronting. When my boyfriend responded \"may I have everything back & we'll figure out the tip from there\" the waiter then proceeded to say \"well you gave me 50$ & the bill is 34.95$\" ...we know how much the bill was. He didn't have to repeat it. It was a VERY awkward situation, my boyfriend ended up just asking for 10$ back after being put on the spot.  I think this situation shows lack of training & common sense in their employees. I would only come back if I'm desperate for food since it's a 24 hour place."}
{"text":"Probably the worst restaurant I've been to in a long time. Very inattentive waitstaff paired with the longest waiting times I have ever seen. Not to mention the dirty glass panels by the booths. Will never be returning here. This place should be shut down. The service is inexcusable for how vacant the restaurant is and it is filthy to boot."}
{"text":"New to Toronto .. definitely could do better. Service is slow, very slow. Food was disappointing. I've been to many Denny's and if this one doesn't step up the game they're closing down for sure. All their Foursquare tips were complaints. My salmon and t-bone steak was half the size an flavour of what I'd imagine and shown on menu. I've never had to add ketchup to my fish before because it lacks that much taste. However the hashbrowns were the same as what I expected. The garlic bread was also not bad. But that's really it. The manager Joe did come at the beginnibg to see if we've been taken care of but never came back as promised after we finished eating. This is a 5/10 experience. For a franchise ... this was done ao poorly .. I hope they get better soon ...."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. Took 10 minutes to just order drinks and 35 minutes to get our food. Would be understandable if they were busy but this place was empty. Service was decent and friendly.   Don't come here if you are in a hurry or on a tight schedule."}
{"text":"David the manager (and our server that night) was the best server I've experienced in a long time, his attentive nature and warm personality was a surprising and unexpected treat during our late night Denny's run! I will return to that  specific Denny's just for David's exceptional customer service! Denny's has a real gem in David and I hope they know it!! The food was cooked to my liking and was tasty!"}
{"text":"Kudos to dennys for hiring Vesaun (sp?)!!! Amazing and friendly waitress!!! Food was alright but she made it better!!! Even complimented me on last nights glitter! :) thank you!"}
{"text":"No respect customer , very messy and service very bad . Wait for 40 mins sit and wait and watching the waiter and waitress yelling at each other and yell at customers omg  never come back here one time in my life only"}
{"text":"Dennys is a Denny's! The wait can be a little long for a seat and paying since this store is located on the strip right by the MGM and New York, New York. I had the American Grand Slam and my girlfriend blue berry pancakes. All was delivered in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"We just stopped  in this Denny's to have breakfast ... We were not seated for a couple minutes ..... Once seated we noticed there was only one waitress working ... The manager was walking around not helping her  ....No one took our drink order for almost 5 minutes .. A lady walks in sits down and the waitress took her drink order neither her nor the manager still would even acknowledge us .. This has got to be the worst service I have ever seen .. We will never visit this location ever again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Even on a Sunday morning, service was fast. 15 mins wait was really 10 mins. Server was uber nice. Menu selection was varied.  I got a fit  fair skillet..yummy!"}
{"text":"Same Ol Dennys. You can rebuild, and re model, but the Manager remains there. ;( Booo"}
{"text":"The staff is outstanding when there are only 2 people eating. the waiters seem under staffed the cook ended up bringing out the meal while the waitress checked someone out. The food was a little cold and the wait is a little bit to long."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Dennys but my family and I wanted to enjoy some early morning grub.  I've been to this location a few times in the past. Inside of the restaurant was very clean, quiet, and calm.  The a/c had to be set on blizzard because it was colder than polar bear toenails in that building lol.  Overall, the food was good and filling and the staff was nice. Definitely will visit again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The 3 of us got there at 10:40 am and told it would be only about 30 min of waiting. We didn't not get seated until11:26 am.  Luckily there were a ABC store next door to kill sometime.  We sat for another 10 min before we were greeted by the waitress, she took our order and it took them about 25 min for our food to arrived.  Service was bad and management team was unfriendly.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Avoid this location!!!! Server Maria, WORST SERVICE EVER!!  Walked in with a party of 12, sat at 3 different tables wth 2 different servers . Tables 1&2 were helped by Ulises.he was super efficient, polite and friendly! Table 3 got Maria, totally opposite! She took their order super quick, and left with their order even before the other server did ... drinks came in 15 min after table1&2 got theirs (I had to ask a diff server to check on that), their food go to the table after table 1&2 had finished their meal!!!!  She not once bother to check on table or anything..... while they were waiting  for their food I went up to the restaurant manager ( didn't get his name ) and told him the situation and he didn't seem to care . He waited about 5 min before he went back to kitchen and check on food. Even after walking back to kitchen not once he bother to come back and tell us what was going on....  Oh and did I mention order was wrong ???two of the meals ordered were incorrect and when we brought it up to Maria  she turned around and said \"OMG\".   I'm rated 2 starts only because we really liked Ulises!  Server Maria and restaurant manager are the reason the avoid this location!!!"}
{"text":"This review is only based on the dessert we had.  Which were hush puppy sundae, 1 original and 1 blackberry and chocolate lava cake.  They were all good.  The hostess (sirya) was really nice, and our waitress (sweet) was very sweet n helpful.  Service was fast and to top it off the manager (Rodney) came to the table and asked if everything was ok.  I would come back if I have a sweet tooth and if I'm in the area.  Keep up the good work night shift :)"}
{"text":"We had to wait 15 min even if there were plenty of empty tables. I got a tilapia and it was awful. Potatoes looked like 3 days old. My family got a chicken and it was decent. But it's a dennise, what to expect..."}
{"text":"This Denny's is really nice inside. Looks amazing. Service was very good, fast and prompt. Food quality is good. Restaurant looked very clean."}
{"text":"My most recent Vegas trip wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but considering how horrible it was, (sorry kiddos that I went with, it's prob not your fault) our meal at Denny's was absolutely NOT helping with the situation. Don't get me wrong, my mood absolutely does not affect my rating of this place, it was simply that bad.  Our group of five decided that we would grab a small and quick breakfast to hold off the hunger until our 2:30pm appointment with the Wynn buffet that afternoon. We woke up pretty late, and headed across the street to Denny's a little after lunchtime. Boyfriend forgot his phone in the room so we told the others to go ahead. By the time we caught up, the three of them had secured a nice table near the kitchen, it seemed like a pretty good spot. They were nice enough to wait for us to order, hopefully we didn't take too long!   So here's what happened: we were all starving, and it pretty much took at least a half hour before we were able to order/get our food. First off, we didn't have enough menus. (Didn't even get ONE copy of the cool  $2/4/6 menu that I ended up swiping from a neighboring table) Secondly, nobody brought us any water. Third, every waiter we tried to flag down STRAIGHT UP IGNORED us. Why? Because we weren't in their zone/area or whatever. Turns out we weren't even assigned a waiter, no wonder. So by the time we clear up the situation (they all kept telling us that someone else was coming, clearly  not) we were able to order. I personally have a thing against soggy potatoes so I specifically asked for my hashbrowns to be extra crispy, and they came out pasty white (okay, maybe beige. gross!) The eggs were no better, the whole meal was a huge letdown. Despite taking over 30 minutes to take our order, our check came out at the speed of light.  Left our money at the table, definitely not coming back. I realize that not everyone's experience may be this bad, but if its bad enough to be this inconsistent, it's bad."}
{"text":"Not bad. Food is OK and nice and fatty which I need sometimes. The service is lackluster mostly. Been here a couple of times and that is the case every time."}
{"text":"Couldn't order togo on the phone,  would have to go into the restaurant THEN togo than wait.  Kinda defeats the purpose."}
{"text":"What do I say about here, childhood favorite, quick, reliable, cheap, and you always know what you get here"}
{"text":"Was  in  town  for  jr golf  event  9/10/16.  Went  for  a  quick  bite  .   Busy  busy  location  but  after  a  5-10  min  wait  was  seated  ,  order  taken ,  served  quickly .   Been  to  several  Dennys  all  across  the  U S  and  this  one  had  its  sh@&  together.  Hats  off  to  the  mngr  and  staff  !"}
{"text":"I will make a long story short, I ordered the build your own burger. I asked for a beef patty and the patty was literally falling apart. It was more like a ground beef nugget burger. Shake my head! I guess they thought that slapping some cheese on top would help keep all the pieces together...FAIL. From now on, I'll be making a drive all the way down to Stapley and Baseline for a les sub par Denny's experience."}
{"text":"We had great service & our meal came pretty quickly.  The meals was hot & vertical satisfying.  Staff was very pleasant. We enjoyed eating here"}
{"text":"The glory of Denny's is a certain amount of predictability. A foodie's dream diner?! No! But a great place to get off the strip and have nice service and a decent meal."}
{"text":"I go to the College of Southern Nevada just right across the street, so naturally, I had to go try this place out. What attracted me was that because I'm a CSN student, I'm given the chance at a discount when I show my student ID. So, awesome right? Good food and at a good price. At least, so I expected.  I've gone to this Denny's a handful of times with a different set of friends, so I know that something has definitely been going down.  Just earlier today was my last visit. I went with a good friend of mine after getting out of class. The lady in the back simply said, \"Good evening, please take a seat anywhere on the right side.\" Of course, while a group of four who were probably students too were sitting in a booth on the far left. Hm, not a big deal, I guess; it wasn't busy after all.  So, we both take a seat. She hands us our menus and asks us first what we want to drink. Ten minutes later, she comes back with glasses and she takes our order, as we politely tell her thank you, and says that she'll \"have it out soon.\" So we sit back and talk. And talk. And, talk some more. Note: We had both gotten in at about approximately 6:15 PM. At 6:40, my friend and I begin to wonder what had been taking our food so long, as he loudly sipped on an empty glass of water with no waitress to refill it.  At around 6:50, she comes back and gives us our food. Imagine how cold my Smothered Cheese Fries felt when I ate it, and to my dismay, how ridiculously small the portion was for five dollars. My friend got the Biscuits and Gravy. Keep in mind, these are two very simplistic dishes; not much to add in, so why did it take so long? I wouldn't know how fast the chef cooked it, but oh, we could only guess that this waitress took centuries to get it to our table.  Not to mention, my friend was promised another glass of ice water. As soon as we finish eating, there's been no sight of her walking anywhere near or past us. We practically had to march our way over to the front area just to get the bill because we could only bet that he would've been late to his class if we didn't do it.  The previous time that I came here before tonight, the lady who gave us our check was practically harassing us with some kind of an attempt at a guilt-trip by going, \"I see you didn't leave a tip. Was our service bad?\" Oh man, I bit my tongue. You didn't know how badly I wanted to say it, too.  Another time that I had, we didn't have utensils on our table for forty minutes. Our food had come in ten minutes prior. And, not to mention, I had to stop eating just because my refill didn't come in for what felt like hours.  Still not convinced that this place is run by a nut job? My friend who I went with today overheard the waitress whispering under her breath about how \"crowded\" it was. This location is a very spacious building, but believe me, and I kid you not, there were only four other groups of people in tables aside from my friend and myself. Clearly, this woman has never seen a true lunch rush like I have, and many others.  But anywho, you want to know the moral of this story? Unless you're such a die-hard for Denny's that you don't care when you get it as long as if you get it, then save some time and DON'T go to this location. You'll wait for hours and be treated horribly as a customer, if even as a person at all.  If I didn't enjoy Denny's food so much, I would've seriously given this place a star. Maybe even zero. Never again."}
{"text":"I eat here a couple of times each week. The food is always good, as it is at Denny's across the country. The service is wonderful, and everyone is always quick and VERY nice. I love Denny's, and I'm so glad there is such a good Denny's close to my house."}
{"text":"Great for the kiddos.  Have excellent service.  Tiffany is the best waitress. She is so good to us every time we come."}
{"text":"If you are considering a Denny's or any other big-box restaurant, it's because you want an idea of what you're gonna get. Corporate menus, signage, and recipes. For a chain of this sort, this location deserves at least 4 stars.   I was staying at a friend's house, literally equidistant from four different Denny's ... this one was the south eastern one and had the highest rating on Yelp of the group (a solid 3 stars). I can see why.  This location was very clean and well staffed. The servers were prompt and courteous, even for the middle of what appeared to be a Saturday morning breakfast rush. I sat at the bar since I was dining alone and could watch them hustle-- my goodness! I ordered an ultimate omelette with no mushrooms and it came out exactly to my specifications.   I am giving this 5 stars, not because it is the best restaurant in the history of time, but because for a Denny's it is really damn good."}
{"text":"Went to eat here Friday morning with my cousin and his wife and her 11 yr old son. Waited about 20 min to be seated and the other 2 couples in our booth area had 1 thing served to them while the other person was waiting. and waiting. We ordered and when our food arrived it was cold. We asked for an extra plate and that took at least 10 minutes to come. I had a breakfast skillet and waited awhile for the pico de gallo and sour cream to come. By then my hash browns and eggs were even colder. Our waiter didnt really come by to fill up our water glasses (half the size of a normal cup) and when it was time to go the lady at the register wouldnt split our bill. She took my cousin's cash first, then put the rest on my card. Def. not going to eat here again thanks to cold food and bad service."}
{"text":"No matter what time of day we come here, there are ALWAYS server issues. Either there isn't enough help or they just got slammed with a big party and the manager is serving. Either way it's never a speedy dining experience. The food is usually good.  We arrived around 6:45 pm. There are 2 cooks, a waiter and the manager. The manager is also hosting and checking out along with waiting.   If you decide to grace them with your presence, be prepared to wait and wait and wait."}
{"text":"Our waiter Ruben was awesome! Thanks for a cup of coffee and pick me up breakfast before my road trip continued (:"}
{"text":"This place was packed... Had an understandable 15min wait, but was seated quickly in 12min and served drinks fast. Food was great too. Server was friendly. Would come back."}
{"text":"Waited 45 min just to ask for water and ended up going to the counter and asking for it myself even after asking another waitress who was not willing to be helpful not even to her coworker. I've never waited so long for service the employees were just at the register counting money or coming and going from the back ignoring customers. Talked to the manager who gave us a free shake because it was wrong too, but she seemed overwhelmed. Don't go when its busy they obviously can't handle the rush."}
{"text":"Nice new place but the wait is terrible. There's always a lot of empty tables and booths but for some reason they always make u wait. They need a manager that can put the customer first rather than to see what waitress has less customers. I can't understand that deal. If the manager cares he or she needs to get this fix ASAP. Food however is always good. Service is average."}
{"text":"Really terrible service! Do not eat here. We asked for coffee refills like 5 times and they would never bring them. We asked for hot chocolate refills and it took him 10 trips to finally remember. We didn't receive all food that came with our orders. There were a total of three pancake plates missing at the end. There was no sugar, napkins, or creamer. And they were rude to the us when it came to ordering food. Definitely NEVER coming back over here. I dont know if the guy was new, but his service was horrible we had to ask another waiter for our items, it wasn't until then that we finally got our refills and items."}
{"text":"I generally have not been overly impressed with Denny's... until now. My friends and I were in Vegas for the first time and came to eat here twice. I had the alaskan salmon dish for dinner with a side of mac and cheese and side vegetables. The salmon lacked a sauce but was prepared \"au naturel\". I have no problem with that, however. The sides were good. Had the chocolate peanut butter milkshake (New!). It was excellent and the server left a metal milkshake container with a second full refill!  Next morning, we came back for breakfast. Omelette, french toast etc. It was great. Coffee is substandard.  The service for the first meal, dinner, was extremely slow and we waited for over 45 minutes for our meal. However, the kind waitress (who actually cared deeply about customer service) wrote off like half the meal price, so no complaints.  The one subtracted star is for the unseasoned salmon and mediocre coffee. However, here is what at least half the stars are for: good and friendly service and reasonable prices. One might think that a place located on the South Strip of Vegas might try to overcharge and under-serve their customers. Not the case. With the discounted first meal showing dedication to the customer as well as the decent, healthy food I have reviewed them accordingly."}
{"text":"Ate there twice for breakfast,  waitress was ignorant,  ordered combo eggs no cheeses allergic to cheese brought back eggs with cheese. Wouldn't explain menu sat me in back private section. Brought another dish with grits half cooked. Terrible experience.  Another occasion had hair in my eggs after I almost finished breakfast made me instantly sick. Don't go breakfast bad !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Front of house looks ok. ...but the back of house (kitchen) looks dingy!! Lol, when i walked in, the cook was actually standing in the doorway of the kitchen - looking around, with his hands in his pockets. I know some people complain about everything but that little thing right there kinda turned me off!! Especially the view of the gloomy kitchen. I stated to walk out; but i grabbed to go. Not sure if i will return."}
{"text":"Don't visit or eat at this Denny's! They won't accept online coupons! Manager when asked why not, he gave an excuse that accounting won't take it. No way to honor veterans on this Memorial Day! Next time we're eating at a local restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This place has always had issues, but it seems management is just letting this place go to the dumps. The chefs and waitresses are good and the food is ok although lacking some quality control. They have a regular male customer that seems to hang out there all day every day that's real creepy. He ogles at all the female customers that walk in and out. Just creepy. He needs to find a new place to hang out. They have run out of plastic silverware packs, to-go bags etc. This place needs a full corporate inspection and some competent management."}
{"text":"Do not eat here on principle alone!!! What a horrible atmosphere; emotionally abusive owners and management!!! The owners are constantly in the store yelling at employees!!! They short there checks, refusing to fix them and even go to the extent of not paying some.  They force the waitress staff (high school students) to pay for mess-up when a customer changes their mind!  This is not acceptable!  No HR department for these employees to speak to regarding issues that have with the owners or management.   Cooks don't wear hair nots, staff is not required to wash hands and many occasions hair has been found in the food."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start... from the horrific service, the grease-laden healthy egg white omelet  or the filthy table. This has to be one of the worst eating experiences I've had in Vegas...I will not even attempt to refer to it as dining. The server was dirty, dumb and overly polite to compensate for his service short comings. The food listed as a healthy choice is anything but healthy. I ordered the egg white omelet that was so grease-laden I couldn't taste anything but dirty grease; the omelet was brown instead of what you anticipate an egg white omelet should look like. The coffee was cold, the french fries were cold, we had to ask several times for utensils, and when we received them we just asked for the check. We also noticed the 'manager' was in the kitchen expediting the orders..that is never a good sign and when we asked to speak with him, he made eye contact and seated other unknowing patrons, never returning to speak with us.   Do yourself a favor and go down the street and eat a Coco's."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a Denny's in many years.   But after traveling all day I needed food fast and cheap.  I ordered the 8 oz. sirloin steak medium well with steamed zucchini, mashed potatoes and garlic French bread ($11.99) and cheese sticks for an appetizer. To my surprise or hungry stomach it wasn't bad.  The steak was tender and juicy (could have used a pinch more seasoning).  The steam zucchini was firm and the mashed potatoes were creamy. My husband ordered a breakfast dish.  The Big Slam: eggs, toast, ham, sausage, hash browns and two pancakes.  The service was okay our waitress was pleasant but looked bored.  The restaurant was not busy and it appeared to be clean and neat (but some of the seat cushions were torn).    The waitress forgot the appetizer and I had to remind her and they came after dinner.  Because the restaurant was not busy I expected better, quicker service instead we received slow laid back service."}
{"text":"What can I say about this Denny's restaurant?  Hmm... it is your typical Denny's establishment where you can grab some cheap grub. They have a $2, $4, $6 menu where they have desserts, breakfast items, etc. at those prices. They also offer breakfast, lunch & dinner meals at various prices.  The service was decent. I went with friends on a Tuesday afternoon. The food was okay for the price. Nothing outstanding though."}
{"text":"The service is quick and friendly in the mornings.  Coffee isn't bad, the food is diner far... fresh fruit and toast with eggs, bacon etc.... all very good and served with a warm smile which is great."}
{"text":"Great spot to come after 9pm that is quick; and can be made healthy or unhealthy depending on your preference. Pancakes are fantastic as well as the chicken sausage.  Oscar was a very nice and attentive waiter."}
{"text":"Food ready early for pick up. Friendly staff. No wait time. Clean restaurant. Ordered through Grub Hub. Food still hot. Packaged good. Paid attention to substitute items from ordered menu. Would go to this Dennys again and use Grub Hub to order."}
{"text":"2nd time at this location and I've gotten the worst service ever!  People that got here 10 min after us got their food and drinks. Finished eating and paid their bill.  What is going on with this place? I informed two employees that the server may need help and we still haven't gotten any service.  Awful place ."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went there for breakfast around 8:30 on a tuesday. Waited nearly 15 mins to get a coffee., then waited another 5 mins to bring creamers. We were a group of 7, the waiter was very slow at everything. Forgot to bring waters after we asked for 5. Brought out the food after a long wait, he had no idea which person got what order. One of the orders were ordered without cheese on the eggs. It arrived with cheese!   Overall food was ok, how hard is it to mess up breakfast afterall?  2nd bad experience at a Dennys in Las Vegas this year.  It is a last option at this point"}
{"text":"Now I've eaten here before and yes I know it's Denny's so don't expect much. But this time the food was so bad we couldn't finish eating it. Hard stale biscuits, greasy bacon that couldn't be eaten and greasy potatoes. This isn't anything to do with the waitresses it's all on the cook, whom should get fired! The Manager needs to have the regional and district ones come pay her a visit."}
{"text":"The smell! Came here late at night because of limited options but the overpowering smell ran my family out! Restaurant smelled like musty mold! Never come here!"}
{"text":"clean restaurant, fast service, waitress was nice, food served fast and hot, no complaints here  Pilar gave great service, very friendly"}
{"text":"It's after 9pm, you're in Scottsdale and you are hangry!  There are very few options for a nice sit-down restaurant but thank goodness there's a Denny's!  Feeling like filling up your tummy on just a few bucks?  Try the all-you-can-eat pancakes for only $4!  Seriously?  Shove syrup dripping carb-cakes in your mouth for hours and hours and hours for less than a fast food meal!  Their internet is relatively slow, but usable.  Not looking to stuff your face like there's no tomorrow?  Order off the $2-$4-$6-$8 options for plenty of food for just a few bucks.  Might I recommend the Quesadilla?  Get the salsa and sour cream to finish it off."}
{"text":"Well it's Sunday at the truck stop..! Wow it so busy today. People  and families with kids everywhere. And here that r big families , lol.  So we got seated but had to wait jus a bit so they could clear tables. Our waiter was a nice young male. Good server. He was keeping up pretty well he always had r water and checked with us often as he breezed by. I had Spaghetti which I love here at Denny's. Good flavor. I wanted something substantial cause a team run tonite! Boyfriend had burger avo and bacon and salad. It was quick for as many people in there and GOOD. No pix was stuffing my pie hole this time. Gotta run!"}
{"text":"From the States ..  we came in for quick dinner. Soup n salad and Turkey club $8 meal with side salad. Service was ok. Although here they do not come around for drink refills much. Guess we drink a lot more. Broccoli cheddar soup is always good and so are the salads. Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I love this location because it's rather secluded and is mostly popular with seniors. That means fewer screaming children. As far as food goes, I have always been served exactly what I ordered, hot and absolutely delicious. The \"Moons over my Hammy\" is my favorite meal, though their chicken fried steak is amazing  also. Don't forget about their shakes ! The peanut butter one is amazing and worth the money"}
{"text":"Medium quality food. Waiters are nice and the place after all is clean."}
{"text":"Around 4 am my boyfriend and I were looking for food. It was New Years so we figured if we called dennys ahead of time we could get it quicker and get home to bed. He parked and went in while I stayed in the car. Half an hour later he still wasn't back I decided to go in and sit with him. It was really crowded and the hostess was slammed with customers trying to pay their bills. 10 minutes later when the rush calmed down the server, Michelle asked us where we wanted to sit. My boyfriend explained that he came to pick up our order almost an hour ago. She somehow didn't believe him and had him show her his phone record of the call. I was so irritated/tired I got up and asked him who was working when he came in and he nodded to Michelle. She had to reorder for us and we were made to wait more. She came back after talking to the manager and handed us a receipt and two 20% off coupons. We figured the meal was free. Nope. After another 10 minute wait our food was finally ready and Michelle made us use one of the coupons she JUST gave us. Never again."}

{"text":"This is a really nice Denny's. Sounds weird but it is. Drinks are very reasonable. Bacon bloody Mary is only $7. It's super clean and the workers are all really friendly. They have outdoor seating available and a decent sized bar. There's a nice inside area to eat at that is all windows which is spot on to eat/drink and ppl watch."}
{"text":"We had an early lunch (the club hit the spot!) and we received great service from Shay.  We sat at the counter and can attest that she is a team player in every way...saw her plate food, run food, communicate with her manager about tables and just generally hustle. Which was great since the place was surprisingly packed. The missing star was for the host that had no idea what tables were open so a big line occurred which mingled with the people trying to pay because he seemed to be doing it by himself. The server that was reading the menu to someone on the phone and then just saw the line and walked away. An acknowledgement or a \"hey guys I'm going to go get someone to help out up here\" would have been nice."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for mediocre food. Pretty sure they left the egg off my sandwich too... Save yourself and go to iHop."}
{"text":"I've never waited so long for food poisoning. Came into this location to be sat between to extremely loud cursing family's, ordered a grand slam and received my order 50 minutes after ordering. Food poisoning the next 2 days, will not return."}
{"text":"Our favorite Denny's. The restaurant is always very clean and neat, the service is amazing. Their food is well prepared and always really yummy. We never had a bad experience there and consider ourselves regulars. We will be there again soon!"}
{"text":"Great place! People are always friendly. Service is great! And hands down the best slow cooked pot roast I have ever had! You have to try it!!"}
{"text":"Denny's is crap most of time anymore but this location is hit and miss and when you hit it, it's good. My last meal the manager was very cool and checked on us often making sure we liked the food and all. My soda was never left unfilled. On other visits the manager has been lousy, doesn't check on tables and customer after customer complains resulting in some sort of compensation with the bill. If only the lousy manager could learn something from the good one. IHOP tastes better to me but a few times a year I get a late night craving for breakfast and with the $2, $4, $6 and $8 meals it's usually worth it. Parking can be cramped during the however late at night it's better."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place For a while now but the service keeps getting worse and worse.  After walking out on two occasions, decided to give them a third chance. It took 10 minutes just to order drinks, couple of minutes later they brought the drinks and asked for our order again.   The staff fights in front of the customers and it seems like everyone is having a bad day, definitely regret the decision."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and was seated right in front of the kitchen area so we spent the entire meal watching the servers yell at the kitchen staff for mistakes with their order. I've never witnessed such a zoo in a restaurant.  Then we get the worst waitress we've ever had. Took a long time to take our order and then after a long wait I seen them put our food on the counter ready to be delivered to our table where it sat for almost 15 minutes. Our waitress walked by our food 10 times and I finally blew up and told her to get our food now. She started apologizing and said \"I've been watching your food sit up there but thought someone else was going to run it to you since I was busy at the cash register\".  She wasn't busy at the cash register, she kept walking right by our food and messing around behind the counter.  It was ice cold and my wife kept telling me to send it back but I just wanted to get out of there and did not want to wait for more food.   As we were paying she said \"I'm having an off night, don't be mad at me\" and gave me 15% off our meal.  Will never support this place again."}

{"text":"The food was great, the waitress/hostess  /cashier Ty was absolutely fantastic and extremely polite. Everything was correct with our order and she kept our glasses full! I was not a fan of Dennys but I totally am! Worth the drive"}
{"text":"We decided to order Denny's for delivery last night because the last time we did, everything was great. This time, not so much. Our delivery time changed 3 times. When our food finally got to us, it had been almost two hours (extremely late from any of the arrival times we were told). Food was cold. They had called me and said they had to charge for extra cheese which was fine. Until I got my food. Picture attached is considered \"extra cheese\" to them."}
{"text":"Wow. How did I forget to review this one?  Have eaten here at least a couple hundred times over the years. The past couple years the food and service has been really good. In the past, it was a border-line gag and puke...but with the management and server changes a couple years ago has been decent."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place, it's your typical Denny's restaurants.  It's open 24 hours a day, so it's good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  You can order breakfast food during night time and dinner during day time.  They don't care what time it is, they will fill you up anyway they can get.  Also, they offer free birthday meal, just show up and let them know it's your birthday and they'll pay for your meal, easy like that."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant! I especially love the $2, $4, $6, $8 menu- makes eating out with 5 kids and 3 adults affordable! Clean facility, food is good, and service is always friendly! When we decide to go out for breakfast, this is always the place we can all agree on!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  For breakfast, brunch, lunch or dessert! Very clean and cozy atmosphere with big table booths. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the Apple Cranberry Chicken salad. When the waitress brought the order she mentioned they are out of apples. This is a major component of this dish. I no longer wanted it but it.was too late to order anything else (I was part of a party of 3). They took off $2 from the bill (could they spare it?) and I had.to ASK for that."}
{"text":"I don't go to Denny's with high expectations. The one by my house in South Akron keeps those expectations in check. But this one is by far the worst Denny's I've ever seen.  The service wasn't friendly. The food was horribly slow at over 45 minute wait for two plates of brekky at 10:05... Make that 10:54am. The coffee wasn't refilled once during that 50 minute wait. The food was served at room temperature, 50 minutes later, partially dry. Well, my daughter's was. Mine took another ten minutes, and was fresh and piping hot. I enjoyed eating it with my already sticky, dirty fork. I'm not going to let this experience deter me from visiting other Denny's in the future."}
{"text":"This dennys is by far the worst place to go have a meal at any time of the day! I've been there a few times with my family and all 3 times I said I'll never eat there again (only went back because it's literally 2minutes away from us) but now I swear they won't get another dime from me... The food takes FOREVER and never looks or taste good ,it reminds me of one of those 1.99 breakfast places that nobody care about the crappy food because it's so cheap but it not! There's always dirty tables just sitting there with no intentions on being cleaned until they have no choice but to clean so a guest can be seated and even then they take the customer to a table that is clearly dirty only to make them stand there awkwardly while waiting for it to be cleared . But most of all the servers are just awful,never smile,never friendly and usually look a hot mess to say the least, like they just fell out of bed  and they always have bad attitudes as if they Aren't there to be waiting on you when in fact that's the only reason they're there. Not sure what's going on with that place but I'm guessing that's why there parking lot is always empty.  My family and I will not be going there again EVER no matter how close it is,we'll travel elsewhere from now on for sure!"}
{"text":"Yesterday  morning we stopped and had GREAT FOOD and amazing service from DONNA!! She is great nice lady!!"}
{"text":"This place gets crazy busy so have patience and you will be seated soon. Our server was Izzat and he did a great job providing great service and was up beat under the craziness of this place. Kids had a good time!"}
{"text":"maybe i should have read the single 1-star review of this Denny's before having breakfast here on Sunday morning.   maybe that's all i need to say.  but i'll say more.  the last time i went to the Denny's (off Rockside in Independence) my time was pretty enjoyable. this place is the worst. some is within their control, and some may not be.  when i order a cup of coffee (or a cup of anything, for that matter) it'd be nice to get a clean cup. mine was delivered to me with coffee spilled all over it. i'm not sure if these were fresh spills or had been there for some time. it might also be nice of a restaurant to actually hire wait staff who know how to communicate. if your server applicant isn't, for some reason, capable of opening her mouth to speak, maybe she should be dealing with your customers. of course i could hear her perfectly when she cussed under her breath about the other table nex to us and threw plates into the bus tub. and speaking of that other table. if your servers/wait staff don't want to deal with them, how's about your don't make your paying clientele have to deal with them either. these people were so annoying and trashy. the kids wouldn't stop screaming, crying and coughing. the parents couldn't be bothered to pay the children any attention. they basically cleared the entire area we were sitting in - the other customers quickly ate and left - shaking their heads.  oh, and the food was kinda gross also, but then again, maybe i'd just lost my appetite.  should have stayed in the 'wick and gone to Gyro George's."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. First off, it's my birthday and I'm in a different state, so we decided before we head back to Vegas let's get some breakfast..... well, we went to Denny's and it was really slow in there. We were sat, 3 adults 1 child, waited for 10 minutes and no one even came by to give us a drink. Needless to say I was not waiting any longer. We walked out and went across the street to Village Inn instead to get my birthday breakfast."}
{"text":"Denny's has always been my drunken guilty pleasure. There's just something about the greasy diner food that hits the spot so a location on Fremont Street is perfect!  I stumbled upon Denny's while looking for a spot to grab a late night bite to eat and I was immediately sold. I asked for an order to-go and told the hostess that I had about 15 minutes before I needed to be back at the limo for my ride back to the Strip. She assured me that she would tell the kitchen to put a rush on the order and, sure enough, it was ready in plenty of time.   As I was looking at the menu, I noticed that the infamous seasoned fries were missing. Instead, there was a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. But I asked the hostess and she confirmed with the kitchen that they do still carry the seasoned fries. I'm not sure why they're not listed on the menu but I really hope that Denny's never gets rid of them. They are my favorite!   The seasoned fries paired perfectly with my bacon-less Super Bird and the hostess even threw in two containers of ranch (score!). The Super Bird tasted so incredible that I've been busy trying to recreate it at home for lunch all week. Definitely one of my favorite sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Always friendly always clean always a good price. Senior meals certain days kids eat free, 20% off between two and five for seniors. Staff& waitresses very friendly and will even dance for you!"}
{"text":"We were tired of the poor service at the Denny's Craig Rd and Valley so we decided to go up to the Craig and Tenaya location and so happy that we did! Moses the manager was right on top of helping his outstanding waiter, Adan, keeping glasses full, plates away and being attentive without being intrusive!     The restaurant was very clean, welcoming atmosphere and we will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"The food was good, however, the pricing is way too high for what you get. Liked that the waitress kept checking on us every so often and refilling the coffee (went during the week, around 11am so it wasn't busy). The lighting in the place wasn't very good, it's very dark at the Dixie location.  Wish they could add additional lighting or make the place bright for breakfast instead of dark and gloomy."}
{"text":"So I came in for dinner around 6:10pm we were seated right away and attended shortly after for drinks. It was 6:25pm We had not decided what to eat and the server was patient but not consistent. After we had ordered which I got the bourbon burger it was not worth the wait first I didn't get asked how I wanted my burger whether if i wanted rare or well done. On top of that the appetizer we got which were the loaded tater tots it came out looking burnt and just everything thrown in the bowl with no respect for presentation. We had to constantly ask for refills and still as I'm writing this review we have not been attended to. When our food came it took almost 20 minutes and it was only us and one other table so no reason to say it was busy but when we did get our food they forgot my daughters bread with her spaghetti and also my fries looked like they were burnt also they were stuck together as if they were left in the fryers basket. We now have been sitting here since 6:50pm that's 20 minutes without refills asked about dessert or if we would like the check I would say this is why I don't come to Denny's for this reason exactly also there are no signs in the men's restrooms for employees to wash there hands which I know is a health code violation. It is now 7:11pm and still nothing this is the worst experience I can not believe I am having!!! We left at 7:17pm after I had to go up and ask for a manager to get the check and complain about the whole situation and the manager was the other server which showing her apologies was asking if my daughter wanted a dessert for free and taking my daughters meal off the bill sorry but never coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay. Went there for my birthday a few months ago. Got a gouda cheese burger and fries. I knew that it was going to be super cheesy but it soaked the bun and half my fries. We didn't have a whole lot of money at the time but my hubby still wanted to take me for a birthday dinner. I wouldn't say we were disappointed but I expected a lot better ."}
{"text":"The lines at Tacos El Gordo were too long so we decided to just eat at this Denny's. Bad choice. It was New Year's Day but the place was dead. Only one other table of customers besides us. A guy came to our table and took our drink and food order and never returned. We went 35 minutes with no drinks or acknowledgement. The manager had time to clean a window partition yet couldn't find the time to get us our drinks or even just acknowledge us. We were sat in the far corner so I couldn't see the kitchen but the manager seated us and the guy cooking took our order so they knew we were there. Finally I decided we would leave and go to a different location. I walked over to the kitchen to tell the manager we were leaving. She said \"oh wait I'll cook your food right now\" and I told her to forget it. I mean they were only going to start cooking our food because I said we were leaving. She never once said sorry or showed any type of sympathy to the situation they put us in. She  had no issue with us leaving and could have cared less."}
{"text":"Never even sat down after waiting 20 minutes. Two of the hosts were so rude and rolling their eyes at customers. We decided after the third or fourth eye roll we didn't even want to wZit longer. After we were told that there was 5-10 minute wait."}
{"text":"The last few times we went, it was well over an hour to receive our food. It was pretty empty both times. My daughter had Mac and cheese the first time, but  it must have been sitting out for a while before getting to the table. It was stuck to the plate. My garden burger was very puck-like.   The second time, we both had breakfast for dinner. It took about 20 for someone to take our order. Once the order was placed, our waitress came over and said her shift was done and someone else will wait in us. About 45 minutes later, we still didn't have food. I had to go up to the counter to ask about it. It arrived shortly later, everything cold. Offered no apologies or anything. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a great Denny's! I was skeptical when I first tried it, but this location is clean, the service is great and food is well prepared & fresh when it matters. And don't forget, kids eat free on Tuesdays and Thursdays."}
{"text":"ADRIEL is AWESOME... He was our Host,  Waiter/Server and cashier It's amazes me why he's not a manager...   I have been to Denny's across the Vegas valley and even though the location is on the East Side of town, I've had great service...  I counted 4 workers on dinner shift... 1 cook, 1 bus man & 1 waiter, 1 waitress...  The cook was fast and when I say fast I mean I waited 15 mins TOP for my food... Hot and fresh! Needless to say, I was impressed The bus guy,  waited for customers to clear table and he was on it...  & Adriel, exceptional service, very efficient & attentive not only to us but all of his tables... didn't pay to much mind to the waitress but also had quite a bit of tables... He has the definition of \"Customer Service\" (something las vegas lacks)  Kudos to Adriel, if any of his managers read this, please give him a promotion and acknowledgement because he surely deserves it as well as the cook and bus guy... I would definitely be back and this will now be my home Denny's lol"}
{"text":"If you come late at night they are really under staffed so the service sucks. On top of the service being bad the night crew isn't very nice. I've lived on This side of town for 22+ years and have attempted to come to this location a few times and each time has been worse than the last.  The food and prices are excellent. Serve horrible.    Side note: day time breakfast hour everything is excellent, anything past midnight I don't suggest."}
{"text":"When I go there I usually get my food to go. Almost every time they mess up my order. One time they packed my hot soup containers in the wrong containers so it spilled all over my car because they melted, another time they forgot to pack half my food and there is just so many other experiences that I still thought I could tolerate since it's 2 minutes from my house. A couple of days ago I placed an order for pick up how I usually do.  I got there to pick it up and after she had run my card and made me sign for it she told me she didn't have what I order and that she could give me something else instead I polity replied \"no thank you I'm going to need a refund\" and she told she couldn't give me my money back, when I got upset  and I told her that she needed to give me what I paid for otherwise I needed a refund she told to come back and talk to her manager (such an inconvenient solution) NOT GOING BACK THERE I'll rather drive an hour than to deal with them!!!!"}
{"text":"It has been 2 years since I came back to this place.  I usually come here just for my free birthday meal.  It's not a fancy place, but I just came to hang out with my friends.  Tonight's server was great, she's very attentive and very helpful.  I would definitely come back here again soon."}
{"text":"Yeah, rating a Denny's at four stars is brave, however the restaurant in question has consistently performed exceptional, especially the waitresses. Most of all I like the idea that I can get grits here, and even though more often than not, they are \"instant\", I haven't been disappointed yet. The worse thing you can do to grits besides serving cold and lumpy, is too watery/soupy. Anyway, this Denny's is the \"Diner\" style with the red and I think white decor. For basic coffee, Denny's is hard to beat. I do have to clarify that I only go to Denny's for breakfast food. As for the other stuff on the menu, all I can say is at least the service will be good."}
{"text":"Sounds me to that if the management and servers remember your face from previous encounters of never being able to satisfy you. Keeping the server running around for you and never expecting to even leave a tip. Then I would of agreed with management that we can't full fill your needs so maybe go and try to experience another family diner that can better accommodate you. Dennys has great service no matter the situation."}
{"text":"Nice family and friend place to go restaurant.  Always get cheerful waitresses and good service. Not a five star restaurant, but definitely a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Attempted to have breakfast at this location today (10/14/17) with a family Of 6, the following excuses were used: 1. I work night shift so I can't find the coffee pots 2. Your ticket got lost between the waitress and kitchen 3. We aren't sure what happened, let me find out. - The lady never came back to tell us what actually happened. 4. We went to the cashier to finally get re-fills on our coffee.  An hour after arriving we still weren't served and left without eating.  We will never return to this location again. Welcome To the West Valley indeed!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Denny's that I've ever patronized.  I go here because my mother likes the food, which by the way is actually pretty good.  However, the customer service is horrible.  On each of my last 4 visits, either the service was extremely slow or they didn't bring out everything I ordered.  There is always a problem and the manager (young AA male who I assume is still there) doesn't like to give discounts or even try to fix the problem.  On one occasion, the regional manager heard us complaining when leaving the restaurant and offered us a free meal on our next visit.  She  actually said that this manager was \"afraid of his own shadow and was new.\" When we went back, the manager called her and she denied offering us a free meal.  The manager argued me down about it, so I just offered to pay.  At that time, he gave it to me free.  But by that time, I was so frustrated that it didn't even matter and the bill was only $20. I don't plan on going back, unless my elderly mother asks me to take her."}
{"text":"We used to go to this Denny's and then the service was so bad we stopped.  Had breakfast today and the new management has whipped this restaurant into shape.  The service is great thank you."}
{"text":"Slow service. Took a hour to get our food. Only two people. Bad attitude. Asked for decaf coffee but received regular coffee. Don't go there. Don't waste your money. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"Had a pleasant Fathers Day Dinner at this Denny's. We were promptly seated at our table and our drink orders were taken quickly. Our server, Jordan was amazing! She was very kind and understanding when she gave me a few extra minutes to order (I'm a picky eater) while she grabbed the drinks. Our food did take a while but it was understandable since there was quite a few people. Loved the experience and the food was made just right."}
{"text":"I just love it when Stephanie's their working. She always goes all the way with their positive outgoing attitude I will visit this restaurant whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"The honey jalape√±o bacon is really good, but it took 40 minutes to get breakfast and a heavy wet ceiling panel fell onto my brother's head. That wasn't too good. On the good side, I guess, you get $3.00 or so off a 7 person check for the inconvenience.  Be careful where you sit. Later we saw all the restaurant guests standing outside in the parking lot."}
{"text":"First of all I want to say that I agree with everyone that parking was difficult to find. However, that was not my main problem. When my boyfriend and I walked in we were seated and given drinks almost immediately which was nice, but once our food was served we began to notice issues. First, our waited gave us our order incorrectly even after we had repeated it back to him. Second, we were charged incorrectly for an item that was not given to us. Thirdly, we were charged tax on each separate order as well as well as the grand total (even though we paid on one bill). To be completely honest, it wasn't horrible service, but I say that only because I was in a very good mood at the time. The waiter kept trying to justify his mistakes rather than fix them. The place is just over priced and the staff needs some training."}
{"text":"Went here to recover the day after my birthday, the service was overall okay. There was a mix up with who was going to be our server & we were really confused but they figured it out. We didn't see our waitress much so we didn't get everything we needed, but thought she might of been new to the position? The food was okay, waited so long to get my toast that it was hard but she gave us free pancakes for that. The service considering our waitress was 'new' was okay. Their water is really gross though, they should really fix that."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast, not for anything else. Disappointed twice. Got a chicken sand which once and the bun just  completely apart so couldn't eat it. Thought it was a bad batch of buns. Second time we got a burger and the bun fell completely apart again, so didn't eat it. They really need to change that up and surprised if no one else complains about it. Service is good."}
{"text":"The service was great but my patty melt was so greasy I couldn't eat it. I literally could squeeze the grease out of it. I'll never go back! Management said I ate too much to get my money back! I took 1 bite!!"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice. Air conditioner is not working, super busy. While waiting people were calling in to see how long the wait is the girls up front were saying tell them three hours so they won't come in. We were sweating in the booth and asked the manager about the air he said I don't know we can't get it to come on. ...... I am not impressed waitress walked by with the coffee pot and did not fill my cup that is sitting on the edge of the table empty... : (  husband is getting overheated may not even be able to stay to eat, we have been here at least 45 minutes no food no ac...."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Denny's in all the land!!! Really no joke! I have been here several times each different times of day, for example it is 11:45 am on a Thursday and only 7 tables in the restaurant are occupied. It took almost 20 minutes to be seated and almost as long to place an order and the food took forever to come out. If you're not in a hurry this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"We had EXCELLENT service from Sean!!! Thank you! I am very funny about my milkshake and he got it perfect! He was fast and good with all of our requests!"}
{"text":"Food was good ...waitress sucked ...\"Ellery\" was ours...to be honest the entire waitress staff was awful. The guy in front of me while paying had a completely different waitress and refused to leave a tip. And the customer behind me was complaining as well about the horrible service.  Crazy thing is it was not even busy in the slightest and half a dozen waitresses standing around doing nothing. For me it doesn't matter how good the food is if the overall experience sucks."}
{"text":"I went on Sunday for eggs benny and hash browns ...  it was a typical busy Sunday at 11:30am.  However, once we got seated, we got served quickly.  Food was great.  So, today I was in the area, craving some \"more\" eggs benny and hashbrowns, so I popped in.    TODAY (Tuesday, September 29th) at 1:30pm.  I got my food LESS THAN 5 MINUTES after my order was taken.  Yes - less than 5 actual minutes.  (I was reading an article on my cell phone, that's how I know the times).    Same delish food, amazingly fast service.  I always love the shredded hashbrowns and I especially like that they have a HALF order of eggs benny - this is what I order.  (My other favorite is the Moons Over My Hammy ...  which \"used\" to be able to come in a half order).  I will continue to come back to Dennys - various locations.  This one is very convenient to me.  Good job Donna (today's server) and staff."}
{"text":"Denny's on Sahara is one of the best Denny's , and I've eaten at Denny's actoss the U.S.A.. Thete was two excellent waitress', Katiee  very professional and personalble. Fay was very attentive to our needs. J.R. is usually the cook there and he pays attention to every detail. But tonight there was a different cook -Louis. He didnt have a clue of what anyone wanted. But with those two waitress' it worth every penny you will have to pay. They are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Dennys. Man I came here every birthday with my family, I loved the chocolate shakes, and how they brought you the extra in the metal shaker was awesome. But I started to realize the food wasn't the same as it used to be, maybe it was just some cook that day, but I have tried other breakfast cafes and I like trying new places that seem to have a more personal, maybe family run feeling to the business. It's good, but I go elsewhere nowadays."}
{"text":"Stopped in after an exhausting day/night on the strip.   Good service, good food."}
{"text":"After a closing shift this is the place to go for decent inexpensive food :-)   the servers are great, especially CHAD!!! makes the best HOT CHOCOLATE & \"MAKE YOUR OWN\" shakes :-)"}
{"text":"OMG !!!! Horrible place!  Waiter and manager coughing and hacking sick as can be...waiting on tables...disgusting!  Mgr. Was argumentative and kept talking about his other job at the Palazzo being better, while at our table, which made us feel he obviously didn't care about working at a lowly Denny's as he made it seem. All around horrible experience, they've been going downhill for some time now down there, and if that's the \"management\" they choose for their food establishment, then I'm sorry to say but that's a shame entirely..."}
{"text":"I love this denny's I wouldnt go to any other  our usual waiter angel is probably the best waiter ive ever had and the food is delicious its better than any other denny's ive gone to in the past"}
{"text":"30 minutes for an order of the pancake puppies! Always really slow but I dont think is the service is just a slow kitchen I guess"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Sunday breakfast, walked in the place is extremely dirty. They even sat us at a dirty table. Then to top it all off, there was a hair on top of my pancakes as soon as she set them down. I didn't even want to eat anymore. Then when we went to pay we were told to go up to the cashier and tell her that the waitress said there was a hair in our food and to give us a discount. I can now never go back to Denny's. :/"}
{"text":"Food is standard like you would get in any other Denny's across the country. It's open 24/7 and literally nothing feels better than hot breakfast when your feet are hurting after clubbing, you're famished and tipsy. The service was good and even those early hours the server was very nice and pleasant while taking our orders."}
{"text":"So where to start ... Well, I just got off work and the Hubs and I decided we wanted to grab something to drink and maybe some breakfast so we by passed our usual spot and drove here since we are new to the neighborhood and this one is near our home. First of all the place was dirty. Dirty tables, trash on the carpet and not many people inside. Since I wanted to wash my hands I found the ladies room and WOWSA!  It was filthy , no toilet paper and soap. I sure hope the help has their own place to wash up before they cook and serve the customers! While we were seated all I could hear was the servers complaining about who was leaving and breaks.  We heard someone come in after us and loudly announce \" Is this the best you can do?\"  when he was seated. They placed him by some shady people. Even we were seated by the table where they fold napkins by there was other booths open.  We finally had our order taken and the food came out quickly and was decent BUT we wanted a refill on the coffee.  I had a pleasant conversation with my Mr. and he finally had enough so we got up to leave. Here comes the best part. We walked to the cashier , she asks rudely for the check. We told her we never got one and that we waited for it and refills but got neither. She ignored it and asked for the table we sat at. Obviously she doesn't care about customers and what they have to say. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and asked if there was manager and all she could say was $14.52. That was the total for our bill. I asked again and without even looking at me ,reaching her hand out for our payment she finally told me there isn't one. Not until 6am. So needless to say I told her I guess you don't care about customer service. She didn't bat an eyelash. We will not be back. Even if this is in my neighborhood we won't give it the time of day. I will choose someplace else that is more pleasant and cares about how their customers are treated and welcomes them back. Very disappointed. Don't bother with this location. Try anyplace else. I give it  ZERO rating but it won't let me choose that."}
{"text":"Came here for the free birthday dishes. We enjoyed our meal, the server was nice. It wasn't very busy, which made it even better. Just the right amount of food!"}
{"text":"Extremely bad experience just got done ordering the birthday cake pancakes and extremely grossed out they look like cum cakes! Why? I think I always expect more but never again! I think this restaurant is as gross as McDonald's!"}
{"text":"I have this thing for patty melts.  There was a lounge by my office that made a darn good one, but then they stopped serving food.  I've been driving by this Denny's for I-don't-know-how-long and kept thinking, \"Hmmm...  I've gotta try their patty melt.\"  So I did.  Ruben answered the phone - very nice phone voice and very pleasant in person too!  Happily changed my cheese from swiss to American (I just needed some ooey, gooey, melty cheese that day).  Ruben was waiting for me when I arrived with a smile on his face and my patty melt ready to go.  It was sooo good!  The rye was warm and toasty (which is difficult to maintain when you get it \"to go\"), the burger cooked perfectly with grilled onions.  When I saw the fries, I thought, \"What the heck are these?\".  They were kinda big and shaped like a tin roof (not rusted - sorry, Love Shack reference).  I was afraid they were gonna be soft, but they were actually well cooked.  So I ate them too.  Better prices than the other breakfast joint close by that also serves burgers, and better burger.  Way to go Dennys!  I'll be back (I'm sure you can guess the reference on this one)."}
{"text":"We loved eating here while staying in Vegas a few weekends ago.  A guy named Jesus, he goes by \"Jesse\" served us every time we went and he was amazing - attentive and made sure we got exactly what we wanted. He made amazing custom salads for us and we're thankful for preparing fresh, healthy meals for us.   Jesse should probably be running that place, he is fast and knows what he's doing."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  My toast came out 30 minutes late with a reminder and it was burnt. My friend asked for all bacon and no sausage, the plate came out with all sausage. Scrambled eggs were still runny.   Worst Denny's experiencing ever!"}
{"text":"I wanted to have a alcoholic drink in the only Denny's I know of to have a bar. I waited for service for about 15 minutes. Not one single waitress acknowledged me at all. It was not busy. I understand you get more tips from a group of people ordering food but I would think that if you want more business you would at least say hi, how may I help you to everyone that walks into your restaurant. I don't like Denny's food at any location and I definitely don't recommend this location for anything."}
{"text":"Gross! Just got done eating and we will not be back. My plate had a hair curly hair on it. No, it wasn't on the food, but gross! My bacon was so hard I thought I was going to chip a tooth eating it. My husband's eggs were raw. I understand Denny's is cheap, but that doesn't mean it has to awful.   I will say the service was good."}
{"text":"Went for my bday; waitress at 7am was great! Wished me happy bday, friendly; got my free meal with no hassles; that was first time there and since waitress was so nice and service good, have been there several times after;"}
{"text":"This is where the posse decided to eat after a night of dancing and drinking. There were 30 of us and we all stumbled in at around 3 AM.  The location wasn't super busy but there were definitely a few groups in the joint. Despite our insanely large and insanely incoherent group, our server handled us like a true professional.  Our server didn't lose her cool once. Not even when buddy at the end of the table decided to change his order...3 different times.  I'm not gonna lie: we were definitely a high-maintenance group and despite this fact, our server was friendly, efficient, pleasant, helpful and patient.  I have to give mad props to this location of Denny's for having us. We may not have been on our best behaviour, but you guys sure as hell were! Thank you for putting up with us - GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here with my family and all was good until it was time to eat. I noticed my spoon wasn't clean, good thing for me I didn't need a spoon to eat my breakfast, but it was very disgusting knowing my silverware wasn't properly cleaned. Most likely will not be coming here again. It's very unfortunate, because the food was VERY delicious."}
{"text":"Denny's   FOOD: 3.5 stars TLDR: slightly cold eggs, dry patty, great gravy  Ordered the american slam and the avacado bacon burger. American slam includes scrambled eggs topped with cheese, sausages, bacon and hash. Sadly the cheese wasn't melted enough, sausage was fine and bacon was ok, but not as bad as other reviews claim. It's breakfast, and pretty comparable to other breakfast place, not amazing but not crap either.  The avocado bacon burger wasn't the best burger either. The patty was dry, topping fresh, taste was good, i liked it but i think i prefer bacon cheese burger more.  One thing i have to say though is their gravy taste pretty good, though slightly towards the doughy side, it's always good to have good gravy for fries.  SERVICE: 4 stars TLDR: Service was good, not understaffed, probably need to fix kitchen.  Most of the negative reviews were because of the service. We went in and the place was packed, the hostess told us there was a 20 min wait and decided to wait. We got our table within the predicted time and the server came promptly. The server was very nice and kind. The order took a but of time though, but it wasn't maddening. As a server, I'm pretty sure they're well staffed in the front, though i see the servers are rarely on the floor, so something is definitely happening in the back. Feels like they need a faster more efficient cook line. All this, along with the lack of heat in the food leads me to believe that the problem is most probably from the kitchen. As soon as that's dealt with, I believe the place would run way smoother.  LOCATION/AMBIANCE: 3.5 stars TLDR: New place, new reno, old style.  Newly built, so they place is really clean. I feel that because they're trying to retain their brand image, the renovation was older in style than they should with a new location. O wells   PARKING: 3 stars TLDR: not enough spots in front, and most of the time parking is full.  The restaurant is located in the front of the plaza with very few spots to park in the front. There are more parking spots at the back but it's almost always full when i go, so I usually have to wait for a bit for a spot.   PRICE: 3 stars The price is a reasonable breakfast place comparable to that of clora's. No special early dine deals, and i feel they are slightly over priced for the food."}
{"text":"Saturday 11am late breakfast. I had a patty melt, hubby had chicken fried steak and eggs. Server was friendly and efficient. Lots of loud children and large groups. What I noticed is that the busser who cleaned the table near us from a large group never swept or picked up the debris from the floor. A knife, napkin and various food remained when the next group were seated. They never noticed but we did. I looked under our table when we left, gross. Glad I didn't notice before I ate. Standards are not good enough. Food was average."}
{"text":"Cynthia the waitress was lousy My pie was burnt and small and my significant other food was lousy also and the waitress had a horrible attitude customer service and industry. Mary was excellent she deserves a 5-star rating. Mary is ahead of the waitresses"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas and looking for a Denny's for breakfast off of the strip-- hoping that there wouldn't be a long wait. The restaurant is part of Days Inn and through a small and old casino. The hotel looks scary. They ask you if you have a coupon for free breakfast from the hotel. I could never stay at such a place but to each his/her own. The waitress was nice and food wasn't bad. Just not the greatest location. Parking lot was also packed."}
{"text":"BUY ONE GET ONE MIMOSAS ARE A MUST!  I usually sit at the bar since it pretty packed in the house. Servers at the bar including the lady manager, I think her name is Janet or Jessica, super amazing ! Food dosnt take long, I go to Denny's pretty frequently and there's always coupons or veterans discount !"}
{"text":"Here's the thing - the food here is mediocre and has a certain taste that I can't understand. They are always trying new food combinations but it always feels kind of processed no matter what you order.   BUT, I look forward to coming here regularly because of the staff.   I've only been here late night - think from 11pm to 6am. Every time I can't get over how accommodating, friendly, and warm the staff are, even when it's busy and the place is packed.   Their service level is what I might expect at a much nicer place, and I'm always pleased even going in now with the high expectations that their staff are great. If I come just with a laptop for a couple hours and order something small they treat me with just as much regard as when I come and order a large meal.  (They do sometimes take a while to seat people lately at night I've noticed even when they aren't full, but in general their excellence makes up for it.)  Also, I like the atmosphere. You get people from all walks of life late night and they play really basic but kind of fun music which is extra loud in the bathroom and it just feels like going out for a fun night with friends, even if it's just a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Long wait to be seated, served COLD coffee !!! Waitress very nice, food good, ok. \"New\" coffee sucks !!"}
{"text":"Yes! the poor man's Vegas breakfast  30mn wait to get called. we were honnngry! They had many choices. I think i built my own breakfast (a side of pancake, eggs, bacon, grits).  Some people at my table weren't happy with their choices but to me it was decent. It got me full.   I liked their cool variety of drinks (like that hybrid pink pepsi, peach smoothies)"}
{"text":"I finally made a Yelp account, just to leave a positive comment about this specific location of Denny's. Me and my husband have consistently been eating here for about a year now. We have gotten to know the day and night staff, including the manager very well now and each and every single time have gotten the best service. We have become dedicated customers, the food is always perfectly what we want, how we want it, and the servers are always very attentive and make us feel super comfy! Lenny is one of our favorite servers! But we appreciate the entire staff and will continue to go to this location of Denny's as long as we live here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I don't know what I was thinking going to this place but hunger is motivation. I want to premise this by saying the staff was fantastic. The food is nothing short of typical greasy chain restaurant food. On the other hand, I wanted to reinforce my belief that chain restaurants aren't my type of restaurant."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst experience I've had at Denny's.... Before walking in I notice 3 employees outside smoking and gossiping ..... Then as we were seated our sever didn't have much enthusiasm.... Now I do understand that we arrived at 115 AM But the graveyard shift people are no different than the day people, you're supposed to provide good and happy service!  After receiving our food .... My boyfriends food was fine (only missing his ranch)... My order didn't even completely come out only my eggs, bacon (if that's even what it was ... It was the lengths of my middle finger and the width of my thumb nail) & hash browns (which I didn't order nor was it in the menu description) .....  But no blueberry pancakes showed and neither did my sister stack of 2 plain pancakes ..... We eat together not separate ... No lie we waited 10 minutes before our pancakes came out ..... So they come out and my sisters and my pancakes both had blueberries, and she's allergic , clearly why she ordered PLAIN pancakes and nothing else! Oh and let's not forget how when we cut through the pancakes they made crunching noises because they were so freaking burnt on the bottom !!!! So they make her new pancakes and they weren't even cooked fully..... Oh by this time my boyfriend finally has his ranch.... Oh and don't get my started on my bacon issue ....  And the server didn't even get the hint when I asked for another side of bacon ... Like how pathetic ... I paid for bacon not a stick ....  And while all this is going on and 4 other tables are here ... The manager and 4 other servers are sitting down and talking .... No one offered to remove or discount anything nor did they apologize .... Very rude and horrible customer service ... We will not be back !"}
{"text":"My scrambled eggs had a big black hair in it. I was going to tell the server but he just dropped off my bill and ran; didn't ask if everything was OK or anything. When I got to the register, the cashier asked me how my food was and I told her that there was a hair in my food and she said \"oh I'm sorry about that\" and that was it. And to make things worse, the manager was standing right there. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago with my mom for brunch.  Parking was easy to find. The staff members were genuinely friendly, we were seated immediately, and able to order when we finally made our decisions on what to get.  The food came fairly quickly, and it was exceptionally tasty.  No complaints whatsoever! We had a great time with great food. I will definitely be returning here for breakfast. I loved my experience here."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for breakfast any time of the day! Awesome staff! Great service! Really good food! I recommend it to everyone! I will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife is the sweetest person in the world, and she's also a difficult one to miss (being almost six feet tall, 8 months pregnant, and Mexican).  So when she comes home sobbing after being ignored for about 20 minutes while her pick-up order sits behind the counter getting cold, I can't help but feel obliged to write a review here on Yelp.    By her account (and she's currently sitting by me verifying this review, so I believe this satisfies review guidelines), she politely requested assistance four or five times and was told to wait while other parties were being pulled ahead of her to be seated or served their pick-up order.  That might be understandable if they had already taken her name and thought that her food was still being prepared, but they never took her name, and her food was clearly ready behind the counter.  Why would they deny her service?  She finally said \"thank you,\" left, and never received her order.  So I called Denny's to hear their account, and I had a conversation with someone who was polite but dismissive.  I was hoping to hear from someone who had a different interpretation of the situation and a rational explanation, but that didn't happen.  Thus, I present to you my 1 Star review of this Denny's."}
{"text":"Breakfast in Denny's near Las Vegas on the Fourth of July.  And it was a fine experience.  Our party of six was seated immediately after being greeted by a grizzled hostess, who has probably seen it all.  However, our waitress was \"Asia\", who provided top shelf service including oh so many coffee refills for everybody.  I happened to notice that from the last order given to the food brought tableside, only 12 minutes elapsed.  Yes, one order was wrong, bacon instead of sausages, but that was quickly remedied.  The delighted diner got a side of sausage.  The rest of the food was fine, hot and typical of Denny's, large portions of decent breakfast food, resulting in six happy, caffeinated people.  It's a small Denny's nestled in a hotel/casino complex, but sometimes size doesn't really matter."}
{"text":"Food was good but was brought in differnt time and forgot food one persons meal came out 20 minutes later then everyone else's"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE DENNYS where I reside. Let me say that while we walked out, 3 other couples followed. All of the waitresses had poor presentation and made me feel like my food wasn't clean. In addition to this our waiter had crumbs in between his teeth and it was falling out through the edges of his mouth when he was taking our order. Took 20 minutes before we walked out and we did not have our coffee yet.  Very disappointed.  :("}
{"text":"The food is ok. Definitely not worth the wait though. We sat here for nearly an hour while the restaurant emptied out, being told that the manager said no one could be seated yet."}
{"text":"I probably should of read the rest of yelp reviews before I had dinner. I was hungry sou thought this was my usually trip to Dennys with out any problems. So the lady when you walkways friendly. And then after that it got bad. we waited and waited.Then  a person came and took our beverage ordered and then he came back and dropped the drinks mothering's coffee and myself were cloakroom temperature. Then we got our food in we rid shifts. My food came after my whole family was eating and then my mother in law food skillet was cold, tortillas same. Then my sister got her food last and her toast was Luke warm. My manager came and said sorry and took 15% of the check, I"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food for a good price. The waitress was so nice. I enjoyed a nice breakfast with my grandson."}
{"text":"So tonight we chose Denny's as our choice of dinner.  The reason I am giving this location 5 stars is because of Max. Max was AMAZING! When I say he was awesome, he went beyond and above for every single table in our section. He was a host, busser, server and cashing people out! When Max would bring a table a drink or hot sauce, he would bring stuff for every table that needed something all in one trip. One table would need refills, another table wanted coffee, I asked for ranch, and he would come back with his tray and stop by every table with what the needed.. in like 20 seconds! He was very friendly and even paid for my kids scoop of ice cream! I told him this all in person, and he told me I made his day! I wish more people were more like Max.. fast, didn't even need to write anything down when asking what people wanted.. he always remembered, very friendly, and just all around a wonderful guy. Another table by us, even was saying the same thing about Max! He deserves a raise! Will definitely come back to see him again!"}
{"text":"Clearly the nicest Denny's I've ever been too. It's extremely spacious, with even a diner decor and online ordering ready to go. But smelling a loaded diaper with no baby or elder in sight when I opened the door, that's probably the best summation of the experience.  I remember Denny's being the cheap place compared to IHOP, the other 24/7 joint. It's clear with the $2/$4/$6/$8 menu. But if don't order from it, everything is priced the same. My Ultimate Omelette with tax and tip came closer to $14 - when I could order that omelette at any breakfast giant in the area. And it was decent - everything advertised in the ingredients was on my plate. But just like a good Photoshop job before you swipe right, there's that ounce of regret once you bite into the real thing."}
{"text":"I know - Denny's?  Why would anyone go there?  Well they have awesome breakfasts - free egg whites - and if you tell them what you want, they'll make it even if it's not on the menu!  I get an egg white omelette with mushrooms, onions, jalapenos and salsa.  And they are fast ... they keep your drinks refilled ... the staff are always friendly ... and they will give you drinks to go which says alot when you live somewhere that's 110 in the summer!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the server (Barbie) was very great and friendly. Had a great meal."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Denny's Ive ever been to. We had to wait an hour for seating and then on top of that another hour for our food. We ordered pancakes and they charged us an extra $3 for tiny little sorry pieces of strawberries even a baby would be mad to see! And on top of that when the food arrived, it was cold, like it took a trip to Antartica and back. I ordered the country fried steak and eggs and the sauce was so heavy, clumpy and thick! Made my stomach scream! Although, the waiter was kind but looked very lost. There was a family sitting across from us who were also upset about the same problems I was having. Won't ever step foot into this location again, ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I toggled between a 4 and a 5-star review, which isn't something I hand out to chain restaurants lightly, but wow, having never been to a Denny's for anything other than breakfast before I was unsure what to expect when I went in deciding that I was feeling a burger.   The restaurant is easy enough to access if travelling westbound along Rutherford, or south/north bound along Melville/Creditstone. It's a large and bright, with an almost cartoonish look to the outside - as you drive up you literally feel like you're seeing a Denny's in a commercial.   Anway, lunch rush was busy (again, surprised) and we had a short 10-minute wait but staff were super pleasant in handling the crowds and took our names and seated us in 2 minutes.  AS mentioned, I'd heard good things about the burgers so I went with the classic double cheese burger - Cheddar cheese tops two hand-pressed 100% beef patties. Served with lettuce, tomato, red onions and pickles. Served with choice of side. Standard.  What hit the table 10minutes later was anything BUT standard. A massive burger! Piled high with toppings and sides. And best of all, unlike every other burger I've had at any chain restaurant the meat was hand pressed onto a flat top so it was thick cut, crumbly and a little charred. I could barely get my mouth around it and the meat was super moist still.  Easily a chain who is executing beyond the normal in terms of food quality and quality service. I can't wait to try the other burgers.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Great place for a 24/7 diner. Service is always good and food quality is pretty decent for the price you pay. I've paid more at actual restaurants for food that was not worth even if it were free. Denny's is a family style diner and has ample space. Located right next to the theatre and lots of parking space."}
{"text":"Racist and nasty food!!!  My sons and I went into this location this morning for breakfast,  the general manager seated us.  We were seated in the back seating area, when there were more than ample seating in the main dining area.  Yes, were are African American, I found this very offensive.  I did not say anything to him, because my oldest son said not to, that he is used to it.  It is so sad that in 2016 we still have to live with this kind of racism, worst yet my son has become immune to this kind of treatment.  As for the meal, it was really not great, we had powered/boxed eggs and boxed pancake and salty bacon, I will never, ever go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"As far as Denny's go.. I think this one is pretty much perfect. We tried to go the Denny's on the strip, but it was always way too packed. Plus, I didn't get a good feeling about that one. Then we googled the nearest Denny's and found one on Tropicana, and we were staying at the Excalibur, which was pretty close so we headed out. Come to find out, it's inside a casino, and it smelled like smoke, and there was a huge line.   So we head out again and about a couple miles away we find this little hidden gem. We walked in, no wait, got seated by a friendly waitress, and placed our orders almost instantly. A short while later, our food arrived. It was exactly what we needed after a couple days of hardcore drinking and almost no sleep. Hot, fresh, tasty, greasy food. And, most importantly, cheap. We went twice during our 5 day stay, and I will make make sure to stop by here on all my future visits."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Denny's. Food is always up to par, service is quick and with a smile, and deals they have are hard to beat. Love the fact that they're usually open 24 hours, so if you happen to be out late, you can enjoy a meal there. By checking in on yelp I also received 15% off my ticket."}
{"text":"I have not been in a Denny's for about a year so we decided to drop by the Watson Rd location for breakfast as we were on a tight schedule. First thing I noticed was the dirty windows and floor. So is the kitchen as dirty?  There was a line to be seated however I could see may 10 tables open. Why?   We ordered breakfast and it had to be the worst food I ever had. The hash browns had a plastic taste to them obviously frozen as they were cold. English muffin was soggy and  par toasted. The syrup tasted like plain sugar and the sausage was mushy. The bacon was scrawny and had a enhanced smokey flavor that was awful. In short there was plenty of food left on the plates.  Denny's has a new low standard of serving inedible processed food that is not cooked to order. Shame on Denny's for serving such crap."}
{"text":"We wait FOREVER for our food every time we come here, no matter what time of day, even if it's a take/out order. However, I love Denny's and their food but aim for a different location!"}
{"text":"I LOVE DENNYS . Most often we have a good experience with Michelle (I think that's her name )    However one time ...  In September we had a waiter ring us out and he started cussing at the computer like crazy! Then he yelled some more obscenities  when trying to find a manager. He rolled his eyes at us the whole entire time while serving us. Needless to say I reported him.  They need to hire more people who take pride in their job! This place has great potential !"}
{"text":"I hate that I only have to give it a 2 stars. I have been coming to this Denny's for years. But on March 9 me and a coworker decided to go and have a bite to eat after getting off at work around 4 in the morning. I had orders Buffalo chicken strips , French fries, and pancakes. Once they arrived, I had to return the chicken strips were over cooked , and when I went to butter the pancakes, The bottom pancake was all torn to pieces. The waitress took the food back and then returned  and asked if we can pay our bill so she can end her shift, so we did it. So here comes the food by the new waitress, the chicken was OK, but the pancakes were about an inch thick and doughy, so we asked if we can have them remove it and we were told that we couldn't because we already paid our bill, so I order the waffle she told me that that wouldn't qualify because it was $6 dollars. So, we then  asked for a manager, which  came over and was willing to give the waffle, but, the only problem was it was the same cook! She said she would watch him. We decided we didn't want anything else this guy cooked! So we asked for a credit. We were also cut off from all survive at that time. It could have just been that night crew, because I have never had that experience before while going there."}
{"text":"Great service. Best Denny's I've been to. Went there with my family 12 in all and the service and food was on time and good. The manager Alec Baldman was best. Made our morning awesome!!!  Thank you"}
{"text":"What can you write about a Denny's? Same food no matter what location you go to. I was down in Mesa today so I stopped in to grab a bite to eat and a cup of coffee to pass a little time. I tried the new \"Red, White and Blue Slam\". I have to say I was pleasantly impressed! The pancakes where light and fluffy but they had real whole blueberries in them. I love blueberry pancakes and there were great. Topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Delicious. Nikki was my server and a good one at that. I asked to sit away from others so I could have some quiet to do a little writing while I ate. My coffee stayed full and she made sure I was left alone but not ignored. A great balance of the two. Thank's Nikki. I will definitely eat at this location again."}
{"text":"Yes....5 stars. I tire quickly of the bullshit encountered on the Vegas Strip, and specifically the crowded overpriced food offerings in the casinos. Wife wanted some pancakes around ten o'clock on a Friday night after we saw a show at The Venetian, so we headed into Denny's which s practically next door. Dinner was a stack of pancakes, hashbrowns, biscuits and gravy, and an artery clogging grilled cheese (with mozzerella sticks in it) sandwich with with fries, and a coke and a water. Price: Less than $11.00. We had just paid more than that for two cocktails even though we had a two for one ticket for said cocktails! Food was all good, restaurant was clean enough, and the entertainment (read: the colorful array of customers) was priceless."}
{"text":"We came at 10:30 AM and it was surprisingly busy. The ladies at the counter were hammering away, taking money from people as efficiently as my landlord takes money from me every month. The food was delicious... and quite nutritious! For the price and the amount, my happiness did surmount. I wish I could say I'll be back more often, but this location is just a tad out of the way. Denny - I hope we meet again."}
{"text":"Only reason I will give 1 star is our server (I think it was Jesicah) was really nice. I never go to Dennys anymore but one of my kids asked if we could go there one time and I relented. What a disaster. My two boys and I sat down, ordered our food, and then.......we waited, and waited, and waited. We were there 30 minutes and never got our food and I finally walked out. I decided to pay for our drinks because it wasn't the server's fault. However, the managment and the kitchen staff obviously have no idea how to plan and execute their roles and responsibilities. This is Denny's. The food is relatively simple. If you have a small party like us, with an easy order (one omelette, two orders of pancakes), you should be in and out in 20 minutes.  I'm sticking to places like the Good Egg excusively."}
{"text":"Well I most certainly was not expecting to fire up a 5 star Denny's review on a Sunday night, but that's the beauty of an open mind, right?  We headed out to QT to grab some wine and gas and were contemplating a dinner to go from here. We haven't showered today and layed low by the pool in attempt to do \"nothing\" before the busy week ahead. Our options were limited due to our appearance, so we figured Denny's would take us!  They sure did. We rolled right up and saw a Redbox right outside the front door, which had us pretty happy. Grabbed a couple flicks and walked in.  We were promptly greeted with smiles. The place smelled great! Like those little air fresheners you plug into the wall that mimic Grandma's house. It was clean as a whistle, restrooms and all.  Our server, Dallas was amazing! My soup was out before I could even check into Yelp on my phone. The husband had a 6 dollar giant breakfast and myself a 4 buck grilled cheese. Dallas wrote nothing down (amazing considering my odd sides and requests), our food came out hot, perfect and fresh. Refills were prompt on our icy sodas.  There really was nothing else we could have asked for.  Who knew?!  *Saw they are doing a charity benefit for the troops June 12th, 2011. 10 percent of your bill is donated. They have up some nice American decorations and some stories about local service members.  *A new menu is also expected to launch on the 7th, so keep an eye out."}
{"text":"The ambiance is quite nice, and different from the typical Denny's. The place is huge so service is understandably tough. Despite lacking speed, they are highly professional."}
{"text":"I love Denny's and have been so disappointed by our visits all over Vegas.  Plus a visit to the worst Denny's in the country on Ann and Simmons turned us off Denny's for a while.  One Saturday my Mom and kids finally convinced me give a different location a try.  This location is a gem.  The hostess was sweet and attentive (she mentioned it was her first day - pretty awesome for her first day).  Our server (Francisco?) was FANTASTIC!  He was super busy but on top of everything.  Running around like crazy taking care of every detail.  I've never seen someone look so at ease with such hard work.  He really took the time to get orders right, refill drinks and even visit with my baby.  Food was fast and the best I've ever had at a Denny's.  Place was packed but so efficient that I rarely saw any parties waiting.  I noticed a manager on the floor helping run food, drinks and training the hostess.  All other Denny's could take a lesson in pride and customer service from this location.  Good job guys!  We will absolutely be back to see you!"}
{"text":"I know it was mothers day being new to Maple we decided to try it out instead of going to the usual sunset grill like we usually do . We got there at 8:00 am and got seated and offered coffee right away. Took 40 minutes for food to arrive and it was cold. Service was nice but food portion was small and cold. For 11.49 it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"The wait in this place is ridiculous. We waited to be seated not 20 minutes like we were told but more like 35. Then, we were seated and waited another 10 minutes to be acknowledged and get our drink order. It has been about 30 minutes from when the waitress took our order and we are still waiting. The waitress is fine but everything seems to be taking a long time and no I am not talking about being here in the middle of a rush of customers. Definitely not coming back ever!"}
{"text":"Bring someone that knows cpr because you will choke on your food since they take forever to get you a refill. Plus come 20 mins early since thats how long they take to take your order."}
{"text":"Not a good experience.  I love Denny's and have been going my whole life.  I really love their menu.  The Grand Slam breakfast is a good deal which allows personalized variety.  I had two problems here: the syrup comes out globular - it doesn't pour out of the container.  Syrup is supposed to be warm and flow.  It comes out in globs.  It is very obviously filled with HFCS.  Is sugar too expensive for Denny's?  I suggest not serving pancakes if they cannot offer decent syrup.  Also, and this is the worst part - they had NO water!  They brought me a glass of water from the soda machine - when I told them it was seltzer, they knew, and said their soda machine was broken and \"a little bit of seltzer leaks in the water.\"  It wasn't a little bit - it was 100% seltzer - undrinkable.  They told me \"sorry\" and I had to eat my breakfast without any water.  This is not acceptable, and in my opinion, a health hazard.  They should have offered me bottled water, free juice, or something.  I thought about going int he bathroom to get a drink out of the sink, and then this got me mad enough to write this review. We will not be going back.  Too many other options here in Las Vegas for decent breakfasts.  I wanted to mention, too, that when we paid the bill in the front, the lady asked me how it was (she appeared to be the manager). I told her \"there was no water!\"  She said \"I know!\" And then took our money.   I couldn't believe it - very disappointing.  This was on Wednesday, December 23 at around 7:30 AM."}
{"text":"Typical Denny's food. Always pretty good. Sean was doing everything but cooking! Great job! Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Denny's there is , we come they sit us , we place a to go order and 40 min later out of 8 plates they bring out the to go burger first , they bring our plates in partials parts , we asked if they could bring it out together and the waitress gave us a an attitude , we asked for refills and she gave us attitude , they didn't bring the kids plates out right and when we placed another order She wasn't very happy , I don't understand why it's such a big problem to get food service here . All the reviews say the same"}
{"text":"The Crowfoot Denny's is consistently good and their holiday pancakes are amazing. Sweetens full of sugar but tastes amazing.   A couple of my kids love coming here because of the large portions and the big pancakes... Their eyes are always bigger then their stomachs.   Our server was super busy and had a lot of other people to serve so the slower service wasn't really her fault but the staff worked well as a team and seemed to help each other out to compensate.   I would recommend this location specifically because of the well cooked food and they are great with kids."}
{"text":"The food was what you should expect when going to Denny's but the staff just wasn't that good. I've almost never had a good waitress at Denny's before. Which granted the job does suck completely, BUT, you signed up for it so don't make everyone else's experience suck because of your incompetence. If you want Denny's then you should go. But do not expect a lovely waitress to meet your needs."}
{"text":"Oh Dennys oh baby girl, you just always amaze me. Great food, clean place and sweet service. This place not only did a facelift but is a complete in and out change for the good."}
{"text":"Clean, great service, great smiles, and the cooks know when it's time to take it off the grill... Eating breakfast starting my Saturday with a great Denny's start thank you."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's I've ever been to. Horrible service and rude management. (FYI: Does NOT participate in the Free Birthday Grand Slam promotion - even though there is a sign advertising it on their window.)"}
{"text":"My experience was ok at Denny's the food was ok but the service was terrible I waited there for 50 min it was nuts but the bright side was the food was good NEVER GO ON SATURDAY all the servers are grand slammed"}
{"text":"OK.  I read all the reviews before hitting this Denny's after dropping my wife off at Sky Harbor. It seems a lot of complainers like to post on Yelp and I thought I'd give this restaurant a chance. Glad I did.  It was 4:50 AM when I walked in the door and there were about six tables busy. The one waiter/cashier guy greeted me with a smile and got me into a booth within a minute. I ordered fast and my food was out in less than ten minutes. The omelet was huge and yummy and the hash browns were awesome. My bill was there as I finished and I was on my way.  For the people complaining about the ambiance or the service, a reminder: This is Denny's. Sometime it gets busy. Sometime the wait staff get a beak because they think they deserve to be doing something else and take their bad life choices out on their customers -before they get fired. My experience was pleasant and the food was good. Yeah, this location was probably remodeled a few years ago but, Hey! They are open 24 hours! When do you think they get a chance to buff down every seat and shampoo the carpets? Likely during the next remodel! The only visible sign of damage was a sliver of Formica that somebody broke off, likely with a vacuum cleaner. Did it ruin my meal? No.  My only compliant was the AC was set at about 55 degrees but I know it will be a great atmosphere in a month or so here in Phoenix. For that I ding them one stinking star but, I'd go back If I pass that way again. I'd just bring a sweater."}
{"text":"Came here because 5 and Diner was having \"maintenance issues\"?? Quick bite in between shopping. Seating was slow. Sat for about 10-15 minutes before asking Martina if a server was coming. After letting us and another sever know that she didn't know where our server was she did take our order quickly. Food came out fast, drinks were filled and tasted fine. Martina did a great job! She also offered us drinks to go. Bathroom was yuck , dirty and toilet paper all over!"}
{"text":"There may be many burger joints surrounding this Denny's location but none compare to Denny's burgers in my opinion. My favorite is the slamburger with egg, hashbrown and bacon on it. The wife likes the spicy sriracha burger they offer. They also have regular ol cheeseburgers that compete with the best of em. Check it out when you get the chance!"}
{"text":"This may as well be a truck stop.  Always dirty,  tables sticky and seats greasy.  Not to mention the poor quality of food and service.  Ick to Dennys."}
{"text":"Family and I were coming to this place very often, they keep the same prices but portions are way smaller, for pancakes , small, flat , andCOLD AS HELL. I'm not the kind of complaining guy, just not coming to this place anymore!"}
{"text":"My favorite Denny's by far!! Service is always impeccable and the food is great. The prices fit anyone's budget. The place is always clean and the renovation really helped modernize the location. The servers are always okay with substitutions and everything is made to order. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"DENNY'S is great!!  We got our traditional STEAK and EGGS meal at Denny's.... why?  Cuz we're freaking in VEGAS!!!  So we get our orders...they come out close to what we want but not really as MED rare as we want... but whateves  The frustrating part was waiting for the WHOLE Denny's team to settle my bill at the front counter because NO ONE knew where my debit card was.  In the end, our waitress had handed it to the manager who stuffed it in his breast pocket and was yelling at everyone to look for the dam card.  HAHAHAH In the end, he gave us the meal for 1/2 of what we were suppose to pay for.... so he was pretty nice about it.  What more can you ask for... It's freaking DENNY'S!"}
{"text":"There is the old school Denny's that have been there forever and then there is the new Denny's. This is a new one. Very clean and modern. Always full. Always friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon. It was so busy the wait was 45 minutes to get our food. The food was good. The server was sweet but too busy. The worst part of the whole thing was that the manager was screaming and cursing at her employees from the kitchen. I would highly recommend going to a different dennys unless management changes because the manager yelling and the food taking that long is all a result of poor management."}
{"text":"So... I decided to.give a lot of these places alot of chances before writing somthing but here Dennys....the people need to know!!!! No only was I dissatisfied with the random seating they gave a party of 12 for a birthday.. food was cold sad being it was mine I ordered  (the super bird) more like... (the blooper pigeon). Orders were all wrong... she wrote them all down... yes I got a free SB But the fact she kept on forgetting our refills caused my mouth to bun up.. over all it's deeny's....."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner here after exploring the Fremont Street Experience.  First Denny's I've seen with a bar inside and outdoor seating.  We sat outside and had the Salmon and Tilapia dinners - surprisingly good, with a couple of Coronas.  Flavorful and crisp veggies with both dishes.  We watched the zip line flyers go by and saw people having fun on Fremont street from our table.   Nice location.   Service was good.  Fair prices.  I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"This was one of my worst experience, as we walked inside Denny's there were two men walking out complaining about the long wait. We should have left right there and then, but we were hungry after all it was after 9pm, we sat and ordered then waited, waited and waited. I finally stood up and the cook saw me and looked at the waitress (wish I hadn't seen since she brought our water) I asked for our food, (we only ordered apple Cranberry dinner Salad) when this waitress finally brought our salads, it was so small, the plate was barely covered with lettuce and there were no apples.   We walked out. This is not a place to go eat."}
{"text":"Worst place time and time again. Food came out slow which I could understand because it was busy, but server disappeared for over 20 minutes. Drinks were empty on the table the entire time. Food finally came out and everything was cold. Had them remake it and it came out within 10 seconds reheated in a microwave and still cold. Terrible service and horrible food handling. NEVER EAT HERE! Go to the Denny's off of 75th instead! Save yourself the frustration!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Dennys for over a year now . The only best service I received was from the greeting from the hostess Taren . Every time I come she greets me with a smile and very attentive to the customers needs and goes out her way to help other customers in the restaurant. The waitress I had had a attitude , I only seen her one time that's when I ordered my food then I never seen her again . The only assistant I received was from the hostess. Denny need to hire more servers like Taren I believe there business would be better and get more business"}
{"text":"I came here during the morning rush and had prompt service, the food was good. However they were slow on drink refills."}
{"text":"If i could give this place 0 stars I would .. i order my food online and I still waited 15 for my food . I only get a30 min lunch so I had to hurry and eat It. When I asked what was taking so long she said it'll be another 10 min .. she then goes to the cook and pulls my order down. It had been sitting up there the entire time !!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came craving the popular American all day breakfast food chain.  To our disappointment, upon arrival we waited approximately 5-8 minutes before getting seated despite being first in line and numerous empty tables around. Once seated, we were left alone for another 10 minutes meanwhile the people who were seated after us got water, and their orders taken. Finally,  we got a hold of someone but they said our waitress was too busy to serve us when there were only 2 other tables she was serving. After another couple minutes we got our orders taken. We ordered the Lumberjack slam ($12.99) and Country fried steak ($13.99).  Food: From our meal we enjoyed the pancakes, the country fried steak, zucchini, the hash brown (although slightly saltier than my personal preference) and the sausages from my breakfast. Everything else was quite average and on the saltier side.  Verdict: The meal was enjoyable but definitely did not exceed expectations in terms of service or food quality. I would consider coming again as the service and food could be a one-off situation.  However, I would not go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"The absolute worst place to go! If your hungry go some place else! Sat at a table for over 30 minutes. Not one person came to ask us what we wanted to drink much less take our order. The couple across from us was waiting even longer then us had gotten up and left. We followed not long after they left. They watched us leave did not even acknowledge us. The manager didn't even pay attention to any of the customers just stood around talking. Save yourself the trouble and find someplace else to eat. Denny's used to be a favorite place for us to go too. Never again."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Denny's when traveling across country. I don't have much of a budget when traveling and when making a speed run, I just want to know I'm going to get decent food. Denny's usually hits it on the head.  While the food was great, the service was, not so much.  Now, mind you I did roll in at about 1:00 AM / 12:00 AM (MT/PT), but I've done that all over the west and never had service like this.  The only waitress was at the counter eating and reading the newspaper. She was obviously the only one there and was on lunch, so she took my order none the less (comes out to a draw, really, due to poor management). The waitress though looked like she was on tough times herself (and probably looking for a new job in the classifieds).  The food was standard fare for Denny's.  However, what I noticed about this Denny's from the ones I had been to recently in Arizona is this: No free WIFI Internet (which sucked because the only reason I went to Denny's was hoping for WIFI to check the weather and road conditions ahead since this was winter). They also did not have The Bite Network, which was always a great way to pass the awkward time between ordering and eating when dining alone.  If I'm passing through Vegas again I will probably not stop at this Denny's."}
{"text":"The service is not necessarily terrible, more that the restaurant is incredibly unorganized and it reflects in the servers morale. I went with friends for brunch and our server was good (but perhaps a bit down-trodden). BUT who I assume was the manager,  Joe brought us out our food and part of my meal was missing. I asked where it was and he didn't seem to know what I was talking about. Chips and Queso is supposed to be queso, not ranch sauce like he seemed to think. He had to go and ask our server what was missing and the server eventually brought it out.  Food was decent but entirely underwhelming and beige."}
{"text":"It's pretty alright, just your average Denny's, they seemingly have their shit together now judging from the previous reviews."}
{"text":"I went out for Breakfast with my son and his friend and everything was until our food came the bacon was disgusting I didn't even eat it and I had 4 strips on my hash Browns were well done to the point that they were so hard then they gave me another side of hash Browns in those weren't could thoroughly my son had chicken and biscuits and the gravy  underseasoned tasted like flour..his friend only ate his pancakes.. which he had a lumberjack ... The cashier  Decided to  was take off one of the meals clearly we did not eat our food but they only give us a discount for $10 off of a $50 ticket  the service was mediocre ..  My suggestion is stay away from that Denny's"}
{"text":"I went early in the morning around 7 am.  The waitress was wonderful, but the food wasn't and neither was the floor underneath my booth.  I only had two scrambled eggs and coffee.  Several hours later I was still experiencing a stomach ache.  I never eat at Denny's for this reason alone.  Enough time goes by and my brain decides to give it another try.  Let down again.  I will not ever set foot in another Denny's again."}
{"text":"The food is good. The best Wendy's I've had in a long time. The waitress was nice and quick to take our order."}
{"text":"We live right across the street from this Denny's, so you can say we are regulars. This time around was the worse experience I have ever had. My husband ordered a large nacho for an appetizer and for his meal a build your own hamburger for myself I ordered the Spicy Chopped Steak with corn and broccoli. Nacho's was off the chain, but when we got our order other people who came in 20 to 30 minutes after us had eaten and left.  My husband got his hamburger and about 5 minutes later I got mine. My broccoli was still frozen and my chop steak (flat hamburger) was room temperature. They asked me if I would like another one, but I refused. A lady manager was not friendly, I would have like to see that Asian manager he is very friendly and he knows how to run that Denny's right."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! If there were no stars that would be my rating. From the moment we walked in we were not able to choose the next booth over but the waitress by the name plate I read \"Scheneka, D\" said we couldn't and that was ok...we ordered and yes she brought our stuff but brought the bill right over and we were nowhere near done eating. Up to there I was still fine until I asked for more coffee and the waitress rolled her eyes but she indeed brought the coffee poured it  and spilled it right through the table like if she would be able to toss it to us she would! Then we asked for more pancakes since we got the all you can eat and she rolled her eyes again, I mean that is her job and I think customer service should be your #1 priority but she didn't stop there she basically tossed my partners drink when he asked for a cup of water. We felt very upset especially since we are frequent Denny's customers and this has been by far the worst location!"}
{"text":"This location never disappoints!! Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. And it is awesome! ! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Denny's I have ever been to. We usually love Denny's but this location was horrible! The food was disgusting, it was a long wait, our waiter always got lost. On top of all that the hostess was so disorganized she didn't know what she was doing.  I mean this was crazy. Don't bother coming to this location you'll be seriously disappointed. Just saying..=/"}
{"text":"I've never had an issue with this Denny's up until today my boyfriend went in to grab some smoothies to go and on the drive back I was sipping on the smoothie and I started pulling pieces of plastic from my mouth so I went back to Denny's and my boyfriend complained to an employee and they claimed that there was nothing in the drinks and they replaced them and again there were so many pieces of plastic in our smoothies."}
{"text":"There come times in your life when you feel intentionally tested. This is one of those times. Three times they brought me under cooked sausage, three times. Then I guess one of the girls thought she could pull a fast one on me. This girl tried to tell me that the sausage links came pre cooked and that's just what they look like. I know what under cooked pork looks like, that is the lamest excuse I've ever heard."}
{"text":"Anything you would expect a typical Denny's. Average food for an average price.  I came here with my boyfriend one night. The only thing I will comment on that makes my trip to Denny's different from other trips is that they had Baconalia and my boyfriend decided to try the maple bacon sundae, against the waiter's advice and mine! Bacon is great but there are just some areas that bacon should not go and one is a sundae at Denny's. The maple syrup is their regular syrup that sinks to the bottom of the glass. There were bacon crumbles on top that was equivalent to 1 slice, which got soggy being on the ice cream. I would not advise that sundae to my enemy.  All in all nothing out of the ordinary except for the catastrophe of the maple bacon sundae."}
{"text":"Miserable experience unlike previous visits here. We travelled from Matthews to have dinner. We agree with some of the other reviews about This place being clean and updated but all for naught because the service was horrific. We were brought to our table, server took our beverage orders (coffee, tea, ice tea, waters). There were no silverware on the tableo and even after the server brought out our beverage, he forgot the water, we had to ask him for spoons. we ordered appetizers (mozzarella sticks and cheese quesadillas). That  came out without any dipping sauce or even plates and when we asked him the server said he could bring us some as he didn't know the  food came with it...I just do not understand, This place has real potential  but with the current staff it will go the way of most of the 80's Denny's...CLOSED"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for a quick bite, boy did that turn out wrong. Server took forever, the manager helped us to drinks and by the time the server even came by, 20-25 minutes had passed. No introduction or anything, all we got was a \"what do you want?\" Appetizer took another 20 min for 2 chicken strips and 4 cold mozzarella sticks that were falling apart. Server came by after we were done asking us what we ordered... Entrees took another 20, our to-go order never came. Our server's excuse was that he wanted to give us more time to eat the app before the entrees (really? For 2 chicken tenders?) But it was clear he forgot. Overall he was rude and the only positive thing was the manager who seemed to really care and was really nice. Food was not very good. Probably won't come back if we get the same server again."}
{"text":"SERVER WAS GREAT. She was nice and attentive, great customer service (11:00pm 8/27) my slow cooked pot roast was yummy, very salty though! The only reason for 4 star instead of 5 is because i ordered the chocolate molten expecting it to have chocolate inside but there is none :("}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch. We wanted a place where we could sit and talk for a long period of time and not feel guilty about depriving someone else of a table. Not looking for gourmet food. We were looking for a clean restaurant with good food at reasonable prices. We got everything we wanted at Denny's. I had the senior menu fit omelet. Under $10, under 500 calories, very filling, and delicious. Our server was very attentive and very friendly. A perfect fit for what we wanted for a lunch."}
{"text":"Visited twice while in Vegas. Completely different experiences.  Breakfast 8 am - 5 stars. 2 of us. Was seated right away and brought our coffee right away. Waitress was very nice and helpful and attentive. Food was good. Pancakes n eggs.  Lunch 3:30 pm - 2.5 stars.  Alone. Was seated right away but waited forever for water, maybe 20-30 min. Then waited 30-45 min for my meal. My water was empty when she brought me meal, she said she'd bring me more water but never did. I asked for the bill when I was done and a to go cup with water. The waitress was very apologetic for the delays. There were only 2 waitresses for the whole place and they were cashiers too. I felt sorry for them. But I didn't get out of there til 5, which was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Horrible take out experience. We live about 15 minutes to a half hour from this place depending on traffic. Tonight was a half hour traveling night. I put in the order over the phone with a rep name Candy, she repeated everything back to me correctly. My husband went to pick up the order. He didn't look at it till he was back home, one of the meals was completely missing and the other was missing sausage that came with the meal. After calling to see if they can refund the difference back to our card and give us a discount for the inconvenience. They tell us we have to call back in the morning to speak with the regular manager. I'm going to learn sooner then later to save my money, don't be lazy and cook my own food no matter what. I usually have more bad than good experiences when eating out."}
{"text":"I went in on Wednesday@midnight april 13 there was 1 server working a colored fellow that didn't even seat so we had to seat ourselves. That's not even the half of it, we say there for another 15 minutes still no drink we had to get out own menus and silverware . My wife and I were astonished because there were only 2 other customers in the building..such poor service, the guy obviously had no idea what he was doing. I am a cook and could give better service than this crazy guy. Maybe he should think of another line of work or lay off the dope. Dennys should really screen their help before hiring this kind of weirdo... will never be back for late night there ever again, I urge everyone to just go to ihop right down the street where I am sitting now..  I'm a lighter note Chrizzel is a good server in the morning shift I might be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went to Denny's and got a bowl of soup.  While eating it, I came across a piece of hair.  Although it wasn't intentional... It was gross!!! After telling the manager, she \"graciously\" gave me $2.00 off for the inconvenience.  Anytime I see hair in food, I can't but think of the movie WAITING with Ryan Reynolds.  Where did that hair come from?  When eating at Denny's, eat with caution!"}
{"text":"The cashier snatched my money from me as if I wasn't going to pay . Worst Denny's ever ...."}
{"text":"Great dinner this evening. Everything was excellent even the service!  First visit to this Denny's. We will return!"}
{"text":"Servers are slow. Don't acknowledge us or make eye contact, etc. horrible customer service"}
{"text":"My wife and I normally enjoy our visits to this location, but today wasn't the best experience. Every couple of minutes I could hear what sounded like a tub of dishes being dropped on the floor. My food was good, but what upset us was finding a straw wrapper in the dollop of butter on top of my wife's Belgian waffle. We showed our server, who was very kind and she took it away and quickly brought us a brand new waffle, wrapper free this time. When it came time to pay, the server helping us at the register asked us about the quality of the food today and we told her about the wrapper incident. She quickly got a manager to come to us, but the manager only asked if we \"got a new one\", and nothing was done on our bill in reflection of that mistake. That all seemed like a waste of time, since we had to wait for her to come talk to us and then pay our bill afterwards. We did eat the replacement waffle but that isn't the point, serving food like that goes against your guarantee as a restaurant to deliver clean and safe food. We didn't even get an apology from the manager! At the very least, we could have been refunded or something. Since we are food industry veterans this left a bad taste in our mouths as we left the establishment. We will continue to give this location our patronage because of convenience, cleanliness,  and quality but we really hope this kind of thing doesn't happen to us again!"}
{"text":"I came in with my husband, son and granddaughter....the side we were on was empty and my DIL, grandson and granddaughter showed up to surprise everyone, as it was Valentine's Day.  For one, our server was inattentive, and very slow to do anything. My husband and son met me on their lunch break. My two granddaughters (babies) and DIL, didn't even get any food. I only ordered hashbrowns, bacon and fruit....the bacon and hashbrowns were so disgustingly greasy and the fruit looked like it had been frozen and was super mushy, I could only eat the fresh cut bananas on the top. I left most of it. My husbands food was wrong, she brought out a chicken breast and fries for my grandson, instead of the chicken nuggets that were ordered. She said, oh just see if he'll eat it...she never came back to check and we couldn't find her. He didn't eat it, we left the entire plate of food, and we were still charged for it and could do nothing about it, because my son and husband were late back to work, It took so long, we asked for our food after more than 30 minutes had passed and were told it would be right up...UGH! The server even saw the uneaten food and was so disinterested. My husband called the number on the receipt when he got back to work and still has not gotten a reply from his message, hence the Yelp. I am SO disappointed, we have had slow service before or bad food, but never all at once. The only good thing about this visit was the host, he is a younger guy and so full of personality."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, lots of parking, the staff are helpful and friendly, and the food is just great. Big portions and the prices are reasonable. Very clean as well. This restaurant used to be located on Queen street, now it's at Queen and Airport Rd."}
{"text":"Top shelf indeed. Their signature roast coffee is indeed a world class blend that all should experience. If money is no object, I suggest the French toast slam. Never before has such a delicious meal been presented to me in such style."}
{"text":"The food is as at usual standard of a regular Dennys. What stands out is the service by the lady here, during late nite. She is very sweet and nice. Two visits in a weeks says it all."}
{"text":"I mean it's Denny's, the \"McDonalds of breakfast.\" Can't really be mad that the food quality was poor and the service was mediocre. Our waitress simply provided piss poor service because we asked her to do her job. Won't be back to this place."}
{"text":"Warning Rant Coming Up!  This place is awesome for drunken club goers, as I have been in my younger years, but this place flat out sucks, horrible to be precised.  So I show up at 1:30 am, I was already in a grumpy mood and hungry, I walked in, There were people in line at the host desk /reception, NO Sign saying wait to be seat or otherwise.  I stand in line; a guy from the back says can I help you or nods? So I thought maybe they had lost their marbles, and were making people order at the desk as the folks beside me was doing (take out only) realized that later   I politely said I would like Bacon and eggs, the guy very rudely says \"would you like be seated? Or what? So that woke me the F up , I was like seated please, the other girl at desk taking orders noticed it, and had a awkward smile on her face, thinking did her co worker just actually say that to a customer ?  So now the guy walks me in and shows me a table, I was like let me tell you something the way you talked me out there was really rude, the guys like  \"sorry\" and walks away   Now my server comes very happy go lucky guy at 1:40 am now, I said I would like bacon and eggs no toast please, the server goes and? I am like nothing else just bacon and eggs, over easy, etc, the server goes you can choose 3 or 4 more items, and shows me an item called the grand slam, I am like great, but I don't want or need 4 more kind meat,  I said just bacon is good, the guy kept on insisting \"for the money you should order more items blah blah..  I was like great add whatever..He goes can I double up on the hash? I said Sure!  Now my meal is served. Two eggs done right, two skinny soggy microwaved bacon, one of them kind of cooked, the other one just soggy and translucent. The whole plate of covered with the shredded hash brown.   I was so grossed out I did not bother to ask for a re order of bacon. I just ate the eggs, tired the hash (drenched in oil, and also smelled like the oil had not been changed in  2 weeks) and never mind the bacon.  I just left the cash on the table, and told a random server that I left the money for the server who was serving me .. ..  Overall? You got it! I give it a zero stars on totality   The only pro about this restaurant is that it is open 24 hours, and it serves breakfast all day long...."}
{"text":"Wow - so impressed!  Haven't been in a Denny's in probably 10+ years.  Was hungry for pancakes-so stopped in with a friend that loves breakfast food.  Tristy was there to greet us right away and seat us - she was such a delight to have as a server - so good at what she does and has the most beautiful spirit about her.  She was the reason we had a great meal.  So friendly and personable.  The food was done perfectly and a real bargain too!  Wish every server that I encounter is as great and awesome as Tristy - would be a much better and happier world!!  Thank you, Tristy!"}
{"text":"Got seated quickly which was a plus and the waitress was nice but the food took a while, was Luke warm and  toast was hard as heck. Pancakes looked like pancakes but tasted like nothing no flavor."}
{"text":"Food was good but the raspberry iced tea that tasted of bleach was horrible!!! Yes i sent it back 3 times ! Yes 3 times and each time tasted of bleach and no manager ever came out to talk with us.  The bleach taste in my mouth ruined the taste of my favorite sandwich The Super Bird.  So disappointed that i will not be back to this Denny's and i just moved in down the street from here."}
{"text":"After stopping at another Dennys and being told they didn't have coffee we came here, got coffee and breakfast. Good service and they were super busy! Shout out to our server who seemed to do every job in the place! Latina Wonder Woman! Thank you for being there like Dennys always is."}
{"text":"Literally the worse ever. We stopped by on our way home after being on the road all night. Very tired but still 30 mins from home we needed coffee and a bathroom. It took the hostess/waitress forever to seat us then asked what we wanted to drink before we sat down we both said coffee to which she replied we only have decaf.... Ok.... No thanks we'll just take oj, after using the disgusting bathroom and washing my hands twice I walked out to a very empty restaraunt (besides my bf) from the kitchen is vulgar rap music blaring. I sat down and thought, they can't brew us regular coffee? It's 430 in the morning!! We're out of here. Drank and paid almost $8 for 2 ojs. Never again Dennys."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Denny's in town.  The service and the food have been consistently good now for some time.  Tonight they saved what started out as a disaster at the Top Shelf, where they were seating people who had just walked in ahead of people who had been waiting 10 minutes or more for a table.  So we left there and went to our favorite Denny's.  I recently turned 55, so I had, for the first time, their Senior Fit Fare Stuffed Veggie Omelette.  So did my husband.  It was very good.  Each item -- omelette, fruit, English muffin -- came out separately, due to a little confusion on the part of a new waitress, but they were very nice and apologetic about it (instead of making excuses).  They understand customer service."}
{"text":"The tables were sticky and almost felt covered with syrup from previous customers, but other than that there was almost no problem. The hostess and waiter we're very nice, the waiter (scottezz) even changing the thermostat after being asked by my wife. The food arrived very quick but was not rushed. The only problem overall with this place is cleaning. The floors and tables were almost disgusting. There's less trash out on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Over the weekend a girlfriend and I decided to stop at Denny's for brunch. I hadn't been here since having come back into town and I had pretty good memories of the place.  It was Saturday morning and the place was packed. The atmosphere is what you'd expect of a standard breakfast joint in the city. Nothing fancy; Get in, Get Grub, Get Out.  I ordered the 'Fabulous French Toast Platter' and my friend got an omelette. The food was okay, nothing special but the portions were huge and that's always good first thing in the morning.  Overall, nothing to write home about, but a decent breakfast/brunch spot if you're looking for a place to go.  It's A-OK and I guarantee you wont leave hungry. Mission Accomplished."}
{"text":"Never great service, even when not busy. Now they no longer give Military discount....sad!"}
{"text":"Based on my last visit this store gets a 5 star rating from me... They were on their game!!! Awesome service, great attitudes and wonderful people..... I would return based on my last visit.... I have been to this location before but it has been some time.... Definitely a big change... Restaurant was clean and service was great... I have 3 boys and one of my biggest pet peeves is when the waitress/waiter brings me or other adults at the table food before the kids because by the time they get theirs they have already eaten half of mine... Not this time... Our waitress even came over when she saw the kids getting antsy with some crackers and their sides so they didn't drive me nuts..."}
{"text":"Got here before 6pm, and didn't get our food until 7:20 pm for a party of 6 and a one year old baby. Thankfully, half the older kids (11, 10)  food came out so it settled them down for the long wait, the baby's food never came because the waiter forgot to add it (he apologized, gave us her meal and didn't charge us for it). During the time waiting for our food, a couple who had been asking for a box that never came, went to empty table to empty table grabbing silverware and used the napkins as a carry out, went to the front to pay yet no one was on the front desk.  About 15 mins after, the adults food and the rest of the kids food came out. We complained about the length of time, asked for the manager, but apparently he was training a new cook. We went ahead and ate our food, hashbrowns were oily, cold, gross, my pancakes were still goo in the center, but I just ate around them instead of waiting another possible hour for new ones. Our waiter had come back, apologized some more (not his fault about the food) and told us the manager had offered us free salad and soup as an apology. We declined, but said thank you anyways. The kids were satisfied with their food, no complaints from them.  Our waiter, awesome... Food, meh... experience, fail. Not the first time I've been disappointed with this Dennys."}
{"text":"This was the strangest trip to any restaurant I've ever had. We walk in to no one at the counter, the manager comes out and ignores us, then turns to the kid sweeping up and asks him to seat us. The kid is definitely odd and a bit rude, i.e. I say \"just the two of us please\"and he responds with \"oh really? I see six of you\" no laugh, smile, or words follow, just turns around and waves for us to follow him. We sit at the table and no one comes to us for at least 15 minutes, no silverware, water, coffee. Then the party starts. Our waiter comes up and is the strangest person I've ever met, going off on crazy tangents and honestly just making our experience uncomfortable, these are things I have no problem tolerating, if the service is good. From here we order coffee and our entrees (since we've had more than enough time to decide by now and we already want to leave). He brings us coffee and I hear him turn to a waitress and tell her he brought us decaf since there wasn't any coffee ready. I ask him if it's decaf and he tells me no, like, dude I just heard you... Anyway we start eating, no coffee or water refills until we're halfway through our meal. He brings the coffee out and with no warning from him I take a sip and the coffee is 1 degree shy of its boiling point, I'm still recovering today. Not to mention he forget to put in 1/3 of our order and we didn't receive some dishes. At the end of the meal we discuss the tip, agreeing that we'd not tip our usual 20% as this was just not a good experience, the server brings our receipt and asks us to total it out with the tip before he runs the card! So now he has to see the tip and deal with us afterwards, forcing us to tip him out 20% so we can avoid that awkward situation. One of the weirdest, most uncomfortable trips to Denny's ever,  I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Barbie escaped the dollhouse to serve us our food tonight.  Ken was nowhere in sight and her squeaky, chirpy voice asked us if there was anything we wanted.  Well, silverware is awesome.  We got our drinks (albeit the water refills were a little slow on the upswing), and waited some time for the food.  The food arrived, but, uh, no silverware.  How does one eat hash browns if not with a fork?  \"Oh!\" the waitress shrieked.  The couple behind us babbled loudly in Spanish and ate their food with their silverware while our biscuits, eggs, and hash browns grew cold.  Cars passed by.  A cop car pulled into the parking lot and a ghetto bird flew overhead.  Finally we got some silverware and attempted to dig in.  My friend Patty made a face as she bit into her fries.  Soggy, soggy, soggy.  She slathered Tabasco sauce on them in an attempt to revive them from their soggy slumber.  My biscuits and gravy were pretty typical; I wouldn't have expected more from a Denny's.  The hash browns could have been more crisp, but they were okay, I guess.  The waitress slammed things on the counter as we left after I paid her 10% for her nonattentive, non-cup filling, non-silverware dispensing service.   Classy.  P.S. Patty would like to note that her boyfriend got food poisoning and spent the night puking.  Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Service is horrible! Took forever to get seated when there were only about 4 other parties already seated, and it took even longer for them to come take our order. There are people literally asleep waiting for their order."}
{"text":"My wife and I needed a fast restaurant for breakfast after s an early morning appointment. We were not looking for gourmet but we did need it to be clean and quick. We were passing a Denny's. It was exactly what we needed. What server came by almost immediately and provided the desperately needed coffee. We each got a senior fit fare omelette made with egg whites. Each of us found the omelette to be delicious. It was filled with veggies and an appropriate amount of cheese. Neither of us could finish the omelette because it was so large. Next time I would consider getting one for the two of us. And the total bill came to just over $10 a head counting the cost of the coffee and the tip. Highly recommended for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very dirty! I've seen a waitress brush her bangs over the parfait counter in the kitchen, I've seen a waitress transfer pancakes to another plate with her bare hands, also pick up a dropped pancake from the floor (but don't worry, she checked to make sure there wasn't anything on it). Another waitress coughs all the time in the back kitchen, she doesn't cover her mouth or wash her hands."}
{"text":"my waiter was great roberto and my meat ball pasta was to die for. loved it and the staff was awesome."}
{"text":"This is just sad. It is a wednsday night at 6:25 pm. I worked all day and didn't want to cook. My boys unanimously chose pancakes for dinner. Waited ten minutes in the lobby. There are three customers and a to go order. My sons have finished their juice. Our waitress is special to say the least our waitress whose name is Odette  looks like she just rolled out of bed. The service is so bad and slow I was wondering if she might be learning impaired. But no, she is just a horrible waitress. This dennys is near our home. Kudos to the morning team who never give bad service even when the Sunday line is out the door. She can't even handle the three tables they are splitting. Seriously she is in the wrong field. This is my first ever bad review and it is making me angry having to give it. That being said this is the worst dining experience we have ever had. Side note I had to get my own silverware and my six year old son brought the cups to her for a refill. All she had to say was that refills were not included. Really."}
{"text":"Place is empty at 2:30 am.  Waitress/manager was rude, just ignored us.  All we were trying to do was get s quick to go order.  Such a shame to have such bad service at night.  Service was good in the morning.  We finally just had to leave after being ignored for ten minutes."}
{"text":"I am glad I didn't base going on some of the reviews I read.  I was very pleased with my visit.  We were seated as soon as we walked in the door.  We had drinks within minutes, which were always filled without asking.  Our food was at our table quick.  Everything was delicious, at our table we had nachos, sante fe skillet and kids grand slam.  The restaurant is older and could probably stand to get a makeover but the service was great.  The food had great flavor.  We were in and out in under an hour, with three kids that's a great thing.  Our waiter Diego was great with my kids.  He talked to them like people and did not ignore them.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple times and it's always the same story, food takes a little bit close to an hour to come out every time I go; no matter how busy they are. I joke with my friends that if you want to loose 2 hours of your life to go to this location. I have no hate against dennys, the food is usually good but this location always does this. This is the LAST TIME I'll ever go to one of these diners!!!"}
{"text":"I dont know why we keep trying this place except the location is convenient.  The wait staff is always rude (we have been re-trying this place for 5 years now, and after this morning we won't be back) Food is ok, and prices are high for a Dennys and they nickel and dime for everything. We shared a couple better establishments with our fellow Tahiti Village owners within walking distance, with great service and food and prices!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning  Pros Place was packed and we still got a seat for 2 in under 10 min We informed our waitress that we were in a rush so we received our food quickly  Great service   Cons  Food was fairly overpriced for breakfast  Food was bland and tasteless"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible customer service. We placed an online order and went to pick it up at 4:30am, with our emailed receipt. The worker (Alyssa or Alessia) said she never received the order and refused to make our food or refund our money. She insisted we wait until a manager comes in at 7am. 2 1/2 hours?! We left with nothing and called to get more information, and she hung up on us multiple times. She told us to contact corporate, however they don't open until 8am. We are very upset. We actually called another store to verify their policy, and they reported they would make the food because we had a receipt."}
{"text":"Way better that I ever expected or remembered. We haven't been to this Denny's in a long time. I never really thought much about going the place because the Cracker Barrel is across the street and and Haymaker just down the road. They are our normal go to places.   We got there at three on a Wednesday afternoon and we where the only people there. All the staff was really nice. The cook even came to ask if everything was prepared the way we wanted.  I had gotten so use to marginal food and service this was a refreshing change. My wife had a Gouda cheese burger and I had a waffle with eggs and bacon. It may not be fine dinning but they nailed it.   Forget Cracker Barrel and Haymaker this is where you want to be."}
{"text":"Usual high quality Denny's.  I asked the seater to locate me away from screaming children and their bad, bad parents and she pretty much did.  Had breakfast, a nice omelet.  The coffee was good.  Service was prompt.  Better than Coco's across the street.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in here, we were subjected to an EXTREMELY RUDE woman (tall, thin with blonde hair, didn't catch her name, she's evidently a server). We put our name on the list for a party of 4, and were told it would be 10-15 minutes... didn't make very much sense considering I was looking around seeing empty tables. My first thought was that they're understaffed.  We stepped just outside because the lobby area was quite crowded with many people waiting. I went back in after a few minutes to make sure I didn't miss our name being called. The hostesses seemed confused trying to figure out what was going on. They're calling several different names and no one is around (and they really wonder why people walk out? HA). Finally the nicer hostess points and says our listed name, \"that's you right?\"  And this other RUDE WOMAN (to put it so nicely) has the NERVE to say to paying customers:  \"Lets go I was ready for you five minutes ago!\" ...walks us to the table and slams down our silverware and doesn't say another word and walks away.  Like excuse me, are you effing kidding me?! If I hadn't been with friends trying to have a good time I could have had that [explicative]'s job handed to her, because it took a lot of self restraint to not say anything.  Because of the fact that we stepped right outside the door because it was crowded and you called us right away after giving us a wrong time, it's OUR fault that you don't have your s%?# together?!  This is the first impression management and Denny's as a corporation wants me as a customer to see, huh?  I never expect exceptional service at Denny's. But that was just crossing a line, I was left with such a bad taste in my mouth that I'm sitting here even contemplating calling someone about that [explicative]. You can't honestly expect to give customers attitude and keep your job... absolutely ridiculous. If you don't like working there, then get the hell out. That's just the way it goes.  That all being said, our server was great. She was kind, attentive, and you could genuinely tell she cared for her job. If I could give zero stars, I'd still give one star for our nice server. Unfortunately I couldn't really enjoy my meal and the experience was doomed from the get-go, and the food was just mediocre. I feel sorry for those who work there and actually care and have to work with such trashy people, who are abound according to many prior reviews.  One nail at a time will build the coffin ultimately dooming this Denny's location."}
{"text":"We go to this Denny's out of convenience.  We got seated right away, that's the best in this restaurant.  It took a little while to have our order taken, the food was somewhat cool and wrong. The waitress never came back to get us more coffee or to see if we needed anything else.  We saw one of the kitchen staff on his cell phone doing whatever,  several waitress waiting for food orders or something, our waitress wasn't anywhere around so we just went to the register to get our check after waiting for nearly 20 minutes. All we got was I'm sorry. There may be an IHOP down the street but it's no better."}
{"text":"Worst service in the entire world..... my boyfriend and I sat there for 25 minutes without ever even being acknowledged after we were seated not did we get drinks or even have drink order taken we moved to the bar area and the lady then came over and tried to ask cuz what we wanted to drink from where we just move from we got up and walked out and went to another Denny's on 43rd and Peoria where we were greeted friendly and our orders were taken immediately with no wait way to go Denny's on 43rd and Peoria"}
{"text":"Stopped by this location after a doctor appointment because we we're starving...  The girl at the cashier station didn't acknowledged us because she was having issues trying to figure out how to split a payment...  Once she did say \"hi\" to us and took us to a booth that still had the tip from the previous customers we waited for about 15 minutes and no one even offered us drinks so we just walked out...  Found a Farmer Boys a mile an a half away & had a great meal there for half the price of what we would've spent at Denny's..."}
{"text":"I hate to do these types of reviews. Service was not great- to be frank my waiter brought out my pancakes with a fly on top of the butter. Food was okay. Would not recommend you go there --I would rather have gone to IHOP myself.  Food took at least 35 minutes to come out after all. Waiter did not check up on us except when she brought the check."}
{"text":"Seated fairly quickly, long wait for service, stale food, orders messed up, waitress never checked to see if everything was o.k. Was not expecting great service, but 10 minutes to even see a waitress, 35 minute wait for stale food is a bit rediculous."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie; I wanted to go to this Denny's solely because of Jetta R.'s review.  Bad, bad, bad.  Bad service, bad food, bad experience.  I took my friend here twice to make sure that the first time wasn't just a fluke.  Our waitress was a total space cadet and was completely uninterested in us.  I realize Denny's isn't a high class restaurant, but I do subscribe to the belief that your water glass should never be empty.  We put our glasses at the end of the table.  The waitress flitted around at the tables behind us (there were two, maybe three other tables occupied when we visited, tops), but didn't cater to our needs.  She treated us like children on both visits.  I told my friend, \"the tip meter is running.\"  I wanted to like Jenny's, but it just sucked.  There's no reason for crappy service with a place as empty as it was."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews!  I enjoy this Denny's location!  It a a good for a quick cheap meal.  When I've been there, the staff (Today Eli waited on me--he was great!) has always been friendly and helpful.  The food is good too. . .it's Denny's. . .not Mastro's.  Today, I ordered off of the \"Build Your Own Burger\" menu and my veggi burger was yummy.  In the past, I have ordered breakfast at this location and it has been good too!  I will say that the location is dated (the only reason I gave this location a 4/5 and not a 5/5).  The decor is old, the carpets are old and stained.  The place is in desperate need of a face lift. . .especially in such a high end location.  The service and food is good though!"}
{"text":"Due to large crowds at another chain, we were forced to eat here in this restaurant graveyard part of town. The waiters are all young kids, but they seemed nice and helpful. It's best to order off the 2-4-6-8 menu as you get some great value. Most items were either $2 or $4 and they included all you can eat pancakes, a slice of French Toast and a quesadilla. All of those were fine and the chicken fingers and burger were higher priced and deemed worthy enough.  Nothing wrong with Denny's in a pinch."}
{"text":"Very nice consistent meal.  We ate breakfast as we usually do when we come to Denny's.  It's a good place to bring the family and get a good meal at a reasonable price.  I had to lower a star for the slow service due to lack of staffing."}
{"text":"3 stars because the wait for food was longer than usual. Edward was an awesome waiter and really nice tho"}
{"text":"Its Dennys     Food good. Service friendly. Perfect location across from Mirage.  Oh and that giant line at breakfast?   It MOVES pretty quickly.   Prices slightly higher than home but compared to everything else around here its cheap!"}
{"text":"I was so happy when Denny's opened near our home. Sadly we have tried it twice and the second time the service was 10 times worse than the first time. This place is disgusting. Food on the floor, dirty seats and tables. The staff doesn't care and treats everyone like with distain.  We waited 30 minutes to get water and when we asked why it takes so long we were told to come at a less busy time. The place a only half full.  We will never be back at this location again and I would suggest to everyone to never come to this Denny's."}
{"text":"Same food but the good news , only place around where you don't spend 100 plus for breakfast and you know what to expect however the service and food was better in this location"}
{"text":"So I might be biased coming back from Seattle, WA back to Phoenix, AZ, where there are few places that stay open past midnight, let alone places that will do PostMates deliveries that late in the day.  I ordered the Belgian Waffle Slam, which is a whole waffle, served with a couple sausage links, eggs cooked to your style of preference, along two strips of bacon.  The food is good to the extent of what you'd expect out of a Denny's.  Knocked a star because the wifi here is terrible; the business applies throttling on individual connections despite there only being one customer in the building at the time (me). Would not recommend setting up your laptop at this Denny's despite the restaurant being in a good part of town."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have ever had at a Dennys restaurant. I will not be returning to this location because of just how terrible this visit was from beginning to end. The woman who greeted us was rude, our server was also rude. The kitchen messed up one of the burgers that was ordered and simply pulled off the topping that was supposed to be excluded, so the taste was still there when the burger was returned. When I went to checkout, the manager who took my payment seemed as though she wanted to be anywhere but there and made me feel like I was inconveniencing her. Terrible visit from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. Absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Wait staff is nice but restaurant doesn't feel clean. Went to wash my hands before eating but the Bathroom wasn't clean at all. When I got my iced tea there was left over lipstick on the glass so I completely lost my appetite."}
{"text":"This is a new Denny's.Unlike some of the older Denny's this one was nice inside - the lighting warm, fixtures were modern, the foam seats and tile were warm earth tones.  We went right after the first Christmas mass at the local church, so seating was wide open but got busy when we were done.    The waiter came right away to wish us Merry Christ mas and to get drink orders.  The coffee was freshly brewed and though not exact;y a gourmet blend, but it was fine. The waiter was prompt coming back to get our orders.  For the regular Grand Slam ($6), I chose four items - hash browns, eggs over medium, two sausage, and pancakes.  My brother ordered the Belgian waffle slam - similar to mine but with a fluffy waffle.  My parents split a senior omelet but I gave then my two pancakes.  That's the beauty of things being served on separate plates like they did - we passed everything around the table.    The food arrived in 10 minutes.  What's nice with this Denny's that you can see some of the kitchen preparation from some tables.  Everything came back almost perfectly cooked.  The hash browns were bland, but had a decent crispiness, the sausages were just okay, but their bacon was good.  Eggs were done just right and pancakes were fluffy.  We got lots of coffee refills.   Overall, it was a pleasant decent breakfast.  I really think breakfast is their best meal, the lunches and dinners I' ve had any Denny's hve been forgettable. So as it was late morning, the place was getting crowded, and we ready to leave.  But my mom, who is the ultimate friendly chatterer, just had to tell our waiter our family history in Las Vegas.  The waiter,  seeing the 25% tip in my mom's hand, was more than willing to listen."}
{"text":"Fast, efficient, clean and friendly. Food was good. I love the fact that they use real link sausage at this location instead of the ground sausage presses into the shape of links, like some of the other Dennys locations. Only complain was I ordered eggs over medium and they still had runny whites."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Placed an online order 30 minutes before. Got there and waited another 30 minutes, just for someone to say they didn't even start on my order yet. Then I ask for a refund and the manager comes out and says wait for the GM. Waited another 15 minutes and I told them I'm leaving and they sent a pregnant women to speak with me and apologize. This place is the worst I've ever been to and worst service ever. Not only did they mess up on my order and made me and my family wait 45 minutes, they also made me late for work. I'm pissed. I'm going to be calling corporate today and never coming back. I expect my 40 bucks to be returned also or there will be some big problems."}
{"text":"The staff here is incredible, very kind and  Courteous. Tara, Chelsea and Linda are my favorite employees always helpful and fast."}
{"text":"BRIAN the manager is a liar and talks about his customers to other customers.  After completing to the owner about him we finally got what I wanted. Our wait Chis was great and stayed when he wasn't supposed to be on the floor."}
{"text":"The most filthy restaurant restrooms ever and the young female cashier/manager/supervisor had the gall to get offended when told. She sat us at the table near the restroom and the area reeked of urine! The only reason this restaurant gets one star is because of the gracious waitress we had. Otherwise, I wish this could rate into the negative like the temperature. Here's a few pics..."}
{"text":"It is a Denny's so I am not going to rate it as anything else.  It was fast and the food was hot.  No problems with service.  They do crowd you in and you are very close to people you don't know.  You do have a good view of the strip.  Price is a bit more then a regular Denny's would be.  Guess you pay for where you are at.  Not bad would probably come again."}
{"text":"It was as Saturday, we got seated right away. Drinks ordered immediately. Friendly and courteous wait staff. Food came in a reasonable time frame. Good food cooked to order. Very filling. Seat was a little oily so I wiped it off with a napkin. I will go back!"}
{"text":"There are two people working besides what I assume is a cook somewhere in the back... Waited 12 minutes to never be seen by anyone so hungry have to leave, this is the worst service at any Denny's I've ever experienced ever in my life. And it's my birthday. Couldn't suck more"}
{"text":"Love the new renovations!   This location looks great!  Everything looks new and fresh.  I especially appreciate the local murals and artwork (Pittsburgh themed).  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Service was prompt and efficient.  Food was typical Denny's food.  Some cheap deals, some specials--all cooked well :)"}
{"text":"Just left this location and the service was great Toneka was our server. She was very friendly. It was another guy server that was there as well that was very nice. All in all great place and great atmosphere with great service!"}
{"text":"Not really a Denny's fan but there are not many breakfast places in Surprise. The first time going to this Denny's was on Christmas Day 2010. The place was soooooo busy we had to wait for about 30 minutes but once we were seated the service was fast and very friendly. Our family of 7 (sometimes 12) have since made this Denny's our go-to place for breakfast on Christmas Day and throughout the year.   Went this morning - just the two of us. It was a little busy because the snow-birds are starting to fly into town. Our waitress was stuck at a table with a lady that would not stop talking and let the waitress do her job. Our schedule was tight so finally my husband gently went to the waitress and said \"we are ready to order when you are available\". She excused herself and kindly attended to our table.    For almost 4 years we have always found this particular Denny's to have good service at a fair price realizing this is not a gourmet restaurant.   Note to customers: Always be kind. Leave a decent tip.  Respect the time of others waiting for service."}
{"text":"As always food and service was good. Enjoyed my Sunday afternoon lunch with my Daughter, God Daughter,  and Grandson."}
{"text":"Screwed up our order. Waitress admitted that it was her fault but did nothing to fix the mistake. Very disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"The food's good,  when you actually get what you ordered. Been here abut 4 or 5 times and all but one time they have forgotten an item or two and given us the wrong order. This place is close to home and pretty good hence why we even bother coming back. If thus dennys is more than a 5min drive for you just go somewhere else. Find a dennys that doesn't hire incompetent people who barely return to check on their tables and forget items their customers ordered."}
{"text":"Denny's on Wyoming  is the best in Vagas. Very clean and they seat you fast. My waitress  Renee is the best. Very friendly  smile and and beautiful. Look her up. You love this Denny's"}
{"text":"Good and affordable food Denny's is known for. Clean facilities and friendly staff.  All we need.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What can I say,  well I usually give a star for the customer service and 4 for the food,  well I give a star for the customer service because there was only one young blond girl that was doing everything,  and the food was just wrong it didn't tasted good I ordered a rock sorry I meant a burger,  it was just solid I was so hungry I had to give it a try and when I went home I got so sick I almost wanted to go to the hospital, this is not a joke the city should look at this place and see what do they feed the ppl"}
{"text":"One star is too much here.  Went for breakfast at 3:00 pm. Waited forever for food. People upset and leaving.  We were Hungary so stuck it out. When food arrived, instead of hash browns with my eggs, they gave me French fries... Said they were out of hash browns and took it upon themselves to choose for me.  My husbands skillet breakfast was suppose to come with red potatoes... Surprise... He got ash browns because they were out of red potatoes.  He could not eat his... Looked old and mushy.  I cannot believe that they would not come and tell us and offer us to change dishes or select a replacement for ourselves. Upon leaving... The manager cashed us out and when we told her what happened she argued with us and said that they were not out of red potatoes.  Two waitresses off to the side informed her that they were and she copped a wicked attitude and basically told us to leave. She did not charge us for breakfast.  That was the reason for one star."}
{"text":"Great service we came in at around 915pm...we where seated right away food was filling and Monique was awesome as our server"}
{"text":"This place is very good customer service the cooks well well done cooking the food very nice place to eat and bring me to and very close to the hotel"}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here twice this weekend. The food was good, and the service was excellent (thank you, Brittani). My only complaint is they don't have enough help. When we left to pay our check, there were 7-8 people in line up front - some waiting to be seated, others waiting to pay. Get more help, especially on a holiday weekend. You should have one person dedicated to seating customers and another cashing them out. Who wants to stand in line to pay after you have finished your meal? They get 4 stars from me for the server's friendliness/service and food, but their customer service in the cashier/host area is lacking. Again, this is a management issue and not a reflection on the employees."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night with my family, looking for somewhere different and hoping we'd be pleasantly surprised with Denny's.  We were surprised, just not pleasantly.  There were 2 people working the entire place.  The hostess/manager seated us and took our drink orders, then a waiter served us and cashed us out at the register.  This was not the issue.  The issue was the BUG crawling on my salad.  When I told the waiter, he was nice and apologized and said he'd make me a fresh salad with a fresh bag of greens. Ok, that was a nice.  BUT... if any situation at all calls for a manager to come to your table, I'd say this is the one. I guess the manager was busy with all 2 tables that were seated in the whole place.  When we got our bill, nothing was taken off or discounted.  Not even a dessert offered, nada.  We will not return here."}
{"text":"2nd time in two weeks we went in and were seated and no one ever came to take our order. Not even our drink order. Both times after 15 minutes we got up and left. Funny thing is no one tried to stop us or even noticed we got up and left lol. Say your self the time and dine anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Seated right away. Got our drinks. Ordered. Salads came right out. Food out within ten minutes of being seated. Food tasted great! Friendly server. Great experience. Definitely go back again soon!"}
{"text":"New location. Welcome in Gastonia! Usual fare offered. Service was very good and it appeared they are fully staffed. Nice new facility different from what I have been accustomed to. Not open design. You don't see the kitchen at all. Food was brought fast and was hot and tasty. I made one large mistake, I ordered COFFEE! I forgot that Denny's coffee \"sucks\"! Too strong and bitter. This is the same problem I have encountered at all Denny's. Otherwise a good experience!"}
{"text":"Denny's....what can I say.   I recently opted to eat here late night for some brinner.  My dilemma was deciding on a restaurant with breakfast fare open late night that I didn't have to drive far or have to endure a karaoke set.  Here is where Denny's comes in.    I went with the Grand Slam.  The food was nothing to write home about.  It all tasted pre-manufactured and had zero flavor.  I won't be coming back here no matter what Carrie Underwood cover I have to endure at my more favored establishment."}
{"text":"This is a great Denny's. Food is great, service is friendly and usually very good."}
{"text":"Okay well this Denny's has Always served me well until today .. I come in for a late night meal since I'm heading home now and I order the most SIMPLE order eggs bacon and some hash browns and the lady gives our order to these old people sitting right next to us and she tries to give us the old people's order , and let me tell you , I've been literally waiting 30 mins for my food and the old people finish all of MY food and then they just realize they got the wrong order -.- omg fml and I'm sitting here hungry as hell STILL waiting for my food ugh I don't understand how a waitress can fuck up the orders like that like at least she apologized and said sorry and that our order will be right out , I appreciate her at least apologizing but that's simply just ridiculous I can't believe that , I was thinking of Just leaving but I'll stay because it's late and no place else is open right now such a shame, maybe next time it won't be like this"}
{"text":"Can't say I will ever go back for breakfast.  Ordered a simple two eggs over easy, hashbrown and sausage. The toast had so much margarine on it I actually had to scrap it off. The hashbrown looked nice and crispy until I uncovered the over cooked crispy and over fried underneath. I couldn't even eat the hashbrown. The \"small\" sized over easy eggs were over cooked and had very little yolk. I went to use the bathroom and one of the two toilets were full of toilet paper and shit.  There was even a employee in there that didn't do anything about it. When we went to pay, the girl at the counter asked how our meal was and I mentioned the over cooked hashbrown.  She just said sorry and that was that."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is very rude. The waiter would not even come back to the table to bring us our food. The food was over cooked and the coffee was old. I will never eat at this Denny' s again."}
{"text":"Best Denny's I've ever eaten at. Delicious food and very friendly staff. I suggest going during the day. I had one bad experience going late at night, but the multiple great experiences during the day canceled it out.  Strongly suggest :)"}
{"text":"I just placed a to go order (Fried Cheese Melt) here and the hostess told me it'd be ready in 6 minutes.  I give them an extra 10 minutes before i walk in there to pick it up.  I immediately noticed the dirty carpet I was walking on and that old casino smell.    When I payed for my order I thought I'd be zooming right outta there, but no, the hostess is just now preparing my bag.  I'd understand if it was busy. But it wasn't!  Poor service, 2 stars for the food still being good. Hehehe!!  P.S. This place isn't closed at all."}
{"text":"I love Dennys and when I come back to the states as I am stationed overseas it is on my list. This Dennys has to be one of the worst locations ever. I went Friday with my family and there was hardly any staff and hardly any guests. The GM was at the front and didn't even acknowledge we walked in. After being seated we waited 15 minutes with the waiter passing right by our table and serving people who came after us. After looking at each other in surprise my husband called the GM over to personally take our order. He apologized that he only had one waiter that couldn't handle the tables. ...There were only about four. Not wanting to wait even longer for the food to come out we told him we would try again another day. We then tried Saturday and once again walked in to one server four guests in the whole place and no one at the front. This time however we just walked out. This Dennys needs some serious retraining."}
{"text":"Always our late night restaurant. Good hot tasty food at great prices and mostly good service here every time we've come."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Denny's many times.  I have always really liked this location (5 stars!).  This last couple of visits have been very different.  The staff that work there are veterans!  They have been around for years! I recognize many of these waitresses and used to know them by name (when I lived in the Pittsburgh area).  First was the service; in the past, service has always been A+.  These last few visits, I get the vibe that something is very wrong.  Waitresses seem very unfriendly and miserable (same ladies that have been welcoming and attentive in the past).  Our orders were also messed up.  We had coffee all around.  2 cups were very hot (good!), two cups were ICE cold (?) Two people in my party ordered corn cakes and were given regular cakes.  One person ordered regular cakes and got wheat cakes.  It also felt like pulling teeth to get drinks refilled.    I'm not sure what's going on with this location.  I hope the undo what ever new strategy they are trying and go back to the way it used to be.  I always like this location much better than the location on 51 but may have to give that Denny's a try next time :/"}

{"text":"Had exceptional service on a Friday morning at 9am. We were seated immediately, promptly greeted and taken care of by our waiter. Our order came out in minutes and there wasn't a thing wrong with the order. The place appears new and is super clean. I will return here if I'm in he neighborhood again."}
{"text":"I came with my kids last Sunday. Great, everything was great!  My kids always leave half of the food when we eat out, but on this occasion they even asked for more.  The staff was nice and kind."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Denny's I have ever been to. All these two star one star reviews are people expecting a 5star steak house... The restaurant clean the staff is nice and quick the food is great and you can get a quick meal for cheap without paying much. You really can't go wrong with this location."}
{"text":"This place was cotton picking slow. The service is the worst i have had in Arizona. I feel sorry for the Denys chain. No wonder they are struggling.  Then to top if off they did not have two different entrees. I means seriously who runs out of chicken?   I would suggest picking up old french fries in a McDonalds parking lot before going to this Denny's. Bad."}
{"text":"Horrible food horrible service, burnt gross.....  go elsewhere definitely not a Denny's I'd recommend"}
{"text":"Came here today for a cheap and cheerful brunch...  It's Denny's. A chain restaurant- Exactly what you'd think it is: lots of kids- a simple menu.  But seriously- the service was fantastic (constantly checking if we had enough coffee and making sure we had everything we'd ordered), the lumberjack breakfast was delicious (and substantial), and the price is reasonable. It's been a long time since we had a breakfast that delicious. Did I mention that it's a long weekend and we only waited 5 minutes for a table? We will definitely be back after our next big night out."}
{"text":"This dennys is always halfway good. When I first ate here my hash browns were green and cold, but everything else was good. The second time I came I ordered a skillet dinner with no chicken and they were still trying to charge me the same price which is fine but not for the portion of rice and broccoli they gave me, it was kids size. The third time I ordered the apple pie crisp to go and the portion was extremely small. The host was excusing it with the size of the to go container, which isn't true. My friend ordered the same thing a time before and his portion was perfectly fine. All she offered me was a refund."}
{"text":"So first time coming to this Denny's and for it being a Denny's it wasn't that bad. I had the Cali club with honey jalape√±o bacon (delish). It was a good sandwich they had forgotten the avocado but when I told the waiter he quickly took it back and had them add it. My colleague had the prime rib cob salad which looked really good and he said it was very tasty. The bathrooms were fairly clean my only issue was that there were about 5 or 6 flys and I can understand with the heat that some will fly in but there were just a lot  Overall for a Denny's it was ok"}
{"text":"For a dennys this was a pleasant surprise. I haven't been to a Denny's in a while and when it used to be across the street it was horrible food and horrible service but I decided to try dennys again and glad I did. First of all it's a dennys so don't expect a five star type of meal. However for the service and quality of food I enjoyed my breakfast. Our waitress was super attentive and checked up on us. Our food came out hot and fast. Everything was cooked to our liking. If I am ever in need of a cheap meal I think I will start coming back to dennys. This place is really working on a comeback."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELYTHE WORST  I wasted about two hours of my vacation to get the most Terrible breakfast I have ever had.   The service was poor and the food was cold.  We had to wait 15 minutes to get our pancakes with the rest of our meal and had to ask several times to get a fork, knife and spoon.   Do yourself a favor and walk south a block to McDonald's which I did every day after this horrible experience and you will get a nice hot, quick meal at a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"A Denny's with a five star review? Yup. The staff really works hard to please and the food is really good. This is not my first Denny's meal. But when the staff really cares it makes a huge difference!"}
{"text":"While I was on vacation in Vegas, towards the end of our tripe my girlfriend and I were low on cash and decided that Denny's would be our best option and it sure was. Before that I had been to a Denny's in NJ just once and it was fine. You like that you get a whole lot f food and a damn great price. The food is everything you need it to be and it was one of the best decision of that trip. I'm so glad that there's one in NY now."}
{"text":"Usually this Denny's produces relatively fast however, my party and I had to wait an exceptionally long time.  Add to this numerous families with small kids and... not so good an experience.  Food was slow but ok."}
{"text":"ah , what can you say, Denny's...great place to meet up with a group for breakfast. Ours came out quickly, and not too many mistakes by the waitress, especially considering how busy they were, and how many of us there were.Both of our omelets were good, and nothing was under or over cooked....what do you expect from this place anyway.?"}
{"text":"Day shift is worse. Stopped coming here at nights because the service dropped. Tried coming here today for breakfast and was equally disappointed. Service slow and ignored people to the point others left not even acknowledged. Food was luke warm and bland. Waitress took forever to get drink refills while chatting in back or taking care of \"regulars\". Done with this branch. Going to Elyria only from now on. They at least take care of customers."}
{"text":"Ive been pleasantly surprised and happy with the food and service each time ive been here.  I usually come here with my son and my wifew, but this time was just me and my son.  The server was polite and fast and the food was very good.  I ordered some breakfast, French toast with some eggs, bacon, and a side of hashbrowns while my son ordered some chicken with grapes.  Everything came out fairly quickly and was pretty good.  No major complaints at all."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to stop in here last Sunday for breakfast before church . When we walked in the hostess greeted us and sat us pretty quickly for how busy they were. Our waitresses name was Meg and she was an amazing server. After we received our food the manager Saul came over to ask us how our meal was and to see if we needed a refill on our coffee. I loved the fact that even though they were very busy he still took the time to go up to everyone's table and make sure everything was okay. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The server was great!  Everything else was terrible.  Empty on a Saturday night, tells the whole story."}
{"text":"This dennys has changed a lot in the past 2 months. It appears a new manager or corporate finally came to visit and cleaned the place up. No more mad waitresses or 50 minute waits for 1 plate of food. Way to go."}
{"text":"This Denny's is beautiful lol, I love the decor there's just something about it.   Came in at about 10pm my father and I both ordered steak medium rare and OH MY GOD. It was definitely the best steak we've both ever had. Can you believe it lol! Not fatty at all! And a very decent size for the price!   The red potatos and the squash and zucchini are super delicious!   We both ordered cokes, I took a sip of mine and it tasted hella nasty, like they done mixed it up with all kinds of soda. I didn't want to ask my waitress for another one because she wasn't exactly friendly either. So I sucked it up and just took couple sips.   Just a tip if you go after 10pm they stop serving soup.   When we were done with our meal and were standing by the register to pay, it took a while for someone to come and help us. Other then that and the soda I'd say it was a good dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 burgers and regular fries for a late lunch. They were both cooked as ordered, hot, fresh ingredients, great service, reasonable price, and the cut fries were crispy and fresh, hot and not over cooked or over salted. Great job!"}
{"text":"This isn't about this restaurant in general, but it's about the chain itself.   The current menu absolutely sucks.   They don't have baked potatoes or side salads as sides for what pitiful choices they have for the so called dinner menu.   Dennys used to be great, but all this place seems to focus on is breakfast and burgers anymore."}
{"text":"Its Friday night summertime mid July in Vegas morning  and Denny's is cranking out platinum plates. Waitresses could reflect more on the cooks meaning given A1 service to any and everybody like the cooks. Other than that location, Dennys strongly gets a 4"}
{"text":"First clue:  When you walk in the door, it smells like a hot Mumbai afternoon.  Second clue:  Accosted by beggars looking for leftover biscuits and gravy.  Third clue:  Three sets of utensils later, and still nothing without fake egg caked on it.  Fourth clue:  The food.  I actually liked Denny's too.  Franchisees completed ruined most of them though.  AVOID."}
{"text":"We always eat here for breakfast the food is excellent. But today the service was bad. Our waitress only visit our table once. Well let's just say she didn't get a tip. Believe me I'm a good tipper  if you give me good service I will tip you handsomely.  At least she could of acknowledged  us."}
{"text":"We had just gotten done at the gym and work pretty much starving and Denny's was the only place that was open. We ended up getting a Santa Fe skillet and Andreas the server suggested that we split it into skillets. We were just going to get an extra plate, but we went with his suggestion. We added extra chicken on the side. The skillet was so delicious and it was almost like getting two meals in one because both skillets came very full. The Santa Fe skillet comes with chorizo potatoes onions Bell peppers."}
{"text":"Oh the new lows we have reached.  I thought the grand slam would have atleast rewarded us after we waited 15 min. to get the attention of the waitress. Looks like she could have had better days. I think she covered 15 tables at once, poor old woman looks like she should be retiring and getting rid of that nasty sunburn, not serving bacon and eggs.  The glasses of water we got (which had a funny taste), looked like they had boogers on it. I am amazed we didn't dash out the door that instant. I guess you can call us brave.   The 'grandslam' isn't so 'grand'. Atleast, not like it used to be. Now I know why they only charged a couple bucks for it, because if you combined it together, it'd be the size of my palm. Mmmm, nothing like soggy hashbrowns, sausages that screamed mystery meat, and chairs with rips and holes for decor. Urgh..I'm acting feeling itchy from thinking about it.."}
{"text":"1 star just because I ate, the food did its job and I am no longer hungry. If the service was any slower I would've gone back in time. The food was satisfactory other than the fact that it was somewhat cold. Wouldn't come back or recommend this location."}
{"text":"We arrived at 1140 pm and had excellent service. The food was good and our waiter, Scott was beyond  excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst (slowest) service I've ever had at a Denny's. Food came out cold. Took over 10 minutes for us to be able to get anyone's attention to get new food. Drinks were only refilled once and had sat there empty for quite a while. Once done eating, took another 15 or so minutes to get our bill...needless to say, we almost walked out. Will definately not return to this location."}
{"text":"Invisible management and inexperienced staff.  Waited for 20 mins at 1:00 to be seated. The hostess was ignoring everyone waiting to be seated (13 people) as she cashed out those waiting to leave. She did not stop and no one came to help though the small lobby was packed with those waiting and there were at least 6 visible waitresses. The manager was in the back ignoring the issue. He popped his head out and then immediately went back to his office. There were at least 17 empty tables that were available when we walked it.  Finally got seated and ordered. The waitress didn't know what a French dip was (at Denny's?). And didn't know what a patty melt was either. We asked for another waitress.    No plans to come back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Won't let me rate at zero star. Horrible to nonexistent service. Have had numerous issues with not having bread or lettuce....Will never recommend or go to ever again"}
{"text":"Denny's has expanded their menu to the point where they are now a force to be reckon with for this class of restaurant. Fresh spinach as a side? I think so. Also, be sure to try red potato side - some of the best I've ever had. Think crispy, hot and fresh and goes great with tobasco.  $1.99 for a bowl of their chicken noodle soup with your entree? Hell yes! Much better quality than canned soup or even the fresh deli soups in the supermarkets. The chicken tender dinner is my go to menu item of choice. I've dined here twice in the last month and I have greatly enjoyed myself both times. Sure, you'll occasionally have to contend with the coughing and wheezing elderly person or obnoxious kid, but overall I give the big thumbs up for approval. Throw in an occasional coupon or one of their specials - it's an outright bargain."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast around 8am on a Sunday. Not very busy but the waiter was very attentive to our needs. We ordered breakfast burrito with hash browns and toast, and sausage griddle platter that came with sausage links, 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and hashbrowns with two drinks was under 15.00!! Was very good and filling. The restaurant was clean and fast."}
{"text":"Second time here and second time disappointed with the bad service. Restaurant not busy at 10pm but it seems like there are only two servers doing everything. After sitting five minutes at my table, the waitress who had passed me three different times finally yelled at me from behind the counter that she would be right with me. Customer service skills by her needed tweaking as she did not have any type of interaction did not say hello did not apologize that I was waiting and basically said \"what can I get you\" when she finally came to the table.  my drink was refilled only one time and she never came by during the mean to ask how everything was. Brought the bill and just sat it down without saying anything. Needless to say if you get the tall red head that looks pregnant move to a different section.  Breakfast food I ordered was good, however second time service was negative"}
{"text":"Food was ok. I would rather have good old fashipness diner food. They need new carpets badly."}
{"text":"First time making a to-go order for this location, definitely will be the last, customer service was lack luster when picking up my order. Cashier asks if i'm leaving her a tip or not, before i even received my order. Food was even more lack luster. Ordered a Bourbon burger with no onions with french fries and a chicken breast sandwich with seasoned fries and jalape√±os...well i got a Bourbon burger full of jalape√±os and a chicken breast sandwich with hours old seasoned fries. Definitely will not recommend nor will be returning."}
{"text":"Easter Sunday and we have had the worst experience at Denny's ever Tables that need to be bussed Rude hostess Rude waiter Only shining star was Merced  Will update once we have the food   We had to request someone take our order otherwise we will still be waiting"}
{"text":"Friendly, quick, and clean service for a late night take out order while staying at the Crowne Plaza nearby. The Moons Over My Hammy was perfect. Great for any late night craving situation."}
{"text":"Omg.  Shoutout to server George . Excellent customer service. Went back again for two days and asked for George .   Remembered what we ate the day before . Sat at the window overlooking the mirage volcano."}
{"text":"Service is kinda slow here... Especially during breakfast. I usually get the grand slam when I come here (because all my friends want to gather for breakfast) and it takes more than 40 minutes for them to come with food... Drinks wait at least 15 minutes..."}
{"text":"No matter what Denny's I'm at They suck! the waitresses need some REAL training. If they ever want to make anything decent . I watch my food sit for 15+ minutes before it gets to me. But it's 2am and nobody else is here. Just rude! 0 starts! Get it together Denny's"}
{"text":"As a server myself I'm always very observant about what's going on inside the restaurant. I start nit picking on every detail.  I understand it's diner food, can't expect much; but there are still some great items. My food came out cold. Not once did the server drop by. I was already half way done, I honestly didn't want to make a big deal about it because I had just gotten off a late swing shift at 2am. I was starving!! He was behind his station on his phone watching videos with his buddy.  Whatever man, not everyone that comes in is an asshole. I'm sure they get that a lot. But you never know who you're serving, and not every industry people are going to be nice about it but I let it slide, only because I had a great night at my job.   I've had better service at the Coronado cafe after hours at southpoint, and that's for $4 steak n eggs. Won't be stopping in here again, I'd rather try my luck back at southpoint.   I wish more wait staff members would start acting like they cared more about their jobs. Your customers pay your bills!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the server, Scott, was one of the best ones I've ever had.  He is on the top of his game.  I will come here again!  And will recommend."}
{"text":"First visit. Internet strength was so poor I couldn't connect. Main reason I chose dennys.   Second visit. Ordered take out. Felt bad because I couldn't tip as there was no signature needed and because I never carry cash. Turned out they didn't include plasticware or napkins.   Other than those minor complaints the food was as good as Denny 's gets.   Not the best Dennys I've eaten at."}
{"text":"No wonder seats arent filled up at this dennys. The waiter was very unhappy and seemed like  he hated his job. Service was bad. Food was very bland. They charged one of my friends wrong. Added an extra  oj to his bill. Never coming here again! !! Stay away. P.s bathrooms had blood on the walls and no toilet paper !!"}
{"text":"My 2 friends and I all ordered the biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns. All the biscuits hard as a rock, none of them had enough gravy, my eggs were overcooked, 2 of us had raw hash browns, the servers didn't seem too really care. We did however get our billed reduced. Not recommended."}
{"text":"OMG! Worst experience I ever had at a restaurant in my entire life. This morning at 4:45am my sister and I walked into this VERY empty Dennys and upon arrival the waitress literally said, \"Are you sure you want to eat here?\" And my initial reaction was, \"WTF is it sanitary?\" She says,\"yea but we had a rush\"   Who says this to someone entering a restaurant??? So we immediately turned around and went across the street to IHOP"}
{"text":"The food here is always good, I have been going to this location for the past 15 years, the have recently renovated the place and it is very nice. People hate on Dennys in general but I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"It's Denny's. It is remodeled and clean. The waiters was nice. It's Denny's. I don't like the fact they have a annex that looks closed from the hotel entrance. It makes the place look sketchy"}
{"text":"Sat at the counter for over an hour while others came in after us and then got served, and we continue waiting, no food.  Got up and left, complained to the manager, he could care less.. never going to another Denny's"}
{"text":"Worst service on Sunday, not the waitress fault she had zero help we waited 30 min for coffee with no sugar packets on table after we asked, wobbly table waited just about an hour after we ordered for food. Worst Denny's ever, we go there because you can expect a certain level of service and quality, not the case with this one. Even it being a smaller Denny's maybe 20 tables max and they could not keep up. It sucked majorly!"}
{"text":"Horrible service almost an hour to get our food.  NO discount on our food, but yet the manager had no problem sitting at the counter eating his pot roast.  Not once came by to apologize or comp food.  Complained to corporate office and got a generic all purpsoe email.  Umm yeah about the $25 I blew for bad service, cold food, and attitude.  I was starting to turn my attitude about Denny's thinking they were doing better but they proved they aren't.  THings happen, but when the corporate office can't even call to apologize that is saying we don't care."}
{"text":"Went to Denny's on Leavitt Rd and our service was so bad when we walked in we left before even being seated. My boyfriend and I walked in And there were a few people sitting on the bench and we waited at the podium to put our name in but nobody ackowledged us. A manager walked passed us 3 times and didn't say a word so we just sat on the bench with others waiting. Finally she came over and said who is next? So she took them and say them and while she did that 2 other couples walked in and had the same experience. They were waiting to put a name in and the same manager walked right past them. They turned to each other and were talking about it. Finally she comes back to them and seats them right away when we had been waiting for 10 minutes already. This was absolutely awful service especially coming from a manager. I've worked in restaurants and this was unacceptable. When someone walks in you need to greet them right away especially when you're standing right there and clearly see them. If she was busy all she had to do was say \"I'll be with you in one moment\" but she acted like we didn't exist. We just left and went to Bob Evans where we were welcomed with a friendly greeting as soon as we walked in. Denny's needs to train their management team on some customer service skills."}
{"text":"Three of us went in for breakfast. waitress takes our order and nothing happens for 20 minutes. O I forgot to mention there were only 3 other tables with customers. So she decides to show up and mention !/2 of my order is out of stock.  REALLY! 20 minutes! So I ask for a menu and she never returns, so I go off to the kitchen myself and tell the cook what I want instead.Another 15 minutes and I call the manager over who tells me they are having trouble with the waffle machine. REALLY! 15 minutes and no one can tell us this.So 2 of us change our order again. If it hadn't been for the manager comping the entire meal I would have camped in the parking lot and bad mouthed the place. They need to train the servers better, she could have handled the whole thing so much better. I understand shit happens, but it can't be ignored. need I say she didn't get a penny from our table."}
{"text":"Went at 11pm on a saturday and ordered the all you can eat pancakes with extra butter and jelly. Tammie J was our server and she did a great job. Fast service and quick to give us whatever we wanted/needed. I will be coming back and hope I get Tammie J again. I've had bad experiences at other Dennys due to horrible servers getting my orders wrong and not giving me water when I needed/wanted it, but this place has got itself an amazing worker that deserves a raise. She took care of us and several other tables at the same time and took great care of us all like a true pro. I like how they had basketball playing on all the televisions and the restaurant was pretty clean. I'm glad I live close to this Dennys. I wont have to go far for good food and service.  6\23\17 - had a great exerience with Nicole M as our server. We ordered a whole lot of things and she got everything right. Not a single mistake and nothing was forgotten even the extra butter and extra salsas on the side were brought out without us having to mention it again, wish every server was like that. I enjoyed our visit and will be coming back again. Hope we get Nicole M again next time. The quesidillas and pancakes were awesome. All 6 cups of coffee were great too! Service was fast. Water, coffee and soda refills were done well too. She would ask us if we wanted more when we had just a little left in our cups. Nicole is very attentive and a great worker. She deserves a raise."}
{"text":"Kind of suck when u have to wait forever on a Tuesday , along with not have your food brung out together . Along with u telling them u are allergic to tomatoes and they still put in omelet ."}
{"text":"Most Dennys are bad you kinda expect them to be bad but this one I think they go out of their way to train their staff to be exceptionally bad. I've seen servers fight homeless people servers smoke outside the front door and run to my table to try to take my order reeking of cigarettes. Some of the servers scream through the entire restaurant & seem like they are in a constant state of chaos. The food is always worse than a normal Dennys too. If you're into seeing drug deals go down in front of you & servers who can't be bothered to help you than this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Our waitress grossed me out because she has really dirty fingernails. And she also has a bad attitude like she is not happy to be here"}
{"text":"Cmon guys, bust down the doors.  Perfect location for all you \"taking the bridge\".  Psst, hint.....don't know why they even have a menu, you can build anything your heart desires, all you have to do is ask.  Love challenging the cook and manager who happens to be on duty."}
{"text":"I always stay at the Wynn/Encore and this Denny's is right next door. It is my favorite place to walk to and take care of my hang over. The servers are really great and hardworking. The food is always hot and so damn good! I am always so happy to go here with my friends."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this Denny's almost every weekend, but I recently haven't been doing so, because I'm getting a bit sick of the bad service and filthy establishment. There are never open tables when we arrive, so we usually have to wait about twenty minutes to be seated. Most of workers are friendly, but there are a few who have a very nasty attitude and provide poor service. The food is good, but it does take a long time for it to get to our table, and usually our order is incomplete or wrong. The decorations are tacky, the booths and tables are never well cleaned, and the bathrooms are just disgusting."}
{"text":"They dont answer their phone. Makes it hard to call and place an order... called 7 times. Phone still ringing when I arrived. Cynthia said the phone doesn't work. I pressed redial and watched and heard the phone ring. Poor customer service poor attitude all around poor experience. I'll be back for a refund."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  Large portions and cheap.  Open 24/7 as all Denny's nationwide are and closes on very few if any holidays."}
{"text":"Where do I begin this was a horror show from the start we walked in and were seated fairly quickly after the lady seating us was very brash about her feelings towards her job ... just wait we then were greeted by our waitress who was pretty polite she took our drink orders and came back about 5 mine later and proceeds to take our food order ( mind you we are a party of two ) in the meantime all we could hear are people complaining about waiting all around us one of the poor servers was running 4-5 tables and the only one who cared to greet the people coming in as well, the phone was nonstop ringing without anyone answering it ... I don't know about you but a nonstop ringing phone really sets me off on top of already being in a uncomfortable situation.... the guy at the table next to us literally got up to fill his own soda and it was at this point we knew we were probably in for it. The waitress way pretty good about asking for refills as it had been about 30 or so minutes now. Another 30 minutes goes by and all the party's around us had received their food including a few that arrived after we were sat we ordered the most common and basic breakfasts on the menu so were left to think it could of only gone to someone else. Our waitress told us we were next and literally after 15-20 minuets everyone else's food was coming out all around us. We finally received our food and literally a perfect half of my hash browns were scraped away and on my partners plate you could literally see the line on mine and the upside down tangled mess on her plate. At this point I felt it was useless to even say anything as I was not going to wait any longer ps I'm still try to figure out if my sandwich was wrong. Our food was so greasy it literally was sliding around on the plate. My parters pancakes were so undercooked there was a hole in the middle where they slapped some butter in and called it a day. Needless to say I will no longer be supporting Denny's as a breakfast spot as to the last time I was there my waitress brought me out a iced tea with a ripped piece of a sweet and low package in it so if this is what service means to them I'll gladly take my money elsewhere all things aside if you are understaffed or you know your tables are waiting a long time at least take the time to apologize and keep them in the loop it goes a long way."}
{"text":"I've been burned by the service here before but this is the first time I've dealt with getting served in dirty dishes and at a dirty table. The waitress had us waiting for a while to seat us without a word, sat is at a sticky table, was quick with our order like she was in a hurry...there are only a couple other tables with people here, served me milk in a glass that had food stuck inside it, didn't ask if we wanted anything else before dropping the check in on us and walking away. The only reason we came here was for a dessert and our usual late night date place, IHOP, didn't have much of a dessert selection. I don't think we'll be coming to this Dennys again."}
{"text":"Did an online order for pick up, got home and only received half of my order. The half we did receive was horrible. Not to mention the lady working the front when I walked in seemed very cranky and didn't even greet me. Called in for a refund, was placed on hold for 10+ minutes so had to hand up and call back. Would not recommend this Denny's.  Also, I tried submitting a review on their website with the link they sent to my email but it wouldn't actually let me submit it."}
{"text":"You can talk all the trash you want about Denny's, but I am not going to hear any of it.  Every time Ive needed a meal, at any time, Denny's does not fail me.  Our waitress was awesome this time.  She was the best.  Not only did she make our morning but we hope we made hers.  We had 4 kids and 3 adults in our party.  We are a hungry, mildly crazy group when we are hungry.  I ordered the Fit Slam.  It has spinach, cherry tomatoes with Turkey Bacon.  All in an omelette style presentation.  I found my son loves Turkey Bacon.  He hates the fatty white part on regular bacon.  So Turkey Bacon is a great replacement.  Of course we also had the other meals of piles of pancakes, syrup, chocolate milks and regular bacon.  All was delicious, all was served fast.  We appreciated the experience and thank you Denny's for keeping it consistent."}
{"text":"Today was our first time to have breakfast at Denny's at this location I've had Denny's in many cities in many countries The waiter today was name Rene, absolutely incredible service In fact I told Rene he should go around from restaurant to restaurant and wait staff on how to serve Kumar the manager came over to see her breakfast was. Now I know why this location is better than the rest good waitstaff great management  The food also was piping hot very tasty"}
{"text":"In preparation for a Vegas list I am putting together for future reference, I am back tracking on this review from a few years ago when I saw U2 and spent a few days in Vegas. Sometimes you need the basics for cheap and this is where this falls into place. Every time I do Denny's I just need a good cheap breakfast, the simple things. Compared to the other buffets and stuff it isn't the greatest but it works with my needs. I don't drink, therefore, this is great for people watching and observing all the idiots with their hang overs clinging to their coffees for dear life."}
{"text":"Long wait for a menu, long wait for water. Server was wonderful if not overwhelmed by how busy it was. Food was 4/5, onions ended up in omelet which made me not eat parts of it."}
{"text":"Came here with friends a family and i ordered the ceasor salad and the chicken portion was miniscule .. I  ordered a side of sausage to get my extra protein in .. i waited and waited, i asked 2 times for my sausage after it was ordered. By the time it was ready my party and I had to leave. Very bad service. I had to leave hungry..  dont eat here.."}
{"text":"This dennys location has never let us down. We always try to ask for a young lady named Krystal. She gives great service fast and always correct. The cooks do a great job. It clean and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I've probably visited here more than 50 times, and almost every time the service and food are impeccable. Kudos to the manager or hiring manager. The servers are always pleasant. It is conveniently located as well. Once again, love love love!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all. Ended up getting food poisoning on my first time going to this Denny's restaurant. I ordered one of their skillet breakfasts and apparently the food was bad. Right away I had a upset stomach and cramps really bad. I tried not throw up but couldn't hold it down any longer and it came up. Then the Diarrhea came and lasted for two and a half days. There was pork in my meal that had to be bad. You never want to get sick on pork, it's the worse!   Then when I was feeling better and not sick I went back and talked to the manager and told her about my bad experience with their food and she told me I should of gone to the hospital and didn't even offer to reimburse me for my meal. She just had a matter fact attitude about it and walked away. No sorry or anything. Just you should of gone to the hospital so we could track the issue but other that we can't help you. . Unbelievable. Please don't go there if you value you life.   I can't even give this a one star, It's a ZERO STAR."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at the Denny's! my experience was so good that our server Moriah made accommodations to my meal I had my. Thank you Mariah for such a funny energetic personality Great service"}
{"text":"Love going to this spot after work. I always get 2 cheese quesadillas and hash browns and end up paying only 8 dollars in total. Sometimes i also order something called apple crisp for dessert. It's delicious! It comes with apples, pie crust, caramel and ice cream. Food is made quick and well."}
{"text":"Great service and food. The best looking Denny's restaurant I've been to. Today I had the banana and pecan pancakes with hashbrowns and scrambled eggs and it was delicious! We've been coming here ever since we moved to fountain hills like a year and a half ago. They actually have sugar free syrup and they sell beers now!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service is pretty bad here. I waited over 40 minutes for a desert that never came. I had to tell the lady at the register to take it off the check since I never got it. This place needs new management and new servers."}
{"text":"$25 for an almost two hours wait time for food that was undercooked, from slimy eggs, to raw in the middle pancakes, to cold hash browns. Our waitress even know this was a huge mess, as she never once asked me how anything was, just produced a check and called it a day. Worst dining experience of my life and I would recommend anyone ever going here."}
{"text":"After a long overnight drive out to Arizona, it's nice to start your day with a hearty meal from a chain restaurant that you trust.  Got myself a good old omelette to my liking with some meat and vegetables.  Thank you Denny's!"}
{"text":"Worse Denny's I've ever been. Cold food horrible service, by the time we got creamer the coffee was cold. Didn't bring syrup or butter. Have to ask multiple times for everything. The silver wear was gross ! Left over food on my fork(which we had to grab ourselves from an empty table) DO NOT COME HERE !?!"}
{"text":"Well to sum up this visit; The food was mostly cold. My Mom and I watched as food sat under the heating lamp for more than 5 minutes. The coffee was old and not very hot. Food isn't fully cooked. My English muffin was hardly toasted. Just tasted like bread and butter.  As terrible as the food was, the service was nice. Our server was Luis and he was very attentive. That's the only reason I gave a second star because he did his job well. The cooks just need to get it together."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on our last day in Las Vegas.  Service was fast and all the waiters were kind!  I ordered steak breakfast it was worth it. Cooked well and I enjoyed as much as I could fit in my mouth. Our waiter was a little over worked. She was handling tables inside and outside on her own. But she still managed to hold it down. Our waiter was Ozlem P. She was so nice and friendly. I would come again. Love Denny locations in Vegas. They always have alcohol."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, it takes forever to get seated, the servers are lazy and slow."}
{"text":"Food was so delicious!!! Our waiter, David, was attentive and friendly. Could've been a little cleaner. We will be returning :)"}
{"text":"It took a good while to get seated and they weren't busy. I never got a single refill on my drinks. I was going to order dessert but she brought me my check without asking if I was finished or wanted anything else. The food was good and exactly what I ordered, so that's why I didn't give them one star."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received from a server. It was so slow and the server asked if I wanted coffee twice and never brought it. The manager was kind and brought me coffee and creamer. Won't be coming to this location again"}
{"text":"Very happy with this Denny's. My family and I are regulars at this diner franchise and we've had our bad experiences. This was not one of them.   To start with, I really want to praise our server Elisa. She was so unbelievably friendly and helpful. My sister had food poisoning and Elisa noticed and brought out a soda water and Sprite for her, on the house. She even went as far as giving us a Sprite to-go and a few take out bags in case my sister threw up on the road. We didn't even have to ask for the soda and she was just so unbelievably kind to us. It was really refreshing. And she kept checking on my sister to see if she was feeling better. It was so sweet at how kind she was to us.   We ordered breakfast plus a few different dishes. I'm a fan of the loaded potato skillet from their value menu--it's a good amount of food for only $8. And it bursts with flavor too. Cheesy goodness mm.   Overall, I've been to this Denny's twice and I've never been disappointed with the food. The first time our service wasn't that great but this visit definitely made up for everything. Thank you so much Elisa!"}
{"text":"Very bad service , waited for more than an hour for the food. The silverware  was dirty as well the table . When paying for the drinks the manager had a bad attitude and got mad because didn't want to stay longer to keep waiting for the  food"}
{"text":"Breakfast service at this location is outstanding. The food preparation is also very well done. In response to asking for diet syrup the waitress said, \"of course\" with a smile. Even though she was very busy, she provided service like she owned Denny's."}
{"text":"I had to change my review from 5 stars to just 1 star after my second visit here. Last time I had a great experience when Brianna G was our server. This time we had a different server, her name was Joetta W and I will never come back again after this experience. I ordered the build your own burger. I asked for a veggie burger well done with caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a cheddar bun with onion rings on the side. I was brought a veggie burger with bourbon sauce on top and my barbecue sauce had a piece of meat in it. I hate bourbon sauce and never even asked for it so how I got that is unexplainable. I'm a vegetarian that ordered a veggie burger so why they thought I wanted meat in my barbecue sauce is besides me. I informed the server that I wanted everything redone the way I had asked from the beginning. 25 minutes later I was brought a new plate with half of the amount of onion rings on it and my veggie burger didn't have the cheese or caramelized onions I asked for. After the 2nd mess up I told the server, Joetta that I was no longer interested in eating anything at the restaurant any longer since they seem to be incapable of getting an order right. I definitely didn't want special sauce for being \"difficult\" when really they were just messing up left and right. Maybe it was for the best that things happened the way it did. I swear there was a hint of some type of cleaning liquid in my water. This is the worst Denny's experience I have ever had in my life. I'm just going to pretend this location is called something else and never step foot in it again."}
{"text":"Hey Its Denny's For the price you cant go wrong, this is for me a breakfast place not a fan of there dinners.  Our server was ok she forgot our toast and syrup, and took a long time to come back with it."}
{"text":"The food is terrible..the pancakes taste like rubber and the hash browns were cold,  also the bacon taste like it's been washed and rung out.  The waiter was great too bad the food wasn't.  Wont b coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Nice selection on the menu. Prompt and courteous service. Recommend it for a non-casino restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited long time and in the end, the food was prepared badly and not in the order we requested!  They just throw the food on the plate and bring you and charge $12-15 for each! I'd rather pay few dollars more and go to better place! But this is what i get when its is 1am ! Bad food"}
{"text":"Went to this Denny's a few weeks ago and here is the breakdown  Service 3/5 The waiter was nice, very polite, it wasn't overly busy but he seemed to disappear for extended periods of time, I wanted to order a drink but had to wait about 5-7 minutes before I could flag him down.   Food 2.5/5 I ordered the t-bone steak with hashbrowns and fries, I asked for the steak to be well done but it looked like it was very very well done, very dry and I could not eat it without pouring hot sauce and ketchup on it however, the milkshake was great, the waiter brought the glass he made the milkshake in  addition to the 1 glass I ordered (he said he made a little extra and didn't want it to go to waste so he offered me the extra)  Atmosphere 3.5/5 Well lit, clean and the tables were nicely set up (not too much privacy but whatever)   Will probably go back there just to give them another try... I still believe the t-bone steaks are great there - they just need to be cooked to my likings ;)"}
{"text":"Because a Sante Fe skillet is like a curveball that can blindside a dinner appetite, I decided to pull over on a whim on this Dennys on West Sahara.  And because it is Sunday night, this diner has the making of an Edward Hopper set-up: dimly lit parking lot, almost empty and uninviting seats and decors (I was there with two couples who looks like they have the same feeling of indifference towards food and maybe life in general), the counter and the kitchen are stripped of busyness that I normally see on a breakfast scene.... Yes, what a relief when a Hispanic family came in later and the hungry noisy well-dressed kids are eager to eat after services from church.  There's one greeter, one server and one cook that night, and I commend them for managing it through the tedium. They try their best to smile and pour coffee on refill cups and not realize they are exactly the age-old characters on Hopper's NIghthawks, including me."}
{"text":"Went to Denny's after attending a meeting, There was 12 people in our party. So why am I reviewing Denny's? We all know what Denny's is about. Well when you're with friends, this is definitely a great place to go!  Food is good and satisfying. With Denny's people always seem to have a love-it or hate-it opinion of the chain.  Tonight for our party of 12 we had our drinks were delivered in a reasonable amount of time given the amount of people in our party and my food was ordered and delivered in about 15-20 minutes with the exception of one order that got delivered after most of us had eaten. On a good note the manager comp'd that meal which was nice if her to do.  We all had requested separate checks and there was no problem making that request. I would like to give our waitress a lot of recognition for working with our large party.  Nothing special about this Denny's.... I have no complaints and the food was brought quick enough and the order was right so it's all good.  FOOD: The food was hot and fresh out of the kitchen, it wasn't cold when it got to me, which made me happy.  The quality of the food was decent too.  There's not much to say about this place though, because the menus are all the same at all Denny's.  The point being: a Denny's is a Denny's is a Denny's, but some are better than others. This one is decent.  PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:   Excellent.  AMBIANCE:  Typical Denny's. CONCLUSION:  We were seated immediately. Food was decent, everything that should have been hot was. Service was great. RETURN  FACTOR: 100%"}
{"text":"The commercials again got me into Denny's, along with a late night visitor arrival. The pancakes have a new formula and it works well. They won't top any local favorite place, but my pumpkin variety had a nice pumpkin cream and some dense pumpkin flavored pancakes. The regular version is only $2 for two large pancakes and also good stuff. The only other thing tried was an excellent $2 cheese quesadilla with a good smattering of pico de gallo. Pancakes were always the go-to item at Denny's for me and now more than ever that will continue."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's ever avoid going anytime past 10pm.. Or ever. So this is my story. My boyfriend and I decided to go to Denny's because we wanted something different and cheap on the late night.. other than Taco Bell. It took about 10 mins to be seated even though it wasn't many customers and the employees were just standing around. Ok so it was time to order the waitress was friendly and was training another waiter in the progress. We didn't mind. My boyfriend requested a drink on the menu that wasn't there and she attempted to make it. He liked it lol.. So we ordered nachos and she told us there weren't any beef for the nacho so I requested chicken. She said \"sure I can do that\" she finished with the order and went to the back. Ok so here were it went south. The chef/cook cussed out our waitress and threatened her life. It sounded  like a fight would've started any minute. She (the cook) started dropping f bombs and just been hateful towards our waitress. Our waitress came back and told us that the manger would cook the food. I asked her what happened. And she had let us know that because we requested chicken the cook got pissed. I asked will there be any action because she threaten your life. The waitress said no because she is very loved here. So after that, the cook left to go home early and we paid and tipped generously. Believe that I will never return. The waitress was great but that cook just rubbed me the wrong way!!!"}
{"text":"i have been here numerous times and it is what you'd expect from a Denny's.  Food is okay and reasonably priced.  I am writing this review though due to the terrible service I received/ did not receive last night.  I attempted to order something to go over the phone and was immediately put on hold.  This is okay they may have been busy.  But I could hear everything in the restaurant which included the gentleman who answered the phone joking around and shouting liar at I assume another employee.  If you are able to do this you could have taken a quick order.  After being disconnected I attempted to call back and got a busy signal.  I presume the phone was off the hook.  I know it is just a Denny's, but in a neighborhood that struggles to get business you'd think some effort would be paid to service."}
{"text":"Went out to breakfast a couple days ago with my boyfriend. When we were seated in our booth I noticed a bloody bandage on the floor directly in front of our booth. I informed our waitress, Carmen, when she came back to take our order. She seemed unconcerned, saying she would sweep it up. We both ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast. When our food arrived 45 minutes later, both sets of eggs were Cold, there were egg shells in mine and a short black hair in my gravy. Also, Carmen who never checked on us even once, never bothered to clean up that disgusting bandage. Dirty establishment, terrible customer service and below average food. Save your money."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I went to Denny's while in Tempe for the weekend. It was located right by our hotel. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. The food was also good. I ordered one of the skillets and I was really impressed. If you are staying at the double tree hotel in Tempe, give Denny's a try."}
{"text":"I thought this Denny's deserves a five star! There was only one hostess and one waiter and they were hustling and I think they did a good job! The food is always decent."}
{"text":"Plenty of open seats. Waited fifteen minutes with no service. No Denny's is worth waiting that long. Got up and left."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Denny's in years and my first time here at this location. Honestly, it will be one of my last tunes visiting in the morning.  The wait was not long when we arrived. I only waited about so minutes to be seated.   Our service was so slow. Our server completely forgot the order and drinks. I ordered the omelette and my friend got pancakes. The pancakes came out quickly but I waited at least 45 minutes for the omelette to come out. The food was decent."}
{"text":"Just keeps on going downhill, can't get an order right, takes forever to get the wrong order and is cold when you receive the wrong order."}
{"text":"Fifteen minutes no server they aren't that busy, no management at all this is by far the worst I've been to, just want some breakfast late in the day"}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. The food will never look like the picture. The service will be underwhelming at best. The prices will always be too high for what you get. But with the 2-for-1 entree coupon (check out any area weekly magazine), it's not bad. And I kinda like their skillets. This location can have a long wait on weekends, so be prepared for that. It's never usually too bad (10-15 mins), though, for a table for 2. All in all with a coupon and a hankering for a skillet, Denny's will hit the spot."}
{"text":"For a Saturday morning this place was surprisingly quiet and not busy. Our server was kind and efficient. The food came out quickly and everything was just as we ordered it."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this Dennys since it opened. We have had consistent food quality and some excellent staff/service.   The last two visits have been less than good. Last visit with my daughter, the food was not good, but the server was average. Seemed like they cooked up the smallest chicken strips in the bag and cooked them to death. She refuses to complain, so she just ate the \"chicken jerky.\"  This visit, the hostess seated us at a wet table. It had been wiped down but was still very wet. Hubby asked waiter for a towel to wipe away the water and he argued with him. The waiter brought the napkins,  hubs wiped the table and scrubbed the sticky spots and stuck on food off of the table. He left the napkin exposed to show the waiter. The waiter argued that it was the sanitizing solution. Really?   I ordered 4 eggs, scrambled hard. They came slimy and only 2 eggs. I sent them back. Got 4 eggs. Still slimy. Sent back again. Now the rest of my food is cold. I am angry. Not a great experience.   They get 2 stars because my hubby's food was just fine."}
{"text":"Saturday morning breakfast. .no wait. Had Britney as a server. She had our waters and our order in under 5 minutes.  Our food came out in about 10 minutes.  Pretty good considering that its early on Saturday am. But this place isn't packed? Anyway the food was fine..it is Dennys so dont go crazy."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet: If you are in any type of hurry then this is not the establishment for you.    I arrived at 10:25AM on a Tuesday and the place looks cute.  A little busy but clean.  I assumed I'd get my order in, food, and eat within half an hour since it's breakfast and takes no time at all to cook and Denny's is known for average quality breakfast food quickly.    Nope.  Friendly but sweet girl takes my order for a skillet and an iced tea and twenty minutes later, still no food.  I tell her I now need it to go and another FIVE minutes later I get my food.  I head up to the register and when the hostess asks how everything was and I inform her politely that it took a long time and that I now have to rush to my meeting holding my breakfast she is COMPLETELY indifferent.    Will not return."}
{"text":"After taking a friend to the airport before sunrise, I needed someone to have breakfast before work. Unfortunately not many places are open at 5:30am. Disgruntally I decided to go to Denny's. That being said I was pleasantly surprised.   Denny's is what it is, and you always know what you are getting. But my classic Benny was really good. Eggs were cooked perfectly, hollaindase was just right. The kitchen had even fried up the hame so it was warm and crispy - not what I was expecting. Potatoes were freshly cooked and just the right crispy.   Service was prompt and friendly. I was reading my book too, so when I was done, after about 15 minutes the waiteress came by and put my bill down letting me know I was welcome to stay as long as I liked and no need to rush. Something small, but a really nice gesture. Had asked for a refill on the hot water for my tea which came promptly too.  Maybe it is just because I walked in with lower expectations, but I was really impressed. So impressed that I will absolutely stop in at this Denny's again for breakfast.  Thanks to the great staff and cooks for making a ridiculously early start to my day so much better."}
{"text":"My home lived very close by This place.I went to this place with my friend at middle night because we were hungry.we have been going to this restaurant a lot but the last when we went there,ewkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. the floor smell just gross. no I should say the whole restaurant smell sooooo gross.we told the waitress that smell very bad,and she told us they are going to remodeling.I hope they do good on remolding otherwise I am not going back again !!!!! and they going to lose more business."}
{"text":"Denny's. It is what it is. But given how rarely I go...they seem to have a brand-new menu each time I am there...so that's fun."}
{"text":"If I could give a Zero I would. This is the worst Dennys in AZ. Every time I have been there, there is no one working and they have ridiculously slow service. Food is very sub par. I would not recommwnd anyone go here. Crackel Barrel is right down the road. Go there. So much better."}
{"text":"I've been to many Denny's but this one is closest to my house. I'll make it short, the food just tastes average, the prices are high for what they are, but my god, the service everytime. The most recent time, I JUST got seated and the server asked what I wanted. Like excuse me, I didn't even open the damn menu yet. The place was dead so it's not like she had other tables to attend to. She kept coming every minute asking what I wanted.   The hot chocolate is powdered and worse than the ones you can get at the grocery stores. The skillet I got was burned and bone dry. Eggs tasted like water.  She was literally hovering over me as I was paying, expecting a tip. Well guess what she didn't get.   Go to another location, they will treat you better with better food."}
{"text":"Good comfort at a fair price.  They even have fit fare menu items for those of us who need to watch our calories  Miro is one of the best servers I have every had the pleasure of interacting with.  He got our special orders correct the first time and was attentive without being overwhelming.   The food was hot and delicious.  The franchise should use this store to train new hires"}
{"text":"Why 2 stars?   1. I hate \"terms of endure net\" like \"honey\" & \"sweetly\" etc. I also don't want to be touched while the server is talking to me.   2. When I ask for no cheese I hate finding cheese in the middle of my food while eating.    3. I don't like waiting 10 minutes for someone to take my drink order     4. My grapes were fuzzy   Not coming back  When I went to check out I couldn't because their system went down"}
{"text":"me and my wife LOVED this place !!!  staff is warm and friendly  - heather - thanks for super service  food was great, even the parking was easy  we ended up eating there every day - 3 nights total  we will def be back again"}
{"text":"Stop for a diner on Thursday night only 1 waiter too take orders, charge people and greet customers. Finally got seated order or food about to start eating when a customer with a service dog was seated next too our booth , dogs starts shaking and all the freaking hair starts flying up in our food and drinks, waiter no where to be found!!! If your authorizing service animals in the restaurant please use common courtesy don't seat them next to other guest eating to avoid hairs in their food like my on Thursday night !!! Went from a great dinner too the worst ever , very disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Food is just what you'd expect from a Denny's,  average. Service was dine. Wait rime was short. Cheaper than most of the restaurants in Vegas, so a welcome drop in price."}
{"text":"This restaurant has had its share of problems. It was boarded up for so long; I finally decided to give it a try once more. Stepping inside took me back, it hadn't changed much from years gone by, I almost turned around expecting to see the old Nevada Palace behind me. After a moment or two I was seated, and a waitress came over to take my drink order. I had hot chocolate with the whipped cream; the whipped cream had all but disappeared by the time it was served. She came to get my order only to discover she had forgotten to give me a menu card. She ran off and retrieved one off another table.  I sat back and talked with the lady at another table who sat down about the same time as me, she was just laid off from Station Casino's coffee shop, at 78 years old was afraid she wasn't going to be able to get another job. We both commented on the poor service and how things are not as they used to be. My food finally came and I pointed out they lady had been seated about as long as I and hadn't been served. I had the bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. It was a new memory in the making; the food was cold, except for the bacon, which dripped of grease. I eat at Denny's, when every my grandson is with me, he just loves the place, just not this place! It wasn't inexpensive, almost $10.00 including a $2.00 tip. I walked out the doors, looking around, I realized it had changed; the sign was the same, the interior the same but that is where it all ended. I won't be back at that Denny's again. East Side Cannery across the street might be a better bet."}
{"text":"Denny's is Denny's no matter where you are.  They are all about the same.  This one is better than most because it's on Fremont Street!  Not only do you get to eat food you already know & love - you get to watch the crazies walk up & down Fremont.  This Denny's also has a cool photobooth that you can take crazy pictures in.    Being in such a touristy place, be prepared to wait a little longer.  It's pretty busy all the time.  The servers are always very nice.  Be nice to them & tip well - you wouldn't want to serve - so don't be an a-hole to your waiters or waitresses."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's, but a little bit amped up to be more suited for Fremont Street. It's clean and rather pristine. It appears to always be mostly empty. (Why would you eat at a Denny's when there's so much other food to be tried and had?) What this place does have, though, is a bar. So if you're looking for a non-crowded place to grab a drink, this is a decent option."}
{"text":"Stopped in and there were only 2 other tables besides us. Food was okay but service was a bit slow. My water tasted awful and I told the waitress about it so she just goes over to the pitcher and drinks right out of it to taste the water. Said it tasted like dirt.  Didn't even take the pitcher in back to clean it and goes to get me a different glass of water.  It is clear she didn't care about hygiene issues. I thought the water tasted like some kind of cleaning chemical was left over in the pitcher from the reckless workers cleaning the dishes.  Eitherway I will be avoiding this place."}
{"text":"No service at all, even on a not very busy time.  Came over with some friends at around 3AM. I was seated right away by a very polite waiter but then, sat for about 15 minutes with no attention at all. Restaurant was busy but by no means it was packed. Waiter ran by us several times but no attention was given at all. Had to give up and go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here around 10 on a Friday night. They were slow and brought our food out at separate times. I was almost done when my sisters came out. She ate half of her $4 chicken wraps when I could see something red under her chips. I moved them to find used chewing gum sitting under her food. When we told the waitress she said \"you guys were chewing gum when you came in weren't you?\". We weren't chewing gum on our way in and to prove to lady it wasn't ours I pulled out my pack of mint gum.  I didn't pay for our two meals that totaled a whopping $8. But I was insulted that she thought I was trying to get out of $8 meal by putting my used chewing gum on her plate."}
{"text":"Feel funny leaving five stars, but the place is clean.  Don't expect the world and leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Slow !!!!!! Allow one hour for pancakes and eggs ! Only 4 tables with customers yet one hour for food. Forgot all our hash browns. We didn't want to wait any longer for them. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Denny's at this location until today.. The coffee cups my wife and myself got were dirty with stains from previous use meaning they were never put trough the dishwasher. When I complain to the manager he just brought us new ones without an apology or a reason. I'm not one to complain but I don't think this behavior is good for business"}
{"text":"I love this location. The neon is really KOOL and the people watching is great from the patio. Where else but here can you see a Texas Sheriff, The Bandit,  a topless nun, a man in a bright yellow speedo and all the people from the bible belt with the best look on their faces all in one place."}
{"text":"Food and service was ok but at the end of the meal waiter brought me back my tip apologizing for the poor service. Guess it wasn't enough for him"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast around 6 or 7am. Okay food for okay prices. I ordered a T-bone steak medium but came well done. Well, considering it's Denny's, I didn't really expect much.  Quality: 6/10. Services: 7/10. Value: 6.5/10. Overall: 6.5/10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast let me see how simple I can make this.. So busy it took a while to order let alone get our food server was polite and apologetic nachos were unappealing and chips were stale, French toast and bacon was good tho but the eggs were cold."}
{"text":"I was debating on writing this but eh why not. Not a bad place for the late late night dinner.  Been there a few times and consistently good even at one, two, or three in the morning.  Kind of hard to mess up breakfast unless the server is busy and doesn't bring out orders quickly and they die in the window.  I haven't run into that here in the early morning hours."}
{"text":"Had the prime rib cobb salad. If you want a light lunch, this is it.  Beef, avocado, and salad with that balsamic v. sauce!  Had a great time! However, felt little expensive."}
{"text":"Cant get service tonite... Pretty sad... Have been here 25 minutes and no one has come to our table.... See ya!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there Saturday morning on our way to Lake Mead so we were looking for something decent that wouldn't take forever. We definitely got what we wanted! The service was actually excellent, very attentive and friendly. The food was about as good as Denny's gets, I liked the eggs and sausage. The bacon didn't have a ton of meat and the pancakes were just a bit dry. Everything's relative! Highly recommended if of course you like Denny's."}
{"text":"located at Neonopolis, third time there, no disappointments,  fun, decent food, and they pour heavy!!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of places like this but it was close to 4am in the morning, and I still had a ton of travelling to do. Yelp searched the closest open food place to my location, at the time, and this location popped up. Dana was super sweet and friendly. In addition, she answered all of my questions and was very professional."}
{"text":"Came in with my husband and I had to listen to all the servers say they didn't want to serve us. Yes we are a gay couple but to be passed up like that I just walked out."}
{"text":"At 9 PM, the kids and I grabbed a bite at Denny's. I had the chicken noodle soup. It was a home style chicken noodle soup and seasoned on the salty side. It suited me perfectly because i was recovering from a cold and could hardly taste anything. My children ate the Strawberries and Cream breakfast. The pancakes were delicious, infused with white chocolate. The bacon was crisp, the hashbrowns were well seasoned. Our meal came up to under $15. Our server, Rohde was always helpful in refilling our glasses of water. I am happy that we have a nice neighborhood Denny's."}
{"text":"Busy, busy, busy!   They have a complimentary valet parking. They work for tips.  We chose to eat at Denny's because it was convenient. We also received a coupon for $5 off if you spend $25 or more.  We arrived at 10 am. It was already crowded but we were seated almost immediately. We asked our server, Myra, if it was this busy all the time. \"This isn't busy! This isn't bad at all. Stick around, and you'll see when it gets busier.\"  Myra was a gem. We couldn't decide what to eat, and she checked on us three times. We finally ordered the chicken fried steak skillet, the fried strawberry pancake puffs, a turkey club sandwich and the nachos.  Our order took a long time. We were hungry and grumpy. Myra did a nice job keeping our water glasses filled. She came out and explained she had a new cook that only spoke Spanish and misunderstood our nacho order. We had asked that the liquid cheese sauce or queso be put on the side. The new cook kept putting the liquid sauce on the nachos and the shredded cheese on the side. Finally, she brought out the ingredients separately, and we did our own assembling. The chicken fried steak skillet was perfect. The fried potatoes were cooked through and the peppers and onions were caramelized well. The turkey club was alright. The strawberry pancake puffs were absolutely genius. Whole strawberries were fried inside the batter and it came with a fabulous powdered sugar dip. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We gobbled everything up.  By the time we left, there was a waiting line. It was even a bigger nightmare outside with parking. The valets could not keep up with the volume. We eventually got our car and got on our way."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what to say about Denny's. It was deadest Denny's I have ever been to. Service seemed fine and the food wasn't bad. I would go back."}
{"text":"I am the first to admit, Denny's is not an instant choice of mine when it's time to grab some grub. I hadn't been to this particular location in about eight years, until a friend wanted some cheap late-night eats last month. And while the meal went well enough, it admittedly had some hiccups.  Service was mediocre, with our waitress coming and going at an inconsistent pace. Sometimes we were checked on often, sometimes we were left waiting for a chance to place an order or to ask for a refill. The place didn't seem particularly busy either, but in fairness, perhaps something else was going on and keeping her busy behind the scenes?  The food was sadly just as \"hot and cold\" as the service. My friend and I split our meals that night: a burger, a side salad, party nachos, and a grilled steak skewer. The burger and skewer were actually pretty good - I would say my skewer was even great, featuring well cooked and seasoned steak, all served on a lovely stack of hot fresh vegetables and crispy potatoes. My friend called her burger \"fine\", so, an average burger it must have been. But as for the salad, I could only enjoy a single bite before turning it over to my friend; it was dripping in dressing. Most disappointing, however, were the nachos, as the chips tasted stale - so stale that their pile of meat and toppings could not make up for it. Something that stake has no place in any kitchen.  Disappointments there may have been, but as I mentioned, the main courses were actually pretty good. I felt that Denny's delivered an a-ok experience overall. Plus, I also got a large, cheap meal out of the deal. Fine dining it is not, but I'd consider returning for a budgeted meal again, now that I know more about what to expect (and avoid). Perhaps next time I can see how a breakfast course compares!"}
{"text":"I am a Denny's lover. Their food is always so tasty and appealing!  This is a pretty new location, couldn't pay with my Denny's app  the server seemed to know nothing about this option, but he was amazing and patient with us. We were served quicly and our breakfast was excellent as usual!"}
{"text":"Stopped in around midnight on a Saturday night after the Carolina Rebellion show. Our waitress was kind of short with us but she was polite. I just think she was in a hurry due to the number of tables she had. That aside, she was very nice, helpful with the menu items and very quick. Everyone at the table (five adults) were happy with the food and the food arrived very quickly. If you are a fan of Denny's this is a really good location."}
{"text":"Talk about dirty dining!! I don't believe I'll be coming back... Food was ridiculously hot when it got to us, couldn't eat it for 10 mins.... Very dirty place. The jelly holder on the table was dirty, floor was disgusting (needs to be cleaned or replaced), the plates our food was served on were chipped and dirty...."}
{"text":"Hold my chicken!!!!! Concord mills is literally the best Denny's ever.  Delightful decor, clean , and an engaged staff.  Management seems to run a tigjt ship and Adam is a very competent manager who leads his team well.  Kudos!   (I previously wrote a colorful review but was told it was not appropriate so I toned it down, which was personally very depressing as I don't believe in censorship but whatever"}
{"text":"Ok, let's keep this in perspective... It's 3am here in Vegas.  Trying to get back on east coast time.   I'm groggy and hungry.  One problem, my options are pretty limited for a hot meal this early in the morning.  So what's the solution?  Denny's!  They were quite busy for 3am on a Saturday.  As soon as I approached the counter, I was seated.  Within 30 seconds of being seated I met Barbara who took very good care of me.  A nice glass of cold tea was on my table within two minutes.  Service was quick, food was hot and tasty... Albeit a bit greasy, but hey... This is Denny's, right?  Not to mention some of the loud, drunk patrons were quite entertaining!  I would highly recommend them if you are staying in this part of Vegas and are looking for a good, hot meal this late at night / early in the morning."}
{"text":"Won't ever be going back. I thought I'd give it a try again after really bad service last time. Went in at about 12:00am there was 3 tables seated (one which had their food already) two waiting to order. Waited 10mins for waiter to come to the table, by that time I was ready to order. I was only able to order my drink when he walked away. By that time a gentleman that was waiting to order walked out. Seemed like he's been waiting for a while. I waited a bit more and then decided to walk out. Seemed like it was going to be a while before I got my food."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Had to return eggs (snotty). Had to return bacon (wimpy and slimy).  Never came back to refill coffee.  Waitress was Sabrina.  I was holding the coffee cup up in the air.  A guy asked if we wanted more coffee.  We said yes, but he never came.  My husband got up and got his own and then another customer followed suit.  My niece was asked 3 times if she wanted more coffee and so far nothing.  Oops it just came.  Said the manager would come over but he didn't.  They took one breakfast off but no manager."}
{"text":"Thought maybe, just maybe the service at a Denny's in a tourist town would be better that at home in Denver.  NOPE!  Still is extremely slow and horrible!"}
{"text":"FUCKING WHACK Dennys dont even fucking know how to fucking serve people I wish i could give 0 stars"}
{"text":"I'm not happy about our visits to Denny's. The whole time we were repeating ourselves and it hurt to ask for anything from our server. The only thing that went right was our drink order. I understand when people are busy and the time can be pushed a little. Our food came out in fine time but wasn't given any thought. Our server kept forgetting simple requested we made. We ended up asking a host who helped us right away. Maybe if our server was more attentive and payed attention to detail our visit would've gone more smooth."}
{"text":"Of the Denny's restaurants in my area, this is my favorite.   I like that it hasn't been remodeled because I like the peaceful, relaxing environment.  I always find the food enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Denny's location... and I have eaten at many Denny's locations. In fact my mom and I have a song called \"Denny's Blues\" that we sing on the way to Denny's. I have a more sophisticated pallet, but sometimes a deluxe chicken salad or Grand Slam at 1AM really hits the spot. With that said I had a delicious 1AM meal at this Denny's a few weeks ago.. and a even yummier milkshake.   Food always seems to come out really fast, which is a major plus since Denny's cooks can either be super busy or lag hardcore!   *Thumbs up*"}
{"text":"We were ignored for quite a long time by the hostess.  When we finally sat down and ordered, my food did not appear to be what I requested.  I asked the waitress about it who was dismissive and rude.  Had to end up calling a manager over to get my order corrected."}
{"text":"We got seated right away on a busy Sunday morning. Service was great and we always got attention from our waiter. Food came quickly and was great. Hard working waiters!"}
{"text":"Wow, I waited for about 15 min before someone even CAME to the counter to seat us. There's also like 10 people after us and we were all waiting. Do not come here- go to OHOP or anywhere else."}
{"text":"Such a traditional american place! Proper had to come somewhere like this on the road trip! We al had the Grand Slam breakfast! Which basically consists of unlimited coffee and any four items from a list. I got pancakes, hash browns, eggs and like a porridge (which wasn't good at all...A scot trying porridge in america is a little silly to be fair!!) But the pancakes were beautiful with all that butter and maple syrup!! very filling and cheap! Set us up for the day!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area to spend time with my daughter and it seems like Denny's is the only chain restaurant in this area, not much to choose from honestly. Our first visit the service was great, the second time my daughter and I had a different waitress who got the order wrong twice. It was so lame and inexcusable- my daughter ordered plain blueberry pancakes and the waitress brings back pancakes loaded with strawberries and whipped cream. So we asked if she could correct it;  again she brings back an order of pancakes loaded with whipped cream and topped with strawberries. She claims that my daughter originally ordered strawberry pancakes which is not true because my daughter is deathly allergic to strawberries and I listened as she ordered, which was plain blueberry pancakes with no topping. So after sending the order back the second time, my daughter said no thank you for another attempt to get the order corrected. Afterwards, the waitress was extremely mean and rude to us because she got the order wrong twice plus she never apologized and argued with my daughter about what she originally ordered.  I should have taken heed to the reviews here on Yelp, what a horrible experience and the wait time was not even worth it."}
{"text":"Denny's are all the same.. same ol menu.. same ol nasty greasy food... but will definitely settle your cravings after a long night of severe drinking in Vegas. This is located conveniently on the strip right next to Harrahs. We had 6 of us and we ordered fairly simple things.. yet our waiter got a lot of things mixed up and messed up. Its okay though he was awesome and put up with our complaints and such.. even gave us to go cups for our sodas.. extra side of hash browns, pancakes and toast. At least we left satisfied.."}
{"text":"A decent place at a decent price. The counter service is not as good because having to serve tables too. Other than that I would recommend it for a quick bite at an affordable price. I usually have an omelet of sorts and they do make it to order. Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"Excellent value with 2/4/6/8 menu.  More importantly, extra friendly hostess, counter, and waitress service despite the crowds.  Pleasantly surprised as the hotels (TI) really take advantage."}
{"text":"Just walked in then immediately turned around and left. This is one of those times that you can definitely judge a book by it's cover. Looks like a dump from the outside and it doesn't disappoint. As a non-smoker, the cigarette odor in the restaurant is sickening. The restaurant entrance is open to the casino and the smell inside Denny's is the same as the Casino. Avoid this place if you're not a chain smoker."}
{"text":"Rude staff...dirty resturant. We didn't stay, we paid for our ice teas and left. Terrible customer service. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Every complaint is the same I have placed on online got there and it still wasn't ready and then waited 20+ minutes. This happened every time. You could order the simplest thing and it's still gonna be an hour wait."}
{"text":"So I'll give them the fact that it's a Sunday morning and they seemed a bit understaffed in the kitchen (including the kitchen staff standing behind the building smoking) and their host was also waiting tables. I'll give them that. HOWEVER, I felt the need to share this experience regardless. It all started on a brisk Sunday morning, about 11:30. We were greeted by an annoyed girl and once she sat us down the first thing she said was \"I hate my job\" so it really set the mood right for this experience. We got our beverages and placed our order. About 45-50 minutes after we got our food (about a half hour of waiting she told us we were up next to get our food, then proceeded taking out 5ish other tables' food before ours finally came). Our food was so greasy and buttery that my eggs tasted like straight butter and my pancakes were not cooked all the way through. And now after eating I get home and feel sick to my stomach.  Overall, food was beyond greasy. Customer service was rough. Sunday date breakfast was ruined and I most likely will not be going to Denny's again."}
{"text":"Don't usually have problems with this Denny's but recently there were 2 hairs in my pancakes.  Yes in the middle of cutting it I pulled them out from the inside. They were nice enough not to charge me and make me new pancakes."}
{"text":"What is going on here? Are they always shortstaffed? They took so long with our meals. Everything we asked for took long. 2nd time we went we left because the line was almost out the door waiting for seats."}
{"text":"Wow! Impressive for a Denny's. Best one I've ever gone too. It's brand new, spotless, modern and retro, the customer service and professionalism was spot on, which is not what I've come to expect at Denny's but admittedly, that's always been part of the fun of going there.   The food was hot, fresh, and tasty and nicely presented. You can get the mix and match soda pop flavors here. My son had a great strawberry shake. The server was happy to accommodate his request of no eggs, extra French toast. And our late night family is happy to have a 24 hour place to eat that's not a bar or in a neighborhood where you might get mugged or worse.    Wish my onion ring portion would have been just a bit larger, not that I need them or anything, but they were really good and I think I only got five."}
{"text":"After leaving Steak & Shake because of not being acknowledged or seated we waited in line at Denny's and hada wonderful breakfast. Great food and service. Such friendly people that work there, they took some time to get us a seat but let us know they where working on it. Simple little things make a difference."}
{"text":"Denny's are a safe and sure value. Can't really go wrong here. We had breakfast here and as expected it was good with a nice service."}
{"text":"I don't typically like chain restaurants, but on a tight road trip schedule, you stop where you can. I was pleasantly surprised. Very clean (enough that I didn't mind my daughter climbing under the table), friendly and prompt staff, and food was regular chain restaurant menu, but good."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food!!! Massively above typical Denny's.   great job management!!!"}
{"text":"My party & I went here for breakfast after an extremely long night on the town. The placed was packed so we had to wait a little bit before we were seated. The waitress that we had was friendly and provided good customer services. It was pretty much the same with the other waiters and waitresses that we talked to in there. Our meal was pretty damn good if you ask me. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Yes, 4 stars for Denny's.  Why?  Because it's damn good for what it is.  Good, quick, cheap food at any time of the day.  If you get sick from food poisoning, find a pube in your meal, or your server snorts coke in front of you by rolling up one of your pancakes, then yeah, give it one or two stars.  But you walked into Denny's knowing what it was, right?  The staff was friendly and efficient.  Almost too efficient - a crowd of people were waiting to be seated as a crowd of people were waiting to pay.  The food came out quickly and it was your typical budget diner fare.  No surprises here.  The prices are among the lowest that you'll find for restaurants on the strip and it'll give you the energy to walk around on a hot day.  Also don't understand some of the reviews where people act like coming here late night / early morning after partying is a bad thing.  I think it's a great thing.  Denny's is a good way to recharge after a night out.  There's no shame in that.  Unless you're a girl with four guys, walking around like you're a cowboy.  Then there's a little shame in that.  But it's Denny's - nobody will judge you."}
{"text":"The new Chopped Kale and Grilled Chicken Salad is absolutely amazing. I am hooked now.   The server was very attentive. The restaurant is clean and the staff are all friendly. This Denny's is a great location! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Yuuuuck. I never expect much when I go to iHop or Denny's, but this place was terrible! If you're going to pay almost $30 for a diner breakfast, you'd at least expect decent food and service!   Our server's name was Mary and the host raved about her at every opportunity he got, which just came across as creepy and annoying after the third comment was made. There were crumbs all over the table, and everything just felt so sticky!   I had some waffle plate and my husband got some type of omelette. Everything was cold and Mary finally decided to give me a refill and ask us how our food was 10 minutes after we were done eating - it sucked, Mary!   Do yourself and any other folks you plan on taking out for breakfast a favor and splurge a little bit by spending an extra few bucks a couple of streets down in old town where you'll get tasty food and decent service."}
{"text":"This should actually be rated a negative 5, due to the filthiness of the place. The restaurant was slow, with very few people in there. There were lots of staff working, or whatever you'd  call they were doing. There was food all over the floor, throughout the restaurant. Table was sticky, and seat was dirty. The hostess looked like an extra (zombie) from The Walking Dead. She had this unpleasant stare, blank expression, and walked slower than molasses to seat the customers. It appeared that she was being bothered when a customer walked up to the counter. An employee named Flavio stood in the middle of the restaurant counting a wad of money. After counting it, he handed a portion to the hostess, then walked to a back table and spread the rest of the money out onto the table, got on his cell phone, and sat back and talked for a while. The entire time I was there, he never lifted a finger to help out. The on duty manager was the only person serving the tables, and trying to be upbeat. This place has serious leadership issues. The food was decent, but not enough to ever come back."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes before Travis (our waiter) came to our table all frazzled, and asked if we were ready to order. Before I could give him my order, he put his pointer finger up, and walked away from the table. He never came back, but continued to help all the other tables around us. When I was able to catch him, I ask if he were going to be our waiter, he said he was, but he was too busy, then walked away again. Ten minutes later, Tammy came to our table, took our order, and continued to give us great customer service.  Thank you Tammy  The French toast was good, scrambled eggs undercooked, 2 pieces of bacon not thoroughly cooked, and the other 2 pieces of bacon burnt."}
{"text":"This is a Denny's, so the food is pretty unremarkable. However, when I've had to forego Matt's Big Breakfast and Mel's Diner for whatever reason, I come here because the food is consistently decent and the staff is consistently friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner, starving during our relocation from Oregon to Texas.  We advised our Dog doesn't have a service vest by that she does perform tasks and is almost certified. Dueto the heat, if we left her in the car she would die.  Haley was incredibly kind- notifying the other staff that there was a working service dog and that they should offer her a bowl of water to prove good customer service.  We were so appreciative- most places we've encountered (restaurants, hotels, parks, and other public places) are quick to turn their nose up thinking that Trina (previous grand champion show dog turned medical alert dog) is just an emotional needs dog. Trina still needs to be able to eliminate on command in order to pass her service test.  Haley even gave us some tips on overcoming this task. Haley went above and beyond-she deserves 5 stars for her excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"So...I recently took a trip to Vegas with a friend and met down with a large group for the weekend. I had been to Vegas before and have had what I'd consider the best Monte Cristo sammich ever. On this trip I made it a point to have another Monte Cristo. Fast forward to the end of my trip. It's 2am and I'm about to leave in about 3 hours. I quickly get on Yelp, only to find that all the places I'm searching for close at a reasonable hour in the day. My friends suggested we go to this Denny's and try our luck. At first I was hesitant, but it's 2am on a weekend in Vegas. Heavy amounts of alcohol may have been involved. We show up and I pick something off the menu only to ask for a million substitutions on the sammich to try to get what I want. The waitress (Jessica) looks a little puzzled, but then begins to understand what I'm after. She checks with the cook, and confirms they can do this for me. Kudos to this wonderful staff who so nicely accommodated a couple of drunks even when super busy. The icing on the Monte Cristo cake was when Jessica then brought out an assortment of jam, maple syrup, and a bowl of powdered sugar.   If I could give this fine establishment 25 billion stars, I would. I'll definitely be back.  -Danny."}
{"text":"Steak and eggs at anytime of the day is a dream come true especially when you get it from Denny's. I must say my T-bone steak was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing just the way I like. My eggs on the other hand they weren't they I ordered them but no fuss. Their home fires are the bomb.  The staff at this location are phenomenal very friendly and  I will definitely come back for my steak breakfast again.   Clean dinner was very impressed with that."}
{"text":"The men's room is a hell hole. I can't believe they're even open with it looking like this. Does corporate know? The urinal is broken and the one stall is missing the door. Someone has hung a curtain instead. No towels at one sink.  It really makes me wonder...if the bathroom is this bad then do they care about the food?  Oh...and the waffle iron is busted. You know people eat breakfast here, right?"}
{"text":"We always end up going to this Dennys because of one waitress Joanna Antillon is awesome and always is happy and the reason we keep coming back.  Highly recommend going to this location and asking for Joanna!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday,  steady business but we were still sat fairly quickly. Our waiter/server was nice but seemed pretty distracted and scatter brained. I think she was trying to keep up with all the tables she was assigned so Refills and such took longer than we would've liked.  I understand what it's like when they're busy but another waiter asked her if she needed help and she declined.  So I'm not sure how to feel about it.   On a separate note, the food was delicious and hot.  Only issue we had was our strawberry lemonade, tasted like water."}
{"text":"I live closer to Black Bear dinner but the great staff at this Denny's always keeps me coming back here. This last night I was here has by far been one of the best times. Was greeted and promptly seated by the only host/server Tyler who even tho he had a pretty full section attended our ever need in addition to his other tables. My boyfriend and I have been in the restaurant industry so we know the pressure of it all and we can tell this guy was on his A game. Now let me add that the night crew in the kitchen did a fantastic job as well. We love having breakfast for late night dinners and the food was cooked exactly the way we love it. Perfect hash browns, bacon, eggs and french toast. Thank you Tyler and kitchen crew for the satisfying meal and service!"}
{"text":"Thought to stop by since it's newer to the area. Worst service every almost an hour wait for a salad and skillet. Manager older lady had no direction it was chaotic. No one greeted guest as they came in they were more focused on busing tables. Over hear a couple ask for a specific dessert and hear the manager yell in back the come out and try to get them to get a banana split instead because the other one was a hot desert. Sad addition to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"This location excels in the following areas -Clean Dining Room  -Very Nice Servers -The Food is what we have come to expect."}
{"text":"The food is great... the service especially the speed of service is consistently horrible. On the occasions that I have been in it takes an hour or more to get food. Restaurant is horribly understaffed as there is typically one stressed out server in the dining room at peak times."}
{"text":"We never got to eat because we sat down and no one acknowledged us. So after 15 minutes we got up to leave. Stopped at the cashier where the manager was and still wasn't acknowledged. Walked out, never walking back in"}
{"text":"Normally I'd never choose Denny's, but we were on a ten-hour drive and hungry, and it was right there off the highway. Slooooooow service, which really was exactly the opposite of what I was looking for. I mean seriously slow, and there was hardly anyone in the place, and the items we ordered were not something that needed time to make -- I had a burger, my travelling companion a plate of spaghetti."}
{"text":"Lore the Manager was awesome. She came by to greet us and made sure that we had everything that we needed. The restaurant is located next to Outlets and it looks newly remolded. Certainly not the old Denny's I remember when I worked at one nearly 25 years ago."}
{"text":"We go to this Dennys each and every year that we go to Vegas. This year it wasn't any different. We really enjoy coming here, though the wait can sometimes be a bit much. It's a typical Denny's, with some basic stores such as Ross nearby."}
{"text":"Currently Here! The food taste pretty good except for my potatoes that were cold, like to the touch cold. The staff is awful. Our waitress (Vanessa T) waited on people that came in after us before she even got our drinks to us. People that came in after us received their food before our order was taken. When she came to finally take our order she began to complain about the other guest that she was helping saying they were being difficult and had too hard of an order. My food sat on the counter to get cold while our waitress tended to other guest and it came out one dish at time. I got my main dish, then about 5 minutes later my company got their dish, then my bread was brought out. I originally ordered rice with my food but the waitress asked me do we even have rice. I smiled and said well it's on the menu. She said do you want something else I ain't never seen nobody order that before. I ordered something different, but the level of unprofessionalism all the way around was enough to insure I don't return. I felt as if my group was neglected due to our race and I feel we were discriminated against because of the color of our skin. We were not considered a priority or respected as paying customers. When we got up to pay I noticed the sanitation score was 94. Considering the rest of my experience at this Denny's I can only assume they put as much effort into their cleanliness as they do their customer service, which isn't much at all!"}
{"text":"It was just okay.  Tables were dirty ... looked at tables around us and they were all dirty.  I scraped off the cream cheese mix off my part of the table.  Kinda gross.   Had to wait until we got our bill to get the kids cup my son wanted - which by the way we ordered when we ordered our food.  Husband got steak and eggs (steak over cooked), I got the philly cheese steak omlet (lets put it this way the cheese didnt melt) it was luke warm, kids breakfest was as expected.  Waitress was slow."}
{"text":"Really good service. We sat at counter. Waitress was fast and nice. Off the strip at Vegas"}
{"text":"I came in with my mother yesterday morning for breakfast. We both ordered the Grand Slam with different items. I ordered mine with Pancakes, Hashbrowns, Sausage Links and Bacon. I took a bite of the hashbrowns and they were cold and undercooked. I sent them back and asked the waitress to just bring me fruit because I didn't want them to just be reheated. I then placed the butter that comes with the pancakes on and between the pancakes and it never melted. The pancakes were cold and had clearly been previously cooked and sitting out. I was  very disappointed with the meal and when I told the cashier, she just said, \"Oh, Sorry\". When I asked to speak to the manager, the cashier told me that he was cooking and I would have to wait. When I looked in the kitchen, He Was There, being the cool. The only bright spot in the whole ordeal, was the Cashier. She was really accommodating and she always came back to check on us with a smile."}
{"text":"Being new to the area, me and my wife had nothing much to do on Christmas so we decided to go eat at this Denny's. As i arrived I noticed a few employees not too happy about having to work on Christmas which is totally understand however our server Vince was the complete opposite.  He is the reason I am giving this place 5 stars. Even though there was so many people to attend to he made sure everyone was well taken care of. Had a very positive attitude and was super friendly.  I would definitely return and recommend anyone here just because of him. Thank you for you're excellent customer service and positive attitude vince!"}
{"text":"Traveling for business... Great service, prompt to the table. Server recommended the Crazy Spicy Skillet and it was awesome! The restaurant was clean, and the manager came by to ask if everything was okay. I'd come back."}
{"text":"If I could I would honestly give this place no stars. However ones reasonable for the people that work the grave yard shifts they're not like the morning-day. Me & some family went and we went in at 11 am & its 12:10 pm and our food was still not out. The waiter was rude, didn't keep us updated, spilled water on the table and on my phone didn't clean it said he was going to go get something to wipe it but never did. When my sister in law asked how long it would take after he previously came by once and said just a few more minutes he than said when she asked they didn't even start yet because there's only 2 cooks and caught an attitude. People who came after us got their food before us & that's ridiculous. Went to Canes instead."}
{"text":"11:30 pm on a Sunday nite, after TRYING to get service at Tilted Kilt, I kept walking up the strip and found the new Denny's on the second floor next to Casino Royale.  Greeted at the door as soon as I walked in, sat, and given menu, all in under a minute.  Michelle was an excellent waitress, attentive and polite. She moved with a purpose, and it showed.  Food came out quickly, a sandwich and fries w pop/ coffee.  She checked on me several times, and was really sweet.  Got a nice hot coffee to top off the meal.  Standard Denny's quality chow, but service makes the difference."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and my daughter wanted to play the game in the front of the restaurant where you try to grab stuffed animals. She dropped 4 quarters in the machine, which asked for $1.00 per play. After putting in 4 quarters the game didn't register. When she told the cashier about it she replied that they don't have anything to do with the games. That's it. No recommendation or suggested course of action.  My point of this review is if an establishment is going to sponsor a game inside of their place of business then their staff should be trained on how to take care of customer concerns. At least let the customer know what they can do about it instead of saying, \"We don't have anything to do with the games.\""}
{"text":"Nothing quite like comfort food.   This Denny's is always clean and comfortable. The food is consistent and the service is always amazing.   They run our of apple crisp a lot but if they have it order it and enjoy.   Additionally the revamp of the interior is beautiful."}
{"text":"Food is Good. Service is HORRIBLE! You could literally walk out & not pay they sit around talking ignore you if you need something. Forget about refills or condiments or even a smile or positive vibe. Rude snide attitudes. So sad."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast with my sis before heading out, I got there a little late and had our waitress (Tera) put my order in a little later, and she still managed to get my food out at the same time everyone else's arrived. Excellent service, checked up on us regularly & filled our beverages exquisitely on time considering how busy it was.  This particular Denny's, however is located inside a casino. It reeks of cigarettes upon entering, I don't recommend for those with a sensitive sense of smell, children or pregnant women. On the upside, there's extra bathrooms in the casino right next to the Denny's which only has one unisex bathroom located inside."}
{"text":"Usually Denny's is safe if all you want is cheap/easy/quick diner food. It's hard to screw up most breakfast items. They also have a \"wait time\" placard on the front door, but didn't mark it with the actual wait time. We went in thinking there was no wait time, to find out there was a 15minute wait (which at least wasn't too long).   So it's disappointing when \"over easy\" eggs come out cooked all the way through. The French toast was alright, but not great.   Probably wouldn't go to this location again."}
{"text":"My family and I went there on a weekday around 14:30 hours, no one was at the counter to seat us.  We had to sit ourselves down.  Saw a waitress asked her for menus just gave us attitude. Our waitress was nice but not too attentive. I wrote a complaint to corporate and they email me back apologizing for the bad experience and they will forward my complaint to the restaurant....so, we'll see what happens...."}
{"text":"This is definitely the nicest Denny's I've ever visited.  There is a little area where you can relax and order coffee.  It's really clean and most of the staff are extremely nice.   I ordered the veggie omelette and he had biscuits and gravy.  The food was okay and the server was great.  The checkout line was moving a little slow due to one of the teenage cashiers checking guests out at a zombie like pace( I've never understood why people come to work with horrible attitudes... just quit! We didn't get a 'hello' or a 'thank you'.)  Luckily,  the manager stepped up and opened another register."}
{"text":"This review comes on the heels of a terrible review of the Denny's on Watson Rd. Buckeye a few months ago.  My visit here was on Thu. the 13th of Nov.  Essentially I came here wanting to believe that a different Denny's just couldn't be as bad as the one on Watson Rd.  My hostess/waitress, did not so much as look at me as she was still talking with her friends (in another language) in a nearby booth.  She grabbed a menu and walked to a booth still never having acknowledged, looked at, or spoken to me, which might be good since I don't speak the language they were using.  When I did not follow (I genuinely thought she was doing something besides seating me, so detached was her manner) only when she had reached my assigned booth did she, at last, look at me and motion for me to come and sit down.  I ordered and received orange juice and said that i needed a minute to decide.  Upon which she parked herself in the booth with her friends and happily chatted away long after I was ready to order.  I became a little angry by now, I have seldom (as in NEVER) observed such arrogantly detached treatment of a paying customer.  Normally I have scruples about such things as walking out without settling up.  In this case I had no compunctions what so ever.  This establishment put the final wooden spike in Denny's where I am concerned, not only does their food stink, the service at this establishment surpassed all other experiences I have ever had for arrogance and \"I could care less\" manner.  I realize that diversity is all the rage these days, but it is extraordinarily disenfranchising to be subjected to the detached attention of someone talking in a foreign language while being in an official capacity to serve you.  Tips are not a given, but instead are earned most generously by those who demonstrate a genuine willingness to serve and make a paying customer happy.  Terrible service/terrible food, this can only equate to Dennys' final death rattle.  I went to the Good Egg instead, and darn glad that I did!"}
{"text":"Very poor service! Waited 20mins just for a spoon to stir of coffee even begged for a straw. After 30 mins without food we checked out. The hostess told us to have a nice day!! No apology nothing just see ya"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. My friend and I wanted to grab brunch here and we thought it was a good place. As soon as walked in I knew we had made the wrong choice! Oh Server HOLLEE P. didn't even greet us she had a really bad attitude and the service was not as great as it normally is. Inclusively  she kept marks while she was ringing us up when we were paying. My friend and I both had a coupon and still gave us issues with it. Saying they normally don't accept coupons. But we signed up for email coupons??? This was the worst experience ever! She didn't even refill out waters until we left and we're done with our food. HOLLEE P. WAS HORRIBLE. If u go make sure you don't get her. She didn't even say thank you or anything. She sure didn't get a tip from us."}
{"text":"After driving around for awhile, me and the fam decided to go to Dennys. There are menu items that we always order that we like such as the cheese fries and buffalo strips. But this is the first time we had actually been to this Denny's. First we had a 70 year old waitress who was slow as hell, she was acting like she really didn't want to be there, and at her age she probably shouldn't have been. She rarely smiled and I don't know if the food took forever or if she was just slow getting it. The people who worked there were conversing like they didn't have anything better to do. My husband called a waitress like 5 times before she even realized (she was daydreaming). As far as the food, don't even bother...stuff that we had before did not taste the same and it was under seasoned. Except for my daughter's buffalo chicken sandwich that was 2 salty, and barely had buffalo sauce on it. Also when we asked for ranch she gave blue cheese, then we realized that the ranch and blue cheese had been mixed together resulting in a weird blended taste. So basically save your money or go to a different Denny's because this one sucks ass."}
{"text":"They've just finished a major refurbishment.  Looks pretty good.  The food is typical Denny's, the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"I was amazed by the burger!  What a good discovery.  I should not tell you and keep for myself ;)  Onion rings really good.  But beware if tey try to underserve you 6rings. Ask for more. I dint know if it was an jonest mistake quicly corrected or my divine intervention.  Good staff (when I was there, of course...it's restaurant business!)"}
{"text":"Food was horrible, service was horrible!! This Denny's sucks, period. We arrived around 12 AM there was not one person in there besides my family. We ordered 4 different plates. Took about 30-35 mins . Once the food arrived, we were served COLD, UNCOOKED sausages, we asked for sunny side up egg & the cook had no idea what kind sunny side up eggs were. Literally look like he just threw the egg on the plate, looked like a blob of spit. I told the waitress IRENE that I wasn't happy with the sausages or eggs and if i could have those items taken off the bill, she said she couldn't  because she needed a manager & there was no manger until tomorrow morning . Then she offered us to get a shake or ice cream . We kept saying no . But she kept offering . Once she made the shake she kept starring at us once she served them and made us feel very very very uncomfortable . I am very disappointed in this Denny's!! This makes me never want to go to Denny's again ."}
{"text":"They did not care about their work I saw a worker drop a plate that ice the ice fell on  a table he did not pick it up. The burger was ok but the salad was good."}
{"text":"This review is kind of a mixed bag. Upon entering there were plenty of open (and non-reserved) tables but the staff was fixated on seating everyone in booths, half of which needed bussing. My request to have my disabled mother-in-law seated at a table fell on deaf ears and it was 8 minutes before we were finally seated in a restaurant that wasn't even half full.  Our waitress was top-drawer and the food very good - when it finally came. It was 40 minutes from ordering to delivery.  I think my next Denny's experience will be the one on Grand Ave."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this location the staff are always polite and attentive. I was happy to see that this location brought back the bone in hot wings! My favorite on the menu."}
{"text":"Wow, where to start, typical breakfast crowd on a Thursday morning. Ordered a  coffee and breakfast slam, rye toast and well done hashbrowns. After 30 minutes the manager came by and told me the kitchen is behind and I can get a complimentary salad?!?? I ordered breakfast I don't want a salad. 15 minutes later I  received my meal, hash browns were barely crisp and toast didn't have butter. Upon waiting 10+ minutes for my waitress to bring me another coffee and butter for my toast, not only did my eggs get cold but so did my toast. If I wanted to pay $2.50 for a coffee I would of went to Starbucks. Very disappointed, better off going to ihop 2 miles down the road."}
{"text":"Put our name down at 11.05 am for 9 people. Was quoted 25-30 minutes. After 35 minutes we checked back and saw that many five, four and seven seat tables were being seated that came way after us. Since we saw that there were still large parties of nine ahead of us and that we were now past the estimated time. We said we would like to split our table however needed in order for us to get a table as soon as possible. 6 and 3 or five and four were fine. After another 25 minutes of them ignoring us and not seating us we kept reminding her that it is now an hour and we are waiting. We would like to split our table.  They said a table for nine came available and proceeded to seat us. There were two six seater tables next to each other and I had assumed that they were going to seat nine of us between the two tables. Nope, they seated nine of us on a six seater. . Besides not being able to sit comfortably while we were all squished in, we were then asked for our drink order 15-20 minutes later. We had no waiter for 15 minutes and when we asked any waiter for help they would rudely reply, you are not my table.  When our waiter finally arrived we placed our order.  We ordered hot chocolates. All of them were watery and needed to be remade. (I know what Denny's hot chocolates normally taste like... this was actually the reason we came in.)  The veggie omelette had bacon in it.  Men's bathroom was really dirty. Waiters given too many tables.   Terrible. By putting nine people on a six seater table you are setting them up for a miserable meal. We each bumped elbows a lot... one had to sit forward and one behind so that we all actually fit.  Do not waste your time eating here if you have a large party."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a high rating because they earned it. The food is great, the wait staff is fantastic, the overall atmosphere is wonderful. I tried their hamburgers and honestly instead of going to Max & Erma's we het our burgers at Denny's. We visit Denny's about 3 times a week and never have we had a bad meal.they accept AARP with a 15% discount on the entire bill."}
{"text":"I work close to here so lunch at Denny's isn't sooo bad after all; service is unpredictable and food is unpredictable for some parts as well but this particular post goes to the massive Prime Roast Cobb Salad that I altered for some reason with chicken strips instead. . The portion was stellar, the salad itself was super fresh, the chicken strips were more than plentiful for lunch. .  so I can't say if it's always like this but for the time being Denny's get an awesome 4 Star's for a salad welll done. . Huge Fresh and Yummy. . Paired with some hot sauce & plum sauce for the chicken strips.... you won't have time to talk to anyone lol"}
{"text":"Came with a group of 4 on a Sunday night, and it was pretty packed. However, the service was superb. I ordered the Honey Bacon Jalapeno burger and it was absolutely delicious. I devoured it in 5 minutes. My friends loved their meals as well. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I will no longer be going to this location, my to go orders always seem to get messed up!! The food is sloppy, the people that work there take forever to assist you. I gone here a couple of time giving it another try, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.. save your money and u will not have any disappointments."}
{"text":"15 min wait if that. Busy and noisy but clean. Very friendly and attentive staff. Brenda waited on us and was sweet and made sure to take care of us. Manager walking around greeting people. Will be back:)"}
{"text":"My group of 7 of went into the restaurant and Corinne pulled together a couple tables and took good care of us.   Thanks to Corinne from all of us:) Corrine is an EXCELLANT server."}
{"text":"Waited over a hour for to go food which they said would be ready in 15 mins. Food was wrong. And Manager instead of taking responsibility blames a 16 year old. Probably the worst experience I have had at a Denny's in my life. Will rat manager I have had to deal with. Enter at own risk."}
{"text":"Lupita and tawny are excellent servers . Make sure you ask for them during the weekends. The gm joe wood has invaluable employees in those two"}
{"text":"I love my eggs hot!.. and normally I don't have any complain when i go to Denny's , but today I ordered over medium cook eggs  and I was served over easy...  who likes salmonella???..I don't like it like that,  plus my Bacon was cold...  I ordered a cup of fruit to stated  and they served at the end!!!... so disappointed! although... The waitress was polite!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible they were slow and didn't really come by to ask how we were doing and it took a while to get a seat even though the workers were watching us stand there in the front. They did this to about every customer that came in. The food wasn't cooked how we ordered and it just lacked flavor for french toast. Definitely not going back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Somehow, I always get roped into having lunch at this place whenever we're in town for an event at the Metrolina.  The grilled cheese sandwich was quite possibly the worst I have ever attempted to ingest.  The processed cheese had a very imitation, synthetic taste.  If you're gong to serve me prefabricated, plastic cheese, at least have the good sense to try and hide the evidence by sufficiently melting the stuff.  I asked for wheat bread but it came out on white bread (not that it would have made any difference as far as palatability is concerned).  The Caesar salad would have been fairly edible if it had not been oversaturated with cheap dressing.  If I am coerced into returning, I'm bringing my own food."}
{"text":"Food was just food it seems like Dennys has gone downhill and I have been very disappointed with Denny's. Corporate has no idea what the public wants. Since the menu change everything seems to be a disappointment. The server was ok but seem to be more interested in cleaning and bussing tables instead of finishing  working with my table."}
{"text":"I dunno. Call me weird, but I love the older feel of this Denny's and there is this one male server who is there most weekends that is just AWESOME. Cozy feel, but always busy, so plan on waiting a little for a seat. :)"}
{"text":"Three things make this the best Denny's in Las Vegas: the hard working staff, the consistent quality and speedy food, and their bowl of grits.  The staff (Daniel & co.) at times may seem overwhelmed, but they really come through and always with a positive attitude.   Great way to start your morning.  I've never had a bad meal here.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Most people wouldn't expect to rate Denny's 5 stars but my visit here for breakfast warrants the high rating. The service here is outstanding. Everyone was super friendly and attentive including the manager who seated me in the back room away from all the noise. But the person who made this visit one I will remember for a long time was my server, Crystal. She was the best server I've experienced in years, even after going to some expensive restaurants. Crystal made sure my coffee was filled/warmed and just so attentive. She was really friendly, smiled lots, and just gave a good vibe. When dining alone, I sometimes feel a bit out of place but with the constant attention from her, I felt warm and welcomed. Even though my eggs weren't all cooked, she made sure to tell the cook and asked me if i wanted replacement eggs or anything else. Crystal was very busy with other tables that had larger groups but never once forgot about me. Seriously this girl deserves every penny she earns and then some. She takes top place for service. If I'm ever back in Phoenix, I would go out of my way to go here again just to sit in her section.  Oh and the pumpkin pancakes were amazing!"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow. The staff is nice but they are just slow. Decided to come in for breakfast over Cracker Barrel and it was a mistake. The food was eh as well so it didn't make it that much better"}
{"text":"So basically reading through some of the reviews posted I don't see too much criticism about the food so I am going to add my two cents.   We came for an early breakfast 5am. I wasn't expecting too much from the service staff at that hour, but surprisingly the waitress was friendly and did a very good job.   I ordered the \"make your own slam\" and was very disappointed. I ordered it with 2 sunny side eggs, hashbrowns, toast, and turkey bacon. The eggs were not cooked properly, had some gelatinous spots in the center. The hashbrowns were not seasoned, and the turkey bacon was not crispy at all. With that said my biggest concern was the coffee. It was very odd tasting, it tasted like unfiltered tap water. It's a bad sign to me when even the coffee doesn't taste up to par.  I wouldn't recommend coming here until they fix the issues with the coffee and get the chef a bit more training in how to properly cook an egg."}
{"text":"Love the remodel. This is hands down the best Denny's in the valley. The food was really good lady night. The marinara sauce was yummy and I generally dislike Red sauces. Oh and did I mention the remodel? Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Took over one hour to receive our food.  Server seemed nice however he was so baffled as to why the wait was so long it only made us more anxious.  Poor kid he tried hard :(  The food arrived one hour and thirty mins after we ordered, it was wrong but there was no way I was about to say anything, I was just happy to have food.  All the tables around me were as upset as we were.  It was one of the more uncomfortable feelings I have ever had in a restaurant.  I paid my whole tab and never complained like ALL the other tables.  So my wife tells me it was the worst $65 we ever spent.  Which to me was just the cost to get the heck out of there."}
{"text":"I've only visited this location once. And honestly, never again! I'm only being nice and giving them 2 stars cuz the decorations were nice. HOWEVER! My dine-in experience was terrible. My party and I came in at 12:45...it was fairly busy but it took no more than 3 minutes to sit us down. Our waitress was nice, but it took about 15 minutes before she came to us for drinks. Another 5 to come back and take our orders. (3 to 5 minutes is usually the typical wait after you order your drinks and you can't decide what you want to eat...) We got our order in.. no big deal, however my boyfriend started to time how long it took for the gentleman sitting a booth a cross us to get serviced. This gentleman came in and was seated maybe 10 minutes after we put our orders in for drinks. Workers passed him and his table probably about 6 to 7 times. Our waitress glanced at our table and noticed 1 of the ppl at my table needed more drinks... she asked a colleague to refill us. I still had a full glass of soda, and I really didn't need a refill, yet here I get another glass and my friend gets his refill... but the gentleman across us HAS YET TO BE SERVED!!! Literally 35 minutes in, my boyfriend gets fed up and approached the night shift manager at the registers saying that the man who was sitting in the booth across from us was 100% completely ignored, no one came to at the very least take his drink order. Right away he stepped away from the register to take the man's order. We told them that we'd pay for his tab... in the mean time we were still waiting on our food.  About 45 minutes later we finally got our food. The waitress drops off our meals and she went back to the gentleman in the booth across us to take his order. My boyfriend went over there and told the man that we would pay for his tab, just order whatever he wanted. And he did... no big deal to us... but the fact that he sat there forever and no one acknowledged his existence after being seated was outrageous. But he sat patiently... not making a scene, didn't talk shit or anything! We noticed every one else in the restaurant got served so much quicker and was in and out before we even got through our meal. The service here is awful. Most end up staying at a restaurant like this for a couple hrs cuz they get caught up in conversations, we however, stayed so long (2 and a half hrs) because we waited on our food to actually come to us. It's the holiday season and we understand it gets busy but these people need to pay attention to who they are serving, what areas of the restaurant they are responsible for and making sure their customers are being taken care of in a timely manner. The food was cold and bland but it matched their customer service perfectly. I will never come back to this place ever."}
{"text":"Looks like it was recently remodeled. I ordered the grand slams $8.00 and the waitress was nice enough to tell me about the $3.99 grand slam specials. Saved me money. Food was fresh and good. Fluffy pancakes and eggs. So good that I went back a second time. Waitresses were nice also. I had good experience both times 8/23 and 8/24."}
{"text":"Update: the server's name is \"Leah\". She's a horrible employee still and a terrible human being. My friends from out of town wanted to eat there last night and I reluctantly did so. However, I gave it a shot. Mind you when I picked up my order, another server gave it to me. I specifically asked for certain condiments in my bag. Once arriving to bingo, NONE were in my bag. I sent my mother to retrieve them as I was too angry and irritated to do so myself, after about 20 minute she finally returned and said they claimed they out the condiments in the bag. Smh, no - you did not -    Fast forward to Saturday night and we are seated - by miss attitude, with attitude near the kitchen. NOW if you're going to talk about a customer to the rest of the staff about a customer, do not seat the customer near the kitchen - moron. Once the waitress came out after about a 15 minute wait time, she proceeded to argue with my friend about how she put the condiments in the bag and how they must have been lost on the way to bingo - finally she was told that she was wrong and that she wasn't even speaking to the right person. All while having an attitude herself toward my friend who's never been there before and she wanted to argue. Finally we told her we needed more time to decide and what we decided to do was leave once we heard the waitress walk back to kitchen and say something to her friend Leah and they bot started screaming and laughing and HOOTIN AND HOLLERIN like morons.   When the waitress came out, I expressed my distaste in her attitude and treatment and said we would take our business elsewhere. She graciously gave me her name, Leah's name (FINALLY) and the managers name and I made it clear I would be making a formal complaint today in which I did.   Stephanie was an amazing help and I look forward to hearing from Jennifer the general manager when she reads my report. I am disgusted by this ignorant and ridiculous behavior. When someone who is an EMPLOYEE of a restaurant puts their hand in your face and exclaims \"ain't no one got time for yo ass\" that's plain rude and excuse me but ghetto - however there's no shocker there with her.    I've had it with her attitude and disrespect and I sure hope she's got a back up in place being that if her job is still there when the manager gets wind of this, I guess corporate is my next move. I'm far from done with this and people need to learn how to respect others.   Especially if you're an employee of an establishment. If this child still has a job after this, then I would not send my worse enemy to this restaurant ... Not even if someone paid me to."}
{"text":"Upon entering the Denny's on Broadway you can't help but feel the surge of energy from the disgruntled staff and uncomfortable , unsatisfied customers. We started off ordering a round of menus that the staff neglected to provide, we definitely recommend making that your first order, it was very helpful.   Our waitress Erica greeted us with a look in her eyes that says \"I hate my life\" and continued to impress us with no social interactions and an incredible amount of sass towards her fellow employees. You could tell almost instantly that the chemistry between all of the employees was simply electric. When ordering the zesty nachos, which were just as delicious as they were soggy, the waitress questioned us about actually getting them which made us believe that the cheese for the nachos was left out overnight. The taste didn't argue with that theory.   The level of professionalism throughout the staff was sterling. With our waitress/es rotating like the back end of the Phillies bullpen in a losing effort and the easy mistake of forgetting silverware made it hard not to feel like home.   When we finally got our food we were amazed by the mediocrity of it. Everyone felt special as their meals came out individually and cold or warm from the gourmet heat lamp. Our tastebuds exploded when we found our toast came pre-buttered and our burgers were dryer than the Arizona heat.   Simply an unforgettable experience, in a word: lackluster.    Oh but the milkshakes were bomb, 5 stars for dayzzz!"}
{"text":"Went here a few nights ago and it was just awful. I don't expect much from Denny's to begin with but this visit was a joke. The tables were sticky and the windows hadn't been cleaned in years probably. My water came in a cup that was chipped all around the edges. The waitress came to take our order and we said we weren't ready yet and she groaned and mumbled about how she rushed over to our table but we're not even ready yet. There was only one other table in the whole restaurant so it's not like she had a lot to do. She was probably mad she had to put down her phone for two minutes. We got good service compared to the table next to us though. They said they got their about twenty minutes before us and we got out food before they even got to order because their waiter never showed up. When we were leaving all the waitresses were standing by the drink station doing their hair and using their phones. That's pretty unsanitary. There was a lot they could be doing especially when there were table all over with old plates of food that were there before we even got there and had not been cleaned up yet. Just horrible service all around.  The food was a joke too. I got the nachos and you can tell it was all out of a can which I don't expect much more from this kind of a place but they could try a little harder. The meat was cold and there was hardly any cheese. It had a weird taste to it. The onions tastes pretty rotten too. I felt sick by the time I got to the car. I spent the rest of the night and next two days pretty sick as well.   We went to pay our bill ( which we should've complained and got our food for free like the couple before us) but we stood there for a good 4-5 minutes while all the waiters just stood there talking to each other. I wanted to just leave the bill on the counter and walk out since the waiters didn't seem to care about collecting money, but my boyfriend wanted to just pay. This place never used to be this bad."}
{"text":"Denny's is a place you just end up at after a fun night with a group of friends @ midnight. Thankfully we were just as hungry!!  The waiter was super funny and sweet, didn't have any issues and we were pretty loud. The manger even came by and started cracking jokes and singing songs. I loved it. The only downside was who ever was the cook was pretty bad at making our orders correctly. Twice mistake on the same burger and gave us a couple of wrong side orders but no matter what the waitress went back there and corrected it.  It's pretty chill at night with a bunch of teenagers just wanting to hangout beside at home Totally worth the money!!!"}
{"text":"This is the nicest Denny's I've ever been in.  Very family and classic retro feel to it. We wanted to stay close to home and have a quick late lunch. The first thing we noticed was our waitress was a little preoccupied.  My husband's hamburger and my tilapia&veggie plate was delicious!! His cheeseburger was huge and his fries were all as delicious as they looked ! My tilapia was light and flaky. Which made up for the fact are little waitress with glasses was MIA! ."}
{"text":"My Family and I went to our local Denny's, 1330 s power rd, mesa, Az 85206. There is a waitress by the name of Cassandra there who has waited on us before. She is a chatter box, but this hasn't ever been a problem, even though most of her chatter is about her complaining about her job and her customers she has had through out the day. Cassandra was sharing a story about when she worked at Whattaburger, she had a conflict with a male co-worker who made a comment she to her she took offense too. Cassandra than decided to tell us, \"He was jewish too, and made me wish at that moment he had been killed by the nazis in the holocaust.\" We froze! My husband immediately told her we are jewish! I said the conversation needed to stop now, and her response to me was, \"Whatever...\" and continued talking. My husband than told her the conversation was done. The person who was actually waiting on us walked over, and pulled Cassandra to the side. She speaks very loudly and there is no doubt others at the Denny's heard her. I've never had a hate speech said to me at Denny's or any other diner. Due to her anti-semitic remark, when she pulled away by her co-worker, we got up and went to pay our check and told our waitress to cancel the rest of our order. Our family member that was with us, at point of check out, noticed clearly a moderate sized cockroach emerging from the check out station to the host podium. I think a call to the ACLU, the local EcoLab technician, the Maricopa health department is in absolute necessity."}
{"text":"I was craving pancakes so I asked the hubby to take me to Denny's! Lol  I mean I don't expect much from a diner...you go there when you want diner type food, right? Lol.  The food...you can't really do wrong, it's pretty basic...so you get what you want and it's as expected.    The service is fantastic! Our server was the most calming and polite natured man ever!  Whenever we go to Denny's, we usually get served by him...too bad I can't remember his name right now.    It's rare that I go to Denny's but the service is usually why we go as well, they are just pleasant people."}
{"text":"Something has got to be done about this place I guess they are understaffed. .this is twice I walked out after waiting eight minutes and still not getting service. I've got a busy schedule ahead of me and I don't have time to sit around all day waiting for a server that isn't there.  ..but on the good side of things I found moon valley cafe to be a better deal $5.00 breakfast and they give you same size portions....good bye dennys.."}
{"text":"We travel a lot to Vegas and always stay on Freemont St.  Denny's is obviously a fast, cheap meal and something we look forward to waking up to in the morning. We have been there over 20 something times and never have anything bad to say about it. The place is clean, the servers are ok and the food taste like Denny's. This last trip has me never wanting to go back and it is a shame.  We ordered food to go for the family and a meal was forgotten. We did not realize it till we were far away. We were upset but nothing a refund could not change. I called the location and told them what happened. The girl who said she was the manager apologized and said \"Sorry, that chick forgot to put it in the bag.\" Very unprofessional attitude and weak communication skills. Surprised she is your manager. Well we asked for a refund and she said the opening manager could handle it the next day. The next day we went to Denny's for breakfast. After our meal was finished I asked to speak to a manager to speak about the refund. The manager said it would be a few days till the refund hit our account. Understandable. Well the end of this story, the refund never came.  I understand things can happen, like forgetting to put a meal inside the bag but when you say you are going to refund a person then REFUND them. You have officially lost our family as customers. Thanks Denny's. John-{aul 454896 9-29-14 11:58 (Ticket/server Number the next day)"}
{"text":"So we was over at IHOP and it was a bit of a wait for a booth cause we always sit at a booth at IHOP for a total of 6. So we called dennys down the street and asked JoSe what's the wait he stated 10-15 mins not long then I asked what the wait for a booth for a party of 6 he stated not long so we left IHOP and went to Denny's. We go inside and was told that they don't even have booths that seat 6 and I asked for JoSe and he is the manager and said he never told me that on the phone I'm like well that's why we left IHOP cause we was looking for a booth and the wait was long for a booth. So we ended up at a table. So we ordered and our food was like room temp warm and got cold very fast. Manny was a nice server and helpful.. other than that next time I'll stick to where we always go and that's IHOP"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at lunch time, expecting it to be pretty busy with the church crowd. To our pleasant surprise it was not too busy.  We spent well over an hour in here, waiting about 45 minutes for our simple orders off eggs, sausage, and bacon to arrive. The server told us after 25 minutes they were running 30 minute ticket times, food was only coming in the window about every 15 minutes or so... How it's that slow at Denny's is beyond me. We were not even asked how our party of four wanted the checks together or separate, so spent 10 more minutes waiting for the hostess to split them up. Easily the worst service I have experienced and no way we will ever return."}
{"text":"The food is on the good side..the place always seems like it could use a good cleaning..and the service could be a bit faster."}
{"text":"The worst dennys ever. I ordered my food 9:47 , pick up was in 20mins. I reached there on time, they couldnt find my order, they first said they dint receive my order, and then said they closed the ticket, started looking here and there. They called  the manager- a filipino lady, who seems like she did not even care about customer service, never apologised for my cold food, or the poor customer service.  SO UNPROFESSIONAL !!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Food took an hour to be served and it felt as if it had been sitting out for awhile. Looking around I could tell we were not the only ones having problems."}
{"text":"For starters the timeliness of someone even recognizing you've entered the restaurant is about 5min. Then you get seated and perhaps 10min later someone will take an order for drinks. Management you should really staff of and make sure your hostess, wait staff and bus services are not the same and sole individual. The first time we came here a few months ago we ended up leaving after sipping on water for 20 min without having our order taken."}
{"text":"When we travel- we usually avoid chains because we want to try something new.  However, this Denny's has a full bar- so we went here just for the novelty of it.  In fact, it was a planned destination.  And we were VERY disappointed!  Due to a skiing accident, my daughter is in a wheelchair.  A server 'seated us' by throwing a couple of menus on a table, pointing as she continued walking to the back of the diner.  Since we had just come from a show at the Smith Center Theater- we went to the restroom and returned to OUR table to find other people sitting there! (That is why a Host/hostess should be seating guests- not servers) We gathered our things and from across the room, were told to sit at the next table.  However, that table was not handicap/wheelchair accessible- and again from across the room- we were told to sit at another table.  Needless to say, it was not a great start to our dining experience.  Granted- it's Denny's- and we didn't expect a coat & tie experience, but this was the worst!  We placed our order, and once we received it, no one ever came by to check on our order, refill drinks or see if we needed anything.  I had to flag down two different servers to request mustard.  After we finished eating, our dishes were not removed and the server seemed irritated that we chose to order cocktails after dinner.  We enjoyed our drinks, and I must say- the Cosmo was one of the better ones I have ever had, it was the service or the lack of that I had problems with.  I stood in line to pay and then went back to the table to retrieve my daughter, since the space between the door and the register was tight.  I was stopped at the door by a \"Security\" woman demanding to see my receipt- the very same woman who stood there and watched me pay to begin with.  This was a problem because the receipt was tossed into the bag on the back of my daughter's wheelchair- so I had to dig it out.  And then, she stood at the door, never offering to open or hold the door, and like I said, it was a tight space, so turning around so that I could back us out the door was awkward.  Thankfully- another customer on his way in opened the door for us.  Will this Denny's survive?- probably because of it's location.  Will it thrive? Eh??  I definitely will not be back, and will advise all those I know not to bother. The service was so bad, it makes one question the integrity of the kitchen and kitchen staff."}
{"text":"We stopped to grab some breakfast Saturday morning and upon walking in we were told it was at least a 30 minute wait.  There was a decent crowd waiting to be seated to eat, and were all told about the same thing. The odd thing was that there was a ton of open seating! The entire Bar area was unoccupied, as were all the tables outside but one. We wanted to sit outside and enjoy some food. She told us If we wanted to eat at either of those places we would still have to wait the 30 min. There was a Santa 5k that morning.  Sounds like poor planning to be unprepared for what could have been a lucrative morning for the restaurant.  We ended up leaving and going to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Took them around 20 minutes to sit us down and it was not busy at all and then they were backed up with food orders. Manager was rude to his customers and his employees very unprofessional and took a whole hour to get our food. Our food was warm and I was never served my garlic bread I've been here on busier days and it was not as horrible as tonight."}
{"text":"yikes, went here for a late night snack and this was quite shocking. my chicken was way undercooked (fleshy, raw, cold, and extra pink in the middle), luckily we were splitting, otherwise i would've found out the hard way.   they rushed to get us our second burger and when it came out, the bacon wasn't cooked all the way either.   very disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots , nice & clean , lots of space , cool service & there's never a wait .."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good, but the kitchen was way backed up. The food was good. Don't come here if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We waited 35 minutes to get waited on and waited 35 more minutes before we asked to see a manager. He then was the one to bring out our food well after we'd been there over an hour. Other tables which had arrived after us in the neighboring \"section\" had already been served, ate, and had left. The fix??? $5 off our bill. Ugh! Do not eat here!!! Worst experience in service we've ever had!!! We are barely going to make the Brewers game on time, and we wanted to be to the game early for Bobblehead day. Manager is VERY inexperienced. :("}
{"text":"It's Denny's but on the strip!  Meat lover's omelet is a great follow up to a down night of gambling.  Just makes you feel like a million bucks."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat here.  So I rarely go to Denny's, really I only order one thing that I occasionally get a craving for.  Anyway I walked in knowing what I wanted.  I got seated and handed a menu and was told somebody would be right with me.  15 minutes later and ive watched other tables come in and immediately get to order.  In my time waiting I even made eye contact with one of the servers as she went about her job.  I don't know why I got ignored, but eventually I'd had enough and left.  Really, this restautant is not the type of place where people will tolerate shitty service just to eat the food.  Independence has 50 other restaurants, I'll go elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!  Mashed potatoes came out dry as all hell NO MANAGER in the building...."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday morning (around 11am) for breakfast.  The manager led us to our table almost immediately and server came by to introduce herself almost right away.  So far so good right? Yes, but that's basically all the good during this visit.  Server came back to take our order and she seemed very rush and was almost pushing us to order faster.    We waited almost 30 minutes for our food.  The food itself was average, just typical breakfast foods.  The best part was the hash browns!  The hollandaise sauce on the eggs Benny tasted like a powder mix you can buy at a grocery store.  Back to our server... She was so busy running around, I couldn't even wave her down to get a coffee refill!  We were finally able to wave her down after our breakfast to get our bill.  When I asked for the bill, she asked if I wanted more coffee..Didn't even mention the fact that she never came by the table once.  To end, average food, terrible service."}
{"text":"My first time to Dennys in over 15 years? We got seated quickly,drinks were offered promptly followed by orders. The food came rather quickly so no long waits other than near the end when I had to flag someone to pay. Over great food, great portions and prices, didnt expect anything more or less so great experience. The salted caramel and banana cream pancakes were AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"The coffee's no gourmet, but our waitress, Sheree, the poppin music, and the chicken strips made it worth the midnight trip."}
{"text":"My family & I always have a great time here.  We even run into our friends.  Great spot for a compfy meal.  Only downside is no wifi."}
{"text":"Home of Linndale, OH known for traffic ticket revenue, but anyway....  I like this Denny's. Have taken my family & have had business luncheons there too.  I do plan on visiting again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever my guy. I asked for cheddar cheese and got pepper jack, we never got our syrup, and we also never got a stack of pancakes we ordered. To make matters worse the servers name was Manny but he spelt it Manie. Smh never going back again my guy."}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars but I cant. My boyfriend and I went in for breakfast and we were greeted by the very friendly hostess (she gets 4 stars). After about a 5 minute wait our waitress came over and finally asked us if we would like something to drink. She took our drink order and food order at the same time. We got our coffee and as we were talking we overheard the manager telling another waiter that the hostess sucks. Well manager if she sucks then you need to train her better. She did a great job. We finally got our food and the hash browns were cold and my boyfriends eggs were cold. She never once came by to see if we needed anything or to refill our coffee. She had maybe 2 other tables and the place was dead.  When we left to pay our tab we had to wait for the hostess to check us out because apparently thats also her job. My boyfriend is a server so I always over tip but yesterday I barely left a tip. This place used to be good but not anymore. I will never go back to this Dennys ever again. I will go to Henderson from now on."}
{"text":"Came here for our annual Christmas dinner & movie. I have to be Honest, I have never been a fan of Denny's. In my experience the service has always been poor at best and the food usually matches. I am very happy to say that this was NOT the case this time. Our waitress (Stacey)  was friendly, fast and always smiling. Our food was served hot and in a timely fashion. I believe this location has figured out how to keep people coming back........ Good food served fast and friendly staff. Simple."}
{"text":"it's dennys, long wait for food, lackluster service and a hair in the eggs that tasted like vinegar make this a visit that I hope we will all soon forget. It made me feel cheap and dirty, like I needed a shower after having ate a turkey burger with a stale bun. =-("}
{"text":"OMG I was so excited to dine at the newly remolded Denny's in Fountain Hills. Upon entering we were impressed by the new atmosphere. we were greeted by a young man who attempted to humor us when we asked for a booth saying there were none available and their would be a 20 minute wait. Every booth was empty...ha ha. We were sat in a booth and sat there for 15 minutes with no service. Employees were wandering around in a daze. Another table was sat right next to us AFTER we came in and were served drinks. We sat amazed as employes kept passing by us in a daze as if we didn't exist. The couple next to us asked a waitress for a refill on their coffee and she took about 5 more steps before that request registered in her brain. We decided to leave and as we walked by the young man who sat us, all he said was have a good night! He had to have known we were never even served or maybe he was too sauced up! Denny's needs to remodel their employees or send them all to rehab!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about coming in tonight based off all the negative reviews recently. To my delight, I was pleasantly surprised. My family and I went in a little after 9pm on a holiday weekend night. We did not see a hostess but were told from within the kitchen that we would be seated soon. Once seated, moments later, our waiter Kell got our drink orders and returned quickly with them. We got this same service through the whole meal. Quick order, quick food (which was tasty), always attentive service. So I am not sure if coming in after bar hopping at 3am means poor service or not, but tonight was ideal. Thank you for your great service, Kell!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Was not greeted..Waited about 5 mins or more to be sat down. Once sat down we waited another 30 minutes before asking what we would like to order, waited another 40 minutes before receiving food, food wasent that great..not a fan and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went here recently and my waitress was quite rude. She told us while she was taking our order that she was the end of her shift. Then after we were eating for a while, she started to take our plates away while we were still eating. Then she came over and told us she needed to give us our bill because her shift had ended, but that she couldn't leave until we did. I felt really awkward and rushed out.  Then when we went to pay, my boyfriend and I wanted to split the bill between 2 credit cards, and the man who rang us up didn't know how so we couldn't split up the payment. Usually Denny's can let customers split the bill if they want to. If the guy at the register didn't know how to do something simple, he should just ask a coworker instead of inconveniencing the customer.   Another time I came here, they wouldn't even seat us. The waitress made eye contact with us several times without saying anything. (The place was practically empty and there were at least 10 booths free). Eventually she walked by and quickly said it'll be 15 minutes until she could seat us... but didn't take down our name or anything. We kept waiting and then eventually just left and went somewhere else to eat.   This location is the worst Denny's I've been to usually I like to go here but I'm definitely not going to return to this one."}
{"text":"Came in today and it was super busy. I was surprised the wait was only 15 minutes since this is a new location. The host was very friendly and even asked if we wanted a booth or table. We got to our table and our waitress was super nice. She took our order and kept our drinks filled. I got the blueberry pancakes combo. Everything was very good and the food was hot. We will be back for sure. Glad we have more breakfast options now in Gastonia with Denny's!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, it was me and my mom. We got seated right as we walked in, our waitress,Jade, didn't do a great job of serving us. We got tiny water cups as she gave other people bigger cups for water. We ordered our food and it took atleast an hour for us to get it, my mom ordered the Country fried steak and the gravy on top of the steak was cold and had a coating. I ordered the Grand Slam, I had all bacon instead of 2 bacon and 2 sausage links but she didn't listen to what I ordered. My food was cold, and my eggs were runny. And lastly we were done and wanted to leave and it took 20 minutes for us to get our check. We had to ask the manager to get our check. As we go to pay Jade came and asked if we found our check. I will never go to that location ever again."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this location. The experience was great. The server was nice but I was disappointed because I got here after 11am second time asking for the soup of the day and they tell me it's not ready mind you they said they start serving at 11. The servers answer was \"it's too busy right now, sorry\" then I suggest to remove it off their menu if that's Constantly happening. This was my second time asking for the soup of the day."}
{"text":"horrible service.  Chit chatting, and singing all morning, but service almost could not be found.    Went to bathroom to for a number 2, NO TOILET PAPER in both stalls.  Had to use my hand and toilet water to clean up.  I'm glad I shook the waiter's hand really firmly.   Asked for soft bacon and well done sausage. That seemed to go unheard.  Got the usual crusty crispy ass f.... bacon and mushy soft ass sausage. Got coffee after I was seated and i knew that was all I was getting as nobody came by to check to see if I needed more coffee... No water in sight either."}
{"text":"Denny's was bad yesterday! They were crowded and couldn't open the other side of the restaurant to seat people due to lack staff. When we finally sat down, it took forever to get someone to take a drink order. There was no sugar on the table for the coffee. I had to ask and it never came so I had to get it from another table. I don't eat meat and did not order any. My plate came with bacon strips laid on top of all my food!! They forgot the grits for all of our food and we were almost done eating by the time they came. This was a horrible experience!"}
{"text":"Arrived to find the place nearly empty at midnight! Waited 10 full minutes until a woman comes over and seats me. She informs me that  the kitchen is absolutely swamped and it will be a while until I get my food. I asked her how long, she says about an hour or two! THERE ARE REALLY ABOUT SIX PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE RESTAURANT! No one has any food at all! The waitress tells me that the manager won't her take my order...at all!  Needless to say that I left and went to Waffle house!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick breafast here since we'd received a giftcard from an online promotion.  Clean and bright.  We were seated promptly.  Food took a long while to arrive considering the restaurant was largely empty.  Server was surly, but I suppose I might be surly working at Denny's as well.  Received a plain omelet when egg white was ordered; Let it go since we were in a hurry.  \"Seasonal\" fruit cup was one slice of a banana, grapes and some honey dew.  Since when are bananas, grapes or honeydew a seasonal fruit in May?  Toast already came buttered/greased.  Food was exceedingly small-portioned given the prices.  Haven't been in a Denny's in a long while, but if that's what any indication of the food or service is like typically... then it'll again be a long while...  The only plus is they take AMEX.  Would recommend any local greasy spoon over Denny's."}
{"text":"This Denny's is great. The hosts and servers are always responsive and helpful. I met the manager, David, and it was clear that customer service is important to them. He even asked me if I used Yelp which was cool. Denny's always has their 2, 4, 6, and $8 specials. It's a great value and with wifi access, I always take an hour or two to get work work done when I'm there."}
{"text":"#176  Having a fever most of the morning with it finally breaking late in the afternoon, I was craving pancakes and eggs.  I thought, why not Denny's?  I got a ride with my bestie to this location since it is by Crowfoot LRT Station since I have to find my own way home.  We arrived and thankfully it is not that busy.  We we promptly seated by a pleasant wait staff (does the gender really matter, if so, check yourself before you wreck yourself).  I proceeded to get the Peanut Butter Cream Pancakes for 12.19 which includes two pancakes with chocolate and white chips baked in covered with peanut butter cream, 2 eggs, hash browns, and a choice of bacon or link sausage. I think I got the phosphates narrowed down.  I proceeded to consider to order toast (because what breakfast does not need toast) when I noticed it was 2.89 for just two (2) slices. Seriously???!!! I can buy a whole loaf of Wonder Bread for 2.59 or less in RETAIL. We all know that restaurants never pay RETAIL unless it is an emergency (and we know most places especially fast food do not use name brand because of the \"cost\"). If it had $1.49, I would feel it is reasonable.  I gave two stars for the pleasant staff and seemingly clean restaurant.  New year, new rules and expect more value for my $'s and this is not cutting it. But knowing that the choices to get breakfast at 1600 in the afternoon are severely limited, I guess we have to put up with this? If I start to cook, a lot more restaurants would close."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Denny's since I was a teenager. I'm now 21 and just had the shittiest experience of my life. I ordered a Cali club sandwich without bacon or ham and they gave me a sandwich with just tomato and lettuce? When I asked for avocado and turkey, they put it on the side for me to add myself?! I went up to the manager and explained the situation to him. This manager is always there whenever I'm there by the way. He took my sandwich back and gave me a completely new one, extra avocado, and brand new fries with a side of pickles. Then he gave me two milkshakes instead of one. The manager's name is Fernando. This man is INCREDIBLE. I have never had such a good customer service experience, this man made my day. He even told me and my friend \"you guys are regulars, next time don't even get a menu, just ask for me and I got you guys\". Completely changed my entire dining experience. I am so happy and satisfied. Thank you so much Fernando!!! (He was so good once I even gave him a $40 tip for like an $11 meal, this man is incredible and genuinely cares about the customers. Now I will come back happily just to have such an amazing eating experience again. :)"}
{"text":"The food and service was great! I had a double cheeseburger it was delicious. My hubby got French toast and his was tasty too. Great place for a late night dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Firstly, waited to be greeted...was met with zero friendliness nor apology from waitress. Waited way too long for our beverage refills. Waited way too long for our check. Messed up on my order twice, but did not say anything the second go around because I gave up and ate it anyway. Syrup tasted stale...just off. And as the other reviews stated...why is it so cold inside?! My coffee was cold within minutes. Go to Steve's for a prompt, warm, tasty breakfast."}
{"text":"Good food, and a nice place for good company.  good service"}
{"text":"The service was excellent with Darcy as our waitress and the cook Rick did an excellent job with our early morning food."}
{"text":"Not sure what makes this Denny's in Arizona better than any Denny's I've been to in California, but it is much better. As a rule, I avoid Denny's in California. Portions are always cheap and quality almost nonexistent. At this location in Phoenix, they always serve fair portions and the quality is good.   If you like Denny's, you'll really like this location. Typical menu."}
{"text":"The restaurant is not terrible, but service can be spotty. The wait time can vary, and every now and then you get a new server that connect a little bit unprofessional. However, there is a regular server I always look for whenever I come into this restaurant. She is what makes it worth coming back every time. Sheree, we love you!"}
{"text":"Went to this Denny's with friends after a cancelled class. Service was quick, but not patient. We need a little extra time to look over the menu and the server rolled her eyes before heading off. Wasn't busy when we went. The food all seemed cooked, but wasn't hot. Should have taken the hint because now I have food poisoning. Do not go to this location."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!!   1) I wanted to call in an order, but couldn't get a response from ANYONE calling several times and no response so that didn't happen.   2) I had 2 separate \"to go\" orders.   First issue was with the sampler plate, strawberry smoothy, cheesecake order.  I went a couple miles back home and opened my food and...  there wasn't any cheesecake!!!  So I don't even know it's any good.   My sampler plate was of poor quality.  The mozzarella cheese sticks were not hot enough and at least 3 of them were hollowed out and the cheese didn't even melt. I didn't like the spicy chicken (2 strips) which wasn't really what I wanted. I wanted fried zucchini.  The onion rings were many, but I didn't care for them.  3) I wanted to get an adjustment without having to go right back there.  I tried the dennyslistens.com and to my dismay I came to my next issue...  4) I needed to locate some numbers and I realized that the ink in that printer is almost gone... It was  IMPOSSIBLE because I couldn't  read enough of the numbers because they were missing or unrecognizable which brings me to my next issue...   5)  how do you contact Denny's customer service?    6) 1t's the reason you are reading this right now... So we'll see what happens next..   BTW everything was remarkably quick, though, but they FAILED because there were omissions...   Miriam is the name on the receipt.   I can't go back there right now so I am just wondering if I'll ever get compensation returned... Waiting...."}
{"text":"Coming here is a hit or miss and typically the later in the day, the worse the service. Came in tonight and it took forever to get sat and then no one even acknowledged me once I was finally sat by the manger who had just gotten told off by another guest. I ended up leaving to fine somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's breakfast- it shouldn't be that hard to get it right...!  I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Omelet because the picture made it look awesome.  I could practically taste it w my eyes.  What I received was scrambled eggs w cheese w some toppings thrown in between.  Doesn't ANYONE mix the toppings into the eggs anymore???  It's almost like the toppings were an afterthought.  Is this what we expect and willing pay for...?  And their coffee... Is... Nasty..."}
{"text":"Yesterday we came here and were sat immediately, our service was great! She kept our coffee full and made sure we were well taken care of. Myself and my family can be a little rowdy sometimes but they didn't mind. I ordered the sticky bun pancake breakfast and they put the most drizzle on the pancake than any other Denny's! It was awesome! Eggs were cooked well and hash browns were perfect! It was a great time"}
{"text":"Asked for chocolate chips and bananas on my pancakes & even though it is not on the menu they politely did it for me. Great and quick customer service."}
{"text":"I understand it is on the strip and busy, but if your going to post a sign in your door stating wait time...update it The service was really less than favorable. And really only one kids menu in the entire restaurant.  Food was average as usual at Denny's."}
{"text":"The Best Denny's I've experienced, and we've tried quite a few. The newer Denny's are a good bet when traveling. I decided on brunch, and had a make-it-your-way grand slam and a side of grits and a gluten free English muffin. I was amazed at how good the muffin was. Moist and light and not at all crumbly. Everything was served exactly as I wished and was very good. My husband had a great salad, and our friend had the grand slam sandwich, which was good. Our waitress (Tina) was terrific. Fast, efficient, smiling, attentive. Couldn't ask for better."}
{"text":"For a Denny's in a little hole-in-the-wall casino that seems to mostly deal in free breakfast vouchers from the attached Days Inn, this place is surprisingly clean, comfy and well-run with good service. I only went for breakfast early on but it was never crowded and the food was at least passable. Sportscenter up on 2 TVs that you can see from wherever you sit too."}
{"text":"Total rip off and sub-par food in my opinion!   Went here for breakfast and discovered the birthday free deal is on the \"original grand slam\" which is eggs, sausage, beacon and pancake only. A cup of coffee was almost three bucks! Add my son's french toast, milk and juice - and $3.69 extra charge for my hash brown the total came to $$39.71 before b-day discount. With discount the breakfast came to $28.08 after tax.  Now this rant isn't so much about the outrageous bill as it is about how much I had to paid for a sub par meal. For the after discount $ I would have had a better meal at Cora's, Sunset Grill or Fran's. Holy crap.   Spoke to the manager who I could barely understand (his English) but that just amounted to me having cent of my surprise and frustration.  I was a fan of Denny's (back when I lived in Vancouver) but this sucky experience means no love for the chain from now on.  I recommend going to the other places I mentioned above instead, well before stepping into a Denny's in Toronto."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to grab a quick breakfast. I was alone so I sat at the bar. The coffee was good surprisingly. They have a bold blend and it wasn't bad. I order an egg white omelette and my server seamed to be confused... She asked if I wanted cheese on it lol. Food was good better than most other Denny's I've been to. If your in town and don't want to break the bank ( food is very expensive in Vegas) I'd suggest coming here."}
{"text":"Plates were dirty and chipped. The staff was inattentive and the food was as good as all Denny's ,."}
{"text":"30 minutes passed sitting there until finally one of the servers asked if we had been taken care of. My meal was cold, and everyone else in our group who ordered chicken got it served raw including my little nephews chicken tenders. Terrible, someone couldve gotten seriously ill. Not to mention we had to remind the server we needed cutlery to eat our meals. I got cold soup with no spoon!"}
{"text":"After we were seated our waiter never came. We had to ask another waiter after 20 mins to get our drinks. We ordered our food and waited 45 mins! The eggs were cold and hash browns not cooked. Dana was our server and she was just terrible! Worst Denny's ever!!!"}
{"text":"This particular Denny's was super fast, waitress was friendly and  food was incredible!"}
{"text":"The hostess took our name and asked how many guests but didn't tell us how long of a wait it would be.  Once we were seated the waitress asked what we wanted to drink but didn't tell us her name and she had the hostess bring is our drinks. My mom asked if she could have a coffee said shook her head yes but didn't ask how she wanted her coffee.  If you have an attitude you do not need to work in customer service or as a waitress."}
{"text":"Some times one just wants food so we go to Denny's. We never go with any expectations other than it is a Denny's So we get what we expect, simple food prepared in a simple way. Being greeted with a smile is what we get along with good quick service. The place is clean as well are the toilets. Some times the other customers are a hoot to watch, but usually just folks out for a bite."}
{"text":"Denny's is Denny's. I mean really, what are expecting? The service is chipper and quick, the food comes out lightening fast and the servings are big. It's classic American diner and it's CHEAP. It's not a beautiful little hole in the wall Mom & Pop diner, but this is Vegas, and those places don't exist on the strip, so Denny's it is. This particular Denny's is upstairs and in my opinion there are two places to sit that make a pretty awesome place to eat, the first is by the window overlooking the strip, the second is at the counter during a busy breakfast service.  I don't need to tell you what we ordered, it's Denny's."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place isn't shut down. Terrible service and the grill obviously wasn't cleaned, my egg had burnt pieces of something stuck to them. It tasted and looked like someone tried to cook the egg on a BBQ. This is the worst Denny's I've ever been to. One star because they seated us quick when we arrived."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Denny's FOREVER and I have gotten the shittiest, slowest service I have ever gotten EVER.   One, the cook needs to go back to training. The food is bland, my dish specifically was BURNT to the point where it was hard as rocks. The cook left out sooo many ingredients for my dish as well as my group's food.   Two, the waitress was so s l o w. About 2 weeks ago, I went late night and it was her FIRST NIGHT WORKING AND SHE WAS THE ONLY WAITRESS. There were 5 tables that needed service and the groups were 4-6 people. This past time I went, Friday night, same waitress BY HERSELF. There were 2 groups of 4 people who were there and the waitress was MIA when we arrived. We waited 8 minutes before we were even greeted and decided to seat ourselves because we were STARVING. It took us 30 minutes to even get drinks, then it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By then, we were pissed but just so damn hungry so we stayed and waited. It took us another 35 minutes to get our food and it was disgusting.   Please save yourself and do not eat at this Denny's."}
{"text":"I had come through Vegas to this Dennys with my band and our tour package, of which was a large group of people. Our waitress was new to the store and she was still learning the process of her job. Her name is Retno. She had let us know she was new, as well as her co-workers. She did very well! We are all very understanding that she is new. At the end of the meal, Laurie was helping Retno to divide the bills amongst us. She was very rude and angry towards her new coworker. Rather than helping her to understand, she had been very assertive. Using phrases like \"I'm going to lose it.\" Laurie was not rude to us, just to her co-worker. Retno did a very well job as a new employee. And the food was great!"}
{"text":"Has a wonderful staff. There was no wait to get a table.  The manager offered to give me a very professional foot massage while I read the menu. I politely declined the offer but was pleasantly surprised by the chorus of angelic singers that gently softly sang behind me as I looked over the menu.  I ordered the club sandwich, on whole wheat. It arrive very quickly under threat of violence by the staff if it took too long. I watched through the window as the head chief stalked a wild turkey with nothing more than a broom handle and a clever.  My meal was served with a fountain coke-a-cola, which was a little flat. But my waiter promptly replaced it with a fresh one, then removed the failed machine and committed seppuku for dishonouring the grand establishment.  When the bill came I was very disappointed. It was the price I expected but there was no hand written smiley face as is customary. So despite their efforts, I can not recommend this establishment to royalty but the commoners are free to nourish themselves there."}
{"text":"With the love bug the best dennys we been too so far friendly staff out server ROBERT D is awesome fast and on time with everything even when busy very attentive guy and professional our food was hot was worried the grits would be cold but we were shocked they were not based on pass experience with other Denny's Restaurants this one is by far the best. Everyone that works here are very fast paced and we will be back the noise level was ok didn't bother us again the food was great as hell excuse my French but man I can't wait to come back in October I hope Robert still works here on our next vacation.!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this Dennys!!! It's not like yoir typical ghetto Dennys! It's clean and the staff is awesome. From the hostess, servers and the manager is wonderful! He is always present when we go and the kids love talking to him. Our kids are obsessed  with the claw machine and always win big. Tonight they won 6. The servers are all good but tonight Patrick was exceptional.  He was great on his timing and making sure our drinks were fresh. Our food was great and was correct. Even after we were done he came over and asked multiple times of we needed anything. The all laugh and interact with the kids. We love this Dennys. Ps we love the new lights, we can actually see the menus and each other. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service by the waitress.  Food was good and served in a time manner. Had banana split for dessert, skimpy to say the least.  New establishment, just opened at this location.  Ample parking, restroom could have been a bit cleaner, 9 year old came out of it, did a good job destroying.  LOL  Will go back again, standard Denny's food menu."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's in a low budget neighborhood... Service wasn't too bad don't think I would come back to this particular location but overall tmy waitress was good."}
{"text":"Dennys, whats has happened to you? This visit  turned out to be like other visits to Dennys locations in California. Long waits for food that is warm at best."}
{"text":"Marti was amazing!  She worked quickly and multi tasked very well.  The food was fresh and delicious.   My order was to go and they certainly delivered on my expectations.   I will return to this location and recommend it very highly."}
{"text":"Worst dennys I ever came to. I came here last Saturday morning with my friends like at 3-4AM. Bad service! The waitress took our orders. She didn't give us our utensils until 10 mins after our food came out. By the time the food came out, we weren't even hungry anymore. Our food came out in like 30-1 hr and our drinks came out like 10 mine before our food. The pancake puppies were so burnt! I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. Denny's is always my go to for breakfast food in California which I am orginally from but if I come back to Vegas I will NOT be eating here . The server that we had named IZZAT was very very rude and disconnected. He had smart remarks throughout the whole service and never once did apologize for spilling water all over my friends and I . He also bought the food out cold on purpose which extended the already long wait . Seeing that I've worked in service before I understand that when things get hectic sometimes workers forget the correct way to operate a business BUT that does not give employees the pass to disregard the well being of the customer. When we finally finished the food and went to the front and told the cashier lady that the service was below sub par she gave a giggle and did nothing about it . The tab was $40.00s but we left him $0 tip for the simple fact the dining experience  as anything far from comfortable or perfect. This Denny's is highly unorganized and the workers are very detached from the people their serving . Get rid of workers like IZZAT and you'll be better off Denny's ."}
{"text":"Horrible service, as I walked in the server was taking a picture and made me wait till she got the right one and edit it !!!!! Then I got sick of waiting for her fat ass so I went and I sit my self in the bar since I was alone, after 10 min another server is looking at me to ask me if I wanted the menu like I was sitting there just for fun. Definitely never coming back to this location even its 2 blocks away from my house. And it's my birthday."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today 3/13/18  Ordered and waited and waited.  When our order came (2 burgers) they did not have the sides we ordered and were so over cooked we would not eat them showed the waitress and complained she didn't know what to do so we left.  This place is going down hill fast."}
{"text":"Really slow service and non existent customer base. There was no reason for my mom, husband, and myself to wait 45 minutes for our food.  I had a loaded veggie omelet which was good but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great waffles. Breakfast all day. Just awesome. Waitress will work with you.  Explain everything."}
{"text":"Loved the service at this location! Misty was my server and she was amazing! She was very fast, friendly, checked up on us numerous times, etc! The manager was walking around asking if the customers were enjoying their food & stuff. I love when managers do that because I can tell them how well their server is doing and such. The food was also amazing! I ordered that cinnamon pancake dish and it was sooooo yummy! Will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Holy cow.. Found myself searching for grub in the middle of the night, Crystal and Summer did not disappoint. Now I've been to Denny's many times, but this was hands down my best experience EVER! Best meal I've had in quite a while. Thanks again ladies, you rock!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Coffee was good and that was why I stopped here, but I had been wanting the recently advertised pumpkin pancakes I'd seen on TV. I ordered them but they were NOT pumpkin pancakes, just buttermilk with the spiced topping. It was disappointing. Service was okay but just okay."}
{"text":"Worst break fast place ever. No vegetarian options. They offer replacements for meat and eggs but at extra cost."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars for today's meal. The fact that the server is alone and waiting on EVERYONE is ridiculous! I complained about my meal and was given a \"sorry\" but why should i pay for this slop?! Shame on u Denny's on camelback and 7th. Not to al the others. I like those."}
{"text":"This place is so sad. It used to be my favorite restaurant, but the last three times I've been here I haven't been happy. The service is slow. I've had to ask for silverware and napkins. And they consistently get the orders wrong. I think this will be the last time I'll eat here."}
{"text":"We were very happy with the service here the waiter was really nice and our food was good and brought to us quickly.  We go to a lot of different Dennys across the country and this is one of the good ones. We will return."}
{"text":"So this is the \"other Denny's.\" We usually end up at the Wilson Mills one, but Easter Sunday found us at the park and we went here instead.   There was only one section being seated and only one waitress in the section. We could tell since it took a while to get our drinks and for the waitress to come take our order.   However when we did put in our order, it came out fast. Strangely enough, my sandwich was a lot smaller than the one I get at Wilson Mills. Even my husband noticed.   It took a while to get the check after that, too. We were about to go ask for it when the waitress appeared with it.   All in all it's Denny's and a lot of people don't expect much when they go there. This was better than most people expect, but the service was not as good as what we usually get at Wilson Mills."}
{"text":"This is a very nice and convenient location.   Visited late Sat morning and the place was hopping with a crowd of all ages.   There were several large families 8+ and a few solo diners.  They have a meeting room that can be opened to handle meetings or large groups.  They have tables and booths and a small counter.   The diner decor has a fresh fifties flare.    They have a takeout counter with some seating while you wait.   Free wifi   Like all Denny's they have a wide menu selection.  Companions got lunch burger and the Cali Club; I selected a breakfast slam meal.   We all enjoyed our meals and service was very fast which surprised us given the large crowd and many large groups.     Our server was a nice young man who was prompt, courteous and on the move without being intrusive.   Very glad they opened this location in the neighborhood.  Nice addition."}
{"text":"Good food and attentive service.  Recently remodeled location.  Too cold to sit outside, so we dined inside.  Service was good and quick.   Our Grand Slams were just as we ordered."}
{"text":"Shoutout to the server, Juanita. She did great waiting on our table. But our food took about 30 minutes to come out! Other than that, the experience was fine--just wish our food had come out a little bit faster."}
{"text":"I hate writing really bad reviews about places anywhere I eat, but this place, on this night deserves less than one star... I ordered Moons Over My Hammy... what a joke.   The ham was one sliver of ham lunch meat. I wish I had taken a pic, it was seriously laughable. Generally when I get questionable service I won't complain, bad food I will and I did.  Their solution you ask? They offered me a Sundae for desert.  The folks behind us had been their prior to us sitting down. When their meals finally came, they started complaining about it being incomplete and wrong... Something about a cold steak and no dinner rolls. When we left, they were just getting a makeup order.  The place wasn't that packed *shock* and it seemed it took forever to get anything. I eventually had to flag a waiter over to ask for more iced tea as the service just wasn't up to par either.  Just for kicks I did a search for Dennys Moon Over My Hammy sandwich, almost fell off my chair laughing at what it's supposed to look like.... I know, I know they never do... but seriously Dennys, one sliver of lunch meat?  Sorry Dennys, don't hold my table.  /end rant"}
{"text":"We went there tonight for dinner and I'm so upset that we spent 50 dollars on this place.  Server had an attitude like we weren't important.  Our food was taking a very long time for a skillet and 2 sandwiches and 2 kids grand slam. Not busy at all.  One of the sandwiches  came out about 9 minutes after our 4 meals came. We let the manager know... She apologized and never made it right. She said she would gives a discount but never did. Then I had to ask the waitress for a Togo box because she never returned. Just terrible all together.... And my 3 eggs of medium were not even running. Food was disgusting. I will never go there again. It is very sad they said they have new manager when they really don't care about costumes."}
{"text":"10/18/2015 - 1:27 am.  Got a Bacon Slamburger and egg was totally cook.  It seems that they warming up the burger in the Microwave.   Bread was soggy on the bottom bun, and I ask the egg over easy.   Told my restaurant manger my experience and she offer to replace, but I declined.  How would like to trust a cook who can't cook a egg.   Felt bad for the Servers Ashley.  Please address with cook.  Ruin my late night meal experience.   P.S.  Didn't help see the cook smoking up front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I were hungry after a long day.  We decided to go to the Denny's by our house.  When we got there we were seated right away and the waitress was friendly.  Right after she sat us at a booth she said she had to go make the dessert for another table.  She didn't take to long and brought us water.  The restaurant wasn't crowded but our waitress was the only person serving customers.  There was another lady who cleaned the table behind us but was slamming dishes in a bin and didn't look to happy.  After the waitress returned to get our order we waited and waited and waited for our food.  Then we waited some more.  I took almost an hour to get our food in a restaurant that had maybe six more tables of customers.  By the time we got our food it was cold."}
{"text":"Since you can't leave zero ratings on Yelp. We were excited to see that a Denny's was going to be closer to our home than Sun City. The decor was completed inadequately and there appeared to be some obvious code violations, the service was horrible, the food was over cooked, our server was rude and did not want to be at work and made a point of talking to the other servers about it. The manager was rude and dismissive. I'd be surprise me if this location lasts. We will go back to the SC location if we want to eat at a Denny's."}
{"text":"Just ate at the counter, was part way into my ultimate steak omelet when I watched the guy cooking the eggs begin eating with bars hands while cooking.  Lost my appetite, stopped eating went to pat my bill, and Manager at the register asked how everything was. I told her, She said that's not O.K.,  She was gonna have a talk with him and proceeded to process my $18 Bill with not so much as an apology or even a discount.   I won't bother coming back."}
{"text":"Man, where to begin? It's Denny's so I came in with low expectations, maybe that's my problem? Having a certain expectation of service ? No sense of urgency, no refills, everyone has their blinders on. The place doesn't work as a team but a me VS the other server attitude and it shows.   I may not be your guest this time but that doesn't mean I won't be next time. However, there won't be a next time. Need a new manager in here ASAP. Great location horrible management. I bet if you let me see the PnL it'd confirm I'm right.   I'll just make breakfast at home from here on out."}
{"text":"The food was great... if you get stuck with shannon as a server.... dont expect to see him expect to take your order and drop the check off... never came back to see how food was... offer refills of coffee or soda... actually went to yhe counter and had to gey somebody else to refill our drinks.. great food.. very terrible service from shannon."}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars??? Went to watch a movie with my sister and came to Denny's afterwards for a meal. Denny's was virtually empty and we were told it would take 20 mins to clean a station. I figured. Strange as it's empty, but no big deal. After 20 mins we were told at it was 11pm we would have to wait 30-40 mins for the new shift change.  At this point my party of 5 and the 7 other people waiting for a table at an empty Denny's left and went to the Boston pizza next door. Dave to say I will never be back, the manager was also quite rude!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my family want here and let me just tell yall the employees was so awesome our food was late and something want wrong the manager was so nice to fix the problem take care of the bill and the server made sure we was all around happy. This place have the best employees and management I have even had. I will be going back once a week now."}
{"text":"So...it's Denny's.  I wasn't expecting haute cuisine, but the food seems to be even lower quality than I remember. I ordered some Hobbit tie-in turkey dinner.  The meat was salty, the potatoes were most likely made from powder.  I liked the gravy, but I do like canned gravy (shhh).  The dinner even came with some canned cranberry sauce.  This place is pretty new and they keep it clean.  Parking was not a problem and it is convenient to Costco.  Next time I need a quick lunch I'll probably stop at Subway instead.  The turkey tastes about the same but I can put some fresh veggies on my turkey at Subway."}
{"text":"Tried this new Denny's for breakfast this morning,we were seated for a few minutes, when a waiter finally came over and took our order we asked for coffee and sat there for fifteen minutes waiting no coffee was ever brought so we got up and left! Ridiculous we then went to Cocos where as soon as we were seated hot coffee was brought."}
{"text":"Come on people, it's Denny's, if you're looking for five star dining, you're looking in the wrong place. On the other hand, if you want simple diner food and a decent breakfast, this is your place."}
{"text":"I live really close to this place and it's a solid Dennys. I've been there dozens of times. Sure you have the weekend breakfast crowds and it takes longer, but I've never had to wait very long even then. I think a lot of the nasty reviews are from people forgetting they are at Dennys. This isn't some fancy Scottsdale joint so lighten up people. And if you are one of those Scotsdale snobs, just turn around now and get out of my hood. We don't want you here.  The one thing I really, really wish they would fix (or at least notice) is that their exterior lighting at night is almost non-existent.  I think its kinda funny now because I've gotten used to it, but if you drive by this place on Bell and you didn't know it was there, there's a good chance you won't even notice it's there. A lot of their lights have been burned out FOREVER... get a ladder out there and replace the damn light bulbs!"}
{"text":"Went to Denny's tonight for a late night bite. Our server, Cebastien, was very friendly, attentive, was fun to talk with and had great energy. He was totally in control of everything going on in the restaurant though there was only one other server and steady business. There was an incident with another guest in the restroom and he handled it with professionalism and respect- something that you don't quite see anymore."}
{"text":"I hardly ever gone to dennys..but now there a great waiter there...I have never been so taken care of until now..he is sharp..frendly and very good at his job..if you go there ask for Angel...you will no b disappointed!!! And the dish washer is cool to."}
{"text":"What can I say about a Denny's. It was indeed a Denny's.  The service staff was very pleasant. And the food came out in record-setting time. Not one of my favorite places to eat but always good for steak and eggs :-)"}
{"text":"Grandlux was closed so we wandered the Vegas streets for some food. Relief at the Denny's sign! Yayyyy, took forever, but since its 24 hours u cant really complain. Cheap greasy and good 3am food."}
{"text":"This location is the worst. They dont listen when order is being taken because when you get your food its always wrong. When management  is told they do nothing to fix the problem."}
{"text":"LOVE this dennys!  Been here 3X in two weeks before leaving a review (wanted to make sure I was spot on) The people working have been the same because ive come in during the weekdays.  Each time they've been extremely busy, had to wait a couple minutes but no biggie.   All the servers are busting their butts off and ive seen one of them with sweat on her forehead. In the 3 times ive been there Ive never seen anyone standing around. its nice to see them constantly cleaning, serving and taking orders.   The 1st visit I ordered their new BYOB (build your own burger) its super easy and they have a list on the table to choose from, circle choices and then hand it to the waiter. makes it super easy and fast. Only 6.99 and lots of options. I got a grilled chicken on wheat with mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce and grilled onions, and i added bacon and avocado for $1 each. Got a salad as my side (which wasnt a choice but i asked) The sides are fries, hashbrowns, onion rings, or fruit.    It was at my table less than 10 mins later and simply delicious.  The following visit we came with a coupon (B1G1F), so i got the grand slam breakfast which includes your drink for 8 bucks. So for two people with drinks and tax it was 10 bucks. How can you beat that?! it included 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, hashbrowns (or fries), 2 pancakes. So filling and delicious.   By the third visit, the lady knew our name, what we wanted to drink and the sides we usually ask for. Service is speedy, great and friendly. Couldnt ask for more.  Dennys is great, cheap and i cant wait to come back.. especially with more coupons! (sign up for their rewards program online!)  BTW! BRING YOUR ID ON YOUR BIRTHDAY (NO COUPON NEEDED) AND GET A FREE GRAND SLAM BREAKFAST AT ANY LOCATION, ANY TIME! :)"}
{"text":"I tried to order for takeout and the person who answered the phone was extremely rude and basically did everything to NOT help me. I told her since she was being so rude I would take my business elsewhere. If you are going to offer a take out service maybe have a dedicated line that is not in the kitchen and stop blaming the customer when you can't hear."}
{"text":"Denny's is Dennys, breakfast food at a reasonable price, and what better place that the middle of the Las Vegas strip. They were really busy but got us in quick. I'm not sure how good that was because our food took over an hour and was incorrect, but our server was very nice (not efficient but nice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had just got off our flight an hour prior and were really hungry because we hadn't eatin' all day. So rather then lookng for a place to eat, we just went to Denny's.Boy was that a BIG MISTAKE!  We got our usual grand slams. Usually we'd be able to continue our day, but ten minutes after leaving Denny's we were racing back to the bathrooms. Then it was followed by an awful stomach ache. So not worth it. If it wasn't for some advil to relieve the pain I don't know how I would have gotten out of bed.  Only thing good was the service. Waiter was nice."}
{"text":"I one to a lot of Denny's and this was by far one of the best experiences! So great! The service was spot on and food was great!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the food was great . It would be a place to recommend to your acquaintances."}
{"text":"High functioning chaos :) I visited this location on a busy Saturday morning. I waited about 15 minutes to be seated and ended up at the counter with Jeanette. She is wonderful!! I watched the team of 30+ people work together so well to make sure everyone was fed and taken care of in a timely manner. The food is no better or worse than any other Denny's I've ever been to but this team was super impressive!!"}
{"text":"Generally, I love Denny's!  In this review I DO NOT love Denny's!  I have been to Denny's all over North America and this one left me wanting much more.  I had a Coke and the All-American Slam.  Toast was good, hash browns were soggy and under-browned, scrambled eggs were browned.  Sausage was okay and bacon was perfectly done.  Boyfriend had the avocado bacon burger.  He said it was underwhelming and lacking in flavour.    I love me some Denny's but this location has to step up its game.  Denny's could be so much more than a 2 star!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has herpes. Honestly I was so pissed off by time my lunch came at dinner time that we almost left."}
{"text":"Granted it's on the strip and VERY busy, but we (2 females) were sat next to an scary looking older guy who was in a corner by himself, and it was not the only table available. That was the first negative. We waited 20 mins and wasn't even offered drinks. The man next to us said he waited 30 mins for his food and it wasn't even that good. We walked out."}
{"text":"Guy with glasses hung up on me to put in A PICK UP cause i have before around this hour ,anywho being the loyal betch that I am I drove there anyway !!! I need my nachos !!! So i come in I said hello Im the person you hung up on ! Said my coke was on him  please ! Being a server myself you lost out on a tip my coke was on your tables money! Betch ! SO I GO HOME AND HALF MY ORDER WAS MISSING !! I USED TO WORK AT THIS LOCATION 8 YEARS AGO AND ITS A TRASHY RESTAURANT NOW WITH CRACKHEADS SLEEPING EVERY WHERE . Dumbest graveyard waiter ! Ever !! 19 years of serving my ass ! Same two people that were waiting to be sat we're still waiting to be sent when I came back to get the rest of my food and they ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Never again! We decided earlier in the evening that breakfast for dinner sounded like a plan. We chose Dennys. We walked in and our skin started crawling immediately. The floor was covered with trash throughout the dining room. There were tables covered with used plates and spilled food that looked like it has been there a while. The waitress immediately started apologizing and explaining that her waitresses were not doing their jobs. She walked us to one of the dirty tables and left us standing while she went to get a cloth to wipe down the table.   We decided to leave. If the dining room was that gross, what did the kitchen look like? As I said...never again!"}
{"text":"Was very hungry when I got here it took them 45 minutes to get the food to us and then when the food got to the table they didn't have everybody in the party's food and my food was horrible"}
{"text":"Service at this restaurant  is TERRIBLE. My roomate and I walked in and our server didn't even greet us.  No hello welcome to Dennys. Nothing. He glared at us and asked how many in our party then turned around and started to ask the lady at the cash register if she's going to take a break. Then another server came up and tried to seat us. So we stood there confused before we were finally led to our table. Our server threw the menus on the table and walked away. No \"hi my name is ___ I'll be your server. Nothing. We waited 10 minutes before another server noticed us and then took our drink order. Then it was another 10 minutes before our server took our order. The food was okay. I had a plate of nachos. The chips were burned. The meat was gross. My roomate had spegetti and meatballs. He says they were pretty good. I will never eat at Dennys again.  I've had two bad experiences."}
{"text":"Went with co-workers yesterday here for lunch. I'll cut to the chase. I ordered my sandwich on 7 grain toasted bread. I got sourdough. I had to physically hunt down other servers for refills on my drink. (Our waitress disappeared after bringing out our food). The service wasn't very good and my order was wrong. I tipped her 20% because she looked like she needed the money, but I will not recommend and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Met an old friend for lunch here today. Place was super busy and packed with way too many screaming toddlers. Wait for a table exceeded 15 minutes. Finally seated at a booth with no \"set up\" (silverware and napkins) but they did take our drink order right away, and were pretty quick to take food order too. I ordered extra mayo on the side because most restaurants never put enough mayo on my BLT's to suit me. When waitress finally brought food had to ask for \"set up\" and soda refill. No extra mayo on the side. She said, \"they put extra on it for you.\" Uh....no they didn't, she just realized when she got the order out to me, they forgot. I said, \"I'd like some extra mayo please\" and I guess this put her out. I get that Sundays are busy and I'm sure she had run herself ragged. However, bring me what I order please. You're not paying for it, I am. And, when I sit down, I shouldn't have to ask for utensils to eat with when the food arrives. That should already be there from the person who cleaned the table off. I think management in this particular Denny's needs an overhaul, and maybe some of the stations need to be broken down into smaller zones. I think service would improve. At least one can hope. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Please beware if you suffer from tree nut allergies as we were informed by the assistant manager (female) that there is a separate nut-free grill.  But then the general manager informed us, thanks to our vigilant waiter, that there is no separate grill and that cross-contamination is a big issue.  As my older nephew has a severe allergy, this was a pretty scary close call."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in for a midnight breakfast last night. Three was only three women paying at the counter when we walked in so we knew the wait was short. After all, it doesn't take long to pay right? After listening to the cashier shoot the breeze with these women for about ten minutes my son asked her if we could seat ourselves, she said no, sit over there and pointed to the benches. After a couple more minutes I asked for the manager. Just then another server came up and the girl at the register told her \"don't let these two guys in.\" Just then the manager came up, Was very polite and seated us. We explained what happen and then we ordered. Both of our short stacks of pancakes were Luke warm at best as was my meal.  Never again will I frequent this Dennys location."}
{"text":"Our server Jenna was very friendly and attentive. The manager on duty, Savannah, seemed extremely rude. She was yelling and ranting at her servers from across the restaurant in front of customers. Very unprofessional! Food came out very quickly and correctly which was awesome."}
{"text":"To quote the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons...\"Worst...Place...Ever!\"  We were the only ones in this place after midnight and 3 out of the 6 orders were messed up.  Seriously, who orders two different orders of eggs on the same plate?  From there it just got worse. The manager suddenly lost all compression of the English language when we told him that two of the plates were cold...one of my friends actually squeezed grease out of her eggs and hash browns...common sense would tell most people to just go ahead and comp the entire ticket if everyone at the table is not satisfied with the food and service provided.  If you see a person outside this Dennys with a sign warning people to turn around,  it will be me exercising my freedom of speech...If you value your stomach and your sanity, stay away from this place!  If I could give negative stars, this Dennys would have at least 5...."}
{"text":"Below average Dennys.  My toast was weird.  Thin and crunchy almost cracker like.  Food was slow to arrive and it wasn't busy.  was never offered a refill on my drink.  Food was ok.  Nothing great.  Other Dennys are way better"}
{"text":"Denny's always available after the club! Cheep food and service! It's what's for breakfast at 230 I'm the morning!!"}
{"text":"Love going here late at night. But the most recent visit was thw night before Halloween. And around 3 am the place was full of drunk college kids. The table behind me actually puked on their table and ran out of the restaurant. Employees left it there for about 10 minutes before cleaning it up. The smell and the visual spoiled the majority of my party's appetite. Service slow usually and eggs always underdone. But a reliable late night breakfast."}
{"text":"Denny's is located half a block away from the Longhorn Hotel & Casino.I ate here on my second morning in Las Vegas. Eating alone has its benefits: Peace and quiet while eating. The waitress I got was nice. I left her a tip when I paid upfront."}
{"text":"A true classic. Whilethe food is borderline horrible, the late night ambiance is unparalleled. At 3 am, you just never know who will be walking thru those doors...or what's going on in the bathroom. The crane game is rigged -- but a total blast when leaving. The wait staff makes this place. From aspiring pirates to old war vets, the staff will no doubt make your stay worthwhile. Always smiling....and pleasantly rude at the same time."}
{"text":"Make sure Rhonda is your waitress. She is really great and helpful. My brother and I are kind of a handful even though we are in our mid-twenties. Rhonda had a ton of patience and made great suggestions when I was being obnoxious about my order. Thanks, Rhonda!"}
{"text":"It's Denny's...they're open 24/7 which is convenient when you're trying to sober up after a night out on Fremont St. But then again, it's Denny's, which means for the price you're paying you're going to get medicore food. Don't get me wrong, I love breakfast and diner food, but Denny's just isn't as good as other places. Kudos for decent service even at 3 am when they have limited staff on hand."}
{"text":"Best customer service.. I've been to many Denny's by far this one is the best. Manager went out of her way for ice coffee made to the order. Service wast great!"}
{"text":"Ever been to a Denny's at 5:30AM on a Thursday?    I have.  It's strange.  Whether it's the long road trucker loading up on coffee, the random lady sleeping a booth, or creepy guy giving me creepy eye from a couple of booths over, the atmosphere strikes you as a little off.  But hey, it's Denny's.  What do you expect?  For the food, well, again, it's Denny's.  It's not horrible.  Breakfast options are common, plentiful, and delicious.  The coffee will be topped off regularly and you'll be 6 cups in before you know it.    The rest of the offerings are typically anything from deep-fried somethingorother to a \"fit menu\" offering that usually is a little short on taste.  So it's not a bad place.  It's a good place for kids, and you won't leave disappointed.  Just so long as creepy guy isn't there."}
{"text":"So I ordered my eggs sunnyside up and wife orders over medium and we had to switch plates.... my sunnyside up was more done than her over medium. Food was like warm at best. Ordered pancakes and French toast and had to wait on server to ask if everything was ok before we could get syrup..... probably not a repeater....."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in there was no one at front reception to welcome is or seat us plus we waited quietly some time with no one coming to our attention. Every employee's attention to us waiting at the front reception was abysmal. After finally being noticed and seated the waitress seemed very new and confused about where to seat us because she ain't know the table numbers. Where she seated us the table was dirty and had to stand there and wait again until the table was cleaned which should have been done before we were seated plus the floor looked like it hasn't been swept at all, the place wasn't even that busy. As far as the food I ordered the sausage supreme skillet which was pretty good and filling; they had a really good build your own skillet which I wish I took advantage of but just not in this location. Hopefully I can get better service and a better experience at another location. I not gonna just write the brand off just yet because of this set back at one location."}
{"text":"My family and I stumbled across a flat tire due to the construction going on close by so we parked at this Dennys. I was ready to change the tire but had no tire iron to remove the bolts. I fell in to ask if anyone had a 4way or tire iron and the gentleman Bri, was unable to because he used public transportation. He directed me to a phenomenal spirit named Joaquin, who didn't have one but insisted we use his triple A to have them change the tire. I had my squad fall in to eat and less than 15 minutes in, a yellow hhr shows up n helps us. Be not discouraged by the challenges people. Food was on point and showed up quick too. We had the Nachos"}
{"text":"Ok so I didn't know this place was associated with DICKS last resort! Damn the the hostess was rude, she grab up the menus and started walking away with out saying anything like follow me to your table."}
{"text":"I have been to this Denny's many ,many times over the years. It is close and easy to go to. It is your standard Denny's. The coffee is so so , the staff works hard ,and the food is doable. It has always seemed to be very clean,even the restrooms. There is lots of parking in the lot. The place is always packed,at least most times of the day. Except mid afternoon, that is a much calmer time of day here.  Food is very inexspensive so it is always a deal. It is right off the freeway as well, which makes it most convienant for all."}
{"text":"Can't beat the free bd grand slam!"}
{"text":"This Denny's is the worst location I have ever visited, let's start off by the wait time. My husband and I got seated immediately but it took them 30-45min to even acknowledge us. We hadn't been greeted by any waitress/waiter, until I basically had to yell at one of them to attend to us. I understand they are always busy but from my observation the staff seems like they are over there heads and don't know how to manage they're time or customers. I'm definitely a patient person but man this really tested it. Completely ridiculous, food was delicious but the service was completely unacceptable. Even observing other interactions, every customer seemed highly upset. The sign out doors says hiring new manager, I can definitely see why. They just need to completely hire a new staff. Will never return to this location. Oh and I also for got when we were being rung up the guy just charged us without even the transaction being completed HE WALKED AWAY WITH THE REGISTER STILL OPEN AND HE DIDNT EVEN HAD US THE RECEIPT"}
{"text":"Heat!!!No heat for a week are you joking! Been here numerous times and dealt with the normal dennys issues like speed, temp of food, and attitude of servers. But to have to eat in the cold, youre crazy! First Watch just opened near by, bet its warm there."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible. The waitress was great but we got cold food. Waited an hour for food"}
{"text":"I got to Denny's on Scottsdale rd and Mayo Blvd on April 5, 2018 at 7:00pm. Me and my friend were waiting to be seated for 20 minutes and there was nobody else waiting and only about 10 people in the restaurant. As being seated i made the girl aware that we have been waiting for longer than we should have, she than stops looks back and gives me the nastiest look. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"This location is  consistently poor with their service. My boyfriend and I visited late one night after I got off work. It was almost empty, maybe 4 people total. It took TEN MINUTES for them to seat us!!! And workers even acknowledged us, but just walked right past us several times. Then one lady stopped and asked if we needed a seat.. Um,,, no I would like to stand and eat please...? THEN! we ordered drinks. Each of us a coffee and a glass of water. the drinks took way too long and the coffee was horrible no matter how much sweetener/creamer i added, not to mention, it was not hot. The waitress asked for our order and asked if i wanted my fries seasoned. So i said sure, she didnt tell me it was an additional charge.... Also, when our food came out, my burger was not hot and my date said his sandwich was disgusting, neither of us finished our meals. Our waiter rarely checked on us. I had to go get ketchup from their little podium stand by myself.  On a separate occasion, I came here with my bf and another couple after a double date to Glendale Glitters. We ordered a BBQ burger of some sort and there was barely any sauce on it. I had to ask for more. THEN, my bf accidentally spiled a drink and when my waitress saw, she rolled her eyes and gave another table their food. We asked for napkins so we could clean it up so she didnt have to, and she gave us like 3 napkins to clean up a huge spill... like thanks. She was rude and not friendly at all and we were nothing but polite to her. Yes it was late and Im sure she was tired, but that doesnt permit eye rolling and rudeness.   I avoid this place whenever possible."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  My first trip to Ohio brought me here for breakfast and it gave me a great first impression for the great City of Highland Heights and the beautiful state of Ohio.  This is my new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I'm generally not a chain restaurant person (especially Denny's) but I have to give credit where credit is due! My husband and I went to this Denny's on 2/14.  The server we had that morning was one of the nicest, friendliest and genuine people ever to bring me food!  I really wish I had caught her name.  I ordered a vegetarian scramble-thingy that was supposed to include spinach.  Apparently the kitchen was out so she made sure they put in extra broccoli (after checking with me first).  She refilled our coffee the right amount of times (never 2 seconds after the first sip-- you know- when you finally get the balance of sugar/cream perfect).   The food was fine, but the service really stood out as top notch!!  I almost want to go back another weekday morning just to find out her name and give her the props she deserves.  *I made sure to tip well OVER 20%  :)"}
{"text":"I'm currently grossed out as I write this,, I've been unable to hold down food lately and just wanted a plain grilled cheese sandwich, I stopped at Denny's knowing that they have cheese and bread so it shouldn't be that much of a challenge, after asking if I could move from the bar top (where I had to smell and see all the food that was being prepared) to a booth and waiting 15 min for them to wipe it, my food finally arrived, I mentioned to the server that I think she gave me the wrong food, she said \" no, you wanted a grilled cheese and that's the closest we have\" it was a grilled cheese with fried cheese sticks stuffed in it, as you can imagine, fried food isn't going to digest well, so I pulled out the fried cheese and tried to eat the sandwich, as little bugs swarmed my meal, I finally just asked for my check. The cashier/manager asked if everything was ok, I said no and explained why, he said next time I'm in the area he'd discount my food. Gee thanks!!!! Maybe ask if a fried cheese sandwich is ok with a guest before assuming!"}
{"text":"Service was very poor. We ask the waiter and manager all together a total of 4 times just to get a straw. That's not including other items we ask for. My husband found a hair in his water. I later found a hair in my egg whites. I asked to speak with the manager, still waited 5 mins til she came to see us. She didn't charge my meal however, service was still very poor. They stated they were short staff however I personally feel that there should be no hair in the food! But if you're into that thing and want to take a chance well than this dennys is the place to be."}
{"text":"My Parent and I drove in from California yesterday and stopped in to grab a bite to eat.  This had to have been one of the best Dennys I had been to and the customer service was simply awesome!  The facility was clean, emaculate, and nicely decorated.  Our waiter was just simply the best!"}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I slept in a little bit Saturday morning but we still wanted breakfast.  Problem is that Las Vegas kind of stops having breakfast after 11 am, and we really didn't want to spend a lot of money.  As a result, we visited this location.  I had seen this location as we traveled a little away from the main strip over to the New Orleans to visit family staying there.  If you can get past the location and outside appearance, then a visit here provides great food, friendly prices, and breakfast anytime!  The customer service was very good!  The food was outstanding!  We had no issues!  My only recommendation, please keep your bathroom clean..."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised at how good the meal was.  Some of these chain style restaurants are hit and miss but this time everything was good.  We were seated fast, the service was very good and attentive.  The food arrived in a timely fashion, and the presentation was what we expected.  My son had the special with the pancakes in the shape of a reindeer with bacon antlers, and i had the eggs benny, and both of us were very happy with our choices.  Best of all they kept my coffee cup full.  If they can keep up this level of service i would be happy to return.  Oh and good job on those Reindeer pancakes, they looked just like the advertised picture."}
{"text":"I usually come here between the times of 11pm and 3am. Great service for a place that is open 24hrs. Employees are always welcoming. Very recently they have taken all their peanut butter items off their menu. No big deal at all considering many allergies are present. They have added new menu items that are nice and fresh! Such as my strawberries and cream pancakes"}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Waited over one hour for our meal. My food was lukewarm and I froze  my butt off waiting to eat. It's like they put the air conditioning on full blast so that you won't stay long, however if they simply got the food and drinks out quickly people could leave faster! Their whole process is a joke! Dennys needs to start hiring people who care about serving and hospitality, otherwise change the theme from \"family friendly\" to \"ass holes  on purpose\" so that people know what their getting when they walk in the door!"}
{"text":"It's a kool spot I guess.. But I've been going there for a few yrs now and the staff is great but the food is good at best but not great and this place is slowly getting worse.. Bathrooms are never clean if you show up at 7am but wish them well but I've given more than enough money to this place and its not getting better.. Sorry guys"}
{"text":"Sad, sad, sad. We went two weeks ago to try the new pancakes and they were great and service was good. Two weeks later, pancakes were horrible, eggs were cold. Something really gross was floating in my refill of coffee that took forever to get. The negative comments are on point, service is inconsistent. Won't be back and can not recommend it."}
{"text":"Not for breakfast.... Everything was over cooked...even the toast broke into two pieces just like the brittle over cooked bacon.  Disappointed this visit."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this Denny's for awhile now. They did remodel which looks more modern.   On your birthday you get a free grand slam. Also kids eat free on Tuesdays from 4pm-10pm with a purchase of an adult entree.   They have breakfast, lunch & dinner options available. I love their chicken noodle soup & broccoli cheese soups. Chicken noddle soup is served everyday. Along with a different soup of the day. Their mozzarella sticks are good. Also their burgers I like. You can ask for season fries, it's a couple extra cents more but taste better."}
{"text":"My husband and I live quite close to this restaurant. We've visited a few times when we haven't been up to making dinner and it's always a good experience. The servers care about you and your business and it really shows. I will most definitely revisit this location again and again."}
{"text":"Came back today for another Original Grand Slam because of their anniversary promotion. The bacon and sausage were cooked from frozen so there was no problem there but the eggs were disappointing. I ordered my eggs scrambled this time instead of poached and they came out tough and cold. The pancakes were alright - not the fluffiest but not a bad texture either."}
{"text":"This particular location before when we used to come, they used to serve amazing hot coco, now they only serve coco flavoured hot water basically, rest food was quite decent, Hush puppies are bomb though. Taste super good. Servers are good."}
{"text":"Nothing was represented like in the pictures, kids ate a little bit of the food, my husband and I couldn't eat ours . We had to stop by at another restaurant to grab some sandwiches on the way back to the hotel. Service was horrible you have to ask for everything,  lots of homeless people in the area, one tried to use the restroom and the staff got into a public altercation."}
{"text":"The food is fine.  Classic Denny's food and quality, The staff are nice. It is, however, the worst managed Denny's I have ever been in.  We live nearby and were happy there was a local, very nice looking Denny's.  After several meals there, we're about to give up.  You wait forever to be seated - today, with an almost empty restaurant and 6+ wait staff, it was because all the tables were dirty.  The waiter rapidly wiped off the table and tossed the rag to the next dirty table.  I took photos of the dirty tables and tray full of dirty dishes that stayed right by us throughout our meal.  The wait staff appear to be untrained. No one cleans table; the wait staff run around empty handed, never picking up a dirty dish.  Where's the manager?      Whoever owns this particular Denny's - get yourself an experienced manager who knows how to assign sections to wait staff; get a bus boy and keep the tables ready for customers."}
{"text":"This is a very busy Denny's.  Seems like they put to many tables in there so they want refuse service.  Everyone knows how Denny's food taste.  It's the same across the board.  I do especially love the holidays at Denny's because they always have the holiday flavored. Pumpkin spice coffee. It's a treat to me because I do not drink coffee."}
{"text":"Service was bad. Food took forever then server forgot many items in our order. Pancakes tasted strange. This place is a no-go."}
{"text":"I didn't like the face that 2 people walk in and said that they needed a table of 10. The host waited for the rest of the party to walk in which took them 5 minutes to walk in. The host could of helped me for a party of 1. Since I had to wait,  I walked out and went to McDonald's."}
{"text":"We went to Denny's late last night and while standing in the waiting area the waitress came up and abruptly said \"there's a 40 minute wait for food\". I asked, even deserts? She said just a minute and went into the back. She came back out and motioned for us to follow her. We were seated and both ordered coffee as we looked at the menu. We asked her for the molten chocolate lava cake and apple caramel deserts. She said they were out of the lava cake, so we said we'll have the cheesecake instead. She came back a couple minutes later and said they are also out of the apple caramel desert. So we said we'll just take the bill for the coffee. We have liked this Denny's before but this time the waitress was just plain rude which we were willing to look past but then to not have either of the deserts we chose made this a bad trip to Denny's. You would have thought they would have comp'd the coffee since they were out of what we ordered but we paid full price.  Very Disappointed customers!"}
{"text":"It's Easter and not much is open.  So we went to dennys for burgers with a side salad.  The burgers are really good for the money.  About $11 for a bacon or mushroom burger with a side salad.  The meat is fresh  and tasty. We ate it in no time.  The side salad was huge but I'm not such a fan of icebueg lettuce.  The service was fast.  This is a great Denny's."}
{"text":"This Denny's is a good spot to meet with your friends. They're open 24 Hours and centrally located, without having to deal with strip traffic. The food quality isn't the best, it is Denny's after all, but I gave them 4 Stars because they do well at delivering what they set out to. They have a menu with everything. They are simple and can put together anything. The staff has always been polite the number of times I have gone there, and the neighborhoods not bad."}
{"text":"After trying to find decent nachos on the Las Vegas strip and failing miserably, we finally settled for Denny's and were pleasantly surprised for $9 to get this whopping plate and with REAL cheese and ingredients. Compare this to $18 nachos on the strip that were horrid with fake lumpy cheese sauce, I have no complaints about the food here at this Dennys.  This Dennys looks new and was nice and clean inside. Service from our waiter, Shane, was fabulous. He was on top of refills like nobody's business. Constantly checked on us without being annoying or pushy, and extremely friendly guy. Wish all the waiters were like him!"}
{"text":"Over an hour for a simple $8 breakfast. 20 min from seating to order placed, another 25-30 before food arrived. It's not that hard, guys. They did comp our $8.64 check after we complained... twice."}
{"text":"This Denny's is right near the Tahiti Village Resort on Las Vegas Boulevard. It is very close to car rental return and the outlet mall. It is a great place for breakfast or late dinner. This must be the friendliest waitstaff I've ever encountered at a Denny's restaurant. Restaurant is clean, the food is good, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone down hill. So sad because it's not the food or prices but the customer service.  I've come here five times since my original review and every time yet manager to mess up my to go orders. If all ahead of time so it shouldn't be a problem. No pressure. Wrong. Busy or not they mess up either big or tiny things. 1. Missing an entire meal (on multiple occasions) 2. Three orders of their Pancakes (no syrup, butter or silverware) 3. Ordering a quesadilla with no pico de gallo and instead it has EXTRA. Enough is just enough. They make it right, but at my expense of having to drive all the way back and just makin excuses. Once In a whole okay, but every single time is ridiculous. Im over it and won't be back"}
{"text":"So my mom and I are here and what Horrible service! Our waitress is Desirea.  Someone just left without paying the bill. To start off I ordered the mozzarella cheese with extra sauce. I also asked for extra napkins. we didn't have forks and knives so I got up and got it for us. So Desirea brings the cheese sticks without the extra sauce so I thought she went to get it but she never came back. So now my cheese sticks are getting cold so when have to get the manager so I can get my extra sauce or I wouldn't have got it. Then my mom orders a salad and it's not how she ordered it. Not only is she extremely slow but it's not very busy even. Thank goodness it's not busy she wouldn't be able to handle it. It took Desirea over 20 minutes to check on us after the corrections were done, no im sorry. What a Sorry Dennys. I say don't even bother. This place doesn't even deserve a star!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this with multiple bad experiences at this Denny's location but I've had enough. Never coming back! This experience happened Halloween it was not even that busy. The floors were disgusting my booth was not cleaned properly and then I needed a high chair for my son... it was filthy! I'm so glad he didn't get sick from sitting in that! Server was nice but we waited awhile for our food and I got the pumpkin pancakes and they looked NOTHING like they do in the picture or on the commercials and they were NASTY! There was none of that cream stuff they put on top on my pancakes. I also asked for crispy bacon, it was not crispy! It was just overall gross and this is not the first time this has happened at this location this is maybe the 4th time and I've had enough! It was way too filthy inside I felt gross and uncomfortable just sitting there! That alone made me want to never go back the food being horrible just topped it off! Don't eat here and if you have kids do not use their high chairs!"}
{"text":"Pamela gave such amazing service and the food is always amazing! This new location is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Took 15 min during lunch on Sunday for someone to serve us after having to ask the hostess for a waitress and she didn't even properly confirm my allergy. Yelled it across 3 tables while serving other customers and was pretty rude about it. Left the place. Parking is free but was almost not found"}
{"text":"Food and experience was just ok.  Service was ok.  I really miss Perkins (from the east coast)."}
{"text":"Thank you Diana, get service ! Nice and clean restaurant . very quite and laid back atmosphere! Food was yummy, place is clean, everyone is friendly.  I also pick up good to go, very fast, gets out in less than 20 mins"}
{"text":"On my way out of town for a day trip, I stopped at this Denny's in Chandler because it looked less busy than the nearby IHOP (I'm being honest). I was pleasantly surprised by the service and the food at this location. I was happy that I did stop in on that busy Saturday morning.   Upon entering, I sat at the stool area up front and was immediately given a menu. The gals working there were all friendly and very quick with their service. I was given a juice and coffee and my order was taken within 5 minutes.   When the food came out, it looked good. The eggs were right and the french toast looked perfect as well. Overall, I found my breakfast there to be one of the better breakfasts I've ever experienced at a Denny's.   I'm glad IHOP was busy that day as I got to receive good service and food at this Denny's. I really appreciated the timelines of their work in terms of taking orders and getting food out to customers as well.   4-stars overall!"}
{"text":"This location is a bad example of a Denny's! March 10, 2017 we're a group of 3. We ordered simple stuff. The wait-time was unacceptable, our waitress was running around doing the best she can, in an understaffed situation. She updated us, apologized numerous times. The food was basically alright. The eggs my daughter got seemed undercooked. I ordered pancake poppers in advance to appear with the check... Nope. She didn't charge for it. NOT sure what has happened, but the owners need to get things running smoothly. This is #LasVegas and people expect more. This was a super disappointment. I usually love Denny's and all the staff. Today was, as they say: a hot damn mess."}
{"text":"Overall a bad experience. Never coming back to this location. I understand it's Father's Day & it's going to be busy, no problem. Only waited about 15 minutes for a table- not bad at all. The guy who was hosting (with a ponytail) did a great job with the volume and getting people in/ out as quickly as possible and was very friendly. Carla S. greeted us within a reasonable amount of time and got our drink orders; shortly after that took our food orders. My food was good, but my boyfriend's food was inedible. He maybe took 3 bites & left the rest.   We knew it was going to be busy before we even got there & had absolutely no problem being patient and waiting (we get it). However, it wasn't until 3 tables that were sat AFTER us got their food BEFORE us, that it became an issue. Another server who was helping a table next to ours saw we had been waiting for water refills for about 20 minutes and came over to check on us. Not sure what her name was (red/orange hair in a bun on the top of her head) but she took the time to fill our waters and even check up on us later. We really appreciated that !  Carla had checked on her other tables and walked past ours about 5 times before she even came to check on us (probably only because the other server said something). I tried to get her attention but she didn't even make eye contact with us, it's like we weren't even there or weren't her problem. Not sure if it was because she thought we weren't going to tip her well or if she actually just forgot about us?! Either way, simply just acknowledging us would've gone a long way Carla. I'm a server and I don't mind waiting when it's busy or if there is a mishap in the kitchen, but it seemed like you just completely forgot about us or didn't care. Even if it did slip your mind & you forgot to put our food in, that's ok- just let us know!! It was more frustrating watching 3 tables who got sat after us get their food before us and us not even being acknowledged."}
{"text":"Needs help! I've been to this place a few times and it seems like this dennys is on its way down like the one on Tropicana and Decatur.. Step it up please"}
{"text":"Horrible service! No check backs on how things were, drinks took forever to be brought to the table after we ordered, had to ask for refills, and it took forever for our server to drop the check after we had already asked for it. She checked on other tables several times and didn't check on us. Wtf?!?! Get your shit together, Denny's!!!"}
{"text":"my waitress Cindy was really nice and funny. She was always so smiley and didnt look at all bothered even when it was busy and my skilet was really good"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Absolutely worst service I have ever had in my entire life. We sat down and the lady could not be bothered. From the moment we walked in it was like we were a bother to the waitress. She asked for our drinks and didn't return for another 20 minutes to ask for our orders. We ordered and it took another 45 minutes to receive our food, which would be acceptable if they were slammed but they weren't. 2 other tables received their food before we did and we arrived well before them. During the time we waited our waitress NEVER asked how we were doing or if we needed refills on our drinks. We finally received our food ( our order was not correct). And she dropped off the food and never  asked if it looked correct, literally dropped off the food in the middle of the table and left. She was rude to our guest and said \"excuse me\" in a incredibly rude manner as if he was in the way and had him move his drink and silverware. (Again we felt as if we were inconveniencing her)... speaking of silverware we received our food after 45-60 minutes of waiting and by this time we were starving and still had to ask for silverware... when we finished we paid our bill and asked to speak to a manager. The manager replied \" I will get to them when I get time.\" We wanted to offer some feedback and waited and the manager never came out.... we tend to be very understanding but this was by far the worst service we have ever had in our lives... it made McDonalds looks like a 5 star restaurant... please for the love of everything do not go here. PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS DENNYS LOCATION!!!!!"}
{"text":"Rhonda our waitress was excellent. She was there when we needed her & the refills would come without asking for them. Great service & beyond friendly with such a great attitude. Food came out great & fast. Best Denny's I've been to in a long time"}
{"text":"What can I say about this experience?  Well I cannot fault our server Scott.  Honestly aside from a cook he was the only person working.  He was cleaning, waiting tables,  cashier, host, and busting his ass.  Seriously there was no one else working.  The food was decent for a Denny's.  It was a quick place to stop with the family on our way home from tubing the Salt River.  Honestly please support Scott is you stop here.  We probably will not be back.  Prices seemed higher than other Denny's.  Maybe it is because of the college near by.  Stop if you want.  It is only a Denny's but not a good one  even by Denny's standards."}
{"text":"I've never really had a bad meal here. It's Dennys though so you know what you're getting.  I find the breakfasts are good tasting and filling. They have plenty of pancake specials and toasty hot coffee. Good sammiches for lunch and a decent assortment for dinner. Find a coupon which they have plenty of in flyers or email club and tie your feed bag on. Just remember you need to print all of their email coupons which is an antiquated system."}
{"text":"Worst night to have chosen Dennys. They didn't prepare for the 5k Foam Run right down the street. We arrived before most of the crowd and still waited 36 mins for a table. 8 empty tables and an empty Phoenix room  so this seems ridiculous. Soon people poured in and a young host couldn't remember who came first or how many in the party. The shift supervisor Charlotte emerged 30 minutes after we did and was fairly ill Prepared to manage her staff! Once seated it was 23 minutes before anyone addressed our drink needs. We ordered and I am still here 58 minutes since he ordered nachos as an appetizer and cheeseburger. Haven't been offered a refill and a waitress sloshed a drink on my shoulder and table then dropped a cup of ice and used drink on the floor and soaked my purse and leg. I am too annoyed to report food quality as at  this point I am not convince I am getting any. Charlotte should be ashamed of herself as her staff are running wildly out of control and with some direction might actually serve some cu"}
{"text":"I was at Denny's 6/27 (Tues around 930 am) when I came up to their parking lot, their planter box got in the way as they did NOT have a branch standing up to let people know there is something there before a person pulls up to the other side of the lot. The car on the right was in the way where I couldn't tell there were a planters box there. After I realized I was trying to go through it, I heard crunch sound to my right side tire. I backed out and stopped the car went out to see and noticed there were some scratches on the tires but couldn't tell what it looked like underneath the car. I told Nicole twice before I left to let her supervisor know of this to have some warning signs or something so it won't happen to other people's car. The next day, I called Denny's to speak with manager, Marie. She said she didn't get the message from Nicole but maybe she gave it to her direct manager. Marie referred me to Breanna Wilhelm regarding the landscape of the responsibility. I called Breanna on it and she was very nice about it said for me to take photos since I told her I was taking it to a mechanic on 6/29. I took photos and sent it to Breanna 6/30 and now she came to let me know they are not responsible for the scratches as I sent her photos of it. I called back to Denny's on Warm Springs to speak to Marie but a Chris, not so good CS, said Marie is not there so I left her a message. The problem is why I was given run around or someone did not want to take the responsibility for the actions. Now I'm awaiting from Marie to get back to me or else will go to Corporate. I also want to mention their sausage link was a bit too greasy. And why is it Denny's been around for ages, they get better dishes to serve intead of white old dishes?"}
{"text":"This place is awful! The sewer smell is beyond disgusting as you walk in and the food is even worse. We all got sick after eating here! Just walk over to shake shack! The coffee was the only decent thing about this place."}
{"text":"We waited over one and a half hours for our food and the food was freezing cold by the time it got to us. And to make matters worse the manager acted like we were stupid when we complained. Worst service ever!"}
{"text":"Classic good breakfast and Edwin was a great server.  Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I were leary of this restaurant, seeing a 3 star rating. Now, we see why. Pancakes were cold and tough, grits had no flavor, portion size was on the small side. Honestly, we won't ever be back to this restaurant. Horrible."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week, the service is fantastic. And we have noticed that the quality of the food has improved over this past year. Kudos to the management for the improvements. I have been having the steak lately and it needs so sauces, it's tender and seasoned just right. We go on different days so when I have dinner it's not the same cook. Lunchtime and breakfast can be busy, however they do their best to seat you. The servers are attentive and very pleasant.   My one pet peeve is the clean up. When you have sections that are empty it's fine to sweep up, however when people are seated and eating sweeping at their table is unacceptable! Dust flies and right beside my table or almost under it is a no no in my book."}
{"text":"It's Denny's! Got a grilled cheese with bacon. Perfect late night snack. It's not fine dining but super convenient since we were staying at the Tahiti Village and just walked across the parking lot! Extra star for that."}
{"text":"I am going to try and locate the manager and let him know that his front host/hostess staff is horrible.  I came in and waited while 2 people stood at the cash register and neither one of them ackowledged my presence.  Then they switched places and still .....nothing....  How rude can you be?  If it wasn't for the great waitress and the food was good, I would give this location 1 star.  I go to most Dennys around the valley after hiking and they are always pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, Jason at this Denny's took care of what we needed. Also if you are here around 8PM and 9PM - take seats closed to Mirage (if weather permits, go into patio) - and have a spectacular show."}
{"text":"I love Denny's food and ever changing menu, however, this particular location is too small! It's always crowded and the seating is tight."}
{"text":"Food was good but they seriously need more staff.Two waiters running around like their hair was on fire!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a full breakfast with the family.. Everything was great..  Our waitress Alicia,  who said she  was a trainee,  was exceptional.."}
{"text":"I felt like giving 3-4 stars to Denny's because my breakfast was very enjoyable.  Soup was great and I was enjoying breakfast on my business trip.  I wanted to eat something healthier so I ordered salad however tomatoes turned out to be bad.  Some were ok however others rotten already.   I'm surprised they served me that salad, it's so easy to see if produce is fresh or not.      So first I was enjoying breakfast but after I noticed how bad tomatoes were I didn't enjoy breakfast as much thinking to my self I wonder how fresh is the rest of the food.    I did show tomatoes to my server.  She told me that she showed that to manager.    Rotten fresh produce is not exactable.. Come on guys ... You should of offer free breakfast at least..."}

{"text":"I took a friend of mine to Denny's that had never been and everything was excellent. I have always had breakfast regardless of the time of day. The service was quick and efficient and the food was superb!! My friend was very satisfied and full. The pancakes were fluffy, the jalape√±o bacon was crisp and the red skinned potatoes with carmelized onions were unforgettable!! I am already planning my next visit"}
{"text":"I have ordered here for pickup MANY times for myself and co-workers.  I am always the one to run down and get the food.  Never once have I had an issue with using different payments for each order.  I understand that a card might be stolen, but to flat out refuse to let me use 2 cards after all the times I have been in there with more is crazy.  There have been times when I came with as many as FOUR different cards to pay for orders.  If this is policy, EVERY employee should follow it and when I am placing separate orders on the phone, they should say something.  What if I did not have the money to pay for both orders on one card?  Also, they did not even check my ID, so how the hell would they know if the card I used was actually mine or not?!  Epic fail... guess I will choose Biscuits Cafe up the street next time.  #pissingoffyourregularsmightnotbethebestbusinessplan"}

{"text":"Denny's is the same the USA over.  But here on the Las Vegas strip Denny's is a friendly welcome back to reality.  Good food, excellent breakfast at normal everyday prices, not prices jacked up 3,000 percent simply because your in Las Vegas.  Service was great as Pamela pampered us to ensure everything needed was provided."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast...my meal was only like 7.00...should of been 13.00...so i tipped 5.00....  Food tasted good it was around 5am..."}
{"text":"you ever went to a place and regretted going there? Well, this is one of those places.   As soon as I walked in, i felt an atmosphere like the life was being sucked out of me. I turned to look for the hostess, and there was no one. One person looked at me standing there, and like a zombie, she started to inch closer and closer to me. I don't know what it looks like to hate your job, but if I had to put my finger on it, she would be it.   After sitting down, I ordered a coffee and the fit slam (as per my pic). I started reading the news on my phone and started sipping my coffee. once the food arrived, I started eating. Once I finished my food want was finishing my coffee, I noticed something on the coffee mug. Either I put on lipstick this morning without knowing it or they gave me a dirty mug without me realizing it....Didn't feel very well after that. Asked for the bill and got out of there....Will not go back."}
{"text":"Not too happy with the service last night. Waitress was kind of mean to me when I asked about the wifi. I actually drove out of my way to go study there as well as have dinner and drink coffee. Once I found out the wifi was down and they weren't going to restart the wifi router or attempt to turn it on, I cancelled my order. I got the feeling that they intentionally turned off the wifi."}
{"text":"Being that it's my first time trying Denny's, I must say I'm dissatisfied. As we sat down to our table, waitress took 15 mins to even say hello to us. I ordered steak omelet and it came with Hashbrown. Hashbrown was sloppy, steak omelette was below average taste wise. Now my aunt also ordered the sausage skillet, it had absolutely NO taste!"}
{"text":"As little as you already expect from a chain diner someway somehow they still managed to disappoint me. Poor food was the biggest thing."}
{"text":"my favorite Denny's!! the weekday late night staff are awesome my ultimate omelette is always hot and delicious. also everyone is always very friendly and proficient."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was really slow. We had to wait to be seated for breakfast we had to wait for somebody to come take our order and then we had to wait for our food. Then we had to wait for somebody to come check us out. They had plenty of empty tables and empty booths."}
{"text":"Dirtiest Dennys I've ever been too, almost fell getting into the booth, which was covered in salt and what I believe was syrup. Waitress didn't bother to clean it up, even after seeing it dirty, I had to ask for extra napkins to clean the table. There was jelly stuck to the window!! There were only two waitress and one cook, restaurant half full, saw the waitress once when she took our order and at the end when she picked up our plates, didn't have anyone check in with us to see if we needed refills or how the food was. Waited about 4 minutes and no check, got up and waited a few more for someone to help us and ring us up. Never again going to this place."}
{"text":"This Denny's kept me alive my first two years at Case....but after eating here weekly (or more like nightly during finals week), and then leaving the meal plan behind, I swore off Denny's for good.   2 years later and I was craving some Denny's, or \"The Den\" as it has been rebranded. I was pleasantly surprised to see some major menu changes. Unfortunately, food was no where near as good as it looked/sounded. I should've known better and just let Denny's live in my fond memories.  Overall, if you need some late-night, cheap, and greasy food to fuel your studying, Denny's is still you best choice. Unfortunately, all the other students are thinking the same thing, and it can take a decent amount of time to get your food."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Horrible service both times. Weight staff was okay but everything took a year. It wasnt busy or anything. Today? Ordered my eggs over medium- came out so under cooked that the whites were hardly set in some places! My toast was squished flat. Why would you squish toast flat?! It took 15 minutes for replacement toast and ten minutes to get a refill. We've given this Denny's two chances and they've failed both. Save yourself and go to IHOP across the street."}
{"text":"Definitely improved service. Fast, efficient and attentive. Specializing in 10 minute tickets. Meaning you shouldn't have to wait long for your food. The waitress Kia in addition to presenting my bill said she would check back with me as well. Checkbacks are good customer service."}
{"text":"Much better service than last time. I'm going back to this Denny's.  The places looks great too after the remodel"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came in on a Sunday morning, which, I know, already sounds like it's a bad idea. We arrived around 10 and got told it was a 10-15 minute long wait so we decided to stay instead of leaving to find somewhere else. We ended up waiting with our infant child for about 30-40 minutes for a table. I get it your busy, I'm in the industry. Continuing on we got seated and waited for about 15 minutes before our waitress came around to take our drink order. I asked for creamer with my coffee and she brought plain, which may have been my fault for not specifying, not sure because any other time I've asked we've been brought the normal French vanilla and hazelnut. Well after she had dropped my plain black coffee off I waited until she had made her way around back to us before asking for flavored cream (the half and half sat on the table untouched). When she had come back around (15 more minutes later) I had asked for my creamer and my 10 month olds juice that I never received.  At that time we also placed an order (by this time it was 12:35, I checked). As we were waiting for her to make her way back with beverages I counted the number of tables in her section because homegirl looked like she was in the weeds and BELIEVE me I totally get it girl. Six table section. Four four top booths, one four top table, and a party of eight. By all means make that money, but at least have another server helping you out to check in on your section, since everyone else was walking about at a leisurely pace. Huge eye roll. By the time our food arrived (which was extremely fast, 12:46) she dropped everything on the table and and walked away. Well, here goes a few things. My boyfriends hash browns were cold. Not lukewarm but cold, nothing hot about them. His drink was gone, he was trying to wait for her to come back around to grab a water before he started eating, except she never came back around. So, he sat with cold hash browns, which he ended up eating because at this point I was irritated at the blatant lack of customer service, and he didn't want to make a scene. I sat with my cold coffee and dirty dishes (as there was 0 prebussing). By the time our server dropped our check it was about 1pm. Mind you we arrived at 10am. That's absolutely ridiculous. We might as well have gone for lunch, somewhere other than Denny's at that point. I would say I'm disappointed, except it's Denny's and I should know better than that. I'm just completely blown away by the lack of teamwork here. Don't give weak servers a strong section. End of story."}
{"text":"This Denny's is located downtown, has a bar, and it is beautiful!  It's modern with a hint of whimsy.Though the food is what you'd expect from any other Denny's, the atmosphere is not! Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is super clean. The food is super good. And the staff look tired from wait N on you hand and foot. When you come leave a tip they deserve it :)"}
{"text":"We've been sitting here for 45 minutes and still haven't even gotten our drinks this is ridiculous and the worst service I've ever had at a Denny's, this is located on the strip so it should be able to get food out fast and efficiently, haven't seen our waiter in 45 minutes"}
{"text":"Pretty much the worst Dennys in America. Worst service, gross environment, crappy management. I swear to god I mean it this time I won't waste my time coming back. Always something crappy about the experience. First server acted like I was inconveniencing her when I walked up to be seated, she threw the menus on the table and walked away without saying a word, she wasn't there to ask for boxes so had to ask another server more than once cuz I was I was ignored first time. Had to ask another server for more coffee after being out for a while. Manager was flirting with my server whole time while she was being that way course he didn't notice or say anything or do anything bout it. Server was really loud with ppl at table behind me while I and my daughter were ignored. Dump."}
{"text":"Service is really bad. I came at 10PM and no servers welcome me. Called too many times no one helps to order."}
{"text":"Upon sitting down I realized this place had 2 and half stars but stood anyways. First and foremost this place doesn't have enough servers. I seen countless customers get up and look for their servers and had mistakes made on my check as well. Management needs to take care of this ASAP. Our server Connor and was very polite and nice. I felt bad for him because he had a whole section for himself and seemed like there was a lot of workload on him with no help. Seemed that way for a lot of servers here. The workers are nice however some advice for management...........HIRE SOME MORE PEOPLE!!! Also when mistakes are made staff needs to take ownership rather that make excuses."}
{"text":"Me, my son and his friend are visiting from Orange county. And the closest place for us to eat was Denny's.  Shannon the Manager, saw that we had not been seated and grabbed us right away.  She grabbed water for our extreme thurst. Took our order, and got it right! Without writing anything down.  She had a Great!! Fantastic!! Personality. Actually the only person since we've been here that was so nice to us. Are food was served hot and delivered in less than 15 minutes.  However we came the next day for breakfast expecting the same service from our server Kay. All we received was fakeness and bad service. Overall the food was very delicious. Thanks Shannon the Manager for a Great! Experience."}
{"text":"Came to dennys after waking up starving. I had the country fried steak breakfast.  It was good. Waiter was ok. We did get seated right away which was good.  Overall had a great breakfast n a great time"}
{"text":"This is our local Denny's so we eat here probably 5 times a year for breakfast on the weekends. It's always busy for breakfast but they are really good about getiing you in and the food is always good. I've never had a problem here."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to this Denny's since I moved from Chandler five years ago. Close to the hospital for a lite bite after outpatient.   We were seated fairly quickly but our server took quite a while to come see us.    We ordered an All American Slam and coffee plus a Club Sandwich. No frills, just easy, American food. The bill came to $22.56. Really?  $11 each?  Service was very poor. The dude in the headband was full of 'I'll be right there' but we'd wait a while for him to return. He only had three other guests. My water never got refilled despite his two promises to fill it.   Sorry to see this Denny's lose the homey feel.  Prices were up (same everywhere tho) quality stayed level but with horrible service, you can't turn profits."}
{"text":"This restaurant has two stars I guess this review will not. Help that. Have not been to Denny's in at least 5 years  because of the poor service. This visit ordered a bowl of soup to-go for my wife with a sore tooth, the hostess handed a coffee cup of soup no bag no napkins and no spoon, when I asked for these items, I was told they had no spoons to-go."}
{"text":"Very nice meal and handy location. Recommend to all. Price is very good!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Big restaurant, great service and the place is clean. I go on a regular on Sunday's and I have never had any issues."}
{"text":"Denny's is always been a favorite places  easy cheep and  great service."}
{"text":"I came to this Denny's because it was the closest thing on the strip late at night while walking. We were seated pretty fast and at first everything seemed alright at first. The server came and took our order and overall the food didn't take too long. However, the server was not nice or attentive. Every time I wanted something he was no where to be found, he didn't check up on us at all. Later when he came and I asked him for 2 items he said, \"Anything else? So I don't have to keep going back and forth\"....talking about RUDE!!! But that was not all. As I was eating I saw a hair on my plate! Yes, a freaking hair, how disgusting is that!!?? I asked to speak to management and they removed it off my tab, pretty disgusting if you ask me. There should absolutely be no hair on anyone's food, it doesn't seem like the cook wears a hair net."}
{"text":"I wish they had a zero this Denny's is horrible the food sucks and the manager Kevin is even worse!! Stupid service nasty food!!!"}
{"text":"Food was blah. Nothing special. Kim our waitress brought her kids to work they were seated next to us. They screamed bloodly murder the entire time and every time they did she would go over to them. Your at work not at home. She never came over to check on us or anything more concern about her kids."}
{"text":"When in Vegas you go with the flow. I haven't eaten at Denny's in 20 years. My friends wanted Denny's, so I agreed to go. The waitress, Amy, was a ray of sunshine and very attentive. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and correctly took down all of our orders. The food arrived hot and our beverages were always full."}
{"text":"Placed the to-go order at 10:50.  Was told it'd be ready in 15 minutes. I walked out of Denny's at 11:33 with my refund right when manager walked up with my order. Not also did he not apologize or try to rectify the problem, he just opened the cash register and slapped cash on the counter and walked away... versus reversing the credit card transaction!  How impersonal & rude!   If I had known it'd take that long, I'd hit a drive thru on my way. Or sat down to eat!!!  I would have given 1 star but I could tell the cashier was getting agitated with their service and could tell if she could rectify the issue, she would have done so!"}
{"text":"FOOD: I had the Red White and Blue grand slam with blueberry pancakes which was yummy and a decent price.  Typical Denny's setup, but in a way felt nicer and newer inside than some other Denny's I've been to. Didn't take long at all just a couple minutes to be seated and food came out fast.   STAFF: Server was awesome he was funny and attentive and cheery for being so late at night with drunk people in the joint.  BATHROOM: Bathroom is in the very back and is available to customers even though sign in front door says no bathrooms but probably to ward off people from using the bathroom if they're not customers.   SECURITY/NO SLEEPING HERE: Security guard is here and told my friend he can't sleep since he had his head down on his arms on the table."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast, yet ridiculously satisfying after a night of drinking. Easy peasy food with friendly staff. My favorite hangover spot... I always leave feeling better."}
{"text":"The only place in very northern Phoenix that's open at 10pm on a Sunday night when I don't feel like cooking.  Dropped in here with my boy... it was so empty... poor server looked so bored and didn't appear excited to know she had all night pretty much by herself because there aren't many bars around to fill this place at 2am.  Needless to say, the service was great... a little too attentive tho.  Brought out our dessert before I was even done with my onion rings... it's like \"whoa... hold on... lemme finish this first.\"  Burger was pretty darn good though and of course, it's cheap."}
{"text":"Most people probably won't believe this but, this was my first time at Denny's. I've always wanted to go but never got a chance. A couple of girls from work and I went to get some dinner after work. As we got to the restaurant it was not too busy, so we got seated right away. The first thing we ordered was milkshakes. From what I have heard the milkshakes are really good. I got the Birthday Cake one and others got Oreo. The shakes were really good. The birthday one was a little sweeter than I thought but it tasted great. As for food I ordered the Peanut Butter flavored pancakes. I felt like the food was so much I couldn't even finish my food. The only reason why I rated it 4/5 is because of the service it was really slow despite the fact that it wasn't busy. They missed up our order twice but they were kind enough to fix it. First it was the side, we ordered fries but they gave us hash browns. Second we order 2 Oreo, 1 Birthday Cake shake but they brought 1 Oreo, 2 Birthday Cake. Overall, the food was really good, I would love to come back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"This has the typical good Denny's food but what make this exceptional are the very friendly people working there.  We had a meeting to get to and asked them before we got seated if they could get us our breakfast in time for us to leave at this certain time.  They made sure our food was given to us in ample time.  Like other Denny's, they accepted my AARP card for the discount but you have to ask for the discount since it was clearly posted anywhere."}
{"text":"Lovely location. Basically on a first name basis with the staff after eating here so often while i was pregnant. The food is always here quickly and taste great!"}
{"text":"I like Denny's! Their service is friendly, efficient and treated my group of friends kindly and unlike some restaurants that treat young people (we're in university/colleges, but many of us look like we are younger possibly) as inferiors due to our youth, we were treated respectfully and cordially. They were helpful in answering questions and got all our orders right. They checked in to ensure we enjoyed our food and gave us an extra pitcher of ice water which is nice of them to do. The food was standard for a diner, quite decent and for someone who understands that I am paying for what I'm getting, I can't complain. I liked the food. Nothing too outstanding but not mediocre either. I left Denny's with my friends with a good impression. As a lover of all-day breakfast, I would definitely come here again & recommend to fellow pancake loving, tea drinking, eggs and toast enthusiasts. Hip hip hooray for breakfast foods :) www.ariemacherie.tumblr.com"}
{"text":"Best service ever. Erick was our server he was really nice. The place was clean and the service was fast. Will definitely come here again with my family."}
{"text":"Back to Denny's as really - what else is open at midnight, the time of day when I am most hungry? The place was not as clean as last time, not too busy - at least not until the cheap Tuesday movie night let out. Unruly mob! Check please! (thankfully we were finishing as they were coming in)  Our server was great - she did not check on us throughout the meal but that was OK. It is really not that kind of place I guess? Observations: The water for the tea was barely warm The toast was stone cold as if it was pre-prepped which it likely was because at midnight the kitchen does not seem to give a crap The eggs were super runny when hubby ordered them over medium The pancakes were elasticky Won't return anytime soon regardless of their hours. One star lost since our last visit."}
{"text":"I just love coming to this Denny's restaurant. I always have the best service and my food is always hot and delicious. I cannot say that about other Denny's locations however. The manager of this restaurant is absolutely wonderful. All of the employees seem very happy to be working for this manager which is a rare sight in a restaurant. I feel like it is almost like family when I go to this place because it is my go to restaurant when I need something quick to eat. I literally have never had a bad experience at this location and I highly recommend it to any other Denny's lovers out there."}
{"text":"The worst coffee on the strip, but cheaper than the buffets. It's a Denny's with the usual fare."}
{"text":"Every Time I come to this place it seems like they get slower. So I came in today for dinner and the waitress that was waiting on me I really thought was a new person but it turns out that she is the manager...WHAT, seriously???"}
{"text":"This place is terrible, your better off eating McMuffins than here.    First off the welcome hosts if you wanna call them hosts, are not the friendliest.  I'm almost a 200 pound male, and I was asked to sit in this tiny miniature single booth.  I turned around and asked if they were serious.  You have to be probably  a kid or under 120 pounds to fit in that tiny booth.  My order took a while to arrive and not correct.  The fries were super cold.  And it also took about 20 minutes to get my 1st coffee refill.    I would strongly not recommend this joint.  Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Asked for and received my breakfast my way.  $4 value slam. Did you know they have 99 cent add-ons like bacon? Plus AARP gets 15% discount."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy Dennys so we started going to this location when we moved in the area.  We've been twice.  Both times we had issues.  First time the service was lacking.  Second time the food took forever to come out and then it was cold.  I dont think we will be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Food is consistent and I always order breakfast here, no matter what time of day.  They changed the recipe on the Pancakes and I don't think they are as good as they used to be.  Service is inconsistent here, but we had some great servers."}
{"text":"I remember Denny's being better - that being said, you can't go wrong with a free breakfast on your birthday.  You have to come ON the day of your birthday and show your ID and you'll get a free Grand Slam breakfast which is 2 eggs (however you like them), bacon, sausage and pancakes.  No frills but they serve great coffee and the waitress was a doll!    I'm sure I'll be back next year ;-)"}
{"text":"Came in for a late snack & ANNE took such great care of us!  She checked up on us and made sure our waters were always full. She came out and told me she made a fresh batch of coffee and asked if I wanted more!  Not to mention she was the only one on the floor.   Thank you ANNE for making a late night snack extra special!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning after an all night buss ride, we stopped at Denny's; big mistake. We ordered at 9:30, a bigger group; 6 people. After we got our drinks we waited. The bus would leave at 10:40, we get our food at 10:39 we delay the buss and get our food. The pancakes are are plain ( nothing on them) mozzarella sticks with no cheese, little to no sauce in the container and well over cooked. Vary displeased"}
{"text":"Went to Dennys on Sunday, July 24, 2016 to try their new pancakes. I am not a Dennys fan, but would say this was a good meal at a very good price.  I arrived around noon and it was busy, but not totally packed.  I was greeted at the front door and seated promptly.  Everyone I came in contact with was polite, professional and friendly. Denny's has all new menus and I was challenged to find a simple pancake breakfast. The waitress was particularly attentive and nice even though I was a single female.  She directed me to the value menu and I ended up ordering the $4.00 value pancake breakfast.  The food came out relatively quickly. It was hot, the eggs were scrambled and were good, the bacon nothing special, and the pancakes did not disappoint. They were indeed big and fluffy, with good flavor. For me, this breakfast was filling, tasty, and reasonably priced.  Why go anywhere else? The pancakes are a hit, which is what Denny's was hoping for!   I was particularly impressed with the service and the staff at this Denny's. Each Denny's is owned and operated by a franchisee. I would definitely come back and recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"My second time visiting this location. Troy was out waiter, he was very polite,and prompt with the service, even with the kitchen backed up. I hope he moves on the greener pastures though, he belongs at a much better location.   This location is fully staffed by has been bleach blond waitresses, you can tell they've had hard lives and they're lack of customer service shows.  I always only get breakfast here, my husband got a chicken avocado sandwich was was beyond disappointed.   Return factor? Sure, when I really really really just want some dennys!"}
{"text":"This is the nicest Denny's I've ever been in. It's really cool inside. The servers have always been great. There's a little coffee nook that I've never seen in any of the other Denny's."}
{"text":"Don't come after 10 they'll have every table open and won't sit you down for 20 minutes who does this ? They take hours to set up a table , I just wanted some water man fml"}
{"text":"Where to start? Sunday 12:30ish myself and 2 friends decided to go to Denny's cause In N Out had the longest line I've ever seen there. It was not too busy when we got to Dennys. Maybe 6-7 tables taken. We ordered our drinks first. Took about 10 min for water and coffee to come. Ordered our food once the drinks finally came. When we were done eating, we asked for 2 boxes and the checks. We LITERALLY waited over 20 minutes for our waitress to come back with the boxes and checks. Our waitress did not have many tables once we first asked for the box and checks. There were only 3 tables taKen in the whole place! She kept walking past us, would look at us looking at her, and she still never came over. We had to ask a different waitress to get our check for us after the 20 min. She clearly was very embarrassed she FORGOT about us.  That is all."}
{"text":"Been to this Denny's multiple times.  The food is good, not great.  The service is usually good, but the last time I was there, the server was terrible.  He spilled ten glasses of water all other me.  I was angry, walked outside in the heat for a few minutes to calm down, and then came in with my shorts eventually drying.  Other people in the group had problems with this server as well when ordering.  Sadly, one of my friends wrote about him on a comment card, and the manager called him informing him that he was fired.  Personally, I wouldn't have wanted him fired, but I will say I was quite annoyed with him that night."}
{"text":"You will regret it... Horrible location. Took forever to seat us despite being less than half full. Rubbery bacon. Toast with no toast.  Luke warm day old coffee. Dirty. I don't write many reviews but this Dennys inspired me."}
{"text":"8 months later and it's still BAD! This is my last review on this Dennys since I am moving back to California but tonight's meal was the final straw!  Came in around 11ish PM and they were not busy at all! Yet it still took awhile to be seated/acknowledged! The server seated us and that was it, no greeting or anything -___- I give kudos to our server she wasn't too bad it was the food that put the nail in the coffin for us! My mom's order came out perfectly but when it came to mines it came out in 3 different times!  The food was downright inedible! I don't know how the cook could even poise himself to send out this quality of food out! My cheese quesadilla was overcooked/burnt! The few bites I had before I did send it out had a burnt taste to it and it looked overcooked! 10 minutes later my order of French fries came out and they were so UNDERCOOKED it was ridiculous! They literally were still white! How could you send something out to a customer like this?! By this time I was so over my food, if my mom wasn't still eating I probably would have walked out! Then another 10 minutes later my pancake puppies came out and I had one bite of these and did not like them at all. I know what they are supposed to taste like and these had no flavor and weren't cooked all the way. I didn't even bother complaining about them because I didn't want so seem like that \"unhappy customer\" but I was truly unhappy and dissatisified with my meal. All 3 of those items should have been comped and never been sent out to the customer!   I have been to this location 3 times and 2 out of the 3 times has been an epic fail! Management is never present when I come and it's too inconsistent! The cooks defininitely need some retraining! This is the end of my relationship with this location!   -____-"}
{"text":"No really a busy day and took 20min to take our drink order. To then come back 15min after that to take our order. Then 20min after that came back to retake our order because she had \"lost\" her order paper. I was served cold coffee and the food was ok. The server wasn't rude nor friendly just kind of blah. Defiantly recommend the location on Tropicana and Decatur over this one any day."}
{"text":"At 3:00 am i can understand a lot of drunks eativ some food but really i was taking a break from driving with Lyft and all i heard was extremely loud talking swearing and LOUD laughing  All i wanted to do was eat my food and get back on the road  Food was hot and service was great thank you for that but the customers were horribel"}
{"text":"t was high school after a night of drinking that I think was the last time I was at a Denny's.  Now that I'm grown up, coming to a Denny's with aged parents was a totally different experience.  It is much more diner-like than I remember.  The menu is also more limited than I remember, but it had a couple items that would have made me happy.  I got the grilled chicken salad with apples, cranberries and a candied nut. It had a nice variety of greens and a good amount of toppings.  I was really impressed.  It was very tasty.   My dad got the same thing and Mom got a grilled sandwich of some sort with a big piece of meat in it.  It came with a fruit cup that looked fabulous.  I mentioned my surprise of going to Denny's and how I enjoyed it.  We've never been to a Denny's before but I imagine we will now.  He said he loves Denny's!"}
{"text":"Wow, complete 180.  Ordered again from dennys for some take out pot roast. This time I was never placed on hold, the potatoes were just perfect and the pot roast tasted even more yummy then the last batch. To top it off I think that was the best job I've seen any dennys do on the garlic bread toast. Very pleased and glad to see it was just a fluke the night before."}
{"text":"When we entered did not even get a greeting from the hostess. Had her head down when she was cashing out other patrons. We waited ten minutes and she was talking to other coworkers then after noticing we weren't going to be seated I asked if we could sit at the bar. Then we received no menus. Waited ten more minutes for a word. Ordered did the receive drink for ten minutes. Received half of the food and forgot the salsa for my omelet. Worse customer service ever"}
{"text":"Hunnie Bunnie and I are getting breakfast before school!  She chose her Mac n Cheese which came with a side of fries.  And I opted for the healthyish Veggie omelette with a side of fruit an an English muffin.  Breakfast came out pretty fast and hot.  I also discovered I don't mind swiss cheese as long as it's melted... Like inside my omelette. It was good!  Service was nice and friendly. We were in and out and on our way to school!"}
{"text":"Gives my zen face -.-  I have no idea as to why they have a menu with bacon on items such as Ice cream. Ugh that's not for me but others may very well love it. I Had breakfast with my husband it was great bacon eggs toast and orange juice. It was cooked correct the first time and the service was just ok nothing to write home to mama about. The wait time was crazy long and over all I give it three stars. I did provide pictures so take a look."}
{"text":"Refreshing. Excellent staff...no bad apples. Food quality...Folks....its Denny's. Denny's food is Denny's food. Good comfort food. Total bill for 2 was $17.95 tipped $5.00 (28%). I generally start my tip at 20% and go downhill from there, rarely do I go higher then 20%."}
{"text":"The Belgian Waffle Slam was a bunt at best. I was still hungry after the meal and the waffles were dense as if the batter was watered down to stretch it out. Server was super friendly and food came out quick."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER : This review is based solely on my love of people watching...not eats.  It's simple lady's and Mary's..... if you have been to this Jenny's (thx Brian) at 2am on a Sat night I do not even need to continue. If you haven't....I recommend that you do. Nuff said"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch 3/31/2017. We were seated quickly since we were here for lunch 12pm. We both ordered the Grand Slam breakfast.  We were disappointed that they didn't have Sausage patties as part of Grand Slam breakfast. The bacon was thin and see-through."}
{"text":"This Denny's has improved since Madison is now smoke free. Before the smoking ban, this place was like eating in an ashtray. Now, it's a good place to get what you'd expect from Denny's."}
{"text":"Absolute worst dining experience of my life. If I could give negative stars, I would. Part of my group for there 15 minutes before me and had only gotten acknowledged a short moment before I walked in. After we sat down, it was a solid 10 more minutes before we our server came through for drinks. It wasn't busy at all. I ordered plain chicken strips with honey mustard, and was given buffalo strips with ranch. I went with it because I was really hungry and didn't feel like waiting any longer for them to re-make food. 2 of my friends also ordered streaks, one of them gluten free with no bread, and was given a rare steak with bread. I guess the server didn't understand what allergies are, and she got an attitude when he said it had to be re-made. I work in food service and let a lot of stuff slide, but this was absolutely the most pathetic experience I've ever had in my life, double points for being the last night of my vacation."}
{"text":"I went to go eat there with my sister, we went inside and no one was there to assist us we waited there for an hour my sister and I kept calling out, horrible customer service, we saw one of the chief just sitting there talking on the phone, never going there"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best Denny's I've  ever been to. We have eaten here last three mornings, no matter how long the line outside waiting to get in they move it quickly. They always say 10 to 15 minutes, yet we got in within  six minutes. Despite being crowded service is quick and friendly.  No my rating is compared to other breakfast style restaurants, obviously not prepared to gourmet type restaurants."}
{"text":"sometimes your friends remind you that Dennys is delicious! we all know we have several options with a variety of different foods available in the am hours! one of my favorites is the breakfast burger!  this time I opted for the classic double cheeseburger.  a side of ranch for their delicious fries and I was in hog heaven!  my friend loves their country fried steak! I have to admit it was appealing from across the table.  but wait there's more! they have the fancy coke machine with over a hundred different flavors. long story short.and they have booze.  we made it outta their in less than an hour! satisfied with good service."}
{"text":"Wow, such vitriol in some of these reviews for Denny's. My experience has been somewhere in between. I've only been here for breakfast on the weekends, usually in the 8:30-9:30am range. If it's a weekend that they've sent out coupons, it's busy and the service can be spotty. Heck even if it's slow it's spotty, but never have I dealt with rude servers. Free wifi is always a plus. Food is basic diner food. It may not be the best breakfast in town, but what brings me back is the build your own Grand Slam. I can pack it full of stuff I want to eat - like protein! - and not be stuck with toast that I'm never going to eat. So until something better comes along, I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's Denny's--how bad can it be? Well let me tell you...this visit to Denny's was B.A.D. It was over 90 minutes from start to finish and we were seated immediately on a weekday morning. Food came out S.L.O.W and our server was even slower. We didn't get refills nor were they even offered. My husband's pancakes were burnt on the outside and still runny on the inside. The fruit that came with my breakfast had been frozen and wasn't quite thawed out yet. I have eaten at this Denny's before and while the service has never been all that stellar, this was by far the worst visit to a Denny's I've ever experienced and because it's Denny's my expectations are pretty low to begin with. Do yourself a favor and skip this particular Denny's. You will save yourself the aggravation."}
{"text":"Two stars for the food. Five stars for the servers.  I can't remember his name, but you have a gentleman working there who seems to be the happiest person in the world.  I really hope you pay him well enough."}
{"text":"It good for breakfast. Waitress says they been thru some changes and hope they are done!  Food is always dependable is why we stop on our travels."}
{"text":"On Saturday the Aug. 15th I went there with two friends after a terrible experience at TGI Fridays on Sahara and Decatur. The prices were much better and the food was great. Been to many of the Denny's here in Las Vegas and most of them have excellent service and food and the prices are reasonable with good portion sizes."}
{"text":"The prices and the food was great. Been to many of the Denny's here in Las Vegas and most of them have excellent service and food and the prices are reasonable. Most of the Denny's are under-staffed especially in service. They work hard to keep up though. Many nights i would come here or another Denny's and there would only be one waitress working the entire floor. We were served in a reasonable time but I feel for the waitress  having to work the floor by herself and the register and bus the tables and all her other duties."}
{"text":"This truck stop locations sucks at 5am I attempted to call in an order for pickup the server hung up on me I called back she did not pickup. 5:08 I attempt to order online found out that system is down does not work would not accept me as a guess then I create a profile it will not accept my credit card. 5:20 we drive to this location to order take out only to find their new waitress/server working alone she has 3 customers at the bar. We ask for take out which took forever to prepare the drink was forgotten and it all adds up to poor management."}
{"text":"Food coma! Walked in & seated straight away! Great restaurant set up! Nice & clean, service was all smiles very happy vibe coming from dawn our server. Food was delicious & the portion sizes were super size, loved our time here. Thank you for your lovely service! My fav Denny so far! X"}
{"text":"After a rough start, and being seated in a very noisy and over crowded side room, we asked to be seated in the main dining room.  Much quieter, and relaxing... Needless to say,, thing's improved conciderably.  Starting with our fantastic friendly server Mila, who attended to our needs with a smile and excellent customer service skills.  The food was excellent as well.  The loaded veggie omelette with fresh fruit and English Muffin was very good.  As was the coffee.    My wife ordered the scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese, two pancakes, sausage and bacon.  She said they were the best pancakes she has ever had.  I would highly recommend Denny's for your dinning enjoyment experience."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on April 29, 2018  Breakfast  was good.  The View on the patio is AMAZING!  We had a server by the name of Kahlia - she was terrific!  Very Friendly and Efficient!  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I don't even really know what to say about this. I walk in, stand idly and patiently for 5-10 minutes, some staff member barks at me about whether I'm waiting to be seated (I was), and then, in a 3/4ths empty restaurant, tells me there's a wait list and no, they can't tell me how long the wait is.   What an absurd experience."}
{"text":"Good Service, consistent \"Denny's Style\" food prep and what appears to be a well managed franchise store. the wait persons were very attentive and happy. The whole experience was a pleasure.  Nothing much more to say..."}
{"text":"Look, I normally enjoy Denny's, but I'm not quite sure what happened during my visit to this particular Denny.  Now granted, it was about 11:45 PM after a night out bowling, so perhaps that influenced things a bit.  Nevertheless, my experience was not as I was expecting.  The service was friendly, though very slow at this particular time.  It took about 20 minutes after being seated to get our drink and food orders.  The waiter was impressive at first in memorizing the orders for our party of 7, except he didn't quite memorize it.  Some of our orders were slightly altered, though corrected promptly.  The food was good, but seemed kind of cold.  This was most likely related to the slow service.  While our waiter was nice and friendly, I can tell the place was understaffed when there was clearly a good number of patrons at the time.    I'll probably be back when I'm in the area, but during regular/business hours."}
{"text":"The food at Dennys is always just okay to me anyways but this location is horrible. When we walked in I noticed an exchange between a manager and an angry customer and right away that sent up a red flag. Our waitress was TERRIBLE she had to be reminded what our drink orders were, reminded to bring us silverware and even when the food came out, not only did it take forever (at least 45 minutes) it was wrong and she forgot to bring half the order. Even after asking about our missing food twice it never came.  She was not friendly and acted like we were annoying her bc our order was wrong.  Of course the food that we ordered but never received was on the bill and had to be changed. The manager said they were going to take an additional 20% off but in the end they couldn't figure out how to do it and charged us full price anyway. As we were walking out we over heard another unhappy customer complaining to management so I guess they just really suck all around. Never going back."}
{"text":"Do not go there! Our food was cold, my boyfriend got a big eggshell in his eggs and the pancakes were really tiny. I recommend all the other Denny's near the Strip but not this one. And the service was not good either. We were really disappointed."}
{"text":"I go to Denny's on a regular basis.  This location is known for having ridiculous wait times.  Wait for table then wait for food.  The food is good but when your expecting to go to a movie next door, DON'T GO HERE.    Service 3/5 Venue and convenience 5/5 Food 4/5 Price 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Okay, 5 stars for Denny's? We were there on a Sunday evening, 9 p.m.-ish, and did not want to get back in the car after a long day driving. This was in our hotel parking lot; we read all of the bad reviews, figured it didn't matter how bad it was. Well, we walked in, immediately seated, told who are waitress would be, and handed menus. 2 minutes, here's Julia, our waitress. Took our drink orders, came right back. Given a few minutes to decide, took our food orders. Food was back in 10-12 minutes - perfectly what we ordered. Made just right, tasted great, never had to wait long for Julia to show up.  There were maybe 10 or more people in the restaurant; two waitresses and a hostess at the register. Yes, it was a Denny's, but if they all worked as good as this one did for us, they would be an amazing restaurant chain."}
{"text":"Well let's just say the booth was dirty before i sat down silverware was dirty asked for new silverware it was also dirty management didn't seem to really care that I received dirty silverware a second time  I will never ever eat at a Dennys again so with that said eat at your own RISK...."}
{"text":"I was in here on a saturday night sunday morning bout 3:00 AM june 24 2018. The black lady working there was straight rude. Will not eat here again with such rude server."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place!!! Came home and my body went straight diarrhea mode! Here is a tip to improve this area. Get more friendly waiters and better cooks that actually care how the the food is cooked. I know people have to make money and some jobs don't pay well but I sure tipped the lady well and there is plenty people like me that are looking for a healthy clean meal that tip well. All I'm saying is this, if your going to get a job that requires u to feed people have some self dignity. This is life were talking about, depending on the way someones body reacts towards bacterial foods could cause death! And you would be sued! Please guys if your working in restaurant caring for peoples foods make sure u do it with clean hands and well inspections , imagine if someone did the same thing to u, how would u feel? Step it up guys & gals were better then that. Thank u!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast, got seated, got my drink, ordered and went to the bathroom... ROACHES!!  Yes, several.... I told the server there are roaches in the bathroom she said \"Yup there sure are, Hon!.\"   OMG!  Seriously??? I had to leave...   I will never be back!"}
{"text":"Where do i begin... when we arrived we were seated within 5 min of our arrival. As soon as we sit our waitress come to the table and gives my wife and i the most uncomfortable \"up and down\" stare. We order our drinks. The waitress brings me my coffee with nothing to stir it with. I waited until she came around and thats when i asked her for a spoon to stir my coffee. To my disbelief she grunted! We were going to walk out but decided to stay. I ordered a burger (bland!) My wife ordered French toast and eggs. (She said it was good.) I probably will NEVER return here! Tip for staff...dont judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"Service was subpar from waitress Stephanie. The redeeming factor was the waitress named India. She was attentive, upbeat, and friendly even though we were not in her section. I ordered bacon very very very crispy. What I got was rubbery undercooked bacon. Sent it back and waitress Stephanie slammed plate back on the table and said is that ok? Had to ask for more coffee and then for cream. Horrible service. If you do go, ask for India. She is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible!  $12 for a club sandwich that was thrown together - bread was small, hardly toasted, fries from a freezer, etc.  won't be back."}
{"text":"We went here tonight and we waited for 30 mins then we finally went up to someone and said we have been waiting. No one even acknowledge us or brought drinks nothing. Then they talked to our server and he denied that we were his table and kept on doing what he was doing. After we decided that we didn't want to wait anymore they walked over asking if we wanted drinks. We said no and left the restaurant. We went to IHOP down street instead and got excellent service and food was awesome!!! Would never recommend this Denny's at all they suck."}
{"text":"Crappy experience again.  We (4) sat down and ordered our lunch/breakfast.  Waitress never came back drinks were empty.  We asked for silverware and napkins which no success.  Waitress refills our drinks 25-30 minutes later.  The waitress came back to tell us that our order had been passed up this entire time.  She said there are a couple of orders ahead of us but it is coming.  45 wasted minutes.  The service has been like this the last two times we have tried to eat here.  We came to this Dennys at my 12yr old sons request.  The manager didn't even come to our table to apologize.    We decided to leave and I stopped to pay for our drinks.  I had to request to speak to the manager.  He apologized for the mix up of course and agreed to pay for the tab.  We were not going to eat there today or in the future.   For some reason this Dennys can't get it right.  Wanted to give it no stars but t this app doesn't allow it"}
{"text":"Service is good but the cups were very spotty plus my sons cup looked dirty plus it had lipstick on the cup.  So the server gave us a to go cup to use.  Then when the food came he all the silverware again was very spotty and then my sons spoon had dried up.egg yolk all over the spoon.  I mentioned it to the server and she said not to worry because it is clean and has all the chemicals then gave my son another set of silverware.   Food was good... but i still prefer Ihop on ft apache and tropicana's food and pancake."}
{"text":"This Denny's is very fast, but don't expect a good meal. The server was very busy and nice, it was obvious they were understaffed. The manager with black hair kept yelling and talking about cleaning the bathroom, yuck! Food was okay, expected for Denny's. Have been here before with okay service, hope they do better next time."}
{"text":"I have been pleased overall with my visits here.  I special ordered one of those skillet breakfasts to share with my breakfast partner. The waitress was very receptive to taking a special order. After she returned to see if everything was alright I explained to her that the special order part had been overlooked.  She had the order corrected quite quickly and it was then brought to us by the manager who sincerely apologized and made further offers of goodwill.  I have been back a couple of times since and no mistakes, good serving size - easily able to share it between two and steady coffee refills.  I will go back again for certain."}
{"text":"Quick Review cause hey....it's Denny's and I feel like my comments below about the service aren't fair because it was Fathers Day and they were clearly understaffed.  Food:  Blueberry Pancake Puppies - Phenomenal Grandslamwich - Lots of cheese (too much) but was spot on (not the greatest but better than a homemade breakfast sandwich) (ask for a side of maple syrup to dip this in!)  Service: Poor, took 15 minutes after being sat to get order taken, 10 more minutes to get water, and 30 minutes later to get food, (5 minutes after food got check haha)  Though again, understaffed on Fathers Day and this place was packed. So I feel like this is slightly unfair but this is a review and I call it like I see it."}
{"text":"Staff is nice however my family and I went in for the first time for breakfast and even though our waitress was very nice,  she completely forgot about us after she took our order for drinks, after another young lady seen us waiting for a long time she reminded our waitress about our drinks then she took our order and we sat there for about 45min with absolutely no service. Everyone who came in after us received their food and ours still no where to be seen. The young lady once again noticed that we were waiting for a long time so she went and reminded our waitress about us again. About 10-15min later our food arrived, we ordered chocolate chip pancakes but the chocolate chips were missing so she put some on a plate, I ordered banana strawberry pancakes and I got an order of red white and blue!! We ate as quickly as we could because we were just so tired and annoyed from all waiting. We went up to the register to pay because we didn't want to wait another hour to pay with our waitress and the cashier asked if we wanted to leave a tip, ofcourse we said No due to the service we received and we were given a $2 and some change of a discount.  We weren't looking to get a discount but $2 doesn't replace the service we received!  Never again will I dine in at this location! !"}
{"text":"Fast service and turnaround for a busy location.  Ordered to go, and they expedited taking my order and having it ready.  Food is on par for Denny's.  Good location."}
{"text":"Came to Denny's because I love their food. However, this location was absolutely awful. We went in for dinner ON MOTHERS DAY, and we waited in the lobby for 10 minutes. The restaurant was completely empty with only one table occupied. The 2 servers were busy with their own shit and did not even acknowledge us. They saw us, but turned and continued with whatever they were doing. They didn't say a single word to us. We waited and waited in hopes that they would at least let us know they'd be with us shortly, however that did not happen. To the manager of this particular establishment, do your business a favor and change your staff. I'm so disgusted that my moms special day was ruined because of the apathetic service from the staff."}
{"text":"Thank you for feeding my inebriated self some delicious sliders and fries at 4:30am. I actually am not sure if they were delicious or not but my friend said I dove for the last fry on the plate when she was trying to get me to head back to the hotel. I believe that and the fact that I ate 2 of the 3 sliders we orderd is an indicator that the food was good. Thank you for letting me think that by my friend and I wearing our sunglasses inside at that time that no one would notice how drunk we were. Finally thank you for letting me nap for a minute or two in the booth while we awaited the arrival of our food."}
{"text":"I love Dennys and try to visit one whenever I am out of NYC. We saw a lot of Denny restaurants in Vegas.  They had the value breakfast meals for $2, 4 and $6. There was always a 10-15 minute wait for a tabe but it was definitely worth it. The staff were okay and the food was delicious. I also tried the smoothies (mango & strawberry banana) which were good. You get the bang for your buck at this spot."}
{"text":"It's Denny's...how tough can it be to follow the standard recipes and cookie-cutter-esque nature that is Denny's? This particular joint does a good job. Friendly, accommodating staff and the same basic food that you expect from Denny's. This location has been here for years and I've never had a bad experience. It's a solid 3 star all the way!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at this Denny's this morning.  Everything was fine, until three drunken, foul language ruffians, entered  with half finished beer.  He was told by server, he could not bring liquor in the restaurant.  He muttered a long stream of profanity, but went outside. His  two companions stayed in booth.  It escalated with the third one returning.  They got rowdier and louder, at that time, manager stepped in and politely asked them to leave. Something was left on table. Manager had items to return to them, as they came back in to get them. The guy went to table to look for something more. The buss person was cleaning table & guy was being aggressive with him. The MANAGER stepped in between his employee and the guy.  ( told the employee to go to back)  again this young manager of Denny's was polite and just said kindly for the guy to go.   We were feeling a bit cautious not knowing what could happen next. It's scary nowadays just getting breakfast."}
{"text":"Very busy on Sun morning. Warmish food. Lots of waiting.   Not the best service. Very busy and slow.  Every time I come here there are dirty dishes left on tables. Today a tray of dishes was left on a table near us for at least 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! No manager working to resolve issue with my meal.   They could not cook a steak correctly. Over cooked or under cooked. Just want a steak medium rare. Eggs over easy were greasy....yuck. Hash Browns were burned.   Place is messy& dirty.  Stay away from this place.  Bathrooms are dirty & disgusting."}
{"text":"the service is bad, very slow.it took 45 minutes for our order. our supposed to be breakfast became a lunch for us."}
{"text":"The watress we had was overwelmed with her 4 tables. The food was cold she never ask if our meal was ok we ask for the manger she came over said sorry bought our breakfast never came back the watress said she was sorry she forgot about us. This is the 3rd time we came here thinking it might get better but nope still sucks. Go to IHOP. Just want to tell you don't ever ever ever ever eat there again"}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE!!!!!! I called in my to go order, they said 20m......I wait 25m and I go in and they still hadn't put my order in!!!! And I had to be at work!!! And then they had the nerve to make me pay for a drink that I originally placed!!!! WTF dennys!!! Get your shhh together!!!! Horrible customer service!!!! At least give me my drink for free after you 'forgot' to put in my order!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Waited at table for 15 min no service the went to bar and took order 90 people running around but no one carries"}
{"text":"The food was fine as always with Denny's, our server was very good, but the food took forever. And people who ordered after us were getting their food ahead of us ... basically their kitchen is one tick shy of a disaster. They need to get some management focus on it or their average 2 Star rating will not improve. Certainly I am unlikely to come back unless I have an entire half day to kill to eat a meal."}
{"text":"Over cooked bacon...Hard waffle...Slow kitchen and the waitress got my order wrong...brought me scrambled eggs instead of sunny side up...had an exchanged...took another 20mins though"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this location 2 stars because the food is good other than that I HATE coming to this dennys past 12am. Lately when i get off of work at 2/3am it seems like EVERYTIME i call they neverrrr want to answer their phones. You guys are a 24hr service! ?"}
{"text":"Been to this location once this week and we had really great service!   Got seated as soon as we got there. Didn't have a wait time and even when requested a booth which was available. The place wasn't really that crowded but still pretty busy. Coffee was hot and tasty. Ordered our food right away and even got it quick too!  I wish I remembered her name but she was really engaged when making a conversation with me and my mom. She even talked with my dtr as well and.  Ordered of the $2, $4, $6, $8 menu and got the French toast for $8. It came with coffee and a drink, and my dtr ordered the chocolate chip pancakes. Since I didn't want the drink the waitress offered it to my dtr..... way cool to look out for your customers on spending less than needed on drinks.   The food was delish! Never a disappointment with Denny's!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go order, pretty fast and very friendly staff. The only downside is that they don't serve soup after 10pm lol. Anyways what more do you need to know about dennys. Go get you fill at any hour!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, its the usual Denny's chain restaurant. Server were very pleasant and nice to everyone. Good for a quick breakfast with a nice coffee."}
{"text":"Usually this is a pretty good place for breakfast but I got burnt toast and it took over 10 minutes for the under-toasted toast to come and I asked the server and he was a little rude saying he put the order in!! GEEZ I thought they made the toast themselves. Plus the eggs had runny whites and I ordered them over med.  Not a good experience this time."}
{"text":"It's clean, the servers were friendly and there's always an interesting diner, or five (if you happen to be as lucky as I was to be dining the same time as a self proclaiming, \"former 70s rocker\"). It's the usual Denny's food, but when its late and everything else around here is closed, it's worth going to."}
{"text":"I came into this Denny's because I didn't feel like eating anywhere on the strip. As soon as I walked in, I was seated which is great for a Denny's that's crowded. I ordered my super bird plate which came with fries. when the food good there, I noticed a small layer of oil on bottom of the plate where my fries were placed. They look fresh but still super oily. I asked waiter nicely if he could replace them as I didn't want to eat oily fries. The manager came by to ask if everything was ok after I noticed the second batch was greasier than the first. I was unhappy about them as I was honest (not harsh) and said \"just forget it, I don't want them replaced again\". She came back and was super apologetic and offer a discount for the incident. I felt extremely bad as I was not looking to cause a scene over fries. My partner and I finished our meal and then went to go checkout. After paying, I asked the cashier for managers name and I spoke with her again and was once again apologetic and e pressed to her that I wasn't looking for a discount, she understood and we had a nice chat. I wish I remembered her name. I was there on sunday 5/20/18 around noon."}
{"text":"Hilariously bad.  Don't go there late at night unless you want to get fucked with by punk kids and possibly mugged.  Or do go there late at night if you want to watch a full on brawl while enjoying your ice cold grand slam that you waited an hour for."}
{"text":"Oh Denny's comfort food, late night grub, and breakfast all day!   It's a 'murican tradition. No happy hour or beer but they do have a $2 $4 $6 $8 special menu going (yes really 2 4 6 8, who do you appreciate?)  I've had the delish Bourbon Bacon Burger, shakes are real dairy, onion rings worthy of take-home-the-leftovers.   Selfie photobooth up front, free WiFi, and if you love pancakes they have everything.   Usual goto food item as a kid was \"moons over my hammy\" which is still good today. Though I don't have little kiddos, this place seems quite kid friendly.   A few TVs around but nothing in your face. They play fun, festive music.   Wow the A/C in some spots cranks out, but they will seat you away if you don't like the cold.   Can't imagine when this place was ever bad before, but bathrooms were spotless, tables and floors clean, wait staff friendly and chatty as you'd expect a nice laid back Denny's diner to be.   Prices cheap, we usually get out of there just over $20 for the two of us. They try hard, quick to fix anything imperfect.  Would give 5 stars if they served booze like the ones in California do, so 4 it is. Worth the trip either way."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here. Should've known it would be bad by the lack of cars in the parking lot. The appetizer came out and was absolutely delicious. Then everything went downhill from there. My chicken tenders were soaked in mashed potatoes and gravy. They didn't even try to separate it on the plate. My soup had no flavor and tasted like they watered it down to avoid making more the proper way. On top of that, the waitress was super ditzy. She took another guests plate of food away before he was even done eating. When she asked how everything was, we replied \"Ehh it's alright\" with disgusted looks. She replies with \"okay great!\" and walked away. The manager hid in the back booth and didn't seem very friendly. Next time, I'll be sure to go to the other Dennys right around the corner."}
{"text":"Smells like sewer inside and out.  Waitress was rude and behind.   Manager started serving tables that came in well after me.  Two tables that didn't even sit until after my order was placed got their food as I sat watching them eating I just got up and left.   I know it's only Dennys but come on."}
{"text":"10 Reasons why I found this Denny's so comical:  1.  We walk in and this ex-army style woman took down our name, and was like so commanding and loud and I just started cracking up from her.  2.  I didn't realize that EVERYONE in Vegas goes to this Denny's for breakfast.  3.  Half the people are so drunk from last night they think they're going to dinner.  4.  We get seated, and I order an iced coffee with no sugar, that came back with \"extra sugar\".  Next time listen guy.  5.  *I look around seeing all the hungover people of Las Vegas, once more*  6.  The food was surprisingly amazing.... Giggle to that as well.  I had a breakfast burrito, with egg, bacon, avocado, and tomatoes.  It was really really good, i was so surprised.    7.  The waiter didn't like me when i sent back the coffee, and then asked him to give me a straw for the second coffee, without sugar this time.  8.  When I asked if their was free refills, the waiter said \"DUH\".  I started cracking up in his face.  9.  For three, the cost of breakfast was like $30, which is just a tad more than the price of coffee and a bagel in Manhattan. LOL  10.  We were sitting at our table for 30 minutes after we had finished our food, because the waiter didn't tell us that you pay at a separate cash register.  We were waiting for him to come back, it was just hilarious.   Good experience, your garenteed, good, quick, food, and a pretty good laugh too!"}
{"text":"Yeah. Looking at previous reviews I can't say anything is getting better at this particular location. First time there this morning and not a pleasant experience. Seemed short staffed, if I want the easy way out. Lipstick on my mug, endless waiting, etc. Hope someone starts reading and giving a crap about bad reviews.  Over medium eggs requested. Seared over easy served. Not sure how that's even possible but it was today.  Should have been paid for my meal today, not the other way around. Rubbish."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Nothing like the negative reviews suggest. Edit: I wanted to make this a review to help the number of stars this Denny's has gotten because I felt it was being rated unfairly, but Yelp told me my review was too short and made it a tip. All I can say is the food was just as good as it is at any other Denny's and the service was just as good if not better than I've ever had. I count on Denny's for consistent quality, and this location did not disappoint in the least."}
{"text":"When I think of Denny's I think of a nice, quiet night with an amazing selection of food, drinks, and dessert. You come to Denny's because it's convenient, the food is good, and it's all well-priced. So obviously, this is one of my favorite places. One time, after an all-nighter, I came here with my GF at 5 a.m. and it was the best. It's never too full, which means the service is always fast.  The breakfast food is my favorite - I could eat breakfast day and night and I'd get it from here. I'm not a huge fan of the dinner items (fish, burgers, etc.), but it's because of my personal preference on the type of cuisine, not the establishment's food itself. Yesterday we came here because we were too lazy to cook at home LOL and we wanted pancakes. Our server was Michael - he was amazing! He got all our stuff to us very quickly, and I'm pretty sure he was the only waiter waiting on about five or six tables. I'm hoping next time we go to Denny's we'll get him again. :)  I'm giving Denny's three stars because it's Denny's...I mean, can you get better food elsewhere? Sure. Can you get better service somewhere else? Yeah, maybe. But that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still good and it's....cozy. It's not \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" and it shouldn't be (in my opinion) because then that means it's so hyped up that it would always be crowded. And yes, I'm a fan - but I say A-OK because it's a term my grandpa uses to describe something that's pleasant and familiar. It's the old, married couple enjoying dinner after 65 years together; it's the mom and her child coloring outside the lines. Pleasant and familiar :)"}
{"text":"Slow service.  Rude service.  Did I mention slow service.   Did I mention terrible service ????    I can't stand going to this Dennys but it's close by so I do it now and then."}
{"text":"It's Denny's so it's the same quality as anyplace else. The service here is nice. They do make an effort to keep drinks filled and serve the food at the right temperature. But if you've eaten at one Denny's then you've pretty much experienced the menu so there's not much else to say!"}
{"text":"Really like that this is a 24 hour option. The staff were really nice; our server, Josh, knew the menu well and was constantly checking to see if we needed anything and/or how we found the food. Quality of the food is what I'd expect from a cost concious diner. I did appreciate that there were a few healthier salad options."}
{"text":"Standard Denny's get a 3 in my book normally. Pretty standard food nothing special. But this one gets the extra star for being Vegas special. How can you not love having option to order BOGO bloody Mary's and mimosas while waiting for seats or even at your table. When in Vegas after having a Vegas kind of night, it was truly a life saver to be greeted with bloody Mary's unexpectedly. And the reason we ended up there on day 2 Of our trip was every other breakfast spot was extremely long wait and break the bank prices. We thought we were settling here but was pleasantly surprised with a short wait, drinks, and the food and service was solid for being in a busy spot. We were so happy it was Denny's in the morning for the next 3 days of the trip! It was our new morning meeting spot before getting the day stared. Great job Denny's coming in the clutch."}
{"text":"Ok I am going to start off by creating the scene for you all. Denny's is never on the list for a breakfast spot, but since we were on a job that was miles away from anything but a Dennys, we decided...What the hell. First off its always annoying being seated at a table between two huge families full of bratty, carpet munching, screaming children when the rest of the entire restaurant is empty..Browsing the menu in which even in the pictures of the food, the food still looks shitty... in rolls a man in a wheelchair with his leg literally sawed off at the knee. It wasnt bandaged or covered, just there for everyone to enjoy over breakfast. Our waitress hobbles over and we are assuming she is pulling a double after working the night shift. I order the 2 egg breakfast and my hubs orders the western omelet. When the food comes it seems not only the plate, my coffee cup and the food are all the same color. There is no color, no flavor, and no life to this food. Basically whatever ihop throws away, dennys recooks  and serves it to customers. So we are sitting there basically separating our food with forks, and even only after taking a few bites I wish to God I could force myself to throw up. Slowly my energy is being sucked out of me as my body tries to digest this salted load of crap...when the raging gas begins. I will tell you the only fun reason to go to Denny's, is they have the perfect \"Pleather\" to really let your farts rip roar and soar."}
{"text":"We visited this Denny's while in Vegas for spring break and wanted a reliable breakfast off the strip.  We arrived about 12:10 pm ready to order breakfast, not too crowded so we were pleased.  We ordered within 7 minutes and sat for nearly 30 minutes before our server even came back out.  No food, just telling us he's sorry it's taking so long but the cook is trying to find another cook to come in as he was by himself and orders were backed up.  10 more minutes pass and we call the server over to ask if our order had at least been started.  He came back and confirmed our order hadn't even been started!  We said to cancel it and as we walked out there were four other tables all there longer than we had been also waiting for their orders!  I have never experienced this EVER in my life!  If you don't have the proper staff - up front or in the kitchen - then don't keep seating people for God sakes!!!! And if the cook is backed up at least let the patrons know so they don't waste their time.  I wouldn't come back here even if they paid me!!"}
{"text":"The worst service known to man kind !!!! Sat for 15 minuets and asked to move because of the Vegas sun beaming on my friend. Then after the 15 the server comes up. We're like can we have another server and that takes another 10 minuets. Luis shouldn't even be given the responsibility to handle even two tables. He legit didn't even ask we wanted water or even say hold on. We then got another server and she was working over the top for us which gives the one star. The server Luis sucks and so does the atmosphere. I will be complaining to there corporate also. Thanks for nothing. Oh and the pancakes suck"}
{"text":"The @DennysDiner at 3001 S Las Vegas Blvd was great!!  Patient, great service, and well organized!!  Thank you #dennys !!  They got it the food out fast, considering they were slammed (pun intended), and it was tasty too!"}
{"text":"This place made us wait 45 minutes for pancakes. Do not stop here for food unless, you have lots time."}
{"text":"Early Sunday breakfast. Party of 18! Yeah, last minute family get together for breakfast. We did not call ahead or anything. Line was out the door but she told us we had a 15 minute wait. Believe it or not, we got our tables (all together too) in 15 minutes!  Drinks were taken and came out quickly. Food didn't take too long either. We were surprised. Everything was good. Your average Denny's food. Waitress refilled our drinks without asking and came to check on us multiple times. Manager dropped by twice too to make sure all was good. Like someone said below though, we saw four booths sit empty almost the whole time we were eating at our tables and there were people waiting for tables."}
{"text":"Great fast service!!! Only waited about 5mins to be seated...A1 SERVICE...very convenient since we were staying at the Stratosphere...right out the back door:)"}
{"text":"Its a good place to eat, good food friendly staff, but always a little slow on refills"}
{"text":"It's a Denny's... So you pretty much know what you're going to get. That being said, I really enjoy the people who work here! They're always really fun and they know they're on a college campus so they don't bullshit you.   If you're hungry, broke, on campus, and short on time, this place will be fine."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience while staying out of town with my family.  The diner was understaffed.  Service was extremely slow.  The food was slow coming out and cold when we got it.  We are a family of 5 , and no 2 of us got our food at the same time.  They were out of ham which is odd for a place that pushes their breakfast menu.  Drink service was almost nonexistent.  It is no wonder they weren't busy on a Friday night at supper time, that actually should have been a clue."}
{"text":"Took 30 min to get seated and all the seats were empty . Food came in 40 min after seating . Merry Christmas guys"}
{"text":"I was so happy this location open! Means I didnt have to travel far to have Denny's, however, I was not impressed. We went on a night where it was not busy at all. Our server was not friendly with us in the beginning. And just asked for our drinks, not even a hello, can I take your drink order? I kind of felt she was kind of rude. Then, we got our drinks and took us  five mins to placed our order. We waited for like  ten mins before our food came. On the bright side, the food was good. Could be a warmer though. Love the design of the place. Probably will come back."}
{"text":"Tired of the $20 mediocre breakfasts and $25 salads throughout Las Vegas, I decided to do something totally different for breakfast one day... so off to Denny's!  I'm not too familiar with the Denny's chain so I don't know how this location compares to others so keep that in mind if you read my review.  I was by myself for the SEMA show in town, so I was hoping to just get a seat with counter service.  Well, that didn't happen because they don't have any bar/counter service.  No big deal, I was seated at a table after a 10 minute wait.  The service was definitely not top notch but I didn't expect it to be.  My waiter was friendly enough, I'm not too picky.  However, the coffee was not hot and tasted watery.     I liked how I was able to create my own \"Grand Slam\" because I was on a special diet for my physical training and being able to pick all items with limited carbohydrates was a welcome option.  You know how hard it is to find food when dining out with minimal carbohydrates?... VERY.  The food was not bad, but definitely not very good.  However, only spending $12 for a big breakfast was a nice change.  While I was eating, one of the employees brought out a really noisy vacuum for about 15 minutes just to vacuum up some crumbs.  It was a little annoying after 5 minutes, more annoying after 10 minutes, and REALLY annoying after 15 minutes.  I don't know how other restaurants do it but I've never had to eat out with a vacuum in my ear."}
{"text":"Wife:  To start, we arrived at 8am and were seated right away.  Absolutely no waiting.  The waitress, Tanya, provided great service!  She was pleasant and promptly took our breakfast orders.  She had a great sense of humor when my son, Marco asked if she can guarantee that the pancakes are 40% fluffier!   Her response was, \"we have the fluffiest pancakes in town!\"  I ordered blueberry pancakes with eggs and bacon.  Robert devoured his cinnamon bun pancakes.  Upon seeing his plate, I was ready to nab some of his breakfast!!! Marco and Charlie quickly scarfed down their pancakes as well!   We absolutely enjoyed our breakfast and service.  Thank you Robert for suggesting Denny's for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Not only did they not have strawberry milk shakes because they don't have a blender but they have it in the menu but they also didn't have pecan pie, don't put it on the menu if you won't have it. Smh."}
{"text":"Wow. I've been to some Denny's, and don't get me wrong, some of them are awesome...but THIS Denny's, in the Sandman Calgary West Hotel, is TOTALLY AWESOME.   Ok, so tonight, I had a prime rib, sizzling stirfry, with mashed potatoes, cheese, bacon, broccoli and sour cream. Oh my God, wow!!! I thought Denny's was just supposed to be a place that is open late. The food here totally changes everything. It's REALLY good.   That's the thing, I've eaten at really expensive places before, and I don't get it. I had that meal tonight, with an orange juice AND a slice of yummy chocolate cake for under $20. Like, how is that possible? I can't go to the supermarkert and buy that stuff, uncooked, and cook it myself for anything close to that price, and it certainly would not taste awesome like it does at Denny's.   Ok, I also had the grand slam for breakfast, and wow, was it good. Like that's the thing...there are so many choices on the Grand Slam, it's basically 'build your own breakfast', any way you want. I sometimes got pancakes (especially the awesome pumpkin pie pancakes they had over the holidays), with whipped cream, sausages, bacon. Lately, like today, I've been getting oatmeal, with brown sugar, bacon, sausages (can you tell I like bacon and sausages?), warm buttermilk biscuits with butter, and usually orange juice to go with it. Everything is totally awesome, but the buttermilk biscuits...oh my God, they're just too good. I mean, I COULD probably eat about six of them, but I usually try to limit my daily intake to two. :)  I had two bowls of oatmeal this morning because I was off to the gym for a few hours, and even though I went through 8 excercises, 45 minutes of cardio and maybe 20 minutes of yoga, I wasn't hungry at all by the time Ieft the gym. That's the thing...the breakfast, well actually, all the food here is really healthy. I don't put garbage in my body, so that's why I eat at Denny's. I like the 'Livestrong' idea of eating before and after a workout, and Denny's has really healthy food. My breakfast was about $13, which is unbelievable. I have a feeling I might be eating at Denny's a lot more often.   Now I really want to mention the staff. A place doesn't get 5 stars on food alone. Yeah, the food is awesome, but the people that work here are really nice. They remember my name, they ask me how I am, they talk and joke with me, and they even remember what I like to eat. I've tried lots of things on the menu...the delicious roast (yeah, I know, roast, I can't believe it either), the awesome fish, the prime rib or chicken sizzling stirfry's, like, everything was really good. What I don't get is, how do they remember everything? They don't even seem to write it down. Whoa, that's good.  Like, on the weekends, people sometimes stop here on their way to the mountains, or on their way to Canada Olympic Park. Sometimes the place has been kind of busy when I've been here, but the staff are still friendly. I know I would be frazzled if I had to deal with so many people, or I'd be running away, yet they're joking with me and are really friendly. The manager makes time to stop by and say hi. If it's not too busy, and even when it's moderately busy, I can choose pretty much where I want to sit, and they always seem to have the day's paper. I've even had it brought to me a few times. Wow, now that's awesome.   This place gets 5 stars because the people AND the food are totally awesome. Thank you for so many awesome meals. You guys rock."}
{"text":"Ok, my last review was not the best for this Denny's. So since everything else was busy for breakfast on Sunday, we decided to come over again. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated. I have noticed new staff and the some of the old staff that were actually good stayed.   The food looks better and taste better. The services was wonderful and very surpring. I will make this one of the regular spots just for the service we recieved from Yota."}
{"text":"On the plus side, the service gets an A+ ... the staff were like holdovers from a bygone era of helpfulness. Great variety on the menu as well. Unfortunately, the food is greasy and disappointing."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in with the Home Depot on the SE corner of McDowell and 75th Ave, just North of I-10.  The restaurant was clean and nice.  The hostess/cashier could have been friendlier, she seemed to have no enthusiasm for her job.  Our waitress however, more than made up for her.  Our waitress was friendly, bubbly, and smiled a lot.  She took really good care of us.  She even stopped to give quick attention to a baby sitting at the next table.  The food was what you'd expect from a Denny's chain.  It was good.  The entire staff came out to sing happy birthday to two different tables and that made the kids smile and squeal with joy.  I was happy to see the staff with that energy.  I enjoyed my visit and will go back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Scrambled eggs and hash browns, bacon. Hit the spot. All employees pleasant and accommodating.  My 76 Birthday is tomorrow and they honored me with a. Free Grand Slam breakfast. Because I am missing my family in PA, the waitresses sang Happy Birthday to me"}
{"text":"Will never go here again. They are truly hiring anyone with no knowledge, experience. Me and my husband went in around 7 no one to greet us so we waited a few till someone lifted their heads and opened their eyes. Was seated and waited for our server that took another 5 minutes mind you it wasn't that busy. Finally she came over asked what we would like to drink and she will be right back with our drinks. Guess what 5 minutes later because she was taking an order of patrons who just came in after us. Ok we finally get our drinks and placed our order. We wait and wait and the patrons who came in after us gets their food first. I got up and asked for the manager and told him the issue and said sorry we won't be dining. He said it's coming out now we told them keep it he said don't worry about the sodas it's on him I said you are absolutely right on that. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Well the place is kinda run down and there was a large hole in the vinyl of my seat, but thats not why they got one star. They got one star because my plate was filthy with dried on food. I got the chicken fried steak with broccoli and mashed p. There should be nothing RED on my plate, yet there was dried on marinara (obviously made it through the dish wash machine)....so I spent a few minutes deciding what to do and I move the chicken and there is more dried on food. This was OBVIOUS AND LARGE, I mean how do you pick up a plate to put food on it and NOT NOTICE BRIGHT RED DRIED ON FILTH??? so I set my plate aside and watch my GF eat.  I dont want the food replaced, this has turned my stomach. The waiter comes and takes my plate and assures me it will be taken care of, then the bill comes and nothing is comped except the plate WHICH I DID NOT EAT A BITE FROM. When someone messes up that badly, I expect at least to have my GFs meal, or the drinks comped. Nothing. Next time I will walk out right when that nasty food was served, which was our first intuition. SO THEN, we go to check out and the waiter tells me we cant use our military discount because we already used our discount by returning the disgusting food. This about made my head spin, so I had to argue with him till he miraculously discovered that he could indeed still give us our military discount. Needless to say I will never come back. Had the manager bothered to come address the issue and appologize instead of just glaring at me from across the restaurant I would have given 2 stars. Had the manager comped the meal I would have skipped a negative review. Needless to say, I will never return here."}
{"text":"This Denny's is great. I come here all the time and never write a review. Tonight I went to another Denny's that was horrible and I wanted to at least give this place credit. The manager is always super nice and the waiters and waitresses are all nice and fast. I've been here probably 20 times and never had an issue. Always good food and great service."}
{"text":"The food tasted good, but everything else about dinner tonight was awful.   The waitress forgot some of our food and didn't bring my order to me the way I asked. After that, she brought us the check and refilled our drinks, but then we never saw her again. After a while I was thirsty enough that I literally got up, went behind the counter and refilled our drinks myself. No one noticed. After about an hour a new waitress came by and offered refills -- leaving our two empty dirty cups on the table but finally removing the dirty dishes. Over the course of more than two hours we were never asked if we wanted to order anything else. To top it off, two of the stalls in the women's restroom were completely out of toilet paper."}
{"text":"Good pricing, standard menu. The Grand Slam combo was fantastic and offered a lot of healthful options. And cab fare from Luxor was about $8, which was reasonable-ish."}
{"text":"Horrible....horrible.....horrible!!! Don't waste ur money!!! Bad and slow service with an empty restaurant. Unbelievable, I should've know."}
{"text":"Went in after placing a on demand order and had received email confirmation that our food was ready. Manager on duty Christy tells us our order never went through and they took an extra 15 min to make our food. Manager never apologized about it or waitress who gave us our food didn't say a word. WORST experience at this place. Will not be dining there ever again."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. Neither great nor bad. I don't usually go to Denny's, because there are so many good restaurants near where I live. Since  I'm from out of town and this one was only a 5 minute walk I had nothing too lose. The wait to be seated wasn't bad, as the place was packed, so it wasn't a big deal. But the service was SLOW. Too slow for a just a okay  breakfast. If you're from another country and  you're looking to try an American style breakfast for the first time, look somewhere else first. But if you don't mind a wait and mediocrity or it's been a late night and you're on the way back from a night out on the town, this may be the place for you."}
{"text":"So I order a simple breakfast. Just some eggs toast and bacon. I asked for the toast with no butter and bacon crispy. When I got the food. There was heavy butter on my toast and bacon soggy and they put hash brown. I told them my food was wrong. The guy who delivered the food was rude and said give me your plate and our waiter was laughing.  Another gentlemen stepped in and helped us and was kind. Kevin I believe was his name.  And was apologizing for them. The service sucked. What a way to put a damper on our day in Vegas.  Thru the time we were seated til we left. Our waiter was no where to be found. Never will eat here again"}
{"text":"The only reason I did not give this place a 5, is it in dire need of a remodel.  I swear the women's restroom has original everything...Could use a good cleaning.  The waitress Patayna was very sweet & food was good. (a lil' cold) I'll be back"}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast twice on my last trip to Las Vegas. Early in the week, Tuesday, it was crowded but no wait. On Friday there was a wait, but less than 15 minutes. The place is noisy.  Service on both visits could have been better. Being busy is no excuse for ignoring customers. I almost had to tackle a waitress to get a 2nd cup of coffee.  Waited forever to get our food and the toast didn't come with the meal and had to wait again for that.  Food is good and the prices aren't too bad."}
{"text":"Went to this Denny's last night with my brother. I got the steak and eggs. I must admit for the price it was very good. We also had a very good waitress. I recommend this Denny's"}
{"text":"I have gotten used to bad service at the Denny's by my house, so we have been coming to this one. Tonight ended that. We waited for 10 minutes to have our drink order taken, ordered at that time and waited 10 minutes for salads (instead of fries)that came out wrong. Food came out except my sons and waitress said she'd be right back with it. He still hadn't gotten it when the majority of our table was DONE eating. He's 11. The waitress NEVER came to check on us. She NEVER communicated that the manager, who was cooking, dropped his order and that is why it was taking forever. Nothing. I made them comp our entire meal because I was PISSED. I'm done with Denny's."}
{"text":"Reasonable. It's Denny's, what can you say? Greasy spoon, open late diner that hits the spot if you're starving or have been drinking. I was starving and had been drinking, though not nearly enough to say the food really hit the spot. There must have been soy in my cheesy bacon fries or whatever it was but not soy protein so it was a long, slow-acting release of the \"WTF-was-I-thinking!?\" response."}
{"text":"The service is ok but the food is not worth it.  Found a 10 inch strand of hair in my food!! Gross"}
{"text":"It's been a very long time when I have gone to a restaurant and had exceptional service and fabulous food but this Denny's was exceptional. Our waitress, Vesaun, was fabulous and I couldn't have asked for better service.  I ordered breakfast and it was cooked to perfection. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This is the worst Denny's I have ever been into and I've been to some petty bad Denny's. Firstly, it takes approximately 10 minutes to even be acknowledged when you walk into the door. And even then you get treated like you aren't even a person when you do get acknowledged. And don't even bother ordering a to go order, you MIGHT get it an hour later. Everyone including the manager runs around like they have no idea what they are doing. It's like they hire people without training them and then just put them on the floor. If I could rate this place negative stars I would."}
{"text":"Mateo was our server and he did an amazing job! Food and price was great!:)  We definitely will be back when we're on this side of town! I got the Grand Slam Slugger my handsome boyfriend got Moons Over My Hammy and my son ordered Grand Slamwhich ...all yummy!"}
{"text":"Just went there for a free birthday grand slam. The place was clean. Tamarra was one of the best waitresses ever. The food was delicious. The only knock is that my phone rejected their wifi as too slow."}
{"text":"The service and food were good, however they had the air conditioner in a freezing cold temperature, that everybody inside was complaining... they said that it was cause the kitchen gets too hot! But really? Don't they have an air conditioner for the kitchen and another for the clients! It was horrible to stay inside"}
{"text":"Received a free build your own grand slam today for my birthday (sign up now for yours) so went with my beautiful wife for brunch. We tried the white chocolate raspberry pancakes which were surprisingly fluffy and delicious. I also had some bacon, French toast and scrambled eggs with hash browns. Good 4/5 overall for the meal. Thanks for the quick service and filling brunch."}
{"text":"Waited for over 15 minutes to get a table when I could see there was more than 8 tables available. I sat there for a while and no one was kind enough to ask for our order. Worst management ever!!!!!! I've been to Other Denny's WAAAAY MUCH BETTER!  This one SUCKSSS!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this location, and I've been coming here since it opened (not sure what the other reviews are talking about). We have a few favorite servers we ask for by name.    If we try something that isn't great, we let them know. But that is rare.  And usually if we try something new they are promoting, the servers will tell you if it is a good item or not so good (so if you aren't sure, ask them).   The servers are always attentive and fun. They take care of us and really do great with our 5 yr old."}
{"text":"yes.... Denny's....  what red blooded American hasn't had the joy of the Grand Slam?  If you find one, please drag them to a Denny's at once!!!  Ok... Enough about that and let's talk about this one restaurant...   highlights include: amply parking, typical menu, same well known and worn decor, consistent good quality....    lowlights include: front door faces street without any reasonable regard to where any off the ample parking is located, waitresses that seem to be a bit overloaded and can't seem to actually stop at the table for any reason, when they do stop to take your order they stand behind you even thought you are in a both with the end open.  Now just plain weird... I'd you are paying with a credit card, you have to write your tip and total on the slip ¬∞ before¬∞ you hand it and your card to the cashier...  If this is a \"chip\" thing, then fine, but since I do not use a card with a chip, this is just weird!  This Denny's location is really the best thing about it... Everything else seems just to be the same corporate blandness of any other Denny's ANYWHERE!"}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't even review a chain breakfast/lunch place but I felt our breakfast there this past week warranted a review, and a good one at that. We originally decided to eat here because I had a 20% off coupon, BTW on your actual DOB you can walk in show ID and get a free meal.  We ordered some standard breakfast fare, I having the classic style with eggs over easy hash browns, two sausage links and two pieces of bacon with a cup of coffee.  My husband got similar except he got pancakes as well.    No the food at Denny's is not outstanding, nor have I ever yearned to go eat there, but I have to give a shout out to our server who I believe his name was Andre.  I am sorry if I am off, so I apologize if I am mistaken.  Andre was super upbeat, friendly, attentive, and very helpful.  Him and my husband were having such a friendly conversation I was thinking wow he could be like his new BFF...  Anyhow he is why I wanted to write the review to let the Monroeville location know what a great asset he is to their team.  Oh and the food wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Modern and comfortable inside. It has free wifi. Easy menu selections for building your own tasty and healthy breakfast. Prices are very reasonable. The staff is friendly and courteous. I love the relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. We haven't been to a Denny's in a few months because the last Denny's we went we got no service and left. So we've been hitting wafflehouse and IHOP. This last Thursday my son and husband really wanted Denny's. So we tried this Denny's hoping to have a better experience. We got sat down, there was only one other table in our section that was already eating. Got our drinks right away. 10-15 minutes later they sat someone 2 tables behind us. 10-15 minutes later someone came and took there order and no one had ever come to our table except the person that brought us our drinks as soon as we sat down.   I work hard for my money and only get to treat my family out to dinner twice a month, so we left and went to Wafflehouse where we served promptly! I'm so disappointed in Denny's."}
{"text":"I hadn't been back since my last review in 2014. My son convinced me to try it again about 2 months ago. We have now been back 3 times. The service has improved tremendously. Each time we've been back they have been very attentive, fast, and friendly. My food was fresh and great, with the occasional hiccup but no one is perfect. The last time we went back they had renovated the place and it looks great. I think you have renewed my faith in you Denny's!"}
{"text":"It is what it is,it's Denny's decent food, this particular location service with Karen was excellent!! On the ball coffee cup never empty she's fantastic"}
{"text":"Our Hostess, server, and busser Juanita was absolutely amazing. Juanita instantly put our drink orders and food in which was very appreciated. The skillets are my favorite I try to get a different one every-time I go."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from a Denny's! We went on a week day so it wasn't busy or anything. We got immediate service and they were super friendly and fast with us.   We went on my birthday which meant I got a free breakfast. It was the Original Slam or something like that. Being a vegetarian they let me substitute the meat options for vegetarian options, which was awesome!"}
{"text":"Honestly, pretty disappointed with the management at this location. The store was pretty busy with only two servers, one of whom was brought back from break early, while the manager often disappeared or stood around. The kitchen timing was off, the food arrived cold, and there was no one providing guidance for the kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars. Every person in here is working really hard. However, the MVP here is the manager (Dark skinned guy with a mustache in case there are several). Anyways, he's not afraid to get in there and help take orders and bring drinks. These servers are lucky to have a manager do this for them. Also, food was good and cheap and for a low carb eater - I got exactly what I wanted and everyone is still smiling despite how busy it is."}
{"text":"By far the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. The first time was during Christmas so I decided to give them a second chance a couple months later. Still equally slow, forgot parts of our meal and then asked if we still wanted what they forgot to bring??? Servers are lazy and don't want to be there, they make it obvious."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Denny's in years and went to this one for breakfast this morning. Ugh. The \"fluffy\" pancakes had a rubbery feel like they had been in a steam table for awhile, the sausage links - what are they filled with? - were mushy.And the bacon-like strips they served, not crispy but gummy - like they were some kind of compressed pork product that resembles bacon. Even the toast = what can be bad about toast? Well, it it's made from stale bread, it ain't appetizing. Think it will be another few years before I hit a Denny's again."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly. Food is good quality. Huge selection. The pancake puppies are the best. Sharolette and Lenny are amazing servers. We come here a lot."}
{"text":"Staff is really rude.  The wait on the food takes forever and they usually get your order wrong.  Don't even think about getting your drink refilled. Worst place to eat.  Stay away"}
{"text":"9:45 on a Saturday morning and we had to wait 10/15 minutes for a table for 5.  When we were finally seated it was in a room by ourselves full of empty tables.  We had to wait for that?!  The hostess couldn't figure out how many adult menus we needed if we needed 3 kid menus.  Then she couldn't figure out how many silverware after that 2 adult menu and 3 kid menu debacle.    The service was so so slow.  I actually had to leave before the food arrived.  I will visit the Broadway/Priest or Baseline/I-10 location from now on."}
{"text":"It's located in the casino, so you have to walk through the wall of smoke to get to it.   That's a negative in my book.  Our waiter was good.  The wait time was average to get our food.  Food was warm in temperature, could have been hotter.  The environment was very loud and very busy.  I wouldn't go there again unless I couldn't find anything else."}
{"text":"Horrible service from Carla .. We politely tried to tell her about herself and she clapped back. So rude. Country fried steak is nasty , don't waste your time. The manager Marlin comped our order and made it right. Thankyou Marlin"}
{"text":"What do you do when you're in Whitby at 3am and your friend's new bachelor pad has no food? You apparently go to Denny's. I was starving and sleepy so my tolerance was really low. We just wanted to get some food and get out but the host was in a talkative, joking mood. Unfortunately his jokes were not funny.  He gave us the late night menu, which only had one omelette option on there. I asked him if I could get it without meat. He sighed and said that I might as well just get the veggie omelette. I told him I would IF it had been listed on the menu he gave me. He said, \"I'm only joking\". I asked for no hash browns and some sausage.  We received our orders and headed back to my friend's house. First thing we noticed was that we BOTH had hash browns. My omelette was okay but I wouldn't order it again. The only thing I loved were the sausages but good breakfast sausage can be devoured at other restaurants that would serve good breakfast as well.  Next time I'll know that when I'm up at 3am in Whitby, I need to drink some water and either go to bed or go back home to Toronto."}
{"text":"Ah, Denny's. The only time you visit is after spending an evening drinking since there is nothing else open... or if you want to eat Breakfast but the only thing close to your hotel is Denny's.   My fam and I came here the day of my graduation for a quick bite. This Denny's was the fastest one I have ever been to! We all had to share our food (and had leftovers) because the portions are abnormally large and cheap ($20 for four ppl). I can't imagine any person finishing a full meal by themselves. Even my bf and I shared one breakfast meal, we still felt so gross afterwards. Ah well, that's Denny's for ya! Good, greasy breakfast food."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with attentive and efficient servers...  Excellent selections on the menu and you can't beat the make your own Grand Slam!  Convenient and the prices are right."}
{"text":"It's Denny's.  Open 24 hours.  I mostly go for breakfast (Grand Slam) but they have good specials, too.  The price is right.  An alternative to Eat N Park (and right across the street).  There's really no surprises here.  You know what you're getting."}
{"text":"I was a starvin marvin by the time my friend and I reached Dennys last night.  It was not that busy...a few tables finishing up as we were parkin out butts in the booth. A couple of other new tables.   Obviously being night time, there was likely 1 cook and like 2 servers. Totally get that. However...service was a tad slow for busting out some breakfast. We only ordered the standard grand slams so it's not like anything had a long cook time.  Waiter was nice though and the food hit the spot. Bacon was nice and crispy.  French toast was just yum... granted I was drunk off my ass and hungry as all hell so I was shoveling that ish down my throat. ;)  The place was clean though and overall...a great Dennys. Id go to this one again."}
{"text":"Ruben, what on earth were you doing at Denny's?  Well it was late, we were hungry, and that was the closest things to my friends house.  We should've just gone to bed.  We roll up to this Denny's at about 3:30am.  I'll grant you, yes, it is 3:30am, I should wither my expectations.  Even with that in mind, I was still underwhelmed.  The big dip in this exp. was our server.  He was creepy, inattentive (hello, you have 2 tables, what's the deal?), and just plain awful.  My friends and I order our stuff- I got a slam burger (burger with egg and hashbrowns on it), and my friends get a lumber jack slam, and an ultimate omlette.  We started off with nacho cheese fries (they were chillie fries with sour cream and jalapenos basically).  When the order came up, they literally sat there for 5 minutes while our server proceeded to eat his own breakfast.  Our food comes out, maybe 15 minutes after that, and after we get our food, our server is gone for a good 20 minutes.  No follow up, no refills, just plain gone.  We seriously considered dine and dash after he was no where to be found for a good 10 minutes.  The kicker- their credit card machine was \"down\" so they only took cash.  Me thinks this guy was just pocketing the money.  Don't go to this Denny's late nite.  The server (who never introduced himself) will ruin it for you even more so than the fact that you made the decision to eat at a Dennys."}
{"text":"Horrible service. There's a lot of people waiting to be seated and a lot of people waiting for refills and their checks. Horrible place. This place went downhill!!"}
{"text":"So today I guess a server called out, and there was a shortage of waiters. So basically my wife's father is a diabetic and thought he'd get in there and enjoy a cup of coffee and orange juice before we got there. He sat there for 15 minutes before anybody saw him. When we showed up and he was sweating and feeling sick and his blood sugar was low and it sucked. So basically we sat here for about 5 minutes and finally the hostess came over and she was amazing. She got us drinks and she was very courteous and nice. She was amazing. We never had a complaint about this Denny's and today we had a little issue, but yeah. I'd just like them to recognize the hostess cause she is a star and she is amazing and she honestly was the sweetest person and kept apologizing and it was not at all her fault. It was just a timing error on the waitress and they need to be careful for diabetics who come in the future."}
{"text":"This Denny's is pretty decent. Staff is mainly friendly. Food isn't bad. Nothing horrible about this location and nothing outstanding. Just your average Denny's! I will say that the wait time for food is pretty long even when they aren't very busy."}
{"text":"Avoid coming here! I came in for lunch at 12:30pm and encounter myself not only with Bad service but also  ended up disgusted at the end. To start off I asked for a well done T-steak and while I ate one side cause it looked good the other side was all under cooked (rare) I seriously couldn't even finish that, the waiter asked if i wanted to have it placed back in the grill but with what happened with my husband I was like no thank you, I'll barf... Then, I would say bad service, because I had to ask for extra napkins and keep asking my server  for refills since the she was not on top of it at all!  lastly as my husband was eating his pancakes he noticed a long hair under the pancakes Sending him straight to the bathroom to barf it all up... With that said, the reason I gave one star is because they didn't charge me for my husband's lumberjack slam which isn't bad, although with all this they shouldn't have charged me for anything!!!   I Definitely do not a recommended place, and I will never set foot in this restaurant ever again!"}
{"text":"We checked in and waited 30 minutes seeing more than half the tables and boothes empty we asked why and found that the kitchen could not catch up with orders. There were people seated with drinks that had been waiting more than an hour for there food order. Needless to say we left and may not return unless we see an under new management sign. I will discourage everyone i can from going to this location. Better to drive father so the experience is better. If i could do zero stars i would. We went to IHOP got great service."}
{"text":"Hey, for the price you really cant beat Dennys.  Our family often gets the food to go and has it for dinner.  We like some of the other breakfast only places,but Dennys serves breakfast 24 hrs a day so its very convenient."}
{"text":"Dennys ALWAYS treats me right, but tonight was not a stellar evening.  Some of the staff had already been flustered about issues with Uber orders. Customers were mad, Uber drivers were mad, and Dennys had no excuses, however, that does not excuse for the experience that I had with my girlfriend tonight.  All I wanted was toast, eggs, sausage and juice.  The toast was wrong, the sausage was fine, the eggs were okay, but the hash browns were just shedded wet potato. Sent them back, and I got them back on the same plate, and a handful of excuses on how the grill works! Lastly, my orange juice had bubbles in it because it still had soap in the glass.  Dennys... come on, son."}
{"text":"Pretty good  and quite on a Thursday morning all is well with the food and spirits are peaceful"}
{"text":"Upon arrival there was a line which is understandable during mid morning. We were fully prepared to wait knowing there were five of us. Surprisingly, we were seated almost right away. Then our experience went downhill. We waited at our table for 10 minutes before a server (not ours) came over and offered to grab us drinks seeing that our server had not been over yet. Our server came over while the other gentleman grabbed our drinks and rudely asked what we wanted to drink. When we told her someone else was getting our drinks she didn't think twice about it and rudely continued to ask if we were ready to order. She was easily confused while we ordered even though we did not modify any orders. Once our food came 20 minutes later, she brought it out and walked away without asking if we needed anything. We were halfway done with our food before she finally came back over and asked if we needed anything. I asked for a refill on my orange juice. She rudely stated there wasn't free refills and I said that was okay. If I was worried about it I would have asked if there was free refills before ordering another. She brings over the bill and to no surprise she messed that up. She tried charging us for 3 coffees when we had only ordered one. The gentleman who brought our drinks over mistakenly grabbed two so when we questioned it she disgustedly said \"But you drank it\". Finally when the manager comes over, he gets confused as to which coffees to remove which mattered because we were paying separately. He decided to take off all of drinks because he couldn't figure it out. Never once did he apologize for the confusion or lack of service."}
{"text":"WHAT A DISASTER!!!! First of all i am a waiter myself ... waiter was rude so not caring..when me and boyfriend first got there the silver ware was dirty left over food stuck on there... Waited for our food.. My boyfriend's food was cold. HIS CUP WAS CHIPPED !!! (Uhhh hazardous) what if his 2 year old son drank out of that !! And cut his lip uhh no unacceptable.. Food was not presentable at all.. And as we are eating just trying to deal with that stuff two other tables next to us left complaining about the food  also... So my boyfriend was cutting into the center of his pancakes THERE WAS BATTER UNCOOKED.... DISGUSTING!!! The manager looked lost .. She looked like it was her first day.. omg just horrible never again!! Worst dennys in Arizona..."}
{"text":"for delivery: not order meat, it comes from very bad quality, raw and very greasy....... the milkshakes, hash browns and eggs was ok"}
{"text":"Love their breakfast selection. 20% off coupon when u sign up for e-mail list. Prices are good, great for single, or group gathering."}
{"text":"The longest wait I've ever had at a restaurant, and our food was still raw. The service was absolutely awful."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations.  I've been to some dodgy Dennys over the years, so my expectations were pretty basic.  But this place is great.  Here's what I like:  THE GOOD: - It's open and airy and surrounded by windows, emitting lots of outside light. - It's been remodeled fairly recently, so the colors and textures and surfaces are all modern and fresh. - The FOOD is really good.  Eggs are eggs, so I should say my food was prepared very well.  (For the record - I had one of the classic \"Slams,\" with your basic eggs, bacon, biscuit, and hash-browns.) - They've got a large, private parking lot.  THE BAD: - Nothing.  I like it, the service was good, the food was good, it was clean inside, and quick and easy."}
{"text":"Had clam chowder and rib Cobb salad. Clam chowder is cheap and not very good. Very salty and not creamy at all. Salad is okay. Dressing is a bit too sweet. Friends have other stuff such as chicken and sausage omelet and pancake. Really liked them. And milkshake is very tasty too."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Where do I begin with this place? We had a group of 5. We were seated but not given menus. One of us had to go up and ask for it. The server didn't greet us. She looked miserable. She only served one side of the table and told them to pass the items down to the others. The food was horrible. The pancakes were undercooked. The over-easy eggs were hard. The hash browns were cold. The bacon was floppy. The scrambled eggs were just clumps. And the bathrooms were filthy. If you're looking for a decent place to eat, don't eat here!"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had in years. 30 mins to get out ordered taken. After 40 mins waiting for the food we decided to cancel the order the waiter didn't even ask why just said \"okay\" we walked out and no one bothered to say sorry for the wait or anything"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to a skillet but this restaurant was filthy! I should've taken a picture of just the entry way. I usually judge a restaurants cleanliness by what I see when I walk in but I was hungry haha. After waiting for two minutes to be seated (No one else in line) it gave us enough time to see the kitchen and broken light fixture over the breakfast bar and the dirty dining room we decided this was not the place we will be eating. You all need to clean that place up! I'd be embarrassed to work there or call myself the owner."}
{"text":"The hostess was friendly and all-smiles. But this location is very dirty. There was a fly in my drink and when i brought it up to my server, ingrisg or 224 (as registered on my receipt), she apologized but never came back to serve or talk to us about it. Our check was handed by another server. That was a very unprofessional call especially if i wasn't rude when i pointed out the fly. Will not go back to this location again."}
{"text":"All I can say is, the waitress named Barbara is a standard by which many waitresses should base their professionalism upon following in her footsteps. Im just saying that when she's at work she's always makes the decision to eat at Dennys over IHOP which is down the street. Seem like the best decision made in deciding where to eat. My order is always just how i orderd it and she acts as if I'm important to her."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for years and it looks great! Good breakfast selection I almost got the egg whites and Spanish but then I saw the blueberry pancakes :-)"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Not only did the cook get our order wrong twice, but the waitress was rude and abrupt with giving out drinks, food, and bill. it took about 10 minutes for my family of five to get seated... BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS HALF FULL. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Great place for a morning in sweats. Like the fact that you can get a quality meal for $8. Don't ask for coffee though, the $2 drink leaves something to be desired. Staff was slow, but friendly, so I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"I had eaten here 2 times previously and the service and food were both good   This time , not so much. . My food was ok but not as hot. My server was a space cadet. She rushed me to order and when I asked for hot sauce and also asked for extra water for my tea bag I got neither.   Her tip reflected my displeasure. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Are at this Denny's late on a Saturday evening. All the staff was very friendly.  They definitely have some kinks to work out.  I do not like to try a new place until they have been open a few months for that reason.  But it was late and our options were limited. My husband and I both enjoyed our food.  The service was slow, but as I said, they do need to work out a few things. Our food was very good.  The restaurant was clean.  We will definitely give them another chance!  I had the Philly cheesesteak, my husband had a bourbon bacon burger.  Both really good!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. The last time I was at this location it took for ever for the waitress to bring us coffee. We were a party of 5 and she kept bringing one plate at a time. Everyone had their food except one of the persons in our table. 20 minutes later the last plate arrives. We asked for napkins and utensils and it took like 10 minutes for her to bring them to us. Never going back to this location"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, this is my neighborhood Denny's. Called to get a pickup order started. I was on hold for over ten minutes! When I called back I got a busy signal for over 3 minutes. Just dissapointed"}
{"text":"One of the best Denny's I've been to in a while. We were helped right away and received service in a timely manner. The food came out hot and fresh. We ordered breakfast platters (ultimate skillet) and was very delicious. I would recommend this Denny's as a great place to relax and enjoy your time with company."}
{"text":"I think the $4 Pancakes (2), Eggs, and 2 pieces of Bacon or Sausage (You choose One) is one of the best deals in town! The Value Menu is separate then the regular menu! It is usually placed next to the salt and pepper, but if you don't see it, ask the waitress!  If $2 is too much to spend, they even have $2 menu items!! Its as cheap or cheaper then McDonalds, except you can rest easy knowing you are at a RESTAURANT, not a Fast Food place that has a \"Character\" called \"The Grimace!\"   As for the Restaurant, the decor is OK, and since this is a \"Denny's Diner\" they play VERY OLD Music from the 50's!  Are you like me and enjoy eating a Delicious Breakfast while listening to music where all the artists have passed away?  Then this is the place for YOU!"}
{"text":"Such slow service. I normally love Moons Over My Hammie, but here, it lacked an real flavor. Felt Like I was eating a cardboard box sandwich. Order seasoned friedls, took one taste and never at the rest. Waiter was ok. Over all, disappointed in Dennys."}
{"text":"Was hesitant due to review history but in reality ended pleasantly surprised. Service was good, food was prepared timely and as expected. Facility was clean. Not many people dining for dinner thus minimum staffing on hand, but there were no issues. Server was very polite and accommodating. Kids eat free for dinner (taken off bill at register). Kids Mac and cheese w side of fruit and a jr shake. Country fried steak dinner and honey jalape√±o burger. All food was good and prepared and served timely. Our experience was positive at this restaurant which would prompt a return visit."}
{"text":"Girl on Saturday they have one server and one cook. No host. I'm over Denny's right now"}
{"text":"Sigh.   Just don't.  We all anxiously awaited the next installment of \"what restaurant are they going to put here for 18 months or less\" after the Chinese buffet at this location closed down.  The news that it was going to be a Denny's got a resounding \"meh\", but those of us that work in the area were happy to have something new.  We got there for an early lunch, were greeted by a friendly, if not slightly frazzled, manager, and seated.  And then the wait began.  Many minutes later, our soft-voiced waitress took our order. More waiting for food.  Maybe 10 other tables were seated, far from busy, even after peak lunch time.  There is a TV hanging on the wall - I would point that away from the kitchen as they seemed more interested in the highlights from last night's Panthers game than doing their job in any sort of efficient manner (although last night's win over the Patriots was awesome).  My order of a Grand Slam Waffle breakfast took forever.  My bacon and eggs got to the table first and I was told the waffle would be out momentarily.  I finished the bacon and eggs, which were both what I was expecting and served the purpose, and was still waiting on the waffle.  Finally, my hard, dry waffle got to the table with a small dollop of butter and a small container of syrup.  I am usually just a butter only gal, but the waffle was bleh so I drowned it in syrup, which was immediately absorbed and somehow it was still dry.  The manager was scrambling around rather harried. The wait staff all seemed to be inexperienced or... something, I am not sure, no one was exactly throwing down their A game, or even their D game.  Lunch shouldn't take an hour at Denny's - we didn't pick it for the fine dining, we picked it because we needed a semi-quick lunch. I don't think the place sucks for lack of trying, but if they don't pull it together, it will be another RIP restaurant at this location."}
{"text":"Ugh!!!! Terrible service!!!! An hour wait...it's not packed.. Brought the food out without any utensils...get the utensils five minutes later. They acted like we were bothering them! Messed up two of the four orders! Food is swimming in oil. Yick. I know it's Denny's and not  Ruth Chris' but dang!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most inefficient Dennys I have ever been to. Waited 20 minutes before having to find someone to take out drink order then another 10 minutes to get a coffee, OJ and water. Had the waitress take our ores right away then waited another 45 minutes to get it. Good didn't come out all together,still waiting for other half of our order and what did come out is cold.   Ridiculous wait times. They know their Sunday rush times and should accommodate with additional staff. Won't ever be back to this dennys."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with my boobear because we wanted some \"american\" breakfast! I was pretty hesitant because I always check out reviews on YELP, before I go anywhere! And the 3 stars was scarin' me man, but we reaaaally just wanted some food so went anyways!  We walked in, were politely greeted by the host, and were promptly seated. It was about 9am and wasn't too busy at all, a few customers here and there.The host asked us if we wanted drinks and handed us our menus, very nice guy! The waitress, her name was Debra I believe, was very nice and always checking up on us to make sure we were okay!   Food took quite a while to arrive, maybe about a 15 minute wait. Who can cook food that fast anyways? No biggie. The food itself was delicious. I ordered the chicken and avocado sandwich, with french fries on the side, not bad~ I also ordered the $2 pancakes from the value menu, it was okay, a bit on the dry side though!  The boyfriend ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and zesty nachos. He liked his grilled cheese, and man the nachos were da BOMB.  Pretty cool that they're open 24 hours, that's always a plus! And OH, they have BACON everything! Bacon burgers, bacon desserts, bacon shakes! I personally hate bacon but if you like bacon, check it out!  Overall our total price wasn't that bad either! Will probably come back again to try out other things on the menu! :-)"}
{"text":"This place used to be great but lately I'm not sure what's going on. We visit here frequently on Tuesdays since kids eat free. The orders have been wrong, the waitresses don't check back for refills, and the food takes forever to come. Also, the waitresses like to gather and talk about their weekends and such out in the dining room for everyone to hear. We've moved our past few Tuesay dinner dates down the road to the other Dennys. Its been a much better experience."}
{"text":"The food was ok, however the coffee was crappy along with the service. Asked the waitress for a hot cup of coffee because as everyone in my table pointed out it was old and cold. What I got was attitude from the waitress who said that was the hottest it got, then asked, are you going to drink it or do you want water? That was my first experience as a first time visitor to Cleveland. I should of walked or at least spoken to the supervisor."}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero I would. Second time my family and I go to this location and for the second time we walked out. Bad service and after an hour of waiting for the food to arrive we left. Never again would we go to this location and do not recommend it to anyone. During our wait our drinks didn't get refilled and no apologies or explanations given for the wait."}
{"text":"Fast service, food was good. Service was great. The host was very attentive and assisted with getting our order fast so we could catch our flight.  Kids loved the chocolate chip pancakes and my egg white scrambled was delicious too"}
{"text":"Won't ever get old, breakfast all day any day for me. Prices are average, but the best thing about it is the hours, open 24 hours so you can literally drop in anytime!"}
{"text":"\"Im sorry hunny, our computer cut off your order... im putting it in now.\"  Seriously? Your computer can't handle 6 orders?   25 mins to get a chicken burger.... my whole group was done eating by the time i got my food.      THANKS"}
{"text":"That was the worst experience I've had in a long time. Waitress had four tables already served could not greet us with a good morning all she said was it'll be a while.... after 15 minutes of not being seated or even offered coffee we got up and left... no one was even visible other than the patrons. SMH. Very disappointed.. shame on you Denny's for hiring poor, unfriendly help"}
{"text":"Slow service but the food came out fast.  Its difficult to get a refill on coffee. Food was average for a Dennie's   The people watching was amazing here at 800 am. Hookers thugs and gangsters. This Dennie's is located smack in the middle of a truck stop casino/ seedy days inn."}
{"text":"We got married in February at Vegas Weddings a few blocks away. We decided to take our party to Denny's for dinner reception and then they could pick out what they would like for dinner. I had called ahead of time and made arrangements with their wedding coordinator to have our reception there.  We purchased the wedding package which included a secluded area of the restaurant and right next to the bar.  I had a cake delivered from The Baking Cup.... Everyone had a great time, we had the best waitress and waiter (Kaz and her son Jordan). Thank you for making our night great!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was great. Service was good. My food was warm, but my scrambled eggs were hot. I had the grand slam which if you ask for scrambled eggs you get shredded cheese. I asked for no cheese and usually other Denny's forgets and gives me cheese in my scrambled eggs. But, this location gave me cheese free eggs. It wasn't super busy, but it was busy. So I'm grateful cause I don't like cheese in my eggs. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"So, one day before work I was craving a Grand Slamwich and I decided to order one from this Denny's and I would pick it up on my way to work. I was told it would be 15 minutes and I said that would be fine. I ended up getting to Denny's exactly 20 minutes after ordering and was told that the order was not ready yet. I waited a few more minutes until the order was ready (not really a big deal at this point) and I left without checking the food so I could be at work on time. When I got to work and started to unbox my Slamwich, I noticed that it was really french toast, bacon, and eggs instead. I called Denny's and told them about the mix up. The manager told me that I have two options at this point. The first option was to come back to the Denny's and get a new Slamwich. This was out of the question because I work in Cleveland Heights. The other option was for the manager to take my name and number and I could order a Slamwich at a later date with no charge. I accepted option number two and I figured I would just order from Denny's again when I had another craving for it. Fast forward to this morning, I had another craving for Denny's so I figured I would order my free Slamwich and bring it to work. When I called I got one of the other managers on the phone and explained to them the situation I have just explained above. I was told that without anything in writing I would not be able to redeem a free Slamwich. So not only did I not get my money back for the wrong order, I didn't even get my food replaced with the correct food. I would strongly suggest anyone considering going to this Denny's to reconsider. There are plenty of other breakfast choices within a few minutes of this Denny's."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with 6 of my kids and we experienced the best service ever with our server/waiter/bus person Angel! He had great suggestions and made great conversation. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Five stars for a Denny's?  My God Jim, have you lost your mind!!  This is a good Denny's, but it's still Denny's.  Nothing really outstanding or bad, just your regular basic Denny's experience done well.  Congrats to the owner for running a nice, solid Denny's."}
{"text":"Hard to screw up.   Everything tasted good. Coffee was good.  Bad smell coming up from restroom floor drains?  Server Gayle was pleasant my mug was always full. Trying to cash out was an issue left it with server I tried to cash out twice."}
{"text":"I'm nor really going to rate the food because most Denny's are the same. The service here was great though. Everyone was friendly and I saw the manager check in a few times with her staff to see if they were doing okay and if she needed to help them with anything. Proof that good management goes a long way"}
{"text":"Ordered A Super Bird it was horrible soggy bread not toasted and no tomatoes. The second one came the same way. My waitress Cynthia told me i didn't need to get at attitude with her. She was rude to start with when we sat down she acted like she was doing us a favor."}
{"text":"This Denny is located near Costco's. Staff noted this place opened a year ago replacing a buffet restaurant. Really like the lighting and the decorations of this particular Denny's, been to some that were designed quite differently.  The waitress was warm and helpful with meal selection. It was like 3 PM and I did not want to have dinner nor breakfast. Even though the pumpkin pancake looks yummy on the menu. No sandwiches or burgers. Decided to go for the Chicken Quesadilla with sausage. Very tasty and a nice spicy kick to it with the sausage.   Denny is always adding new items on their menu which I like. Recall, last year traveling during the Christmas holidays and many places were closed on Christmas, but Denny's was open."}
{"text":"It's Denny's!   I ordered a double cheeseburger and had them put avocado and a fried egg on top and called it a night!"}
{"text":"I ordered over the phone I've done it before with no problems .however this time the girl on the phone seemed to be in a rush to hang up when I decided to cancel a previous meal that I had ordered she yelled back to the kitchen or whoever \"cancel that, they dont know what they want! \" i was able to hear everything. When i picked up my food and brought it home, there were no forks, butter, or syrup for my kids pancakes. My food was cold and my sandwhich was soggy. I myself work in the food business and that was just unnecessary horrible customer service.  Its your job, you get paid for doing. SO DO IT RIGHT OR DONT DO IT AT ALL. All together our breakfast was terrible. We wont be going back"}
{"text":"Customer service was atrocious. Just unacceptable. When my family and I arrived, we were the only ones waiting upfront, yet it took about 5 minutes for anyone to seat us. I was ready to leave but I noticed there was only one waitress so we stayed to give her a chance. After she seats us and gives us menus, she essentially ignored us the rest of the time. We waited about 12 minutes then left. She never even took our drink orders. I'm in the customer service industry so I understand there were other patrons (5 other tables), HOWEVER don't just ignore people who are trying to be understanding of your situation, that's disrespectful. When we walked out, neither the waitress or her manager (who were having a casual conversation at the bar) said anything to us, though they saw us. We will NEVER be back to this location."}
{"text":"Went to Denny's this morning. Took 40 minutes to get our food. Plates were hot but food was like warm. My wife only got one glass of tea and could not get a refill. I only had two cups of coffee, waiter kept telling me he would come back with more but never did. I only had pancakes and my wife had oatmeal and took 40 minutes. Had to ask for bill  from another waiter. This is the third time we have had this kind of service here. Will probably not be back. Avoid this Denny's. I could have driven to Tuscola to the better Denny's there, ate and driven back in the time it took to get my food."}
{"text":"We arrived 9:50 from castles and coasters. Maybe 3 tables already seated. We get seated asked our drink orders.  10 minutes later the waitress comes by verifies our drink order. Wrong. Corrected. There's two of us. Not rocket science. Our drinks arrive. She leaves. 10 minutes later another waitress comes for our order. 20 minutes later I flag down our waitress. I tell her we've been there 40 minutes. Apologizes says they had a big to go order. At this point I'm thinking the kitchen has issues. When we get our food my grandsons sandwich is burnt and fried are stuck together. Mine has about one third of the fillings shown in the pic. Fries tasted like they were cooked in old oil. I'm livid. My grandson doesn't want me to send it back. He's kind of shy and We we're starving at this point. Emphatically do not go here. Mismanaged. Horrible service. Horrible food. Seriously. Don't go. Plenty of other places nearby. We were wishing we'd have just done fast food instead. After we left I had some m&m peanuts in my purse. We stuffed our mouths trying to get the nasty oil taste out of our mouths. Keep driving. Don't stop. Worst restaurant experience in my life. The manager should be ashamed."}
{"text":"We really do live in a world that has absolutely no issue wasting your time and talent. To all my friends who are police officers I apologize for our society's inability to contain the knowledge of knowing when you should be called upon. A manager at Dennys just summoned the police on me to have me removed from the establishment. My cousins are in town from California and after an eventful fun night of dancing we worked up an appetite. After waiting for over 30 minutes while others who showed up after us were seated she offered us seating but we would not be able to sit together as a family. Of course we declined, what's the point if we cannot eat together as a family.  As I looked around I noticed an empty table, another table with 3 customers seated and an empty booth across from them. I know you can already see my logic, if the patrons eating at the table would be willing to relocate to the booth we would all be able to sit together.  I walked over and introduced myself, made small talk to ensure they were friendly and discovered they had just sat down and not even ordered drinks yet. I explained to them the situation and they happily agreed to sit at the booth stating they actually wanted a booth in the first place. The manger then came over to inform me I was being disrespectful and mean by asking them to move. I told her I would agree if they felt I was overstepping my boundaries and asked her to ask them how they felt. She did and they all said they were okay and preferred a booth. The manager then said she was calling and getting the on site police officer. For what? She repeats I'm being mean.  I explain I'm a solution oriented person and see an easy way to meet both parties needs. She then states she doesn't have enough servers to serve us. I now have more questions. If we did separate our party and 4 of us sat a booth and 2 of us at the table are we still not utilizing the same group of servers? She's stumped now and promptly leaves to get the police officer. People these are the situations that law enforcement should not be dealing with. the request, idea and coordination is logical and reasonable.  Why escalate?"}
{"text":"alexis at the register is disgusting!!!!!! she puts her hands in her hair then touches plates , to go boxes. retrain your workers on food safety and sanitation!!!!!!  or hire people who actually care about their job!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was hopping on a pretty busy Saturday morning. Our waitress, Jasmine, was very knowledgeable and an excellent server. The GF girl got the fit breakfast with a gluten-free muffin much she enjoyed. I had the grand slam breakfast, which is free on your birthday if you provide ID."}
{"text":"Heute Morgen waren wir bei Denny's zum fr√ºhst√ºcken das war super.  Man hat zwar zu Beginn eine kurze Wartezeit, die aber gut organisiert ist, da dieses Lokal sehr gefragt ist. Alles was wir gegessen haben war sehr lecker, der Service war sehr gut und freundlich. Kann man wirklich nur empfehlen und nun gehen wir noch zum Abendessen dorthin."}
{"text":"We are in complete shock. Pedro was the best server we have had in a very long time. Our drinks never were empty, the food was fast, tasted good, and who can beat dennys prices. Very good service."}
{"text":"I've ended up here to end many a drunk nights out. The staff have always been friendly and I usually always get the same thing since I've had pretty much everything else. It's always been good here."}
{"text":"Refreshing 60's theme. Clean, good service and great food. The 2nd best Dennys in 50 miles. The best was on Main St. Mesa."}
{"text":"Service here is very slow. The design inside is nice, but typical with many booths. We ordered 2 poached eggs, toast, and 3 pancakes. It took 30 minutes to arrive. Yikes.  Our server was pleasant, in a robotic kind of way - the place was busy - but our server was slow , which was bizarre. The food was typical of Dennys which is predictably homey and comforting. They recently changed their pancake recipe and they are noticeably different - more vanilly and quite good.   Dennys is always fun for the people watching element - it can sometimes feel like Walmart has exploded into a restaurant and voila, let the people watching begin. I like Dennys - but the service here was too slow - likely because it is the only restaurant of its kind in the motel village here - not my best choice on a Saturday morning-Ill choose another location for a Dennys experience."}
{"text":"I felt the need to update my review. I have  been to this Denny's since writing the review. Things have definitely improved. The staff seem to have figured out the place, and have it running much more efficiently. Its a busy Denny's, no doubt because of the location.  When I was in recently, I built my own veggie burger and I have to say it was very good.  I chose a Cheddar Cheese bun which was delicious.  The veggie patty, although not particularly special was a good one.  The toppings I chose were fresh and tasty. The seasoned fries were VERY good,. Crispy, tasty and slightly greasy ( which made them tastier I think).  Our server was friendly and efficient. I like that at this Denny's they have no problem with special orders, largely due to the fact that you can create a multitude of breakfasts from the a la carte menu.  Only downside to this visit. They had 2 women wandering around the restaurant selling coupon books that benefited breast cancer. The coupon books were for Denny's, so I see the tie in, but I don't think that diners should be solicited at the table while eating.  Other than that, though Dennys is a pretty straightforward, what you see is what you get kind of place.  Reasonably priced,  and predictable."}
{"text":"Poor service and was not impressed by the food. Wait staff didn't seem interested when taking our order. I had breakfast, the eggs were burnt and rubbery and the pancakes has sat under the warmer too long and did not taste fresh. Definitely won't be back here"}
{"text":"I'm on a 4 star role!   This place is open 24 hours...hello new after bar downtown eatery.   I stumbled across this place last week. The last time I was in a Dennys was in the US...that was years ago.   I stopped off for a light snacks...and ended up having a burger which I have to say was damn good.   The chocolate shake is epic and is a meal in itself.  Peanut butter cup pancakes...what the wha?!! They looked amazing but alas I could not...which will mean I have to return!   Service was fine but it was fairly quiet.   Prices are reasonable.   The diner was on the chilly side bit very clean."}
{"text":"We love this location. The service is always fast and friendly not matter how packed they are. Which is nice with a toddler. And the prices are just right."}
{"text":"Our family has \"rediscovered\" Denny's and now patronize them everywhere we go. This location is no exception. Their quality of meats, hand pressed burgers, and friendly staff make it a joy to eat at this age-old establishment. Our server, Krystal, was extremely professional, kind, and helpful. She even noticed we were drinking a lot of our pop so she brought us over a carafe in case we ran low and she wasn't close by.  She seemed to like the food herself and when we ordered she told us honestly, we made great choices!  It is nice to go to a restaurant as old as Denny's and find the food and staff get better with age. Thank you Denny's!"}
{"text":"Sat and waited for 20min and nobody even bothered to greet or even acknowledged us! One waitress visit the tables on both side of us multiple times and still continued to ignore us. Once I was finally fed up and decided to leave I asked for a manager and they told me to come back in an hour if I needed to complain!!! If I could give this place no stars I would! NEVER GOING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Denny's for 3 Year's, this is the only Denny's I go to. Always had a good experience with the food & service."}
{"text":"The food was good & service was ok. There wasn't anything specific that happened that would make me knock off a star, so that's why they get 5 stars. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8.  The hostess seemed nervous about finding a table for us and that process was a bit slow.  We were not told that kids eat free on Tuesday nights and that would have changed our order from the beginning.  Grilled cheese and french fries were good."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's not located in the best part of town but don't let that stop you from visiting. The service from everyone we encountered was superb! The manager accidentally put in a wrong item on our order and immediately came over to apologize and quickly fixed the check for us.  The food was on point, too! I personally love diner food and they did not disappoint! I will definitely come back while in town!"}
{"text":"Dear jeezus. Don't eat here. It's so bad. The food is subpar... always. They never have more than one server working and it takes forever. Just go somewhere else. There's an IHOP up the street, at least there you won't get ill"}
{"text":"Went for a Grand Slam and Sean took my order but misunderstood & ordered a slam without pancakes (the whole reason I went there) so no biggie I ordered 2 short stacks & when I get back to my room I have 4 big fluffy cakes AND NO SYRUP!!!  Whaaa whaaa whaaaaaa!!  1 mistake ok but sending me off without syrup for my cakes after getting my original order wrong is unacceptable."}
{"text":"We went for a late supper and were pleasantly surprised by our experience. The waiter named Joe and the manager named Kim had great attitudes and were very very friendly. They provided excellent service and had great conversation. The food quality was great and very tasty as well. With so many 24-hour dining choices in this city. We highly recommend this Denny's location on Eastern and Serene especially when Joe and Kim are working."}
{"text":"Once went there with another adult and 7 kids. The nice hostess elderly lady extended \"kids eat free\" night to all of them... Not just the normal 2 per adult. Very nice and fast service!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this Denny's in a long time but the last couple of times I've been here the services has been great! So today when we came back I made sure I requested the same server, Daniel. He's great, energetic, and makes sure our food is perfect. I seen him interact with other tables and everyone seems very pleased. Makes up for the long wait."}
{"text":"Well this is Denny's so this location is your typical Denny's chain restaurant. It's been recently remodeled (you can still smell the fresh paint) but is severely understaffed. The wait to be checked in was long (I actually went around the cashier and wrote my name in) and the wait to sit was also long, but not due to a lack of space but to a lack of host. There was no one to greet customers, the manager tried but he was also busting tables. Over all it wasn't awful but defiantly more painful than necessary."}
{"text":"Stuff had great attitude and was really helpful. Food came out hot and on time. Dinner was in good clean conditions."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Comparable to other Denny's locations, although their hot cocoa could have been better.  Kids eat free here on certain days and w/ other stipulations, so definitely inquire about this!  Love Denny's in general because they always have new foods to try and occasional deals, e.g. $2, $4, $6 foods.  The best part was the service. They didn't make us wait and were super attentive. A+ for that. Would go back here for sure."}
{"text":"I liked the fast service and the waitress was nice ...it was kind of packed but they worked fast and effective."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and got a free meal. The portions are big. Service was good and friendly. It can be pricey depending on what you get. I like the fact that it's 24 hours. I would go back."}
{"text":"Staff was courteous and friendly. Restaurant was clean.  Nice spot for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Yes, it's now closed.  But it's not forgotten, and will reopen eventually when I get my way.  I have been eating at this Denny's since I was in college.  I still remember like it was yesterday when this beautiful blonde with green eyes would stop by for a quick bite with her friends.  I was just getting out of work, and would come here to write short stories, poetry, and admire this beautiful lady. I would wait to get a glimpse of her, with her friends. Often, a smile and muted hello would suffice.  I eventually married her. And yet I still kept coming back - certainly not for the food, but for the memories!  It's been an amazing life and we have a wonderful family!  And yet after all this time,  love and passion for her still burns greater in me for her even after all these years.   Regardless, of what point in our marriage we were at, the feelings were always the same when I would eat here. They welled up in me so much, that it would bring inspiration even in adversity.  That beautiful young lady chose me, and I would never ever give her the opportunity to regret her choice.  Those memories and those feelings always overcame the dreadful food, the occasional horrendous service, and the frequent after hours obnoxious customers that would sit by me.  It made this place a special destination in my heart.  Although, I will say that I have met some incredible people sitting next to me, and been a part of the lives of the servers that passed through this restaurant.  It added value to those hours of pensive moments that I just wanted to be alone in my thoughts, thinking about that wonderful and beautiful lady that lay sleeping at home. Yes, she eventually turned from being the night-owl to an amazing responsible woman that went to bed earlier than me.  I didn't want to bother her, so I would come here. Both to work and to write.  For her, and about her!  Those memories will never end."}
{"text":"We came in around 2 am and were seated immediately. Rebecca was our server and she was great! Great with checking up on us, refills, and even fun to talk to! She grabbed our drinks immediately and gave us a few minutes to look at the menu.  I got the country fried steak breakfast. It comes with hash browns and eggs! The steak was a little smaller than usual but it's not that dramatic to me. My boyfriend got the salted caramel and banana cream breakfast. It's off their winter menu so it's only for a limited time! Probably some of the best pancakes we've both ever had. The shortbread pieces make it to me. It brought such a nice crunch element to it!!! It comes with eggs, hash browns, and either bacon or sausage! I regret not getting it. The portion was big and it was so delicious! I highly recommend getting it if you're going to a Denny's soon.   From what I know, every Denny's is 24 hours! Dennys has never failed to make some really good food!"}
{"text":"My friend and I come here very often for the cheap prices and decent food. I do have some complaints though. Almost every other time when we come to ANY Denny's, there's a piece of hair in the food. The people in charge need to have stricter rules on hair nets or something. It's really unpleasant to pull out a foot long string of hair tangled between lettuce. Next, the waitress we had was only managing 3 different tables on this particular day. All three had 3 people or less. She gave us a check that wasn't split (because she didn't bother to ask if we wanted it split or not) so I asked her to split it. It took about 15 minutes for her to come back and finally give us our checks, even though we had been ready to leave 10 minutes prior to her coming back. We ended up being in there longer than wanted, just because of how our waitress was acting."}
{"text":"On 06/29/18 I recently reviewed Denny's with a one star. I am please that the GM - Lisa took immediate action in resolving my complaint. Thanks to Lisa, I will be returning to Denny's at this location."}
{"text":"The experience and overall goodness is diminishing with time, the earlier friendliness and service is going downhill.  We had been regulars for over 2 years, but now we prefer the Bowness Dennys over the Crowfoot just due the staff and service even though its twice the distance"}
{"text":"These people are incompetent and nonchalant.  I was never a fan of this Denny's to begin with, but my family member wanted to come here. I knew things were going to go bad when the waitress took a wet dish tower and left the seats and table wet to the point we had to get napkins and dry it ourselves.  So we were sat down and the waitress took our orders and gave us our beverages, but then she never came back. We sat there for 30 mins and we started to noticed that the people that got there after us were getting served. When we asked the manager, \"what was going on?\",  he appeared non-chalant and stated that they only have 2 cooks. We were way too hungry to wait any further so we left and settled for McDonalds!"}
{"text":"Love Denny's, wouldn't come back to this location if it were the last Denny's standing. Two of us ordered a pick your own sampler we got chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks and one got a cheese quesadilla and the other got onion rings. The mozzarella sticks were under cooked and grainy, the onion rings were over cooked and inedible, the chicken was over done and dry, the cheese quesadilla was the only real edible thing on the sampler platter. Service was horrible had to get up and get our own condiments after asking for them several times. Save yourself a bad experience and get a burger from McDonald's."}
{"text":"Over 5 mins to get seated, 5 mins for drinks, 20 mins later, no one even took our order. Only 4 tables in the whole restaurant! We have a baby and a three year old, and they wasted all the time we would've had to have a family dinner, so we left."}
{"text":"Not a good experience today. My coffe was lukewarm and was never refilled through my visit. A party of 4 and we were not asked if wanted a refill which cleary we did , we were having a hard time washing down our food.  Very bad service and will NOT be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I ordered the biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns. .. kudos for the perfectly cooked hash browns and eggs but what really happened to the biscuits and gravy? The biscuits were warm in some areas and cold in others and the gravy had the consistency of Elmers glue. . The food gets 1 star but the waitress get 4 stars. She was very polite and attentive.  THANK YOU YVONNE D."}
{"text":"Awesome service ! Correction ordered .. Fast picks ! Good area .. Will come again was vacations.."}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars, i would. But it doesn't give me the option. We did not even get a chance to eat the food and I can already tell you the reviews for this location are correct. The place looked dirty and smelled suspicious. Customer service was horrible. They didn't take our name down when we arrived. The girl at the front seemed confused and we had to ask if she got our #correct because we kept seeing people get seated before us. When they finally were ready to seat us, one of the waiters pointed at our table in the back and did not walk us to it. Our table was still dirty and my brother had to ask for a napkin so we could clean the bench. We waited at our table for 15 minutes and noticed our waiter helping other tables and not once did he come to our table to get our drinks. We decided to go somewhere else. When we left a waiter asked \"what happened\" and my niece stated that we have waited too long and are taking our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend when I was around the area. I am very rarely in this part of town except for work. I had the chicken wings and there were so many that I had to take them home with me as leftovers. They were really good. :) Plus, great service!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a good experience at Denny's both service and food related. Anytime I've ever eaten here I've become ill and had the worst customer service of my life!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food came out nice and hot.....my server JON was hilarious and super helpful. ....thanks"}
{"text":"slow & rude. i can only put up with the service if i'm intoxicated the food does come out good, but it takes a while.  p.s. i also prefer my coffee from ihop because they have better creamer and actually have flavors"}
{"text":"We went to Denny's because we figured we'd save some money on food. We went early, which was great, because we didn't have to wait for a table. After we were seated, it literally took a half hour to get our drinks ordered. There were people seated after us, who had their meals, while we were still waiting for a drink! Food was ok, and the service was horrible. I understand Vegas is a busy place, but I think a few things need to be changed about the way the staff handles customers."}
{"text":"The host definitley doesnt want to be there.  As people are waiting to pay and we are waiting to be seated, he is busy ignoring everyone to count his money.  After waitimg long enough we left!     Could he not sometime during this time had looked up and simply said i will be with you shortly!      Nope and apparwntlu the fact that this lication has such a bad rating shows the employees dont want to be there especially the host"}
{"text":"Denny's. It seems like I always end up eating here at least once during a Vegas trip. Why? It's cheap and it's open 24 hours. I ordered the Chicken Spinach Salad (with diced bacon and bread). It was more spinach than anything else.    The reason I give the restaurant two stars in because my friend had a bad allergic reaction shortly after eating here. It may have been because they used a utensil that touched seafood when handling her food. I don't think we will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is that it never closes. I personally love the pancakes here."}
{"text":"People are nice, but service is very slow.  Ate here several times and slow most of the time.  Looks like there is no one managing on a Friday night.  10 mins to take my order 25 minutes to get food.  7 tables seated.  4 servers."}
{"text":"Food filling but too damn salty. Cook must think everyone likes salt like he does.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Waited nearly an hour for food. Customer service was horrible. The restaurant was not busy at all. Greeter would pause seating guests to finish a task. Food came out cold and could tell the plates had been sitting in the window for a while. I am very familiar with the restaurant business and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had at Denny's. I would've put 0 stars had that been an option."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to give any stars...15 minutes for a cup of coffee, while waitress flitted around...waited another 10 minutes and after 25 minutes of sitting there with the menu closed..I left. Coffee and water untouched. Waitress was too busy telling the customer in the next booth about her daughters almost wedding. Don't waste your time or money at this Denny's. Service is horrible and waitresses are the worst...food usually isn't great..but I can't speak for this visit...25 minutes and no one wanted to take my order. Ps...Kings had a great breakfast that day...service was great...only about 1.5 miles down the road."}
{"text":"Walked in and the place smells awesome!!! Very clean for some Denny's I been 2. Girl who greeted us was nice n friendly and sat is right away. Also got us good tasting water with lemon first thing! And the food was good!"}
{"text":"The water taste like it was out of my sink or some other nasty tap. Why can't they use filtered water, it is for drinking and not washing your hands ya know. It is a restaurant.... We'll I don't like soda and coffee, was afraid of the tea because they said it was made with the same water....  Some guy came and started sweeping under my feet told me that he had to get it done so he could get off work and that he was sorry. I don't understand some people, if I didn't that kinda stuff to my customers I would be trouble. Just kinda wack ya know? However the meal was good and so was the service, and she didn't charge me for the drinks knowing the water was horrible. So you get 3 stars."}
{"text":"This Denny's used to be at least 4 stars. But now it has definitely gone down hill. The service is slowwwwww and the managers never give a hoot. You would think the managers would be stepping it up and helping out their servers in order to make the customers happy but that definitely is not the case. Just tonight while my old man and I are sitting here waiting for our food..two tables are complaining to their server about the food being cold and the service being slow. Two tables were completely bring ignored because the servers were so focused on the one table complaining and making a scene. All the while the manager is just standing up front taking customers payments. Not one time did the manager go to any of the tables and try to fix the situation. He just let his staff take all of the blows. What a chicken shit manager! Nice job Ramon. Lol.... This Denny's has definitely lost our business...so hello IHOP!"}
{"text":"Went to Dennys after YEARS of refusing to go because of horrible mistakes with my food.  That said, I was finally convinced to go and took my oldest son.  The menu was impressive, and the place was cleaner than I had remembered other Dennys to be.  We placed our orders and ordered two additional meals to go for my husband and other son.  I was told they were \"out\" of the first two things that I had tried to order, so that was a downer, and the meal I did order was fantastic.  The only downer to that was that our toast was never brought out to us.  They agreed to upgrade our \"pancake puppy\" order which was to go, and give us 10 instead of 6 at no charge...all well enough.  When the waitress left with the box of pancakes to toss the four additional ones in, we paid our bill and left the tip.  She came back with a huge plastic takeout box and put it in the bag with the other meal.  We left, happily enough, but when we got home we found that the second takeout box she put in that was supposed to have contained the pancake puppies was EMPTY!  I got someone on the phone who claimed to be the manager who took my name and said we will be reimbursed the next time we eat at Dennys.  Ugh."}
{"text":"They're food is always good. The staff is fast and friendly. Even when it's busy and the restaurant is packed they go out of there way to provide you with great service."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast I had got the slam which with hash browns which was very good also had the raspberry ice tea our food was late so being that we had to wait longer for our food we didn't get charged for our drinks the restaurant is clean the bathroom on the other hand was a lil dirty"}
{"text":"Seriously? 30 min to get our food, undercooked eggs, the cook ran out of pancakes (!), and I had to stand in a long a$$ line to pay. So not worth it."}
{"text":"The service was okay and the food not so much. We get there about 3am. They do not have any pancake batter, that's fine we order two Oreo shakes also one veggie omelet and the French toast meal. When it comes out, the hash browns are not cooked, cold to the touch. The bacon was two shriveled up pieces and burnt sausage. We also got an English muffin that wasn't cooked, just warm enough like it was put in the microwave. Wish the cook was paying attention to the food not his metal music he was blasting from the kitchen."}
{"text":"The worst Denny's I've ever been to. I don't even know where to start, because most of my experience was unbelievable.  I'll start with the 15 minute wait to get seated while astonishingly bored and uncaring employees strolled back and forth. Once in a while someone would look disinterestedly at us and hold a finger up, ostensibly to say \"one more minute\", even as the bulk of the restaurant was relatively empty.  Then there is, of course, the clientele. I mean, it's the north end of the strip, so yeah... There are families with 17 kids and awkward old men with hookers. That's fine, it's Vegas, but when you're agitated as it is, this kind of stuff doesn't help.  Oh, the service. We had Mr. \"I seriously don't give a shit that you're here. What do you want to eat?\" as our waiter.  After ordering, I got up to go into the bathroom. THE BATHROOM WAS COVERED IN BLOOD.  I can't make this up, Yelp friends. The bathroom looked like a murder scene. There was blood sprayed all over the floor, the mirror, the sinks, the counter, and the paper towel dispenser. Fresh blood. After that, it may as well have been my appetite that got butchered in there.  I told the staff about the blood and the manager at least looked concerned, in the \"oh my, what else do I have to deal with tonight\" sense. They scurried off to figure out what happened.   I got my food, and it was served on a dirty plate. The final straw. This place is a fucking shithole. Go to the other Denny's, go to Walgreen's next door and buy Doritos for dinner, or even better, go to The Peppermill that's a hundred feet away, it's way, WAY better for the same price."}
{"text":"It was a convenient breakfast stop as it was just right off the freeway on the way to the airport. Surprisingly busy. But both the food and the service were just atrocious. The food tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"The only reason it's 2 stars is because the food is decent. Otherwise, totally unimpressed! It's my birthday, I'm in Vegas and the service here sucks. We're a party of 2 and I've seen literally 5 other tables be seated, be served their meals and here we sit still waiting on ours. Didn't order anything special or extraordinary. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Only one server who was obviously green and had no personality and was obviously in the weeds while hostess and managers are chatting up front. Food was mediocre. No coffee refills. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 35 minutes for a simple pancake and eggs meal. Ignored again during checkout. Go to the Dennys on Charleston. Trust me. Marvin or Sean always provide excellent fast service. I always leave with a smile on my face when I dine there. I should have trusted my gut instinct and driven the extra 10 minutes to Charleston"}
{"text":"Service was super slow, but this is based on going here at 2am to get a quick meal.  I will say this, they did a good job for my steak and eggs!"}
{"text":"SLOW! We went around 11pm our waitress was also the hostess cashier and busser ordered the grand slam which hash browns were pale at best the \"maple spiced\" bread was more like buttery sourdough toast everything was meh , pancake puppies were cute for the kids but are inedible without the syrup! Make this place your last resort the staff was nice just not enough of them to support the late night traffic."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever had anywhere in Champaign-Urbana. After waiting 45 minutes for our food( with no drink refills) we inquired what was taking so long. A server( not ours) came back and said they were just getting ready to start our ticket. There were literally 5 other tables in the entire place. This was on a Wednesday night at 7pm. We left after my husband paid for the drinks. I just wanted to scream. Awful awful awful!"}
{"text":"If I go to a Denny's in this area again, it will not be this one, because they don't screw up the food, and the service varies from marginal to completely awful. Today was awful, so I had to post this review. We ordered the veggie skillet with no eggs like we always get, and the waiter decided he wanted to clarify we wanted the \"fit fare one\" or just the veggie skillet. We asked what the difference was, and he said something about it coming with toast or a biscuit. I said we would take the fit fare one. The waiter brought us the skillet with eggs, and he tried to tell me that I didn't tell him no eggs. Then he came back with just scraping some egg off. We left. I'd sooner have a roach deliver my food than deal with that again."}
{"text":"Shannon is an amazing server. She attends to your every need. She is a great asset to the company. She provides great customer service and ensure your food is great to the end."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's experience by far. The food was good, but our service was horrible! Our waitress was in her own little world the entire time. She spilled stuff at the table, didn't know how to communicate effectively, failed to check on us, and then disappeared when it was time for us to get our check. We waited about 15 minutes to receive our bill and to-go container. Her behavior was off, can't put my finger on it. When we went to the front counter to check out, we started to talk about our visit. She bolted up to the front, grabbed our ticket and said \"I'm giving them 15% off\"... then said \"oops wrong table. But I'll give them 10% anyways because they heard me say it.\" She was speaking as if we weren't standing there listening to her. I am beyond disappointed and won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Don't ever go to this location late night.  Service is slow and takes forever to get your food which comes out cold."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Server was very nice, food was really good and came out fast. Wouldn't hesitate to go back there."}
{"text":"if you end up sleeping through most breakfast buffets, then you have no choice but to eat at denny's for some good 'ol fashioned grease! first of all, i know you get what you pay for... but come on... when i got my coffee, the cup had a fresh, bright pink lipstick mark! my bff ordered pancakes with stawberry preserve (on the side) and when the waitress served it, her thumb was half-way in the bowl of strawberries!!! she continued serving the rest of our meals, while we stared at her pink thumb!!! if we had only known... we would have settled for lunch... or even a hot dog from a street vendor. =P"}
{"text":"There is a Denny's 5 mins away from me but I choose to drive 20 mins to this location. The staff is always so friendly! The place is always spotless! And of course the food is delicious! Great service! Today we had Mary, she is a sweetheart :-)"}
{"text":"Came to this Denny's location for the first time. It was pretty item but one other customer getting ready to check out. Well my waiter was very nice and had a great smile! But, every other employee including my server would disappear to an area where I could hear them taking & laughing... Yes, I needed my servers attention 3 times! Would I come back to this location, no!"}
{"text":"Had not been to this location in yrs, It was nice. my Mom and I had great service with Crystal. Food was fresh and prompt."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but very nice, food was good. Had the grand slam, got double bacon instead of sausage. All was good except the eggs, scrambled, were a bit odd."}
{"text":"Buffets abound on the strip, but aside from those all-you-can-eat options, I found that there are not too many breakfast/brunch places to eat in the morning. For that reason, I'm giving this Denny's a higher rating than I usually would.   Not wanting to eat a ton of food before spending my afternoon poolside at the hotel (and also not wanting to spend a ton of money), I went to Denny's on the Saturday morning after a night out. So did a lot of other vacationers.  The estimated wait time was approximately 20 minutes. It felt longer.  When my group got seated, we were astounded by the size of the place. We couldn't see the wait area from where we sat - nice, so to avoid waiting stares of hungry and/or hungover tourists.  As far as the food, it was standard for a Denny's. Large portions, fair prices. Our server was friendly and explained that the kitchen was backed up, so we had to wait longer for food. We appreciated her honesty in that.  I recommend this Denny's, if you're not feeling a buffet some morning. Just be ready to wait."}
{"text":"Went here on Father's Day. We were sat at a dirty table. Someone must have seen the look on our face because they ran over with a rag and towel and proceeded to wipe the table down as we sat there. There were crumbs all over the table. They then gave us menus. As we were looking through the menus, we commented on how filthy and greasy they were. The pages were literally stuck together. My mother was with me and she opened her menu. She forced the stuck pages open and found a disgusting mess on the inside. It looked like someone had vomited on the menu and then closed it up. This place was absolutely filthy. I was so disappointed beyond words. I can't believe they would sit people at a dirty table. This is inexcusable. If they can't even clean the tables before people sit down, it makes me wonder if they're cleaning the areas where the food is prepared. I didn't feel safe eating here.  We decided to just leave and go somewhere else. My only regret is that I didn't ask to see the manager and demand to know why their restaurant was so filthy and disgusting. We were so disgusted that we stood up and left without saying a word. Completely unacceptable.  Perhaps they need new management or at least new cleaners."}
{"text":"I think some of the negative reviews here are quite petty. Try to be understanding people. This is a cafe off the strip for one, Decatur and Trop is a busy intersection. I actually went to a Denny's off Jones and Sahara...i sat while nobody even came to ask what I wanted to drink. I ended up walking out. At this location I was seated immediately. The manager was standing at the front desk with the host. He ended up bringing my food out as well. I was helped by 3 people in total. Food came out quick, was fully cooked and yummy. I was treated kindly and quickly. You have to just accept that you're going to wait at any breakfast house on a Saturday or Sunday morning...it is what it is."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner with my daughter. They were short handed. My food sat in window a while while mananger twiddled his thumbs without a concern in world. Waitress helping the new he she waitress grabbed bowls from inside after being at register and proceeded to fill bowls with soup. I ended up with food poisoning:("}
{"text":"I am only giving them a two because the provided food and I was so hungry after a night out. The service was extremely slow and my food was pretty cold as I'm sure it was under the heat lamp for at least 20 minutes. Bad service bad food I will bypass this place if I'm ever in the area"}
{"text":"The staff is real friendly but my eggs are always cold like they got made first and just left there for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Regrets.  I'm lactose intolerant and didn't have my lactaid pills, but still ordered a milkshake, because sometimes the pain and bloated feeling are worth it. This sacrifice, however, was not worth it.  The food is decently priced and the staff is friendly, but the food is very very very underwhelming. The bechamel sauce on the eggs benny had an odd consistency, the sunnyside up eggs were burned, the hashbrowns were burned, and the wheat pancakes were bland. Granted, the small bits of hashbrown that were not burned tasted great.   Anyway, while I doubt I will come back, I still think Denny's has merit, since it's a 24-hour diner. If you're craving burned hashbrown at 2am, Denny's will be there for you."}
{"text":"Don't say it! I know it's Denny's. But it's never been this bad. It's 1:30 am and 4 tables, I've been waiting for 45min for my French toast. Best part when I walked in they gave me the menu and said to grab a table. I have to be nice since I just came from church mass. Just heard the cook mess up a egg order and call her self stupid. My dad says they should close early since they can't handle 4 tables, total of 8 people... funny! Good news our waitress went back to make our food. My French toast was ok and the staff was friendly, can't ask for much more. Merry Christmas Denny's thanks for opening 24hrs!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the moons over my hammy but this location is horrible. The quality is so poor and the management (manager) thats backs it up is even worse. If something on my sandwich is rotten or moldy it should not be overlooked, she did not apologize or even acknowledge this situation she put it off too someone else. Her lack of care was appalling. Truly bummed, and I wish I could say this was my first incident at this location but it wasn't. Absolutely thumbs down and if I have any advice drive to the Denny's on the other side of town over this one."}
{"text":"After we got seated. We waited too long to get service, turned out 2 waitress quit on them, under staffed, many customers.   Food was edible but wasn't great. I asked for scrambled eggs came as a half ass omelet. My daughters eggs had cheese. Things weren't correct. But they took my 20% off coupon. Not planning on returning."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here yesterday morning and it was packed as usual for a Saturday. I asked to be seated at  counter since there was open seating. The young Mexican chick behind the counter did not acknowledge us. I had to ask if she could wipe the counter down. She stood around talking to the other Mexican customers. It took for another waitress to walk up and assist us, but not before her asking the young girl did she take care of us. Our waitress was nice she only got lost for a little while when we told her we needed a few minutes to look over the menu. The food was great as it always is, but she forgot my syrup when she brought out my pancakes and that only took her a few minutes to bring back as well. Once we were done and went to pay the manager was in a full conversation with another customer and once he finished he hello took the receipt and payment, but never once asked how was everything!!! Bad customer service goes a long way and I have no patience to eat at an establishment that makes me fill like I'm not wanted or where the workers don't want to work... While I don't know if the young girl only likes dealing with her own I find it funny that while she not only shaded my mom & I by not acknowledging us those same Mexicans she was so much attentive to for all that attention she only got a .75 cent tip lol!!!"}
{"text":"I like this location because the service was great!! A gentleman named Rodolfo served my 2 friends and I. He was great with customer service and very attentive. It was my friends birthday she was a little tipsy but he still treated us excellent!! Thank you Rodolfo for giving the best service I ever had at a Denny's!!"}
{"text":"Reviewer # 138  This location is at the end of the Strip near Stratosphere between a Walgreens and a 7-11.  The food was good and so was the service. It's average food at cheap prices. My only big complaint was unwashed silverware in my napkin... seriously. It was very disgusting. It wasn't like dried on crusty food, it was honestly dirty silverware. I was the only one. It could have been the people that sat there before me playing a prank, quite honestly.   I got an omelet and it was very good. I asked for extra salsa and wasn't charged for it (score).  My other dining companions got items of the $2, $4, $6, $8 menu (it's a pretty good menu) such as a cheese quesadilla for $2 and AYCE pancakes for $4.   Everyone was please with their meal. Again nothing mind blowing, but average with good friendly service. Also, since it's Vegas, and hot, they sell Dasani bottles of water for $1 to take with you on your trek. I thought that was pretty cool.    And no, there is not any slot machines in here :)"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Denny's and this has the layout of your typical Denny's chain diner so there is only the service and food that differentiates it from the others. The waitress was wonderful and took excellent care of us. This was during the crazy EDC weekend and we came in around 2 am looking for food. I can't remember her name, but she had a flower in her hair and welcoming smile. The mozzarella sticks were not greasy and I was introduced to dipping them in Ranch Dressing (ummmm hello!) DELICIOUS! Everything else was very good for a late night meal. The place is clean and the hot tea was consistently replenished, which was greatly appreciated :)  If we go to EDC next year, we'll definitely stop by again during her shift, cause the staff after her were VERY forgetful and didn't seem to care. No Bueno."}
{"text":"We go to this Denny's all the time. It's never too busy at dinner time and what ever server is there will always be nice no matter what. The one that was there today made extra sure that we were happy with our experience. I've had servers in the past that you could tell they were swamp but they still went that extra mile to pick the place up. If you have a choice between which Denny's to go to in your area, pick this one :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Denny spot in all of vegas. Way better deal then eating at the hotel cafes. My kids love the kids menu. Choco chip pancakes and banana French toast. Country fried steak and all American breakfast for the adults. Less then $40 total. Can't beat that. I only wish the servers and hostess were more friendly. But it's Vegas"}
{"text":"Had the blueberry pancake breakfast today! Pancakes were very fluffy, not too sweet, very satisfying! Came with eggs, bacon/sausage, and hast browns. Delicious and filling meal!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas last week attending a conference and came here twice during the week. I like my eggs 'over medium', this is different than 'over easy'. The first day they were still moving. The second day they were over well. There is no in between here."}
{"text":"The food was good. We ordered a appetizer and it did come out first, thats always important!  My issue was the horrible server we had. A young girl, like 20, maybe younger fresh out of high school. She dropped off the drinks and turned around, we said we were ready to order and I could see her rolling her eyes then trying to smile. She was not a very good ordered taker, made us repeat our orders as if she wasn't listening. Had a look on her face like she didn't want to be there or help us. She did get us refills without us asking and we thought maybe she was getting better! Nope. She asked if we wanted boxes. I sad yes. She brought one only for me not my friend? Then she asked for one and I asked for a second box ( they are so small now) and waited and waited, then we just gave up and stuffed everything into the one I had."}
{"text":"Last time in Vegas two yrs they were starting to built this new big Dennys. Don't know why you bother if you don't have enough staff on. Walked in on a Tuesday night around five. Place was dead , we were shocked they said ten minute wait. We are like why ? We only have two servers on. So we tell him we want a booth when we are seated. Another couple comes in and is waiting with us. Hostess goes to seat us both . Puts us at a table. We don't have any. As we are looking at many booths. Here is the best sits the other couple at a booth. That's when we got up and walked out. Turned out best thing. Had great meal at outback few doors up. The morning before we had breakfast here. Husbands coffee was filled with coffee grinds. Told waitress brought him another cup filled with coffee grinds."}
{"text":"From 6/13/15 My rule is \"Never go to Denny's sober,\" luckily I was tipsy enough to handle the greasy food at this restaurant. This Denny's is actually nice looking, cleaner, and fancier than any of the others I've been in, which might be on account of it being on Fremont Street.   Apparently, you can order booze here, which you cannot do in a NY Denny's. Due to the fact of me trying to sober up I decided against the Tequila and ordered the Nachos. They tasted like Denny's Nachos with the exception of the avocado on top.    Our server was fast and friendly, no complaints there. I'm sure I will wander in here again at some point from a night of drinking on Fremont."}
{"text":"7/2/16 Came here to Denny's for food during the boyfriend's lunch break. This Denny's is in the Walmart plaza and had your typical setting and food quality as the other locations."}
{"text":"this location reminds me of dave chapelle's pop copy skit. the graveyard staff has literally no f*cks to give. especially the elderly server \"Jeff.\" the man practically rolls his eyes at you for pretty much any request you have, then takes an ungodly amount of time to fulfill said request. nevermind the restaurant is empty. a miserable bunch.  the food was hard, rubbery, luke warm. almost worth walking out on. maybe things are better in the day, but dennys is usually a last resort late night sit down, so i'll never know."}
{"text":"Service at this Denny's was dismal. After waiting for 45 mins for breakfast at 10am, the manager didn't even apologize for the food coming late.  Food was mediocre.  Location was pretty sketchy.  Only go to this location if your desperate."}
{"text":"Me and my son, who is four years old, were craving breakfast for dinner so we stopped at Denny's after playing at the park. Food was great, service was great, only complaint is I chipped my tooth on the fork! I guess I should slow down when I eat  so that's my own fault!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Greetings at the door was awesome after that it was not anything we will be returning to. What a shame."}
{"text":"The food was like eating a salt lick, and our server had greasy hair and unbelievable body odor."}
{"text":"Crazy service! Felt like short of workers . Was waiting in line for breakfast.... 15 mins: hostess busy w orders to go AND cash out people AND seat people ..... Really? Lines to pay & to seat ! Then people ahead on me on line are to be seated!!!!! Helllloooooo! When I asked about that, oh yeah, they took me to seat ..... AND there are about 7 boots available !!!! Are you kidding ??????? Last time here! Waiting still for fooood.... Wondering for how long ....... Still waiting ....."}
{"text":"Updating my review! New management , super fast sitting, ordering, cooking! Very impressed now..... Three days back to back for breakfast here! Yummy steak & eggs! Dexters breakfast LOL"}
{"text":"Had a server who name I believe was Deborah, friendly and quick service. Small problem. I ordered a ham and cheese omelette with whole wheat toast and a side of fries. My wife had the lumber jack slam also with a side of fries. I requested a side of buffalo sauce for my fries, not really a big deal I just wanted a lil spice. She looked a me like I grew a third eye and was speaking in Greek. So I clarified, and asked for a side of wing sauce. Again, a blank and distant stare was her response. So I again clarified, can I get some hot sauce please, like you serve the the chicken wings. Finally she nodded and said yes sauce, then hurried away to grab the rest of my order. When she brought my fries she also brought me two cups of salsa...at no point did I ask for salsa. I was very irritated at this point because when I clarified yet again she handed the bottle cholula sauce that I was well aware existed and did not because it is bland and isn't what I asked for. Next she broughht me Tabasco which is hot but has no flavor and is again not what asked for. I gave up at that point as you may imagi e and just used ketchup.  Halfway through our meal my wife discovered full strands of hair in her pancakes. Now having list her appetite we get up to pay and leave. That's when another server walks by with a plate of wings slathered in wing sauce with an additional side of sauce next to it. So clearly you had what I was asking for didn't hire someone that be attentive to their guest and serve them what they requested. That's how you get $0 on the tip line. because up until I saw those wings covered in the sauce I requested,  I was still going to tip. Very disappointed because that is second time this has happened to me at this particular Dennys."}
{"text":"Why do I keep coming back here? Could it be because it's conveniently located within the central hub of McLoed Trail? Could it be because its close to where our local pubs are? No, the way I feel when I visit this place must be similar to how people always go back with their bitter ex girlfriends/boyfriends and then leave them after an argument over minor matters, and come back with them because natural selection has pre-ordained them as unfortunate compatible mates for life:  *throws aside raw/cold hasbrown, salmonella chicken burger, watery nachos, rubbery eggs and leather pancakes*  \"I'm done...I'm done with this drama!! I'm never going back to you Dennys!\"  One month later...  \"Guy's lets just go for Dennys for a sober up meal!\"  \"Ange! You're a glutton for punishment!\"  *weeping* \"I just love her so much man...I just love her soooo much\"  END SCENE"}
{"text":"hungover from the night before... went in... I dont expect much from any denny's but damn this is worse than any of the ones I've been to.... my orange juice was hella watered down and the staff was annoying as f**k. yall suck."}
{"text":"So came here for breakfast. Was seated fast. Problem was they didn't sit my family Together separated us in to two tables. Plus my sister is in a wheel chair and told us we couldn't sit her in a certain way. But they wouldn't let our family sit next to each other. There was a table in clear view of us that seated 6 but they didn't sit us there. Coffee was warm not hot, no sugar, place was a mess, staff didn't attend to our needs. Had to ask for utensils twice. We weren't even finished with our meal when we got the check. On top of that they seperated our family check for 2 different tables.  My sister will be filing a complaint with ADA she wasn't happy either and felt very disrespected that she was in a wheel chair and couldn't be seated."}
{"text":"Yummy! Best brunch ever! I usually get the French Toast Slugger! I don't eat bacon or sausage and I'm able to get extra hash browns! Very lovely location! Mary was awesome! Definitely a great Denny's to stop before heading up North!   Great food. Great service. Great price."}
{"text":"Horrible tasting food. No flavor. Coffee tastes old and has a wierd flavor to it. We asked for a fresh brew and it tasted the same. Server messed up orders and one of the other server spilled some hot coffee on my 10 yr old.    Will never be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Worst service I've got at a resto in awhile.. Super slow service, lazy workers, etc. I was overcharged for my drinks and I never was offered a refill or asked how everything was. I would understand slow service if it was busy, but it wasn't. There was only one other table of two. DONT RECOMMEND. WOULD NOT GO BACK HERE."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when we came here on Saturday morning with my daughter for breakfast.  She loves pancakes, but at 15 months, doesn't finish a full meal, so I end up eating whatever she doesn't.  She loves pancakes and I was excited to try the new fluffier buttermilk pancakes, and I can say that they totally exceeded expectations.  You know when you are watching a commercial and think that the food looks amazing and then you go to the restaurant and are so mad that the advertising tricked you?  These pancakes are just like the commercial - fluffy, vanilla-y and really just about perfect.   We also had an omelet which was good and the grand slam which was about as expected.  But if you are in the mood for pancakes, I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"The food selections for breakfast are not as great as I would hope for Denny's.  The service seemed quite slow as well.  The food was good for what I got though."}
{"text":"The front the the restaurant is mass chaos on the weekend.   You have customer who want to get a table and other customers who are trying to pay and go home. The wait to just get you name on the wait list is too long.  The servers are friendly but the over all flow of the restaurant needs help."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is very good! It was my first time to eat Denny's , definitely not regret,very delicious ~the waitress the only waitress did great job! Had too much food didn't even have enough space for my drink,lol"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the service here. Fast and friendly staff. Couldn't make up my mind,  so we started with a half order of their Nachos. They were really good! I loved the seasoned nacho meat on them. At last, my Bacon Slamburger arrived. It was comprised of a crispy hash brown, an egg cooked to order (I got mine over-easy), and two bacon strips on top a hand-pressed beef patty covered with Pepper Jack queso. All within a really soft and light bun. I would definitely come back here when I am in the area. I've heard good reviews about their chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"I had Laurie ... New server since I was here last!! She was so sweet and attentive... I swear if I wasn't cutting out sugar in my diet I would of eaten everything based on her enthusiasm!! It's obvious things are changed for the positive here!!"}
{"text":"I came here on Christmas night, hoping for a little appetizer to finish off the holiday right. You can't go wrong with a little sampler. Anyways, I walk in and was seated immediately. The table I was seated at had no utensils at the table. The person who took the drinks, took around 15 minutes to even get to the table. I ordered a coffee and it had to be the oldest coffee I have ever tasted so I kindly substituted it for a mere glass of coke. Like I said, I only ordered a sampler(as a half) which is mozzerella sticks, onion rings and chicken strips. Once I got my food, the mozzerella sticks were way overcooked, the onion rings were decent but the chicken strips were under cooked. Like, I'm talking still frozen in the middle. I was highly disgusted and paid the tab and left. I wouldn't recommend this particular Denny's."}
{"text":"After 10 PM they stop serving mashed potatoes. Service is usually slow. The cooks don't really know how to cook properly. Not impressed at all. If you want a sit down late night, go to Arizona Charlie's."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been to Denys and I was happy with the fast greeting  at the door and with a smile! We were seat right away and brought drinks within minutes. We all ordered burgers and they were giant! The tomatoes and lettuce was fresh the fries were delicious and the shakes were perfect! great service, great food and great prices! As we left we were kindly acknowledged and thanked for coming in! I can see why Dennys has been in business so long! The location here is clean and updated, the booths comfortable, a nice sit up bar location too facing the kitchen. If you are just looking for quick and good food try this Denny's! You shouldn't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This Denny's came clutch for my friend and I after walking almost 2 miles after the life is beautiful music festival. We asked the host if we could maybe charge our phones so we could get into contact with the rest of our group, she was reluctant to do so until she asked her manager. A few minutes later she came to our table to tell us the manager refused to help us out with our phones-all we needed was 5 minutes of electricity time and we would have been satisfied... It was 2:30 am we just wanted to call for a ride! Otherwise the food was what we expected for a chain restaurant. Just wish management was more considerate!"}
{"text":"Terrible service since the franchise was sold. New servers all the time. Not trained well."}
{"text":"Bad services. Food was cold and not cooked correctly. Waiter wasn't sure if right drink so asked us to try to see if it was correct. Also had to wait over 15 min for drink refills. Was around 1 am not crowded. Won't go back to location for sure."}
{"text":"Passable but greasy - the food on my plate looked as sad as some of the people in poorly-made Disney costumes on the strip. Long line up, slow service, and poor table staff. Our waiter was friendly, but inattentive (probably under-staffed given the absurd line). Considering this was a Thursday, I can't imagine it's even reasonably good on a weekend.   Sadly, if you're after a sit-down, non-buffet breakfast after 11, this is really your only choice nearby."}
{"text":"I just would like to say the service sucks!!! They dropped off the food that I could tell was just sitting under the warmer and never came back to see if I needed anything else. The water glass had lipstick  from its previous user The manager didn't even ask how my meal was . When I told him the service was awful, He said that's good. I told him I would have to write a bad review. And they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"Best Denny's experience ever!!  Aside from the tasty food, we knew Lady Luck was on our side when we had the extraordinary please of having Vesaun as our server. Such a fabulous dining experience due to her beautiful attitude and personality. I can't believe I'm writing a post like this for a Denny's (and I almost never write reviews) but she inspired me to share such a lovely and fun experience.   Hey Denny's manager...promote her, have her train all the other servers to perform at this level of customer service, and count your blessings that she's the face of Denny's to the customer!"}
{"text":"dennys at 1826 Las the Blvd. S had good food and the waiter and waitresses take excellent care of their customers 100 percent/Bodacious"}
{"text":"First I got there at 8:10 and put an order in to go right away. With nobody in the restaurant and 45 min and cold food later I finally left...never going back"}
{"text":"So it's been a while since I had been to a Denny's and starving late one night the we decided to stop in. I had a half size portion of the nacho. the chips were fresh and crispy and I must say I was presently surprised at how yummy they were. Also they have these sweet potato pecan pancakes with this cinnamon buttery sauce on them and they were really good. Its a limited time thing and I will be sad when there gone. The waitress was very friendly and on point. The only down side is the eggs and the hash. They were bland and tasted cheep. The rest was great."}
{"text":"When's the last time you took a late night Denny's trip sober? Never?! I'm not surprised. Nobody does that; nobody except this guy! Why on earth would I succumb to this? Well for starters, if you're looking for a spot to hang out in the area after 2am, this is it. Secondly, with Denny's at 2am you get both dinner AND a show! A very colourful, very very drunk show as put on by the other patrons. If you're in need of either of these 2 things, you fine. If not, you'll probably have better luck going anywhere else.   We were straight up with out server that we were here to watch the drunk people; he showed us to our booth and said \"I think you will enjoy your view from here and as you can see this booth comes equipped with a safety glass railing to keep you at a close distance while still keeping you safe. Now, if you look to your left that's the table you want to keep you eye on. Please remember to keep your hands inside the booth at all times and to not feed the animals. Leave that to us - we're trained professionals.\" He was so attentive and so funny the whole night I can honestly overlook how terrible my stomach felt the next morning for attempting to eat Denny's food without any alcohol in my system to soak it up. What was I thinking?  Also, the Mozza sticks give me an immediate nostalgia flashback to when Denny's was my high school hang out.   2-stars for food and 4-stars for semi-disgruntled yet hilarious Denny's servers. Can't wait to come back another night after several rounds of tequila and get emotional over the crane game."}
{"text":"Wow, what a bummer experience here! Sat down at the front counter and waited for a waitress. And waited, and waited, and waited............ anyways, after about 15 minutes got up and left. When I was walking out the hostess said \"was your service ok?\" Lol"}
{"text":"Best dinner ever! Absolutely love the service and the chicken salad was amazing! The wait was very short, our sever was very kind and attentive. Would recommend to go for dinner it's really really good."}
{"text":"I walked into this dennys and they told me it was closed. The 24/6 Dennys was closed. I asked for an explanation and the only answer I got was a hesitated \"Something is wrong with the kishen\" and no further explanations. Welp. Now I am enjoying all you can eat pancakes at the IHOP right next door. Thanks dennys."}
{"text":"Saturday night and the kitchen was evidently backed up, go figure. Waitress (Yvonne) didn't seem too sure when the food was coming out as the soup was mildly warm when it did. Toast came out after I finished breakfast as the staff didn't seem focused or professional. Won't go back to this Denny's as they seem like rookies."}
{"text":"If you would like dirty utensils and hair in your food this is the place to go. I also used the ladies room and one of their employees came out of the restroom stall and did not wash her hands with soap. Disgusting place!!! Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Prices are NOT over-inflated like everything else on the Strip. Good food, good prices, good service. So refreshing to find this on the Strip!   Be sure to check the value menu, which seemed to be suspiciously removed from all tables at times, but is available when asked.   Initially, it looked like a crowded waiting area, but wait times were no longer than 10 minutes.   We went back many times for breakfast and dinner during this trip. It was good quality food and helped keep costs down."}
{"text":"Horrible service. After being seated I waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged by the waitress. Not even a water was offered, however she did have the time to get coffee and water for two tables that were seated after me. When I finally was acknowledged there was a slight attitude in her tone. I'm done with this establishment."}
{"text":"It's Denny's.  Nothing overly special about this one, service depends on the way the wind blows, but we've never had anything to complain about here.  If you're in the neighbourhood, it's a reliable place to go to satisfy your classic breakfast hankerings for pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, homefries and toast.  Only complaint is that they don't have the best heating system in the world, so try to avoid getting seated near the entry doors."}
{"text":"1st day of spring brake vacation we came in to eat dinner with the family party of 10. We waited over an hour for our meal it kept coming part ar a time. Waited for condumemt sara the manager said there is only 1 server.  I was disappointed to see her not help the poor server with our table. Horrible service, it's not the servers fault it's the restaurant for not having enough servers on spring brake"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Denny's for breakfast about 3 weeks ago ..... let me say that service was terrible, we were seated and was told that someone will be over to take our order , we waited for 20 min and no one came over to check our table, here is the interesting part, it was almost empty in there, and after 25 min of waiting we left. not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food honestly is horrible! Looks nothing like the picture! The silverware was dirty and got my order wrong twice, Never coming back to this Denny's"}
{"text":"I visited this location tonight as I have many times. I love this place but tonight was in character with its Halloween decisions. My God, it was horrible! Ordered 2 bowls of soup and a chicken sausage quesadilla. Sounds simple huh? The tension in this place was so thick you could cut it with a knife. The waitresses were bumping into each other and running around like the bears in the old shooting galleries at the carnival. We finally got the cheese quesadilla that was suppose to be chicken and sausage. Sent it back and eventually got the chicken sausage one without the sausage. Another couple walked out while waiting. Oh, and then after asking, we got our soup. What a Cluster ####! Spoke with the \"acting\" manager, Anali & she explained and made everything right. She worked her tail off trying to do everything from waitress, cook, bus tables and manager. She is a one girl team. If it was not for her, we'd probably still be waiting for our food. If Denny's had two more like her, they'd be a five star business. Thanks Anali!"}
{"text":"They give the worst customer service.  me and my family went to have breakfast and no one greeted us. The host looked very mad did not smiled no hi. He acted like we were inconveniencing  him.  will never go back there. I do not recommend this place they treat you like dirt"}
{"text":"Worst place to eat the customer service is horrible as soon as you enter the workers had long faces no smile they don't say hi to you they make you feel like you are inconveniencing them  the person that takes you to the table  literally looked pissed off they do not make you feel welcome there are better places to eat with   good food and great customer service. Do not eat here they treat the customers like dirt"}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner with my sister and my husband. I had barely just walked in the door in and sat in the booth with my sister still standing and my husband in the bathroom. The waitress came over while my sister was still standing and I had literally just sat in the booth and asked what we wanted to order. My sister and I kind of started laughing and said for now just waters as we literally just walked in the door and hadn't even been seated yet. And she came back two minutes later my husband was still in the bathroom and asked if we wanted to order anything yet. Again we just said just the letters for now we're still looking it'll still be it'll be a little while she came back five minutes later and my husband had just literally sat and down and my sister and I had literally just started looking at the menu as well. We told her it'll be a while and that we needed extra time and she came back in a little less time than we had hoped for but it forced me to just make a decision. It's very difficult for me because I am gluten-free and it is difficult for my sister because she is vegan due to her chemo. I ended up ordering the bacon chicken classic without the bun and instead switched it out for the gluten-free English muffin. The GF and English muffin in itself is amazing, I was worried to try it with chicken and everything with it, but it ended up being absolutely wonderful. I was pleasantly  surprised. I would recommend this to anybody. However, I would recommend mayo on the side as I did. They usually overdo it on the mayonnaise, so I like to be in control of how much I actually put on there.  Our waitress mid meal brought us a to go bag with a bunch of leftovers in it. We all looked at each other in confusion and looked at her and chuckled a little bit when she realized oh wait this is for a different table ha ha sorry. She was very delightful and she was sweet, but she forgot a few things and tried to give us other people's food. We didn't necessarily have the best experience but we didn't have a bad one either. I have had a couple of waitresses from this location who were amazing and wondered why the heck they were working for Denny's with and they could've been working for something like Different point of view or even Houston's or something. It's just it was loud, there were kids running around the restaurant and even went behind the counter into the kitchen area where they were cooking. The waitress and stuff basically were not paying attention as were the parents not paying attention either. Someone had to basically Yellit the kids to not be behind the counter and told the parents you need to watch your kids this is not a place for them to run around it's dangerous. Duh! Honestly who lets their kids run around inside of the kitchen at a restaurant? I'm sorry I just don't understand this I saw them running around myself and was like dude what the heck! But it was not my place to say something to the parents. I'm just glad that nobody was hurt it was a little comical, more than usual, and we are had a nice evening as a family. I also got to try am I amazing dish that I created and very much enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I came here last week on my birthday for my free birthday slam. My husband and his parents joined us. We were greeted and sreated pretty quickly. It was busy, but surprisingly not so busy for it being a Sunday. Our server was Audrey. I think she had most of the tables in the restaurant because she seemed very overwhelmed and quite moody. She didn't smile once,  didn't seem very friendly, just looked like she was having a bad day and wanted everyone to know it. I had a birthday sash on and a tiara, OBVIOUSLY showing my pride for my birthday,  and she didn't wish me a happy birthday. There was another server that came by to help and apparently there was some mis-communication between them as there were some errors with our meals, mostly mine. If things weren't stressful enough for her already, my sister-in-law joined us late from work. We had to be moved to a bigger table out of Audrey's section (2 tables away). She sighed and hesitated, but agreed to move us and still serve us. I said that we could just add a chair to our booth, but she agreed that we could just move anyways. My awesome suster-in-law joined us very quickly and ordered. Her eggs were very runny and water. She had to have them redone. I enjoyed my time with my family, but the sevice could have been better and friendlier. Just my husband and I went to a different Dennys the week before for his birthday, and they were amazing. I had amazing birthday, despite the sevicr, and the food was awesome. Everyone enjoyed their orders (once theybwere corrected). Maybe Audrey just had an off day. I hoped her day got better."}

{"text":"i've not been to denny's for more than 20 years, so to find myself in this restaurant away from home was quite shocking and funny.  my coworker was craving breakfast for dinner, and since i wasn't behind the wheel nor had any energy to look for something new, i happily agreed to go along.  i honestly cannot remember what i had, except that it was from their breakfast menu.  what i do remember is my coworker's face as he first bit into the blueberry buttermilk pancake.  i've not seen him that HAPPY in 10 days we've been traveling together.  i saw a glimpse of tears welling in his eyes!  i trust that those pancakes were friggin' amazing because he wiped off the plate.   i still can't believe i went to denny's...all i can say is that what happens in canada stays in canada."}
{"text":"The Crane Game can't be beat! By that I mean that it is impossible to win... That said, they have a crane game! Denny's is awesome. :)  Awesome for the best food of your life? Not a chance. They're awesome because they provide a tonne of variety and consistently consistent meals, regardless of the sobriety level of their all-hours clientele. Need a 3am burger? This is your spot! 17 year old looking for a night time place to hang out and drink milkshakes? Also your spot. Hungover because you couldn't get here for that 3am burger? Do up some Denny's Grand Slams for breakfast, yo!  Fun games to play at Denny's:  Um, Could I Get A Booth Please? - to play this game, ask your server if they have any booths available. Extra points if they show you to your seat and then you ask \"Actually, could I get a booth?\" Why it's fun: Denny's ONLY has booths.  Just A Full Cup - when your server comes to fill your coffee, say \"oh, just a full cup please\" while waving your open hand in a signalling fashion toward your coffee cup. Hilarity ensues. Either that, or you'll be wearing your Java."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE food that is WAY overpriced. The last time we went there (which will literally be the last time) it was over $30 for breakfast that was disgusting. Save some money & support the local mom & pop places instead. You'll get more bang for your buck, I promise."}

The location is on Route 58 near the I-90 interchange. Great for traffic and passers by, but the amount of traffic can be a bit packed on a rough patch of road.   As I write this, I am one of two customers in the place."}

All the lady did was chit chat the whole time and didn't bother to serve anyone, she didn't even serve drinks or even take my order. I'm sorry but it's super unprofessional. Never in my life I've had to wait that long to be served at a dennys that had little or minimal customers..."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  We were told that we had too many people for the time we came in. They took way too long to get our drink order,  then to get out order taken. Will NOT be found back to any Dennys ever. Would only give them one star if I could."}
{"text":"I ordered banana berry pancakes for take out and they didn't even put bananas on it. I'm giving two stars instead of one because the employee gave me bananas when I saw it through the lid. But they should have gotten it the first time. Why would I order blueberry pancakes?  When I opened the package to eat 1) there was no butter 2) there was no syrup and 3) they gave me a fork and spoon but no knife. Why would I eat pancakes, eggs, sausage, or hash brown with a spoon? That's ridiculous.   I ate my dry syrup-less pancakes with my hands because I couldn't cut them. Nice, Denny's."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. Went here around 330am after Boo! 2017 on Sept 14th. Ordered a grand slam breakfast and never felt more ripped off. The texture of the bacon and sausage was disgusting. Flavor even worse, I'm sure these were old and remicrowaved since it was like soggy paper when you bit into it. My scrambled eggs were cold and the cheese on top made it look like plastic. The toast was horribly overdosed with butter. The only passable part of my meal was the hash browns. Paid around 13 dollars for this train wreck and it's so disappointing. Paid for my friend's meal and mine so we could leave asap I just didn't wanna deal with this place any longer and left. Won't be coming back as the quality of service was not up to par, just a sad excuse for service and a restaurant, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere these places just aren't what they used to be a decade ago."}
{"text":"When Jim's Open Kitchen Too is closed, you're kinda out of options in Streetsboro. Bring on Denny's. Quick, cheap, and not the best thing going on, but when you need sausage gravy, grits, eggs, bacon and toast, where else ya gonna go? The service was fine, interstate travelers well behaved, and the food was decent."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars at this particular Denny's we usually go on the late night but decided to go in the morning to try to get some breakfast. I have the Denny's perks card it's like a rewards card. We know the manager and the staff really well . When we arrived we asked to have s booth instead of a table the hostess would not let us sit on the left side of the restaurant... She claimed that area was closed . It was clean and no one was sitting in that area couldn't understand why we couldn't sit where we wanted . 1st red flag, After waiting more than 10 minutes to finally be seated . Our waitress comes over and takes our order. My boyfriend specifically asked for just a stack of pancakes with a side of cream cheese icing. I ended up getting the cinnamon pancake puppies an order of 10. When we got our waters and our food . I noticed after inspecting my pancake puppies and cutting them in half before eating them they were doughy. Not cooked all the way and my boyfriends pancakes had icing drenched all on top with tons of butter . My pancake puppies came out before his pancakes ..The cook definitely dropped the ball. Making pancakes shouldn't be rocket science . I'm now realizing if you want a good breakfast you have to do it yourself at home. We ended up telling the waitress we were leaving and that we didn't want the food . We saw her telling the shift manager why we were leaving but he didn't even try to catch us as we were going out the door. Shows that they don't care about the experience of loyal regular customers . We ended up going to Marie Callender's they had a 2 for $30 deal we were able to get two side salads two orders of fettuccine alfredo pasta with two slices of pie . The service was a 100 times better and we got more bang for our buck. Don't think we will be returning to Denny's any time soon !"}

No other explanation and also.  We received NO UTENSILS OR NAPKINS after asking our waitress for them!   We usually come here for breakfast and the service is great.  If you get a blonde Chelsea as your waitress I advise changing seats or leaving!!!! For as often as we go there I expected more."}
{"text":"First and for most I want to say thank you to Angela and Christina for such great server and hospitality! I come in on my lunch break a few times a week, I have two hours to kill. Anywhere between 1:30am - 4:00am. Christina and or Angela usually wait on me. They are so pleasant, very intentive, they both work very well together. If Christina is my server, anglea will still give her warm hellos to me and refill my coffee as needed. If Anglea is my server, Christina makes sure she visits and says  morning and as well refills my  bottomless cup with coffee. They are always happy. Never once have I seen a frown merge their faces.Thank you ladies for your great hospitality and ALWAYS making feel as if I were right at home.   There is a gentleman on here posting that was there the night I was. H H is a restaurant attacker! He attacked our sweet server verbally, rushed her. She was very busy. He made sharp rude remarks. She walked away and ignored him, but he kept continuing. A restaurant full of people, she was the only server there. He felt he deserved to be taken care of first as he is a valued vip member. She was very genuine when she explained she could not skip other guests who have been waiting for her. He immidately got upset. Threatening to get her fired. My girlfriend and I turned around to tell him to leave her alone or go! Enough was enough. He kept on his argumentive ways for 10 minutes, the endless harrassment. Until someone threaten to call the cops. He walked out but before he did he called this young lady a FAT BITCH.  I DIDNT REALIZE IGNORANT PEOPLE LIKE THIS STILL EXIST. Hateful and spiteful. I was disgusted. He ruined our dining experience. Our server apologized for his bad behavior which I felt and still feel he owes this young lady an apology. I see another post on his Yelp page from a year ago, attacking a different server, same location. If this restaurant is so HORRIBLE as you clam why still dine there? This man seeks out restaurant, even with great service he still leaves a bad review, he is not easy to please. He came in that night with a staggering attitude. Ridiculous.  No one believe this man and his slanderous lies!"}
{"text":"Went there early morning with few other families. Five minutes after being seated waitress came by and informed us that they cannot serve pancakes since the cabinet they keep pancake mix is locked by manager who is not on shift. We started looking at other options and asked her about few other items and answer was no to french toast and few other items. So it turns out 90% of things we wanted to order were locked by manager. As we decided to leave another waiter (who was saw standing outside texting) came by and told us not to go to ihop since they have long wait times. We called ihop and they did not have any wait time. At IHOP we were treated nicely and fresh pancakes, crepes, hash browns and eggs were served without much wait. I do not think I be coming back to Denny's since we had called ahead the night before informing we would be coming early morning. But instead of quality service we got \"things are locked by manager\" and do not go to IHOP as sales pitch. They need to work on customer service and be more professional. Terrible service. I did call next day to whisper complain but the manager was not interested in reaching out after bad experience. I guess they really don't care about customers. Would not be back or recommend it to anyone. Terrible service."}
{"text":"This is the biggest Denny's around, great atmosphere, and it's also very clean. The restaurant is bright, vibrant, welcoming. The wait staff is usually on top of it. Sometimes this place gets to be packed. So park in the back.  The cooks here are the best, the food is always served hot & the manager here is not afraid to come over and check on customers. Her number one priority is customer service. IF you were to come across an issue, ask for her. She'll fix it immediately. We've been costumers of hers for 3 years. She's really down to earth.  Also very understanding of people have food allergies, my girlfriend is allergic to walnuts, peanuts, corn, wheat, clams & sesame. She normally gets the Ultimate omelette with hash browns well done on both sides, no toast.  Little TIP: Fill out the survey on the bottom of your receipt online. You'll get a code, write that down for your next visit. It's usually a FREE everyday value meal, still it's worth it. I usually get the free value meal, on top of the grand slam or build your own. Best way to go."}
{"text":"This is the best Denny's I have ever been too. It is very clean and the service is excellent. The manager and waitresses are always very warm and friendly. My boyfriend and I go there just for the great service."}
{"text":"Worst. Denny's. Ever? Well, probably not ever but this one isn't great.   Second time we've been here. The first time was a mixed bag (server seemed great at first but seemed to lose steam over the course of the meal) and they were out of vanilla ice cream. Also, out of cheesecake. How are you out of vanilla ice cream???  This time, it's not looking good. Three servers, one is rolling silverware into napkins, one is wandering around a lot and seems to have no tables, and ours is seeming to man the desk and service the TWO occupied tables, one of which is us.   We had to wait a couple minutes to be seated and then we had to ask to be seated. We also had to wait about ten minutes to get our order taken. He had to come back because he forgot to ask how I wanted my eggs. Unless something drastically changes in the next few minutes (at least I HOPE it will only be minutes) I cannot see us ever coming here again.   I don't expect a lot from a Denny's but this one is way below their standard.   Two tables occupied and we're still having to wait more than a reasonable amount.   It's Scottsdale, skip this place and go somewhere better."}
{"text":"I've been sleeping on Denny's . Great dinning experience . The service and food was wonderful and the price, wow! I will be back. I hope that this is  not the flagship for the franchise ."}
{"text":"It's safe to say this place is under poor management or truly have people who could care less about customer service. First and foremost the hostess wrote down my name and my party of 4. The hostess then began seating people who came in approximately 15 minutes after me. After I approached the hostess stand. I saw where she had crossed off my name and skipped over my party of 4. She then sat us and stated that she would have a manager come to our table.  Management never showed. I once again approached the hostess and asked her if that manager was coming to my table. She walked to the kitchen as if she were going to get one. Once again one never showed. To make matters worse, we waited approximately 45 minutes for our food to come out after we ordered. Many people who were seated after us received their food before us. Pancakes and eggs, not to complicated to prepare? But this is an issue when you have a hungry 4 year old. This service and establishment is terrible. I would give them a negative star if I could. I wouldn't recommend this Denny's to a homeless man even if he had a $20 meal comp."}
{"text":"If there was zero stars that's what I would give. The service is sooooooo horrible. I will never come back here and recommend you don't either up until the manager can properly train the employees there. So unprofessional as you had cooks playing with good and relaxing by the cash register doing nothing while I waited for over 30 minutes for my food with only 3 other customers there."}
{"text":"The service is super super slow, I dont know who run the place but he/she did a terrible job managing it. Food acceptable, I like the hasbrown and the tbone steak."}
{"text":"Each time I come the food and service gets worse.  My nana ordered a club sandwich and all was on it was bacon and lettuce like seriously... the management is rude and waitress talk awful about people they are serving.  Will never have my money again."}
{"text":"The food is passable, not the best. Do not come on the weekend, it's way too busy and they cannot handle it. Service is slow and poor."}
{"text":"I had no problem at this location. Early Sunday morning before driving back to fresno. Girl gave me a big booth even though I am by myself. Guy took my order without writing it down. All came out good."}
{"text":"We were excited to hear a Denny's was moving within a mile of our home. It's very convenient when you have a case of the overnight munchies. But, to our dismay, the night staff needs a lot of work. Usually when we enter we are seated right away. We place our order. And that's when things start to go wrong. On occasions we have received wrong orders. We have ordered but don't get the entire meal at once as it does not come out all together. For example will order a breakfast and gets the pancakes 20 minutes later. We have to wait a really long time to get our check. And it's sometimes difficult to find someone to cash this out. We do not know about the day shift but for now on at night we will go to the one across town."}
{"text":"I will say one thing about this Dennys all the staff works their butts off! They are all very hard workers and even though the service may be a little slow they are working so dang hard. I've never seen so many people hustling to get the customer their food. Good job Dennys staff!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need Denny's :) hopefully you'll get served by Karen she's a treat. The food was good, your basic bacon and eggs :) yum and free cake this week for their anniversary. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"FREE Grand Slam on your birthday! My brother and sister are twins and they were hungry and that is where they wanted to go so there we went. They each had bacon, eggs, toast and hash browns so it's not a huge meal. 1 pepsi is $2.50 which to me is a lot, heck could've bought a liter for .99 but it did the job and i got out of there paying $17 including 20% tip. So they give you a free meal but they don't have a little birthday cake with candle, or any little bday ice cream and there is no singing or anything which was a bummer -- so i ordered and paid for a banana split and they don't have candles so there ya go. Thanks Denny's for at least buying their dinner xoxox"}
{"text":"What can I say, there's times when I just crave Denny's! I love that they have a free meal on my Birthday too. I ordered bacon/eggs with a side of pancakes and a cup of coffee. Ya the coffee cup was stained, I don't know what was on it -- looked like it had been ran over by a car and you know what? I just drank the coffee, which was good. Noticed that there is no silverware shining going on here as well, which to me is fine. The food was hot and good, I get my check right away and off I go -- I will be back."}
{"text":"So I haven't eaten at a Denny's since high school when it was the hang out spot back then. So why come here now? I had a really strong craving for mozzarella sticks and onion rings specifically from here. I don't know why, but don't judge.   My BF and I came here around 7 pm and it was pretty dead. We noticed that all the other patrons were senior citizens, which we didn't mind because it made for a quiet dinner. The restaurant was clean in general but had a few dirty tables that were eventually bussed. The manager on duty was the one who sat us, took our order and delivered our food. I think her name was Karen, who was very nice and friendly.   As for the food, it's Denny's. Everyone knows the Denny's menu. From breakfast to dinner to dessert, they have it all. The mozzarella sticks and onion rings were hot and fresh out of the fryer. Yummy! I also ordered breakfast which was pretty basic. My BF ordered a cheeseburger, which was surprisingly tasty for a chain restaurant. The only thing that we weren't too fond of was that our side salads were sad. The lettuce looked old and the tomato they put on my salad was questionable.   This visit fulfilled my craving, but as for dining here regularly? I doubt it."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Denny's for a long time.  But I heard they supposedly improved their buttermilk pancake recipe.  I'm a big pancake fan so I stopped by here to try them.  I got the plain buttermilk pancakes and was not impressed at all. They definitely weren't \"light and fluffy.\"  Furthermore, the service was subpar.  Soon after sitting down I realized the table had salt on it, so obviously it hadn't been wiped down.  I asked a staff member to clean it, and all she did was use a dry paper towel to wipe off the salt grains.  Also, it took awhile to get the two pancakes, even though there were only three other tables occupied.  And this was at prime time for breakfast.  Since the place was so empty when it should have been busy tells you something...too bad I didn't heed the warning."}
{"text":"Never paid attention that we had a Denny's on Tropicana and 215! it's truly by the exit of the freeway Mimi was our waitress. We went there after dropping our friend at the airport (6am) She was alone handling all the tables and she was very nice. She took our order, served us coffee and our breakfast came minutes after. She rocks! great service! I enjoyed the 60s/70s music at 6am in the morning! Made me Happy  I ordered some blue berry pancake, 2 sunny side up, 6 bacon strips, hash brown. Hubby ordered country steak style with 2 sunny side up and hash brown along with 2 toast now feel like going to bed the tummy full  it cost $30, not bad :) room is spacious, we choose a booth.

{"text":"3:00 AM last night. We were the only customers in the restaurant you'd think we would receive the best service being that we were the only people to tend to. I ordered the American Slam which includes toast I asked to substitute the regular toast for French toast. Taylor our waiter blatantly gives me a no.. I asked again you can't substitute I'll pay the difference?? Again she said no I cannot without offering an alternative offering to out on the side.. a flat out no! I ended up asking for it on the side myself. My sister proceeds to place her order.. she asked for French toast was adamant on making sure the French toast wasn't soggy and asked for it to be extra pan fried.. she brought it out and was completely soggy did not apologize did not offer to bring out another.. we didn't get any refills. Our whole experience was bad overall we wanted to end our night with a good meal. We proceeded to check out then the manager Jennifer has the nerve to stop us from walking out thinking we hadn't paid for our meals it was a group of 6 with 4 separate tickets we all paid and she embarrassed us in front of all the employees as if we hadn't paid! After the Sevice we received we should have will never go to that dennys again!"}
{"text":"10 years ago, this Denny's was my high-school hangout. Why? it's open to the late night and you don't need to buy liquor. Where are you going to go when you can't get into the bars, well... there's Denny's! The servers are polite yet feisty. The food is the same that you can expect at any Denny's. My favourite at this location is to ask for a booth. ...if you've ever been to a Denny's restaurant.. everything is  a booth. Some highschool humour that I wish to pass onto the NW Denny's young guns."}
{"text":"Well, my girlfriend and I decided to get some breakfast here, last minute.  Server was nice, but unstocked table caddy. Dirty/heavily stained coffee mugs. No coffee refills. No flavored coffee creamer. Dirty syrup container. Yuck.  Never again."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped at this location on our way further south in Illinois during a weekend roadtrip. We arrived around 5:30am and were 2 of 4 guests in the entire restaurant (not surprised for such an early morning). They must have just opened because we saw a few staff walking in after us to begin their shift.   Food:  Good and served quickly.   I ordered:  A breakfast wrap with avocado and red potatoes - yum! The potatoes were a perfect alternative to greasy hashbrowns and were well seasoned.   My friend ordered french toast that had caramel and bananas on it and it looked delicious. She said it was quite good.   The service was pretty standard but we enjoyed the old timey diner feel they were going for.   The location is good, right off the highway. When we return to this area again, we will probably stop by since it's one of the only locations open this early in the whole area.  One note about oour experience: When we arrived, the place was an icebox; it was freezing! They must have not turned on the heat when they first arrived to open the reasturant that morning. Brrr! Luckily they turned it on while we were there and it warmed up quickly."}
{"text":"This Denny's is close to my house. The food here is good and there's never a long wait when we go. I love the new $2 & up menu."}
{"text":"Honestly, when I think of Denny's, I think of a really grimy McDonald's - and before visiting this location, I hadn't been to Denny's since high school. However, I visited the other day, and was surprised at how much the menu had changed. Granted, it still looks like your typical diner, no modern upgrades here, but the food surprised me and wasn't bad at all!  We came by after craving an all-day breakfast that was still open after office hours, and we ordered a variety of items - nachos, pancakes, and varied breakfast items. Their new Sticky Bun Pancakes and Banana Berry Pancakes were way better than expected (sweet, light and fluffy) - Denny's is definitely upping their breakfast game in the pancake department. The pancakes also came with two eggs, your choice of bacon or sauces, and hash browns. Overall, not a bad deal - a very reasonable price point for what you get.  Service here was also super friendly (thanks to Charm for being such an accommodating and entertaining server!), and overall, not a bad experience. If you visit, try the Sticky Bun Pancakes (or any of their specialty pancakes) - better than expected."}
{"text":"Came in and waited for 10 minutes just to be greeted. Manager (assuming it was her since she was in blue shirt) just looked at us not a word from her. Once seated was there for another 15-20 minutes and not even acknowledged by the waitress when she walked by us 3 times.. While I was sitting there, about 4 tables walked out in less than 10 minutes, 2 tables complained about not getting any service. There was only 1 cook and the manager was just standing there not helping the servers or the cook out. Horrible Service!"}
{"text":"Servicio terrible, entramos y despues para que nos atendieran duraron mas de 15 min en decirnos q vamos a tomar, para no hacerla tan larga toda espera duro mas de una hora hasta Cuando nos trajeron la comida y frio todo. No recomiendo esta locacion."}
{"text":"The breakfast was very well done, however an area of improvement would be the speed of service. It took over 10 minutes for someone to take our initial order, the waitress, though she was pleasant, didn't come to check on us at all during our meal and was hard to locate when we needed our bill."}
{"text":"We all know the menu at Denny's so I won't elaborate but I will tell you about the quality of food as well as service. This Denny's location is very busy. They are off the I-17 freeway and Bell road. They are near a hub for  the bus station and a centralized location for airport pickup. They tend to be busy even at odd hours. The service has always been consistent. The staff is friendly and they all work very hard. The wait staff observes birthdays and kids. The food though tends to be ok. Often my food is not served warm or does not taste the best. I don't feel Denny's food is bad it is just the way they serve it up at this location. If they could step up the quality of the food then this location would do much better."}
{"text":"So I come here quite often for takeout and there will be like maybe 2 customers and yet I have to wait forever as if they just start cooking when I ask for my order. The male manager is never happy and never accommodating. But then I come today and my food is hot and ready and the lady (not sure if she is a manager) named Amanda was a sweetheart and very helpful. I hope she works more often when I visit. Thanks Amanda for turning my thoughts around about this Denny's!"}
{"text":"Let's just say, they didn't have enough staff to accommodate this busy Sunday morning. Communication is everything and no one even greeted us for drinks until about 10 mins after we were seated. When the manager finally brought our drinks the coffee was cold (literally) and the cup had a lip stain on it still. Rushed out of there as soon as possible. Staff up front was friendly though."}
{"text":"Where do you go when you just fly in to Vegas and want to enjoy some good people watching?   Why Denny's on Fremont street of course!  Slight wait to be seated.  Lots of open tables but it looked like they were spacing the seatings for the servers.  A tad slow to get the initial drink order but once they arrived, the refills kept coming."}
{"text":"Highly recommended  Skillet are to die for. Fresh and well seasoned food.  Good for a hangover meal. Price are reasonable not expensive. The 2 for 1 drinks caught my eyes and servers are very attentive and welcoming. Came on a busy Saturday morning and we was seated in 15 min."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's I've ever been to. The service sucks and they don't care about there's guests. All I wanted was eggs and toast and they couldn't even set us. It's one thing if it was busy but it was not! They just sat around talking. Don't come here"}
{"text":"Food was under cooked. Orders were not taken right. My bf ordered his eggs over hard and when he got them the whites were RAW"}
{"text":"This Denny's has the worst service! They can't get an order right. Forget ordering a salad you will never get it. We have been coming to this Denny's for a long time and it's always the same. It's pretty sad when you walk in the door and it takes them 15 minutes to even acknowledge your standing there with only 5 people in the whole place. Food is good but very poor service!"}
{"text":"After a drunk night in Vegas, people are always look for food to fill there bellys. Dennys on the strip next to Casino Royal is a fast sit down place to get that belly full. The staff was very nice, the waiter was very fast and cared about the service. We didn't get more then like 6 fries on our sandwach plate, which we told the server and she gave us a side of fries at no cost. Which I thought was great service. So, I would go back here during my late night drunkness on the Las Vegas Strip after a long night."}
{"text":"Crazy how other people don't enjoy this place, my experience today was great. Awesome food and awesome service. The remodel is looking really good! Great facelift but still the same feeling. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"Came here last week for breakfast .. food was decent and our waitress was ok although she forgot about my moms plate about 20 mins after everyone at our table got our food. The worst service was at the front desk after we finished and tried to split the bill. KAREN was helping us and seemed annoyed about splitting the bill 4 ways and didn't do that. She kept sighing and acting like she was irritated about the whole thing. She said we got charged for a frap when my mom got a simple coffee and Karen told us it doesn't matter anyways they are the same price. Which I don't believe. Karen did not make our experience good we thought she was very rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"i didnt feel welcome here. sat at the counter, and they gave me my coffee without saying anything and also, no one greets u or talks to you when you walk by. definitely did not feel wanted here whatsoever."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a few years and always have had great service great food, Edgar is a great waiter  with a welcoming smile and always has fresh coffee for us ... the whole staff is very welcoming and friendly..."}
{"text":"Perfect time with hubby, after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal, waitress was such an adorable girl. Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job! Strawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :)  Strawberry milkshake, nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering! Its always nice when u go late at night like us, it is not crowded, not noisy, nice music playing and always nice people around.  If you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever didn't even bring our drinks out or take our order with in the first 15 minutes of sitting down in the EMPTY diner ."}
{"text":"It is a Denny's. No matter where you are, service and food seems subpar. It was 5am on a Sunday morning. The place had a decent amount of late night attendees. There was ONE server, ONE cashier, and top flight security.   The little b***h at the counter had very nasty attitude because the line was long, she was slow, and had to seat people and cash them out. Apparently, the job was too difficult for her to handle. Haha!! However, no one told her to be skill-LESS...and work for minimum wage...at a restaurant...in Vegas...on a weekend...late nights/early mornings...where clubs are footsteps away!   I think my review says enough. As for the waiter with the glasses, he was super cool and helpful. He gets 5 stars for juggling so many tables."}
{"text":"Call me a food snob. As I like good quality food. The kind that not only taste good but is presentable on my plate. I like my restaurants to be clean and attentive. This could be \"5\" star down to mom and pop. This Denny's location has always taken me by surprise. I have NEVER experience bad service nor has my food NOT been up to par. Every time I have dined here my food seems to always taste even better. I can appreciate the variety Denny's has to offer for all taste buds. Along with the pricing to fit anyone budget. All this priced at a value anyone can afford.   As time goes by and innovative concepts in the restaurant industry hit foodies like me. I have to say Denny's is standing strong in one of the most competitive markets. My most recent experience was a Build your Own Grand Slam. I like having the option for less than $10.00 to pick a meal that I can build with all my favorites. You don't even have to ask to substitute here. This makes it worth going out to eat and not having to eat at home. Can't wait to dine here again."}
{"text":"At first I was very upset due to the 40 min wait after being told 10 to 15 min.  Food was ok kind of cold etc... the only thing that gave any kind of credit on my end was the waitress Anne. Man the girl was on it."}
{"text":"You snobby Vaughan ppl need to relax and realize Dennys isn't a 5 star restaurant like the Keg. This is an American Diner, understand you are eating how Americans eat, which is everything cooked in grease !!! Duhh :/  Anyways, I had a good experience here. Been here over 5 times. Everything my table ordered came out perfect. It all depends on your server for good service & if your food is taking time to come out that means it's the kitchens fault NOT THE SERVERS FAULT !! So don't yell or be pissed at them, just kindly ask to talk to the managers. I know this bc I've personally worked in this industry.   Also a worker told me this place only has 1 blender. Therefore ppl need to also be patient when the whole damn table orders different milkshake and smoothies. At least my server let my table know that our blended drinks will be at least 5-10 mins and that they have to personally make the drinks and desserts themselves along with trying to make their 3-6 tables happy & satisfied. I feel these servers pain, it looks like their always under pressure with that small kitchen their working in.   Parents with kids. I know this is a family place to eat but like seriously if you read the reviews and you know there's a chance of ur food taking long, prepare ur annoying brats for the wait. For example, use the free wifi and keep them busy on a device or bring some snacks to keep them busy. You guys put the most stress on the servers, I see it every time I eat here.   Last time I came here, this table across the room made a bigggg scene crying over their kids burger looking like it got step on bc it was on a bigger bun because they ran out of kids buns. Like get a life. I felt bad for the kids lol. So embarrassing when parents act up and turn red at a restaurant. Smh"}
{"text":"The food is good, service aa little slow. But mainly, very very cold. We had to wear our coats to eat. Very uncomfortable dinner."}
{"text":"This place hall really gone down hill since they moved access the the street. I have eaten here 3 different times once the day they moved then about a month latter and my last time for sure tonight. Every time there has been an issue. Food has come out wrong and or cold. The service is slow and and rude. Management does not care. We complained about the food and service and was \"told there doing there best and our food is the best. This is not a 5 stair restaurant it's a family restaurant. I told him about the food coming out wrong and cold he said well we remade it for you and you ate that.\" Did not say sorry or offer to make us happy. Since this was the 3rd time we had a bad experience we will not be back."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could.. I ordered a Togo order and when I went to pick it up I stood and the front desk for exactly 15 minutes before someone acknowledged the fact that I was there. TWO of the employees even walked past me standing there without saying 1 word.. and the girl waitress there even sat down a couple that came in AFTER me.. and STILL said nothing to me.. needless to say I asked for the management as soon as someone finally spoke to me.. he gave me 15% off my order which was nice but when I got home and opened my food I was in disbelief.. I ordered a club sandwich and it was on burnt toast and had the smallest amount of each item on it.. my fries tasted old and stale and my husbands burger was wrong. Doubt we'll be going back.."}
{"text":"It was absolutely dreadful.  I have not seen or read anyone else's review but from my experience, I had my first terrible time at Denny's.  Service for me was really rude and unprofessional.  A group of friends and I decided to come here during the night, and we understood that it would be a little crowded; that did not bother us one bit.   We were seated down and we asked for water, which came after asking for it twice. We were still nice about it as well.  Afterwards, we ordered and we pretty much waited the entire time. No one came to us even though we went to ask about our orders three times. It took 1 hour and 20 minutes for us to get up and leave. It was ridiculous; all the other tables got their food and some people that were served even came after us.   Anyways, my friend and I decided to come the next day, and this time, it was 65% empty, yet they made us wait. There were so many open seats, and my friend and I were waiting there for a pretty long time already. There were also two other groups of 3 to 4 people who were waiting as well.  We decided to go ask the lady on the left because she was the only one we saw during then, and we were told to stay seated in a very irritated tone. Well, we weren't helped at all so we decided to leave again.  My advice? Don't come here at all unless you want terrible service. There is actually another Denny's nearby; go to that one. It's much better."}
{"text":"I could have made a better meal at home. My friend and I went here for breakfast and our food was cold. Which you think wouldn't happen because they were busy when we came in. This is the second time I've been disappointed with this food chain. I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good diner... Quite a long cue but still managed to have a short waiting time! The staff are fab and serves fast and very friendly... Food is fairly good and good value!"}
{"text":"I have now been standing here since for over 20/25 minutes waiting for a to go order that I placed approximately 54 minutes ago. They told me 15 minutes over the phone and  I have had to hover over the front desk and ask for the manager to get my food. It does not take this long to make 2 waffles and some eggs. Unacceptable. I will not be coming here again.  Update: the manager had just offered me a free dessert ...but not the 30 minutes of my life I wasted waiting for waffles"}
{"text":"I am here right now and I am finding that this place has the most rude waitresses that you could ever imagine. First I sat for over five minutes waiting to even be acknowledged, and then when I was it was a very phony, friendly waitress. When I attempted to get some ice, I said excuse me to two different waitresses and they both totally ignored me. Not the kind of place you want to come in and be expected to be treated with some kindness unless you are a regular which I'm watching the waitresses hug obvious regulars."}
{"text":"It was the most reasonable price for breakfast around, and you know what you are getting. This is the Denny's across from the Mirage, you take an escalator up and there was a contest giving away Bloody Marys at the top :) Lots of people waiting but the line goes super fast! Alot of people fit into that Denny's so they keep them moving. We ate their twice, and would go back. Got the Fit Slam with avocado. Perfect!"}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with Denny's. I dig the whole make your own grand slam thing they have going on.  The food didn't take very long to come out so that was cool. I got stuffed for under $10 and that doesn't happen very often. The layout here is basically the same as any other Denny's. It's simple, it's easy and it's Denny's."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back to California.  Not the best Dennys experience I have had.  Our waiter was Arturo... didn't say his name, and reached over the table (and our food) during our meal to exchange the condiment rack.  Really that couldn't wait till after we were gone?!? Otherwise the food with standard, hot,  served quickly, and was very good.  I had regular coffee and the seasonal pumpkin pancake grand slam, with a lot of the whipped butter on top. That was good! Was disappointed that they don't have caramel coffee anymore.  But hope to see it again in the future. Overall it was an average Denny's  experience, and I would return when in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's ever they brought out half cooked food horrible service and to top it off manager was the one who helped us very terrible!!!! NEVER AGAIN next time I'm going to Waffle House"}
{"text":"Food = 4 Service = 2 Environment = 0  Waitress was more worried talking about drama w co workers than service. Placed a homeless man next to us. Have no problem with it or servicing the homeless but he continued to disrupt us while she was in the back. Place has really went downhill."}
{"text":"Tasha is a great hostess ! Very fast and friendly!  Very clean establishment! Tasha is Very sweet kept on coming back to help us. Tasha is the best please come and see her for great service!"}
{"text":"Walked in and smells like urine really bad. So we are going to a different Denny's"}
{"text":"Kind of a weird locations for a Denny's but it's a Denny's. It's new so it's still fairly clean. The food is on par with the other Denny's. The rude waitresses are on par with the other Denny's. There are a ton of seniors which is on par with other Denny's. The prices are on par with every other Denny's. Nothing special about this location except for it is new. Once that factor wears off, it will just be on par with every other Denny's."}
{"text":"No complaints here! I've been to a many Denny's restaurants, and this one was great! Our food was delicious and the chef was quick at cooking it! Our waitress was Melody!   Thank you guys for great service!"}
{"text":"Miss Pamela is probably the best thing to happen to this place!! Every time we've been here, we've had Miss Pamela. Consistent and makes sure that she takes care of everyone. She never rushes my 4 boys (ages 4-11), who insists on ordering for themselves!!! If you're there in the morning, request Miss Pamela!!"}
{"text":"Glad they put biscuits and gravy back on value menu, sad they added $2 to price and just added an egg... $4 for one biscuit, hashbrowns, and one egg....I think I'll start going to the place for their large biscuits...."}
{"text":"This place is slow as hell... came in to order to go.. the waitress still didn't get the order correct. All the people working nothing was correct and to have our order remade... I will never return this location again as this doesn't make any sense. I should have just went next door to Filbertos."}
{"text":"Horrible service, waited 20 minutes to get our drinks and 20 minutes to get our food. Only 2 waitres working at this place."}
{"text":"It's Denny's! friendly service, food was Meh? Nothing to write home about, my Bfast potatoes we hot and Ice cold... wanted to B**CH but just passed on eating them and left..."}
{"text":"It's Denny's? Good bfast this morning!"}
{"text":"My son and I come to this Dennys for breakfast every couple of weeks. Today the breakfast was fast and delicious. I usually get Sabrina as the waitress and she is awesome. I would ask to sit in her area!"}
{"text":"Great service, and great food. Went with the moon skillet and it was delicious!  Thanks very much to Letty (server) for her great service!"}
{"text":"First off if you look through my reviews, my ratings are based on how the food tastes relative to a particular metro area. (Not against the world, or the nation)  I rarely bring service into the equation ... its all about the food to me!  I was called in to work at 3am last week and decided to hit the 24 hours McDonalds at Power & US60. It was closed, bummer. Right next door was Denny's, I never even noticed there was one there before.   OK HUNGARY ... \"I'm going in\".  First off this is classiest looking Denny's I've ever been in. (Not that I frequent them) Extra large photos of Phoenix cira 1970's greet you as you walk in. Nice. Relaxed lighting, colors, and seating, HDTV's.   Double Nice ... as was my late night hostess.  I ordered a classic single burger, fries, and an ice water keeping with my original thought. Wow, what arrived at the table 10 minutes later was a total surprise. A large gourmet angus burger on a fantastic looking bun, all the fix-in's on the side, and perfectly cooked fry's.  With a totally surprised look on my face, the waitress asked if everything was OK?  I told her I must be dreaming because everything is too perfect. No Denny's I have ever been in looked this nice, nor serves food like this.   I decided to go along with facade ... and sure enough the taste was as good as the illusion. I woofed it all down in minutes, paid with a $10 bill, which included a $2 tip and tipped right out the door.    Only when I hopped in my \"beat up\" 2001 Diesel Beetle did I realize this might actually be real. Surely a  brand new 2014 Black Beetle would have awaited me in this dream.  Check out this Denny's for yourself ... perhaps it was ... All just  a Dream!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Denny's a few times since I live so close. Luckily, I kind of like this Denny's because I know I'll end up here again some time. It's inevitable.  I'm usually in here really really late (or early). My last visit was at 11:45 pm though.  We walked in & it looked like a disaster zone. I guess they hadn't had time to clean up after the dinner crowd or something. While we were there they vacuumed & started cleaning up.  Our server seemed really new. But I'm not rating poorly based on her service. Everyone needs to be able to learn the ropes without judgment. And just because your server is new & isn't perfect doesn't mean you tip her $2 on a ticket for 4 people. That's lousy.  Pro's: The various tv's scattered around that play music videos or sports. It's cozy here. The decor is nice. They were able to get my omelet order right. The nachos are SO good! The strawberry mango pucker or chiller was really good. Perfectly tart. YUM! The staff is usually really friendly & don't mind joking around with you.  Con's: My milkshake was more like chocolate milk. Not even close to thick really. I asked for my hash browns crispy. Didn't really come like that. They're called hash BROWNS for a reason. The side salad was huge. But it's just iceberg lettuce. Yuck. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing is way too sweet too."}
{"text":"Idk why everyone's giving this place bad views. The service is good (although there's usually only one waitress on shift) she always does a good job to trying to keep up with her customers. The breakfast here is always excellent and they have the BEST iced coffee. Also, it's always very clean-no complaints ever about the tables or the ladies room. Like I stated previously though, the service is really slow. The only thing I would want improved is the amount of waitresses. They should definitely hire more to reduce the stress load"}
{"text":"I have been here before and the wait is usually long. But ones the waitress get to you the all have a nice attitudes so it makes it worth the wait the food is pretty good and if you don't like something they are good about changing it to your liking like I said I've been here before but had never had the the to use the restroom and today was a total disappointment the restrooms are worse than the ones in a gas station they are old toilet are nasty I chose to hold it till I got home the 1 star is on the restroom situation but a 5 on the service"}
{"text":"If you are at Denny's then chances are that you already know exactly what you are getting. That's the beauty of chain restaurants. As for this particular Denny's...  The pros: It's is just on the edge of the Strip so they can afford certain luxuries, such as...  - parking lot  - empty tables at 8pm  The cons: - It's a bit more expensive then some of the others I've been too. I had the exact same dish a week before and it was $1 less, but that was in a tiny drive through town rather then the Vegas Strip. So not too surprising, but caught me off guard.  And yes, the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes just to leave. Myself and others kept piling in while those who already dined were paying before us. Customer service? Non existent. When people enter any restaurant they should be greeted and seated in a timely manner rather than have those who've already ate cut lines. My business was happily taken elsewhere. Perhaps a hostess/ host position should be posted."}
{"text":"Don't order delivery. Food was incorrect, they don't follow any specifications. Waste of money, just order somewhere else. Oh, and they don't deliver to your hotel room just the front desk.."}
{"text":"If you complain about this location you Need a Life and get off Yelp Ungrateful Idiots and who ever that guy is that work GraveYards is Just Funny with a Great personality keep up the Great Job! And Great Service and Great Improvement by the way since last time i came was terrible looking filthy but now i see Great improvement, seems your hired the right person that cares for there job!"}
{"text":"Not happy that they actually removed shrimps out of menus for T-bone steak order , and still price is same . Don't understand."}
{"text":"I usually don't do reviews for any of the restaurants, but to own a restaurant such as this and only employee 1 waitress (I have come many times and is always the same). Shame on the owners for such a poor customer service-I don't blame any of the staff. Shame on the owners!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted breakfast so Denny's came to mind since I don't ever eat here. As I walked in and told the hostess there would be two of us she stood there looking confused. She then apologized and said \"sorry trying to figure out where to put y'all the waitresses have been getting mad.\" She then asks the server if it was ok that she sat us there. How awkward and uncomfortable that was? Very! The waitress ended up being nice but still doesn't fix the unwelcoming entrance. Food was ok but kind of bland. Overall not a great experience so I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and I always have had a great experience! Wait on food is minimum and always get drinks served fast. Customer service is great."}
{"text":"Omggggggg este lugar es tan lento. Lo √∫nico bueno fue el servicio que brindo el mesero. La comida estaba muy grasosa y no te das todo que necesitas, tiene que uno estar pidiendo todo."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour before we got our food, and the restaurant was not even half full. Unfortunately, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's not the food that I have a complaint about, as that's standard for every dennys. If you like breakfast food then you will like the menu here. My complaint is that it is always SUPER busy in here and there are way too many screaming kids! The wait is outrageous and the wait bench is stationed right next to the claw machine, so as you can imagine there's plenty of irresponsible parents letting their kids run all around you to go play the rigged thing. It is not a relaxing place to eat breakfast. Next time I crave Denny's I will go to an alternate location!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and enjoyed it. Food is good, not gourmet but it's Dennys. Service is usually pretty good. It's usually decorated for the season and generally clean. It's convenient to get in and out. I would recommend this Dennys."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Denny's restaurants.... just NOT  the ones in LV (this one and the other one on north end of strip). The moment you walk in, you gotta seat yourself. Then it takes them another 20 minutes for server to bring you menus/take your orders. Then another 20 minutes for your food to arrive (the food's not really good to begin with) Not to mention the other people around you look homeless or they just lost their rent $ next door @ MGM or someones drugged outta their mind. Yes the prices are cheap and not inflated. but you could easily find something else to eat for similar prices in one of the prices."}
{"text":"I think Denny's is over priced with food that is not even good. I'll only come here for really late night because the store is not open for me to go grocery shopping."}
{"text":"I wish there were no stars.  You're better off not ordering something difficult or long to cook, and we had an awful waitresses. Food is below average. Most of the waitresses/waiters just stand around and talk, and its very slow. Our food took forever, the waitress took way to long to refill our drinks. Please seems dirty."}
{"text":"after waiting for 15 minutes we got our order taken. The toast was burt, the hash browns on all three meals were burt and never got my water refilled. they took 20 percent off our meal but that didn't help our experience. Don't expect much from any Las Vegas Denny's. They don't have to have your return business more people will just take your place."}
{"text":"The most  terrible managed Denny's in world !!!! Lots of empty tables but they refuse to seat anyone. There are more people seating in waiting area then actual sitting down at tables !!! Go to IHOP !!!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't give them a lower score so I gave them 1 star lol. I ate there 2 years ago and I got food poisoning. I should of sued them for all their grand slams. Never again I went back to a Denny's."}
{"text":"Usually I like this location but I ended up sitting there for 20 minutes with a toddler. No one even acknowledged that I had been there nor offered us a drink. I understand that they get busy but they could have at least acknowledged my presence. The only person who acknowledged us was the host and he apologized."}
{"text":"I called to place a take out order and I was hung up numerous times by Elias, I am assuming the manager. I finally got a hold to a women who just placed Elias on the phone to take my order. I was able to order. When I came to pick up my phone; there was food on the counter in back of the register. After we paid the waitress left to help out customers and the Elias began checking out other customers. We waited for about 5 min until I had to ask if that was our food on the counter.  She lied and said she was looking for it; when she wasn't looking she was helping out other customers. The didn't acknowledge they hung up on us or had us waiting for our food when it was ready. The manager or the waiter was extremely unprofessional and I would not go back to this Denny's. IHOP is down the street and I'm sure they wouldn't hang up on me."}
{"text":"If there was an option for 0 stars I would give this place that. 1 star is being generous. After coming here one pervious time before and having awful service and cold food I was hesitant to come back. The second time I came back I waited over 45 mins to get seated. Our waiter was awesome! But by the time our food came out it was cold. Not worth your money or your time. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Our server tonight was amazing very attentive and our food was brought out fast and fresh.  My husband and I both had just gotten off work and normally (no offense) we don't expect much from Denny's but tonight they were amazing.  Only bad thing was the very ignorant person a few tables down from us who kept shouting about how he was a sous chef at a restaurant in Scottsdale.. Kept exclaiming he wanted to talk to the chef after his meal., we tipped our server and the cook in the grill.. Anyone with any real restaurant experience knows the chef at Denny's follows recipes that are not his own.. So staff good work and ignore ignorant drunk people like that! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This location is OK. Some of the staff are unorganized. Our party of 2 was seated in a booth and our waitress did not even attempt to take our drink orders or even offer water. She did walk by several times and she seemed spaced out or hungover. Another waitress Elisa noticed and immediately came to us and apologized on the other waitresses behalf and took our order. She was super friendly and prompt, and when she brought the bill she even gave us a coupon for 20 percent off. No reason for her to pick up on her coworkers slack, but she did anyways. Thanks Elisa for the great service."}
{"text":"I called in my order and went to pick it up. I live a few blocks away when I got home all my food was cold, my onion rings were burnt they gave me 7. I ordered the bacon cheese tots and they gave me 6 of those which was also cold. I immediately called them back to inform the manager, but no one would answer the phone. This was on 2/3/18 at about 8PM. I was unable to go right back due to the severe weather. I continued to call with no answe. I called the next morning and spoke with the general manager Bill. The manager was rude and basically called me a liar then proceeded to tell me he'll speak to the manager who was working but she won't be back for a few days. He also told me they gave me 1 too many onion rings that it should have only been 6. I spent over $30 on my food and was very unsatisfied. This is the same Denny'sthat my son and nephew risked their life to stop the robbery in progress a few years ago. Truly unhappy with the customer service and in which my complaint was handled."}
{"text":"I love me some Denny's! This place never lets me down regardless of what time I show up. Good food and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with decent service but today was the last straw. Got there at 9;05 for breakfast and had a movie planned across the street at 10am. Me and my wife both placed our orders when we sat down. We both ordered hash browns and asked that they be cooked all the way thru and crispy.  When the food came out the hash brown were barley cooked. That is a raw potato.  Then she had pancakes also that the waitress said the cook messed up. We sent back the hash browns as they obviously could not be eaten and they came out at 9:45 with one side cooked. Felt like candid camera. Her pancakes came out at 9:50.  The waitress just apologized but didn't tale anything off the bill. Also our toast was not even warm. When we left the cashier asked how it was so I told her.  She took off $5????  Obviously poor management and customer service.  Don't apologize- fix the problem."}
{"text":"Avoid at night if you can, ordered steak and eggs. Asked for med rear and was well done. Asked for a manager and she had it remade where it was rare. The server never came back to see us after we complained, this is the worst place to eat and I'm going to talk to the GM tomorrow, avoid unless you want to waist money."}
{"text":"12/30/2017:  Very disappointing. If you're not Hispanic (and I'm not), don't expect to be served very soon. Hubby and I were seated for about 10 minutes before 2 Hispanic male customers walked in and were seated. They were promptly serviced with beverages and their orders taken quickly. Their meals were served well before ours were served, and we were there first. I could see that what they ordered was not any different from ours, since it was during breakfast hours.  Meanwhile, we were still sitting at our table without any beverages or without our order being taken. Most, if not all, of their wait staff are Hispanic and don't take me wrong -- I'm not prejudiced in the least bit. But it was so obvious that since we were not Hispanic, we were placed \"on the back burner.\" They think people don't notice, but we DO notice!"}
{"text":"Our server Ali deserves the 5 stars here. Charming and personal, her service was outstanding and she was both patient and sweet with us. If you go here, i absolutely recommend asking for her station if you can."}
{"text":"She took my order and brought me the check and that was it. She didn't give me the ranch I ordered she didn't come and see how we're doing refill my drink or anything I had to stop other people and ask for my ranch or my refills or A1. When I was placing my order I asked what was in a certain item and she said I don't know what to say very rude and disrespectful."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here, steak and eggs were excellent, service as well . Hash browns perfect . All and all, a great meal.very pleased."}
{"text":"After reading previous reviews questioned wether to eat here..am glad I wanted to make my own opinion. Were greeted as we entered, our server was very cheerful. The food was very good and received promptly."}
{"text":"It is Denny's folks....let's not get all excited LOL Newly remodeled, clean and friendly service. Food? Well, it is Denny's. They have some decent choices, but not the best food I have had. A great place for a cheap meal. Plain and simple."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for quite some time now this is the first time I have really been disappointed.   First I ordered the prime rib Philly melt. And it was not good at all cheese was melted correctly and all the meat was not in the sandwich.  So I stopped eating that and I decided to order the spaghetti and meatballs. To my dismay. The food I received was different from the description in the menu. It clearly says meaty sauce and the sauce I got was just marinara sauce. The only meat was the meatballs. Hmmm!! I will write a letter to the corporate office to have them change the description to reflect more accurately what the customers will be getting."}
{"text":"Great service, food took about 20min to arrive, it was delicious! Family ambience and great seating options. We visited this place on a Sunday afternoon and it was not as busy as I thought."}
{"text":"If yelp would let me leave 0 stars I would . Horrible experiences with this store this is 2 for 2 might as well eat McDonald's over anything here would be more appealing  . Our sever Yunior tried sending us home with less then half of what we paid for and the moment I asked for a manager after the 2 time of them screwing my order up there suddenly wasn't one"}
{"text":"Service is really, really bad. With extreme effort to what looked like a manager the rest of the crew could've done a lot better. We received our food in two rounds and when the first round was done eating the second round received their food with missing pieces of the order."}
{"text":"The waitresses here are great! The burgers and fries are very tasty! Feels just like NY diner fare! Chocolate shake is great and of course their breakfast can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Thought we would eat local because of the storm... Worst. Service. Ever. Understaffed and undertrained."}
{"text":"Yuck!  I had breakfast here with my friends since we are familiar with the Denny's brand and have eaten at Denny's locations before. The service was good and fast but the overall cleanliness of the place is what turned me off the most.  Where we sat had chewed gum attached around the booth we were sitting at. Not something I want to see or have in my view when I am eating. Also, our waitress who was nice, had open and closed sores all over her arms and even a band-aid. Please cover that up when you are serving customers their food!  The omelet I ordered was beyond mediocre. It tasted like powdered eggs that hadn't been cooked thoroughly and the cheese was slathered all over it and overpowered the dish completely. It felt like I was eating cheese with a side of egg. Not to mention it was also drenched in oil and grease. The bacon was the only thing on the plate that was delicious. But bacon is always delicious, so that doesn't count for much. The sausage was also poorly cooked and almost tasted rubbery.  I would not recommend this place to anyone in Vegas looking for a really good breakfast. Denny's is on the cheap and affordable side but this place grossed me out. I would not come back here."}
{"text":"I have been going to Denny's across the country since I was a little kid. As mentioned by another reviewer, generally if you have been to one, you have been to them all. I don't mean it as a bad thing - I like to know what I am getting especially if I am traveling and need a quick 'sure thing' dinner, especially with kids.  We were staying just down the street from this Denny's this past Friday (7/27/13). They were clearly short staffed. It was not very crowded but we had to wait a while to get seated, get our orders in, and then to get the food. It did fill up by the time we left, which I am surprised about given how the meal tasted.  The food was atrocious, I mean borderline rancid. None of us could finish our food  and several of us are the types who always clean our plates. The salad appeared to have been sitting around for days, the soup smelled rotten. The oatmeal must have been made by somebody who is not familiar with what oatmeal is, because it looked as though the person poured the dry oatmeal into a bowl, then put half of the usual amount of liquid and then served it. It looked like granola, it was so dry. When we asked about it, the server said, 'I didn't cook it.' Even the pancakes were bad, rubbery and old-tasting.  I honestly don't know how you could screw the meal up worse than it was. It was as if they took outdated food, then had somebody who didn't know how to cook make it. I ordered a wrap with avocado and I don't think there was more than one sliver of avocado, though maybe I should be grateful because it was probably old too.  Denny's should be ashamed that this franchise uses their name. We all know that Denny's isn't high cuisine but you should expect a minimum level of quality from a national chain. This place is terrible. Do not go unless you want food poisoning!"}
{"text":"Went for a late nite dinner with friends. It's Denny's. Nothing was spectacular but everything was good. Service at this particular location was great, took it from 3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"The only reason we went here was because we were staying at Tahiti Village and didn't have a car. The food was ok. The service was terrible. Our waitress went on break halfway thru our breakfast and the woman that took over never came back. After we finished eating we waited patiently for the check while she just kept walking by, ignoring us and taking care of everyone else. Finally after about 15 mins I flagged her down and asked for it. Another ten minutes later and we still didn't have it. I had to walk out so I didn't cause a scene. We spent more time waiting to pay then the entire meal took. Go down the street to RePetes. Much better food and service."}
{"text":"We had a really bad servant in this place. We ordered our stuff and they were really fast to bring it. Before we were done eating, the servant brought the check, but my brother still wanted a shake as a dessert. He told her he wanted a peanut butter and banana shake, but she brought a chocolate peanut butter one. My brother politely told her that he did not order that kind. She flipped the glass that had the shake in it in a plate and left really mad and being so rude about it. Then she came back a minute later and said that they ran out of peanut butter and banana shake, which was a lie. She was only denying to remake it. Me and my brother were shock at her attitude towards us. I got up and went to another servant and ask her for a shake, she saw me and came towards her and said ''I am not making it'', I could hear it because I was next to her. The other servant said she would make it for me. After ten minutes of wait that servant brought it to the table, but we never got a final check from our servant. We will not go back again due to the lack of kindness and respect of this servant."}
{"text":"Even though there are many places to eat breakfast here in Henderson, I like going to this one because of Ralph, one of the waiters.  He always remembers what I drink, remembers that I like ordering the Lumberjack and even what kind of toast I like! He has a quick smile for everyone and he is always so pleasant and eager to please.  I have not ever had a bad meal at Denny's, everything is always served hot and quickly.  I just had to write this today as I had breakfast here this morning and asked to be served by Ralph, who ever hired him, AWESOME JOB!!!  I constantly tell people to go to this particular Denny's and ask for Ralph.  When friends and family have eaten here and been served by Ralph, they agree with me, he is a great asset to your company, and he is a remarkable young man.  Thank you Ralph for always making my meals alittle more enjoyable just because your positive attitude is so contagious!!!  Keep smiling and doing the same great job you do everyday!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Charged 99 cents for an extra plate! (What?!)  No senior discounts unless you belong to AARP (an \"arm\" of the Democratic Party).  Not impressed...won't go back."}
{"text":"You can have cheap deals here but service can be quite slow. They have some nice value meals $2, $4, $6 that can fill you up quite nicely.  Denny's hash browns are pretty delicious. Their biscuits and gravy were decent too."}
{"text":"Very clean. Very busy which means popular place. Breakfast was very good. Waitress. Was very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"1 star only because giving it zero stars is not an option. My husband and I stopped in for a quick brunch which ended up being not so quick. Our server firstly didn't even greet us.  Asked what we wanted to drink and darted off. Brought me a Bloody Mary which was so spicy I couldn't even drink it. We waited about 45 mins to receive our food. Waitress dropped our plates off and darted off again. I had to stop her to let her know that I needed ranch for my buffalo chicken strips. She brought it and I then asked for Tabasco which she never came back with. I also let her know that my drink was extremely spicy and I'd like something else instead. She never came back with the other drink or to check on us. We had finished our food by the time she came back and remembered my drink. By this time I was irritated and just ready to leave. I asked her for the check which she brought and I was appalled to see that a gratuity was added. She then took my receipt and my card so quickly and didn't give me a chance to even look it. She also would not give me a copy of the receipt. She said I could look at her computer screen if I'd like. How is that even a thing????  I've never had a problem asking for a receipt. I had a 20% off coupon that I placed with my card which she failed to take and then came back and said it was too late and maybe I could use it next time. Seriously?! I will never go back there. To all others, STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow. The kids pizza look really bad. (See it for yourself) Waitress never came back to get refills. Manages was very nice and carried a smile all over the restaurant but that didn't make it better"}
{"text":"Server was not aware of any menu changes. They only had certains things on the menu available. Food was hot"}
{"text":"Slowest most terrible service we've received in a long time. We almost walked out. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"Today we went back to the Warm Springs location...  Service was great and the restaurant was busy.  We got a table within a few minutes wait and the waitress right away greeted us with a smile and took our drink orders.  I tried the \" build a burger \" again It was exactly how I wanted it and cooked to prefect. The others orders cane out as expected.  I would like to thank the Managers Jennifer and  Alex and Staff for getting this location into great shape.  We shall continue to return on a more often  Thanks !!"}
{"text":"Its 4 A.M. You've been out partying in Vegas all night and staring you in the face is a huge Denny's sign. You realize that it's in your best interest to go back to your hotel and pass out, but the rumbling in your stomach and your drunk friends just won't let you do that. So, you head in, sit down, and in a dizzy drunken frenzy, try to figure out what the hell you want to eat.  Maybe that happened, maybe it didn't. Let's just pretend we're in a world of pure fiction right now. We ended up getting an order of some of the crunchiest most delectable cheese sticks I have ever had. While more than half of my friends were passed out, I enjoyed every single bite of mozzarella goodness.  The great thing about this Denny's was surprisingly the waiter. She could instantly decipher our inebriated state, but didn't give us any attitude or treat us like your typical college students. Instead, she just laughed along with our stupid jokes and was very courteous and timely. This Denny's is perfect if you're hungry in the middle of the night and want to fulfill those munchies that you've been craving for all night."}
{"text":"For years Denny's has been my favorite place for breakfast, may be its their pancakes or just the easy ambiance. I am, however, increasingly disappointed in the restaurants when it comes to cleanliness. The table, the floors, the syrup bottles, almost everything seems old, greasy and icky in general. We ate at this location a crew days ago while the food was fine, the overall experience was not enjoyable. I had the steak and egg omelette and my wife had thr pancakes, everything was fine and expected for the price, nothing outstanding and nothing cheap.  These restaurants everywhere need a lift up."}
{"text":"Our experience last night, We arrived to 7:30 pm to celebrate my daughters birthday. 8:00 P.M. rolls around and still no server to take orders or bring water. Around 8:15 I flag down a server and let her know we had somewhere to be at 10:00 PM we get our finally get our orders taken.  Wait.. wait.. wait.. no food.. FINALLY after threatening to walk out at 9:00 pm. Yes, that's right an hour and a half later around 9:15 P.M. we FINALLY get our food.  The food was decent for a 24 hour diner. My issue is not with the quality of food but with the service. 2 servers for the entire restaurant??  That's too much for 2 people. Having experience in the food industry I understand being short staffed, my issue is that was made known prior to sitting down to eat, if we would of known we would of went somewhere else. Denny's if you are short staffed TELL PEOPLE BEFORE YOU SEAT THEM PLEASE!!!  Manager did comp part of the meal because of the inconvenience."}
{"text":"We went after going to Glendale Glitters and got here about 10pm.  We sat down right after walking in, they weren't too busy at that time.  We had to wait almost 10 minutes before a server came over, guess his shift was just starting because you could hear either the other server or manager telling our server to that maybe they want to clock in and start working since their shift was starting.  I got our menus, we had to wait to get silverware until after our food came because they said they didn't have any, some of our silverware was still a bit dirty.  Our server took a few minutes to bring our drinks and that was after he had to come back and ask again what one of them was.  He was slow, but nice enough.  The food was okay, it's typical Denny's food.  When we were about to leave,  I counted I believe 6 of the employees standing outside, near the front door, talking and smoking.  Even the MoD was out there with them!  Right outside the door, not even down the ramp, not the 20 feet all the signs says.  I'm pretty sure the only employee left in the building was the kid that was serving us."}
{"text":"Met the MIL here for a quick bite one evening.  Had to seat ourselves, wait a few minutes to be approached by the one server that was actually working because the other one kept having to run to the bathroom because she was that far in her pregnancy.  I had to get up to get a menu.  Cheesesteak sandwich was okay, but the fries were kinda cold. MIL got the roast dinner which has 3 huge scoops of mashed potatoes and a tiny bit of meat.  Nothing like the picture."}
{"text":"Graveyard cook was horrible. Made the worst moons over my Hammy plate I have had in my life. Eggs were over cooked and there was no ham on the sandwich. Hash browns were burnt when I asked them to be preppared crispy. The cook needs to learn how to cook on lower temmperatures. Will not go back there. Overall bad experience and it was dead in there. No reason to cook on high temps and tear down food quality."}
{"text":"Why is it restaurant policy to deep fry  home frys. It distorts the flavor of the ingredients. I asked waitress to tell cook to saut√© home frys like they are meant to be cooked. Cook told her her could not do it because they were frozen. Which makes no sense at all. This seems to be policy at all Dennys. This is a quality issue. Also there were 4 people in my party. 2 of my friend were served their meal 15 to 20 min before my other friend and I. My toast came out 10 min before meal. There were about 4 tables being served. Being busy is no excuse for poor service. I am a former cook at a very high volume Denny's and never took sub quality short cuts. I do not understand why this is being allowed. Dennys use to stand for quality at a good price"}
{"text":"Every once in a while, even the most familiar chains, will do something to impress me. That's why I'm Yelping about the Denny's near Litchfield Road and I-10. In a nutshell, it involves coffee and a ridiculous hour in the AM.  This past Veteran's Day, my girlfriend and I decided to join her father for a flag raising ceremony at dawn. You don't say no to a Marine. And, you don't say no to a Marine when he wants to grab a bite to eat on the way. Which is why we found ourselves at Denny's at 5:00 in the morning.  Denny's was an easy choice because it was convenient to where we were headed. And it's familiar enough to keep everyone in our group happy. And let's be honest. Denny's is Denny's. The classic rock bopping in the background keeps with their diner theme. Even if it was a little oppressive to those of us struggling to wake up.  Now, about that coffee... It's good. It's very good. And our waitress was very attentive and kept it topped off the whole time. If this was just about coffee, we'd be looking at five stars. The food was about what you'd expect. It's average and my scrambled eggs were a little runnier than I would like. But the pancakes made up for the other shortcomings (soggy bacon). Seriously, Denny's pancakes are better than I remember!  Despite the pre-dawn hour, we were re-acquainted with an old friend. The coffee and pancakes plus the friendly service were more than enough to make me want to drop in again... After the sun rises."}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas and I decide to eat in Denny's.  Why?  It is comfort food and we don't have Denny's around home anymore.  I had the Santa Fe Spicy Skillet for lunch and it hit the spot. I'm trying to limit the carb intake so I substituted the red potatoes for extra mushroom.  It came quickly and exactly as ordered.  Service was great and restaurant appeared to be clean.  I say \"appeared\" because I went from the door to my table and back out the door when I was done.  So at least that small of the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"They really sucks, order food 30 mins ago and still didn't get anything. They microwave food every single time. It also stinks. Place is also not clean and staff shows attitude."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes are always great here tried something new that Meatloaf dinner with mashed potatoes and corn and the mashed potatoes were great corn was good the meatloaf was good up until I got to the middle of it and it was raw and cold send it back made it again came back the waitress asked if I'd like to check it so I cut into the middle and it was raw and cold again so not just once twice just absolutely disgusted hope I don't get food poisoning from the first half that I ate"}
{"text":"Probably the only Denny's you'll find customer service like a five star restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Came in today for brunch with a few friends. I ordered a lumberjack slam. The toast was burnt and placed on the plate with the burnt side down, probably so I wouldn't notice. The second slice was hardly even toasted. I had ham on my plate that was only grilled on one side. I understand that it was busy, but it is unacceptable to try to skate by and allow the quality of food to suffer. One of my friends meals came out 10 minutes after the rest. Another's order was incorrect, and she had to wait for the right fries to come out. The 3rd friend ordered a Philly cheesesteak that was so sloppy and gross that it was inedible. I have been here a few times before and have not had issues like this. This location needs to step up its standards."}
{"text":"It took really long to get our food which consisted of buffalo chicken wraps, the grilled cheese sandwich and a biscuit with gravy. We went at 12pm on a Saturday, so it was really busy, but it took like 20 minutes to get food.   The food itself was pretty good. I enjoyed my buffalo chicken wrap until I bit into a fatty piece. They didn't give me enough ranch dressing for fries though. I also had the pancake puppies sundae which was very delicious and a bargain at $2.   Overall, Denny's has cheap food, slow service, and okay quality."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I came in for breakfast. Our server Nancy was wonderful. She was sweet, personable and overall amazing. The food was served fast and was delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The server Arianna is TERRIBLE. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome, no silverware, had 3 kids w me and had no napkins until the meal was almost over and we ate w our hands (no silverware). Rolls her eyes constantly. Come on girl! Pull it together. You are a server. The only reason you are there is to serve people and give them a pleasant dining experience. Don't argue w a mom of three toddlers that you don't have a grilled cheese on the menu and can't possibly do fries on the side of a kids meal item. That's ridiculous.  I'm rolling my eyes at your service lol just like you. Btw I usually have 100% tip day when I take my kids out bc I know you are losing out on money by having one adult. You got 3 bucks.... smile next time."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss.  Service is good sometimes and sometimes it's not.  Seems like they have a new manager now and are trying to improve things.  I will come back just because I love breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband and spent Christmas in AZ and ended up at this location for breakfast. Denny's in Ahwatukee has become our go to for our departing breakfast, but since our daughter purchased her first home in Chandler we decided to try this location; which turned out to be a bad decision and delayed us getting home to San Diego by more than an hour. Needless to say it was busy Christmas morning, but management truly mishandled our situation. We sat almost 30 minutes with no server whatsoever to inquire about coffee or any thing. After they finally arrived, they took our order and it took an hour for 2 standard skillet breakfasts, an order of pancakes and an english muffin to hit the table. None of us had ordered coffee and you would have thought that after the first 20-40 minutes the manager would have offered some for free or maybe a glass of juice. It was almost an hour before she even made a table call and at that point, was less than sympathetic and almost arrogant in her attitude. She is a truly poor representative of this location [approx 60 and white blonde hair] and the parent corporation or owners should take a hard look at an attitude adjustment. Being a business owner, I understand a bad day or a busy one, but a smile and a free cup of anything ofter allows us to recover with our patrons. Well, its been almost 2 months and we have been back to AZ and Denny's in Ahwatukee several times, and while they are not always fast, they are indeed sincere about trying to leave us with a caring impression."}
{"text":"I love going to Denny's whenever I want something inexpensive but not fast food. I normally go to this location for lunch. I've always had great service. Food is cooked just right and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes before we got our waters, 15 minutes to even take our order and right as the manager was going to come speak with us he helped another guest and I saw him walk out the front door and I didn't see him for the remainder of service. The table next to us waited 20+ minutes just for a side salad.  Service was severely slacking"}
{"text":"Horrible service waiter forgot my drink order not one but twice and forgot who's orders is which. Then no silver wear and was waiting for our order taking for about 20mins. So when it came to finally getting my drink I was annoyed and decided to go with water. I will not be eating here again slow service and it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and service l, i ordered french toast and my wife had biscuits and gravy. Everything was as we expected."}
{"text":"I tried to give denny's another chance in another part of town, but it still SUCKS. there were a minimum amount of customers and the service was still lousy. the food is so expensive for the quality or lack thereof. Denny's you will never get another dime from me no matter how hungry I am. for that 2.99 you charged for OJ, lemonade and coffee each....well that's just a big fat rip."}
{"text":"One of the most unappreciated place for a dining option is Denny's. I always feel they get the bum rap because of the way on how cheap fast comfort food was made that goes in hand with a down to earth people that is servicing you.  It seemed like it's beneath for anyone whenever this place get chosen as the dining option. We always takes it for granted because it opened 24 hours and it would always be a fall back plan in case the better restaurant down the Vegas strip was full.  This place is the good ol' reliable. A few times when we need to grab a hearty breakfast before we hit the road home, we always stopped by here instead of launching into a gorge feast at another buffet.  Goodness gracious, haven't we ate enough?  I just love the folksy charm of the place with friendly smile and the ever refillable hot coffee that is ready for you. I still can't get over the jam on the butter white toast and the hot scrambled egg with sausage. The only thing I would skip was the rubber pancakes, but people still love'em.  This place never gets the appreciation from many diners until you need them, but I just can't get over the fact we'll get the young couples who just got hitch getting the congrats from a trucker who is about to hit the long road to Utah. Or the fact that a high roller would be spending here instead of guzzing it up in his hotel room for dining in room service.  Nothing beats Denny for a hearty meal on the Vegas strip. Just make sure you come early enough because everyone in town will have the same thing in their mind.  Let's just hope they are still at the slot machine when you get here."}
{"text":"The \"NEW! Fit Fare Alaska Salmon\" is pretty damn good you can order it anytime of the day and its delicious.  On a budget?  $4.00 all you can eat pancakes or a $6.00 Classic Burger and fries.  Third shift staff is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever found @ Dennys!   They took 15 min to assign us a table (almost empty when we arrived)  Once seated it took another 25 minutes to get our order and drinks...   Then another 45 minutes to have our meals ready...  Let's do some math...  15+25+45 = 1 hour and 25 minutes to get a simple meal on an almost empty place...  Long story short... Dennys is generally slow ... well... this place redefines this concept..."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's ever!!!! We have been sitting here for over 25 minutes and to had to ask three times for someone to get us our drinks let alone out food. I wish it had he option to put zero stars!!!! Ok update because I have all this time. It's been 50 minutes and no food yet!! If I wasn't  so hungry is leave this place."}
{"text":"Taryn has to be the absolute best server in the history of servers. She always makes me feel like a best friend every time I come here to munch on some good eats. She is always so insightful on what would be best to order if you ever have questions."}
{"text":"The only reason this is a one-star review instead of zero is because the food was ok. But we waited so long we almost walked out. 3 groups of people that were sat after we did, somehow ended up being served first, which isn't a big deal but was a bit annoying. That got much more annoying after they were able to finish their meals and leave before we had even been served. After we finally got our food and drinks, we didn't see the waitress again until we had finished our meals. She said she was going to bring the check, and then 20 minutes later her co-worker finally brought it instead. Thank god we weren't on a schedule. This is the first time since before I can honestly remember that I left no tip at all... usually 10% is my minimum, even if the service sucked. Do yourself a favor and don't go to this dennys while you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good Breakfast combination.  Haven't had pancakes for a long time and was disappointed. Orange juices seems to always be fresh however, stick to basic the bacon,eggs and hash-browns, this will certainly make your day happy!"}
{"text":"Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me!!! Free breakfast hooray. Best way to start celebrating. Came here for late brunch with my bestie. It was really busy but it's located at truck stop and it's New Years. For your bday you get to build your own breakfast....2 of and four items like eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, toast and hash brown. The service was excellent. Shaela was a super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I ate there on 04/29/18 with my family. The place was filthy cups all over the bar needing to be bused. There were at least 6 tables that had dirty plates and drinks waiting to be bused for over an hour. The service was super slow and the waitress who kept calling us her sweets was terrible and never checked back on us after she took our order. Then the restroom, let me tell you there was trash everywhere. All over the floors, and counters. When my mom went to inform the staff. Including the manager they talked badly about her, after she left the restaurant, calling my mom a snob and stuck  up and laughing. I will never return and I would advise Dennys look at this store closely cause after I post this I'm reporting to the health inspector."}
{"text":"Ok so.....we sat for about 10 minutes before we were asked for our order....another 25 minutes for our food to arrive...and although the bubbly waiter (disguised as an adorable leprechaun  complete with light up shamrock necklace) ensured that he asked the cook to make my omelet WITHOUT cheese, it had cheese. Once again proving that people don't read the order..they mindlessly do their job. The cook was probably fantasizing about a life that doesn't closely resemble hell (yes, that line comes from AMERICAN BEAUTY). Ugh...now I will be farting all day from that person's stupid mistake!"}
{"text":"Horrible service the manager is literally trying to give me old food that was my old order that was a wrong online order that they messed up I've been waiting here for a hour still no food don't come here and the main manager was outside having a social life while my order was still not completed for the 3rd Time corporate needs to stop hiring unprofessional people this Denny's gives Denny's a bad name"}
{"text":"We were in the mood to have some diner food on Friday and our two year old was a little fussy from a short nap so we thought why not go casual and see how our neighborhood Denny's is.       We were kind of greeted by the manager who saw us come in and stayed seated for about 10 seconds before getting up to explain that she was tired. At about that time the female server came over and showed us to the booth and asked if we needed a high chair. I said yes please and she said \"OK wait a minute\" and left to go do something.  After a moment I realized she really wanted us to wait there for a full minute. I looked around and grabbed a highchair from the sidewall.       I ordered the cinnamon pancake breakfast and the server suggested that I get half bacon and half sausage since I wasn't sure which one to choose. My girlfriend ordered the nachos and our daughter got the dinosaur chicken nuggets. When the food came, there was one strip of thin bacon and one very small sausage link. I asked the girl why she suggested getting half and half if the serving size was only two to begin with. She had no answer at all except \"That is how it comes\". The meat was room temperature (I assume it sat around waiting because the cook forgot to drop the chicken nuggets). The pancakes were horrible. They tasted like they were made with too much egg and had a texture of an omelet more than a pancake. The nachos and nuggets came out OK.       It was time to go and the same female manager cashed us out. She informed me that the bill was 31 dollars and I said \"That doesn't sound right\". Without any inquiry she printed out an itemized check, handed it to me and aggressively said \"I don't know, you tell me\". She shifted back and forth and her body language was telling me to hurry up. That is just ridiculous. I don't know if the check was right or not. We payed the bill and got out of there. That was enough for me to know that our business is not appreciated. With all the options on Eastern, there is no need to give this Denny's another chance."}
{"text":"I have not eaten at a Denny's in ages, but our flight in was delayed so food places are slim pickings at this time of night/morning. The service was fast, but the food prep was a bit slow. i hate to see what happens when the place gets busy. Quality good, service good, friendly staff good, kitchen speed poor. overall 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good food...bad customer service. Even on a slow night, they walk around as if they don't have tables. Very inattentive & we basically only saw our server twice & waited longer for our bill. Want to kill some time? Come here if not, avoid this location."}
{"text":"Clean place. Quick service. You can see planes landing from some of the booths. Our waitress was clearly pretty busy but polite. She didn't come back to offer more coffee."}
{"text":"Went in around 12am and the place wasn't too busy as you might expect at midnight. Waited for 15-20 minutes for the food to show up and when it arrived we were missing my boyfriend's food. The server apologized explaining that the kitchen forgot the order (but I think she had forgot to ring it in and wasn't being upfront) and said \"please don't hate me\". His food came out after about 5min and the waitress did offer us a complimentary dessert but I was still disappointed with service because she was simply not very attentive. We watched her do sidework as we were waiting on her to come by to our table. Being a server myself I understand that there are circumstances that are out of your control and sometimes you can't give as good of service as you normally would  however I feel that we could have had much better experience had our server been more attentive because it simply wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"This Dennys is an ok location. Never had any serious complaints other than maybe waiting for a refill here and there. I am SO sad that they stopped offering the half portion of moons over my hammy though because I never finish it. Love the boneless buffalo wings!"}
{"text":"Officially the WORST dining experience ever. My food came out wrong twice and in addition the first order of pancakes had a piece of plastic in them. I had no modifications to my order, but it didn't even come out like the menu description.  I ordered the banana pecan wheat pancakes with egg whites and two strips of turkey bacon. This is how the menu read. I got regular scrambled eggs, a piece of sausage, regular bacon, no bananas on the pancakes and the pancakes weren't wheat. The second set of pancakes (after the set with plastic) weren't wheat which I just dealt with and she acted out out by my asking for bananas.  She was rude and condescending. She gave us our check as soon as she dropped the food off and then after the pancake fiasco we asked for a new check as she said she would take care of some things. She dropped the second check and said they took off a few dollars for the inconvenience. The second check was exactly the same as the first. When confronted about this she said there was no one there that could discount it. She lied to us. This was a horrible experience and we will absolutely not be back."}
{"text":"Food was ok for 1am but they refused to substitute any kind of vegetation sides in the place of bacon which is absurd. Any breakfast should do that. Why can I have toast with my eggs instead of bacon if I'm vegetarian?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they have such poor reviews. This place is excellent! Enjoyed fast service and great food.  My server was Nicole and she did a fantastic job with a great smile!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was not looking forward to going here, but it was Christmas day and we didn't feel like going to a casino for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised by our friendly waitress who helped me make sure my choices were vegan. Not many options but the food was fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"Came in last night to have a late/early bite after the club, my friends and I were having a great time laughing as we walked in and the hostess was so rude! She literally said \"watch your mouth, you're getting loud\" wtf! This is Vegas, not a kindergarten! We got up and left, couldn't take looking at her rude face for a minute longer! And to out defense we weren't being that loud #truestory"}
{"text":"I came with my family to eat and they treated us excellent the waitress \"Daisy\"served our every order correctly I recommend you to come to this place."}
{"text":"So much better this time :-) quick, yummy, friendly. Milk shakes are amazing, mozzarella sticks are delicious with massive stretchiness, the Italian sampler is 3 meatballs, garlic bread,and 6 mozzarella sticks. Salmon can be dry but still yummy, rice is delicious and truly wild, broccoli is yummy too. Coffee is good."}
{"text":"Great experience, yummy food. My own complaint is the lack of having peoper jack cheese. I can't stand Swiss cheese, but if there is no other way around it I'll eat it... my philly cheese steak omelet was loaded with it (can't say it wasn't cheesy) but it had so much Swiss cheese I got nauseous. The cake batter milkshake was gone in 5 mins, the chocolate milkshake wasn't chocolaty enough. But still a great time"}
{"text":"The order online service never works. I had to call the store where I was placed on hold multiple times only to have them hang up on me. Great customer service."}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is because it's close to where I live. The food is great but the service is absolutely horrible every time. It seems like the waiters just take your order and disappear until it's time to pay. Tonight I never got my refill and I never got any sugar for my coffee. I also had to get up and get my own utensils and sugar because my waiter Ian was no where in sight. In fact my waiter just disappeared to the point where I had to go and ask for my check."}
{"text":"My husband and and I went for breakfast and were greeted by a young girl that clearly hated working there. We were seated in a booth that had a sticky surface, it was gross.  Then we keep hearing F bombs from the staff in the kitchen.  If it wasn't for our great server Edgar, we would have left.  Food was mediocre at best.  We won't be back, we will go to IHOP next time.  Clean up your act Denny's on Simmons!  Terrible!"}
{"text":"I love Denny's restaurants.  Yes, you get a broad range of service and food quality by location and time of day.  This particular visit was not so great.  They weren't all that busy and seemed to have a full staff on duty, but service was painfully slow.  PAINFULLY SLOW!  I ordered two eggs, two pieces of bacon, hash browns and toast.  It was NOT two eggs, I can tell you that.  The bacon was so tiny it hardly made up one normal strip of bacon.  It was all cooked well enough but this visit just rubbed me wrong.   I was at the Kingman, AZ location a few days ago and had exactly the opposite experience so , you know, hit or miss with these chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Way below average, and fell far below expectations.    Came with a party of 7....2 peoples food came out 10 min before the rest, and sat there getting cold.  I specifically asked if I could get the Philly cheesesteak omelet with onions, but no peppers, and was told no problem, but when I received, there were no onions included.  Asked for coffee numerous times before getting refills.  My 4 yo ordered his French toast with no bananas, but they put them on anyway.  Food was mediocre at best.  If you can't serve a party of 7 people at once, get simple orders correct, refill coffee and water, then I think you need to find a different line of work."}
{"text":"It's okay for Denny's.  I don't usually go to places like this unless I have had a lot to drink and it's 2:30 am, and if I was 15 years younger.  Quick breakfast, a little greasy though.  Mildly comforting while eating though."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, and it's really a mixed bag of what you're going to get. Some days the food takes forever to come out, sometimes it's really quick. Sometimes you get a really nice waitress, other times they almost completely ignore you. The food is ok, I've never been disappointed but I've never really been amazed either."}
{"text":"Great place to have a quick bite. Breakfast is always good and they even have healthy options, just ask"}
{"text":"One of the worst Denny's ever! I don't know if it's because your location is in Mesa, but ya have rude and bad customer service! Whoever the guy manager that was on duty did not once acknowledged any guest walking thru those doors."}
{"text":"I did not know that a small breakfast could cost so much. Several things on the menu were under $10, IE Club Sandwich with fries, omelettes, etc. I ordered two eggs, hash browns and coffee and it came to $9.88, two eggs were $4. Must be way more expensive to buy ala cart than purchase something that the cooks had to put together.  This will be the last time I go to Denny's for anything simple."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot ANYTIME, i especially love the breakfast slam and my kids really like the pancakes. Not to crazy about the wait but the staff was friendly and did a great job. This place is also one of the only 24 diners left so it's also great for a late night bite or after the bar."}
{"text":"Extremely S-L-O-W service it took 5 minutes to seat me and I was the only one there.. 10 minutes later, not even an inquiry if I would like a beverage , there were wait staff present and talking amongst themselves and drinking beverages of their own.. but no service for me after 15 minutes of being INVISIBLE .. I left I will be sure to inform the THOUSANDS of fans I perform for to avoid this location like the fkn plague if I could rate you less than zero I would.. This is one SWAMP that needs to be drained .."}
{"text":"Super long wait, seated people who came in after us and once seated, watched them serve people who sat down after us .. Service was reflected in tip"}
{"text":"This is thE USUAL ITEMS I GET ! Every time I order soup it's a PROBLEM! I come often to get chicken noodle soup for my two children and myself. It's always an issue. I just ordered over the phone for the usual amount of soups..3!! They gave me one and told me I only orders one.. how ? When I been doing this always. The only person I've ever gotten amazing service from was BLEU! I love next to dennys but I definitely will have to get a new soup place. Poor quality, Mediocre customer service, and a lot of waitresses with attitudes and people answering phones \"taking orders\" who do not know how to use the system. If I could have no stars, I would have."}
{"text":"It's Denny's.  I've eaten at this one for many years, and through several changes in management, simply because it is conveniently located near my house.   The restaraunt is laid out well, with two main wings (one of which used to be smoking back in the day) so things don't get to noisy, even if it is crowded.     Food is adequate for Denny's (their pancakes and sandwiches have always been pretty tasty) though the quality of the service tends to be a dice roll depending on if you get a new server or not.   This location is generally kept clean so as long as you aren't expecting the world, it's a good place to hit when you want the sit down experience but don't have a lot of extra money to spend."}
{"text":"Worst customer service i have ever received. I went to eat breakfast with my family and the hostess told me there was a 25 minute wait which was cool.  Yet we waited more then 45 minutes to be seated and people that had arrived after us were seated. And then on top of that after we sat down at our table they took another 30 minutes just to order our drinks. The food was great but it should not take that long to have our drinks ordered. Also i understand it was busy but dont tell me there is only a 25 minute wait and then make me and my family wait almost an hour."}
{"text":"So the food was alright, not bad I guess. We got what we paid for especially on Christmas night being that it was Christmas Night. I would say that the waiters need to be more knowledgeable on online orders, meaning actually check on the status of them."}
{"text":"Denny's is a staple for late-night fare. Where else can you load up on pancakes and cheese fries at 3:00 a.m.?"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service and staff this morning. There is some type of staff dispute that you can get wind of spilling over to the customers. Despite there being more staff than tables we couldn't get refills on items. Our server spilled coffee on our table and didn't clean it up. There  as no manager on the floor. We weren't given our check by our server but rather I had to stare down the cashier who eventually brought it to us. I wish I had anything positive to say but there was no excuse for our experience. Staff issues should not spill over to customers and there is no excuse for leaving your tables alone for so long when you don't have others coming in."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and, both times, I was not even slightly amused.  The first time was about four years ago and the food was dry, extremely small-portioned, and not flavorful at all...the most recent time was about a month ago and I had better expectations (as so much time had passed since the first visit).  All that I can remember from the most recent visit is how disgusting the coffee was. I conferred with others at my table to ensure I wasn't being too critical - and they agreed that it was horrible...so I actually requested it be removed from my bill.  Needless to say, I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"I went here on my birthday to have the Grand Slam they offer for free. I live up the street so why not? I haven't been to a Denny's in years because now you \"assemble\" your Grand Slam instead of it coming as is. Anyway, I was seated right away by a gentleman that was one of the servers. This black gentleman seems to have a bad attitude for whatever reason. He didn't say anything rude to me but his vibe and actions gave me that impression. The server that helped me was very nice and she came by frequently to make sure I was ok on coffee. I was there for a few hours because I was doing some research on something else on my own. Because of the time I was there, it gave me a chance to see they really never got busy which is odd because of where they're located. Anyway, aside from the one server, I had a pleasant experience based on my server and how good the food was. Management, if you happen to read this or any of the other negative reviews, you should make changes because in my reading it seems everything is spelled out exactly as to what the  things wrong are in your restaurant. This location should be busier and I think the things stated in those bad reviews as well as mine are the reasons it's not."}
{"text":"Staff was so disrespectful loudly complaining about management and customers. The salad was almost all bad lettuce that was Brown and wilty...I would never serve something so old. Service was slow but they were busy so I could understand the time it took. We won't go back"}
{"text":"Dulce was very nice server.   My pancakes came out last but were very good. My hash brown and eggs came out first and wasn't warm. Was busy so, I didn't bother to complain. Other than that was good. So 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"When this Denny's opened, the wait staff was attentive, fast, and the food was good.  All of it.  But, over the past few months, things have gone down hill.  All of them.  The service is very spotty (there are two wait staff who deserve commendation).  But usually, they are very slow with refills on drinks, if at all.  Then there are the incorrect orders.  I've had to send my food back 2 out of 3 times in the past few weeks.  Cold clam chowder (not even tepid). An avocado chicken salad had 2 very small slices of avocado and wilted/brown lettuce.  The wait staff, when you can find them, are usually huddled around the host station talking.  The managers are not helpful.  The only thing that happens quickly at this location are getting the check and paying.  I give credit when it is due but this poorest review is well deserved.  Whoever was responsible for quality control when this location opened needs to come back and clean things up."}
{"text":"Food definitely represent cultures!   I went to this store twice in a row with my two girl friends. The only thing you need to order is \"Bourbon Bacon Burger.\"  They were so good!"}
{"text":"It was about 230 am or so and I needed to refuel with cheap coffee and overly fried foods. Decisions, decisions!! Dennys, I hop, or waffle house?? Dennys it was!! If I chose according to feel good food, waffle Casa was a no brainer and if I had a fix for some fatcakes smothered with confectionary crack then ihop reigns supreme. After 2 the bars/clubs are emptied out and late night diners get rushed so I chose Dennnys for the service alone. Adam was there, as per usual, to  make my experience flow smoothly. When im that hungry Im more interested in getting my food in the quickest way possible so it adds that much more to my meal to have it arrive with charisma and a smile."}
{"text":"Went in with a group of 5 people around 10:30pm on Saturday night. For the late hour the restaurant wasn't packed except for a few scattered diners here and there. Even though our waiter had a nice personality, service was slow. Refills took forever, plus kept getting the wrong refills (originally ordered an iced tea but kept getting Coke even though it was pointed out). Also, one of the drinks came out w/a hair on the whip cream and our waiter caught it before setting it down on the table. Instead of getting a completely new drink, only the half of the hair whip was removed & more added on top causing the whip to melt all over the side of the mug. One of the coffee mugs was also dirty. I guess it's probably because we went late at night, but we witnessed a couple verbally fighting in the dining room. No attempt was made to ask the couple to step outside even though there were children around. I most likely will not go back to this location and/or this time at night."}
{"text":"To;Dr: slow service, mediocre food. Wouldn't recommend unless you're craving all day breakfast at some ungodly time (open 24/7).   Came in around 9pm for a late dinner with friends. We waited too long to be greeted, seated, and served. It was hard pressed to flag down a waiter. The didn't look like they were paying too much attention to the customers. We joked that we probably needed to do something scandalous to have a waiter show up.  I ordered a supreme skillet ($11.95) with sausages, baby spinach, Roma tomatoes, mushrooms, red bell peppers, potatoes with 2 over easy eggs. The ingredients were mostly well proportioned - there was slightly more potatoes compared to the other ingredients. It was a little too salty, though taste wasn't bad.    My friend orders an avocado chicken Caesar salad and the first thought that came to my mind was \"that's a sad looking salad\". The Caesar salad came with mushy avocados and lukewarm chicken basically thrown across the salad (as opposed to nicely sliced and plated). The salad didn't even have crotons. The salad dressing was very heavy and there was a lot of it. The salad kind of dopped and sagged on the plate. Presentation 0/10.   Portions at this place is fair, slightly on the smaller side. I'd argue you'd walk away from your meal at least \"not hungry\" anymore. Interior is diner style, as it is to be expected. Theres a wide selection on the menu ranging from classic breakfast dishes to burgers and stakes."}
{"text":"Very busy on Saturday mornings. Despite being a party of six, we were able to find a table in no more than 10 minutes. Your waiter will not be the one who will take out your order so make sure you are very clear with any special requests. They will not double check your orders. We had 5/6 orders with mistakes. Staff were quick to fix the errors. If you are ever seated near the entrance to the outside seating area, ask to be seated elsewhere. It is quite disruptive whenever the waiters and patrons enter and leave, especially when they forget to shut the door. Food quality is what is what you'll expect from a Denny's. Always love their pancakes... even the new recipe."}
{"text":"Okay, I need to get this off of my chest. I went into the restroom not expecting much (knowing Denny's) but not expecting this either. Upon entering, the only open stall was littered with paper, but there was no toilet paper in sight! I literally had to break into their rusty supply closet to get more toilet paper. By now, you're probably thinking, what about the stall next over? Or, what about paper towels? Well let me tell you. The lady in the stall next over was having the time of life at Niagara Falls and would not stop grunting every five seconds. It made me so uncomfortable. There also wasn't any paper towels. So, after breaking into the supply closet, I finally got toilet paper. You're welcome, next person to go into said stall. The food was Denny's-esque. That's all I've got to say."}
{"text":"Nice guy seated us and then our server brought us water and then continued to ignore us, we didn't get to order because she wouldn't come back to the table for over 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Each year I go to a conference here and decide to eat at Denny's.  Most of the time its pretty typical... nothing too special.  This week I ate here twice.  The first time the waitress was extremely good and fun.  We had a good time messing with her.  Food we had was also good and nothing to complain about.  The second time I ate here (later in the week) the waitress was ok.  However, I'd have to say that I give them credit with the service.  I was treated well by at least 3 or 4 different people who work there.  The place was packed and yet they had great service.  Note - Much cheaper to eat here than at the buffets :-)"}
{"text":"Cold food the steak too cocked and salty. The rice is rough. I was hungry but this steak is bad in taste and temperature. I will not come back again"}
{"text":"Happy Birthday to me. Dennys provides a FREE grand slam breakfast on your birthday. I felt very pampered. My server was wonderful and wished me happy birthday and pointed out my options for the free breakfast. I ended up getting English muffins, hashbrowns, two large pancakes and bacon. There was no charge, not even tax. I did leave a tip, but other than that I had a feast of a brunch for free. The server was efficient, yet friendly. The food was very good. The place looked clean. Parking was close to the door. The decor and facility was typical of older Denny's and looks a little tired."}
{"text":"This is a review for Tammy (grave yard shift) you are an awesome waitress do not forget that. Her service was amazing despite the ignorant people tonight. Yes you were the only server i understood. What matters is that your customer service and your ability to serve us we are grateful. Thank you so much Tammy!! And for that my husband and i will be back the food was amazing and your service to serve us. You made it feel like home. You are a wonderful person."}
{"text":"Went to this Denny's after work at 2am. The server was amazing but the surroundings wasn't. Food was good."}
{"text":"OK ok your probably wondering why someone on the elite squad is bothering to mention Dennys. I'm here to champion something I feel is worth championing. The Grand Slam breakfast has been around for years and years and yet Dennys seems to be shrinking in popularity.  There are not many around anywhere. Dennys has several versuons of the Grand Slam. The Grand Slam Slugger is my personal favorite. Where here else can you get two eggs cooked anyway you want, two bacon strips, two sausages links, toast, pancakes, a huge glass of juice or v8 plus coffee for 8 bucks? Yes it's true. This is not a special, it's on their everyday menu. Clean, fast service, no hassle, consistent food and service, reasonably priced. Plenty of free parking. I'd say Dennys is poised for a big comeback. Next to and in front of Kohls."}
{"text":"No wonder it was 2.5 stars !!!! Horrible customer service ! I waited almost 40 minutes for an omelette !!! And after he brought it, the bacons were burnt so did the English muffins dried and burnt ! The omelette also was not cooked right. They were busy and didn't have enough staff. I don't really like denny's but sometimes I go there but this location was the worst and I would never ever ever go to this location again. Never !!!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience ever last night. Went to this Denny's late like around midnight. It was packed! So me and my friend decided to order for take out. We asked could we place an order the waitress so very rudely told us that when someone is free, they would come and take our order. The waitress came and took our order and we sat for 30 minutes. My friend went to check our order and the waitress came over and told us they were out of mashed potatoes (my friend ordered pot roast). Then 10 minutes later the waitress came over and told us they were out of gravy so he changed his order and got a club sandwich. 10 minutes later he asked about the order and they hadn't even started it yet. So he said he didn't want it anymore and where was my veggie omelette and the cook said \"What veggie omelette?\" We just said never mind and left without any sort of apology or compensation for our time. We were starving because it was the only place open that late! Bad, bad, bad!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and were not impressed. The food was adequate at best. We left half of it. Very expensive for what it was and the quality. Service was terrible. We waited forever to order. I think the waitress forgot we were even there. Never once offered to top up the coffee. Don't bother with Denny's for breakfast. Take a short walk to the Sunset Grill. You will get MUCH better food, for a better price, with GREAT service."}
{"text":"They are usually very understaffed and are clueless. I try to avoid this location as much as possible. It seems that Denny's has gotten a lot more expensive for the quality of food and service that you get.   I'd head to the IHOP across the street."}
{"text":"Well the table being clean has been the biggest problem so far when we come. Everytime. The food is on point so far and service is ok depending on who does it."}
{"text":"Why the worst experiences at a Denny's it was slow the service was badd the food was badd we paid for everything we felt we shouldn't have but we just left wrote it off buyer beware"}
{"text":"So, the employee at Denny's was really rude to me from the start.. when I was ordering I changed my mind because she wouldn't let me substitute a waffle into a \"create your own grand slam\" thing. She says \"does your friend always act this way??\" to Lyndsi because I had to change my order quickly and was nervous. THEN, I politely asked for a new english muffin because mine was smothered in butter. I really dont like butter at all unless it's an extremely small amount. She said all the other food (hash brown, turkey bacon, and egg) were also cooked in butter and I told her that I'd try and eat it so she wouldn't have to make the kitchen remake it. She was so rude about getting another English muffin, I could hear her loudly talking about me in the back like it was such a hastle to get a new english muffin without butter. She brang it back to the table in such a rude mannor and then never returned to the table again while coming to everyone else's several times. When we notified another employee that we needed a box and asked how we check out, he told us he'd get the waitress. When he told the waitress, she loudly said from the back \"well they're gonna have to wait\". then when she came to check us out at the register, she gave me the most sarcastic yet agressive and scalding \"have a nice night. merry christmas\" I ever could received. She HATED my guts. Hated them."}
{"text":"Service is slow and just generally sucks. Don't expect to have a quick meal here with speedy quality service. I know this is just Dennys but c'mon! I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes to flag someone down to order or get a drink refill.   If you order to go double check your order before you leave. They don't put butter or syrup in the bag if you get pancakes to go and they always forget to make any changes you request even if you paid more for it (for example, add cheese) Not to mention the food is greasier here than any other Denny's I've ever been too.   1/5 you might as well go to another Dennys and not waste your time and money."}
{"text":"This Dennys is my favorite. They have a great location, great food and great management. I've been coming here for many years, and they remain outstanding and consistant. I hope they are around for many years to come."}
{"text":"I love this place!  We have eaten here multiple times and have always had great service whether it's middle of the week or a slammed Saturday morning breakfast. Food is always out fast and hot. Keep in mind it is a Denny's after all and I've been to them all over the country and have to say we love coming back here!"}
{"text":"Avoid like the plague!  Went with five girls for a economical brunch before hitting the pool/slots. Everything was terrible about this place- so bad that I  made a severe mental note to warn THE OTHERS on Yelp before they made this tragic mistake.  We ordered our meals and a few of us ordered coffees. The waitress came on the other side of the table and told my cousins to \"slide those coffees over there will ya\" to me and my sister. Totally rude. Then, she said \"the bread is getting toasted it's coming\" after we asked where the bread was. Ten minutes later she comes out and says \"oh there actually was no bread but here! take this garlic bread instead\".   The garlic bread was literally seeped in a garlic broth and microwaved, so my sister was the only one with balls to ask for just bread and butter instead. When the waitress came back, chunks of butter were thrown onto untoasted white bread. Ridic.  I'm not one to complain, but I usually LOVE Denny's and have never had an issue with it back home. The meals we got were literally slapped onto the plate, half-assed, and small. This Denny's made my heart die a little inside.  Waitresses never refilled our coffee, disappeared, and we had to go to the kitchen to find someone to pay our bill.   Tip had the shape of a donut. A small angry donut."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed in my service today at Denny's. This is the second time going to this Denny's and the first time I tried to excuse the terrible service since they just opened so that is why I gave them another chance today and my service was worse than before. The attitude of the server was horrible, she obviously wasn't trained in professionalism. My dish had so many mistakes. The man who I believe to be the manager (a larger Caucasian man) was a sarcastic prick and decided it would be appropriate to tell someone while they are waiting over 25 min for there food to take a lap around the building and by the time I would get back it'd be done. The disrespect was absolutely disgraceful. Definitely not returning to this Denny's. I will make sure to inform everyone I know not to go to avoid the disgusting attitudes as well. Sadly Denny's used to be a cute diner to enjoy breakfast anytime with family but now I wouldn't even take my dog.  Server name: (according to receipt) Sierra H Restaurant #9321"}
{"text":"The food and pricing everyone knows at this point. Here's what everyone doesn't know:  the staff is exceptional. We came in with all four of our kids and Renee and Jessica were exceptionally kind, friendly and took the time to talk to the kids. Too many times these days people act as if children are an inconvenience and shouldn't be let out of the house. Jessica came over and talked to each kid and asked about them. Renee took the time to listen to what cup they all wanted and made sure to differentiate them. It's not every day you see service like this. Thank you to Denny's for hiring those two!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible!! I sat at the counter and watched my food sit under the heat lamp for over 5 minutes before it was brought to me . The waitress never came back to see if I wanted anything else.( I did, by the way). She never even refilled my ice tea. I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our server was great. Very friendly and accommodating. We have 1 year old twins. The booster seats were all broken. The high chair straps weren't on and they were super dirty. Ok, we have wipes for that. I go io the bathroom and the floor was absolutely disgusting. I don't know why I go to any Denny's. I know I hate it, but this was exceptionally bad."}
{"text":"We went were so pleasantly /Surprised by the Service and Server.  Refilled Coffee-Food was hot (not barely warm)  I was spoiled by more boutique type spots-but after a long hard \"Move\"--we were wanting Fast cheap and we got all the above I do wish they would get the COFFEE BAR LIKE THEY HAVE AT THE 101 BY THE HARKINS-- It was Awesome --Starbuck Style Drinks about $1 less!! Apparently its a \"Trial\"--I hope more people Try it and Urge Dennys to put them in the Busy ones--!! We would have ordered one to leave with !! Pay Attention Denny's Management - I am right about this --the Coffee Bar would be a 3-4 Dollar Check Add On--that would stand out in Tempe - -In Scottsdale People are stuck on Starbucks--"}
{"text":"Not the best Denny's I've been to. It was empty and not busy at all. It seemed as if they had no employees because the manager was the same person taking our order and serving my friend and I. It's super quiet a little to quiet, like a run down saloon in the old west. The service was mediocre and the server didn't ask us what we would like to drink. Overall Denny's is great, just not this location."}
{"text":"So I thought I would explain that I am lactose intolerant. Tonight I decided to drink a gallon of milk and when I went to the bathroom this Denny's is what come out of my behind. You guessed it I think it is a big pile of poopy. Lauren whoever you are, I would like to meet you."}
{"text":"Amazing staff very friendly. Had a great experience  on a friday night no less ! 1/27/2017  Was greated instantly and brought drinks right away. Very attentive server (christian) great food and was even checked on by the manager (Raul). Will definitely be returning to this location !"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews nor get mad at bad service. But my experience here last night wow. I was seated pretty quickly 1 star. After that sat for 20 min as 3-4 servers passed by with out a drink order. I actually stated a timer after 20 min I walked to the front and spoke to the \" manager \" he said oh where were you sitting I pointed out he said \" sorry\" and continued on behind the register.  Time was close to 12am and I get it it was kinda busy but not even half full and plenty of staff. I was so disappointed I didn't get anything else out of him but a sorry. Wow hope he is written up demoted for such horrible management."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and never have a complaint. The staff is amazing and the food is always good! Today our waiter was Joseph and he is the friendliest person we have ever met!"}
{"text":"The food was very terrible on Christmas Eve, so was the service. I ordered a T-bone steak and it was cooked extremely well done when I asked for medium-well. I asked the server to return the steak for chicken tenders, and they still charged me for my over cooked steak"}
{"text":"Kind of not happy with this place, but there are some things I do like about it.   At first, being greeted and being seated was okay. The usual greet and seat routine like any other Denny's out there. It wasn't busy at all, but the fact, that it took them long to get things rolling, kind of boggles me. You have three other staff standing around, doing nothing, while this poor waitress is like running around, trying to get things done. Now, I really don't blame our waitress, cause at least she was nice. But the others who are just standing around, making her do all the work, was kind of rude. Of course, that's what makes this review a poor review. But I will give credit, where credit is due.   I know, that Denny's have certain sections for wait staff to cover. I applaud our waitress for taking the busiest one and trying to make sure everyone is happy. While I see another section that has one booth with set of family, while our waitress has like 6 other booth to cover. Now, it would be nice, to share responsibilities, then to see the other waitress be snooty, and stare at our waitress, while she's all over the place. Even though when our waitress went to break, the other waitress wouldn't even check on us to see how we were doing. Like, she's only allowed to cover one booth in her section, where there's like 6 other booth, that doesn't have a waitress. What kind of place, does that, where you have no one to cover a section, when its some ones break time, but have three others in uniform. and the manager or who ever that lady was, just to stand there with the other snooty waitress and talk behind our waitress back, on how our she's is doing. I say, if you want the job done right, then do it yourself, cause right now, you have unhappy customers, and these wait staff isn't backing up any ones section. What a way to run a business.   As far as food goes, I did like the Zesty nachos, I did like my Super Bird sandwich. But didn't like the fact, that they weren't cooking something that they had on their menu cause,  they tend to be out of it. Some one should of said something, or inform our waitress, instead of making her come back, to get another order, that they still didn't have. So the third time around, she came back, saying they didn't have what the wife wants, so we went with a second Super Bird. That right there, tells me that there's a lack of communication between the cook and our waitress. The fact that the cook did not inform the waitress what they can or cannot do, is the cooks fault. Then to talk to the head manager or who ever that was, to make the waitress look bad in front of everyone, is totally uncalled for. If a staff got a complaint about another staff, take it where, no one else could see your upset face or hand gestures.    Now, again, I applaud our waitress for doing more then she did that day, and covered what she covered. I blame the other staff for lack of help, lack of support, and lack of communication. Knowing that the other section only has one booth to cover, while our waitress had 6, is unappropriate.   With that being said, with the waitstaff being snooty and the cook having lack of communication skills on what they can or cannot do. I wouldn't really come back to eat here again, if they treat their staff the way they treated our waitress.  Very unprofessional on their part."}
{"text":"It's Denny's.  They stay in business because you know what you're going to get. And even though there is bound to be some local place that's better, there are also bound to be local places that are worse. So you're here for the safety of the choice, not the chance for greatness.  This particular Denny's isn't bad. Neighborhood is sketchy. And the building itself isn't exactly sparkly and fresh. But the food is what you expect and the service is good. You can be 60 years old and still be one of the younger people in the place. I had breakfast and it was just what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I just had breakfast there with a friend after hanging out at the Fremont Experience.  Our server, Courtney, was very attentive and had a great attitude with a big beautiful smile.  She was quick to serve us and was very helpful.  I will definitely be back to this Dennys when in town.  I hope management reads this and recognizes what an asset she is."}
{"text":"How do you burn pancakes and have the server bring them to you table? There were two people that saw they were burnt. It's pathetic that we only ordered pancakes and you ruined them. You both had one job and neither one of you were willing to do it.  Before we could say anything to the server she said ( they are burnt). Are you kidding me? Get a clue!"}
{"text":"Damn good breakfast just the right portion. This location has the best staff and food quality by far."}
{"text":"Woke up with a huge appetite and the $2/4/6/8 menu did the job.  $2 for biscuits n gravy with crispy hash browns satisfied my need for some carbs.  Very large portion for 2 bucks.  Try to beat that at Micky D's.  Dennys coffee is AAAA+ too."}
{"text":"$4 Value Slam gets 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 eggs. Perfect balance. Good food A+ service. Keeps me away from cooking at home. Winning."}
{"text":"Convenient Strip location.  But not convenient parking unless you valet since its on the Tahiti Village property.  No biggie I enjoyed the walk.  Great Value slam as usual fast service and for 4 bucks, a great power up breakfast. Yay Dennys"}
{"text":"The waitress was standing at the door waiting to greet us with cigarette smoke and all when we walked up. Not my favorite way to start a meal. The food itself deserves a 3/5 but given a dirty facility and wait staff. I rate this place a 2/5. Have only gone back on Christmas Day, when everything in an 8 mile radius was closed."}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for a late-night meal near Eaton Centre last weekend, and stopped in at the 24-hour Denny's at Dundas + Bay. It wasn't too busy, so service was pretty quick. The restaurant is what you would expect, bright and clean, but nothing special inside.  As for food, I had the Super Bird sandwich, turkey breast with melted Swiss cheese and bacon on grilled sourdough bread with a side of seasoned fries and a strawberry milkshake. The sandwich was pretty good, the fries were okay but not much different than regular fries, the milkshake was good too. I think my total was about $18 (I wasn't the one paying this time).  Overall no surprises, good enough for a late meal and I have previously been here for a decent breakfast, but nothing to stand out from other similar restaurants. I probably would not go downtown just to eat there, but I'm sure I'll go back sometime when I'm around the area."}
{"text":"Service wad extremely slow with lots of open tables.  I waited about 30 mins.  Im not a fan of Dennys but my mom loves it so we went.  Our waitress was very  Nice but good was alright I guess.  My whole wheat peacan pancakes were very dry.  Best part were the bananas on top. My mother ordered the skillet with potatoes sausage and that I can say was tasty. Maybe I'll order that if she forces me to go.  Prices werent to bad I guess."}
{"text":"So we have been coming to this Dennys a few times a month for well over 10 years. We have always had good food & service until the other night.   A Friday evening, a little past 6pm. Somewhat busy but not crazy. We ordered our coffee. And waited. Coffee was old and burnt. Took forever for a refill. We had ordered mozzarella sticks & burgers. Sometime after 7:00 we got our mozzarella sticks and our server said \"there's a backup in the kitchen.\" Ok. Why did it take an hour to say anything? Lots of servers standing around or bringing food to people who arrived after us? We finally got our dinners.  Fries were ice cold. burgers luke warm, not very good. Server never checked back. Had to go to the register and ask for the check. By now it is 8:00pm. Never saw the manager. Posted a concern on their survey sight, never heard a thing back. Not thinking I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Halfway through my new ultimate spicy skillet, there was no potatoes half of my plate was gone before I even started! The only crazy think about this skillet is that half of it was gone when it got to my table! Why Denny's why I'm always here why this time??"}
{"text":"Bad service. 30min to get a table at 6am. My order didn't arrive till I call the waitress twice."}
{"text":"Good food here. Probably one of the best Denny's locations I've been to. The only reason this doesn't have 5 stars is because the table was kinda sticky. The food was awesome though! Our waitress was cool."}
{"text":"Ugh! Luckily there's another Dennys at Craig Marketplace -  The difference is unreal!"}
{"text":"Well, that was disappointing.   After we ordered our server said \"it's going to be 3 forevers before the foods done\" and walked away.  Then I had to send my over-hard egg back because it was running - oh, twice.  Didn't bother w a 3rd attempt, get me outta here!   He was right, it was 3 forever before the food came. The manager was nice.  I mean, it is Dennys, slack given."}
{"text":"This was a nice Denny's.  Looks like parking might be an issue sometimes, but we found a spot and dinner and service were up to par with the other best Denny's we've been to.  Clean restaurant and nice staff."}
{"text":"Loved my brunch here! Service was so fast and friendly ! Cant go wrong with the skillets and breakfast! Pancakes were so fluffy and yummy!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good after a early morning of Black Friday shopping. The waitress was slow in bringing our check."}
{"text":"stopped at dennys 2day had a cheese burger and fries,burger was under seasoned and over cook ,wont go back"}
{"text":"We only eat salads and \"real food\" at home, but every once in a long while, we're treating ourselves to an old-fashioned American experience at a restaurant/fast food joint.  We had the avocado bacon burger with fries, coffee, double berry blueberry pancakes w/ hash browns, bacon, and scrambled eggs, and two vanilla cream pancake kid meals. Everyone liked their meal, and everything but the fruit toppings was apparently made fresh to order.    The pancakes were loaded with fresh blueberries! We ended up almost fighting over the fries and hash browns, they were that good! Our server, Olivia, was friendly and on top of things. Tables were clean. No complaints. We walked in expecting a Denny's experience, and we got exactly what we wanted. Thank you, Denny's!  ***They're currently giving one free kid meal for every adult meal you order, I think from 4pm-10pm M-F!"}
{"text":"Food was good..Syrup tasted a little watered down but otherwise no complaints..Our waitress was good and attentive. 15 % off for AARP which makes it even better"}
{"text":"I mean, it's Dennys. We had a bit of a wait for breakfast, but not long. They sat us at a table for 2 next to a larger table and the tables were about an inch apart so it felt like we were sitting with them and it was a bit awkward. Skip the bacon.  It's that paper thin microwave-type kind. Pancakes and hash browns were good.  Server was friendly and prompt with refills.  Overall, not a bad inexpensive meal on the strip."}
{"text":"We come here usually twice a month. Great customer services. The manager is great. After the renovation this place became perfect. One of the best Denny's in town."}
{"text":"Consistently terrible service (even for a Denny's) at this location. I hadn't been for years because I have always had such awful service here, but after a winning streak at several surrounding Denny's, I thought I'd give \"the bad Denny's\" a try again.  Bad mistake. We left before even ordering food and I won't be back again. Went across the street to Olive Garden, which really knows how to elevate mediocre food with excellent service.  If you hate food, enjoy depressing scenes of humanity and waiting endlessly for service that doesn't arrive, this is the Denny's of your dreams.  All snotty snark aside, the server was very genuinely apologetic for the bad service. I actually felt bad for her. Just not bad enough to waste sixty dollars on awful food.  Nice try, Denny's."}
{"text":"I have to say how disgusted I am ..my daughter and friends went here after homecoming .. 10 min to get seated .... 20 min for drink order ... 5 min drinks came .. 10 min later they took their order ... still no food for an hour .. I'm heated what was suppose to be an amazing night ended in disgust .. I called the store and the number is no longer in service .. I told her to get the manager on her cell phone and she said no ones around there all in back .. seriously .... funny because I told her make sure she tips well because I'm sure when the server sees kids is stereotyping.. I been working in customer service for 20 plus years this is unacceptable"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this Denny's. The entire experience was perfect. The host, tony, was really friendly. Our server, Rebecca, was super nice, and quick, and stayed on top of things. The music was enjoyable, the chairs and tables were very contemporary, instead of the typical Denny's diner type booths...   I got my free birthday breakfast, which was awesome. I was also able to have a fricken Bloody Mary, because they have a full bar! I was happy to go to Denny's and look through the menu and see that they didn't jack up their prices because they knew they could. The menu prices were the same as any Denny's anywhere, and I think that was awesome.   I will absolutely be back. Of course, because I'm obese as f*ck. :D"}
{"text":"If u bring ur kids between 4-10 pm they get free kids meal with one entry purchase, so that will save u $$$"}
{"text":"Holy crap! I know that it is Denny's and the bar is set low to begin with, but damn. After waiting over 5 minutes to even be acknowledged by a server, as I sit with my 8 year old grandson I have to ask for a children's menu. Before asking if I want a beverage I'm asked if I'm ready to order. When my lukewarm coffee FINALLY arrives (must've been stuck in customs) my server who genuinely seems to want to be elsewhere deigns to take my order.   I am usually ok with Denny's. I don't have 5 star expectations, but is hot coffee too much to ask for?"}
{"text":"Even though it's extremely busy the ladies are still so patient , kind, and attentive . We were seated pretty quickly and our waitress Hilda checked up on us the perfect amount of times ."}
{"text":"Not a big Denny's fan ...but let me tell you this place gives you greatest value for your $ on the strip. If budget conscious or over 55 ask for their budget menus & Over 55 menu options."}
{"text":"Someone should send the health inspectors into this place because I never have been in a situation where I almost SHIT MY PANTS AFTER EATING for the SECOND WEEK IN A ROW!  I don't know if its the mocha drizzled coffee, or the grand slam I ordered. But I had a major case of the number 2 emergency around 20 minutes after consuming the food. This happened not ONCE but TWICE!  The first time it happened, I was like, okay... maybe the kitchen was busy breaking down for closing and perhaps they unknowingly undercooked the food. However, there was almost no one in the restaurant, it was just me and my girlfriend at the time inside, and a another couple that was already finishing their meal.   But you know what, for the SECOND TIME, both me and my gf had to run into the bathroom at College of Southern Nevada after consuming the food.   I was humiliated after I was caught up by my friends who was taking their sweet assed time telling their long fucking story to me. Like, my ass is BURNING with anticipation to drop these fiery bombs in the toilet, and these fuckers that I know didn't realize the EMERGENCY I was in!  I had to excuse myself to go to the bathroom, but even the follow-up experience in the stall was painful and miserable. Like, my stomach STUNG like crazy while I was blowing up the bathroom. And it flowed out just like water!  That night, I made 4 more trips to the restroom during my night class.  Seriously, send in the fucking health department! I too, work in a restaurant as a line cook, and regardless of whether or not it is a Fast Casual Dining or a Breakfast Spot, experiences like this is NOT FUCKING ACCEPTABLE."}
{"text":"This place is called Americas Diner but it is such an embarrassment to America.  I came here for the first time for lunch on my birthday and I received the most tasteless food I've ever had in my life. My cat eats better.   If you sign up for the newsletter then you receive a free Grand Slam on your birthday but don't even bother, it has no flavor.   The staff is friendly but pushy when it comes to putting in your order. They constantly ask you if you like the food which makes me think that they are aware that the food tastes bad.   The food tasted like it was microwaved and I found a bone in my steak biscuit. They add generous amounts of salt to the food too. Like really generous.   The location and of this place is really sketchy with drunk people hanging out in the parking lot all day long. The place looks really run down and the decor is very outdated.   The food is overpriced for the quality that you get, it literally tastes like salted paper.   I'm never coming back to a Denny's. If I could give zero stars then I would."}
{"text":"Very good. Great breakfast at a reasonable price. We went about 830 each morning and there was no wait. But by 9-930 they were getting slammed."}
{"text":"Denny's is a good reference to have dinner. Our waiter take very good care of us (didn't even have to ask to drink refills). Food was good."}
{"text":"If I can give Zero I would!!! Negative zero! This resturaunt was absolutely horrible customer service. The waitress practically threw toast and be and disnt even bother picking it up..just walked away with \"Oh ill get you a new one\". Once I got my toast back it was cold bread with butter. I would never come here again. Her name was Shantelle."}
{"text":"Just an average Dennys, nothing outstanding about it. Servings were adequate, location was easy to get to on a main drag. Service was OK, quality of food was average. They do have a TV do you can watch news or sports. Price was reasonable. Good for families with kids."}
{"text":"They would have got 3 stars but my French toast was just not good. Soggy and cold food isn't really what I was in the mood for. My server James I believe was his name was friendly enough but he could not overshadow the lack of flavor in the food."}
{"text":"I went in about 45 minutes ago and the service was absolutely HORRIBLE. The server was so slow, I didn't get greeted, silverware, menus, or my drinks before waiting 20 minutes before walking out and having to go to another location. What makes it even worse was their was no one in the restaurant. I don't understand how this dude even has a job. Get your shit together and find better employees."}
{"text":"I must admit, that I have not been a big fan of Denny's in the past. I can only think of wraps one of the time in my many years that I've ever dined at one of these restaurants. However since my father was in town and he wanted to try Denny's as they were one of the chain restaurants celebrating and honoring veterans, that we gave them a try.  I must admit I have nothing negative to say about my experience with Denny's, in fact only laudatory comments. Their staff was very responsive, courteous, and well in charge of the massive amount of people that they had visit their location that morning,  They're piping hot breakfast of scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, grits and toast was delicious, suiting my palate well. The coffee was just okay not as hot as I normally like it, but helped in my Awakening process. All in all, Denny's was impressive that morning, worthy of my return visit and subsequent business."}
{"text":"This is the worst missmanaged Denny's ever , you can go in every Denny's in scottsdale the max wait will be 10-15 min , but at this Denny's you need to wait at least 50 minutes to one hour 20 minutes to place order and get served and it is not the first time but third time that we come here and this place is is below 0 stars believe me or try it yourself.    Somebody needs to do something about it"}
{"text":"Not my first choice  I enjoy eating at Dennys on ocassion. I am always greeted quickly, seated almost immediately, and the food has always been somewhat good.  However, this Denny's just is not one of my favorites. The service is poor and the food just wasn't very good. It took over 30 minutes to get an order of Pancakes and the place wasn't very crowded.  When  I asked for warm syrup it was given to me in a bottle that had about an inch thick of crust around the lid.  Needless to say I wasn't using that syrup that day.   All in all Dennys offers good value for your money, reasonable prices, and short waits (except on Sunday mornings). If your looking for a quick and reasonable breakfast, stop by, just dont stop bt this Dennys."}
{"text":"I just want to start this review by saying if you want a really good late night meal, this is the place for you!  Now, when it comes to the service, they should be ashamed! I am a server myself, and have been for 5+ years! I pride myself on being able to keep up with whatever is thrown my way! For this place, customer service is something they do not value whatsoever! My boyfriend and I came in around 9 pm on a Wednesday night (they are 24 hours so it's not like we came in right before close as an inconvenience to them) I have given them multiple chances to impress me, and they fail every time. They will pass you with empty glasses 5+ times. My boyfriend had to ask after the server brought the check, if he could get dessert. I was planning on getting dessert but she brought the check AGAIN!!"}

{"text":"Not sure how they are with dine in, but we have ordered from them four times now with take out and four straight times they have messed up our order.   The last time they messed up our order they were at least nice about it, and gave us free grandslam coupons.   But this time was way too far. They had all of our food in the same boxes (all the pancakes from the grand slams together, etc)   We called to complain, and the guy (his name was Joe) who called hung up on us five times without giving the phone to a manager like we requested.   We love Denny's, but we won't go to this one again. We called the Denny's from Cranberry to see what to do, and they are going to get the info for their District Manager. The GM from Cranberry Denny's (Brian) was very nice, and even he said you never hang up on a customer.   If we go to Denny's again we'll be driving the extra distance to go to Cranberry."}
{"text":"It was my mom's birthday and we were in the area, I remembered checking Yelp reviews and found that it offered free bday brunch so we went in and ordered. The waiter didn't ask for ID from my Mom and I ordered a light lunch. The free meal was the Original Grand Slam and it's definitely very filling on its own with 2 pancakes, 2 fried eggs and 2 sausages."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Denny's for 3-4 years now.  My spouse and I have breakfast with our very close friend on Sunday's often.  Our daughter and I go there sometimes on Friday's before school as well as special treat.  Very friendly staff, I cannot remember ever having bad service.  A lot of the servers have been there for the whole time we have been going there.  A lot of them know us.  Very nice people.  It is still Denny's so of course it's not 5 star dining but the service is great!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience..... we walked in it took them over 10 minutes to bring our black cups of coffee .....my cup came with lipstick all over it  and after another 10 minutes we finally just left because nobody would come give us any service..."}
{"text":"What the hell is wrong with Denny's in Las Vegas!? They ALL SUCK! This is the fifth Denny's we've been too! This time waited in line for over 5 minutes before greeted as there was only one person in the front. Then we got skipped over for others who came in after us! Took hella lo g just to get water and drinks! The service here is horrible. Wow."}
{"text":"Sometimes you don't want to drive 30 minutes to discover that yet unknown but uber cool restaurant in your area.  Sometimes you just want to drive 1 minute from your hotel and eat a plate of pancakes.  Denny's is Denny's, whether you're in Michigan or Ohio or California.  I like that when I want their pancakes or their Moons Over My Hammy sandwich...and I'm in MI or OH or CA.  Is it fancy schmancy?  No.  Do they have gourmet French Toast?  Nope.  Consistently decent breakfast foods in a brightly lit, loud diner?  Yep."}
{"text":"My waiter was awesome, engaging, and super friendly and prompt. The reason I'm giving it one star is that I took my nephews here today and one of them ended up getting a raw burger. He didn't even realize it until he bit into it and I saw pink. It's just horrible considering the fact that he can get sick. I had to ask for a new one. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Came here with my Daughter for an evening snack. We were Greeted as we walked in and seated right away.  I think our Waitress was named Brittany.  She was very friendly and always smiling.  She was very attentive even though she looked like she was by herself and busy.  Over all the food was good.  Took about 15 min for our food.  This is by far our best experience at a Denny in this area. Good job Brittany and others we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"this is our everyday breakfast spot while we were in vegas. just a few steps from our hotel, 24 hours, good price, fast service.  i love, looooved the skillets. a perfect mix of carbs and veggies. always packed, always delicious, 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I always have a good experience at this location. The staff, the food (breakfast and lunch items), the wait time are all positive."}
{"text":"I love Dennys pancakes and eggs, but not here! I usually go to Carefree Highway and the I 17, but we were in the neighborhood and stopped here for a bite. Pancakes were really tiny  and I asked for another one. Manager was argumentative and unpleasant, saying these were especially BIG, and walked away. I wasn't even given the chance to order another pancake. Her arrogance cost them a customer and a bad review. Really bad customer service. I will not be going back to Dennys on Bell, near the I 17."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Dennys breakfast ! I usually get the Chicken fried steak and eggs ! So good ! The Gramslamwich is an also must try ! The maple bread is awesome!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty small compared to the Denny's back home. But the waiters were pretty nice, funny, but of course they were just all up in our business cause us ratchet b/tches are just too damn cool ;) hahaha! The food is on point. I'm not a big fan of Denny's, but I must say, my country fried steak was bomb."}
{"text":"A special thanks to Brandy!  We visited Dennys at the new years eve and Brandy was all the time smiling. I'm German, so I had many questions and she explained everything and was soo cute and nice.  The hole restaurant was so busy and she was so calm.   I have to say, she was one of the best waitress, I ever had.   Happy new year"}
{"text":"I love Denny's but would not recommend this location. Spoon dirty. They forgot the bacon on my super bird and when I told them, my samy was already half gone. No discount.  Small portion of fries.  Ghetto employees and clientele.  Same high prices as the good Denny's I go to in oc California."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for dinner and was very unpleased. After waiting a long time for our food the waitress comes out with my fianc√©'s food and said the cook got \"distracted\" and forgot mine. By the time I reviewed my food, my fianc√© was done eating. When I got my French fries there was a paper in them. The waitress just gave lame excuses and what I felt to be a very fake apology. The toast my fianc√© had ordered with her skillet never came out, when they finally did bring it it was cold and old. You could tell it had been sitting in the window for a while. The mozzarella sticks were undercooked and mushy. This is probably the last time we will come here. We've kept trying to give this location more chances but it seems to just be getting worse."}
{"text":"Worst place, took me about one hour and 30 minutes to get sited . There it's enough staff to accommodate . My suggestion take this pice of crap down and build and IHOP"}
{"text":"Watch out for homeless people at this restaurant!  I really like Denny's - excellent service & food - and I wanted to try out this location.  But I was approached by a belligerent homeless woman in the parking lot who is living (shelter and all) behind the restaurant along the walking / bicycle trail.  She and her friends are literally living there.  Since these people have moved in, I don't want to deal with this every time I want a meal out.  I wish they'd clear them out!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever food was cold my wife food didn't come out complete didn't offer to change they didn't even give us a notice or a discount nephew food was cold like it was siting there waiting on the rest food this place is a joke! And to top it off I let the manager know and he didn't care!we saw our waiter one time I had to go up and ask for my bill...f@&k this place #joke"}
{"text":"Man I love this place everybody makes me and my wife fell welcome every time we come in form Blanca,cece,Chris and manny more"}
{"text":"Marginal experience. Food was not very good. Wait time to order was slow - appears they are understaffed as the front door man was also seating people, getting items from the back room, taking orders, bussing tables, & checking on customers. Steak was undercooked, biscuits were bland, etc. Overall, I'm not surprised because it is Denny's but I'm still a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this is so low rated because it was always super packed. Maybe it's not amazing, but it's popular, so I'm sure Denny's is satisfied with that.  I'm sure if you've been to any Denny's you know what to expect for the food. In this popular Strip area, there aren't a lot of breakfast options, and this has more well rounded options than going to McDonald's or Starbucks or some more expensive restaurant.   I came here 3 times for breakfast during my trip, and there was always a wait and not a big wait area. The service was a little unreliable, but it was packed, so of course that's going to be expected. I never had a problem getting a coffee refill as it seemed one person walked around to all the tables to refill those.  It's not a quiet, relaxing atmosphere, but you can get some low calorie breakfast options. I only had to wait about 10 minutes for a party of 2, but if you have a large party, I'm sure it'll be a lot longer. They also serve alcohol. Honestly, you have to spend so much money on food to eat on the Strip, so I was glad to get a hearty breakfast and okay service. More money to lose in the casinos!"}
{"text":"Gross. We had kids with us so they put us in a separate room. They were understaffed so it took forever to get our food. It's Denny's, not a place I would eat, I blame my brother in law lol."}
{"text":"We come here a bit.  The service is usually good. Different choices then the one at the wild wild west location.."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Once with a drinking buddy after a night out and for a couple of birthdays.  Generally very nice staff, comfortable, reasonable speed and very yummy as I expect from Dennys."}
{"text":"Service is fantastic usually during day time hours. I went at night time somewhere after 12pm and as soon as we walked in the attitude in the server was super rude. It was not busy in there at all so her excuse of not coming to ask our drink orders was not a good one. It took her 20 minutes before one of the people in my party went and asked how long it would take for her to come ask our drink orders. She gave attitude once again and so we waited five more minutes and then walked out. She apparently does have a name because when we asked she just write down MJ."}
{"text":"Servers are extremely nice. Food came out fast and perfect. Very clean. Right off the 17. Great location. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I patronage this restaurant on July 30th of this year 2017. Upon waiting we were quick to be seated because there were only two of us I was celebrating my sister's birthday. We we're seated very quickly within about 10 minutes upon arrival. We were looking over our menus trying to decide what to eat, and much m the situation of insects in his restaurant and asked him if he would be kind enough to comp my meal since my sister's mail was free because it was her birthday. His answer was a flat-out \"NO\". I thought this was the only fair since he did have roaches residing in his restaurant. His comment to me was besides no, I'm sorry for the inconvenience and I will be calling my exterminator. I should have got up and walked out then but I didn't want to spoil My Sister's Day. When our food arrived, they got our order wrong we sent it back and it still came back wrong. The food was not hot the pancakes were cold and it was very disgusting upon seeing a roach I lost my appetite. Upon checking out and paying your tab, my grand slam alone and a drink with my senior discount what's $14.74, almost $15 I thought this was a little high myself for just me personally. To sum it up I'm telling you please please don't eat there at this particular Denny's at 35th Avenue and Bethany Home Road in Phoenix Arizona. If you do you're eating at your own risk and no telling what would you find crawling on the wall or maybe on your feet. ijs...... They're plenty of the restaurants to eat at that are better equipped and the service was the pits as well!! All in all out of 5 stars I give this particular Denny's a minus 10..."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst resturants in Champaign, the service is bad, the food is microwaved and tasteless."}
{"text":"\"Grab a seat where ever it's clean... If there's any!\" Was the lovely greeting I received as I walk in ... So I proceed to grab a seat... I'm sorry but this is already a terrible experience at this all time famous favorite breakfast restaurant... I think it's time to revise customer service skills from their employees if u ask me! I just want some steak and eggs for my post workout not to be treated like some inconvenience to your business... There's too many incredible people out there with no jobs to have this quality of employees running your business! Ugh it's so annoying to see!"}
{"text":"We don't come here often.  The food is pretty basic.  We came today because of a coupon.  We ordered the spicy skillet and a chicken-fried steak (dinner version).  The skillet was surprisingly tasty, and the chicken-fried steak was their usual chicken-fried steak.  The whole grain rice was nothing special (the server said it would be similar to pilaf, but it wasn't).  Overall, for the price paid, it was a reasonable meal.  I can't stand their \"grand slam\" breakfasts, but their skillets can be tasty, their burgers are fine, and the chicken-fried steak is pretty good.  You generally know what you are going to get here.  Service was really good, too.  Today's server was young, enthusiastic, and attentive."}
{"text":"Well, mama had a birthday.  She wanted to get her birthday \"Slam\", so here we are.  I will rate my food (since I didn't try hers, but I am on record previously not liking the \"Slam\").  I got a simple burger.  It was one of their \"specialty\" burgers, but still a burger.  And fries.  Nothing too adventurous.  The food took a while to come out.  It was sufficiently hot, so I'll assume the made it after we ordered.  Which is good!  The fries were fine.  Nothing special, but fine.  The burger was OK.  Honestly I didn't really taste the difference between this and a normal burger.  And for some reason it was determined to fall apart on me every time I picked it up.  My wife ordered a bowl of soup which wasn't as big as she expected, nor as flavorful.  I'm not rating this, just passing on the feedback.  Then when we wanted to purchase gift cards because they had a special bonus going (and we could use them to pay for this meal...not the bonus cards, just the gift cards) they didn't have any.  That's right!  They advertised this bonus gift card special and then they had NO GIFT CARDS.  That's just sad.  Service was friendly, but often MIA (missing in action).  All in all, mediocre.  I'd say don't bother unless you want a Slam on your birthday, or you're desperate."}
{"text":"Denny's knows how guest service is a vital factor for a successful business.  Add some tasty food and you got the perfect combo."}
{"text":"Ehh I'll be nice with a 3 the waitress took off too fast every time no refills she didn't want to be here obviously. But I get it. The steak wasn't that great either I'm still thirsty as we speak."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Denny's.  I grew up at the time when Denny's was only in the US and we would visit them during our hockey road trips.  Of course now Denny's are everywhere.  I haven't been to Denny's for a while and decided to go the other day.  There's something about the Denny's atmosphere that's very comfortable.  For me, as soon as I walk in it's like I just stepped into the US.  Somehow they manage to retain the American feel, right down to the friendly managers and servers.  I always get the Lumberjack Slam and all the coffee I can handle!  I will say that other local breakfast places offer more food for the money compared to Denny's these days, but none have that great atmosphere that only Denny's can provide."}
{"text":"Came here since I woke up late and couldn't secure me a spot at Bob Evans my fave. Do there was a wait I sat at counter. I knew what I wanted,but no longer a menu item,but should still be able to get it. Anyway ordered 2 lumber Jack slams  1 take away.  Eggs were adequate, all the meat was Luke warm. Signs of being pre cooked and held for service. Bacon cold and limp, sausage link cold and shriveled, ham thrown on grill and heated.   Service at this restaurant is slow. NO TEAM WORK, and what brain child runs a Denny's on a Sunday with ONLY 1 manager no team leaders. Will not come back. I suggest, if you are at this restaurant, you look around if guests look agitated or irritated you probably want to rethink your dining options..  All the front of house. NOT A SMILE ANYWHERE. Sylvia was great.  Tinesia was fabulous.   I see many issues in this restaurant that need addressed. Starting with management."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite breakfast places usually good service and good food would recommend it to anyone that likes good pancakes and breakfast"}
{"text":"You can see this location as your coming off the 215. This is one of the nicest Denny's I have ever had the pleasure of sitting in. The scenery is bright and cheery during the day with lots of sunlight pouring in, just what you need in the morning!  The wait staff is friendly and we really enjoyed our french toasts (my cheat day).  I went with the Sticky Bun French Toast, it's a great deal. Why not try this place out you might like it. I think this Denny's is a better than the iHop up the road on Fort Apache.   What an amazing breakfast, for a better price, taste & value."}
{"text":"Breakfast with Ari for dinner.  He's the coolest waiter, so if you appreciate him running around to keep this place going after dark. You should top him fairly 16% (double the tax on the bill).  Amazing coffee, food and service here as always."}
{"text":"To start this is NOT the Denny's in Days Inn! Stop getting it confused.   I've been here twice beforeover a year ago.  The service was slow & crappy both times.  Today we're trying it once more with our server Levi who is pretty quick. It's 12:28 and we places or order about 5 minutes ago.  I went with the Chicken Chorizo Skillet Cheddar cheese only (instead of the blend it came with). My Boyfriend built his own skillet. The service seems to have changed since the help is being attentive this afternoon! Also the staff is busy & they are working with eachother instead of against eachother.  Plus the coffee tastes fresh the aroma of coffee is tickling my nose. Puts anyone in a good mood.  The food is eh.  My skillet came without seasoning on the red skinned potatoes.. super plain.  I sent it back because I think the seasoned potatoe makes the dish along with the Chorizo.  My meal came out exactly the same,  no seasoning again.  So I just ate it plain.    Levi is super attentive. Service 5/5 (from him)  but the food was okay 3/5."}
{"text":"I wish I can give zero stars. I just left and if you want bad service then this is the place for you. I'm done giving this location more and more opportunity's to disappoint."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  NW Calgary needs a good breakfast spot, this isn't it.  A buddy and I stopped in for a quick breakfast.  The place wasn't too busy and we were seated quickly.  My friend is Celiac and asked to order outside the regular preset  \"Slam\" breakfast menu. He was just told no, he can't do that.  No willingness to help out, no compassion to accommodate even the simplest variation. Frustrated we still ordered coffee and two fruit salads as we were starving. After asking our server if he had forgotten our order (50 mins had passed) he never returned to our table.  Totally frustrated we walked out, watched by our waiter and his manager.  They said nothing to stop us. nothing. Needless to say, I'm never going back."}
{"text":"This location is my location of choice in the area. It's clean and the service and food is usually pretty good. 9/10 times I go here I get the Santa Fe skillet or whatever variation of that they have at the time. I actually crave this quite often! This dish is kind of heavy/greasy but it's tasty!"}
{"text":"If i can give this place a zero I would. The service was terrible. Our waiter got all of our orders wrong and charged us for something we didn't order. The portions are small and the food was not cooked right. Scramble eggs were undercooked. I would never fo back to this place."}
{"text":"Okay...so, 11:30 on a Saturday morning MIGHT not have been the best time to come for breakfast. There were throngs of people in the dining room...yet we managed to walk right in and sit down.  Now, understandably, the service was SLIGHTLY delayed due to the sheer volume of people. But our waitress, Sandy, was consistent and pleasant. Even with all of the hustle and bustle, Sandy was able to keep all three of our drinks full.  Denny's has started to emphasize their \"fit and healthy\" menu. Now they shout out items that are high in protien, low in calories, low in fat, and high in fiber. My wife got the \"Fit Slam\", and I opted for the \"Fit Omelet\". Nutritious AND delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered online and went to go pick up my food. They said it would be ready by 11:08am. I got there about 3 minutes early when I checked in I was told that they never put in the order, so I was told they put it in then and that it will be ready shortly. Here I am at 11:35, still no food and I was told it will be another 5 minutes and I finally got my food at 11:45am. This is quite upsetting. From now on I think if I want Denny's I'll be going to a different location. I would have left expect for the fav I had already paid for it. At least the food was warm I guess. About the only thing positive about today's experience there."}
{"text":"Denny's as a whole is classic. But it begs the question... Is it TOO classic? Is it just me or does anyone else feel a presence when they're here? -WM"}
{"text":"A long time ago I remember Denny's in Hawaii being a place to go for breakfast and the food was great along with the service but now days honestly I'm not so sure. The server though was great, she checked on us a lot and made sure we all were comfortable and our drinks were filled. The real major problem was the time it took for the food to come out which was painfully long and then the food itself was not what I was expecting. A lot of salt in most of the food we ate. I think the mixture of us waiting for so long didn't help either.. I'm probably going to still stop at other Denny's just because of the good childhood memories."}
{"text":"I live in a city that doesn't have a Denny's, I know very sad :( When I realized that our hotel wasn't too far from this location we decided to come here for breakfast. We got very lucky and it wasn't super crowded yet and got a table right away. Our waiter was super nice and honest about their food which I always appreciate. I decided to go with build my own grand slam. You picked four items for less than $9 and they aren't cheap with the food. I personally don't like pancakes but after a few days of drinking in Vegas I wanted and needed the carbs so I got some pancakes, turkey bacon, eggs and hash browns. Everything was delicious and the portion was more than I can eat."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at Dennys in years.  We were staying at the Tahiti Resort next door and this was an obvious choice for breakfast with the kids without having to drive. So on our one week stay we ate here 3 times.  Twice for breakfast and once for dinner.  The first 2 times it was super busy for breakfast, but we were still seated in a timely manner.  Our kids loved their pancakes and I especially liked the $2,4,6,8 menu. It was a very affordable choice menu to order from.  The pancakes were yummy, and for $4 you get 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 sausage or bacon.  Which is a steal! Twice my husband ordered an entree one salmon the other tilapia. And both those dishes were just ok. I also ordered the nachos and that was a super large serving.  Probably could use a bit more meat though.  And each time we ordered the $2 cheese quesadilla for our toddler which was perfect for her. Nothing special just melted cheese on a plain tortilla.  Overall it was a quick simple choice to come here and eat.  Our server on our second visit was great.  The other times it was ok.  But the manager was nice both times in the morning walking around checking on the tables.  I probably won't come here for dinner but for breakfast it's a definite yes."}
{"text":"I was greeted immediately. Seated immediately. And when I sat down I let our waiter know that I needed a whole lot of water. Instead of getting that, I got to watch the young lady, that quickly greeted and sat us, and our waiter flirt for over an hour. My glass was refilled twice, I've asked about 7 times now. Food was great. But I would only come here if I was blacked out and it was the only place open.."}
{"text":"Food was ok. but the whole place was filthy. Food everywhere when talked to manager the person behind us told the manager how she dirty her table was when she was seated also when she left still was not cleaned. I'm not sure but I at least expect a place to be decent.  This was not at all"}
{"text":"Oh man, this is my first time to Denny's.  Ordered -  Veggie Skillet : tasted so amazing. Especially the paprika topped potato wedges blew my mind. I even ordered a small portion of potato wedges as an appetizer.  Don't believe me, look at the picture I posted. Way better than ihop for sure and it's open 24*7.  Service was incredibly fast and waitress was good enough to check on us if we needed anything.  This place earns a 5 * if I had few more options in appetizer menu and skillets."}
{"text":"My Husband and I were at this location on 12/24/2013. We have gone to this Denny's every year on 12/24 for the past 3 years. We met each other online and chose this location to meet  for the first time. 4 months later we we married, and every year we meet at this Denny's on the Date we met. Our same booth is always open LOL.... This last year we just happened to get the same waitress that we had the prior year and she remembered us. I wish I could remember here name she was cute and pregnant, I think she was due any day. She was excellent. food was excellent. Everything was clean even restrooms. I have been going to this Denny's off and on for the last 35 years.  and they do get 5 stars from me.. Thank you Denny's"}
{"text":"Denny's getting a 5/5? Let me paint this picture for you.  Mother's day. Place is rammed. 1.5 hour wait estimated by mom has never been so we waited. What do they do for the patient people waiting to be seated? Free juice. Yeah. Free. At the door. Nobody asked. Amazing.  So we sit and Roxann is just one of the best servers we've ever had in a diner. Ever! Faster and more considerate than I thought would be possible considering the crowd.  The food? Awesome. Guilty, but awesome. Right on time as well. The prime rib in the omlette was tender and the jalapenos were punchy. My only concern was that the bacon was really thin, though cooked perfectly. I'd love to see thicker rashers, even if they were more expensive. The toasts were good and the pancakes were fluffy.  Definitely making this Denny's a place I go to."}
{"text":"I've personally never been a Denny's fan but I have to say that has changed. The place was clean and super busy on a Saturday morning. We were sat right away and ordered pretty quickly. We waited 45minutes for our food before we complained....the manager came over and explained their system crashed and was the reason for the wait. She handled the situation like a BOSS and comped the entire bill. The food came almost immediately and was actually really good!? Hash browns were incredible, pancake nice and fluffy and eggs....they were eggs lol. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of those drunk nights to early morning breakfast kickers. My friend and I ordered the most greasiest of greasiest options to fill our drunken bellies up to happiness after waiting forever in our waiter to order. They took forever to help us and the place wasn't even busy. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Don't go late at night.  One cook/manager and one server. It took 22 minutes to take our order. And the 42 minutes to get served breakfast. They were not busy the manager and server couldn't get off their cell phone and work. Great place in the morning but I won't go back after dark."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Great breakfast.  Kimberly the hostess greeted us with a smile and was awesome. Our server on the other hand was not so good. She was slow and never saw her after the food was delivered. Alejandr was busy talking and texting instead of getting our food. Drinks were never refilled and after waiting for a long time I finally went to the register and got my check. Great food. Bad service."}
{"text":"Came to this dennys one morning and had to wait a while to be seated because they were short staffed. That being said we had to wait a while for our meal. The chicken in my girlfriends salad was rubbery and seemed undercooked. The burger I had was decent though."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a while, and I was pleasantly surprised by the decor update. Wood floors, stone facing,clean look. They even fixed up the bathrooms, which were really lacking. We were seated quickly and brought our coffee and water, but had no silverware. When our server came by to take our order, we asked for some and she said she'd get on it. We watched her walk right behind the counter and start talking with her coworkers and joking loudly. After about five minutes, we decided to steal the silverware off another table. After our food came, she disappeared behind the front counter again and proceeded to talk for another fifteen minutes or so. Our ketchup was empty, so we had to steal that from another table as well. We only got one refill on our coffees, and we were there an hour. I'd expect not to see waitstaff if it was really busy, but there were maybe five tables occupied in the restaurant.  Additionally, our plates felt rather bare. My boyfriend ordered the Sriracha chicken sandwich with fries - there were maybe a handful of fries and the sandwich felt light for $10. The ham and cheese omelet had hardly any cheese in it and my hasbrowns were half burned. I would have complained, but our waitress was entirely uninterested in us being there. I understand that waiting tables can suck hard, but to be honest, if you're going to slack off, do it where I can't see you.  It's nice that they modernized the place, but they might consider upping their standards elsewhere."}
{"text":"My food was pretty good, got a 4 berry fizz and really enjoyed it! My Boyfriend didn't enjoy his meal as much. He wasn't impressed with the sausage or Ham in his lumberjack meal.   Service was great, friendly and talkative."}
{"text":"Seated quickly, service was prompt n polite, we always eat breakfast here, and it never disappoints"}
{"text":"Remodel looks great. Food was really good and service was excellent. Hadn't been here for a long time because I wasn't a huge fan before but I'll definitely be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Dennys @ 1826 las vegas blvd S in las vegas nevada has really good food the staff take excellent care of their customers I highly recommend this dennys to all who read this post on yelp"}
{"text":"I was looking through all the reviews and I had low expectations. I live in California and I have been to other Denny's a few times. I came in and was seated almost immediately. Our waitress, Tana, was very nice and was always helping and checking on us with perfect timing. We ordered and got our food in about 5-10 minutes. I got the grilled chicken wrap with ranch and I subbed mashed potatoes for the fries. The food was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. They were not very busy, so you could hear the quiet music and enjoy a nice, quiet meal. Overall, the food and service was amazing, if I could give 10 stars, I would!"}
{"text":"After arriving in Vegas I was driving by and I had seen this hotel casino with a Dennys on Orbitz. Stopped in for breakfast. The food was decent but the waiter never refilled my coffee would have liked to have one more cup"}
{"text":"I tried to place a togo order at this location. I say \"tried\" because despite repeated calls over a two hour period tonight, no one actually answered the phone so I could place the order. Luckily for me the guys at Village Inn answer the phone."}
{"text":"Its just like any other Denny's. But I'm in Vegas. There's a bunch of other places I could have eaten after the club, but Denny's always seems to be the answer. I had a burger and seasoned fries. Then I had the runs the next morning. Thats all I remember. Well done Vegas, well done."}
{"text":"We were having a great time in Vegas celebrating our 25 anniversary until we came here. We came for breakfast and when we got our drinks we noticed our glass were dirty. We asked for new glass and the ones they brought us were also dirty. When we got our food, which did not take long it was horrible. Eggs were way over cooked, bacon tasted old and like jalape√±o, and pancakes were cold. I like Denny's  but I won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Definitely not the cleanest Denny's I've ever eaten at.  Rather than being greeted when I walk in like I experience at most Denny's I was pretty much ignored for 5 minutes.  We were finally shown to a table and ignored again for awhile.   Ignored again for awhile until they remembered to ask us if we'd like something to drink.  Are you getting the picture? Very slow service here?   The food and service was very below average for Denny's ."}
{"text":"I upgraded my review from 2 star to 4.  The customer service improved drastically.  Congrats."}
{"text":"Excellent servers is the the only reason I give 2 stars. Management is beyond horrible. The kitchen staff cooks like boy scouts and they are always out of at least one thing when any customer orders. The food is less than impressive. Two thumbs down, my bff and I will never go back."}
{"text":"when you go to Vegas, you quickly realize that this town's prices follow a \"well curve\" (sorry kids, we're talking Statistics out here) - everything's pretty much really cheap or really costly.  Denny's falls on the lower end of that price spectrum. the $2-4-6-8 Menu is a blessing handed down from God/Allah/Yahweh/Odin/Zeus/Joe Pesci.  for $6 I got the southern omelet: 3 eggs, cheese, crumbled biscuit, sausage, gravy, cheese, hash browns and toast. also got some coffee and orange juice. total was around $10. the sausage was kind of bland, but the rest of the flavors acted in deliciously unhealthy unison. what obesity epidemic?  service? could have been better. but the place was packed, and yet our group of 6 was seated in 10 minutes, so I give them props for that.  furthermore, you got 24-hour service and 99 cent bottles of water.  and in case you're wondering, I only ate two meals a day in Vegas and walked around a lot to counteract the food/booze overconsumption."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner recently as we stayed a night at the hotel next door. We each had a soup and shared a chicken skillet. Everything was really good surprisingly. Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant, the hostess told us there would be a 40 minute wait for our food.  The place was half full (with some very perturbed customers) and no less than 10 people working the shift.  We turned around and went right back out.  Went to Burger King."}
{"text":"I did not experience terrible customer service today nor was the food bad. However, we were seated at a table that was not cleaned properly. There was a used  dirty crumpled up napkin leftover on our table which is gross. My silverware was also spotty....so I have to wonder if things are clean here."}
{"text":"I have been to many Denny's and this location particularly has poor customer service and long wait time for your orders. Not sure what happen to them... probably will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"I do enjoy the food at Denny's.  Of course it is not the gourmet food you get at the high end restaurants!  That being said I always enjoy a bowl of their chicken noodle soup and whatever sand which catches my eye.  I like Denny's for late night meals as it is good food fast.      Tonight I had the Pot Roast sandwich on grilled sourdough.  It had plenty of cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms.  The pot roast was plentiful and moist and tasty.  It came with seasoned fries which were crispy and delicious.  Since I started off with the delicious chicken noodle soup I was only able to eat half of the sandwich and fries.      The dining area was clean and the service was outstanding.  Our Waitress was fun and had a great sense of humor.  I am already craving the chicken noodle soup and will be back soon to fill the craving!"}
{"text":"We ordered two cups of coffee, \"Fit Slam\", and \"Honey Jalape√±o Bacon Slam\".  What I find very unfortunate when it comes to these brunch/breakfast places is that they often overlook the importance of good coffee. Sadly, Denny's wasn't an exception. It was over $2 for each cup of hot black water.  Food was not bad but not exceptionally good either. Fit Slam's scrambled egg was really soft but a bit bland, but I guess that's what comes with healthy-labeled food. Pancake that came with Honey Jalape√±o Bacon Slam was really fluffy and nice! Jalape√±o Bacon was also interesting in a very positive way.  Staffs were nice and I'd say service was great, considering how they were also open on boxing day!"}
{"text":"I love Dennys and this one has an amazing vegetarian burger!! Most Denny use a boca burger this one uses Amys. It has a very cool set up, old style 1960s feel."}
{"text":"Ok the service was not the best, prices r a lil high but they had the best fries ever!!  I had the veggies burger and the sundae with baby pancakes.  For 2$ u would never get a dessert like that.  Over all i would go there again when i want to treat myself  Good place"}
{"text":"Hate doing this however I'm currently on hold and now 30mins have gone by. Order received is grossly incomplete. Have been put on hold for a manager right now time on hold is 36:48mins waiting.   Missing fruit, syrup for all entrees, a milkshake and a breakfast sandwich and hash browns.   I don't blame the gal, I think she meant well and didn't have the capacity to say anything else but sorry.  I'm still on hold"}
{"text":"I gave this Denny's a 5 stars because of the consistently excellent service we received from this joint.  Denny's food have always been consistent for us everywhere we have been,  At Denny;s, we can always count on getting a decent meal at a reasonable price.  I especially love Denny's pancakes.  I am informing Denny's management to recognize the great services we received from your wonder staff members Zuzzie and Ralph consistently at Denny's, 1201 W. Warm Springs Road, Henderson, NV ."}
{"text":"I came in this evening  not too many people. Was very quiet.  Good atmosphere.  I had the double cheese burger with cheddar cheese on a whole wheat bun with lettuce tomato and red onion. And a bowl of fresh fruit bananas,  red grapes and cantaloupe.  This was very delicious.  I will be returning to this location,  I have found my home away from home."}
{"text":"Checking in for Denny's for my free birthday meal. The food is always good here. The people are friendly. It's a great place stop if you're hungry and ready for a large meal. The food is consistent across Denny's so you know what you're getting each time you go. They also offer some substitutions which makes it a little nicer"}
{"text":"Update: Making this a 3.5 : / I forgot that they up-sell you for cheese on your hash browns, and they also not include bread with your meal, so when they offer and you select something, you get an additional charge. I am all OK for that if they bring it to your attention upfront, but even if it is a small fee I don't think it is cool...   Went here for breakfast Saturday morning after dropping a car for service at one of the dealers nearby. We were promptly seated and our server Jazmin was outstanding! she was very cheerful and seemed to have a great attitude. In the service industry it makes a huge difference when people do their job giving you the feeling that they are happy to be there, and that you are there... that is how we felt.  She was very accommodating and answered all our questions.  Hubby had the Santa Fe skillet, that actually comes in a sizzling skillet! what a concept, haha (our other breakfast places we frequent just serve them in a skillet shaped dish)...  Daughter had some burrito with bacon and avocado and she liked it very much.  I got the veggie omelette (I never go with only veggies) and it was really good. Plenty of veggies, fluffy omelette, very tasty.  Hubby had diet Coke, daughter and I had the pumpkin coffee, which is really good but it was too sweet for me, Jazmin helped out so it would not be as sweet.  Great experience. We are not in this neighborhood very often but we will certainly come back next time we take our car for service : )"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Good service. Good desserts. Always open and clean. It's as good as any other Dennys you went across the country. Shopping is conveniently in the same complex."}
{"text":"This is worst service Denny's ever, food sucked, it was warmer outside an there was a snow storm out..Never again"}
{"text":"We stopped into this location for an early breakfast one morning. The restaurant seemed clean but didn't have many customers. It was us, along about 5 or 6 other tables so I know they weren't too busy to provide basic service!  The service started out fast - the waiter took our order and delivered our drinks in about 5 mins. Of course he never returned to fill our drinks during the entire meal, all while refilling the drinks of the table next to us 3 times!   When he delivered our food, he got half of it correct. Instead of blueberry pancakes, he brought banana pecan ones. He didn't bring any toast and delivered fried eggs instead of scrambled. The worst part was that he never returned to ask how our food was (the food he correctly delivered was pretty good).  The highlight of the meal was that we got to watch the table next to us (with 3 girls) get top notch service!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim was it was one of the restaurants opened late that served a huge variety of finger foods, snacks, desserts, drinks without going over budget. Even getting just the appetizers were filling enough. My most to least favourite:  Nachos (Pepper Jack queso, shredded Cheddar Cheese, Meat, Pico de Gallo, and Sour Cream) ~$11 - more of a warm treat and all the flavours blended nicely together; it didn't have any specific tangy or zesty taste (from tomatoes or lime) to which I do prefer with my nachos.  Chicken Strips (served with Celery & Sweet & Tangy BBQ sauce) - a standard craving fulfilled. Wish there was more though!  Cheese & Sausage Quesadillas (Grilled Chicken Breast, Crumbled Sausage, Fire-Roasted Bell Peppers and Onions, Cheese, Pico de Gallo Tortilla & Ranch Dressing) ~$8 - It's nice if you're into a lot of flavour, but it was extremely heavy and filling.  It's worth it considering the price I'm paying for. A lot of them did have a similar base to it so I felt like I was eating different versions of the same flavours. The staff is friendly and the food is served hot and fresh. I'll definitely come back to try more of the menu :)"}
{"text":"First review in almost 5 months. used to go here alot. I even know the faces of the serves and I know them by name. The thing about this place after not coming here for so many months is that they had a hug renovation. Gone are the old decor and the old tables and chairs. The new style and atmosphere is 10 times better than the old one but to my dismay the food went from 4 star to 2 almost 1 star. Here's the 4 main reason I put it to 2 star.  1. My favorite pot roast was smothered by gravy. it's covered with gravy I can't even see anything in my plate just dark brown gravy.  2. Foods are too salty. This was not an issue before, yes maybe their leaning more in the salty side but not this salty. I could swear to god my bread was as salty as my gravy.  3. So after my dismay I told myself maybe it's just one of those day, u know. But even in the dessert department they got me upset. First ordered a milkshake. Maybe it's just me but it doesn't taste like it used to. It doesn't have that smoothness and it's too chocolatey. Almost like someone just poured a bucket of chocolate powder in a bucket and shared it. Oh and they forgot to ask if I want whipped or not and put whipped on it-_-  4. Okay after that I tasted their used to be pancake. And said of course they can't mess this up. Well, the pancake is so stale and was not smooth at all. You know that feeling of like eating a either cold or old food. That's what I felt when I started eating that pancake.  P.s I will still give it another try."}
{"text":"1 STAR because they replaced my husband's order but it still ddn't make me forget that his omelette has a matchbox w/ it! Eeeeewwwwww!  They quickly took hubby's plate, my only mistake is I ddn't take a photo of it.  I'll stay away from this chain forever!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:50 PM. The place was far from crowded. It took 5 minutes to get our drink order. Another 10 minute to take our order.  Over 45 minutes to get our food. When the food arrived it was not even slightly warm. The manager insisted he would personally \"remake\" my order. He took the plate and came back in about 2 minutes with warm food that suspiciously looked like the old food heated in a microwave. Following that it took the server about 5 minutes more to bring the syrup for the pancakes. She made excuses for the previous plate of cold food. The manager took one of the two orders off the bill, but he made excuses for himself, blaming the server. He assured me he told the cooks she was slow and a bad server. He said he told her off already. The whole experience was horrible. I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"lots of choices .. had tbone and shrimp  .. steak was ok nor seasoned or aged .. shrimp was breaded with too much breading .. dining room was clean and service was scarce after our order was taken"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! The waiter didn't check on us and when she did she saw my drink was empty and didn't even fill it! The food came out cold and dry. Her excuse was that the cook was \"new\". I don't care if he is new. Have some guest service and pride in what u guys are presenting. It isn't cheap to eat there. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I come here multiple times a month.  Janine provides some of the best service.  Going on Sundays is a nightmare, so don't.  Also, the new girl with the purple hair was rude and her lines were uneven.  Overall, one the best places to go for a quick cut and dry.  They even shampoo and offer hot oil scalp treatments."}
{"text":"We love the new look   We like the food overall but hash browns never come we'll cooked and they are really greasy"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing Denny's inside of Fiesta only based on their $1.99 special that is not advertised. Just ask for \"the breakfast special\" and you'll get two eggs, either sausage or bacon and a small stack of two pancakes. To get this special, you will need to order a beverage, but that's the only catch!  Food came out fast. Service wasn't bad. My overeasy eggs were overeasy, and they have Cholula hot sauce. What more can I ask for?  Their breakfast special is available any time of the day at this specific Denny's. Now, be ignorance-ridden and no longer order a side of pancakes for $2 when you can get everything else that comes with a decent and hearty American breakfast!"}
{"text":"I tend to think that just about everybody has some sort of story that has to do with Denny's. Whether they be funny, drunken, high, sad, depressed or what not...Denny's is your go to American restaurant anytime of the day. And yes, that does apply, even with the one in Fremont St. in Downtown Vegas.   Probably one of the few Denny's that has an open bar(duh, its Vegas), this is one of the very few places that will remain open especially after all other places nearby have closed. I came here on a bright Sunday morning with my foodie +1 date after EDC because we was craving breakfast. Denny's was my first choice, not hers. Eventually since nothing else was open, we opted here. Very roomy inside with a very sweet waitress who attended to us...should've gotten her name but due to the fact that I was half asleep, I couldn't do so. I had their fit slam and my +1 had their philly steak omelette. We really did not want to stuff ourselves too much before going to bed!   Just like any other Denny's, this one does not stand out too much, except for the fact that this one just so happens to be in Sin City. I do believe everyone will visit this one at some point during their Vegas debauchery! Flat screen TV's with comfy seats!! Also heard they have a photo booth. Only know due to word of mouth!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on New Years Day so obviously we were hungover and Denny's was busy.  We waited in their overflowing waiting area for about 20 minutes for a table which was rough to put it mildly.  Staff seemed totally overworked and totally over it. Our food arrived fairly quickly but one person's order was totally messed up so he had to wait 15 minutes for his meal to arrive.  Food was very very meh and our waitress never came back to fill up our coffees.  Bill was expensive for the quality of food and overall experience.  Wouldn't return again unless forced against my will lol"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible....we were seated immediately, but from the time we sat until we received our food it took 1 hour! My eggs were cold, pancakes were tough like rubber, and the bacon and sausage links were soggy. The toast and hash browns were the only items cooked correctly. My wife's omelette was filled with unmelted cheese, and her bacon was cold and soggy also. Overall horrible experience. And as I am writing this review, my check has yet to be brought to the table. I definitely won't ever eat at this Denny's again."}
{"text":"This Dennys needs improvement, most of the women employees are very sloppy dressed with bad hygiene. also are very very loud, The restaurant sales floor should be peaceful and organized. It's too bad because we have a corporate office that would order a couple of a week, Plus they never answer a phone, I'm now eat breakfast in Scottsdale and stay away from this ghetto service, I don't know how this Dennys has gotten away with this they need a visit from corporate,"}
{"text":"I am a person who loves Denny's and I definitely enjoyed the food and service. I dined in and then came back the next day for take out. When we dined in the location was in the middle of a menu switch. Things that we saw on the menu and picked was then told that they no longer had them, but our waiter was very helpful with steering us in the right direction of what we had a taste for. The management was also helpful with be understanding when we asked for a markdown on our food because key items were missing because they didn't no longer had them in stock. When we came back the second night we walked in for take out. Staff again was very friendly and the take out was quick and still delicious once I reached my hotel suite."}
{"text":"I will never give Denny's 5 stars after I experienced one of the worst times of my restaurant life! My man and I came in, were seated, given menus, then completely ignored! Yes ignored. They were even snickering. It wasn't even that packed. I think they need to go back to the drawing board."}

{"text":"We went in on a Sunday morning, 15 mins wait in line & 45 mins for food arrived . Understanding it was rush hr BUT I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED when the food came out look like it been over a night . I'm shock how it doesn't look like the picture out the menu . Sad! We won't be back anymore."}
{"text":"Me & my friend alway come to this location, it so close to everything near by my place, alway get a very nice server & treat us kindly of whatever we ask & needed. Depend on hours that we have to wait for a little bit but usually food come out about just time. No need to question, our orders alway come in best look & taste perfectly . We love to go Denny for brunch & dinner ."}
{"text":"I ate at this Denny's this past Friday and had a horrible experience. To begin, the restaurant was packed and the wait time was 20 min. At first I thought they were just busy. Once we were seated though I noticed an abundance of open tables. (in fact we were almost alone in our section)  Once we were seated we waited about 10 minutes before the waitress arrived to take our drink order. We had already made our food selection and ordered this as well. As we sat waiting we noticed no one had food only drinks. We waited for a good 45 min before we received our food. Only not all of us received it. My 4 y/o daughter's food did not come out. My order also came out incorrectly prepared.   The waitress finally brought out my daughter's food which was also incorrect. We sent it back. At thus time we noticed other customers doing the same with their food. I can only imagine it was a new cook that was training.   Finally the manager came over and apologized. At least he took ownership. He asked if I needed anything else and I asked for a refill of my soda. I was still waiting 10 minutes later so we left.  I will not visit this Denny's again."}
{"text":"I always seem to end up at this Denny's.  It was Comic Expo weekend so it was a 45 minute wait just to get into any brunch establishment.  I am not a huge fan of franchised restaurants, unfortunately this one was not my choice.   There was NO parking available and where this restaurant is situated, there is no street parking available either.    That being said - it was 45 minutes to be seated at our table, it took forever to get our drinks.  Two of the meals were messed up and one was returned untouched.  The food was \"meh\" at best.    The only reason I am giving the three stars was because of our server.  She went out of her way to try and correct the kitchen's mistakes and spoke to the manager to have the bill discounted because of all the hassles.    We came, we ate, we left."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and staff is very nice. The problem is is that unfortunate there's a lot of transients around this place and it causes blight around the restaurant and attached Frys Shopping Center. I must have been getting concerned a few times when I've been going in and out of there after sunset. I know Dennis has tried working with Fry's personal security but so far no result"}
{"text":"4 stars for a Dennys? Yes. I'll explain. The place was quiet, clean, the food was good standard american. The waitress Janna and the other guy were great but the best part was the awesome music they played. Golden/bubble gum oldies  great relaxed atmosphere. I needed a little old school traditional meal today and got it. Hope next time is the same!"}
{"text":"Great service, super cool inside,  just please turn off the constant CNN feed on all the TVs. Had to take a star off for that!"}
{"text":"Did the quality go after 3 years?  The last time I went to that location was 2011...I was a chaperone for a church youth group. I didn't know what I had, but it was edible, I went there more than 20 years ago (same Denny's) and it was okay.  Another franchise that I'd like to put in my film \"Summer I'll Never Forget\"."}
{"text":"Food is nothing like the pictures, but still tasty. 2 stars because of the terrible service. The waitress forgot items repeatedly, didn't offer anything - we had to request everything (napkins, refills, name it & we had to ask), and at the end of it, she didn't give back the bills with the change (again had to request it), she actually left 2/6 bills on another table and left, meaning we got to walk over and pick them up.. we said our 'please' and 'thank-you's' so the service was uncalled for."}
{"text":"always consistent cold and/or lukewarm food, but excellent servers and staff.   Drab bland Luke-warm food Good people.  Nicest waiters....And good mgmt."}
{"text":"Came to eat and there was only THREE tables with people in the whole place. My husband ordered a burger an fries, my children ordered the half order of nachos and the other the lumber jack slam, and I ordered simple hash browns and bacon. We waited 25 minutes for food and even then we waited another 5 for the toast.   Then to boot this is a family atmosphere yet blaring out of the kitchen was Eminem complete with cuss words.   Waitress never even came to check on drinks till after our meals were complete.  Worst experience I have had I must say o won't be returning to this Denny's or another anytime soon."}
{"text":"As much as I hate to admit it I love country fried steak and there's may not be the best in the world but it tastes pretty darn good today, especially with the skillet! I also tried their Baja Burger Keith city the only thing I would say is asked them not to over cook the burger itself, the chipotle flavor meshes wonderfully with the salsa and cheese quesadilla! So Denny's I will be back yet again"}
{"text":"Went in today with my daughter to have dinner around 5pm when we 1st walked in it took the waitstaff about 5 mins to come up to the podium and ask us how many people we had in our party and asked if we would like a table or a booth. Our waitress Savanna Rain was really nice at 1st until I ordered the Everyday Value Slam because I asked for real eggs to be scrambled and she gave me the weirdest look, I had told her that I do no like the taste of egg beaters and I prefer real eggs and then she took my daughters order. When we got our order I had noticed that who ever cooked the so called eggs I got they were not real eggs and they were egg beats cheese and egg omelette. I'm not an omelette person and I wasn't happy, I waited until she returned to the table and explained the situation to her and the only thing she could say was \"interesting\" and walked away. I had to wait another 5-7 mins to get another plate of those disgusting egg beaters I didn't even get to enjoy my food because either the waitress didn't write down what I asked for or the cooks don't know their head from their ass I'm assuming fault on both sides. When it came to the time to check out she asked if we wanted to have separate bills and asked if I wanted a box for the disgusting eggs she served me I declined I'd rather not make the conflict more conflicting than it already was, to make thing go even worse was when I went to pay and the manager asked why I left such a low tip 1st of all it's none of you're damn business and 2nd of all I got the wrong eggs twice in a row and didn't get to enjoy my meal so your waitress got a shitty tip if that's what your asking...going forward please \"write down your customers order correctly\" do you duties if you want to be a server."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for what should have been a great meal.  We were a party of 7, so we expected to wait a little bit.  We were told 20 mins and based on how many people were waiting, I felt that was very reasonable.  After 40 mins we were finally called, then stopped as the woman said \"larger parties are always asked to wait 10 more minutes before being seated.\"  For some reason we stuck around and still were seated after that.  As we walked in, the biggest surprise happened.  Nearly 75% of the restaurant was EMPTY!!!  There was PLENTY of seating and plenty of staff running around to seat everyone that had been waiting and was currently still waiting.  Once we were seated, the food was good, but the service was mediocre at best.  Will definitely not return to this particular Dennys EVER."}
{"text":"My grandpa and I came here to celebrate my birthday. We initially thought that we could order anything for free. Unfortunately, they were only serving breakfast, so I could not order what I had wanted. The breakfast included 2 pancakes, any drink, 2 eggs, and 4 pieces of bacon/turkey bacon. The Oreo milkshake and the pancakes were both amazing. The service in the restaurant was quite fast and I really liked our server. The pancakes and turkey bacon were both perfectly done. This has definitely been a memorable experience and I would not be surprised if I came back."}
{"text":"Went to Denny's for breakfast while on vacation. Our server was pleasant and got all four orders correct, the food came out quickly and hot. I had created my own grand slam and it was good. No complaints and the others in my party all enjoyed their breakfast as well."}
{"text":"Brenda was awesone! She handled  the rush and made sure everyone was fed! Our waitress  Oliva was great too she rocks. If you sit at the counter you'll get breakfast and a show. Only paid like $25 bucks in Vegas.  Win win."}
{"text":"I prefer to write reviews of places I like, but everything here was so wrong, that I couldn't just ignore it.    My husband and I arrived for breakfast at about 8:45 am. The distracted hostess seated us relatively quickly . . . in a booth that should have been replaced years ago. The dent in the booth was so deep I felt like I was going to hit the floor. Nonetheless, I scooted over to the undented section and looked at the menu.   I decided on the waffle slam as a treat, cuz I love waffles, crisp on the outside and light and fluffy inside. It comes with two eggs, plus bacon and sausage (I swapped out the sausage for more bacon) and a cup of bold coffee.  Then, we waited for someone to stop by. And waited. Eventually, the hostess asked if we had been helped yet and went to tell our server. We waited another five minutes or so and she arrived and took our order.  My husband received his OJ right away, and she brought cream for my coffee.  Ten minutes later, still no coffee. Eventually, I was able to flag down someone else who had my coffee sent out.  Breakfast arrived another five or so minutes later. Cold. Over cooked. With only one egg. The waffle was so crunchy that it arrived in four separate pieces that someone pushed together to try to make it look whole, and the butter never melted on it, because it was lukewarm. The single over easy egg was about room temperature. Eggs with runny yolks really need to be hot to be enjoyable, even if there is only one on the plate (I don't even know how that happened since ALL dishes usually come with two eggs). My husband couldn't even touch his hash browns because they were burnt.   Our server came by ten minutes later to ask about our food, but I couldn't even say anything. All she needed to do was look at the plates before serving to see that it was not serveable. No one even offered a refill on my cup of coffee. We ate what we could (the bacon was immobile, like the kind on a buffet, but edible), and when the bill did not arrive, got up to get it from the front. At that point the overworked server gave it to my husband.   At the front, when asked how everything was I told them it was terrible from service to food, and especially management (poor training, poor scheduling, etc.). They asked us to wait, but I was DONE waiting and left while my husband paid the bill. And, yes, they charged us for a full two-egg breakfast despite only receiving one egg. So, the next Yelper to make the mistake of going here, please make sure they give you my second egg without an extra charge.   Oh, and my husband HATES sitting.  We are usually in and out of places in 30-45 minutes because he gets antsy. We spent so much time waiting that we didn't leave (despite not finishing breakfast) until an hour and a half after we arrived. Sheer agony for him."}
{"text":"During times of low-carbing this is a go to for Skillets as Denny's has a number of them that you can substitute  the hash browns for spinach and not mess up your diet. This location really struggles with its customer service. Seems like everytime I come here there is only a couple waitresses and they're not really on point with getting her order, refilling your coffee or virtually any aspect of the job. When the food does come out usually it is accurate but it's just the terrible customer service you have to deal with if you want to come to this location. Eh, skip this joint."}
{"text":"Cruise the strip...pass by McD's, Jack in the Box, Del Taco, etc...etc... Everyone's hungry...pointing fingers at this place and that place... Until the majority points four fingers at a Dennys...  They coulda dropped me off at those other places n picked me up later They ordered breakfast.... looked tasty... I ordered a double cheeseburger combo for breakfast..   I git these two huge clumps of meat patties inside the bun..   I tossed one patty to the side...   Burger was dry n tasteless and gross. Fries were soft..  I like my fries burnt a crispy I got pieces of burnt hash brown from my friend's plates and a muffin"}
{"text":"We got here around 3 pm. There's only one server for the whole store. We ordered and it took about half an hour or longer to get our food. We ordered a peanut butter banana shake that took about 15 minutes. We also ordered chicken & sausage quesadillas. That took about 5-10 minutes more than the shake. Then about 45 minutes or so in we got our meals. I ordered the Everyday Value Slam. I asked for eggs soft scrambled. The eggs almost looked like just straight flat with a little mixing at the end before it came out of the pan. My pancakes and sausage was good though. Hard to mess that up. Hubby got  a Grand Slam. He said it was alright. He didn't get any refills on his soda until he asked. The server was nice enough, but too busy to really be 5 stars.   If you're not in a rush you can come here if you like. I think they need at least 2 waiters. Not sure if we will come back again. Maybe we'll try another Denny's Restaurant later. I did like the oldies music though."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning and the place was packed! Waited about 15 minutes for a table which wasn't bad at all. To start, the coffee mug I was given was so dirty. Coffee stains all over. Disgusting! Once I pointed it out to the server he immediately changed it so the service was good.   Next, they were out of English muffins. At 11:30 AM. What???   To top it all off, the food was hardly edible because of the amount of butter it was drenched in. The scrambled egg whites were drowning in butter so it defeats the purpose of being a more healthy food choice. The sunny-side up eggs were in the same condition. Bacon tasted old. No crispness whatsoever. The only passable item was the sausage."}
{"text":"Our wait person, Hasel, was the sweetest, most upbeat server!!  Keep smiling Hasel and make your customers as happy as you made us!!!  The nachos were good also!"}
{"text":"Not all Denny's are made the same. This is a good one. Eggs (over easy) were perfect, service was fast and polite. 4 stars because I think the place should have 3.5, not 3."}
{"text":"This is an old time, not updated Denny's, so I really enjoy it.  It is fun to find an old Diner style Denny's with booths that feel and look original.  You can't sit here long as the padding is long gone.  But I don't really care when I go to a Denny's, I expect quick service, food that is consistent, and at a low price.  This place delivers on all of these items."}
{"text":"A late night Christmas Evening Staple.     I was on the road and unfortunately nothing was open.   While driving down the road - I see a beacon of yellow light calling me.   I was attracted like a bug light on a hot summer day.  The place was packed and featuring Hobbit specialties (which I avoided).   I almost caved on the grilled cheese / fried mozzarella sandwich.     I can only say that Denny's is a restaurant where they should server Pabst Blue Ribbon and Little Kings with every meal because of the type of food they serve.      I did order some pie and a cup of coffee.   My server was very nice (I felt bad because she was working on Christmas Day).     Overall - my experience was good.    Food - I had the pie (Coconut Cream - it was okay) Atmosphere - Busy"}
{"text":"I come to this location often since it is en route to where I work.  What I love about this place is the staff here are friendly. even the managers are welcoming, sometimes I'll get hugs!! Talk about feeling like I'm part of the family!  The other reason why I love this place is because, sometimes, I'd rather having a burger for breakfast, or nachos, maybe even an epic salad. It depends on what I'm in the moods for.  I'm not the typical person stuck on traditional meal genres and what foods are to be eaten at those times.  I like to stop in here and get whatever inspires me!  Definitely go visit this location and enjoy the smiling faces that may greet you, they're genuine smiles! #NJoy!  :)  Shout out to Jose for awesome service!"}
{"text":"Location - Odd Atmosphere - very clean and sharp Customer service - Sucks Fruit smoothie - excellent Food - terrible  Our original waitress had to take a lunch break right before our food came out so we got a fill in waitress (short redhair ) what we ordered was HORRIBLE but we tried our best to eat it and not complain. When she dropped check off we said we just want to let her know what was bad about the food. She freakin brushed us off like a fly on ice cream. Very Rude!!! It was like she took it personal. We were very polite about it and she didn't care 2 poops. So scratch this off the map."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Dishes were served dirty!"}
{"text":"Good Breakfast At A Good Price!  Denny's definitely has affordable prices for a good breakfast. I hadn't been here in a while and the same waitress has been here for every time over 10 years that I have been here with friendly service.  The menu seems a bit longer than I recalled with lots of good pictures to get you hungry.   Thanks for the free Grand Slam Breakfast for Veterans Day!  Stop by and Take A Bite Out Of Hunger!"}
{"text":"Staff is always super friendly, and the food is the same quality you get at every Denny's. We like to come here when kids eat free every Tuesdays and Thursdays! Lol"}
{"text":"RUN, DON'T WALK...we like Denny's, but this was far fetched from what we've ever experienced. We were told 15 minute wait time, not bad, but we were seated in about 20-25 minutes. Waited about 35-40 minites for our food. I gave it a one star for the workers sitting the people and the server. The server kept calm through it all even though it was quite noticeable that the patrons weren't happy. Food was less than acceptable,  yet edible. Sausage and hash browns were barely cooked. I can't say I would go back to this location. My suggestion is to be prepared for a lengthy stay if you plan to try it."}
{"text":"Tierra was awesome very friendly greeted us right away and seemed happy that we were there. Or server Sy was the best very friendly an  personable. Thanks Sy will definitely be back to this Denny's"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and the food itself is horrible. Feels like you're eating rubber - tourists in the city, if your hotel is offering free breakfast - EAT THERE it will probably taste more like food than plastic.   The service however was really good, me and my boyfriend had a coupon and even though we were supposed to print it out our server still gave us the discount which was very nice of him.   We paid around 40$ including a tip definitely not worth it because they're literally serving grub."}
{"text":"Waitress Glenda only came one time just to ask what our order was. Never apologized for the long wait on our food. Over an hour for food even had to wait about 20 mins to even put the order in. Service is an understatement here. I never really write reviews but since i'm still here waiting for the food.."}
{"text":"It's Dennys, food is good, coffee is bad, service is adequate.  Chicken and sausage quesidilla were good. Grand sandwich was good."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Denny's place and the family eats there at least once or twice a week.  Usually order online and they are always pleasant over the phone every time.  Always quick with your order and within 20 minutes the order is usually ready to go fresh and hot.  Hit and miss on whether or not it is packed, as it is connected to the Tahiti Village resort, but it is worth the wait.  This is one of the better Denny's to go to.  Great staff, good food and nice clean atmosphere.  And you really can't beat Denny's 2-4-6-8 menu.  Love the pancake puppies sundaes!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Service was good. You just aren't allowed to order a single pancake or choose how many French toast you want."}
{"text":"I eat breakfast here often. First I find the employees here really nice especially the lady at the front desk (black hair and glasses).  I always get the same thing....the Hearty Breakfast Skillet which is delicious  and always comes out piping hot. The sausage that comes with this skillet is really good and different, it is spicier than their breakfast sausage but less spicier than their chorizo. They do the very best they can when it is extremely busy. Also they take care of our military with a military discount. They accept competitors coupons at this location  which makes me keep coming back. You can also check online and in the papers for Denny' discount coupons."}
{"text":"Service is usually decent, however, that is not the case at 2:40 AM on Friday March 30th 2018. Our waiter got high while on his shift and said he was \"caught up in the kitchen.\" It would make sense if he was actually caught up in the kitchen if there was actually other people in the restaurant. He comes to our table finally ready to take our order after us waiting for 30 minutes and he comes over stumbling, doesn't know what he's saying, squinty eyes, and doesn't bother to write down our order and has to come back to use twice to ask what our order is again. I understand it is almost 3 in the morning and service is usually slow but I find it unacceptable that our waiter decided to get high on our shift. I will never come back here at this time of night."}
{"text":"We stopped by today at around 3pm. The dining room was not super busy as everyone that was seated other than us had their meals. We sat down and ordered our food and drinks. My children's food came out quickly but my daughters yoghurt came out very watery. It was so thin that it was falling out the bowl the second you stuck a spoon into it. When it came time for my grandmother and I to receive our food, it sat in the window for probably 10 minutes before our waiter came to grab it. The other waiter had to remind ours twice to grab our plates.   The only other problem I have is with the restroom. All the doors have problems with closing and there was no toilet paper in two of the three stalls. I checked for an extra roll somewhere, but there were none. We were very disappointed today."}
{"text":"O.K. for your late-night hunger but I've had better. Of special note: Don't fall for the Fantastic Four commercial that features the \"Thing Burger.\" I tried it. It looks like it would be great, but it's really tasteless. Salt, pepper, ketchup, nothing helped."}
{"text":"The cure for the night before. I'm sure everyone in here in hungover...except for the kids I have not been the biggest fan of their pancakes so I decided to go with something else. They have definitely made some menu updates, there were several things I wanted but the way my hangover was setup I could only have one. I ordered the honey jalape√±o sriracha bacon burger. It was definitely a good choice & I was not upset with it. They were kind of stingy on the french fries which tasted pretty well, I believe these were the seasoned ones that the waiter recommended."}
{"text":"Great customer service from Zane, it was late night but service was not watered down due to the time of day, his service was energetic and personable and very attentive to my husband and I. The food was served quick and fresh."}
{"text":"This Denny's is pretty much the ultimate Denny's Experience you can get.  Situated on the Strip right across of the Mirage Volcano!  We got seating right at the window for a view.  The lights dim when it becomes time for the Volcano across the street to erupt!   It makes for interesting photo opportunities and a memorable meal.  The ambiance could be described as casual to romantic.  It is what you make of it!  Take a date here or take the whole family, it all seems just as appropriate.  At this Denny's my wife and I got mushroom hamburgers.  They were juicy, delicious and came out in a timely fashion.  The waitresses were very astute in their duties and we were left not longing for more.  If you're on the strip and looking for a affordable meal with a great view, definitely give this one a try."}
{"text":"we had called to place an order , but they never answered so we went and decided to see what was going on and there was no one at the front desk."}
{"text":"We had called to get my order to go and said they would take 10-15 minutes for them to be ready. we didn't get there until 25 minutes after and when we arrived to pay the pancakes they weren't ready yet. He had wanted us to pay first and then he would place the order, he even asked for a tip. wouldn't recommend. The pancakes we ordered were uncooked and the eggs were grease"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up.  Staff rude...,cashier sneezing on the food wait staff with fingernails an inch long.  Charged me my full order but did not give me my full order and did not give a receipt.   All in all awful experience."}
{"text":"After a late night in Old town filled with drinks, bars, and shenanigans , where else would my friends and I go?! Love love love Dennys and all of it's glory. The grand slams are absolutely out of this world and the Oreo shake is PERFECTION from what I remember. I think the service was great for the hour of night/morning. I came home (using UBER of course) feel full, satisfied and ready to sleep. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We walked in and the first thing we smelled was sewage. We had to get the host attention to be greeted and asked how many were eating me.  We asked to be seated away from the smell and they tried sitting next to the bathrooms after making it clear that we were displeased with it."}
{"text":"Came for a quick lunch and we were left waiting for about 10 minutes before some one approached  us to be seated. Multiple servers kept passing by and chatting behind the counter and would only say ill be right with you. When we were finally seated our server had such a low voice i could not hear him and had to ask to repeat everything before giving up.... on my order i asked no mushrooms no onions and my food had plenty of mushrooms... and they forgot part of my order.... after getting our food corrected we started eating. Then we waited another 15 minutes after we were done waiting on our bill. When he finally dropped it off we went and paid and the manager made a genuine effort to apologized"}
{"text":"I want to start this review with the fact that if I could give them a zero I would. So after ordering the food I receive it with one half of my two-and-a-half-year-old Suns food my food was made with onions when specifically ordered it without and we had no silverware. Then when I ask for the manager (Caren) comes over replaces my sandwich with a new one which was great but then precedes to disappear and I get my check and still full price no compensation for all of the issues. Absolutely horrible I will never come back to this place and it's sad too because our little area needed a place like this just not a place like this one."}
{"text":"The hostess sat us at a table that is designed to expand to the table adjacent to us for larger groups. We sat maybe 20 inches from total strangers with his toddler. Both were quiet but just too close. Made me uncomfortable for the whole duration. Food was quick and I'm a fan of Denny's anyhow (pancakes). The carpet was quite dirty which makes the whole place seem dirty. Just an observation"}
{"text":"Super busy and the food is overcooked. My over medium eggs had a hard yoke. My medium steak was hard and crispy around the edges. I'm starving so I'm going to eat it."}
{"text":"The service was terrible tonight. Juan does not come and check on you at all. I ran out of water multiple time. My friends ordered food with pico and the food came with nothing on it. My food was cold. And my appetizer  was served with my entr√©e. This place is a mess. I do not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"We stopped coming to this Denny's years ago because of the condition of the restaurant and the management. A couple years ago, things turned around. Remodel and new management. Wait staff had a turnover, as well, and service improved dramatically. We really enjoy our breakfast stops. Geri is awesome. Fast, friendly, and kind. Thanks for the great breakfast stop."}
{"text":"I tried this Denny's twice.  The first time me and my wife ordered our food and after 50 minutes and everyone around us who had gotten there after us ate and left already she asked how much longer  and magically the waitress stood in the kitchen for about five minutes and came out with our order.  So we gave them the benefit of the doubt because they were so busy we decided to give them a second try the next day. Im not sure which is worse waiting an hour to get pancakes or waiting 25 minutes to have a waitress come and ask me what i would like to drink, because thats what happened the second day. The food is great but the service is just awful. I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Denny's is one of those places you go to have something different for breakfast. Now that they have the different kinds of skillets give them a little more of an advantage than Cracker Barrel. This might be the reason why the wait time during the weekend is around 30-45 to be expected. Yet its really worth it the only thing missing is the servers. They never really check if you need anything. I always find myself having to go look for someone for items that are missing."}
{"text":"i have gone in and food is slow and the manager you can here always yelling at the cooksw so evryone can here. very disrespectful. trying to eat and i guess must be end of shift this kids with messed up hair and looks to be a black lethery wet apron comes out to mop floor for no reason nothing spilled. grant it was only 4 pm. very gross. comes back out another person with a cart taking the dirty dishes to clean and dumps 1 of the tubes with food and picks up with hand and doesnt sweepo it up for like another 5 minutes so having to look at what must be mac n cheese. and others to.   HOW ARE THEY STILL OPEN?????"}
{"text":"I went there around noon and the wait was not very long, but we got seated on a little table in the middle of the isle, everybody was hitting us on their way, and the waitresses with their strollers kept hitting us. It was very bad and uncomfortable. We waited along time for our food and when it arrived it was cold! The employees are not friendly, and the place is very unorganized and does not feel welcoming. Its a shame because the food itself tastes good, but its not worth their level of chaos."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes to be seated. They graciously seated a group before us who came in after us. Another small group came in after us and waited several minutes.. And when the host finally came she tried to seat them first. We really should have taken that as a sign but we were hungry.  After ordering and receiving drinks we didn't see our waiter for another 15 minutes. We did watch as members of the staff stood around chatting.  We don't go to Dennys often, now it looks like we'll never go again."}
{"text":"What a disappointing dinner, waited all week to go out with the family and the kids wanted to come here. I ordered a burger with curly fries, came out with regular fries instead. My sons French toast came out without bananas. Other sons spaghetti came out without meatballs, wife's fries were severely undercooked. Asked for these things to be fixed and by the time they were our food was gone. I let our server Tyler know we were unhappy and the response was \"sorry, here's your bill.\" Walked up to pay, told him I was unhappy again and offered a lame 15% off. Bad service, poor quality food and an unhappy ex-customer."}
{"text":"So amazing and nice employees. Great food like great. It's weird that it's this good but I come here once a week and it is godly"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this Denny's. They really don't get enough credit. The place is ALWAYS clean, it has awesome cooks, and probably the friendliest staff of any restaurant I've been to, recently!! It just has a feel good environment and GREAT food!!  They are really good with custom orders and the customer service is phenomenal,  to say the least. I definitely enjoyed EVERYTHING, to a T at this place, this morning!!  I'd recommend this location to anyone..."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Denny's in the United States that i have been to ! Not only is it the best Denny's i have been to , it is also the best breakfast locally ! The food looked great and is fresh. Im sure the lunch and dinner is excellent as well. All the  staff are really friendly and have 5 star customer service !"}
{"text":"I'm honestly shocked at these reviews.  We've been regulars for years every Saturday morning.  The service is always stellar and the food is consistent and exactly what you'd expect for Denny's.  It isn't gourmet, folks.  I love that the specialty menu items change and I love the healthy options."}
{"text":"Food was good and cooked how we wanted. The place was clean and our server was great. You can't ask for more than that in a Denny's. nice alternative to spending money since it is right next door. I'm not a fan of chain breakfast establishments but this place serves the purpose. Conveniently next door and open 24 hours."}
{"text":"My food was cold, eggs were hard and there was a hair in my food. I am not satisfied with this crap! The manager was helpful and so was our waiter but you can't take back what happened. I do not recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"if i could rem our waitress, name i would shout her out but all i rem is her telling us to call her \"momma\" and omg did she take care of us, it was just like she was our mother feeding us a sunday breakfast. denny's is cheap, and you know what your getting- i have never had such a good experience with dennys food until the morning we went here. next time in vegas, def stopping in and sitting in her area."}
{"text":"I don't know why you would stay opened with no A/C. Never mind that, but my server was impatient and would walk away before I was done ordering. Then my APPETIZER  didn't get to the table until my food did. Then she hasn't brought my toast STILL. IM SITTING HERE WRITING THIS WHILE WAITING FOR MY TOAST so I can eat my sunny side up eggs. I'll eat cold eggs I guess?? The food on one of two plates were all burnt. I can hear your cook saying \"bitch\" in the back. My server since the food was dropped off hasn't checked on us. Shall I go in? Worst Denny's in the history of all dennys. The only way you guys will get a five star is five stars for the worst dennys"}
{"text":"4 stars for DENNY'S? What? Yeah I know.  I have to give them props though, open 24 hours, big fat menu of tasty diner food.  Mainly, I like Denny's because I'm SUPPOSED to be on a diet, and they have a great light menu, with all sorts of surprisingly good food that won't make your butt bigger. Service at this location can be a little hit or miss. They're friendly, but sometimes in the wee hours of the night I think they just get a little sleepy and slowed down.  So yeah, near me, tasty, cheap, open 24 hours, offers lighter options for when the angel on my shoulder pokes me in the eye."}
{"text":"Wow so I came in tonight and was sat immediately by an unenthusiastic host. The host sat us at a booth with a huge rip in the booth. The host also neglected to give extra silverware and placemats for the other two people. So we sat without em for a while.  Server greeted us with \"what do you want to drink\" Really? That's hospitable. Server forgot my orange juice so I had to ask another server to bring it to me almost 10 minutes later.  I ordered some berry pancake and egg combo. The pancakes were ok. The were prob the only edible thing on the dish. My turkey bacon was cold. I told her my boyfriends was cold too but she only brought me bacon and not him? Also she asked for my bacon back on a side plate? I didn't even tel her my hash browns were cold too and my eggs were sitting in a pile of grease. It was quite inedible. I pushed the eggs and hash browns to the side of the table to the edge and the sever didn't take the hint. I felt like sh*t having to pay for food that was that bad. There was no manager in sight to even remotely fix anything.   My server Alicia W had some good moments with us, but not enough to save this experience.  Someone at my table said \"it's dennys what do you expect\"  To me that aggravates me because \"just dennys\" is taking my money and other people's money for what? Just because it's dennys doesn't mean you can't have a good meal or experience, I don't know why it's hard.   This store is not like any I've been to. It was completely dead and had this bad of an experience. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving morning seems to be the one time that business sleep a bit in Vegas.  After trying to hit up Eggworks and then Marie Callendar's for breakfast, we hit on our third chance choice and got in for a breakfast at Dennys.  Service?  None.  Very scatterbrained and inconsistent.  Food?  Nothing is better than biscuits and gravy with a side of hash browns and gravy.  Until the indigestion sets in.  Price?  Still one of the cheapest joints around - although it appears that's for a reason.  But hey - it's Denny's so I won't thrash them too hard.  They're still responsible for subsisting me on many drunk nights on the magic $20 I find in my pocket."}
{"text":"I go to this location often and the service is a hit and miss. Depending on what time of the day you go of course. Most servers are nice some faster than others. The Food is not consistent during dinner. I wouldn't get any salads since they use pre washed greens and taste dry and dirty like they need to be washed. I would also avoid any dishes with roasted potatoes or chorizo both are most likely gonna be over cooked. If you have kids avoid the pizza it's never cooked properly. It always looks microwaved. The Burgers, sandwiches, pastas, finger food are good. Breakfast is usually on point anytime. Remember you don't go to places like Denny's expecting fine dining. You cause they are open and cheap lol."}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. I went in today and they had more staff than customers. I waited at least 10 minutes and no server acknowledged my table. They were too busy sitting on their asses playing with silverware and napkin dispensers. I finally went to the register and was told they were sorry they forgot about my table. Spoke to the manager on shift and he really wasn't concerned. Still wasn't helped and finally left."}
{"text":"Service was bad. Portions tiny. It took about an hour to get our food and the place wasn't busy. We'll be sticking with IHOP, they have better service and portion size."}
{"text":"This was first time I have ever been to Denny's. I now see why they are so busy. Food was hot and fresh, price was good and the service friendly and professional. Check out fast and easy with tip button on screen for different %. I will return. These people are doing a good job!"}
{"text":"Worst service! Took forever to get drinks, asked for pancakes out first and never came.  Missing food several occasions, food was cold.  One of the items was a skillet and it was cold.  Asked for coffe three times before I got it filled once.  Eggs were improperly cooked.  Never received an apology and were asked to pay full price.  Never coming here again !"}
{"text":"Wow...We all know Denny's is not known to be the best, however this location is terrible. Its a real shame to because it wasn't always this bad. Its right near my house and a fairly new location. Every time I go there it gets a little worse but lets focus on my most recent visit there...  We get seated by a server who redefines the word incompetent. She takes forever to take our drink orders, then walks by and asks if our food order has been taken. Shouldn't you know? You're the waiter. Then she takes the order then returns with my drink, a cup of coffee. The cup I got looked like the last person who drank out of it was a cheap call girl that applied way too much lip stick, Denny's decided it was too complicated to wash the cup so served my drink in it. Dirty tables, covered in debris was also a nice plus.  I was not offered anything when I advised staff about this. All I got was a forced I'm sorry.........I will not be back."}
{"text":"Spring training is over, high season in Scottsdale is over. There is no reason the lady sitting next to me waited 40 minute and her food was still not ready and there was absolutely no reason my two eggs over medium with hash browns and toast was going to take 30 to 40 minutes. Without question one of the most poorly operated locations I have ever been to. It's not like the food is that great it's not like I waited an hour for a seat. I simply won't be going back it is so not worth the frustration and the food is not even that cheap. I just wanted something quick and simple. I'll go to breakfast club or morning squeeze or daily dose from now on."}
{"text":"I know, I know... it's Denny's in the middle of the strip in Las Vegas, what am I supposed to expect?   Well, decent service would've been good.   Thankfully we came by on a Tuesday morning and I'm sure it wasn't as bad as a weekend, but we just needed something quick before our drive home.  We got our food in a decent amount of time, however, the service leading up to it and afterward wasn't the greatest. Not sure if a staff issue, but there was a lot of employees hanging around so it's tough to say.   Unless it's your birthday and you're up for a free grand slam, I would go somewhere nicer!"}
{"text":"Since all of the Denny's on the strip have crazy wait times on Saturday morning, fianc√© and I decided to drive to one off the strip.  So we arrived here and were immediately seated. I LOVED the build your own skillet, which is apparently a seasonal Denny's thing right now.   Our food came out in a reasonable time but our waitress was dealing with a few difficult customers around us so we never even got refills nor asked if we were okay. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that their service is better than what we received.   Will probably return to this location next time we're in town.."}
{"text":"It's my birthday and first place I'm going to is Denny's for my free Birthday Grand Slam!   I was pleasantly surprised when our wait for breakfast was only 3 minutes at 10 AM.  The tables... suuuper close, so don't expect a lot of privacy if you get a table instead of a booth. However, we did get our food pretty quickly and my girlfriend and I really enjoyed the word search table mats while we waited!    Great place for breakfast if you're looking for some on the strip... 24 hours a day"}
{"text":"I have never hated a Denny s so much in my life. And stupid me, I've given this place three chances to impress me because it's conveniently located. Every time I have been not satisfied. The employees don't care about you or their job, the food takes forever and is not perfectly made and I feel like the overall time being in that damn place is never less than an hour and a half. I'm sorry we have places to be when were in Vegas, I like to be in control of my time, not you."}
{"text":"We come here every year for Christmas dinner!! This is the BEST Denny's in town! Very friendly staff and showed Christmas spirit for having to work on Christmas Day. The food is ok but we don't come here for that. It gives me a break from the kitchen!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sirloin steak (medium rare) with mashed potatoes and brocoli with a side of garlic bread. Bread came out burnt and the sirloin was rare. I had to send it all back. When I was finally able to eat the stwak and brocoli were saturated in pepper. Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress dropped off order and disappeared for ten minutes. This was only a problem as she'd brought the wrong order.  By the time I tracked her down, everything was cold. She was duly apologetic and got it right on the second try.  At least the \"bold\" coffee was good."}
{"text":"This is your classic Dennys.   Typical of those you may see in the USA.   The best part is that it is the only one in the local area of Vaughan and one of just a handful in the GTA.  Good prices and reasonable food."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. 25 minutes before someone waited on us.  10 min to get our drinks.  Over one hour later another table questioned what was taking so long -  only to have the \"manager\" cone out with a attitude and said basically tough it's gonna be another thirty minutes - when I said it was ridiculous her response was oh well and walked away.  Stay away from this dump.  Oh and no toilet paper in ladies restroom - guess that doesn't matter either.    Wish I could give zero stars for this place."}
{"text":"I was thinking about the Denny's promo and how bad I felt for the servers who didn't get any tips since the meal they were serving was free. For you mathematically-challenged Yelpers - $0 meal = $0 tip :) Then I started thinking about all the Denny's I've been too and if any of them stood out. And this is the one that stood out...well not specifically this location, but a server we had one morning. This lady was AWESOME!!! I can't for the life of me remember her name though. I don't even know if she still works there, but if she does you have to hunt her section down!! She is the most motherly, loving, sweetest lady I've ever met!! She immediately greets you as you sit down and gets your drink order. She even offers suggestions if you're not sure. She includes with her service a good dousing of \"honeys, sweeties, dolls\" too. I know some people hate being called that...but you'll immediately fall in love with her gushing over you. She repeats your order to you, jokes with you and is always smiling. And she always checks on you. She even knows when you're slowing down and will immediately ask if you need a box. The icing on this wonderful experience is that she brought out our drinks in TO GO cups so we could have something to drink on the road!! I was floored...shoot...I still am! Her service was sooo outstanding I think we tipped her what our bill came out to be. And we told the manager about how awesome her service is."}
{"text":"My wife and i came here for breakfast and it was unbelievably bad. It tasted like a nursing home breakfast. That's not why i gave 1 star. The 1 star is because as we were leaving a male who was at the register said to me \"do you want to leave a tip .\" I asked what type of restaurant ask customers for tips?  He responded \" We charge a gratuity\". What? So i said i normally leave large tips but have never been asked for one, before i received a receipt. I gave my Debit card and marked a tip. My wife and i waited outside until another couple (White couple) exited and asked them were they asked for a tip and they said 'NO\". I honestly believe we were targeted that way because i was black and the server/cashier was allowing his stereotype of black people dictate his judgement."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  Horrifying experience for a mom who wants to get out of the house and have a nice brunch! Had a couple complain about my friend's 2 year old being too loud and the waitress obviously took their side hence the cringe and faces she made while helping us. Our food took forever and I had to ask for coffee refills twice. The first time the waitressJenny refilled my cup she spilled it everywhere and didn't clean my table! The waitresses gossiped about it and stared at us the entire time making me extremely uncomfortable. I am never going back here again. This is not a kid friendly place nor is it professional. Jordan their waiter should train them in customer service and common decency!"}
{"text":"When we first arrived we were handed menus and silverware and were told to \"head over to that table\"  We then had 5/5 orders come out wrong. One order of pancakes was pure batter in the middle, soupy batter.   Hash browns with cheddar cheese came out and the cheese was fresh out of the Giant Eagle package, no attempt to even melt it. When I asked for them to melt the cheese the server informed me she would throw them into the microwave for a few mins.   Table next to us had all of their orders incorrect two. A guy ordered the banana pancakes - they forgot the bananas, instead of remaking them they brought him a bowl of sliced bananas.   Will never return here again. Likely will be sick tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"Yiks this place needs a lot of work!! The food was so cold that the not so fresh fruit was warmer than it. The employees were so busy having fun with each other they forgot us and our food. The restaurant was so empty they should take a look at why. Staff should be thankful for the job.  If you are visiting the strip and think Dennys is a safe place to eat because its a big chain than think again. We were sick with stomach problems that could only be Dennys as the cause.  Go to a casino and take your chances there."}
{"text":"Once in a while, it's possible that a restaurant can have a bad night. Like going on your first date with spinach on your front tooth. But three nights in a row is not a fluke; it's an art.  My first night, I ordered their Brooklyn Spaghetti and meatballs. Had I been a Brooklyn wise-guy, somebody would be missing a knee-cap.  They served it in a soup bowl, which was appropriate for the water in the bottom. The \"garlic bread\" was subbed with some kind of flat bread with garlic butter on it. Service was minimal, and the waiter must have been on his first week of employment-- Anywhere. So I gave them another chance the next night, and ordered a sizzling platter. Served with a Filthy handle cover, and a rusty, or dirty knife. Third times a charm: Spaghetti again. Forgot the cheese. The white bread that was substituted for garlic toast, wasn't even toasted. The waiter said he was sorry, and he was right. Cleanliness wasn't an option, or a concept known to them. Suffice to say it had  all the old world charm of Tijuana."}
{"text":"Been to this Denny's twice. The first time was a Sunday Morning, around 10:30am, and naturally they were very busy. We ordered and waited and waited and waited and eventually our food arrived. It was pretty standard fare, nothing spectacular. The overly long wait  and poor service (our waitress forgot us). Management was really understanding and comped our meal, which made me come back a second time. The second time was today. We arrived to an empty restaurant. We were seated and given menus. We ordered. And we waited. It was empty today, so I think a 25 minute wait for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. The sandwich itself, was not what was represented on the menu. I wasn't in the mood to complain, so I ate it, paid, and left. Will I come back again? Nah. I'm gonna hit up IHOP on Apache/Forest."}
{"text":"You go to Denny's for a fast, value, good old American cooking. In Vegas, there's a lot of choices so you go here to get food fast. My experience her has been terrible. It took 1/2 hour for the breakfast to arrive, at lunch time. Manager apologized, saying they shut down one kitchen. Heck, NOT during a busy time. When my brother's order arrived, it was COLD and did not have the eggs. We would have had a better time at Mcdonalds across the street by Circus Circus. I've actually seen a couple get up and leave as they were not served in so long a time. Definitely a Denny's not up to snuff and I will not go back here again."}
{"text":"my kids love denny's and im glad we have them around the neighborhood. staff are attentive and friendly. food is delicious, unlike some of the denny's from another location."}
{"text":"The lady was taking forever to give out our food and seemed to do it on purpose , trying to be rude"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty generic for greasy American breakfasts haha, you get what you'd expect at a dennys, so this rating isn't for my food, this rating is for my server, Gabriel!  He was extremely attentive and sweet and didn't even seem to mind that I had ordered two entrees this morning (I planned on taking one home) and he brought me a box and a coffee to go without any asking! He really went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of. He brought me my syrup and hot sauces and coffee and juice very promptly. I would come back here just for Gabriel! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This Dennys was great! A lot of tables so there was no wait when we went. We ordered the broccoli chicken skillet and bourbon chicken skillet which were amazing! The wait for the food was minimal. The strawberry puppies were the best thing on the menu lol I think I'm going back just to have those! Was a solid 3.5 stars might have given a 4 stars if bathrooms were clean and waitress didn't take forever to refill water.   On to the bad: 1. The bathrooms look a little rough they definitely need more upkeep. 2. Waitress took forever to refill waters.  On to the good: 1. Plenty of tables so seating shouldn't take long. 2. STRAWBERRY PUPPIES 3. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Came in for a late breakfast around 10.30 and there's only 1 cashier/waitress in the entire restaurant. Way to go Dennys, Great management!"}
{"text":"First time in Denny's visiting Vegas from NYC. Hmmm NO Avoid this chain. Can we say extra extra Butter on everything including the butter? lol Yea no never again..."}
{"text":"We experienced the best service from any Dennys diner at this location. Came in for brunch one busy morning and were seated right away. This location is a part of the Tahiti Village hotel so parking was hard to find but we didnt mind because its something we expected.   Our server was Alexis and she really took care of us. Took our orders in a timely manner and answered any questions we had about the menu with a smile on her face. Our food came out and everything was just as ordered. We got the chicken philly, an all veggie skillet and a big turkey sandwhich with fries. All the food was made right just the way we wanted it. They were good portions that filled us up. Any time we asked for something our server brought it right out to us. Just the night before we went to Blueberry Hill diner and had a very bad experience, we were already skeptical of going to another diner and expecting decent food BUT this Dennys and our server Alexis made our visit a memorable one.   Everything from the service to the food to the cleanliness of the restaurant was great."}
{"text":"The service and food were fair and the wait was long."}
{"text":"The service and food were fair and the wait was long."}
{"text":"This place is night and day compared to the Denny's in Youngtown.  Our experience in this restaurant was great, Scott was a great server, kept the coffee cup full.  I'd go back to this establishment again and recommend it to others.  I spoke to the manager and complemented him on his facility.  I suggested they close down the Youngtown Denny's as the service was non-existent."}
{"text":"The grapevine around the area says the service as a whole is poor, many don't return. This Denny's must get their business from the two motels next door to be able to stay open! Their coffee has a burnt taste, suggest changing it unless the goal is to have your customers pay $2.09 for only one cup. I had to get up and refill my coffee and water in order to get more.  Many customers sat for long periods before being greeted by their server. Customers asked for items and had to remind their server after half their meal was eaten. The staff needs to pay more attention to the customers needs instead of BS'n in the back. My tip of three cents hopefully was a eye opener.  Won't be back to that restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I am a healthy eater, so Denny's isn't exactly my \"typical\" kind of eatery ;) But my husband and I happened to be in he area for breakfast on a Saturday morning (and there aren't many options in the area), and decided we'd give it a try. It looked busy when we walked in so I was concerned we'd have to wait, but they got us right in- score. Friendly waitress came right over and got us our waters, with lemons (I have to add how stoked I was to have two slices of lemon in my water- every other restaurant gives one tiny slice and considers that sufficient for \"water with lemon\"- ugh). She then gave us just the right amount of time to look over he menu, and we ordered- my husband got the \"Lumberjack Slam\" (he's not such a healthy eater, if you know anything about their menu :P), and I got the Fit Slam. While waiting for our food, I went to wash my hands in the restroom, only to find NO SOAP. Literally none at all; just some antibacterial hand sanitizer, which does not do the same job as hand-washing. It really grossed me out, because this means the employees also are not able to wash their hands after using the restroom! While this was my only negative experience there, it was icky enough to remove a star. Moving on, the food came out rather quickly, and everything I had was delightful, as well as the couple bites I had from my husband's plate. I love when healthy food tastes good, and the Fit Slam absolutely met both requirements! Yummm. Would go back... And hopefully they find some real soap for the bathroom by then!"}
{"text":"As much as I come to this Denny's, I hate this location. I come here solely on convenience for me and my friends after our basketball games because it's on the way home for the majority of us, but that is all.   I usually come here at night with my friends so I can't speak for anything more than the night staff, and not howdy, they suck sometimes. I usually come here with a large party with my friends and sometimes, they have trouble sitting us unfortunately. I understand when it gets busy which is some of the times, but a few times, it has taken more than 15 minutes with a relatively empty diner. The manager at that time said it would be that long, he goes to the back, and disappears. I know he could have easily went to go fix some tables for us, but he just decided not to. I don't think my friends noticed but I was a little upset. At night, they are also understaffed it seems with one server for a portion of the night shift. There was a time where a lot of people came in at once, and a lot of people left just because they weren't getting seated fast enough. The manager could have done a better job with helping the server, but the poor girl had to try and do everything herself but couldn't.    I still love Denny's, and I wish this location was better, but quite frankly, this one stinks."}
{"text":"Had breakfast today with the family.  Weekly tradition for Wednesdays!  Pat took care of us like she always does.  Great meal and service."}
{"text":"The wait staff is very friendly here This is one of the better Denny's around It probably has to do with putting up with those college students  All the employees seem to be patient I do like this location more than the one on Univ and the 143...   Order time here is quick and our meals arrived in a quick timely manner  Food was good I stuck with the value slam because I am not that hungry"}
{"text":"Great service. Very clean and food was good. There was only a 5 minutes wait to be seated. Much better dennys than the one near monte carlo."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Denny's for years.  They usually have decent food and decent to good servers.  It's Denny's so you know what you're getting and you're getting what you pay for.    However, I went to this location with my family after a late night out and could not have had a more terrible waitress.  There were five of us in my group and we were seated right away since it was about 4am and there were only 2 or 3 other tables with people.  Our waitress, Alisha, took our drink orders then didn't come back for about 30 minutes with 4 out of the 5 drinks.  She took our food orders and we didn't see her again until about 15 minutes later when she brought some of the orders.  My father was missing the bacon and avocado on his burger, my mother had tarter sauce on her burger instead of mayo, my uncle got no syrup or butter with his pancakes, my aunt still did not have her drink, and my order was never brought to the table.  After she dropped off the incomplete order she wandered away (there was only one other waitress there and she was handling all the other tables and working her butt off).    The next time I saw the waitress to try and flag her down she yelled across the restaurant that my order was on the way and to be patient.  Finally, we just got up to leave.  We went to the front to pay and the waitress ran over and said she was really busy so she was sorry my order didn't come.  We told her about all the issues we had, no drink refills, missing items in the orders, long waits, etc. and she continued to say we should be patient because she was busy (still only 3 other tables occupied at the restaurant and all being handled by the other waitress).  Absolutely terrible service and I can't believe the nerve of that waitress.  She deserves to be fire for service like that."}
{"text":"Really good service (I wish I remembered the ladies name).  Great personality.  Good food.  Everything went well.  It is kind of in a ghetto area though..."}
{"text":"My visit took place on Saturday 7/13/13.  The place was hopping and we were given a wait time of 25 minutes- the line moved quickly.  There is an advantage to being a party of 2.   The process they have in place isn't horrible but could be a bit better executed.  Why not have someone going from table to table refilling coffee/drinks?  The servers are already running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  Also, have several people clearing tables- the turn around would be so much faster.  Several tables went untouched while the line grew b/c the busboys needed more support.    Other than that, the food was good- I always create my own grand slam w/ hearty wheat pancakes, fruit, scrambled egg whts and an English muffin- sugar free syrup coats the pancakes nicely as the Cholula does for my eggs. I'm a happy girl as long as the dark roast is free flowing :)"}
{"text":"My Mom and I came here tonight as we've been eating out for over a month after visiting my Dad who is hospitalized. We've eaten just about everywhere in the Northwest part of town and decided to give Denny's a try.  Our server was Chris and for the most part, things were fine. Our food was great, but that opinion might be a little skewed based on the fact that we are both exhausted and we're starving. The service wasn't bad, but the dishes are all super grimy. Every glass had a ring in it and the silverware was coated in a filmy substance, so that was thoroughly disgusting. After leaving cash (which included a generous tip) on the table, we sauntered out at a snail's pace and were paid no attention. Just as we reached our cars, the manager opened the door and yelled to us to ask if we had paid. Seriously? This is where the mediocre visit completely soured. First of all, if we were trying to stiff you, don't you think we would have tried to leave a little faster? And second of all, he didn't even check to see if we had paid. I eat out VERY often and I don't appreciate being assumed to be somebody who would skip out on my bill. We definitely won't be back. This left a very bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas Eve for lunch after doing some shopping and the service was TERRIBLE.. The waitress wouldn't make eye contact with us.. Was constantly mumbling under her breath.. And waited over 15 minutes to just get an order of nachos."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst dennys i have ever been too bad service all across the board. Things were left out that i asked for so we asked the hostess for our server, he asked what was wrong we told him he said he would fix well instead he went and did other things and started talking to another employee. So after waiting over 10 mins we asked for a manager he sent our food back got it fixed . our server we gave her a chance sense it wasnt her fault but she never checked on us and it got worse so needless to say we wont be back."}
{"text":"This is the worst Denny's I have ever been to. The service was slow and the workers seemed like they had no clue of how to work in a restaurant. I got the food I ordered and it was terrible. Will never be returning here."}
{"text":"Just watched the host fall over and knock an old lady out of her seat. She's laying on the floor, manager nowhere to be seen. Be prepared to brawl if you want breakfast here.  Update: The manager showed up only AFTER the woman was helped back into her seat and the spilled drinks cleaned up, with only a half hearted apology and no inquiry if she needed medical attention."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Fluffy pancakes and Awesome employees! The new skillets are great! Especially the Crazy Spicy skillet!"}
{"text":"Kids eat free 4pm to 11 Wednesday they Sunday. AARP members get 15% off!  The staff is friendly and food is great!"}
{"text":"I had a great breakfast (the Fitfare) and the staff were great. They have a bold coffee choice also and flavored creamers. This was great, since I missed out on Starbucks this morning. It was actually very satisfying.  My friend ordered a stack of pancakes for $2. Not a bad deal.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Denny's has changed, at least at this location. Used to be our \"go to\" restaurant for a weekend brunch. We usually order two seniors plates with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes. We used to be able to substitute one of the pancake orders for toast. Nice option that gave us both to share. Not any more, if you substitute anything, they now charge extra. No small orange juice anymore - just the large - more revenue. Staff claims the changes are initiated at head office. No Calgary Sun newspapers anymore. On top of all that, the quality and portion sizes are both heading south. We've decided its not the option that it once was - too many things have deteriorated at this location."}
{"text":"I'm going to begin by saying that this place has an unfair reputation. With that said, I can see why. I've seen my waitress once so far. The cook came to us and took our order, he was very pleasant. Now, I know being a server is difficult, because I am one. There are two waitresses here and they seem to be struggling. My dining room is at least 4 times larger than this and I am always solo. Gotta be quick and gotta multitask. The food is really good, and the dining room has been remodeled, so disregard what you've read about the cold temperature. If I do come back, it will be done so with the knowledge that I have to serve myself when I am here. You can't remodel yourself out of a bad staff."}
{"text":"How good can it be? It is Denny's after all.   Food was hot and bland. Coffee just water with black color. Everything one would expect from this place.  Service was wonderful, as is the norm at the chain. Wish they would take the food seriously."}
{"text":"I'm being nice w/ 2 stars. My parents & I stopped here in route to southern Illinois. It wasn't all that crowded when we went but my bottom line is this.  1. Server REALLY didn't seem interested to serve us. Maybe she was having an off-day but not to be offered a refill on Coke (and once for coffee) is something that has NEVER happened in the many decades I've visited a Denny's around the USA.  2. When I walked in, I noticed everyone was wearing a sweatshirt or a coat. I wondered why. Then after about 5 minutes or so, I realized one thing. I've been in warmer meat lockers than that location. I'm NOT one to get cold easily either.  3. My parents breakfast seemed to be good. My burger was DRY. It was warm at first but the more I ate it, the more dry it became. It was almost like they reheated it.   4. The Diner-like feel (inside & outside) gave me a hope of something better. Next trip to this town (VERY nice outlet mall & a good place to stretch), I won't stop here. Highly doubtful anyway.   I'm guessing this chain is going through changes. When you can't keep a location open near one of the America's largest JUCO's (DuPage, which had done historically well), that might tell me something. There aren't as many Denny's as they once were. Maybe service & execution is the reason why."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food even slower and it was barely room temp when we finally did get it. It's Denny's, so you can't expect the food to be amazing, and as far as Denny's goes, it was okay.   Also, our table wasn't the only one that had orders wrong or food missing. (Took 10 minutes for the guy behind me to get just toast). Seems like the cooks didn't know what they were doing.   Probably wont go back. There's much better food and service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Though not the cleanest Denny's I've been to, the service is really nice so I'll keep coming back.   The dirty that I'm referring to is in between the double-pane windows is soap film that makes it look like the windows are really dirty, but I know it really isn't on the inside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I normally love Denny's and was thrilled to see this one right in the parking lot of my hotel.  Perfect!  I went over the first evening of my stay.  It was later - likely 8 pm ish. There weren't many customers in the restaurant but the service was incredibly slow.  I was seated at the counter and had to wait several minutes before anyone even asked if my order had been taken.  I ordered coffee (which was never refilled after the first cup), and a build your own slam.  The food sat on the counter (heat lamps were not on) for a while before it was given to me so it was cool.  Then I had to personally reach over the counter to get my own silverware, and had to hunt someone down in order to pay.  I was in town for a week.  I never went back...."}
{"text":"went up and fucking down this freemont street crap, (first time after like being in vegas for 1000 times)...lemme say complete waste of time except for the golden nugget. And literally NOTHING to eat, no quick fast food, no sit down rests, only a dennys....so by default steered here. Let me say I dont like dennys, and would never eat at one, but it was 3pm, stomach growling and a bitching and complaining 10-year old that wants to get fed.  Pleasantly surprised; I mean not blown away but with such scummy expectations it was a decent meal.  Grilled chicken avocado sandwich (mine) was quite tasty...no really. Wifes prime rib salad weak by my standards, even for a dennys but she enjoyed it. Topped with piknik shoestring potatoes, interesting. Son has burger looked horrible upon arrival but he liked it. The berry blackjack smoothie was great, highlight of the meal. I wish I got our servers name; she was a very sweet young black lady, sorry thats all I got. Enjoy those ghetto lard-asses and their overstretched tattoos while you dine! Man just cant pay less than this....$35 was the cheapest meal on our trip."}
{"text":"Ok I usually like Denny's and based on the food and service it gets 3 stars. The food was quite good and a bang for your buck. The young gentleman who waited on us got a fat tip. He was on point. The reason it's not a 5 star Denny's are the two downfalls of the visit. One it was dead and it was messy. Food crumbs in the window seal and all over the carpet. There were only 4 customers and about 6 employees so that was unnecessary. Second they had an employee meeting going on and they were loud and obnoxious. It was almost uncomfortable hearing their rants. The manager should've kept them quieter although her service was good as well."}
{"text":"I would love to give a negative star review.  Waiter had no customer service whatsoever, food was cold and people who came after my fiance and I were served before we were. Eggs were soggy and not cooked all the way  Whole plate felt like it was sitting for an hour in the microwave. Never experienced a Denny's like this before . Will not be coming back here again. Manager was very helpful in the situation."}
{"text":"Having not been to a Denny's in a while, I must say I was rather impressed with the quality of the food, I got a chessebuger, fries and a salad. The burger was a fresh, handmade patty and was juicy and flavorful. The fries, although not plentiful, were crisp and golden. The salad was loaded with fresh veggies and was one of the better dinner salads I've had in recent memory. The Mrs. got the Prime Rib Cobb Salad, which looked fantastic. Too bad they didn't offer a half size, as it was huge. There were very few people inside and there was no waiting at all upon arrival. The waitress, Anna, was very attentive and the manager even came around to check on us. The good time oldies music playing was a nice touch. This is a good place to go if you can't decide what exactly it is you are hungry for. The menu had plenty of variety and the food was pretty good. I am going with four stars, compared to similar establishments, based on the service and the quality of the food. I would love to see if they can duplicate the same quality and service when they are busy."}
{"text":"I didn't go to Denny's expecting a five star dining experience and certainly didn't set the bar too high, but I was at least expecting a typical \"Denny's\" experience. This visit fell short in many ways.  We were seated promptly, but that is where the promptness ended.   We sat for quite a while before a server even came to the table to take drink orders. When she finally arrived, she was surprised that we wanted to order and wasn't prepared for that. When she brought the drinks out, she told the table next to us that they needed to exercise patience with her because she was brewing more coffee. Our coffee was cold and old and the $2.15 orange juice was much smaller than anticipated.  Although it took quite a while to get our meal, the food actually tasted OK and the country fried steak was in line with other Denny's locations. The downside here is that the food was cold just like the coffee was.   You would think a Saturday morning at Denny's would feature piping hot coffee and quick hot meals. That was definitely not the case on this morning. Breakfast for two with coffee and orange juice for both was just south of $30. I think there are too many other breakfast options in the area for a return trip."}
{"text":"4 numbers for you $2, $4, $6, and $8. Those are Denny's new menu option...not to mention all you can eat pancakes and French Fries. This particular location is great...plenty of parking, seating both inside and out and the service is great as well. I know Denny's is a chain and most are probably the same to most people...but if your ever near this particular one....give them a try and i promise you won't think it is like the other's. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Came into Denny's had server Gabe and Manager Kim, these two are awesome. Very helpful , wonderful customer service, glasses stayed full , food came out perfect. Will be making this our regular spot to eat. Thank you Denny's for these two need more like them!"}
{"text":"I got seasoned fries, baja quesadilla it was so good Damekia was our waitress she showed us hustle and was very nice."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the family. And our server Jeanie was wonderful. Definitely will come back and request to be seated in her section."}
{"text":"Extremely digusted that there is very strong bromhidrosis in the green apple! And the T-bone, hash brown was too over cook and dry! And they always forget to give me the hot chocolate! I wish they could stay well like the first time that I order!"}
{"text":"5 stars for my server jami!!!! And her manager!! My tbone steak come out WD , when i order medium!!! They fix it like a proffesional server shoud do!!!! Good job guys !!! See you soon."}
{"text":"Apparently this Dennys location doesn't understand the concept of service. A group of 6 of us came here for a breakfast before our flight out. We were seated at our table. After that no one came to our table to greet us, not even water was provided or a drink order taken. We waited twenty minutes till I went and spoke to a server who was hanging out in a group near the drinks, informed him of the situation, he asked what table we were at. Five minutes later, still nothing. We were completely ignored. So we left. On the way out informed the host that they had a table of 6 open now because they didn't serve us for 25 minutes. Absolutely the worst experience at any dine in location ever.   Vegas you will not be missed."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes and still did NOT get my order!   Does it really take that long for eggs and bacon?    They are a breakfast place after all!    I was being totally ignored.  Other people came in after me and got their food.   This location NEVER has enough wait staff.  I don't know what is up with that.    Finally told my waiter I was leaving and he didn't say anything.  And by the way, they have the worst napkins -- might as well be using tissue paper."}
{"text":"Denny's food is just whatever but the service sucks. My fork had food on it for one. There was only one server and she didn't even ask us if we needed anything. I wouldnt recommend this location"}
{"text":"It is Denny's.   We all know what to expect.  This particular restaurant is the most consistent with food and service.  Have not received bad service or food here.  Often times we have received exceptional service.  Have frequented this restaurant regularly.  It is on my list of regulars."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's - don't expect 5 star food. But I will say the service was great. Our server's name was Shannon, and he was extremely friendly and personable. He was hilarious, too. This location is right in the center of the strip, across from the Mirage. Convenient for a quick bite to eat, without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"We have dined here frequently but lately is going downhill fast.  Ordered a chicken filly sandwich go to pick up and they tell me they don't have the buns for it did I want it on sourdough toast, I declined and ordered from the location by Old Towne Scottsdale to get the sandwich we wanted.  Last night ordered a double cheeseburger with fries, the bun was so soggy so unusable, lettuce was severely wilted, tomato was terrible and very small amount of fries.  So called to speak to manager Nathan explained situation to him he did offer to make another one no thanks and then offered gift card and call this am from district manager well now almost 3pm and still no call.  So pick a different location."}
{"text":"Food is ok the usual for Denny's but this one you need to look at the dishes. Almost every dish had dried food on them."}
{"text":"FYI - UPDATED REVIEW  10/2017:  Horrible service, mediocre food!!  My family & I were really excited that a Denny's opened up in a Surprise.  Sadly, it was a huge disappointment.  When we arrived, the restaurant didn't have a lot of people there.  I thought this would mean that we would get our food fairly quickly.  Not the case!  With restaurants, I know it's not fast food & I expect waiting time for our food, but after waiting for 20 minutes, we had to ask for our drinks twice.  15 more minutes after flagging down our waitress to remind her again about our drinks, we finally get our drinks & our orders taken.  Mind you, the place wasn't packed or busy.  When we received our food, we had waited so long that we just wanted to eat & get out.  Doubt we will be back at this location again.  Really sad since we were looking for to a family restaurant in town.  2/2018 My Family & I decided to return to Denny's in hopes of a better experience.  Glad we did!  Service & food were good and a huge change from our last time there.   Looking forward to returning.  Good job Denny's!"}
{"text":"I'll give the food a 4 star. My food was nice and warm, nothing wow but it's better than my cooking. There is something that makes me want to go back to certain places and it is nice people. I've been at this location a couple of times and I always get good service. Today, my family and I went for dinner and we had this amazing server named Joe. He was so nice and helpful. We hope to see him next time. His customer service skills get a 5 star."}
{"text":"Very nice waitress. The food was hot and delicious. The best part, they supplied my mom with an endless amount of coffee  :]"}
{"text":"Great service and great breakfast after a night out! The jalape√±o honey bacon was worth the extra $ - so good! Thanks for giving us energy and treating us so great!"}
{"text":"The service is lousy.  First it took a while to get a waiter. Then he was slow with the drinks. After that he was really slow with the food and never came with refills.   We finally got the food. they forgot part of my order and my friends were mixed up. We never got the check either.  So we ended going up to the cashier and he pulled it. When we finally get in the car, I figure we spent an hour and 45 minutes! !  Unless you want to waste time DON'T GO TO THIS DENNYS."}
{"text":"I ordered gluten free English muffins and I got gluten free buns.  I addressed this to the waitress and she apologized and brought over English muffin.  Without my knowledge, it was NOT gluten free English muffin.  I am paying a horrible price for eating it.  I ordered gluten free for a reason. My first cup of coffee was cold!"}
{"text":"Great place. Neat atmosphere. Nice people and the food was very good. Nice to have a Blue collar restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with their food. Their pancakes r usually very moist but not today. Their bacon n sausage looked old. The sausage was awful I asked our waitress why it look n tasted that way she mentioned it was pre-cooked no wander! The manager was kind enough to give us a discount but will not return to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience at a restaurant at this location 8 person group it 30mins before being waited on with a 2hr wait and when asked when we would be served they said 45 mins business lost."}
{"text":"went in here twice the first time it was around 8:30pm on a Tuesday night and there were about 5-6 people sitting in there with a bunch of open booths and tables and when we walked in the waitress said it'll be about a 15 min wait then went back to work as i'm sitting there this waitress doesn't even bother to take my name down so that's bad customer service so i decided to leave due to the rudeness. Second time i came back today for brunch and it was all going well except i wanted to change french toast to pancakes on a meal that came with bacon sausage eggs hash browns and toast but my waitress stated that they couldn't switch them so i had to do a build your own but then when i received my meal they gave me ONE piece of bacon and ONE piece of sausage like seriously just one piece each wtf is that?? then when i went to go pay i wanted to split the meal on 2 cards but the waiter behind the cash register seemed very confused and said he couldn't split it that seems to be wrong since i've split it on cards before at other dennys locations the Customer service at this dennys location is AWFUL i will NOT be returning here to give them my business!"}
{"text":"Here for 2 hours because serving too forever. Served me a sandwich without meat by accident. Staff is polite. Seems like the servers have too many responsibilities."}
{"text":"I don't usually review places like Denny's for the reason I never get good service. BUT this locations I have visited about 4 times in the past year First two times I was amazed service and food was awesome. So I though to myself is this because its on the Vegas Strip ? But my most two recent visits, last visit 10-2014 it was just sad. Server was nice but food was cold took about 30 min to be seated management was very helpful. I love this Denny's and would like to come back but they need improvement."}
{"text":"The service was good we had a friendly waitress and the food was good. It is what you would expect from any Denny's. The restaurant itself has really bad parking. The inside of the restaurant was really dirty I could not tell if they ever even swept or mopped the floors. There were no people in some areas and I saw food on the floor (half pieces of bread and more), there was napkins and creamer/jelly opened containers just thrown. The bathrooms were really dirty in the corners it was black from who knows what. Someone somewhere was slacking in the cleaning part of this place which sucks because the waitress and food were good."}
{"text":"The service and the food at this location were great! Our waitress Katrina was awesome despite it being jam packed on a Sunday. She was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. The food was all cooked perfectly and came out in a timely manner considering how busy it was. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars was because I overheard the manager speaking to one of the employees and he was very rude to them almost demeaning. I thought that was disrespectful especially doing it in front of customers."}
{"text":"The wait was long today. The place was packed.  Not the norm here.  The normal wait is usually about 10 minutes.  We opted to sit at the bar where it's first come first serve.  We did have to elbow a few elderly to get the seats.  Not really!   The bar was a life saver as my urgent need for pancakes was at a dangerous level."}
{"text":"Not once but twice we were cut off. First when we tried to check in and then when we tried to pay. When we brought that up they didn't even apologize! Waiter wasn't even that great, as many times as we have been here this was the worst. Guess I can't expect much from Denny's. Won't be back anymore"}
{"text":"Sometimes you need breakfast for dinner! A coworker of mine had a craving today so a few of us in the office came to eat. Totally hit the spot. Shout out to the server Dwayne, who made our tasty dinner even more awesome with his superior serving skills."}
{"text":"Poor service took 10 minutes for water. Server was absolutely terrible, ignored us at all cost and came to our table one time throughout the visit! His name was Ariel I think was his name HORRIBLE. At least the food was alright other wise I would have been livid."}
{"text":"While this is the only place I have ever been banned from,  I do have very fond memories of too much coffee and cigarette smoke in high school. Good times. . . . but seriously. . . how do you ban a teenager \"for life\"? Their words. . . I have been back since. I am such a rebel."}
{"text":"nice new Dennys..   i haven't been to Dennys in many years.  Way more staff that was needed but I guess that's part of being new."}
{"text":"If I could give a rating of ZERO, I would. Lack of management and a blatant disregard for professionalism has created a chasm of abysmal service accompanied by a consistent state of denial that something is fundamentally wrong. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"I'm really upset about this place. The place is a hell of a mess nobody sweeps the floor and bad service as well, we got our drinks in about 10 minutes later and we finally got our food but still no silverware on our table."}
{"text":"Despite how busy it gets, one of the hosts stayed upbeat and even a little funny. I think that was great because it kept the happy mood going for my boyfriend and I. The hobbit themed food was some of the best food I have ever had at Denny's. I wish they would bring most of it back!"}
{"text":"This place as accommodated big parties and small get togethers with friends. The food is cheap but tastes great. Service has been very good"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good!  I was pleasantly surprised with the good food, coffee, and very friendly service.  The sausage links were delicious!"}
{"text":"So this place is half empty and the wait to get settled is  20 mins and the food prep is over an hour. Plus there are several homeless people hanging around the front door."}
{"text":"Impossible to believe the changes in the quality of the food and service we had. I don't know if they have new management or we happened to hit the right night with the right cook, but our food was great! We had a new sever and she was pleasant, thoughtful and checked on us frequently. We went around midnight on Monday night so it was slower in there."}
{"text":"Denny's Denny's Denny's can't you see...sometimes your breakfast just hypnotizes me. This place is great. I am so glad they opened up a Denny's downtown because it is the ultimate go to place before heading over to the Eaton Center to get some shopping done. I usually get their big breakfast which includes, eggs, hashbrowns, 2 pancakes and 2 pieces of bacon. Although it isn't big portions they are very filling and their hashbrowns do hit the spot!  If Frans is full and you are near the downtown core, definitely pop by Dennys. The service is amazing as their waiters and waitresses are very attentive and make sure your tables are clean before sitting down at it. The only thing is you have to ask them for their Wifi Password and their arent outlets to fuel up your cellphone!"}
{"text":"The bf and I were staying off Fremont and wanted just a simple, familiar breakfast spot. We came in here around 930 am I want to say. Anyways as the hostess was taking us to our table, she proceed to put us in the way back next to a big party. We passed a both on the way back there and the bf asked if we could sit there instead, her reply was \"we came during a rush and we can't sit there cause the booth is for 4 people\". Granted we came in the morning but there was no rush of people, the place wasn't even crowded.. and secondly the other booths had 2 people in all of them, not sure what the big deal was.   When we got seated we had a really nice and punctual waitress, for the first half of our time there. Once we got our food, she pretty much disappeared. We had to ask other people to get us other things since she was no where to be found. The next time we saw her was when she gave us our bill.   The food was eh, most of our food was burnt. Which I get it, it's Denny's but cmon it wasn't even busy. And on top of that I had to wait for my food once my bfs meal came out. And all I ordered was  side dish. Someone screwed up in the kitchen.   Overall it was an ok experience, we didn't come back for breakfast though the rest of the time spent down there."}
{"text":"Charish was amazing. She was so attentive to me and my friend. I'll definitely be back just for her, five stars for Charish!"}
{"text":"We stopped in Medina, OH on our way home while on vacation. We went to Denny's for a breakfast we could count on, and we were absolutely delighted. As we walked in there were a couple of folks waiting to be seated and they were slammed at the register. Despite the chaos, the server spoke to each person who entered the restaurant as well as each that stepped-up to the register--making sure everyone knew they would be helped. We looked around as we waited and fell in love with the 50's style decor in red, white, black and chrome all around. The servers were super busy, but also mindful and very friendly. Once we were seated, we ordered coffee, the American Slam and the French Toast Slam--they came within 10 minutes of ordering and everything was as expected--tasty. As we were about to head to the register to pay our bill, the server asked us if we would like a coffee to go or anything else, which I found to be wonderfully accommodating, and we took her up on the offer for two coffees to go. We were all around happy with our experience with this Denny's and highly recommend the place!"}
{"text":"I am not normally a huge fan of Denny's but, they gave me FREE BREAKFAST YESTERDAY!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Ihop over Denny's any day.   Customer service: Two girls, not so energetic and welcoming is what you first run into. They sounded so dead and pointed at the table we were going to be seated. Out waiter was okay. Nobody actually bothered to come by and ask how our food was or do refills. Which is one of my biggest pet peeves when dining in any places. I also got hit by that stand they carry around to properly place their tray down. I didn't even get an apology from the lady. Literally just looked at me and looked away without saying anything.  Food: I ordered the French Toast Slam which was around $9 something. It obviously had a side of french toast, 2 bacons and 2 sausage links. I'm not a fan of sausage so I asked for it to be replaced with grilled ham. When my order came out, it was ridiculous. 2 eggs and ham with my french toast that hardly had any powdered sugar and butter. The amount of topping on my french toast was like small as a dime. I had to order bacon for $3 extra. Ridiculous. It should have came with my meal. I didn't even ask for no bacon.   Overall: This place is trash."}
{"text":"It's  1q3 outside. And it's warm inside this Dennys. Came in to cool off. Barely bearable in here."}
{"text":"Best late night food, comes here to get their T-bone,its great place to go if I don't want fast food. Staff are friendly and food never goes wrong for a franchise business."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Cali, had a party of 11 they where very accommodating. Super fast with the food, waitress was amazing. Great experience. Way better than any Denny's in California"}
{"text":"This place since new management has gone down hill fast.  It is in real need of a make over with seats torn, garbage in same spots for days, bathroom not as clean as should be, carpet dirty and wait staff not as sharp as need be.  Portions of food are small even for breakfast.  No comparison to Village Inn as far as food and service are concerned."}
{"text":"Just got back from breakfast.  Very nice staff and still getting out the kinks. Decor and set up nice--they aim to please and will continue to stay busy due to good locale"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here since they did renovations. The place looks really nice. Unfortunately when we walked in we had to wait but someone acknowledged us and sat us down. Once we were seated for about 15 minutes a waitress named Brenda came to our table and asked if we were being helped. I told her no and she apologized and said I will take your order. Then about 5 min later the waitress who was assigned to us , Olivia told us she would be right back smh. Thank goodness for Brenda saving the day because I was bout to walk out."}
{"text":"This Denny's is right in the heart of S. Scottsdale - perfect for patrons of the nightclubs afterwards.  Denny's doesn't have the best food in general, but after a night out full of shots, cocktails, & beer -- it sure hits the spot!  I don't condone eating this late, but if you're out on a night of fun with good company; just do it!  The waitresses here are pretty rambuntious; they sure know how to please and counteract with drunk crowd - I appreciate that!  I'm sure they deal with that crap on a weekly basis and are used to it.  Decor is your typical Denny's restaurant - you know that look :)"}
{"text":"Went here just for a bite.. got a horrible greeting by the waitress. I get she was swamped and my friends and I were perfectly fine with waiting, but what she greeted us with just caught me by surprise. We were sitting there waiting and she says \"so are y'all just gonna sit there, stand, or order take out?!\" Then proceeded to walk us to our table and sits us. Honestly, her greeting just didn't sit well. So we just left."}
{"text":"Ehhhh.    Pretty gross.    The eggs tasted like butter. Food came out cold.  Pancakes were blah.   Waste of 7 dollars.   Never again for cold food"}
{"text":"Food was alright like any other Denny's. We did get seated rather quickly. It just took forever for the food to come."}
{"text":"We just had a wonderful experience at this Denny's. The host was very kind, as was our waitress, Mandy. They took the Fried Cheese Melt off the menu but the waitress was able to have it made. There was some gum stuck to the booth and it got on the back of my pants. I mentioned it to the waitress and she brought over some ice so I could attempt to get the gum off.  She even offered to get it off for me. I was cleaning it off and the manager came over and apologized. He took 20% off our meal and gave us two more 20% off coupons. He said if I had to get the pants dry cleaned then they would cover the bill. It really wasn't a big deal but they were very nice about the whole thing. Anyway, the food was very good and the service was great. I will definitely be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is one of the Denny's in town you can count on. I ate at one whose bathroom was so filthy it felt gross to be eating there. Not here. Super clean bathrooms. Super nice wait staff. Good greasy-spoon diner. I love Denny's nachos!"}
{"text":"Denny's vs The Good Egg  Denny's wins every time, hands down.  I've tried so many of both restaurants around the Phoenix metro that I can say this without hesitation.    We've eaten at this Denny's many times and recommend it to our friends. They are the best option for a culinary experience you'll remember however they can cook an awesome breakfast.    They still offer their $2 ~ 2 eggs, choice of meat and pancakes or toast daily for the early birds.  They will cook anything to order and they will make corrections if needed quickly.   You can't go wrong with this Denny's especially when trying decide where to eat breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been waiting for over an hour for a cobb salad and an omelet.  If you're in a hurry during the week, I don't recommend this location.  They're HIGHLY UNDERSTAFFED."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. Table after table after table with dirty dishes on them which means short staff, The waitress was nice wrote everything down, I asked for Dr Pepper no ice I got a Coke with no ice. My daughter didn't get all of her order, neither did I. The food wasn't great at all. We told the waitress twice that we didn't like the food. I went to go pay for the bill, the manager asked how was the food was and I told her that we didn't like it and I told her that she could look at our plates and tell we that we didn't like the food and she gave me a 15 percent discount, she should have totally just written off the goddamn meal. My daughter spent most the time in the bathroom due to the food. I will not be coming back here. If I could give it a thumbs down I would."}
{"text":"This is the worse Denny's ever.  I came here before and the service too forever and I did not get a refill on my lemonade.  I wanted meatloaf and they were out.  I ordered online here and the store was closed.  The doors were open and I went inside. The server inside the store did not care about me ordering online.  I told him the online ordering should have been off.  I am getting a refund within 5 business days.  I talked to one store manager there named Anthony.  He apologized but did not offer anything to me for the inconvenience.  He was very uncaring and nor concern about this issue.  This place is bad for business."}
{"text":"Super clean Denny's. Coffee is always great and food comes out quick. Recommend their new jalape√±o honey bacon - bomb.com. Service is good, on top of it. Nice location and will be returning. Thank you"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible service. Was seated and was told  the waitress was going to come  take my order Was not given a glass of water no one even came to the table  fir 20 min .they were all standing at the front talking to the hostess and to top it off the place was nearly empty at midnight. I walked up to the hostess return the menus and explained why I was leaving and she basically shrugged her shoulders and said sorry and she didn't even attempt to call the waitress or have the issue remedied She just wanted to continue her conversation Terrible terrible service no service recovery very bad just want to grab a bite"}
{"text":"We used to eat here all the time, this was our go-to place after concerts or a late night.  I am not sure what has happened but the last two or three times we didn't even finish our food.  Our last trip here was awful.  There were no clean booths so one of the girls was asked to wipe one off for us, she shot over a dirty look, went over there wet the table down and that was it.  We were seated and it was wet and still had stuff on the table.  The menu items are also not as good as they used to be.  We placed or order and the same girl just threw it on the table like a child throwing a tantrum.  Then when food arrived it was awful.  Pile of melted butter in the middle that almost made me throw up.  My husband once again didn't finish his and we waited & waited for our check to the point of almost walking out without it.  We will never return, guess we need to find another 24 hour joint for after concerts."}
{"text":"What can I say.  I just wanted a nice breakfast. Nothing fancy.  Just two pieces of French toast. That's all. My boyfriend had a grand slam.  First nobody to seat us. Half the restaurant was air conditioned. It was 38 out.  Then we finally got s table. Things are starting to look up!!!  We ordered.  After 1/2 hour our food came out.  I got one piece of French toast.  She thought I meant I just wanted the bread cut in half.  That makes two.  I wonder what happens if you order 4.  Grand slam was fine.  The service really need help.  They were nice. Just clueless. My French toast was cold and hard. One piece of bread. Oh well. You have been warned!!!"}
{"text":"Gross.  Dirty.  Slow.  Sticky.  Overpriced.  Stinky.  Ew.   So sad I let people convince me to eat here."}
{"text":"I got the steak dinner and, the steak taste dry just like liver mash potato was OK the shrimp was totally full blown dry sauce taste terrible.yuk . The black guy waiter was great. The bread was well over dun along with ever thing else"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for YEARS now and it's one of those restaurants I can rely on when I feel like there is nothing else to eat.   Hey, I don't mind pancakes at night.   I like that whenever I come in, it's not very busy yet it's not quiet either. There's always a good group of people dining (in whatever hour during the weekday) and if your a regular, you would know what to expect and whose going to be serving you.   I like for the fact that their open 24/7... have free wifi... and caters EXCELLENT service. Of all the years I've been coming here... I can say that at least once or twice in the past years I've encountered some odd ball of a server. (Hey, it happens)  But other than that, the staff is always nice and available to modify your order to your liking or even suggest something for you (if you can't decide what to eat at all).  One thing I've noticed though, their sausages have become increasingly smaller compared to the sausages we had for the past years. So if your expecting a good sausage from your order.. take my advice and lower your expectations. That sausage is a certified small weiinnnerrrrrr.  Their pancakes though, is OKAY. I've tasted better and I eat one sometimes just for the sake of the taste. I like their syrup though.  Anyway, I like how their menu expanded now since they offer new varieties to choose from...especially the \"fit fare menu\" has expanded a little bit if your health conscious. Am assuming their menu will be always change from time but I look forward to it nonetheless.   Price wise is inexpensive... ranges from approx $5.99 to $15. Depends on what you get too. Am always full when I leave this place.. it's worth the money in my opinion.  Overall, do visit this location. Whether you just got out of work, got out of the club, or just plain hungry (because there's nothing to eat at home)... they can sure fill your belly needs."}
{"text":"Poppa had a hankering for some breakfast so he took us to the new Denny's in our hood. Walked in around 3:30pm and the place was ours. We were seated and greeted by the best server we have had since, ever.  She was super friendly and took really good care of us. She helped us get the most for our money because mini me is a tricky eater.  For starters we ordered the pancake donut hole things or otherwise known as sweet fried balls of goodness that were topped with powdered sugar and came with a side of this cream cheesy/frosting dipping sauce...Can I get a witness!?! Mini me got a ton of food-french toast, sausage and hash browns. Poppa got the white chocolate raspberry topped pancake smorgasbord with hash browns and other goodness. I got the club sandwich and and fries which was oh so mmm yummy.  Let me tell you all of our food was made with so much love it was a 10 on the it was good it was Stupid Meter. Our mouths were happy and thankful! Between the service and the food, we were just sure that this Denny's oozes love in the form of food and staff. Well played people, well played.  PS. Our server was Karen, can this girl get a raise?"}
{"text":"Ok so like growing up Denny's was the spot especially for the church folk and that is how I was raised until about 13, anyway this spot had it all and once when I was on a road trip with my Dad,stepmom and little brother all we did was eat a Denny's from Ca to the ATL that and the occaisional Waffle house. But somehow I stopped going to Denny's and now they have changed and this is for the better. They have brought back the free breakfast grand slam and they have menu options in $2, $4, $6, and $8 options plus their faithful standbys. I am talking about the Super Bird people the best sandwich for the last 4 decades.  Anyway in this economy sometimes you want to just chill out and talk to your friends and Denny's has always been that and so much more for me. Reunited and it feels so good."}
{"text":"I went here with my co-worker while on business. It was a  snowy night so we were literally the only people inside. The waitress was nice. She brought us our food fast and she even told me she gave me extra bacon, woo hoo......  So I tried this bacon, and it was weird. I told my coworker to have some and we both decided it tasted like what a dog bacon flavored treat would taste like. The other food was fine, the chocolate milk was AMAZING. It was cheap of course."}
{"text":"Great chain restaurant definitely a five-star at this location, service is always great, food is always hot, and it actually has flavor like it supposed to, from hamburgers to Mexican food fajitas no matter what we order breakfast it always taste like it supposed to I believe Jenny spares no expense to keep their clients satisfied.."}
{"text":"Denny's is a all American favorite.  The menu has delicious choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, desert, or just to have a cold fountain drink.   We've been patrons of many different Denny's for YEARS now.  We love the menu and the prices.   This Denny's is warm and inviting.  The staff is great.  Bernadette was our waitress and we loved her service.  She is very attentive, smiling and making you feel welcome.   Bernadette recommended the Avocado Chicken Caesar and it is YUM!!!  It's a really healthy, hardy salad that is perfect to eat when the heat digits outside are just too high:)"}
{"text":"Great place to go for breakfast, specially with kids. We all got the Denny's special cups for drink as souvenir :)) everbody enjoyed their plates, we got pancakes, ommelettes."}
{"text":"If you have patience and have no other option around Mirage for your food, this is just an OK place. But I recommend trying to find the better place. We stayed in Mirage and this was the perfect location as it is just 5 minutes walk across the street. So we decided to get a breakfast here. We ordered for carrying out since it was a very cold winter morning. After we got our food back to the hotel, we saw that there were more than 3 items missing. Not one not two but three which pretty much says how good they are with their orders. We had to call them and it sounded very normal to them and they did not even feel like they made a huge mistake. We ended up being hungry as we did not have a complete order. Next day we went there so we can get our breakfast that they messed up back as we had already paid for it, they without giving hard time gave us the food. If you are ordering for carry out, just double check on the restaurant no matter how many items you have."}
{"text":"Please hire something other than teeny boppers. I don't appreciate the lack of acknowledgement because these girls want to talk ONLY to my husband.  So what??? You don't think I don't know how to order some food lady? I need my man to do it? No. Just No. The food was nothing special. It's basic Denny's food. And I loved how they come to ask if we are enjoying our meal as we had just shoved a mouthful of food in there. Nice timing."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about coming to this location of Denny's but I'm glad that I did. The breakfast was perfect there are many items to choose from but then I noticed the 55+ menu with healthy choices so I ordered the egg white omelet with veggies and cheese. I replaced English muffin with rye toast and it came with a generous bowl of fruit. The server Mo made sure we had what we needed and I will be back during our stay here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've received.... We waited a long time to be seated, I understand they were understaffed. There's was only 2 servers and 2 cooks to me that's short staffed & wasn't even that busy I don't know if the cooks are slow or the servers are slow. I waited about a good 20min for drinks and another 20-25min for food to arrive. Both servers kept forgetting about my drinks and my marinara sauce. I blame the manager, he was just standing there like he had nothing to do, Denny's needs to work on this specific location.  If you notice the rest of the reviews I'm not the only one, it's not me being a dick it's me saving people's time.  I will probably never come here again."}
{"text":"This Denny's was swamped when we went in there at 9am on Saturday morning. We had a party of two so we were sat rather quickly. It was a 15 minute wait, our food came out hot and fast, and our waitress was on top of everything!"}
{"text":"Across from Diablos Cantina at the Monte Carlo, Denny's has always been a go to place for most locals, and tourists like myself who never get a chance to eat at DENNY'S up here in Toronto. The food is always safe, not necessarily MIND BLASTING, OVER THE TOP! however if all else fails, you can count on Denny's.   Our server for the most part was very polite, and helpful when it came to decision making on the menu.    I had their bacon burger with onion rings: 3/5, tasty, but nothing to rave over.  I think they ripped me off on the onion rings though. lol"}
{"text":"The food was OK, but the wait was horrendous!  I was seated right away, was served coffee and water, my order was taken, and THIRTY minutes later the food arrived. There were three other tables near me who were there when I arrived, and their service was just as slow. The young lady at the front was just short of rude when I went to pay my bill. I should have saved myself the frustration and gotten a fast food meal. Don't bother going here! The coffee, by the way, was so hot I had to add ice to it before I could drink it!!"}
{"text":"I love this Denny's I used to come here all the time they are so convenient on Fremont. I wanna send a shout out to Pedron. I'll never forget the ample service he provided and his dedication as a waiter I miss him"}
{"text":"Denny's is a favorite place of ours throughout North America since the food is usually consistently good and very inexpensive (the US more so than Canada). This is a new location that (I believe) was relocated from down the street just east of Torbram. The place looks great and the service was super friendly. Food was also very good, as usual."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, accurate every time.  The service is amazing. We get it to go and it's still good when I get it home.  Great idea for anyone caring for someone or caregivers. It's a inexpensive switch up and when you order it correctly, it can be healthy! If you dine in ask for Blue, you will be well taken care of!"}
{"text":"There was this really nice server there. I don't remember his name but he's like the most respectful and attentive server I have ever had at Denny's. It was awesome! I think this Denny's is better than most Denny's in terms of atmosphere since I think most Denny's are terrible. Food was ok. I had the grand slam but it was nothing special. I really don't know why people don't go to other pure breakfast places to eat breakfast food that's better tasting. But then again, good breakfast places usually close around 2pm. LOL,"}
{"text":"We call this Gay Denny's or Jenny's.   It's really like any other Denny's. There's no reason for you to drive to this one because it makes more sense to go to the one in your neighborhood. Usually, we go to this one when there's an event in Downtown Phoenix. It's nearby.  Other reasons that I go? My friends are poor and Denny's open late. Otherwise, you should never eat at Denny's."}
{"text":"I am only giving this a three for the food, if I had to rate it on cleanliness, it would get a 1 barely. It was 4:30 am, the parking lot had trash all over...but ok, its dark, maybe a lil breezy, so I can let that go...however....the first thing I see when we walk in is trash on the floor, then as we are getting seated...more trash on the floor, some food, straw wrapper etc...then after taking my seat, more food of some sort on the floor by my feet... Now really? It is 4:30 in the morning. We are the only people in the place, and they don't have time to clean the trash off the floor? Oh, how about the 3 tables that haven't been cleaned off..? They don't have time to clean those? The food looked good and tasted ok, however the multiple trips to the bathroom later weren't fun. Since hubby and I ate completely different things, I'm guessing their soda fountain wad dirty...Not someplace I will be going again."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's EVER and i don't expect much from this place to begin with.  Never ever return or go here....."}
{"text":"Ordered the nachos and they put paper under them on the plate... so all the liquid from the microwaved ground beef made bits of paper in the food.... my son's pizza was obviously tossed in a microwave and burned... my chicken wrap was also microved with lettuce in it... who microwaves lettuce? The service was not bad but not notable. I will never eat at this Dennys again. I think the only part of the meal that wasn't absolutely horrible was my daughters grapes, but they just had to put them in a bowl. Who is working In the kitchen? That was really bad."}
{"text":"Clean, good service and the food was delicious. Tried the new Banana Pancakes. This was my first time and hopefully not the last one."}
{"text":"4 stars. The burgers are big and tasty. The meat is real and if it's frozen it doesn't taste like it.  Prices are right on reasonable and add-ones are cheap too.  The ladies here are really nice. A few have been here over 15 yrs.  this Denny's has changed our minds about Denny's.   Very happy to see Denny's start competing with other restaurants. We are fans now."}
{"text":"Silverware was brought to us AFTER our food was already at the table in our corner booth in the back with dirty carpets surrounding us. Kids waited over 20 minutes for their juices.  The waitstaff sure acted like they didn't want to be there that day. Make sure if you visit for \"Kids eat free\" on Tuesdays that you mention it BEFORE ordering! And I didn't appreciate the way the waitress AND manager repeated that \"they didn't ask for it\" in front of me. Usually when I enter an eatery, they tell me what promos are going on and automatically apply... not making me feel like it's my fault for asking for a promotion after the bill is presented. Am I just old school when it comes to Denny's?!  If I had a kitchen at my hotel room, I would have cooked eggs and bacon myself!  Disappointed in the overall experience. I almost didn't tip.. but as a former server, I shall never do that to a working individual. We will not visit again when we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I went here the other night for an ice cream sundae with hot fudge and caramel sauce on it. I was disappointed that the hot fudge was overly sweet and gritty, like it was made from a powder mix that wasn't mixed enough.   The service was good, as was the remainder of my sundae."}
{"text":"no so great, staff was kind but orders took to long to be deliverd i ask for a cesar salad and chicken feeel like not really fresh, bathroom very pretty clean"}
{"text":"Ryder is always providing exceptional service. Definitely have him make ya a milkshake some time. 10/10 will visit again because the staff is awesome and always serve with a smile! Tell ya friends!"}
{"text":"I don't like the design. It's not a place you feel welcome or a warm place. Hostesses not friendly. Employees stand by entrance and smoke on their brakes. I went in ordered coffee and hotcakes, server asked if I wanted anything else I said after I  eat hotcakes.  For some reason on LV strip they do not make hotcakes fresh. The plate was very hot but not the cakes. Server brought new cakes overdone but never removed the 1st plate. Each time I asked for a refill I got a new cup. That's absurd. Waste of coffee and water to wash.  Server never asked if I wanted anything else.  Upon arrival I  waited  8 minutes. The hostess took cash while making me wait. These people walked up after I  waited 8 minutes. When paying my bill she asked \" how was every th hing?\" I said hotcakes were cold. She never said one word.   DENNYS YOU HAVE LOST THE TOUCH."}
{"text":"In the last 6 weeks been to this location 5+ times and every time had an issue. Too long to get server, incorrect or missing food items. Managers are not trained with customer service. I had quesadia that the cheese was cold not melted. Sent it back. Cook microwaved it. The cheese was stuck to plate. Asked manager \"would you eat this, he said yes.  I ordered slice of pumpkin pie and sundae. Waitress put sudae over my pie and added puts not pecan. Manager did nothing to correct."}
{"text":"The worst Denny's I've ever been too. It took forever to be seated. Once we were seated we were left high and dry waiting for our server. All the customers seating by us seemed to have the same issues. The staff seemed stressed out and understaffed. The on shift manager seemed completely oblivious to the situation. WE WALKED OUT LIKE MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS...."}
{"text":"Coffee was warm and no creamer was brought until the meal was almost over. The eggs were instant. The only positive was the waitress was very sweet. I give my visit 3 stars just for her"}
{"text":"I have never had his horrible of service.  I placed my order last night at 645, it said my order would be ready by 709 pm.  I showed up at 720 and it wasn't done. They said it wasn't started yet, and wouldn't be ready for another hour and a half to TWO HOURS since they were busy.  I told them I just wanted to cancel the order, it wasn't that important it's just food whatever. The guy at the register told me I was going to have to print out my online order receipt and bring it back a different day to be refunded because they were too busy to refund me then.  He sent the manager out to speak with me and she was very kind and said she'd just make my order then.  She came back a few minutes later with my order, and when I got it home it was wrong. Almost everything in the order was completely wrong.  Never eating at this location again."}
{"text":"Unable to give less than one star. 15 minutes to be noticed for a table. Then 15 minutes to be seated. Another 10 minutes for coffee. 45 minutes later...still no food. I will be back to write review if we ever do get food."}
{"text":"When you're drunk as hell and trying to maintain your budget, nothing beats this particular Denny's.  Seriously, it's at a really prime location on the strip and it's open 24 hours a day. What else can you ask for??  However, I don't think i would eat here if i were sober. haha."}
{"text":"July 2016 Last few times we have stopped in, we have been very disappointed with service and overall cleanliness of this Denny's. Last night, the floor was sticky, many people were having issues with their orders, the bathrooms were a hot mess, and many tables were left messy. When we were first seated, we were asked 3 times (from 3 different servers) what we wanted to drink- yet it still took 10 minutes to get them (2 diet cokes!). We had to ask for menus, and when our food came, had to ask for silverware as well. I hope this isn't the new \"norm\" at this favored quick stop for us."}
{"text":"To steal from another, this place is so hit or miss. If they are the slightest bit busy go elsewhere. My sons daycare is very close to this location and I stop to grab something a lot and the wifi is good. They are so understaffed and if all the employees don't pitch in you will get zero drink refills. It would not be so bad but the guy working today 27 May for breakfast just stood there and shuffled menus while the waitress struggled. Zero complaints about the food but I also order the same thing every time Santa Fe skillet."}
{"text":"Every time we come we ask for Mandy C. She is always a bright spot in our day! We always go to this location because of her!!! So many restaurants to choose from but the service makes a difference!!!"}
{"text":"Came to eat here around 10pm.... Booth filthy... Good milkshakes but found hair in pancakes .... None of the cooks had hairnets .... Staff clueless too ... Will not be back"}
{"text":"They have big servings and tasty food. The price isn't low but the big servings make it worth it. * Try their red velvet bites (or whatever you call it) get them with ice cream."}
{"text":"I liked it kinda....the service was great the food good. But what you got for the money you paid was lacking. Might go back if I had a coupon."}
{"text":"We like to go to this Denny's on occasion, but we have visited this location twice in the past 3 weeks.  I have to give a call out to the Shift Supervisor, her name is Sandi.  She was so good, the place was slammed and she was still very attentive to the customers.  Spent time talking to us and making recommendations of what she thought was great on the menu.  I actually took her recommendation and had the meatloaf.  It was yummy.   Because of Sandi, this will be our Denny's of choice."}
{"text":"Had to walk out again with no one to acknowledge me after I sat down.   Sit at the counter,  be invisible.   I did hear one waitress tell another she was going to smoke and didn't care how full her section was.   This is consistent with all of the previous reviews.   A clear culture of \"we don't care\"."}
{"text":"The wait was kind of long but the food was good and the server was really friendly. It's a classic diner and a good place to bring your family and kids."}
{"text":"I had breakfast for dinner today!  I've been going here for several years now.  I still remembered when they closed it down and boarded it up.........then several weeks later it was back open again.  Made me think I was in the twilight zone.  Today I just had the basic eggs sausage and bacon today.  It would be pretty hard to mess this up.  It was only two servers working and the cook and it wasn't that busy at all.  I took my father and he had the steak and eggs and it looked pretty good as well.  The server came and checked on us several times and it honestly was a good experience."}
{"text":"Let's be honest here, this is a Denny's. You know why you're here. Either you're here because it was convenient or it's after 2AM and you're flat wasted or getting over and you need some grubbing. With that being said, you already know what this place is about. You are not expecting Ritz Carlton appearance, service, and price.   This is the place off the freeway at I-17 and Thomas.   We came out of the nearby strip club Jaguar's around 2AM since they stopped serving booze. We were hungry.   Food was Denny's quality. It's edible and exactly what you wanted. Do not expect the steak to be anything other than line cooked steak. However, at this point in time, I don't quite remember what I ordered given the situation but I can assure you it was delicious and fitting of sobering up.   The place looks like a Denny's, of course.  The lot fits a bunch of people but it's partially a shared lot with the hotel next door.   Bathrooms are relatively clean.   Prices are below $10 typically. Portions are reasonable. There are things above $10 though such as steak, etc.   I've been here a lot...of course I'm going to come here again. For everyone else, this place will do decently."}
{"text":"Ms. Snookie took great care of me as I took my mind off the $1200 car repair that I was having done. The food was ok but the service was 5 stars in itself. I mean it's Denny's. What can you expect? My eggs and bacon were cooked just the I wanted, the coffee was a little bland but hey, whatever. It was kind of dark in there for a bright Saturday Morning/Afternoon which I thought was odd and the bathroom needed some attention but all in all not too bad. I may come back if I am ever in the area waiting on yet another car repair."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a long drawn out meal... We ordered breakfast for dinner, the French toast came out followed by a plate of eggs with bacon, after that came the hash browns and that was just my hubby's dinner... Next came my pancakes, a few minutes later came the eggs with hash browns, a few more minutes came the bacon. Not to mention that it took forever to get the coffee.  Our waitress was fairly new, I don't understand that the cook could not plate a complete meal at one time for the server to bring to the table rather than having multiple plates, at various times.  We are debating on EVER coming back!"}
{"text":"Until recently, I've only had the take-out from this Denny's. I was craving breakfast food yesterday and insisted to my boyfriend that we're making a trip to Denny's. He said he wasn't going to order anything, but that didnt stop me from going. I'll stuff my face in front of a guy-- no big deal!   So we go there and the hostess greets us and opens the door. We are seated in a booth, and our server comes about 1-2 minutes later. His name was Bobby. What a coincidence!   So, my Bobby couldn't decide what shake he wanted and asked for suggestions. Server Bobby showed us the list of new shakes and suggested the Strawberry Cheesecake (which sounded mouth-watering!!) It was delivered and of course we also received the infamous over-flow which is literally half of a glass! So my Bobby enjoyed his shake and I ate the over-flow :x   I chose the French Toast Breakfast which comes with 2 pieces of french toast w/ powdered sugar, 2 eggs any style, 2 pieces of sausage/bacon, and hash brown. It was definitely delicious and filling, but I'm not sure why the hash brown showed up in a weird shape, as if they were in a container waiting all day for me to order and then microwaved them.. I'm not sure, but they were good. Just weird how hash browns kept their container shape..? This was also on the 2,4,6,8, Value Menu ($6)  Bobby ordered the Gram Slammich which came with hash browns & looked great to me! He also ordered a side of sausage, biscuits, & gravy with egg ($2) He was too full to finish half of his sandwhich, but also stated that the bread tasted like maple syrup. I don't know how that would be a bad thing.. i think he just didnt want me to make a big deal about him not finishing it, haha.   Denny's is seriously an awesome deal. I mean, come on, what other restaurant besides fast food has a $2 menu? NO ONE! such great food and value for your dollar! Plus, my bobby is anti EnP after having 5 bad experiences, so Denny's is the winner in our book :)  I went in for breakfast (at dinner time) but almost changed my mind due to their awesome menu! Overall, good food, good service, great time! :)"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast the other morning and got right in. The place looks like it might have been remodeled(?) when me and my husband went to sit in the booth our knees were smashed into each other that we could not sit across from each other. The food was not as good as it usually is, but that won't stop us from going back. We will just have to sit at a table. The waitress was really nice and service was fast."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner on a Sunday mid afternoon. And after we got seated everything went downhill the sodas were nasty, the waitress got my order completely wrong, they shorted the hubby on bacon and sausage I asked for a cake to go and never got that. The only thing the manager would say was I am sorry she didn't put the order in right. Although I guess it was nice that he gave us $5.00 off.  We have had good service there so I suppose it's who you get as a server."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! 50 mins for a burger and fries ... seriously?? There was only 4 people in the restaurant it was a very slow day.. I also have a 2 year old that was hungry and crying because the food took so long. I really wanted to leave and go to mcdonalds that's how bad I felt for my child and I regret not leaving. The waiter came to our table twice out of the 50 mins we sat there which is ridiculous !!! She Didn't ask for refills didn't tell us what was going on with it food nothing. All our waitress did was took our orders and gave us our drinks. She didn't bring the food to the table and that's because the manager came up and asked how everything was going I told him I've been waiting forever for my food and me and my child are  starving. That didn't make it go by any faster he didn't really apologize he just said there was a burner down in the kitchen... when I finally received my burger that just came out the kitchen my bottom bun was soggy from how greasy the burger was.. I was so hungry I just ate it even though it was absolutely disgusting . I don't recommend you get the seasoned fries they charge extra for they aren't worth it at all. Also it took us forever to get the check because our waitress never returned to the table so I had to get up and track the manager down to get the check. NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"The smell of dirt and mold when you walk through the doors pretty much a turn off, but now I know it's from a dirty old mop, pancakes were disgusting they smelled it tasted like the old mop, there was nobody in there but me and another lady and all I heard was in talk about how miserable they were ,  wasn't enjoyable at all don't come back, The only plus was the hostess the blond girl at the front she seem like she was the only one who cared so sad, it was another lady Mexican lady with a lot of make up on this was kind of sad she just didn't care if there was food on the table for 18 hours they said, anyways won't be back food sucked smells like mold stay away go to Jack-in-the-Box"}
{"text":"Just had a nice \"catch up\" with Leslie Hicks Yanko. Always glad to see her. Had a nice chat and a delicious breakfast to boot!  Eggs, bacon, sausage and hash browns cooked to perfection. Coffee always kept hot. Had a huge glass of OJ (though I admit it seemed a bit watered down -- the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars). And I have two of their new light and fluffy pancakes for breakfast tomorrow as I couldn't finish it all.  I know a lot of folks aren't always on board with chain restaurants/diners, breakfast is always a good deal here!  From the reviews from several months ago it appears to have had some serious changes wait staff was prompt and food came out quickly though there were only a handful of folks there. There also was a group in their private dining for a business meeting of some sort. Everyone has off days. Maybe it's turned around."}
{"text":"I go to Denny's several times a year for a quick breakfast. It is always good. Price is right. Plus they give AARP discount. I am. Ever disappointed. Waitstaff is efficient and friendly. Serving portions are good and their new pancake recipe is to die for!  Huge and fluffy. I can only actually eat one."}
{"text":"Saturday's is chaos here. Lots of servers mostly serving big groups. I think the attention on the big groups hurts the individual or couples dining here. I get it is a tough job, mostly thankless.  I'm just sharing my experience here on a Saturday morning around 9a and rating it accordingly based on below points, but taking into account the effort of bus boy. -10 minutes to put in drink order.  -Another 8 minutes to put in food order. (Please give me coffee! ) -5 minutes after the cup of coffee arrives, still missing the shake. (Lord, help me remain graceful. ) -8 more minutes and shake arrives and its wrong flavor. (I am  but I choose to forgive.) -12 minutes later and food arrives. (I'm thinking at this point that I should have just made breakfast at home.)  From being seated to finally eating that is just a long wait for mediocre food. The whole time it was the bus boy taking care of our table. Poor guy. He did the best he could.  Overall, busy place on weekend mornings. Servers are very nice and try their best. It just gets hectic and the service quality will suffer, especially if you expect being checked on continuously or expect your drinks refreshed without trying to flag down your server. Food is okay and priced accordingly to the quality.  This is Denny's. Keep that in mind and you won't be too disappointed.  PS- I tipped the bus boy (Ron) well. I appreciate his work ethic and willingness to help his servers. And he did it without looking stressed or unhappy. I made sure to tell him and say thanks despite my state of mind pre-coffee."}
{"text":"Worst place ever visited ! We visit Denny's in the US and they are so good but this store in Canada was disappointing ! Tasteless steak with petite portions . Cheddar mashed potatoes were tasting of coconut . Horrible !!! Sirloin steak was horrible , I ordered medium rare ... I don't think the cooks are trained to make steaks at perfection , it's an art to grill steaks . Portion sizes were like kids meals with dried n dead veggies !  I am shocked !!!"}
{"text":"This is a Denny's and you get what you expect here, its standard breakfast stuff and it is well prepared. I will say that on Sunday this place is packed but they did their best to accommodate out large party of 10 in only 15-20 min even when they had said it would take around 45.  The kitchen was a little far behind but they got our food to us, still warm and tasty. The coffee was refilled multiple times and the staff was as quick as they could be while so busy."}
{"text":"This restaurant has given me one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. It was my birthday and we went in to this Denny's for dinner. They started by seating us, then ignoring us for 40 min. We eventually asked for drinks and were told \"in a minute\" and they still didn't come for over 15 min more.  Then they told us that they seated us at the wrong table. For this error on their part we were treated extremely rudely the remainder of our visit.   We asked if we had a waiter and to speak to the manager, because everyone around us was getting service and we were being ignored. We were told \"He is the Night Shift Manager\".  They finally brought water and it had no ice and was disgusting tasting. The pancakes we received were the worst I've ever had, and were topped with rotten bananas. The hamburgers were cold, the fries were cold, and the avocado was hard. I actually ate my pancakes even though the bananas were rotten.   I Complained to the manager and he snatched the hamburger right out of my daughters hand, while she was holding it, even after telling him she didn't want it recooked, and then he told us to \"Get out!\"  Denny's used to be one of my favorite restaurants. Certainly not anymore."}
{"text":"We came in with a large group and got sat at 2 tables. The first table got their drinks and food within 10minutes of ordering. We waited for at least 20 minutes after they got theirs. Our other table finished and got up before we were even served. One of the people in our group didn't get her salad until 5 minutes after we were served as well."}
{"text":"so i went after clubbing and gambling and they assumed we were drunk first off. NO. i was not drunk please dont give me a kid sized water. because 1 im thirsty, its hot, 2 thats prejudice, 3 if i notice everyone has full sized adult drinks, im angry.  the food here is blah, but it is dennys but it should at least be  alittle good i mean its murdered in cheese so thats like a given, but it just wasnt that good. maybe i did need to be drunk to enjoy it. JUST MAYBE. service was sub par. i had to ask for a refill on my literally 4oz cup of water. seriously?"}
{"text":"My favorite Denny's!!! The latest additions to their menu--the Smokey Gouda Chicken & Broccoli Skillet is EXCELLENT!!! Made exactly to my requests (when the right cook is there!) this is a perfect meal! The Kale Side salad is PERFECTION!!! Please don't stop offering this delicious salad--EVER!!! The quality is SUPERB!!! The waitstaff are very nice, efficient and courteous people! In particular--Charity is our favorite--always smiling--what a sweet gal--she's the best!! Love our Greentree Denny's!"}
{"text":"Years ago this place was great for the late night experience. For that fact and that fact alone, I gave it two stars. Today I went with my wife and we sat in our booth, on the end of half full dining room. In this booth we sat without drinks for 15+ minutes. Finally, our drink order was taken. While we waited for our food I decided to visit the restroom. Walking in there, I felt there was a risk of contracting Hepatitis. No amount of soap will ever make me feel clean again.   I will NEVER return to this place. No amount of good memory's from my youth, will persuade me to return there. It is becoming more and more run down and decrepit.   Save your money and your time, and go to a different Denny's. The 7th St and Camelback location should be shut down and renovated IMMEDIATELY!! Reopen it only after a proper diner can be made of this travesty, and a management can be found, who will keep it as such."}
{"text":"I've only been to a few different Denny's locations but I don't know why this place is only three stars because the food is absolutely AMAZING.   I ordered a custom grand slam: egg whites, sausage links, hash browns and an english muffin. Boy was I in for a treat! The egg whites were delicious and perfectly done - I woofed it down. The sausage links were nice and juicy. The english muffin was warm, well toasted and a tad buttery but I'll allow it because the dish was so delicious. The hash browns were absolutely STUNNING. They were perfect. Absolutely perfect. I add ketchup to mine so I'm not sure how it tastes without ketchup but BOY OH BOY I WOULD ORDER THIS CUSTOM GRAND SLAM AGAIN AND AGAIN AT THIS LOCATION ONLY. They blew the basics of breakfast out of the water. The hash browns were woofed down alongside the eggs, in fact, I literally swallowed the entire dish whole.   Their grand slams are a MUST. I'm itching to return to this Denny's and this location ALONE. It's attached to a hotel which threw my boyfriend and I off at first when we parked (for free mind you) but the food quickly made us change our minds.  The place was nice and cozy, it's more spacious than one would think from the exterior. The waiters were straight to the point and efficient - perfect for those early morning drop-ins prior or post sleep.   I'm 100% returning to this location.  EDIT: I returned to this location 2 more times since and the waiters and waitresses were lovely as per usual. However, the food quality had diminished since my first visit. Perhaps the chef is different from my 1st visit at 2 AM in contrast to my last 2 visits at 11 PM-1 AM."}
{"text":"So this Denny's on Fremont is a mess late nights.   We were not greeted when we walked in, it took way too long to be seated.  It seems that most the servers had been partying, some seem wired etc.  Several times I had to ask for a side of the same sauce, twice she brought the wrong drink..  Then waitress openly tells us \"oops, you can tell I drink\" what the what?!?  Food was ok but rushed and looked messy.  I will only eat at this Denny's again if I'm more drunk then I was last time.  Great spot for cheap drinks (reason for 2nd star)"}
{"text":"The kind of food you expect from a Denny's. Our server was really nice and timely. The Super Bird was not very good. My banana whipped cream pancakes were great. The nachos come in a very large serving so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to leave one star. This is the worst place I have eaten at. My spoon had food on it then when they brought me a new set the fork had food on it. The bathroom was so bad that I couldn't use it so I held it till I got to a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I went back late at night and my server Sheree was a delight and I tipped her well. The service was better."}
{"text":"Visited this place because they were offering Build Your Own Grand Slam for free on your birthday. It is very nice of them. My husband has a birthday today and we took a long drive to find Denny's. There really has not much Denny's around, none in GTA area.  When we went there, there were not much customers, 3 other tables, but the service was suuuuuper slow, even with many employees walking around chatting, not really serving. Our server is a nice young lady, but she is often hiding in the kitchen, hard to find her.  It is not our first time to go to Denny's. We have been to Niagara Falls and Mississauga Denny's many times and had great time with satisfying food, but unfortunately not this one. The food quality is good, but portion size are very small, like a kids meal. The coffee taste like plain hot water, definitely will not wake you up. Maybe that's why they can offer free refill.   If I really need to go to Denny's again, will not go to this location again, will try other locations or go to Mississauga or Niagara Falls location."}
{"text":"Bad service took more than an hour to get our food not only that our food was incomplete just horrible"}
{"text":"Always excellent service here.  The food is good.  Same as any Denny's but I've never had a bad meal.  I like that their menu changes regularly."}
{"text":"Our first visit of a Denny's restaurant. The ambience was nice especially the cosy seating furniture. We were seated by a friendly employee and chose a steak skewer skillet and a club sandwich. Both the club sandwich and the skillet looked very nice and were very tasty. The service staff was very fast, polite and caring. Well done. During the rest of our trip through the USA we will visit Denny's again."}
{"text":"Had an awesome time at Dennys yesterday. Their menu is pretty extensive but always includes new limited edition items like the independence day grand slam which was absolutely delicious. This is the kind of place where everyone in your party will find something they like in the menu. Our server was on the ball and was super nice and efficient. All of us really enjoyed our meals and we were impressed that food made at midnight didn't taste awful or look less than appetizing. I never really ventured into Dennys before but I most certainly will come back and be a loyal customer!! I love their pancakes!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this denny¬¥s.  Always fast and friendly smiles though it was packed.i didnt have to wait long.we were a big party and they served us quick."}
{"text":"I have went to this location a couple times a month with my boyfriend. We continuously get bad service . They asked us to move our vehicle , and my boyfriend kindly said okay we're almost done eating well be right on our way. the manager came up to us and said no move it now or we'll call the cops . Se was extremely rude to us and my bf said she was being rude . The manager went on to tell the people my boyfriend used to work with .  Which made him loose his job cause she said he was rude to her. He was not even in uniform as well as she had no right to tell other people our problems . But yes I will no longer be going here . We like ihop better anyways ."}
{"text":"This is the worst Dennys in Northeast Ohio! Terrible service.I had a complaint about the food and the server said that's how it's supposed to be. Always only one server when I go at night. Try Mentor or Kirtland (Willoughby) Dennys for better service."}
{"text":"We waited so long to be seated that we joked that we were invisible ghosts to the staff. We ordered, and our food was brought out many minutes later. My pancakes, bacon, eggs, and hash browns tasted good. My husband's toast was burned--twice. He sent the burnt toast back, and they brought him out more burnt toast. His bacon and eggs were cooked fine. The waitress was nice."}
{"text":"The food service was fast, the food was hot.  Problem was the table was sticky and the poutine does not look or taste like a poutine.  It tasted like mac n cheese crossed with nacho cheese sauce.  It was made with potato home fries rather than French fries or the supposed wavy fries advertised in menu.  The server didn't even comment on it.  So that must be their regular poutine.  Ice cream sundae, ice cream was crystallized.  I'm hoping this was a one-off experience"}
{"text":"hands down the best Denny's I have ever been to. Staff is amazing. on my most recent visit my server Jen was super friendly. my wife ordered banana french toast, and they were out of bananas. Jen went notified her manager Kyle. he came over apologized, asked us if it would be okay for us to wait a few minutes. he went to the store and bought bananas. We were absolutely blown away with the service. the food quality a Denny's is definitely progressed. The store is very clean. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I ordered a root beer and then the waitress disappeared completely. A different waitress appeared approximately 25 minutes later and apologized for the long wait, then proceeded to take my order. After what seemed like an eternity, my chicken fried steak appeared in front of me. The eggs were soggy and the hashbrowns were burnt. I finished my drink and got a refill, but when I sipped the freshly refilled beverage I realized it was Dr. Pepper and not root beer. I forgot to mention the entire facility smelled of cat urine. I would say this restaurant has set the bar for which all other Denny's should be measured and it is worth noting that I will be returning here again for the outstanding experience."}
{"text":"Since this location is right down the street from our house we decided to give it a fair chance. For that reason we went there 4 different times. We had horrible service and all of our food was cold every time. We could not get refills either since our server would just disappear. The last time that we went there we had our server \"go on break\" we had to go to the counter to get a check and their response was thanks but sorry he didn't check on you. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Went to go have a Philly cheesesteak sandwich.  Got seated and it took 40 minutes to get my sandwich.  Having to wait wasnt the bad part, seeing the sandwich they brought me was.  The sandwich was about 90 percent vegetables and cheese.  I was really disappointed with not just the quality of the food, but also the quality of the service.  Here what was important was the fact the resturant was making money, and not taking care of its customers.  The manager didn't seem to care my order wasn't made properly, and did nothing to fix my order.  Last time this place ever gets my business."}
{"text":"Denny's is a great chain for breakfast and this location does not disappoint.   I've always been a fan of Denny's for breakfast or brunch. They have a ton of options allowing you to order almost anything you could want. If you're not sure what to go for, I'm a big fan of their pancakes and their omelettes. Both are served to you in huge portions, so there's no way you'll be leaving hungry. This location also has great service and will keep your coffee cup full.   Good food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The one and only reason we come to this location is because of a server and his name is Reno. What a funny guy! He is such a pleasure to do business with and we will keep coming here until he goes elsewhere. Good job picking that one Denny's and your new pancakes a fucking amazing. Keep that shit up!"}
{"text":"Better than most of the casino buffets. We came here twice for breakfast on our trip. First time was awesome. Our waitress made all the difference. Second time was mediocre at best.  Wait time mid-morning was 25 minutes. Not bad, especially considering how long the line was. They know how to turn tables here.  Our entire party thought that the food was better than Hash House, which was more expensive and had a much longer wait time.  I typically try to avoid chain restaurants when on vacation, but Vegas is the exception. Sadly, you can do much worse than Denny's in Vegas. It's not really a strong culinary town. Reliable food and ok wait times."}
{"text":"3.5 stars seems a little more appropriate. Service was ok, nothing great as we waited awhile between refills. Food was good other than the turkey bacon, which was not hot and very limp. Place is clean with friendly staff and the menu has something for everyone. One of the better versions of Denny's."}
{"text":"I like Denny's I do but this one, stay away! It was slow there but service was not good. We had to ask for straws and napkins. There were only 4 tables being service there at 3 pm! My husbands plate of pot roast dinner had no broccoli like the picture just full of starchy potatos. They made my order wrong, took it back, and I was starving so when it finally came I sliced into the Philly cheese prime sandwich and ate it then there was this piece of twig or bone I had to spit out! We told the manager and he said this had happen twice already and swore this piece was not a small twig but a bone! Come on, there is no bone looking like that in prime rib meat, if you cook you know. It looked like a twig or chicken feet bone! He took the piece and told us to have a nice day and left our table. Not having a nice day and not coming back. Not happening at this place."}
{"text":"After watching a movie at Regal Colanade, we got hungry so we stopped by Denny's.  When we walked up to the hostess area, we waited for a few minutes before the hostess asked one of the waiter \"Will you seat THEM for me?\"  I am used to be calling GUEST...but wait, this is Denny's.  Nevermind.  Anyways, we got seated and got our water promptly.  I don't remember the last time I had Denny's but the menu looks pretty good.  They have a $2, $4, $6 and $8 menu, which each group has a mix of appetizer, entree, and dessert.  That seems pretty darn good.  When the waiter came by to take our order, we told him that we would like to order the crispy chicken strips and 2 pancakes.  He walked away and that's when we realized that for the chicken strips, you can order them tossed in honey bbq or hot sauce.  We quickly flagged our waiter down to specify that we want them neither sauce and just have the hot sauce on the side.  He just nodded.  Based on my experience at the restaurant, the waitstaff would ask you how you would like it cook, what sauce would you like with your food, etc, but I guess it's the guests' responsibility?  Wait wait...once again, this is Denny's.  Nevermind AGAIN.  Afterward, we didn't see him until he gave us our check.  Anyways, the food is definitely cheap, but don't expect good customer service.  It is afterall, a Denny's."}
{"text":"Not much a fan of Denny's, in general, but this one is okay. It was a Sunday morning, so it was VERY busy. We had to sit at the counter. We sat and waited for a while before our server came by and THEN we had to ask for a menu. So, a bit of the service was slowish. Food was good, though. We got in pretty quickly and out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"My experience at this Denny's location did not start off well. I had been spending several days, many hours each day, at the hospital across the street visiting my sick mom. I was really tired of eating at the hospital cafeteria so many days in a row and was very hungry, so I walked here to have a late dinner. I was seated at a table and promptly ignored. For 15 minutes! I went back up front and told the girl at the register that maybe I would have better luck sitting at the counter. She felt terrible that no one had bothered to serve me and said she would take care of me right away  - and she did!  I really was in the mood for healthy food and ordered the Wild Alaska Salmon Skillet. It arrived within a few minutes of ordering and it was sizzling hot! There were plenty of delicious veggies on the plate - potatoes, broccoli, mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes. Together with the salmon, I definitely felt recharged and it really hit the spot! The girl at the register saved the day - and this review!"}
{"text":"They are too high! A Belgium waffle should not be $5! Sorry, maybe I'm cheap! So after getting over spending $5+ dollars on ONE WAFFLE, I purchased it! I figured it must be delicious for that price! Lol ..........It was ok. Haven't had many Belgium waffles at various restaurants but, IHOP, I'm sure has better waffles than theirs."}
{"text":"This Denny's is in a great location it's right next to them Frisby park and it was recently remodeled so it's very nice inside there's lots of's seats and it's actually pretty quiet. I would've given five stars but the waiter at this restaurants seem to be very distracted or was too busy or had too many customers but other than that this restaurant location and the atmosphere is a great Denny's"}
{"text":"Visited at 4:30am on 09/05/2016  There was one other table occupied. Server let us seat ourselves which was nice. I asked for very little ice in my coke as we had just come from outside at 5 degrees, it was freezing to me... she was kind enough to bring me a glass with more ice than my bfs, I figured it was a mistake so I removed the ice myself. However through the entire meal for refills etc she was only focused on my bf. I get it, I truly do... you assume your tips coming from the guy and I don't blame you for ensuring his service is top notch. But it felt like something else throughout the meal...Akin to prejudice and dismissive condescension, I have never felt this before in this Denny's  (as we were regulars at their old location)  but it was very noticeable to us... and quiet funny, as her tip was coming from me.  The server asked if I was ok... looked at my empty glass and walked away... it's not really great service nor even mediocre service, it was more like NO service. I still left a 15% tip, far less than I usually tip. I hope this was an isolated event as it was very disappointing to be on the receiving end of that... but next time I am just going to bring it up right then and there.  Food was great as per the usual and came out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"If the service is bad, then the food has a tough job of selling the place.  Considering that this is a Denny's I'm afraid the food didn't have a chance.  Granted the staff were very friendly, they seemed a bit disconnected.  I mean, how many times should you have to specify chocolate milk versus regular milk for your kiddies?!?  Overall a great value for your dollar so if you're looking for a down 'n dirty hot breakfast, this is the place.  It's still just a Denny's....."}
{"text":"B - List. Good family breakfast dinner. Food quality is ok. Portions tend to be somewhat on the larger side but not always generous. Service is relatively fast and friendly. Weekends are very busy and lineups are a possibility. Prices have moved higher with their new menu. Compared to US breakfast places, prices at breakfast establishments north of the 49th are expensive. Ordering off the menu is not always a good deal. Two small eggs and toast will set you back $7.00 and leave you hungry. In the US for a buck and a half more you can get an omlette that will sink a battleship. But again, this is Calgary, where you can go through $100 bucks in a few minutes. Dennys -  It is what it is."}
{"text":"WAAAAAYYYYY too expensive  for the quality of food.  I hadn't been to a Denny's in years and it will be even longer the next time.  Service was horrible.  I guess they don't explain to the servers which tables they are assigned and I don't even want to talk about waiting to pay!  DISASTER!"}
{"text":"This was my Mother's Denny's.  She loved to go here!  She wasn't much for experimenting with wild exotic food like me.  She always suggested either Floridino's or Denny's, or take out from Boston Market.  We always had good meals here.  One of my fav's was the shrimp skewers, which I got more than once.  I think they were only $5.99 or $6.99 for 10  shrimp and two sides.  It might have been from the senior menu.  Whatever, it was always delicious and just the right amount of food, well cooked and well-flavored.  The service was efficient and friendly also.  Pretty consistent, which was probably what she liked.  No surprises.    I miss going there with her.  (Sniff)"}
{"text":"Quick, hot and just what we needed before competing. Brittany was awesome.  Restaurant is clean and will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Well I checked the reviews to find a good dennys close to me. Found this one and glad I did. Jacob is a great, smart intelligent kid who works hard and gave great service. I recommend this dennys and if you can ask for Jacob."}
{"text":"Cheap(for the strip) breakfast food. You're going to a Denny's, you already know what you're getting when you head there."}
{"text":"I  love this Dennys and only this Dennys! Very good food.   The staff are excellent Only one I ever go to the others are horrible!"}
{"text":"This Denny's is great! I've been to many Denny's over the years and the food was good as they s location has that as well. What makes this location is the staff. They are always professional and courteous and do a good job. I've had the pleasure of having Ray as our waiter a few times and he is awesome. Not only does he do a great job but he delivers it with such an amazing positive attitude and smile. It's also very clean and decorated well."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed going to this restaurant. I do not go out to eat often, but when I do it is nice to be able to order decent food at an affordable price. I was really impressed with the quality and taste of their Alaskan salmon and new sweet potato side dish. Also, the servers were wonderful. I know that type of job is a difficult one, so when the servers go out of their way to be helpful and friendly, it means a lot to me. I give those people a lot of credit. Nicely done Denny's, nicely done."}
{"text":"I got the most simplest breakfasts that one can order came out practically frozen everything was cold and old! At least service wasn't bad, So to fix it I got 20% off next time I come in! Ha! like that will ever happen!"}
{"text":"This location seems to be in a sketchy neighborhood and the inside looks old, but the food and service were great."}
{"text":"I love Breakfast st Denny's on a Saturday morning ,with my man, after a hard work week. Our waitress Lisa is the best on the planet. She knows what we like. She asks about our grandson Bailey by name. If there is no room in her station she negotiates with another waiter to make it work. She knows her clientele and goes out of her way to bring a smile and great service."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak omelet Was amazing!  I like am usually disappointed with omlets, they taste too commercial.  But this tasted awesome!    The waitress was ok, nothing worth writing about!  As long as my food was good!  That's what is important to me!"}
{"text":"I walked in at 7am and told the waitress we had between 6-10 in our party. She immediately set up the table and placed menus and waters for wveryone. There was no wait due to the time but she was still very efficient.  All the food came out cooked to perfection. Dennys actually amazed me with there intense work ethic. There was no mistakes made. Give up to the staff for making our coaches breakfast rememorable."}
{"text":"Stephanie (waitress) was extremely knowledgeable about the establishment and was kind enough to share the history with us. Apparently it was a burger joint that burned down. The burger joint was rebuilt as a diner. Denny's purchased it from the owner and turned it into a Denny's with a diner feel.   Stephanie did check in on us, but the food took forever to arrive.   The bathroom was not clean... Which is one of the reasons I dislike public restrooms.   Overall, Stephanie was attentive and friendly. Food was okay but what do you expect from Denny's. ;-)"}
{"text":"I like this Dennys but depends on who the waiter/ress is......we have Antonette as our server and though she was the only one serving she Rocks.....great service great food........big tip coming her way."}
{"text":"Food is always average. ... BUT..that take a pic with pancake. Whoever came up with that character should be fired...its creepy and embarrassing"}
{"text":"It sucks. They took forever to take the order. When they finally did, it took forever to get to the table so we just left"}
{"text":"We were there a couple weeks ago for lunch and I must say service good,food good.. so we decided to have breakfast this morning.. wow.. seated promptly  waitress brought our coffee.we thought this is good. We ordered breakfast. Brought our scrambled eggs, bacon sausage and said pancakes would be right along. Well I don't know how long they were dished up but COLD. I hadn't eaten since the night before because I had to fast for blood work. So we ate them, brought our pancakes good and hot right off the griddle. When I paid our bill t told the girl at the register but I also asked her if these eggs came out of a carton she said yes unless you ask for real eggs that is what you get.. REALLY I thought you always got real eggs unless you ordered fake eggs.. won't be going back for breakfast. Might try lunch again will see.."}
{"text":"We are pretty regular at this dennys. The quality of food for the price is very good. Typically we go at late hours so service is quick and food is delicious. During daytime hours, service is much much slower and the quality of food isn't worth it at all. We went tonight around ten pm and we're sat down, and had to wait almost 15 minutes for the server to ask us what we wanted (not asking about beverages).  We placed our order. Whole waiting another couple sat near us. We waited about 15 minutes with no food, not so bad, but the other couple had yet to even be talked to. They ended up leaving. We waited close to half an hour for our food. No apologies about the wait or any acknowledgement about our well being. The fries with the burger were cold but then burger was warm. All in all that plate was good. My plate had eggs with it. I specifically asked for over medium eggs. I receiver what looked like the correct eggs, but were actually over easy eggs turned upside down to look like over medium eggs. Very disappointed. My pancakes (chocolate peanut butter) were overly topped with peanut butter, but this is just preference. The quality of the food is typically good for what you pay for, but the service is very hit or miss.."}
{"text":"This was the worst simple breakfast that I can remember. From the tasteless omelet to the un toasted toast to the raw hash browns."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, pretty cr@ppy customer service. Our server had a heavy hispanic accent & he was really impatient when we had a ask him few times what kinda soup of the day they had. I'm from LA, so I don't have problem understanding Hispanic accent, but this guy was almost mumbling & mumbling fast with his heavy accent. And he definitely started profiling me when I asked for plain water first. He was hurrying me to order & I could feel he's annoyed. But, his mood was lifted when I ordered steak, turkey sandwich & a kids meal (for wifey, kiddo & me)  Foods were good. Medium rare steak was soft, tender & juicy inside. And her sandwich was awesome. Son's pizza was okey & side order of apples were all sour green apple.  I'd recommend this place for food only. But customer service is big part of restaurant business, as there're lot of other options & better foods"}
{"text":"There was a young lady who helped us was awesome. Unfortunately forgot her name, it starts with K/C (I guess). She was one of the nicest servers I've ever seen. She made a friendship with my 1 and half year old daughter. Very few people can win kids with their smile & friendliness. On the other hand, there was a tattooed lady who was impatience & wasn't welcoming at all. We were waiting to be seated when we were the only ones & no one else around to help us. She passed us by few times & simple 'Just gimme a min, I'll be there with you' would go a long way.  Foods were pretty good. No complains. Denny's is pretty consistence with their quality & flavors. They don't serve steaks from the grill, it's from the griddle. So it's not charred or smoked, but it's pretty good.   If I need a super late night food around Freemont st., this is my joint."}
{"text":"This isn't just another Dennys- this is a Dennys Diner which makes it that much better. If you've ever been to a normal Dennys then you go a Diner you'll experience the difference. I've been going to this Dennys since we moved here in '04. I haven't had a bad experience there BUT and this is a big but..the a/c is typically running on way overdrive and you end up being cold the entire time that you are having your food. The bathrooms are even colder and you are better off leaving and using a bathroom elsewhere. Other then the temperature control I've never had an issue with this Dennys in years."}
{"text":"We went to eat breakfast at Denny's this morning.  We got seated right away which it was a plus.  Krysti our waitress was very pleasantly cheerful and tentative given it was Sunday.  I gave one less star because our food was 1 minute out too soon.  Scrambled egg was undercook, pancake was a bit undercook.  The hash brown was a bit burned on the outside and undercook inside.  If our food cook about 1-2 minutes longer it would have been perfect."}
{"text":"Went again because it looked like new staff was hired. OMG this place used to be ok but now it's horrible.  My wife and I had to wait 30 mins. for our drinks.  And longer for the meal. Then another 30 mins for bill. Anpther table had to wave thier hands and drum on the table to get their bill.There is only 3 people in the whole building. And only one of the four waiters was taking everyones orders. The rest had conversation in the back the whole time. Then the order was completely wrong because of language barrier. I hate this place now. This is Dennys, an iconic American dinner. If you cant understand me and my order then you shouldnt work here. Never coming back and I will tell everyone I know not to EVER go here either. If i could do less than 1 star i would"}
{"text":"They seat you quickly but do not serve you and we were totally abandoned by waiters and no good service don't go there"}
{"text":"Service started out a little slow but once it started I ordered and got my food in less that five minutes and it was super hot. Simple coffee, waitress was nice. What I expect from Denny's."}
{"text":"Is it Denny's? Or did they change their name to Benny's? Just kidding. Unlike IHOP, Denny's kept their original name and also seemed to have keep the same consistency of decent service and average food.  The pricing is affordable, but you can get better quality breakfast food at the same price. The food here took really long to come out and I ordered the steak and eggs. My friend ordered an omelette and that took even longer to come out.   Otherwise, the food quality is alright. Tastes like how it would at any other Denny's. I ordered a medium rare but it seemed to be more medium to medium well. I didn't really mind though, still a somewhat decent steak at an affordable price."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here! I live a few minutes away and I go every so often. The prices are very cheap, but the quality is great! I love their skillets especially, but all their other foods are great as well. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"great service , especially for being so busy on christmas eve. will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"This location gets a 1 star... simply put...not busy, my husband finished his entire meal with out 1 refill.. I had to take his cup to the GM, and request a refill only for the GM to tell me I needed to wait for my server. Of that isn't bad service in the food industry I don't know what is."}
{"text":"We go here late night around 2 am every night we get out of the club nearby. If it weren't for the fact it's 2 am and we're usually pretty hammered I would never stick around for that long to wait for our food to come out! There's usually a wait (even at 2am) the place is packed. There's always a cop sitting at the bar, haha. It just takes forever to get acknowledged when we walk in, to be sat, to have our order taken, to get our food, to get our bill, etc. It usually takes well over an hour for all of this. Under normal circumstances I would walk out of a place like that. If the servers were all really friendly it might make up for it but some are nice and some look like they'd rather be anywhere but there. Which is understandable I guess but still. I do agree that it is fun to people watch here."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's (on rt 18 in Medina.) Pretty standard. The one thing I did particularly like was the old, 50's kind of decor/feel it has. Service was not great but ok. Food was ok, but at 3 AM I was happy to eat anything. Restaurant was not particularly clean and the clientele was interesting (again, 3 AM!). I'm sure I'll be back (and leave unimpressed again.)"}
{"text":"It was one of the best Denny's I've been to. Although they are all nice locations, this particular one was more spacious. We were able to get a booth since that's what my husband prefers. It is very clean and the server along with the hostess were all exceptionally helpful and friendly. I would definitely go there again and recommend it to everyone we know in that area."}
{"text":"Food is alway good and the servers are always nice but every time we go there is only one server so we stopped coming in. It's so frustrating and un enjoyable when they server has to rush everything."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter how many other places I go, I am always down for a late night dirty breakfast. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, and hashbrowns make for a great late night dinner. Free wifi and cheap. Nothing fancy here, just Denny's."}

{"text":"Picture one is the hash browns that were initially brought out to me. After telling my waitress that they were to well done she bought out another order. Undercooked  I don't know if I'd rather have overcooked or undercooked hash browns so I ate neither. My pancakes were brunt, I didn't even bother sending them back. Worst service ever, well wait.. the time before this one we(party of 3) waited an hour and a half after being seated and having ordered our food and our food never came. We had to walk out before being served, us along with other groups of people. What company lets money walk right out the door. Terrible. Take your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!   I stop by here once every 2-3 months because it's near work with the hopes that it will get better , it never does . Waiting staff is super unprofessional, if you pay attention to them you can see they really don't care , just had my food brought to me and it was all wrong , cup of water is dirty.  You get more for your $$$ anywhere else . Seriously . Just eat at home , it's better than a negative experience"}
{"text":"Food was great. The raost sandwhich was so good. The grand slam was good to. Fast service. And military discount was given which is a plus in my book. Nice waitor forgot his name."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Denny's in years and now I remember why, the food isn't that good. I had some slam, not sure which one but everything was bland. The cheesy eggs were some of the worst scrambled eggs I ever had. The hash browns were nothing outstanding either. The sausage links seemed like they were out of the box and microwaved. The toast came with about a pound of butter spread on it. The only good thing was the service. Our server was at our table frequently and kept our glasses filled. No reason to return with all the decent places in town."}
{"text":"Our favorite Dennys.  We love Mary who has been here for several years. Everyone knows everyone.  Food is great."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. Don't compare it to some fancy brunch place by Liberty Village, or that nice diner you found on some posh little street in Yorkville, it's a DENNY'S. It's open 24-hours and they serve their full menu for the entire duration - it's a place you generally eat at for convenience, and some days you just want to feel bad for yourself and stuff yourself with greasy food that's bad for your health. This place is perfect for those occasions.  It's only fair to compare Denny's to similar diners that offer a similar 24-hour service - so compared to Fran's and Golden Griddle, Denny's comes out on top. Not the very top of diner chains though, because it doesn't beat IHOP. Mmm.... IHOP.  Anyway, I dropped by on a Tuesday for lunch after having a crummy day and left feeling a lot better. My server was friendly and full of smiles, which was nice because I was feeling like shit. My food came out quickly and it tasted exactly like the way it looked, full of grease, full of meat, and full of calories. It was the perfect remedy to my mood.  For me the best time to binge on this kind of food is after a night of making poor life choices, because going to Denny's is a good choice in that context. Going to Fran's on the other hand makes me feel like I've just made another bad choice and I just feel worse coming out than I did going in, so I'm glad to see that I now have more options to choose from. For now, Denny's will be my go-to for late-night diners - you'll probably see me there at 3AM on the weekends."}
{"text":"It was a weird experience the last time I went to Denny's.  The food was a bit runny and not to temperature, and we were sat in a cold booth that was a little dirty.  I don't dislike Denny's, and it is a go-to place for when we travel in the country where you may not be sure where to go.  But this one has experienced some hard times.  They should not go \"out-of-pocket\" as they have been, and trying new savory dishes.  Stick to the standards and do them very, very well.  They will be back on top.  The staff here is very nice."}
{"text":"So my first review was great for this newly build \"Denny's\" but boy was I ever so wrong!!!!!  My hubby and I decided to have lunch there on a Saturday afternoon...   Okay so we place a very easy order. It wasn't difficult at all.  The waitress Erika was so sweet but the kitchen screwed up our royally.    Hubby ordered the Turkey club with turkey bacon; easy enough..... RIGHT... WRONG!!!! I ordered the salmon with garlic and herb butter sauce...   I received a dried out piece of salmon w/o and garlic or herbs on it with cold corn and salty  mash potatoes.....  My hubby received a Cali Club which had regular bacon... Not turkey bacon....  This wasn't the first time here, so I was surprised when our food sucked. All of our friends warned us about \"DENNY'S\" but I didn't listen.    So now my YELPER's you listen. Don't waste your money. Your better off going to Crackel Barrel!!!! It's 100 times better than DENNY's!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed and busy with hungry visitors. The staff is very friendly and the service is super fast yet pleasant.  I recommend this location while in Vegas."}
{"text":"When I want breakfast for dinner..server was great despite being the only server on duty and busy, he kept my drink refilled without having to ask, food came promptly and looked good..he did this all with a sense of humor and a smile. Both James and I ordered the Ultimate omelette, hash browns and toast. I added sliced avocado to mine. It was cooked to perfection and was stuffed with yumminess, avocado was fresh, the hash browns crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Only complaint would be the toast wasn't toasted or buttered enough. If your wanting a delish omelette anytime of day or middle of the night,I'd recommend the Ultimate and Denny's on Warm Springs.  Oh and I was able to use the 10% off entire meal..just for checking in on Yelp. Every penny saved counts!"}
{"text":"I got caught at the wrong end of the Las Vegas strip way too late at night to go anywhere nice. Staff at Denny's was attentive for the late hour. Food was typical of a Denny's though."}
{"text":"Visitors beware!!! Service here sucks. They sat us down at our table and we waited for 20mins before I approached a server and questioned what was going on with the service. We hadn't even been approached for drinks!"}
{"text":"Never evwr ever disappoints!! Best bluberry/banana pecan pancakes and omlettes ever. Tried their vege omlette, turkey bacon and cheese omlette,vege skillet with eggs on top and they're all perfect. I even love their coffee, i just dislike their egg benedict."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would !This is probably my worst experience at any Denny's !!! We were constantly ignored by multiple servers before getting acknowledged or welcomed! Our server had a horrible attitude. My friend had added mushrooms to her burger, the cook missed it and we notified our server . She seemed annoyed by the fact that we told her and inclusively she seemed to not believe us. Instead of remaking my friends burger they saut√©ed mushrooms and just added them to her burger ... keep note ... her burger was not under a heat lamp or anything so meanwhile they saut√©ed mushrooms her burger dropped Temp and her burger buns became soggy!!!! The mushrooms are just thrown on top and clearly the presentation of the burger was horrible!"}
{"text":"Total 5 stars for Server Ross who ran her butt off while everyone else was sleeping today but what was more offensive was the blaring country western music that was going nonstop from the time we arrived to the time we left... So Denny's the sixties style Diner has gone country or at least for today since their normal manager decided to go on vacation for the next couple days ...when the cat's away the mice will play country music all day..."}
{"text":"I have always received excellent service at this Denny's. Food is always prompt, hot and good. I like the new decor."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken avocado sandwich and a slam here. Food was cold, the sandwich didn't have avocado and was cold. It took them 30 min to redo it. I've lost my appetite at this point. Slam was also subpar compared to other Denny's I've been to."}
{"text":"To be honest, I didn't know that there were still Denny's restaurants around. I have fond memories of Denny's breakfasts and late-night coffee runs from decades ago, but hadn't been to one in ages when I suddenly learned there was one not far from home.  What a pleasant surprise ---  it wasn't a trip back to the 1970s, and yet, it was still Denny's.   Still, Denny's continues to make good breakfasts (but they seem less greasy and heavy than they used to be) and now the menu includes a tasty \"light\" meal that fits my low-cal needs. My daughter and I have gone several times for a quick, casual dinner that doesn't break our diet.  The service is decent; the food is tasty. And breakfast, anytime. I'm in!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible at this location. We saw several people leave because their food was taking to long. Took forever for a server to take our order and had to wait to check out. Won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"I just say I had the best service today. The waitress was very polite seated us right away and got our drinks right out. The food was good and my over round experience was great."}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday thinking it wouldn't be an issue and that's all we had. They were out of the kids menu's for starters, then when we asked the waiter what was in the meals offered he had no idea. Ok so we finally get our order in and only half comes. We waited 15 min for the other half. Then my sisters omelet which was Swiss, cheddar and ham only had cheddar, we tell the waiter. HE BROUGHT A COLD SLICE OF SWISS CHEESE TO THE TABLE! We then sent it back and asked for it to be melted. He brought it back with no cheddar! Literally thought this was a joke...then my nieces spaghetti didn't have the bread with it and it never came. Never got refills on any drinks. Asked for the manager and they took off the omelette but still never brought the bread. And we are still waiting for the check 20 min later. Will never come here again. I'll go to the deer valley one instead. BIG FAIL"}
{"text":"We've come here twice and both times the server was too incompetent to get our order right. Waited almost 20mins for our food AND drinks and they still fucked up our order. Most definitely will not be coming again."}
{"text":"Ok....it's Dennys. My expectations aren't that high. That said, I couldn't believe what they tried to serve this morning. Called in for pick up and after having confirmed my order at least 3 times over the phone, I found that not only had they left 3 things off my order, but also that the pancake puppies were burnt beyond recognition to the point that they even burned through the styrofoam container they were put in. When I called in, I was put on hold for 10 minutes before the manager came on the line, made me re-explain the situation and then told me to come in and get another one or get my money back. No apologies or even a surprised tone...just matter of factly. When I asked if the replacement pancake puppies would be on her (the principle... not that the 1.99 was going to break me) she said she reluctantly agreed to give a coupon for next time. Mmmm... that's ok. Don't think there will be a next time. Up your standards to edible, please, Dennys."}
{"text":"Ordered food from here to have it delivered, once received the food everything was cold. We were missing pancakes and toast from the grand slam. Unfortunately we will not be ordering from here again due to the lack of customer service as well as the food quality."}
{"text":"Been trying to find a replacement Denny's since we've moved that was always our go-to place. It was pretty much perfect, however, this one is not it. Seems like the waiter forgets you're there... or doesn't bring everything you order... only been here once and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Never really had a bad experience here. There have been exceptional service on a few occassions. You just have to find the right time where the right waiters are working so that you may enjoy your meal with great service. I'd say about half the staff are actually good at what they do. I go here at all times to test out my theory and most of the good waiters work the late shift."}
{"text":"This Denny's wasn't even great. Food was actually cold and the service was horrid. Sorry. Won't come back."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. You come for consistent menu, consistent service and the chain experience.  This location is cleaner and friendlier than the other one nearby. It's your typical diner food, not a lot of flare and not really home made flavor like you'd fine at mom & pop, but the service is stellar and feels homey. We were seated fast on a Sunday and served with a smile. Our order was quick and accurate. Solid stop while traveling and it seemed they were extra friendly with their regulars."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, and great value for breakfast. The servers were all (ours and others within the restaurant) friendly and fast with great advice, the food was good and large portions for the $, overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Service here is fantastic and food was delicious. This was the first place I took my girlfriend on a date and now it's traditional lol. We love it there!"}
{"text":"Did you know Denny's has a loyalty card proram now?  They do, and after you sign up, you get a free \"build your own slam\" breakfast.  Hubby & i went for breakfast this morning (since i had the freebie).  I told my server that I wanted to redeem my free build your own slam breakfast special.  She swiped my card and told me that when I was done to just give my card to the cashier and it will be taken off.  So, we had our breakfast then went up to pay for our meal. The cashier said, oh you have a free build your own slam, swiped my card and handed me the receipt to sign.  My slam was not taken off the total which I pointed out to her.  She said oh, I didn't know you wanted to use this, I can't change it because I already swiped your card.  Well, then I got hostile.  told her if you saw this was a freebie, why didn't you ask if I wanted to use it?  And, can't you refund my card then recharge it with the correct amount?  she says well you still have a month to use it - sorry dummy if it expires on 8/10 and I was there on 7/26, how is that 1 month?  Kinda upset, no one got a tip from me that day!"}
{"text":"Juan usually is the one who serves me and my boyfriend. he is so nice and attentive. he always comes around to make sure our drinks are filled and if we need anything else. some people think all dennys are alike but it's the customer service that really stands out."}
{"text":"The stars are only for the great customer service we got from Jaywan. We were down this weekend for a Raidernation Takeover event. We popped late last nite for a bite to eat. The waiter Jaywan was very quick to respond to whatever we needed, as well as his other tables. Unfortunately, my food was disgusting. I ordered the cheesesteak omelet, and it was filled with egg shells. Three different bites (as if I didn't learn any from first two bites) had crunchy eggshell pieces in it. Very disappointing. I wouldn't go back to eat here, but I may pop in for their buy one get one free mimosas."}
{"text":"So, we came here cause it was on the way and knew it had bad reviews. My wife had eaten here a month ago and had a positive experience. This experience was bad. There were four adults and five kids so we expected it to be crazy and to have some issues with the orders. Well, we did. Lots of issues. We waited for 30 minutes for our meal....after waiting 20 minutes to have our order taken. Finally got it. Part of it. They slaughtered the order. We waited an hour for two of the meals to finally show up. We waited almost as long for one glass of orange juice as well, even after repeated requests. We were able to get one refill of half our water glasses midway through the ordeal. Luckily, we were able to get the other half filled after most of us finished our meals. There were a few semi apologies but that was all the communication we received until close to the end when we were informed our server was new. One of the issues was that all these servers were pretty much hanging out by the coffee maker chatting or something the majority of the time. The three other tables of people in the restaurant came and went and it was definitely not busy. I almost went for two stars to be merciful but there really weren't many redeeming qualities to our visit. My meal was delicious but not the same for everyone else. Most of the pancakes were over cooked. We had to go grab some other tables syrup for our pancakes. I gave one star because the food was edible and good (hit or miss).  When we received the bill it was jacked up. From the time we entered until we left we were approx 2 hrs."}
{"text":"Happy birthday, Jessica!  Hands-down, the best waitress I've ever met.. and she worked on her birthday!  The food was what you would expect, plus sticky menus, and dishes continually being dropped (loudly) in the kitchen.  But, the service was outstanding, even when we occupied our table for two hours on a busy Sunday."}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the years.  Recently I found myself two weeks in a row having to kill time while working and this was the nearest place that sounded good in the area.  Typical Denny's, ok but not exciting.  Most of the food was cooked properly but the hash browns both times were ok on the outside but not fully cooked in the middle.  I am going to date myself a little bit here.  To me it looked like an old Sambo's except the counter has now gone away to be replaced by another row of booths.  So I asked my server about this and he said it was indeed a Sambo's when he used to visit his parents in Sun City from Florida many years ago and became a Denny's around 1975 when Sambo's folded."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area of this Dennys for about 17 years and never before stopped.  It just went through a major remodel that apparently even moved the entrance door.  So everything is fresh and new.  The food was ok, I tried the seasonal pumpkin pancake breakfast. Service was adequate.  6AM I was surprised there was no coffee ready or even brewing."}
{"text":"This place is not the best to go to at all I have gone 2 different times thinking the survas would be nice i was wrong. The first time we went their the waitress was so flustered like she did not now how to do her job for getting to put stuff in the computer for us and admiting to it. The second time we went we placed out drink order 10 minutes later they come over and say oh the tea is still beaing made why can't they come over and tell us this before we sit for 10 minutes. Then I ordered a skillet and when it got to me my eggs were made wrong and my food was cold like it had sat for a while. The other thing that made me so mad was the waitress we had her boyfriend came in and sat down at a booth and she was all over their talking to him after I had asked for toast witch I was mad because I asked for it with my food never came at all. I will not go back their ever again they need to re teach the staff how to do their jobs."}
{"text":"Filthy restaurant, restroom and cold food. Terrible service, waitress overwhelmed and did I say cold food. Never going back."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  . Came in for a family dinner late evening. Restaurant not very crowded but seemed to be short staffed.  Waited to be seated about 5-10 minutes then waited 15 before waitress came to table for drink order we opted to give our full orders then waited at least 40 to 50 minutes for our meals.  Again this place was not busy. Service was bad several years ago but had improved greatly sorry to see slip back."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak more like chicken fried doodoo, nastiest chicken fried steak I ever had in my life. I'll stick to the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"For starters, when I entered the restaurant, the man at the register failed to greet me.  Having just seen the movie \"Transcendence\", I politely sat on the waiting bench (although I was the only one waiting) and Google'd its plot; I sat there at least 10 minutes, partially into my phone and partially waiting to see how long it would take for him to say something, anything.  The gentleman never acknowledged I entered the building until I finally got up and sat myself.  A minor annoyance, mind you...  But the bottom line is, my pancakes were cold, my grits were soaking in butter but still had no flavor (0 salt), and my links tasted like rubber.  The only thing made perfectly were my eggs and my orange juice.  And to top it all off, my server served up my #1 pet peeve... she brought the check to the table in the MIDDLE of the meal, the ultimate in discourteousness in my book!!!  I will NEVER come back to this location... EVER."}
{"text":"They weren't rude, and one person said she'd \"be right with me,\" calling me \"hon.\"  It's 1am, and I can't sleep and I'm hungry and like food too much to try and sleep on an empty stomach. Was walked by without being seated... Waited... Waited... Walked by again. Maybe IHOP will seat me. Or maybe I'll just go back home. I'm too tired to care at this point. I left. To be fair, they were relatively busy, but with larger parties than little ole' me..."}
{"text":"Just tried to order through grub hub was forced to tip 15% or more not allowed to use the custom tip feature on the app for anything less than that, also can not choose to not tip. Delivery fee is 3.99 way to high to be trying to enforce a tip in the already high priced food on your menu."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Denny's for years.  I've always had great service even if it was a table for one or a table for four.  I like that you can build your own grand slam and it ends up costing less than 10 bucks including a drink. Last year around this time they came out with the red, white, and blue slam. I'm quite a fan. You get the choice of your type of eggs, bacon, hash browns, and the best part is the pancakes! It's three pancakes covered with strawberries, blueberries and a little bit of icing and whipped cream.  Don't order it if you don't like something a little sweet. Right now they have these hash brown tots that you can substitute for the hash browns.  Dip them in a little sour cream and they are delicious! I know Denny's is a chain restaurant but I wanted to share these limited time meals they have available. I posted a picture so you can get an idea of their new temporary Independence Day menu. Yes, this is just a Denny's and it is a chain restaurant after all.  This one just has higher standards than usual and great service even when it's packed. Lourdes is a great server if you can catch her when she's working. Everyone is friendly and the restaurant is clean. Check it out."}
{"text":"a little over priced...charging me $1 more for some cheddar on my mash potatoes???? wow!!! ihop here i come."}
{"text":"Clearly, I was inebriated beyond belief. This was right after a glorious adventure at XS. I had met a new delightful friend and we walked here, or better yet stumbled here. The usual Denny's. Nothing special. We ate.  Upon leaving, I hadn't realized it then but my phone accidently fell out of my pocket. Once I got back to my hotel room I noticed it was missing. Losing your phone in Vegas is pretty much losing touch with reality. In a fit of panic I called over and they were kind enough to hold onto it for me.   Again, still inebriated. I thought it was just a hop, skip and jump from my hotel room so I decided to walk instead of taking a taxi. It's approximately 6am, crazy hot and I'm walking. As I continue to walk, I begin to realize that it is ALOT further than I thought. Urgh....   Finally got my phone back with a pleasant txt msg waiting for me. I can exhale.  Thanks to this Denny's for holding onto it! Saved my life."}
{"text":"I love breakfast so I enjoy any kind of breakfast food. The food was alright... bacon a little two burnt. The potato hashbrown was falling apart. The taste was good! I'll try and order something else for a more solid review"}
{"text":"On May 1st, I attended a kids' birthday party there. Our server was Tinisha. She was absolutely amazing. She really encompassed not just satisfactory but excellent customer service. If you haven't been to Dennys on a Sunday, it can get really, really hectic there. However, she didn't faze under pressure and maintained a positive attitude. There was a couple of orders that she forgot (totally excusable and even expected especially if there's 30 of us she had to take orders from) but she kept a good composure, admitted her mistake and apologized. The thing is I've had good customer service in the past, but with Tinisha, I felt like she was really sincere. It felt like she was serving us as if we were guests at her own home.  Dennys, you're very lucky to have Tinisha. She's gold!"}
{"text":"Bambi is our server and she is so attentive and accomodating. Breakfast is a typical Danny's style very good and reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is the Pitts (putting it mildly).we walked in after church on a Sunday afternoon,my friend's young boys wanting Denny's pancakes,we got there the place was empty after waiting a few minutes to be seated the host walked us past eight empty stalls that would have been fine for the 5 of us three adults and two young boys,she put us way in the back next to the stinky restrooms then after 5 minutes of waiting we decided to bail,mind you the place was near empty.We did not want to make a scene in front of the boys we decided to eat at an other place where we we're treated with respect,my take this place or the workers do not take well to people not like them.The restaurant was dated and it was dirty if i where the owners of the Denny's name i would make this franchise change their name,guess they don't realize that the 60's are long gone."}
{"text":"I am a frequent Denny's customer and every time I go I never know what to expect. Most of the time I get great service from the waiter but there has been a few times that I am sitting waiting and waiting for a refill on my drink. There were at least 2 times that I have gone and nobody came to give me a refill on my beverage or ask me if I needed anything. I am pretty easy to please and I not expect much when I go out an eat at a Denny's but a refill on my coffee ever now and then would be nice. Besides that the food is always pretty good and they have really cheap deals."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast. Seated very quickly. This location is busy. And the waitstaff was very friendly and food was served quickly"}
{"text":"On 12/4/17 we walked to Denny's which was little walk from our hotel. We had been here at least two times prior for breakfast and had great service and food. We ordered our breakfast and we waited for the food. Once our order was served one person in our group noticed that her pancakes tasted funny. She had ordered white chocolate and raspberry pancakes, as she cut into the pancakes and started to eat them she tasted pecans in the pancakes. As she started to look into what she was served the noted that the raspberry's were somewhat moldy. She stopped eating her food and called over the server. She spoke quietly to the server and told them about what she found. As the rest of the table listened the server just walked away without a word. We figured that they would bring back a Manager to speak with us. We then watched as the server walked past us several times only to came back to the table to drop off the check and again to walk away. We then picked up the check to go to the register to pay. We thought someone would speak to us to check on what was found, no one spoke to us before we left or took any info on the issue. We were disappointed to say the least in their professionalism."}
{"text":"We stayed out looking for a place to eat breakfast cheap. We found Denny's right by the Casino Royale. We got in and the place was taking names for tables. We put our name in the list and was called about  5 minutes and seated. The waitress was friendly and helpful. It's Denny's,  standard food but it's a quick cheap meal. Our waitress kept our coffee cup full and was very attentive. All in all a standard Denny's meal and the prices are about normal"}
{"text":"There was a hype for this restaurant and I decided to go and try it with my family for breakfast. It was very busy when we walked it, the place was bustling with people ordering, talking, and eating their food. The servers seemed like they were in a rush to get things done. My family and I ordered but they got our order messed up. So we had to wait a lot longer, but the food was warm when it was given to us so I guess that's pretty good. The food was alright, it wasn't anything special. There's free wifi, so when you enter make sure to look at the password placed at the front desk. Overall I would come back again but it's not at the top of the list for a breakfast place."}
{"text":"This is my second time here....all I can say is wow!! Not one things has changed since the opening. Restaurant is not busy, no line, tables open...and it is still taking 40 mins to get food. I ordered online...it was supposed to be ready at 10:25....10:40 and still waiting. A couple leaving says \"it doesn't take 40 mins. to cook breakfast\". I agree! Staff is extremely unprofessional in the way they speak to you & their blazee attitude. I really thought, given time this place would improve...not happening!!!"}
{"text":"A typical Denny's.  I came here recently with some coworkers for breakfast before work.  I hD the meat lovers omelet, which was surprisingly good.  The service was friendly and attentive.  Don't come here if you're looking for a quality meal in an upscale restaurant.  Instead, come if you want something quick, tasty and cheap.  You will leave satisfied."}
{"text":"This is a timeless spot and it has been here 40 plus years, I've been going all me life, so they must be doing something right. They have such a great management staff and they work hard to resolve issues. I saw how they dealt with the crazy aggressive customers, and they handle them like a champ.   Pricing is affordable. They do need to staff better in the am, many customers get rushed trying to get to work, be mindful of that, other wise great job!"}
{"text":"Awful experience ever! First off the dining room had tables full of plates and drinks left over. I understand it gets busy but there was only one worker who bothered to clean up while 3 others just stood around in the kitchen. Secondly, I odered an omelet dish and what I received was hurendous. Burnt mushrooms barely any meat, no cheese melted inside or on the outside. Omelet was the smallest I've seen at a restaurant. Returned it back and the 2nd one still turned out the same. My guests were already done with their food while I had to wait almost 25 mins. I ordered something different than omelet seeing that the cook couldn't get it right. The only reason why I put 1 star was because the waitress. She was kind, sincere, and made sure I wasn't charged for my food. This sealed the deal for me tho, definitely last time coming here. Such a shame."}
{"text":"This place is great I loved the food it tasted great I got the double berry pancakes and it tasted great I would like to go back and get this again"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.  Apparently the illegals cooking the food can't read English.  Wanted red potatoes, got under-cooked hash browns.  When the red potatoes finally came, they were fried dark brown.  How is this appetizing?  The English Muffin was nothing more than warm and untoasted with a copious amount of whatever yellow liquid they apply.  My wife's \"Over medium\" eggs were over easy at best and her toast was the same way.  For an Easter Sunday at 8am they weren't overly busy, but you couldn't tell by the wait staff who looked haggard and ridiculous.  Not going to go back here again.  If you want a great breakfast in Buckeye, AZ.  try the Sheep Camp Diner in the City of Buckeye,near the middle of Old Town. Best breakfast in town"}
{"text":"The food was good and the prices especially for the strip were good. Our waitress however was a disappointment. All she cared about was getting you in and out. She asked us twice when we were going to leave. Sadly we will probably be back for the price if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. Really low price for a giant dish. Play zone for kids. I will definitely return with my family."}
{"text":"Great service, food was great and came out fast. Much better than the Denny's in Parma."}
{"text":"If you're craving Denny's take a 5 minute trip down Ridge Rd and go to the parmatown one. Dinner time on Saturday place is empty, I know why now. All 4 meals ordered came out wrong."}
{"text":"Of all my denny's experiences, this one had been the best location. The staff is friendly, the food is quick, and its clean. The area outside is nice, and well lit."}
{"text":"I've yet to have a truly bad experience here, but the food takes an Eternity, the staff seem to hate working there and frequently forget to come back to the table. we live right by this denny's, and yet when we do our denny's get-togethers (unlimited pancakes are one of the few pluses.) We would much rather drive the extra few miles to the one on country club and southern."}
{"text":"Omg I was reading previous reviews about the broken AC and I swear I was freezing in there today! They set the AC super low and thank the lord I had my husband's jacket in the car or else I wouldn't have been able to handle. My poor husband though, he was shaking like a little chihuahua. Anyways, I think it's a hit or miss at this place. The first time I came her I ordered the grand slam and it was to perfection (it was also cold but I wasn't seated under the AC so wasn't as bad as today). The grand slam I had today was not as fresh and it was cold. I'm not sure was it because they left my food out for a while or because the AC just knocked the temperature of my food down but I didn't enjoy it today.   Management, I know you guys had AC issues but that doesn't mean you guys should set the temperature so low that no one could handle. A man walked passed my table and was screaming about how cold it was!  Service was decent btw."}
{"text":"I had to eat my eggs with a steak knife because I didn't have silverware. It worked better than I thought but I mean, it wasn't ideal.  L O L at this \"restaurant\".. Like now... I'M MAD  Well it was terrible service but hey between the dirty tables, forever long drink order, lack of silverware I'm just happy I actually got food after an hour.  NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN   WHYYY was the waitresses titty out? She walked around frowning at us all... with her tits out free and proud.  Just terrible, everything took absolutely forever and we're still on work time here....how hard is it to get silver ware and a couple waters. Currently waiting for the check...who knows when that'll be. DO NOT COME HERE BE WAERY EVIL SPIRITS A LURKIN.  This was reviewed by 6 different people. PEACE OUT DENNYS"}
{"text":"8 pm Monday, no ice tea, and plastic bread bag clip in our burger.  Should be negitave 2 stars."}
{"text":"Poor service. Waitress with an attitude, manager with lies. Don't come here. I know I will never return. Read my yelps. You'll know I'm open minded n give good reviews when warranted. The service here was so bad I almost cried! Leeka was sullen and ignored me while I was waiting for my car a/c to be fixed nearby. I would've left a fat tip but instead she pulled the whole place down with a bad review, a customer who will never return, and who will also spread word of mouth to others to never go there!"}
{"text":"I am very conflicted while writing this review. My wife and kids made a decision to eat at Denny's on Easter Sunday. The wait to be seated was no longer then 5minutes. Once seated we all had our orders in mind. We exchanged orders with the waitress, we wouldn't see our food for another 45+ minutes.. The building was not as busy to justify the long wait.. Unacceptable.."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go for lunch amazing food, amazing service, give it a go its an amazing diner"}
{"text":"Food is good and service has gotten better. I feel bad that they don't have more business. They have the $2, $4, $6 menu item...what could be better than that? All you can eat pancakes for $4. Yum! Give it a try. I don't think you will be disappointed...but then everyone has their own opinion. Kids eat free on Tuesday and Thursday (I think, call to verify)"}
{"text":"Been there twice. Service is nice, although the second time I went or food, our server actually had a sense of humour which me and my friends loved! :D  Got the Philly Omelet which is now the cause of my growling stomach thinking about it. Cheesy, and meaty. What else could you possibly want at midnight?!   This place is also open late, which is a plus for anybody who crawls downtown.   I think the service could be a bit more attentive though, no offence! Still will come back to Denny's, nothing tastes better than cheesy meat at 12 in the morning."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this Denny's the past two Sundays for breakfast.  Food was good both times.  The service, however, needs help, literally.  This place is UNDERSTAFFED!  It took two hours to eat breakfast this morning for three adults and a child.  I have never had to/a wait upon entering a restaurant not because there were no tables, there were PLENTY of tables?  The small staff could just not get people to tables quickly enough!!!  Everyone was working hard, they just need MORE PEOPLE!!!  We had to wait for a table, then wait for a waitress, then wait a long time for the food to be cooked and served.  We drank TOO much coffee with all this waiting.  The clientele is quite diverse."}
{"text":"This place is the most stupidest and unprofessional Denny's I've ever been! Me and my son was standing for 20 minutes and all the workers just been passing by and ignoring us! There's only few people inside eating and employee was just there starring at us. I've been here couple times and they were the same, I was assuming things will change. I owned my own business and for someone running a business like this is ridiculous. Do not go to this location!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would!!! There was only one guy running around while two other employees looked like they were lost!! He was trying his hardest while his co workers just stood there. One of the guys was too busy tending to 2 crack heads. Place was very messy! Waited to be seated and was not even acknowledged. The guy helping the 2 crackheads finally saw me and went the other direction! He was too bust giving them free drinks. Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to eat breakfast for him and lunch for me. My husband ordered the salted caramel banana pancakes with scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon and sausage with coffee. I ordered the club sandwich with onion rings and ice tea with lemon.  Our waitress was very friendly and she checked in with us often, refilling our drinks and making sure everything was okay.  Our food was delicious and fresh. Everything was great: service, food, clean restaurant and restrooms. The cashier was friendly when I checked out. I had a 20% coupon Denny's emailed to me last month. Our bill was reasonable and I left a 20% tip for our waitress because she definitely earned it. I know she works hard as evidenced by her frequent checking on us. We will return in the near future to this location."}
{"text":"My husband and my grown children and i went to this location the evening of my 50th birthday on September 21, 2015. It was newly opened. The interior is decorated in old style 50's diner with a twist of modern added. There are different logos of Denny's displayed over the years in the center of the restaurant. A combination of dinner and breakfast was ordered by everyone in my party. Our waitress was fun and attentive. The food was cooked and prepared with care. For diner food it was really good. When we were there it was pretty quiet. Denny's gives a military discount too. I would recommend going to this location if you are in the area and are looking for a place that serves tasty, hot food."}
{"text":"My graduation brunch with my family. We were famished after I graduated from Ottawa University which was held in Surprise. My fit breakfast was awesome with fresh egg whites and spinach, turkey bacon, fresh fruit and yogurt.  My family's food was prepared fresh and served hot. Everything was delicious! Service was great! We enjoyed our food . I recommend this location of Denny's."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with good fast service. I love Denny's breakfast, and was not disappointed this time either."}
{"text":"Service sucked, I ordered  scranble eggs and toast.i was  charge 4.99 and the next day I order the same thing and was charge $9.00. Waiter is over charging and keeping the over charge as a tip. I  am going  to have a talk with management.when I return.i want to see if they pull the same scam  again"}
{"text":"Ordered here for the first time by going in to do a take out order. I tried calling for 30 min to get bussy signal every time i called. So i just drove there to place my order because i thought that they were really busy on Presidents day. I got there and it was not busy as i thought. Maybe they forgot to hang up the phone. I ordered biscuits and gravy with bacon eggs and saugage. Breakfast sandwich, omelette and one meal came with a coffee and juice. I left to go do something to wait for my food to be cooked. I came back and it was ready. The lady helping me was so nice. Everything was pretty good but the biscuits and gravy could have been better. The gravy was a little bland and the crumbles of sausage was almost non existing. Like they dont do it homemade or something. Good homemade biscuits and gravy would be good if anyone can even make it. It should contain large chunks of sausage and creamy tastfull gravy. But anyway it was one biscuit pulled apart and gravey on top. So portion size was horrible."}
{"text":"I came and got wheat pancakes and eggs! It was excellent! No BS! Seems when I goto other more pricey restaurants in Vegas, they seems to never cook right. I come here a lot to this Denny's because food is always great! And presentation of food is great too!"}
{"text":"Good Denny's. Food and service were very good. Really a very decent place to eat. We were traveling and this was a easy walk from the Hampton. Menu selection was good for a meal other than breakfast."}
{"text":"This use to be my after bar greasy spin stop before crashing.  Stopped last night after a few too many drinks.  No one was at the front area to check in with host/hostess.  After waiting 15 minutes decided they didn't care we were there.  Left and went to a competitor."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to Denny's but a friend was in town and wanted breakfast.   I ordered the salted caramel and banana cream pancakes. The server was nice and asked the kitchen if I could have extra red potatoes because I don't like eggs. The pancakes were delicious but very sweet. The sweetness became a bit too much half way through and I was unable to finish them.   We also ordered red velvet hushpuppies. They were really really good.    The prices were very inexpensive and the service was good."}
{"text":"Never again will i eat at Denny's.  This experience has turned us off for good.    My husband ordered the double cheese burger sub out beef for veggie patty. The tomato was old and mealy. The veggie pattys are nasty here, most places have fairly good ones now days so there is no reason to have mush.   I had the veggie omelette and the first time they brought it to me NONE of the veggies where cooked.  The second time they were warmed.  I couldn't even eat it it smelled nasty.  They waitress took it off our bill but  if this is the quality of their cooks then nothing that comes out of that kitchen will be good.  My husband said he will never eat at Denny's again. I won't either!  Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"No wonder this restaurant only gets two stars. I would go to 1,5. Not everything is bad though. Yesterday, my gf and I ordered a cold brew coffee and a coffee. I was shocked how the waitress dropped of the cup of coffee off holding it with her 5 fingers on the top edge of the cup, right there where my gf had to put her lips for drinking it. So I asked the waitress right away if she would appreciate it if I would bring her cup of coffee, holding it with the tips of my fingers around the edge, with my, who knows, dirty hands? She shruged and said that it was the way they told her to do so. No consideration of replacing the cup. Minutes later, when I was half on my iced coffee, I looked at the glass that was sitting on the table with the window light as the background. The top edge of the glass was over halfway the circle imprinted with greasy lip prints (not mine, because thankfully I was drinking it with a straw. When the 2nd waitress came by for asking if my gf wanted a refill and telling that unfortunately the iced coffee did not come with a refill, I told her: I would not want a refill. Look how dirty this glass is with lip prints. She just answered: Well, let me know if you want something else. At this point I wanted to leave the restaurant but my gf chose to stay. The skillets we ordered were quite good, especially considering the affordable pricing. Maybe, you get what you pay for, but next time, I will skip this affordable but dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how excited I was when I found out there was a Denny's close to where I live! It's open 24 hours a day so it's an excellent option any time of day. The food is exactly as you would expect from the chain, but this location lacks the same staff training. The waitstaff doesn't seem very interested in serving you. It took a few attempts to get my waitress' attention in order to ask for a refill. It's also a relatively quiet location which is nice."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern,  This morning Saturday, October 25th, 2014, myself and a group of 3 others visited your Denny's location in Las Vegas, NV at 12:20 am. (Address: 7071 W Craig Rd #101, Las Vegas, NV)  (12:20 AM) When walking in the door we were not greated, nor even aknoweledged.   (12:30 AM) Only when another group of four walked in the door did the hostess come and take the group behind us to their table and left us standing at the doors.  (12:35 AM) We were finally asked the number of people in our group. At which time she said she would be back after clearing a table for us.   (12:40 AM) We were seated and asked for our drink orders before we had our menus in hand. We asked her for waters so we could decide on drinks while she got the waters.  (1:15 AM) Another waitress, Irene, came by the table and asked us if we had ordered our drinks and we let her know we had asked for waters from the other girl and still had not recieved them 35 minutes since sitting down. She than took our drink orders - melted/watered down Iced coffee and said she would be back to get our meal order in a minute. And we did not get the waters we asked for 35 minutes before.  (1:30 AM) We stopped Irene to ask her if she could get us hot coffee instead because our previous mentioned Iced coffees were still sitting there full because they were very bad. She got us new coffees right then and again said she would be back to get our meal order in a minute.  (1:45 AM) She finally came to get our order taken. And, we told her that we needed a strawberry milkshake to go when we got our check in a styrophome cup.  (1:55 AM) Our food was made and left to sit in the plate warmer. Did not see either waitresses anywhere...  (2:15 AM) The cook comes out of the kitchen to take our plates out because they'd been up in the window for so long and not picken up - still no sign of the waitresses. He tries to hand them to the wrong table - who have been sitting there 30 minutes without their drinks even ordered.  (2:20 AM) Our food is placed on our table by the *no name tag* watress. The fries are cold. The toast is soggy. No drink re-fills and no water glasses still given. We asked for syrup and honey mustard.  (2:22 AM) She brought one honey mustard. And I asked again for syrup to which she scoffed and walked off..  (2:30 AM) Asked again for the other honey mustard and the syrup to which the *no name tag* replied: \"You are NEEDY.\" than walked off and brought back only the syrup... Still no offers for drink refills on all of our empty cups.  (2:45 AM) We were all done eating. Drinks and plates all empty - besides the food we decided not to eat because it was too burnt or soggy or cold.  (3:00 AM) Irene came by and asked if we wanted our check. She than took our dirty plates and added them to the table behind ours stack of dirty plates from an hour before when the other table left.  (3:05 AM) Check was brought to the table and offered up our credit card to pay the bill.  (3:20 AM) Irene finally showed up with the paid check and credit card totalling $57.11 and asked for the tip part to be filled out and for it to be signed.  (3:22 AM) Irene came back to get the signed copy of the receipt and saw that she was left with a (generous -  in reference the service we received) 89 cent tip - making our total come to $58.00. She said \"I only get an 89 cent tip?\" to which I replied \"Yes, our service tonight between you and the other girl deserved that.\" and she said, \"You think I was only worth 89 cents?\" and I said, \"Yes.\" So she picked up the signed copy and the customer copy and stormed off..  (3:25 AM) We exited the door and left."}
{"text":"Today the best experience ever food was awesome and service was great!!! They were busy but quick!!! I loved mrs Pamela enthusiasm and her beautiful smile and how she helped her customers. She wasn't my waiter but just observing her was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Kinda low staff but supper friendly and prompt, and accommodating to get orders out, may have came at the awkward shift change but better than the Ihop down the street for sure"}
{"text":"I don't even know, where to start. Last day in Vegas and I wanted to try Denny's for my first time and let's just say it was a horrible experience.It was pack but the wait was about ten minutes if that. Our server Patricia had the only nasty attitude, like she didn't want to be bothered. So we ordered our food and my plate came out without my bacon and sausage that came with the breakfast and when I tried to tell our server she gave me even more attitude like I was asking for something extra. All I wanted was what I ordered. It's like everything that we asked for seemed to be an issue. There was no sugar on the table and my friend asked for some for her and even that was handled with attitude.The food was cold, The pancakes was extremely dry. The one plus was the coffee was actually good."}
{"text":"There's a second Denny's in Oakville. It's 24 hours and attached to the Sandman hotel. You won't find prices like you find at Denny's in the USA. But you'll find a decent, clean restaurant with many of your favorites. Didn't notice Moons Over My Hammy on the menu but you'll find the country fried steak and grand slam breakfasts.  All n all not a bad place to grab a quick, familiar meal before taking in a flick at the nearby Cineplex."}
{"text":"So first time here at this Denny's. First look pretty empty. Maybe about 8 people dining inside. When we entered we were greeted right away and told they'd be with us shortly. Next our waitress \"Brooklynn\" helped  us. She was super nice and I appreciated the fact that she tried to make conversation and even complimented my dress! She was awesome in asking if we needed anything every 10 minutes. She has a very nice smile and I would come back just because of her!!! Thanks Brooklynn you are amazing!"}
{"text":"Our table service was amazing and the food was good. But we waited over 5 minutes to cash out at the register. They seemed very understaffed on the front.."}
{"text":"Let's get real about Denny's. It's a diner that's inexpensive and fast. This Denny's is the Denny's of Denny's in my opinion and it is because of the servers. They are amazing. Some of them have been there for a very long time and let's face it - we as customers suck, people. For the most part. I've been a server. This Denny's was remodeled to its cute inside. It's not gigantic. There is always a wait because of location, but the bar isn't the secret. Dammit. Gave it away. No wait there most times I go. And I go Sunday mornings when it's crowded as hell. The church crowd has just let out.  Bless these servers and this Denny's will always get five starts from me. Fast, friendly, clean as can be with the turn over, and consistently good food. So let's give it to those cooks in the back as well. Those guys and gals are working so hard.  Tip well, people. Don't be so tight."}
{"text":"This Denny's is not a nice place to go to.  My husband and I decided today we would take our daughter to lunch on her lunch break from work.  When we got there we waited for ten minutes  before we ever saw our server again. She was getting ready to fill up the salt, pepper , jellies.etc.  I said are you are sever she says yeah you ready,  I said yes. We ordered she brought our food, never once came to see if anyone wanted a refill or desert . We had to go to the manager to get our bill.  did not leave tip and we always leave tip even if they bad, she was just horrible.  NO PEOPLE SKILLS, THIS PLACE HAS REALLY GONE DOWN HILL."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this Dennys twice in one week and it was a good experience both times. We love the holiday pumpkin breakfast.  The service was good. The place is packed full of people and we still got our food in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Stayed solid over the years with service and good food, like any restaurant it sucks when it gets to busy, but not enough to make you want to go somewhere else.  The meals at times are great tasting and some just right like my last time eating here, other times not so much."}
{"text":"I came here on Good Friday for brunch it wasn't packed or anything. We were seated almost immediately.   I ordered the classic eggs Benny and the eggs were poached to perfection. The hollandaise sauce however I found it to be a little bit too salty but I liked the thick texture. I wished they would service it with fruits tho.   Overall, it was an average experience but I will revisit this chain again. This place is more pleasant than Fran's. The atmosphere is more relaxing whereas I felt the environment at Fran's to be really chaotic and less privacy between tables."}
{"text":"My wife and I are retired and eat out every day.  There are only about 3 favorite places that we like going to, and this Denny's is our number 1.  We probably come here for lunch or dinner 4 times a week.  On the weekends, Ricky is our favorite server. During the week, Samantha is our favorite.  But, all of the servers are great, as well as the managers.  We are on a limited income and with the $1 Coffee and 20% discount from 4pm to 10pm using our AARP card - This is the most reasonable place to eat and we have several favorite menu items."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from here, so it's a favorite late-night spot when I feel like getting out of the house & stuffing my face with cheese fries. Service is usually fast & friendly, even when you roll in solo."}
{"text":"I would usually never review a chain such as this, but for a Denny's it was very clean the staff was friendly, the tea was fresh and the food was good for a Denny's. It is very much appreciated and I think the manger of this location should be promoted and training others how it is done."}
{"text":"The service was great! Our server shioda (something like that) very nice and attentive.   Food was a BIG NO.   ordered skillets they were dry, small and not good undercooked yet burned. Step your food game up Dennys I always try this location over and over and still disappointed. Train your cooks better. Do something please!! I love Dennys food and this location is closest to home and the food is always  trash. My hash browns were warm yet they tasted like old fridge food. Although the service is great it is after all a restaurant and truly deserves a one star for the kind of quality food. I didn't let my server know because I don't like complaining when they're trying their hardest and the kitchen is at fault."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Denny's in years, because I like healthy vegan food and they never had any.  But when I heard that they were offering a new veggie burger, I had to give it a try.   The menu started out, \"BETTER BURGERS Our hand-pressed burgers are served with wavy-cut French fries,  hash browns, seasonal fruit or dippable veggies.  Upgrade to seasoned fries for an additional charge.\"  \"Veggie Burger Amy's¬Æ Veggie Burger made from fresh organic grains and vegetables with protein-rich soy.  Topped with melted Pepper Jack cheese, fresh spinach, tomato and grilled mushroom on a wheat bun.  Served with a side of balsamic vinaigrette. 15 grams of fat or less when you select green beans or seasonal fruit in place of French fries.\"  I ordered the veggie burger with no cheese and a side of fruit.  My husband ordered the same with cheddar cheese and fries.  My order came out five minutes or more after his. We had to ask for mustard. There was no tomato on the burger. The burger itself was good, and the mushrooms and spinach were good, although most were not on the burger, but on the plate. But the bun!! It was as hard as a piece of balsa wood. Very unappetizing.  The bathroom was also dirty, which never speaks well for the kitchen.  I may try a Denny's again if there is absolutely nothing else around, but in Scottsdale, there are plenty of better options around. I won't be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was warm and the server had disappeared on us. Then two of their employees got into it over a free meal. One of the employees was trying to double up on his free meal. It was uncomfortable so we left and plan on not going back."}
{"text":"I usually hate going to Denny's but I was hungover and wanting a quick meal while staying off the strip. Our waitress TY was the sweetest ever! Brought everything out to us accordingly and even split the bill for us beforehand. Not to mention her amazing personality!!! I would honestly return just for her service!"}
{"text":"Best Dennys I've ever been at......Clean, friendly server, and all my food was made with love to perfection."}
{"text":"A free Birthday Slam on your birthday, just show government ID. Yay Denny's!  Consists of: - Pancakes - Bacon & Sausage - Two eggs  Our server was amazing - very nice sweet filipina lady."}
{"text":"Cashier (pregnant) was rude. She's the first and last person you see. She sets the tone for your visit. Asked for change and she shorted us a buck. Gave us a hassle because she \"can count right\". Its a dollar. I promise I'm not trying to take a dollar. When paying she was extremely rude. Why be there if your going to be unhappy and rude. Waitress was great!"}
{"text":"My waiter was very nice food was good seems like a very busy day is that must mean something I would eat here again when in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Sooooo.... I wrote another review for a Denny's in Payson (that was not shining) but it reminded me how awesome this one is.  We (my family and I) have been to this location probably 2 dozen times. There have been a couple of issues here and there but its always very clean, the help is always great and the food is always good.  Very consistent."}
{"text":"When I asked our waitress, Brittany, what she recommended on the menu, she told me that she didn't eat here and that she was very particular to her food. When asked about certain items she did not know what it came with, she was not knowledgeable about the menu at all. Clean place, not too busy around 8am. Good food!!"}
{"text":"found a new menu item  its a add on side for like $1.99 they are pancake balls  they are 100% the best new thing ever  will get them every time i go from now on"}
{"text":"Good food and service. It's Denny's, you know what you get here. For the most part it's cookie cutter to any other Denny's.  Worth the visit for a meal."}
{"text":"My Nephew is causing this one star, my nephew whom is only 16, was dragged along to Las Vegas although he is quite young there is a lot of entertainment attractions for whom are, so him and his little friends went to Denny's and they of course gave them a name and told them to wait... for a table of 3...   As time goes on 20-30mins they are starting to notice no attention at all and saw that they were seating a bunch of people... alot of table of 2 parties... However he mentioned to me that he was on the list and was waiting to be called.  Unfortunately he see's a party of 6 enter staggering around as if they were all intoxicated and went ahead and were seated before them.  So my nephew got up walked over to the counter and asked hey what's up and said what's your name \" his repsonse(his name) They said we don't see you on here. after waiting 30 mins....  Our relatives thought maybe they thought they were going to dine and dash.... I don't think so I just think they were mad that 3 16 year old kids are in Las Vegas about to be seated at Dennys with no parents..  Anyways 1 star for my nephew... they yelled screaming out of the restaurant... kids.... lol"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? This was THE worst service I've ever had in my life! If you don't mind waiting over an hour and having your order be incorrect then this is the place for you. Servers with attitude should be sent home, not left on the floor to ruin people's evenings."}
{"text":"I know, rating a Denny's 4 stars might seem like a little overkill, but I don't care  Only place in Brampton that I know of where I can get a fully loaded breakfast with pancakes and all the fixins at 2am and chase it with a pint of beer.  Love those hashbrowns!"}
{"text":"As good as a Denny's can get. The service was excellent - shoutout to our waitress Kanani. Everything was correct and brought out in a very timely manner. The food was great and cooked well.  Only area of improvement was that the bathrooms could have been a bit cleaner."}
{"text":"This Denny's used to be 5 stars in my eyes however I feel like they lost their luster. They used to decorate for holidays, they used to have servers who cared about your experience. Now it just seems like any other chain...Which makes me want to go elsewhere to get cheap breakfast food."}
{"text":"Sorry to burst your bubble Dawn G but this location just opened up maybe a week or two the most.  Service is ok, we lucked out and got a decent server.  Food is reasonable in terms of price but what you get is another story.  You get what you pay for.  The food wasn't filling, I left still hungry.    I had the cinnamon pancakes, I should have gotten the grand slam which for $3 more would have filled me.  I'd avoid the T-Bone steak for now, as someone else mentioned it wasn't very good.  First it was ordered medium well but arrived rare, it was sent back but then became well done.  Pot Roast looked good but the portion was tiny.  Apple Caramel dessert was good."}
{"text":"To reply to Kevin C's review. He is the GM at this Denny's he was so disrespectful to me, I didn't have any problem with any other employees..... Just you. First off yes me and him had a disagreement cause I felt that I was disrespected but no bodily harm Was threatened with. Second off they would sit all the african-Americans in one area. And some of the waitresses would argue about taking them saying that african-Americans don't  tip. I was going to this Denny's since I was 18 years old and have never had a problem. Food was for the most part always good."}
{"text":"Well, I'm writing this review while waiting to even place my order. Been here for about 20 minutes now, and doesn't look like anyone's coming yet.  Just sitting at the table drinking my water. Although they are pretty busy and there's only two people out assisting customers so I don't know.... Management needs to learn how to properly staff their store properly. How long will I be waiting tonight? Hah  Edit, right after I posted this review someone came and took my order so things are looking up, I added one star for that.  Edit2, a lady came and apologized for our wait so it's good that they're acknowledging they were having problems at the time. Seeing as I'm an Assistant Manager at another restaurant I know how important it is to make sure that's one of the first things you do during hard times, also I can hear someone in the back now yelling, and directing people so I can tell someone's trying back there to get everything back in order so I'm changing my review from 1 star to 4 stars for the comeback they made."}
{"text":"One of the better places that I've eaten in my time in Cleveland. A lot of reviews are negative in terms of customer service, but I found that to be largely untrue; our server was attentive and quick. The wait time for the food was slightly long but the quality of the food was well worth it. The bathroom was super clean as well as the restaurant itself. I recommend this location."}
{"text":"This is one of the weakest Denny's in the city. I am not sure if It's just this location in particular, but this one certainly has started to gip out on the portion sizes.  2-3 years ago, the amount of fries that one received was generous, as was hash browns, or chunky potatoes.  Not anymore. Maybe it's the recession, maybe they don't want to put prices up, but at the MacLeod Tr S Denny's the fries and hash brown portions are bordering on miserly. A handful or a little over.  I hear that all the Dennys is owned by the same family (Mamood or Muhammed or some name like that) that also own all the Sandman hotels in town. I'm not sure about the veracity of that, so maybe dig a bit yourselves.  If it is true, then the one owner chain in Calgary is inconsistent accross the city. The Denny's in the NW, at  crowfoot is easily the best one. The one on trans canada bolted onto a Sandman is also rather weak. Sometimes they are even closed overnight!  If you want basic, well done brekkie type food, then if all the Denny's start being miserly with the portions, then dare I say it, Humpty's (I know, not exactly sophisticated but it doesn't pretend to be anything else *cough* Joey Tomatoes *cough*) is still a good fallback, and if you can find one, Perkins."}
{"text":"I would have to agree with a few other posters, 1 from the states stating the portion sizes were a little small and both also saying the decor, although new and very nice, feels like one is in a supermarket.  Bright? I'll say!  First thing one notices about this Denny's in particular, is, if they got the lightbulbs any brighter, it would be a competitor for the Luxor in Las Vegas.  Tip to management, um, guys, chill out on the wattage will ya? It's not a laboratory! Either pull some light bulbs or turn down the dimmer a bit!!  I have been there with a partner on a few times, and the food, is good consistent Denny's benchmark every time, along with all the other Denny's. One knows what one is going to get.  BUT! It's either inflation, cost of materials, wages, business operating costs etc, as the portion sizes overall on most of the Denny's all over Calgary have started to border on miserly.   They have been shrinking these last several years. Back in 2004, when I first moved to Canada, it was a good amount. Now, a handful of fries.  Sure, inflation makes businesses adjust things. But how come Denny's in the US are still ginourmous portions?  And guys, what's with the agressive rap and hip hop at this location? Really? It's a restaurant, not a bump n grind club.  The final last straw for me not visiting Denny's if I can help it moment? Many (if not all) have TV's now.  Yes, really. Which genius thought of that? I'd like to meet him/her.  Sigh. And to think at one point, one could have a haven after a tough night shift for a quiet cup of coffee and wind down with ones work buddies.   Nope. Hockey on the TV,  (oooh, like you cant see it ANYWHERE else right?!?)  superstore lighting levels and drunken idiots crashing in at 1am at some restaurants.  The idiot lantern is slowly ruining everything.   Avoid.  Thank god for Humpty's and Perkins."}
{"text":"Great service, looks like new staff who know what their doing!"}
{"text":"The food was good, and for the most part the service was good as well except for our waitress Tammi. She was short with her sentences and a bit rude as well. We took a while to order which i could tell irritated her,  after we did order and get our food she rarely came back to see if we were doing alright. Now only that, but after our meal we ordered a dessert. It took at least 20 minutes to get back to us. I could tell that she didn't like us that much, but the customer service she showed us was horrible."}
{"text":"Had some great breakfast service. Spacious. Good pricing. Clean."}
{"text":"I don't know why the reviews were so low. It is a slow Denny's, at least the time we went. There were only a few people working there but the food was good. We had a burger and skillet. Both were really good."}
{"text":"This in not a review of the food at this Denny's but how they treated my wife and I. Decided to stop by this location before our road trip, of course it was packed, so we had to get on a waiting list.  No problem,  the hostess said it will only be about ten minutes. So the wife and I are patiently waiting to be called and anther couple walked in, I guess they where friends with the hostess because she told them she had a table for them. Now we been waiting along with a lot of other people for some time and because you are friends with someone that works their you get in right away.  I did speak up and she shrugged her shoulders at me, so we left. I no I'm just one customer and I guess Denny's had a lot of them but as of today I will never set foot in a Denny's again!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING service Our waiter Susan was quick, and so thoughtful with our 3 boys"}
{"text":"The service here sucks they didn't have anything on the menu and the prices are higher than a regular dennys"}
{"text":"I've driven past by this Denny's hundreds of times and yet, have only dined here once or twice. This was before their renovation and now after their grand re-opening, I'm sure I'll be visiting a lot more when in Sin City.  This location is the country's no. 1 cash generating Denny's restaurant. With it's prime spot on the strip for almost 50 years at the Best Western Plus Casino Royale, it's not hard to believe. The year-long renovation included a $9 million, 26,500 sq. ft., two-story addition that can be accessed via an escalator, adding room for almost 300 diners. Incredible, when you think about what the place looked like before.  My last visit was probably 10+ years ago with family. After spending time at the Circus Circus Midway playing games and winning stuffed animals, we were hungry. I don't remember much about the food we ordered and I'm surprised I even remember dining here at all really. All I can remember is thinking the place was old and dingy... which is probably why it was about time to remodel. I'm sure the food was standard as Denny's is a chain and their quality and taste is pretty consistent.  I'll admit that Denny's is a guilty pleasure of mine, so I'm excited to eat here again in the near future. Plus, White Castle is opening next door by late-2015. I can't wait."}
{"text":"Shovan is a great waitress.  We will only eat at her stations when we come here.  Always on her game."}
{"text":"Five stars just for the lovely bartender Kenia out front!!! We got mimosas while we waited for our table and she was absolutely wonderful! Thanks Kenia!"}
{"text":"All Denny's are supposed to give seniors a 20% discount and this particular Denny's said they've never given any discount to seniors. Boo Hoo Denny's!!!"}
{"text":"There is no eggs Benedict on the menu. Usually if it's not on the menu they can still make it for me but there is NO hollandaise sauce in the building. I had to order all-la-cart and build my own eggs Benedict without the hollandaise sauce. I ended up putting both poached eggs on One of the English muffins & jelly on the other half with jelly so it wasn't too bad of a breakfast but my point is...  Who in the hell doesn't offer Eggs Benedict or even have it on the menu! Answer!!! - DENNY's"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Asked for a few different items at different times and didn't receive one. Our drinks were not refilled. And had to ask for our check a couple of times. Get with it Dennys or you will be next to go bankrupt."}
{"text":"The food was standard Dennys food, so 3 stars usually. I'm taking a star off because our server was MIA and it took forever to order, and get refills or steak sauce. Granted, we went in the wee hours of morning, and were 1 of 2 tables in the place, but you would think that would make things easier on us. Guess she isn't in it for the money."}
{"text":"This was my Uncle Nicks favorite place and I have to agree, the food was always good. Thanks Debbie for taking care of my Uncle for all them years, you and your staff are the best in Monroeville PA!"}
{"text":"Giving a one star due to the fact that my order was 9 bucks. No biggies however I have 20 bucks. Told server right after I ordered here's 20. So u will have a 100 percent tip. She was nice. However didn't come check on me one time. And didn't even say thank you. So let's just say I will now be the avg tipper. Which means in less then 10 bucks. I will give 2 dollars. That's 20 percent. Shame on these people today. Seriously. I was a servers in my teens many years ago and busted my butt for back then 10 percent. To get 100 percent tip these days is beyond rare. Food was fine but it's the principle of not checking on me and not thanking me. #rude #dennys #wow"}
{"text":"I have loved Denny's for being open 24 hours. The  omelettes there are great. I like the Loaded Veggie one."}
{"text":"I was not pleased with this location, but didn't expect to be either.  My meal randomly came out at least five minutes before my friends did.  While I knew it wouldn't look as great as the picture on the menu, it looked nothing like that.  It tasted pretty bad, but I was starving so I managed.    I'll give them credit since they obviously put up with a lot and never ending crowds, but its still gross."}
{"text":"Got seated right away and the staff was very pleasant. One of the cleaner Denny's I have been to.  I ordered a burger, fries, and a shake and all were really good and cooked just right. Denny's has always been one of my favorite casual dining restaurants, so this one is worth a visit when you are in the area."}
{"text":"UUGGHHH! $2.25 for coffee? I should have gone to starbucks. I needed a table to fill out some paperwork and I did not want to sit in the car (but I should have).. My waitress was very nice, but this place is uh, dirty.. The blinds look like they have not been cleaned in FOREVER!! If I were eating there (never) I would have been more than a little freaked out. Yes it is a chain, so no points there, it is the same as the last time I had the misfortune of being in a Dennys..."}
{"text":"Called to order for pickup and they put me on hold for 5 minutes then when I called back it wouldn't go through. Also this location has terrible customer service. They are understaffed and particularly rude. This location is not even shown on the Dennys app. That says something."}
{"text":"Ok yes I know Denny's is a chain yada yada and therefore we must always be skeptical of these places. However, my experience this morning at this location was above and beyond, and left me thinking that this Denny's is kinda special.  Nothing amazing happened, its just that everything worked. Service was great. Food was consistently hot and good. I wanted to go back for lunch."}
{"text":"I like this Denny's. They call it \"the hidden Denny's\" because it's tucked in here behind the 147 near the airport and University. The Staff and managers here are great, you can tell its a well-run place. We all know the food, its good, it's Denny's."}
{"text":"The worst Denny's I've ever been too!!! Don't go here, drive the extra miles to a better location!"}
{"text":"Service was great but the food was not amazing... Definitely not as good as other Denny's"}
{"text":"Okay, so food was good. Just hated how dirty the restaurant is. It's kind of crazy that it was this dirty when there wasn't a lot of customers and staff just walking around or not even visible at all. This is my third time coming back here and I hoped maybe every time I came that things would change because I do love Denny's but, sad to say I won't be returning to this Denny's. wish them success tho."}
{"text":"So...its only two customers here including myself and I have to run the waiter down to get a second glass of OJ.  The other couple here even saw me trying to get his attention. I tipped him anyway but should not have."}
{"text":"Came here after the buffets we wanted to hit were packed with lines out the door.  The coffee cup I had still had lipstick on it (shivers), but Lupe was awesome and accommodating to our taste and we ended up happy customers."}
{"text":"While my waiter and hostess (on checkout) was friendly, fast and efficient, my breakfast (blueberry pancakes, eggs, sausage, hash browns, milk and OJ) could have been better.  My breakfast was delivered hot (yay!). But, the eggs were a bit dryer than I like, but at least they were eatable. That is, until I discovered that they had too much salt, as did the hash browns. Luckily, the sausage links were fine.  The pancakes were pretty good. But, they served them with regular pancake syrup (sorry, guys. But Blueberry pancakes demand blueberry syrup).  They were out of Apple Juice (2nd place in a row to be out :( ). So, I ordered a OJ. However, what was irritating was that they only had one size (large). So, not only did I waste money (nearly 1/2 the bill was for milk and juice), there was wasted juice (I only drink enough to take my vitamins).  Also, before breakfast, I went to the restroom to wash up. Well, it looked like it hadn't been clean in days (sink was dirty and used paper towels on the floor). But, after breakfast, I went in to use the restroom, and it had been cleaned up. So, I'm not sure if they do hourly checks, or not. But, at least it was usable when I needed it."}
{"text":"We were expecting the usual slow service but usually it's tolerable.We waited 35 mins as we watched the cooks go out for a smoke break.When we finally got fed up and ask to just pay for our drinks the waiter admitted to \"forgetting \" about us.Seems like the staff decide when they want to work there.Do yourself a favor and pass."}
{"text":"Frank said these are he best pancakes he has ever had!!! They are gorgeous! Better than the picture!!!! He said they are even better because I bought them!!!!   You're welcome Frank!"}
{"text":"Alright.. So to start it off the parking sucks here. Very much so .. Anyway my servers name was Ingris and she was great.. Another blonde woman refilled my coffee and took my initial drink order.. So it's always nice to see teamwork being implemented into service.. My food came out thirteen minutes after I ordered so that was a very appropriate time after I ordered.. I see some of the other reviews for this particular location and they're not very good.. Because of that I would've liked to see a manager poke his or her head out at least once to see how the patrons were doing.. Other than that I'd say I enjoyed my experience at this particular Denny's location .."}
{"text":"Went late-night Friday 8-4-17. Total shit-show. The place was filthy. Food was horrid. Worse than the IHOP across the street. Id give -5 stars if I could. I would rather sell my soul to the devil than eat here again."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good but bathrooms are disgusting!!!! I would like to think the kitchen was clean."}
{"text":"Bad no utensils to eat no syrup for pancakes.  Didn't want to honer web site deals . Not sure what's going on."}
{"text":"haven't had breakfast at a Denny's in quite a long time. I always like Denny's a bit more than IHop, mainly for the hash browns...Denny's are crispier, IHop's are mushy.   Either way you like them, I don't think I've ever had a bad breakfast at Denny's. This location is easy to get to, wasn't all that busy, a little surprising being that it was Sunday morning at 10 am. Service was outstanding though and food was good."}
{"text":"It's 2 am and you're hungry. That's what Denny's is for, right? Ok, maybe not all the time but that's what  this particular location is for me.   I've never had bad service here, the staff is always friendly and reasonably quick. The food, well, it's Denny's. No it's not AAA Mobile diamond rated but it almost always fits the bill...literally, because it's cheap too.  So thank you Mr Denny or whoever founded this American institution of road side fare, without this, millions of hungry late-nighters would be lost."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's that I've ever been to. I waited 10 minutes to be seated even though there were tables available then I ordered my food and it took 25 minutes then when they delivered my food they had the wrong order and pretty much says it was my fault because I probably said the wrong thing. Never returning."}
{"text":"So damn pathetic. The waitress was rude as hell and ha no skills in customer service. I ordered the double cheeseburger with fries and the serving of fries was small. I will not return here unless they change up how they work here."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this Dennys the customer service used to be amazing but it's not anymore. Every time I come I used to know all the servers but that's not the case anymore. The food is still good though so I guess that's what count now.."}
{"text":"Nice braunch ! Very friendly and affortable on your pocket ! So we can Play more ! Need to safe ! Good For groups or alone like me !"}
{"text":"The service is a joke , I understand breakfast is free for hotels guest but come on ignoring the customer because you think he/she is not gonna leave a tip is bullshit ! The fake ass rockabilly server maybe you should pay attention to your tables instead of fixing your lame ass head band all the time I've been staying at the hotel for a month now and every time I go in you ignore my table find a new job ! The phillipino guy is the only hustler there hats off to him"}
{"text":"WOW!, just unbelievable restaurant was not busy, sat and waited 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged us and took our drink order then our food order then we had to get our own silverware. Unbelievably bad service from a restaurant chain that I frequent.  Avoid this location at all cost."}
{"text":"If I could do a half star I would I got the worst service when I walked in after my gym session to go get one of their fit meals I just got out of the gym so I was still in my gym wear and they refuse me service because of what I was wearing not only did they refuse service they did not approach me and ask if I had a shirt in my car to cover up my sportswear they just refused service and yelled from a distance no shirt no service to where all the customers in the actual restaurant heard I've never felt so embarrassed and disrespected in my life I am a server myself and I will never ever do that to a customer the sad part is I liked other locations but because of this location I will never ever step foot in a Denny's ever again"}
{"text":"This Denny's was pretty good. The food taste good and the service was good as well. Restaurant was clean. Would go again."}
{"text":"We had a late dinner with the family after a baseball practice and at first it started rough maybe because the server seemed new but David the Manager was on his game. Kept attending all tables making sure we were happy even apologized that the food was about 30 minutes late. He gave us our military discount and amazing service. We will continued to go to this location. Just look and congratulate David the manager for his new position"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I thought I'd give this place another try, but was let down even more than before.  The waitresses were rude, and spent half their time talking about vacations, cell phones and how bad the managers are, all within clear hearing range of most of the guests.  My order took about 10 minutes to get (breakfast), but no toast.  The waitress said \"your toast will be right up).  By the time that I got my toast, my meal was almost finished.  BTW...I watched my toast sit under the heat lamps for about 5 minutes before my waitress had time to bring it to me,  so busy was she gabbing with the other waitress. My eggs, ordered over medium were so well done,  they could have been hard boiled.  My country fried steak was so overcooked that it actually was curling up, and the gravy just didn't taste like anything at all.  No one ever came to check on me, to see how my meal was.  I think they knew what I'd say......STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with changes from new management. Bacon paper thin no taste. In fact it may be microwave bacon. Pancakes are not the same and definitely not buttermilk. More like the instant ones from a box. I eat here often and always the same breakfast. Today it was nothing like the past. Waitress didn't come by once to refill our coffee."}
{"text":"Endia is such a great waitress! She helped me choose all the best foods and she's just great. Love, JerBear"}
{"text":"Denny's always provides a reasonably reliable breakfast and lunch type menu. I pretty much only go here for breakfast, which is quite adequate."}
{"text":"I would highly suggest finding elsewhere to eat,  we came for a late bite, maybe 8 tables total.  We waited over 30 minutes for food,  and when it came,  it was cold. The hashbrowns were still raw,  we asked for crispy bacon and it was hardly cooked.  When the server came by, we nicely explained that the food was disappointing and she offered to warm it up, thanks but no thanks.  No need to microwave. Needless to say,  we barely ate our meals. We got up to the register where the manager took 15% off our bill...i noticed that he just applied an \"AARP Meal discount.\" I explained that 15% is pretty sad when the entire order was cold, his reply was \"the cook,  Brian is doing the best he could.\" Really? Maybe a) the manager should roll up his sleeves and help Brian out and b) take responsibility for his position then blame someone who clearly needs more training. Meanwhile,  Its been a few hours and I'm nauseated so needless to say this place gets a big fat F rating."}
{"text":"it's Denny's, so the offering are pretty standard... but this location frankly sucks. There's no inexpensive parking nearby, and the service was beyond lacklustre - slow, inattentive, and served us stale biscuits. We went based on an irrational craving, and definitely shouldn't have bothered."}
{"text":"Good breakfast but if it gets busy you're food may take a while or it's cold or it's wrong. I've had mixed days when coming here."}
{"text":"If you want breakfast for two to set you back $40 plus tip, this is definitely the place for you. That said, you get prompt service, a broad menu, and a horrifying understanding of why Americans are so fat a,long with the deal. I don't know why I keep going here, some kind of Stockholm Syndrome."}
{"text":"Visiting from outside of town we were staying across the street at the holiday express... Good hot food clean location...  Can't beat the price.."}
{"text":"A roach crawled in our booth while we were eating last night. The manager came over, seen the roach, and said the bill on me and hope you come back. Ummmmm, no, lol. ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK"}
{"text":"I like Denny's. Shoot me. Their breakfasts are all good. I had the Bacon Caramel Shake, and it was shockingly good! I never thought Denny's would sell something like that. Good service as well."}
{"text":"Denny's. Who doesn't enjoy this restaurant for its breakfast.   The grand slams going strong still and menu selection is huge for breakfast.   Good rotation of menu items for Halloween, Christmas, etc.   Pricing is good and portions are about average.   Food is consistently fresh and well cooked at this location.   Staff is very friendly. Overall one of Calgary's best Denny's."}
{"text":"It is a Denny's.   Service is good and food is consistent.   This location was clean both in and outside.   Open 24 hours of course and fan of pancakes and waffles.   Overall no different then other Denny's around town."}
{"text":"Been a while since I gone to this Denny's.   Went here recently and the restaurant has undergone and completed renovations.   New signage and greeting area. All new floors and booths.   Still an old school dinner table counter near back of the restaurant.   Food prices are very good and portions as always are plentiful.   Kids menu is priced nice and Tuesday they have kids eat free from 4:00pm to 8:00pm.   Overall great food, great service and will be coming back."}
{"text":"We stoped here on a long road trip thinking \"well, it's Denny's. Sort like IHOP. Meh.\" this place was amazing. It was not your run of the mill crappy fake tasting food. Their whole wheat 9-grain pancakes were actually amazing! VERY good! Their eggs tasted like real eggs made with real butter! Quite unusual for restaurants like this- it's usually fairly flavorless and makes you wonder if they are actually using powdered eggs.   The club sandwich tasted like it came from a nice cafe, not a fast food breakfast place. Even the Caesar salad was amazingly good.  I would also like to say that our server Jacob did an excellent job as well. He was very friendly, just the right amount attentive, not annoyingly so, and very efficient. Great service, great food! Loved it and very happily surprised!"}
{"text":"What type of restaurant will not allow you to place an order for pick up? I called in this evening to place a sizable order.  The gentleman on the other end of the line told me that \"we cannot take orders to go or for pick up over the phone because too many people don't show up to pick them up\".  To provide resolution, I offered to pay by visa over the phone prior to pick up. He then retorted that they were unable to run a card by phone manually.  I understand that people may call in orders and never show, but for people that offered to pay prior to pick up, have a way to facilitate that in order to provide a service to the customer.  Because of this, this Denny's will never earn my business."}
{"text":"This Dennys is pure trash. We don't go to Dennys to expect great food but at least it should be hot. Our food was cold. We notified the manager on duty and she was unapologetic. Don't waste your money on this trash establishment"}
{"text":"Kidless for the weekend.. rode the tram back and forth, saw clubbers bobbin their heads like they were too cool for school.. glittery tube tops, guys in sweaters.. nothin cool on the town, so we had a whiskey and coke at home and headed straight to gay denny's. Ahh... so much more entertaining then the lame-o stilletto wearin, sweater vest kanye wannabe club scene. So many people around to people watch, interesting conversations to over hear. refreshing, really! I love you gay denny's. Especially when you are full of fire men. I was there that day, and you were beautiful."}
{"text":"Denny's is a great place to go at anytime of the day. It's open 24/7 everyday. They make breakfast, lunch, and dinner food items and they are amazing! I wish they had more vegetarian options but they do have a few. The food is OKAY. I've had better but it it's not bad or horrible. It's okay. The menu is full of desserts, appetizers and main meals! The food is relatively decently priced. The place is spacious and the waiters are friendly. It's also clean and very organized."}
{"text":"Horrible. For of us ate and out of our 4 orders we found out that they was out of coke, chili, tator tots, and possibly Swiss cheese because our sandwich had cheddar instead of Swiss. Their onion rings also tasted like fish. It was the worst service I ever had eating anywhere."}
{"text":"It's Denny's, so with their food you get what you pay for, but their customer service is better than most of their other locations. Our sever was a middle aged woman and was very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"Came in for coffee,  eggs and chicken sausage.    I have never been to the  Danny's in  Champaign but go often in the Chicagoland area.   Jessica my waitress was awesome,  however the kitchen.... Sigh.   The kitchen... I don't eat pork and always get chicken sausage,  I am sure the Cook smelled the bad sausage when they there cooking it,  yet still served it.  Thanks you to the wait staff for the quick correction."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Denny's, nothing ever changes on their menu.  Veggie omelet with hash browns, cheap easy, fast.  I don't always leave feeling very healthy though.  I was in a rush to get some lunch, and the person I was with wanted Denny's, the Wild Wild West Casino was the closest Denny's to us......soooo it was the way we had to go. GROSS, smokey, trashy, not very comfortable.  I left smelling like cigarets. The service was nice.  We had let are server know we were in a rush and she happily obliged and got the food out in a timely manner.  I won't ever go back to this location, it was just too trashy, too much smoke, and really loud."}
{"text":"The server was terrible here.  She got the orders all wrong, try to save us money by including my meal with someone elses when that person clearly wanted all four of the things in the deal he was getting. Clean location, but bad service."}
{"text":"Because we have a kid, we frequent Denny's and are known by name at our local one so we thought we'd get a quick meal while staying in Downtown Vegas. We were greeted by a friendly host and sat immediately.  15 minutes later, we had not been greeted.  My husband checked in with the friendly host who apologized, took our orders and brought us drinks. 10 minutes later a server walks up to retake our order because the host \"didn't ask the right questions\".  Um...right...we gave him the same order we gave the host (we're Denny's pros...we KNOW how to order).  The kid apologized profusely, several times, but I negotiated our stay with a free milkshake because at this point, I was about to walk out.  When we finally got our food we were like, \"um...where are the fries?\" I mean, there were like six there, but again...Denny's pros here, we know what to expect... He tried by bringing out more fries but at that point, we were a little put out.  An hour later, we were finally out the door.  We thanked the host and found out that he GOT IN TROUBLE for taking our order and trying to make things right.  He was the only one who understood \"service\".    I get that this is \"just\" Denny's, but this wasn't even the minimum.  Note: This was New Year's Day, I can only imagine the hangover these kids had."}
{"text":"A very negative experience at this location.  I usually frequent the location at Courtney Pk & Hurontario...which has the same owner operator as this location.  I arrived at about 1 am on a Thursday night and I was the only person in the restaurant.  I was seated immediately and my drink order was taken right away. The server (probably the manager, as he was dressed in a suit), took my drink order.  He returned very quickly and took my food order which was the Prime Rib & Chicken Skillet.  He headed directly to the kitchen and began to make my order.  At this point I realized he was the only employee in the restaurant as far as I could tell.  People began to show up at the door.  Then it was obvious my server/manager was running the show alone.  My order arrived and most of it was burned.  No tortillas, sour cream & pico de gallo.  I sent it back.  20 minutes later my order arrived.  The tortillas were cold and only the hash browns were burned this time.  I asked for a pop re-fill and the bill, to save the server trips to the table as he was obviously overwhelmed.  My re-fill came a few minutes later but no bill.  I asked for the bill once again & one more re-fill.  This time both came together. I finished my pop and took a look a glance at the bill. I was charged for my meal and 2 pops.  I called the server over and he informed me it was the restaurants policy to provide 1 free re-fill only!  Silly me....and I thought bottomless meant.....bottomless.  I left exact change....something I've never done before.....and will never return to this location.  It is inexcusable to not have at least 3 employees at any time.   The Mississauga &  Whitby Denny's have always met my expectation....nothing spectacular but decent.  The Brampton location is hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"Hard to believe I'm giving a Denny's a four star review but I'm not comparing this to fine-dinning.  This is a chain diner after all.  A very friendly greeting from the hostess and I was seated immediately.  This location has Wi-Fi and the hostess bought me the key code right away as she saw I had a laptop.  She looked to be very young but boy was she on the ball.  Impressive. The waitress...also very friendly.....took my pop order....it was 2:30 am & too late for a beer.  I surfed the web for bit and had one more re-fill before I ordered.  I had the Ultimate Skillet.  You could see the steam coming off the skillet when my order arrived.  Tasted fresh.  The server offered me hot sauce which I accepted.  A nice touch to make sure I  had everything I needed.   The food exceeded my expectations.  For a late night meal and the Wi-Fi has made me a fan.  I've been back many times since.  I joined the Denny's rewards club and I've received several 20% off coupons as well a voucher for $10 of food for signing up.  Nice job at this location."}
{"text":"Good service, but terrible food.  My dinner date ordered ala carte stuff and here's the digs: 1 Egg Over hard: Egg was so over cooked that the yolk part was cooked to a state of nonexistence Smothered hash browns: teeny plate of hashbrowns with invisible cheese, shit tons of onions, a tablespoon of \"gravy\" (looked like jizz), and had no flavor Pancake puppies: Dry as shit, not warm, and were like weak ass donut holes Toast: Half buttered and barely toasted  My bacon/avocado bfast burrito was ok.  The worst part was the passed out homeless person outside the building that was so dead to the world that he had about 40 flies buzzing around his nose and mouth. In fact, we checked his breathing because he looked dead. Not appealing for outside of an eating establishment, even if it's las vegas.   Do not give this place your money or time. Maybe the other Denny's on the strip are better, but the one by the Stratosphere is pure shit."}
{"text":"When you get to Vegas and find out that the buffets are NOT cheap, do yourself a favor and head to Denny's! You won't be alone...  After laughing at the $55 for two breakfast buffet in the hotel, my girlfriend and I headed over to Denny's for some cheap eats. We arrived to throngs of people with the same idea. Regardless, our wait time was less than 20 minutes, and being attached to Casino Royale, we found ways to pass the time. : )  This is very much your typical Denny's. I had the grand slam (or one of their \"slams\", can't remember which in particular), but with the cranberry orange pancakes instead of the plain kind. Delicious!! My only complaint was that my sunny side up eggs were a little on the undercooked side. Not salmonella undercooked, but could've been just a little more...  The staff were extremely efficient considering how crazy busy it is here. Not to mention friendly!   Next time you're in Vegas, skip the pricey hotel crap and dive into Denny's!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Denny's last Friday night. It was pretty empty. It was around 6 pm. My husband had the bacon Gouda burger. It was huge and juicy. He had spicy fries with it. He also ordered the chicken soup. The soup was freshly cooked. Nice and hot. My husband said it have used a little more spices. But he loved the burger. I had the 55+ club sandwich. Just the right size for me. My side was the fruit bowl. The sandwich was delicious. The fruit bowl had grapes, apple slices and a partial banana in the shape of a dolphin.  We were very happy with our experience."}
{"text":"Lumberjack Slam pretty good deal for the food you get. Service was excellent and fast. Just wish I had find out about the 5.99 Slam."}
{"text":"Jo is out favorite server. She gets five stars. Unfortunately, the screeching hostess who greeted us at the door, and the rude manager shushing the servers when they would explain something to the cooks through the window were more than irritating.   I don't know what it is about businesses lately, but they all seem to think they need to post someone at the door to scream at me when I walk in.   And managers who work with their employees are more effective than those who lord over them."}
{"text":"Standard Denny's. It tends to get crowded in the morning, I went on Sunday and had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. All I have to say is: 2 for 1 mimosas. #win"}
{"text":"Just horrible. Literally within the 1st 30 minutes they had 4 people walk out. All in the section we were in to. Michelle was our server, she was nice. But i feel the resturant was ran ridiculous. They were very shirt staffed it looked like and Michelle looked like she was doing a little of everything amd way more then she was suppose too while a bunch of the other workers just stood around and talked and bullshitted which caused the wait time to be so long just to get asked what we wanted to drink. One guy in particular who had this little Nicky hair cut I couldnt read his name but all he did was talk to this busser and lounge around. I also noticed the older busser guy had left the bin of dishes from the table he cleaned on the table and when the little Nicky hair cut guy went and pit these people at the table all he did was move the bin. Didnt bother wioing the table down after. Discusting. This place was unorganized. Wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Waited 5 minutes before being greated.  Waitdress Dezi was quick and polite, however food didnt come at the same time. Had to change my order twice because they didnt have the food. I settle for a turkey, lettuce, tomatoe sandwhich that took 5 minutes longer then the skillet and nachos my family ordered. And there was no lettuce or tomato  on the sandwhich. Come to find out. They were out of that also. So I paid $10.95 for a warm lunchmeat turkey amd cheese sandwhich.  Should have just gone to subway."}
{"text":"As I always aspire to be, I'll be fair in starting this review off with a nugget of honesty. My friend who I was eating with when I went here asked me during the meal why when asked if things were ok by the waiter/waitress and it wasn't, why we almost always reply that it is? My answer was along the lines of \"Because we're Canadian and that's how Canadians do it\" which due to our passive aggressive tendencies, I'm afraid is true, but I also added that if I didn't think the poor quality of a meal was an anomaly and it was due to the food being the way it was supposed to be and me simply not liking it, then I wouldn't complain because I'd never be back. I think you can see where this is going.  The service was pretty good. The waitress in our section was covering too many tables and I could tell she was tired, so I won't hold that against her and as I said, she was still friendly. I think this is a family run franchise and so I'll also say stuffing may be limited because they're trying to keep costs low. Anyhow, that's not the issue.   It's Denny's, I get it, but the Slamburger I ordered had so little flavor in it that I wondered if I had turned off my tastebuds. It seems like it should be a good combo: bacon, hash browns, egg over easy and a burger patty, but it's got nothing to it. I added salt and pepper on the patty and it was better but this was the blandest burger I'd had in awhile. The fries are okay, a weird crinkle cut steak fry but tasted okay. The rest was awful.   I didn't complain because as previously mentioned, this is how I feel it was meant to be. It's odd because the patty looked freshly made and like it would be flavorful but it wasn't. The bun was too weak to hold this much food. It had no sauce to make it tastier either.  Unless you're stuck at 4am and can't make the distance to Some other burger joint, I'd take a pass on Denny's."}
{"text":"Ilove Denny's, and this location didn't disappoint. Courteous staff, very clean restaurant and great food. Really recommend."}
{"text":"Not bad here.   SERVICE: Pretty good. The guy remembered all our orders and we got complicated \"whole wheat\" \"no tomatoes\" \"extra onions\"... I did not get my extra onions tho... :/ But they were great and split all of our bills in the check so each person can pay individually... that was a plus!  FOOD: I got a veggie mushroom cheese burger... very good. Fries were good too. I love mushroom! It was breaking apart but it was still good.  PARKING: Walking distance from stratosphere and tons of parking avaliable  LOCATION: Near ghettoish area but eh  Overall: Not bad for a Denny's... I liked it."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. I have never came to Denny's in Vegas nor will I ever come back. Ordered drinks and it took forever to get our drinks. We finally had to ask the manager for our drinks. We are still waiting for our food and its literally been 50 minutes. The server brought out my husband and my food but not our 6 year old sons. What restaurant serves the parents before the kids."}
{"text":"We like this Dennys as it is on the larger size and never feels super crowded. The food is typical Dennys and the service about the same. We have never had a big problem at this one and we continue to eat there. They also have many tables in addition to booths if you are unable to get in and out of a booth easily."}
{"text":"After returning from Prescott, AZ late at night (2am), I stopped at this Denny's location for a Cali-Club sandwich and a banana split. I sat down at the \"bar\" seats and tried to order my food.  As the waitress was trying to listen to my words, the cook suddenly started blaring VERY loud music from the kitchen. It was so loud, the waitress and I couldn't hear each other.  All of the waitresses tried to tell the cook to turn down the music, but he yelled and glared at the waitresses too. Even when I moved from the bar area to a seat on the other side of the restaurant, the cook continued to be rude, obnoxious, and anti-social to everyone in the restaurant (including the 2 waitresses). The simple order of my Cali-club sandwich was served with most of the ingredients missing! I decided to skip the banana split and leave. In the parking lot, I noticed that someone had left their interior cabin light on, so I returned inside to let them know.  It turned out to be the cook's vehicle AND he was parked illegally in a handicap space. (This area has a very high population of elderly and handicap so that was REALLY not cool) This Cook guy was SO bad and obnoxious to everyone, someone even called the police on him. I found it interesting that despite the fact that my entire order was wrong, I was still charged the whole price.  The next day, I made a dedicated trip back to the Denny's to speak with the manager, \"Manny\", and while he did tell me that \"he was aware of the situation\", he never once even apologized for my experience. Frankly, I don't think he cared. Bad management and criminally mental cooks plague this Denny's so beware! (Btw, rumor has it that the rude and obnoxious cook also works at the Grand Ave location in Surprise too so you might want to avoid that one as well!) I do really feel sorry for those two waitresses on duty that night.  They did try very hard to overcome the terrible behavior of the cook, but to no avail."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice but we waited for our food for at least an hour and a half. This is the first time that something like this has ever happened to us."}
{"text":"Wow, wasn't expecting much from dennys but holy cow. I sat at the bar, the service was subpar. 1 star for the cook in the back. Slamming plates down, complaining the whole time, just a bad attitude overall. Gave me anxiety just sitting there listening to her bad energy. Food was Danny's quality."}
{"text":"Food seemed to be good service ok went there cause wanted to see a place that I went to when I was a child over thirty years ago lots of  sick people in there woke up this morning with head cold was coughed on intentional makes u wonder what else is going on in there"}
{"text":"The best \"Moon over my hammy.\" Enjoyed breakfast so much. Food delivered at the perfect temperature. Coffee was hot and the manager very professional. Two thumps up for the kitchen chefs/cooks."}
{"text":"It's not infrequent that I'll stop in for breakfast as they're a tad quieter than other busier diners in the area.   Usually everything's consistently mediocre. Your server will eventually appear...it just won't be when you were seated. Food is consistent, which is a positive. When you're ready for another cup of coffee or need more cream, they'll eventually stop by...eventually.  It'll take about 10 minutes for the cashier to wander up after you've been standing there unhelped for awhile.   Yup...it's good enough for what it is if you're not in a rush."}
{"text":"Typical Denny's experience. What I don't understand is why is the menu so complicated? You can't find a \"build your own omelette\" or short stack anywhere. Otherwise, the servers are really nice at this location. One of the only brunch spots in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Worst food and service ever, it was clear white people weren't welcome. Every table that was non-caucasian and were seated after us got their food 1st. Waitress screwed up two of 4 orders after we waited for 45 mins. The table of Hispanics who were just seated received their food in 10 min. All had same waitress. She went around and visited with all the Hispanic tables joking and laughing, she never came back to the table. We wont be back."}
{"text":"It's Denny's. It's fomulary kinda diner food. We went because if you show your wrist bands from Great Wolf Lodge, you can either get 20% off your total bill or your kids can eat free. I did the math and it works out to about the same. My first cup of decaf was acidic sludge but our waiter kindly made me a fresh pot. Our waiter was nice enough. The French Toast was pretty darn good and so were the scrambled eggs. Solid place to get a cheap meal."}
{"text":"This is the only 24/7 place serving mainstream food so my friends and I come here often. We entered here at 3:20am. It's 4:07am right now and there's no server in sight. There's one server who keeps walking past and tells us that \"your server shall be here soon\". That's been said four times already. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Veranyca is one of the absolute best servers I've ever had. Made my entire night, and almost made me glad that the truck's tire blew out, that I had to stop by there next to discount tires. Talk about customer service, Veranyca took it above and beyond!"}
{"text":"its cheap breakfast food but the food is always.. just ok or cold... i always have a problem here. the staff is helpfule though"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a late night meal. Service is always great. This location is always exactly what the Denny's experience should be like. Food is quick, dining areas and restrooms clean, servers friendly and responsive. Perfect place to get a low stress meal and enjoy the company of friends and family. PS. The Dulce Pancakes rock!"}
{"text":"Amazing service(Erin, Anthony, Krista, Brenda, Jessica, Ren√©e), delicious food, great management (Nacho, Jennifer, and Mike)."}
{"text":"We stopped by here last night around 3am after our last Indian Festival. I couldn't believe it was packed at midnight/early morning. We entered through front door and we were helped right away. They were socked because couple of us were wearing traditional Indian dress in middle of the night but than comes the other crowd from same festival so we felt like home.  We ordered our drinks and she brought it right away, we didn't have had time to look at the menu so we looked up right quick and ordered food. I ordered my midnight breakfast \"Spanish omelet\"  and I was full. Our service was super but our food came little late.   I would definitely recommend this place specially for midnight craving"}
{"text":"We had a family outing two Saturdays ago and wanted something quick and good. Since we were out by Denny's we decided to stop there. As soon as we entered all the ladies was telling me how adorable my 4 year old son is. They seated us and gave us some time to look over the menu. We ordered our food, my son got pizza and apple slices, my fiance got buffalo chicken salad and me a new menu item (since they no longer sell the wing dings I loved) chicken Philly melt (it was so good very yummy). They gave my son free ice cream and we got build your own sundae it was very good! They got rid of the chocolate cake I loved so much that was a disappointment because I really had taste for chocolate cake. The staff was friendly and nice, we most def go back again. Plus, they want to see my son again. He is so adorable, dimples and all. :)"}
{"text":"So we walk in at Dennis and we get seated in a booth and I never ever in my life seen a waitress that seats us and she wipes down the tables with her bare hands and tells us to go and have a seat. We look at her and said you need need to wipe the table down with a rag so she back and does that and leaves the rag on the next table by us. The moral to the story don't come to this Denney to eat espically if your waiters wipes down the table with her hands."}
{"text":"\"It was okay\". The waitress barely spoke any English and did not seem to be very familiar with the restaurant she worked for at all. To confirm, we asked her if Dennys was still doing the all you can eat pancakes. She says \" no we don't have\". We show her the menu where the \"AYCE\" pancakes are. She says \"ok you want\". Sure. I ordered a skillet. She asked how I wanted my eggs and I said poached. She says \"we don't do\". Um ok it says right here on the menu which ways a customer can have their eggs prepared and poached is on the list. She doesn't say anything so I tell her just have them over easy. I tell her to please add broccoli to my food and no meat please. She says \"we dont do\". I told her I didnt understand. She said she would talk to the cook. She never returned with answer but I did get it prepared how I wanted (besides the eggs) and it was SIZZLING. She did not offer refills. We got our food in a timely manner and it tasted great. Sitting next to Joe Jackson was also a plus."}
{"text":"Terrible service today. I sat down at 2:40 and the food didn't came out until 3:25. Wow!!!! Very unacceptable. I don't usually have any problems eating at Denny's but today made me upset and I am not going to this location ever again. And made me pay for my meal."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty new and the physical structure itself is clean and in good repair. Ironically, I love how American restaurants like to come to Canada and put maple leafs on their logo and say things like we're \"Canada's diner.\"  We came here on a holiday and there was only one other table. The service was actually quite good, but the food was really poor. Unfortunately, we paid to upgrade to ham, and the ham that we received was practically inedible. Everything basically ranged from inedible to so-so. We left never wanting to return."}
{"text":"If it weren't the brand name of \"Denny's\" bringing people in this place it would have shut down long ago. This was like no Denny's I've ever gone to before which is usually prompt and the staff lighthearted making your visit enjoyable. But on this occasion I came in around 12 at night for a quick meal figuring it would be a quite and less busy. I was surprised by one large group so I understood the kitchen may be backed up. I ordered a grand slam and coco promptly to get it cooking. I got my coco and expected a little wait but then the longest and most frustrating waiting game began. 20 Minutes went by, no food, no waiter, no acknowledgment of me whatsoever. At this point I pull out my laptop figuring I can get some work done while I wait, 10 more passed. Then the waiter comes to apologize for the wait and it's \"Coming right up.\" 20 Minutes after that ( no exaggeration), it's still not here and I begin to pack up and stand just as the kitchen dings their bell for ready food. So I think \"Fine, I've waited this long I'll stay and eat.\" Even though my blood sugar is low and my blood pressure is up at this point. And then I can't believe it, the food was for the table that came in 15 minutes after me! Exasperated but calmly I ask him where my food is and he says \"coming right up.\" Yeah heard that one before. But he does go and grab it. He apologizes again, I say I'm not even upset at him it's nothing he has control over but an hour is ridiculous. He explains my ticket had gotten lost behind the printer! What are the odds. He said of course they'd do something with my check for the inconvenience after waiting a whole hour for my food! I ravenously ate my food. It was typical for Denny's. Asked for my check, he took his sweet time getting that too like I hadn't waited long enough. I nearly lost my mind when the check was still $8.68, they had only given me a small discount that didn't even cover the cost of the coco. I was infuriated at this point but I'm not the type to raise a voice or make a scene so I head to the payment counter to wait to pay and discuss the awful quality of service which would have saved them from this review and a letter to their corporation. But again I was completely blown off while he waited to his tables. After 5 minutes of standing at the front I just could not do it anymore and left my $9 cash on the counter top. WORST experience of my life at this Denny's. Will never be back. Will never recommend to anyone to even bother in their most desperate of hunger pains. Try any Denny's in the 5 mile radius just not this one."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disgusted with my last experience here on Saturday 12/9/17. When I first called to place my order with the unpleasant server by the name of DANIEL, I should have known it would go downhill from there..When I arrived to pick up my order I was missing 2 food items. When I mentioned it, this dimwit started to argue with me rather than simply look in the bag & resolve the issue. On top of that, he stated there was nothing he could do about replacing one of the to go lid covers that wouldn't stay closed. To cut a long story short, I asked for a manager after a heated 5 minute exchange and he walked away stating he didn't have to serve me! A manager, Ms Tammy resolved the error but didn't jump in initially to end this rude & unprofessional exchange soon enough. I overheard a waitress state that this server should have been let go a while ago..meaning he's done this before! Unbelievable!! I'll be making sure to follow this up in other ways including using the social media platform, because it truly was an unbelievably shocking customer service experience."}
{"text":"well, let me say i was stupid enough to go back to this same location but over a year later after 3 of my 4 family members got sick, including my 89 year old grandmother!!!!!    i just got home from dennys at 5161 w. thunderbird rd.  and let me say i know now how my entire family got sick the first time.....  i ordered the 8 oz steak that was clearly a 4 oz steak but that could be the people who supply the food.  when i got my food i had broccoli with it, one bite and i could hardly eat it but did as not to be rude in front of my husband and spit it out, although we have been together 25 years so it would be ok, haha.  the  next as bad as the first, so i spit it out and made my husband try it and he did the same.  however all but two bites of my steak were gone and the waitress had to finaly be flagged down not because she was helping other customers but because all the staff was sitting around up front talking and not paying a bit of attention to the 4 tables that ventured in this place to get sick!!!!!   mind you it was a little late, a whole 9:30 pm.  i told the waitress and had her bring me a salad, we ate the entire whole rest of the meal and never did she come back until flagged down for the check, which even with the crap food we still left 20%.  i go to register and long behold its the manager elizabeth carr, i say it again elizabeth carr, so if you see her, your in mager trouble....  i told her about the broccoli, which my husband and i both have been in the food businesses for 23 years and still are, he a manager  and my self an assistant manager at 2 different places and would have never not come to a table if the guest had a problem, very unprofessional!!!!!  she proceeded to tell me that it wasnt freezer burn,( which it was ). get this,  tell me if you catch it??  she said and i quote \" the broccoli isnt frozen, its fresh, we prepare it fresh daily, we chop it our selves\". i said well im just telling you maybe you should taste it, i just dont think you want to serve that to your customers.  she says \" well, its like the coffee, some people like it,  some dont\".    i said well, it taste freezer burn.  i said maybe, where it is in a regular cooler??  she says \" nope, not that when it comes in frozen we put in in the freezer right away....  did you catch it????  first it was fresh, they chop and prepare it their selves, and not its frozen!!!!  so here i say, you said its fresh, she says quite literary,  \" um, um, um, um,  well its frozen first, then it thaws, then we freeze it\".  what????  if you work in food you never thaw and then refreeze,  the heath department might like to know by the way, because its unsafe practice..  people get sick, example why i should have never gone back, but that was stupid on my part...  i would have yelled for the other people,  not to  eat there had i figured it would get me through to her, looking back i should have because they are going to kill somebody!!!!  if they thaw and refreeze, dropping it on the floor would be no problem to them either, or maybe they scratch something without washing their hands is probably ok to them too!!!!!   gross, but probably true!!!!  so you have been warned, eat at your own health risk, you should buy life insurance first and then i will send flowers to your funeral and a sweet sympathy card that says i told you dont eat there you poor smuck!!!!  as for me, never ever will i eat there again in a million years, and oh yes, monday morning bright and early i will be calling the district manager and maybe 3 tv, to see if this is normal practice...  which i can tell you it is.   dont ever, ever eat here, beware you have been told!!!!!!  by the way, her name is elizabeth carr!!!!"}
{"text":"Way over priced for subpar. I ordered simple chicken fingers and they tasted like they were microwaved. Also found chunks of cartilage. Fucking gross, I'll stick with IHOP"}
{"text":"When I visit any Denny's all I expect is OK food and not much of service. This one surprised me today.  When we walked in on a rainy morning today the place was packed. We were promised a table in 10 mins.  We were offered a table in 5 mins.  Lesson 1: Under promise, over deliver.  Everyone was wearing a smile on their faces and that was awesome. Smile is contagious. 5 stars for that.  The busser who was bussing tables on our section was fantastic. She was like a super woman, had an eye for detail but quick at the same time.   She offered to take our order and pass it on to our server and she did a great job at that. She deserves to be  promoted as a server.   Our server was great too. When she came to check on us I was finishing up my coffee and immediately offered a refill. 5 stars for that.  The entire experience was great. It shows that someone at the top is doing a great job and the entire team takes pride in their job.  Keep up the good work.  We will be back.  P.S: the hash browns did not smell of a dirty griddle and recycled frying oil as it normally does at other places. Thanks for keeping the griddle clean."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with the fact that the 2 Stars is not for this Restraunt. In fact, on cleanliness and service, I would say we're 3.5 to 4. The pancakes were good, until you got to the middle and found it was still batter.  The service was good. The good not so much. So why am I here? My mother wanted pancakes.    Here's why Denny's (as a whole company) sucks: they are too cute with their menu. Could I just get a simple order of pancakes and eggs?  The menu is full of all sorts of menu items that have added sugar and crap. Do I really need waffles with s'more? Why do my pancakes have to look like the Stay-Puft marshmallow man just jizzed all over my plate? Can I get a simple chef's salad? No! But I can serve you some Oriental salad with added crap that can clog your arteries. 9 pages of sheer crap. Simplify the menu. Make it simple diner food. Stay away from being cute. We are already a nation of over-weight diabetics. Quit adding to the problem. Focus on a few good items and be excellent at that and drop the crap that makes you mediocre (at your best)."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast today to start our New Year's eve off!  Shannon was the best waiter!  service was great food was great can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Wanted something simple to eat on the strip. Was with wife, kids, and in-laws. Out of seven orders, three were correct. Only took like 15 minutes to cook, but then it sat under the holding lamps for another ten minutes so it was nice and cold. My wife ordered a grand slam. Eggs were wrong, bacon was wrong( supposed to be turkey bacon) and got hash brown instead of pancakes. In other words was completely wrong. Had to suggest to the manager to take something off the bill. Should have been free, but got half off. Manager was extremely apologetic, but didn't want to lose the sale. Other than that, food itself was bleh. Overall horrible experience. Expected better from Lenny's, I mean Denny's. Received 1 star because I had to put one."}
{"text":"Usually can't mess up breakfast too bad. What was made was half-way decent. Problem was the order was wrong. Asked for White Chicolate Chip Pancakes. Got regular. Asked for extra sausage on my lumberjack breakfast instead of ham. Messed that up too. Smh. Better than my last Denny's experience though. Wish there was a 24 hour place better. Vegas needs an Eat N' Park."}
{"text":"4 stars for the staff 2 stars for the food. 1. We had to ask for hot coffee. 2. The oj was watery ( no credit to our tab given). 3. Bacon was hard and had an after taste. I have been to several Denny's but this one will not see me again.  **** too bad cause the staff was so friendly"}

{"text":"This place has the best tasting regular cups of coffee in town. I eat here for breakfast atleast once a week. Service is inconsistent and so is the food. Some days my hash browns and eggs are cooked perfect and some days they're soggy. The food always comes out super fast. I usually order the Red, White, and Blue Slam when they offer it."}
{"text":"Just wanted to put in a good word for this place.   I have breakfast here often.  The poached eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast each are always perfectly done.   Lunch and dinner is very good experience as well."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple: long wait to order our food, burnt pancakes, and food that is not worth the amount of money they want you to pay. I feel like my skillet was just a frozen packet and they just heated it up on the grill. This is probably the last time I will stop into a Denny's."}
{"text":"I really like this Denny's. The staff is friendly and the food is good. Always a good go to place when you want a nice atmosphere. The staff is very hardworking. Just never had an issue there at all compared to some in the neighbourhood"}

My friend was outside getting sick from the heat and she came and grabbed us to tell us they had water bottles for sale in Denny's and she helped us grab one to get back to our friend quickly. It was really sweet and helped us so much."}

Long waiting line,  20 mins to get seated at a dirty tables, it takes another 20 minutes to be acknowledged by a server,  another 15 minutes for the food to come,  food is not appetizing. My sons favorite food is pancakes and he didn't even want to touch his food.  Food is horrible and service is beyond poor."}

{"text":"Everything was too salty and my salad lettuce looked a week old. They need to weed out the mushy wilted lettuce out even if they have to serve at 1/2 serving. I couldn't eat it after seeing them in front of me. I felt bad for the waitress who's trying so hard & cook is ruining the tip. My family said bread was the best. Yaeeks."}
{"text":"I have four kids with me who are starving. Went to an iHop first where we waited at least 5 minutes and no one even came to greet us or even give us water so we left. Hit this Denny's up and we were in and out. Everyone was friendly, service was great and fed four kids and myself for about $30. Definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Ah Denny's AKA Jenny's has been a mainstay of the gay community for the wee hours of on weekends for a many a bar fly who wanted to satisfy that big girlie appetite after a night of dancing and playing. and I write:  Jenny you satisfy me so much, your waitstaff and management know exactly what to expect from us and we know what to expect from you. I have always, save once, recieved excellent service from you (Mind you I worked at a Denny's before) and your staff work wonders to get the food out fast.  You know how to put up with our antics and know when we are joking or when we've had enough, and your cute policeman on weekends is a nice addition.  Jenny's when they painted you Brown instead of your usual green with those red and yellow flags, my heart sank thinking you had succumbed into an awful Del Taco, but no you just tried to re-invent yourself with a makeover--although absolutely none such as we gays would ever do, of course definitely a straight make over.  You change your crowd to normal, boring in the mornings, but at night we get to see you show your treasure trove of goth kids, Wal-mart degenerates, bikers, twinkies and Queens,  Jenny's, I love you!!!!"}
{"text":"Very rarely do I frequent Denny's during the daylight hours. Therefore, I always see the same waitress at Denny's. I actually do not know her name, but I only know the fact that she works in the wee hours of the morning. (3 am ish maybe??) Normally, I do not rate Denny's very high, but I feel that this location and this waitress warranted a four-star rating. ( not 5 though..let's not get too crazy now) The food is as it usually is- not too bad, though nothing to write home about. However, even at 3 in the morning, that waitress always has a huge smile on her face and is always cracking jokes at us. When I do feel like clogging up my arteries at 3 am, I can always count on seeing her there."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Denny's we've experienced, and we have been to close to one hundred different Denny's. The decor, while diner-style and well done, it was dirty and neglected. Blinds had months of dust and dirt. Ceiling tiles showed water damage sagging. Even though only 6 patrons were present, it took over 20 minutes to get our order, and mine was not as requested. The waitress was more interested in chatting with her friends behind the counter than ensuring our drinks were refilled. I had to get silverware and place mat from another table. She met minimum standards of professionalism and friendliness. Won't return."}
{"text":"I come here multiple times a month and always sit in Lisa's section. She is the best. Such a sweetheart. The food is always good!   I usually order breakfast food no matter what time of day, so as for the other meals, I can't really say too much. But the French toast Slam is typically my go-to...with a side of hash browns. My boyfriend thinks it's weird because I like to mix my hash browns and eggs together, \"fight me,\" I tell him. Haha just kidding.   But if anything isn't made just the way you like it, they're always willing to fix it at this location. The staff is friendly and usually talkative no matter what time of day...or night... or dawn... you come in.  But honestly, Lisa is or favorite. We ask for her every time."}
{"text":"I do like the food, but expect slow service due to understaffing - this seems to be a problem everywhere. There are often empty tables with a line waiting at the door. Don't bother with the Diner Perks. I was refused my free Grand Slam for joining because my acct didn't show the freeby even tough she said that this happens often. It's a perks program that makes more enemies than friends. Instead go with the AARP 15% discount on everything every day."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Denny's I've ever been to. The girl who sat us didn't ever greet us. I was talking g ro her and I couldn't ever hear her. Out waiter was so slow like a molasses. We had to ask a different waitress for a orange juice and extra cream. I never got offered a fill on my coffee. All the other waiters and waitress around us were on top with there customers and it's like we got the short end of the stick. It's not like they were busy. To top it off the cashier we paid with was so rude. Definitely not returning here again worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Here was our trip broken down of pros and cons.  Pros: Coffee was great. When the food was hot it was good. The manager was very willing to listen to our complaints and try and fix everything. Fun looking place. Cheap and right on the strip.  Cons: Service minus the manager was horrible. Waited about ten minutes after being seated to even be talked to.  Drinks took another 20 minutes to get to us after we ordered them. My girlfriend's silverware had food wrapped in the napkin not once but twice!  Food was cold when we got it.  Probably had the worst table in the place with waitresses and bus boys kept almost hitting our table!  Overall if you don't care about quality of food or service this a great cheap option."}
{"text":"Nothing like good old fashioned American cuisine, So great tasting to my taste buds and a very friendly social environment. Open all hours the the week."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times without issues but today I can say I'll never return. First of all, the staff is extremely unhygienic looking and also very unprofessional. We got our table and it was under the air conditioning. We froze the entire time! It was only about 60 degrees outside!! And to make this experience even more magical, we all got our food at separate times, by the time the last entree came we wanted to go boxes and to get out of there. We sat for another 15 minutes waiting for our bill. Not to mention the fact that our server never asked anyone if they needed drink refills, just nothing. It wasn't insanely busy, there were other staff members walking around. Would never recommend to go here."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was worth it, I would highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried it i love the remodeling they did"}
{"text":"I don't know how you can mess up breakfast but y'all did a Great Job!!! Also how is it that y'all can't get food out at the same time???? That's what I get for coming to Denny's !!! The only positive was the waitress"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and last time I waited almost 30 minutes for the wrong order and didn't get my drink right and try to rip I would not recommend coming here"}
{"text":"The server was okay, her name is Martina she immediate gave us our receipt bill as soon as she serve the food which I personally thought that was rude. Another thing that it bad is keep asking for the full order, if the order is not complete I don't think you should serve it to the table until you have all the food ready, it just bad to keep asking \"oh, we're still missing this and etc.\""}
{"text":"Terrible!  Waited 20 minutes for service. Food was sub-par and cold.  Staff members were very unprofessional, from  the manager to our waitress.  This may be the reason I never visit any Denny's ever again."}
{"text":"The staff seemed really stressed out and not partcilarly warm. We had a 8 person group. However, it took a little while to order. When I asked for rye bread with my burger, I was informed that the options were buns. Then that they did not have rye bread, so I asked for wheat instead. Two of us ordered burgers and weren't asked how we like it. The order took forever and drinks were slowly refilled. Once the orders came we learned that one person couldn't get their full order because they were out of the pancake bites, one person didn't get their seasoned fries (only regular), one person didn't get their pancales for another half hour and it came with no butter. Water wasn't refilled. It was just a mess all around."}
{"text":"Disgusting! First we are brought our fruit cups with no silverware. We asked for some to be brought to the table. The server never brought them so we used our fingers. When our food came one of the dishes did not come out with the rest. When it came the server tried to argue that the eggs weren't cooked right. And that she tried to tell the cook that. The eggs were cooked perfectly, so not sure what that was all about. My friends avocado Caesar salad had very little avocado on it. And when she asked for more she was told no. Then a fly lands on my other friends pancakes and gets stuck. So we call a server over and they take it away. But now we have all lost our appetites. Our server comes over to ask what happened and we tell her and she claims there was no fly. The manager comes and we tell him what happened and he says he will take the pancakes and the salad that was not like the description off. We wait for our new bill but no one comes. So we go to the front and tell them we were waiting for our bill but none of them know where it is. Then the manager hands the bill to the cashier but he took the wrong items off. Another steps in a comps our whole bill. Of the five people we dealt with only one knew what Customer Service is. We will not be back. Horrible service, disgusting food, and flies....eeeeeeewwwwwww."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge 365 #143/365 (Las Vegas Adventures: First stop, Denny's)  Denny's is the mainland Zippy's. It's pretty much a go-to if you are traveling especially since you'll see the signs \"Denny's, next three miles\"  However, we didn't have to hunt around for it, thanks to Yelp and Google Maps!   The Highlights of our Denny's Experience  - Located in the Tahiti Village and they have free valet (if you're too lazy to park your own car)  - We were quickly seated   - Service was quick and friendly since there was more than one waiter/waitress to our table  - Coffee and beverages were always refilled  - Even though the restaurant quickly filled up, the staff including the morning manager made their rounds to everyone to make sure everyone was all right  -Food was hot and fresh  Overall, it was the team effort of the staff that made this experience enjoyable and relaxing especially since we just arrived in Las Vegas that morning.  A big shout out to Ms. Karen Krym, the morning manager for Denny's on that Thursday morning! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Asked steak well showed the manager she was a little nice nasty about the situation when we asked for a desert, but she did offer to take six bucks off."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this place, as I eat at 11:50 pm. Honestly, we came to Denny's because we wanted cheap, good food. It's Denny's, not a 5-star restaurant. Victor, who was serving us was the ONLY server for 8 tables. The only one. The entire night. He managed take outs, all the orders, and got everything out pretty orderly with Rudy, the cook at the helm.   The facility was mostly clean ( Is Victor the buss boy, too? He sure was...) and the food was good. I just wish Victor had a better manager"}
{"text":"My friends and I couldn't find a place to eat at for dinner, so we decided to eat at Denny's.   The Philly Cheesesteak Omelette was exquisite. The saute onions and bell peppers made the meal fresh and not sickening. The fries were amazing and tasted like no other. They super crispy and had the perfect texture to it.   My meal came with toast on the side, however, I waited patiently for 20 minutes and my toast still did not come. I told the waitress and when she finally gave me my toast, it was completely burnt! I basically waited 20 minutes to receive charcoal bread. The service here is definitely not the best and I personally would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night January 6th. We were a party of four. And I can't tell you how the food was because we never received it. It was not crowded service was terrible. Waited 30 minutes to get a cup of coffee we waited over 45 minutes for our food but it never showed up. decided to get out of there. There is no reason for the food to take that long if you're hungry don't go there"}
{"text":"This Denny's was clean and had a friendly staff. We had no problem ordering or receiving our food. Food quality was about the same as any other Denny's. No problems."}
{"text":"My server Jill was incredible and made my day. My food came hot off the grill in 4 minutes and was very tasty. Jill never let my coffee cup run empty. And checked with me three times during my meal to see if I needed anything. Great job Jill and Denny's on Shea."}
{"text":"It's a Saturday night around 9:30 pm and I'm at Denny's. By myself. Yep.   I'm actually happy as a clam right now because it's quiet here and I needed a quiet place to study.   Back in my apartment I was getting the stare down and whine from my dog because it's that time of the night for treats. My dog has an upset tummy right now and I can't give him treats, so I left him, because I can. He'll never remember when I return, he'll just be happy to see me.    Each and every employee here has been awesome to me tonight (they smile) and with the kind of day that I had, I'm really appreciating this exceptional customer service right now. They allowed me to order off the menu and they all help each other out, there's a really nice flow here and I'm thinking the 50s music piping through the system adds to the smooth flow. It's just a perfect moment. My cheese sandwich, cup of chicken noodle soup and one scoop hot fudge ice cream sundae hit the spot. And she just brought me another cup of hot tea...awesome!  I'll definitely keep coming back even when my dog is feeling well."}
{"text":"Took Dad there for breakfast. Our server was very good. However there was a bus girl who spent the entire visit speaking Spanish to her boyfriend in the booth next to us. It was very disruptive. She had to speak louder while she was spot cleaning tables across the room.  Very unprofessional, even for a Denny's."}
{"text":"Husband and I woke up too late to catch any breakfast buffets so we ended up coming to this Denny's. We were not expecting a 5 star meal, yet we did expect at the very least a decent breakfast meal. Unfortunately, we got quite possibly the worst breakfast we've ever had. Our toast was burnt, and not just a little bit on the crust, but charcoal-burnt throughout to the point where we wouldn't quite tell what bread was white and which one was wheat. Our hashbrowns were also done horrible; the exterior was burnt, yet the middle portions were cold. My husband's scrambled eggs were decent, but my over-easy eggs has weird spots in them that made me pass on eating them in fear of becoming ill. The two stars are for the waitress that was very welcoming and for the strawberry-banana milkshake she made me that was delicious. This is a place my husband and I will avoid from now on for food and possibly only seek for milkshakes."}
{"text":"This is what happened from the moment we sat down:  1) Arrival: They sat us and gave us no menus. 2) 5 Minutes (after arrival): A waiter comes up and asked us what we wanted, we asked for menus. 3) 10 Minutes: Another waitress asks us what we wanted, and we order. 4) 15 Minutes: Original waiter returns, ask us what we want. We tell him we've already ordered. 5) 16 Minutes: Waiter and Waitress get into yelling match over whose table it is. 6) 30 Minutes: Drinks arrive. 7) 35 Minutes: Food arrives, we ask for refills on drinks. 8) 55 Minutes: Waitress returns, asks if we want refills. We tell her we do, just as we requested 20 minutes prior. 9) 65 Minutes: Waitress gets drinks, hands us check. 10) 75 Minutes: I give waitress credit card to pay. she says I have to write the amount of the tip on the receipt BEFORE she rings it. 11) 76 Minutes: I write $1 as tip. Hand her it with my credit card. 12) 80 Minutes: Waitress returns with receipt, with $1 tip included for me to sign. 13) 81 Minutes: Leave Denny's 14) 85 Minutes: Check credit card statement in hotel room. No suspicious activity."}
{"text":"I was skeptical because of all the bad reviews but no, this place was amazing. The food was right and the customer service was really amazing. I didn't get the guy who looked like the manager name, but Shane is a true star! Appreciate everything they do for us."}
{"text":"Horrible as usual. Most food comes fast and cold which is pretty weird. It's like Mc Donalds in the 90's, who knows how many hours ago it was made? Don't order the bacon. It seems like it is the pre-cooked paper thin kind where you can taste the preservitives. This location the staff is relatively un-attentive. They hardly stay at your table to take your order correctly and are annoyed when you bring up what they got wrong. I have been here many times and I have never had a meal that was served as I ordered it, tasted fresh/not saturated in old cooking oil and didn't have to send at least 2 items back.  Staff is annoyed when having to seat people and party's are often seated by who complains the most about the wait, not the order people come in. The manager seems to be the only one allowed to cash people out... if he is not already up front... enjoy the wait while another annoyed staff member sluggishly goes to find him complaining to team members along the way. (Old lady with white/grey hair and black glasses... yeah I saw that.) The place is an eye sore as well. It is decorated like a 5 year old robbed the party store down at Charleston and nellis. At any given time they have 4-5 party store themes vomited across the dining room. This time it was spring at the register, valentine's day along the side by the kitchen. Someone's Fiesta on the parallel wall and still fall by the door. God knows what was behind me? I couldn't tell due to the hospital lighting. Dennys locations all over have been putting flowers on their tables for some time but many are neglected and have plant mold that smells awful."}
{"text":"It was as good as a Denny's can get, esp. at 3 in the morning. While they were busy cleaning the store most of the time, I was not always able to get my server but there was someone always checking on me. I only got a cup of hot cocoa and some pancakes but they were good."}
{"text":"Well, it is Denny's. I mean ... it is fucking Denny's. (Say bye-bye to my goddamn security clearance; I am reviewing a Denny's; and, with my real name to boot!)  I saw a young lady crying at the table across from me the first time I dined here. I felt the urge to assure her that is was not that bad, but I had not received my order yet (after having placed it like twenty minutes prior), so I did not want to speak prematurely.   I was embarrassed that I could not manage to find somewhere better to eat after nearly everything else closed at 2 A.M. (including my beloved Pop-Up Pizza).   But at least I was not crying.  I mean, you have the choice of possibly shitty hot dogs on Fremont East surrounded by yuppies, or shitty previously frozen, nuked breakfasts at Neonpolis surrounded by drunken buffoons.   I went with the French Toast Slam¬Æ because I had not eaten at Denny's in many years. With the immense amount of calories I would ingesting in one sitting, I would not have to eat anywhere else for about twelve hours succeeding my visit.  And they have alcohol here. Might be one of only a few locations in the nation (are there that many Dennys outside of the U.S.?); but who cares -- there is alcohol all up and down fucking Fremont. Give me a break.   Get innovative: offer cannabis like in Amsterdam!  - E  Postscript. Their eggs are cage-free apparently. Have to give the evil corporation review-props for that."}
{"text":"This Denny's isn't any different from any other so you know what to expect when you come.  This location is always busy on the weekends so expect a 10 minute wait at least.  The good thing though is they seem to pump people through fairly fast so you shouldn't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"What's there to say? Your typical Denny's! Staff was friendly, food took kind of on the longish side to come, but overall, definitely a good experience! Ordered off the 2 4 6 8 menu, and definitely feel like I got my money's worth!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened here. But last night we had a trainee server who was sweet, and then we got switched to a different server who was very rude by the name, Charm (the irony). She was on and off nice, but it got worse as the night progressed. She kept making us uncomfortable as we were dining in, making very rude sarcastic comments. However, the food was good. Overall, one of the worst dining in experiences. Go to the one on Dixie, better service & food there."}
{"text":"This location has really changed. Poor service and food. Ordered one of the skillets, it came cold and was missing ingredients. On top of that the eggs were runny and raw  - Homegirl ain't trying to get salmonella food poisoning.  We sat near the kitchen, so we heard coworkers yelling to one another across the floor. They seemed disorganized and lost."}
{"text":"Our usual breakfast spot. Friendly staff and a pretty decent egg whites and grits...cant easily find those"}
{"text":"Our waitress was really great. She anticipated our refills before we had to ask and it was super busy in the restaurant. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Service was great, and always an interesting time on a late Saturday night."}
{"text":"Last time I went to this location the restaurant was under renovations and it looked like complete shit. Also they don't know how to make fucking pancakes."}
{"text":"4.5 stars? Are you out of your minds?! I went there last night out of pure desperation as it was so late. The only healthy thing on the menu was a tilapia dish which they wouldn't let me order cos I'm not a 'senior.' Am I not a paying customer? Who cares how old I am?! So anyway, I ordered a veggie burger with fries and rushed back to my hotel. Why? Cos I just couldn't sit there any longer! As I waited for my food, I noticed a humungous hair ball on the floor which kept blowing in towards me in the wind each time the door opened. And worse still - no one came to clean it up until after 20 mins! Ugh!! I can't tell you how many times I checked the inside of my burger! Never again!! No more slumming it in Vegas. It's just not worth it!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, terrible food! Don't come here. Not 1 star but 0. We only came here because my bf was craving French toast and eggs somewhere nearby.  We waited 15 min to be seated (didn't mind because it was busy) but after we got seated and looked at the menus we waited another 15 min for someone to take our order. After that we waited 40 min just for some eggs and toast!! When everything did come out, it wasn't even hot. It was cold and tasted so dry.   It would have been better to make a stop at McDonald's instead because at least they would taste better and be hot.   I don't even know why there's tons of people coming here. Maybe they don't mind their bad service and food? Lol."}
{"text":"Worst possible Denny's. We have came to this location many times and have been very happy. Today that's not the case. The hostess was very rude  when we asked to sit somewhere away from people as we had 3 young kids and didn't want to disturb the other patrons. Once we sat down and ordered our drinks it took 10+ minutes to get them. We watched as the waitress walked around for 5 minutes before ever putting our order in the system.  Our food came out missing items, wrong items and partially cooked food. The cooks decided to only cook one side of the turkey bacon, it was ice cold on the other. The waitress came by and did the customary \"how is everything\" and my fianc√© said \"not okay\", she just walked away. Avoid at all costs. And the Manager? He just walked around not checking how the guests were."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve meal with my oldest daughter. Got T-bone steak and eggs with red potatos.  Cooked perfectly and well seasoned. And they know how to cook a good over easy egg without wrecking it. Latisha was my server. She was decent. I was happy to find a place open during these hours."}
{"text":"If i could give this establishment zero stars i still think it would be too much. I went to this location late night after a club with a group of friends who were all visiting from New york. upon entering we were greeted by a sleepy hostess with only awake enough to give attitude. once we were seated we waited for almost 10 minutes before this tall slim waiter wearing glasses (i forget his name)  came over his attitude was even worse it was already a shock to have waited so long for service seeing that there were only like 5 other ppl in the diner at this time. we proceeded to order drinks and the waiter seemed quite annoyed with us very quickly and to be honest i think the reason was our race. There were other patrons there that were Caucasian and he was very polite to them. the waiter brought over our drinks and every single one of them including the carbonated drinks was lukewarm and watered down we all stated that our drinks were less than par he walked over to the sleepy hostess and they both returned and he proudly informed us ill no longer be serving your party smirked and walked off. at this point i told the waitress/hostess no need to replace my drink because no way i will spend a dime in an establishment that treats me like yesterdays garbage."}
{"text":"Dennys has gone to shit, I have been to 3 different ones just to see if the service was better. 43rd and Peoria, 35th and bethany, and today I17 and Dunlap. They took us to a table that was dirty then they clean the top and everything goes to seats I ask her to clean the seats she rolls her eyes and goes to get a napkin... comes back and hands me the napkins hahahahah. I took it, maybe ahes having a bad day.... no no, she takes our order and has the biggest attitude. She has a dry not welcoming voice as us being here bothers her... the food was horrible we left after we got it. Didn't even eat."}
{"text":"Came here after a 5k run downtown.  Me, my wife and 8 year old daughter were looking for some breakfast after an early morning.  This place looked good and we knew what to expect.    We were soaking wet after the run since it was the \"Sprinkler Sprint\" and they spray you with water cannons, super soakers, etc as a gimmick.  Not dripping, but enough for my daughter to be very cold when not in the sun.  We told the host that we were going to leave since she was so cold, but asked if they had any seats outside available.  He said that the patio seating was the part of the bar and my daughter couldn't sit there.  Then he told us to hold on a minute and went to ask his manager something. The host came back and told us that they had another patio area that wasn't open right now but they could get us a table, even better it was in the sun.  Not normally where's you'd want to sit during August in Las Vegas, but in our situation it was perfect.  They cleaned the table and set it especially for us.  The entire restaurant was spotless as well.    The rest of the meal was as you would expect from Dennys.  The waitress was pleasant and timely but nothing extraordinary.  The food came in a reasonable amount of time and was quite tasty.  The bill was reasonable.    I wouldn't normally think of Dennys when asked about great customer service, but this place does it right!  They went out of our way to help us when they could have just as easily told us they can't help.  I made sure to tell the manager, who was helping the cashier to ring up the long line of customers, what a great job the host did, as well as leaving an above average tip for above average service."}
{"text":"Initial impression was awful. As we parked we saw the manager or host (guy in a red shirt)outside talking to what appeared to be a friend of his. Went inside and were  not greeted until about fifteen minutes later when the waitress greeted and sat us. From there it was great. Service was fast and extremely friendly, and food was great."}
{"text":"I only hit this place for a very early breakfast. The service is always good. The food is comfort style: too much cheese, salt, and grease. It's fine every now and then but not a regular place for me to hit.   Dining room is clean and somewhat modern."}
{"text":"Denny's has really upped their brunch game in recent years! Ended up here on Sunday because Cora's was packed, and we were pleasantly surprised. I built my own breakfast and got buttermilk pancakes (highly recommend), 2 sausage links, hash browns, and scrambled egg whites (also highly recommend). Despite it being a busy Sunday morning we were seated within 5 minutes and service was standard.   I took away 2 stars because their coffee mugs look like they hadn't been washed in years! There were coffee drip stains all over it. We ended up getting our coffee in to-go cups and the rest of the dishes looked clean. Just something to look out for if you ever go."}
{"text":"I will keep it short and simple. Came in this past Sunday evening,  and as soon as I walked in the restaurant smelled like urine. Lost my appetite so I left."}
{"text":"always come here late at night to do homework and everyone is so nice! service is always fast and friendly. beats starbucks wifi!"}
{"text":"It was 10:00 PM on a week night and not much is open around Central Phoenix aside from fast food, so went with the old reliable Denny's at 7th Street & Camelback, aka \"the gay Denny's\" or \"Jenny's\", due to its renown as a repository for the after-closing-time crowd - that didn't go home with somebody.  My barbeque cheddar & avocado burger was absolutely massive, came with a modest quantity of largish (hand-cut?) fries, and was really quite tasty, even apart from my ravenous hunger of the moment.   The food was solid, the value good, the service prompt and courteous.  The dining area was clean, the men's room sanitary and fully stocked, and nobody left hungry.  That works."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick cup of coffee. It was busy as usual and the store was very clean and the staff was very prim and proper. Rachael Duncan was very cordial and pleasant and Amanda Carter was too. They make you want to return. Consequently I do. The cooks make excellant skillets which I love. Other restaurants should come here to learn from Jan, the GM, and JR and Christina and Amanda, the rest of the managment team."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times always a posture experience. Side note I order Togo today and while I'm waiting for my food there is a family of 6 cashing out. I over here the host telling the family they can't use two coupons at once because they donated to hungry kids and got 5.00$ off but they also had a 15% coupon witch the 15% coupon winded up amounting to 2.75 off there bill. Then one of them said but we paid 2 dollars donation for the 5 dollars off. So reverse it because she didn't let us know that. I was so furious by the stupidity of this family. You don't donate money just to benefit yourself. Clearly you do it help starving children. So right in front of them rather then being a jack ass and opening my mouth. I donated 10.00$ and refused the coupon. To show them it's not that hard to be kind. What is wrong with the world today. Wake up people."}
{"text":"Went to this location on Easter Sunday  with my boyfriend. The food was burnt and cold. Asked to talk with manager, a man come over with no name tag.  He stated what is the problem dis not give name. I explained the unacceptable problem with food burnt he crushed French fries in hand and said what do you want me to do. Never apologized or tried to make issue better. Do not go to this Denny manager made issue worse"}
{"text":"Great spot to fuel up on quick, delicious, bad-for-you food right before (or after) you become intoxicated and party all night.  No joke on the speed of service, our waitress was kind and quick. I swear it must have been less than five minutes to receive our food, and less than a minute for our drinks.   It's also huge and thus can accommodate big parties easily.  Plus, its location is really convenient for anyone on the South end of the strip.   Overall, a great Denny's."}
{"text":"Good honest food, great place with great service from David - what more do you want? Made a couple of Brits feel really welcome"}
{"text":"Strictly so-so.  We were sat quickly, but it seems we may have been at a table between two waitresses, and nobody was sure who should come to our table.      The young lady was nice, she took our order.      The iced tea was on the low end of OK--very strong, seemed like it may have been old.  The hot tea came in two parts, which was weird; first a cup of hot water with a tea bag, followed 4 minutes later by a little tea pot with more hot water, and another tea bag.      Upon taking my order, she asked if I wanted gravy on my mashed potatoes--to which I said yes.  When my dinner was delivered, no gravy.  Another in my party ordered Belgian Waffles with scrambled eggs and bacon.  The eggs & bacon came, but no Belgian Waffle.  \"Oh,\" said she, and went back to get the waffle.  After a minute or two we had to catch her eye again, and say \"may we have some syrup?\"      My salad was a bowl of croutons with a couple pieces of lettuce, and two cucumber slices that had been previously frozen.  The dressing looked like a bowl of mayonnaise which had been put in the bowl, then refrigerated for a day or two.  Maybe they \"pre-pour\" portions of dressing, but it makes it look icky, with a skin on the top like old fashioned pudding.  The food was adequate (hence 2 stars), but the wait staff was strictly rookie.  Lastly, the bathroom was FILTHY FILTHY FILTHY.  We decided we'd stop at a gas station on the way home for a cleaner rest room."}
{"text":"Terrible Denny's. only one waitress running around taking orders. After placing our order, food took about 45 mins. 2/4 orders came out Wrong.   One order was lumberjack slam breakfast, with all bacon. Plate came with 3 pieces of bacon and a piece of ham. After asking the waitress to correct the order, we hear the waitress arguing with the kitchen. The cooks shouting they swear they put 8 pieces of bacon on the plate, that we are lying. And if we want the addition bacon, to take the piece of ham and throw it out....ok..  Second order of cali club never arrived at the table, instead an apology that they are out of avocado, and are unable to complete her order. Instead a regular club sandwich was served 20 mins after the rest of the table, 10 mins later a side plate of literally 8 fries.   Third order was the pot roast sandwich... I really wish I took a picture of this monstrosity of a plate because it looked almost as bad as it tasted. It was not a sandwich, mind you. Was mashed potatoes I think, with roast beef in the middle and two slices of bread on the side."}
{"text":"Terrible costumer service. Our server was on the phone with someone on her cell phone in the middle of the restaurant having a full blown conversation, and then finally came to take our order(still on the phone ppl!!) And then came over a few mins later and said \"sorry guys my manager calls at the worst times I swear\" ugh ok then either finish the conversation first or tell ur so called manager you have tables  2 stars BC the food was decent"}
{"text":"HOrrible experience and got sick afterwards... dirty forks, dirty cups and plates.. yuk.. ! will never return again - Health dept. should shut down this place."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast on the weekend with a friend of mine. We choose Denny's because it's in our hood...literally haha.  Denny's is...Denny's...not much needs to be said about the food but what I did want to comment on was one of the servers. He wasn't ours but he was close enough that we got to see him helping the other tables. He reminded me of the guy server from Office Space with the cheery attitude and all the flair. Except instead of flair, he had a massive pen with a holster. It was awesome and he was very helpful - recommending food for his customers, smiling and joking around. He really made our breakfast unique for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to this Denny\"s  for an early dinner. Got in around 4 ordered slow cooked pot roast red mashed potatoes and broccoli...husband ordered cheeseburger and fries food came out everything was room temperature pot roast was watery broccoli cold n hard mashed potatoes warm husband cheeseburger was running with grease bread was over toasted so cracked upon biting into..sad thing about all this was that they were not busy I can expect this service on a weekend but for being Tuesday and around 4 it was some bad service no use in complaing does not do any good....we walk in to restaurants with giving a 20% tip and you work your way up or down and this was by far thumbs down."}
{"text":"This is the worst Denny's ever , I mean nobody expects much from Denny's let's be honest , so I call to order no answer 20 rings , call back get put on hold then I say I'll start driving there to pick up the salmon , ok nobody comes back on phone , I walk in no line , nothing awful !!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite locations!! Always good fast and friendly. Go at off times to avoid Mama June and Honey Boo Boo. I always try to sit either near or at the counter to avoid it."}
{"text":"This place is deserving of five stars for one reason. Our server was a guy named Brady. We would normally not eat at Denny's but when the nephews are in town we have to feed them where high quantities of food are available without breaking the bank. If you're  ever in the area the unlimited pancakes go a long way to feed hungry teenagers. At any rate, Brady was extremely genuine and made our entire experience. He went as far as telling us that 2 eggs would be an additional $4.00 and to be advised if we were going to order from the $4.00 menu (which would have become an $8.00 menu). The money was not really he issue as a much as the consideration on Brady's part. I'm not sure if it's company policy or if he just took it upon himself but that was the feel of our entire experience. Thanks again Brady!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at a Dennys. The service was bad they messed up parts of my order brought us wrong food. I asked for a coke after I finished my first drink and I never got it. On top of all that when we got our food the hash Browns were burned the sausages and bacon that came with my order were cold, and the scrambled eggs did not look or taste like scrambled eggs. It was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant and it is the first time I have not left a tip. I can not recommend this restaurant to anyone so if you are looking for a place to eat go somewhere else, or if you are staying at the La Quinta in just have there complimentary breakfast it's more worth it."}
{"text":"Our service last night was terrible. It wasn't the fault of our waitress (she was trying! Thank you) but it was because of whatever was happening in the kitchen. Heard the male server yelling at the cooks. Watched customers get up and leave. Tables were left dirty... Where was the team work? Why couldn't the hostess, manager, or anyone else try to help bring out orders, clean tables or let customers know there would be a wait? You all seriously need a team meeting and figure out what the problem is. I have never experienced that while out to eat and even for a Denny's? C'mon. The severs base most of their income on tips and to leave them stranded isn't fair. Our poor waitress was left to do everything in her section. Not okay.   To the male server last night - copping attitude at an 80 year old couple over a sundae is the last thing you should do if you want that $3 tip you think you deserve. There are people who WANT to work, so chill out with how you treat the people who pay you and help you.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"The service was not good and my food was luke warn and couldn't even eat my eggs and hash browns."}
{"text":"Took my nephew, niece-in-law and mom here for breakfast last week and enjoyed the food and service so much, took my mom here again today for lunch.  What can you say or rave about Denny's? It's Denny's. It's a chain. You're not expecting to be wowed or have a unique experience. But the food is definitely good. First trip here I had the veggie omelette. This is what I typically get when eating here in Mobile, Alabama when visiting my family. It was just as good here as it was there, so with a chain, at least you get consistency.  Today mom and I tried the fried cheese melt. This is fried mozzarella cheese sticks and slices of American cheese between toast, a twist on the classic grilled cheese, with fries. It was just as good as the picture depicted. Will be having this again, for certain, especially at the affordable and reasonable $4 price tag. Washed it down with this berry chiller drink I saw on the menu, and mom had the iced coffee. The initial and a refill later, and yes, we were satisfied with the taste. Unlimited refills is a great bonus!  The service is great at this location. Servers are very attentive and great. First visit, the server was awesome and didn't sweat me for mentioning IHOP a lot in front of him! lol! The second trip for lunch, the server must have been new. She constantly asked my mom to repeat herself, and for a 77 year old, she enunciates quite well, and that frustrated me more than it did my mom. And she brought the wrong order to a table in front of us. Outside of that, she was very friendly.  We will be returning here in the future. As a matter of fact, mom asked me to bring her back for Mother's Day!  As for the prices? I love the value menu. Outside of that, I think they are a little overpriced to be Denny's. Certain items on the menu are either the same price or higher than a typical coffee house/diner or Applebee's and the senior menu is scarce."}
{"text":"Everybody loves Denny's diner.  One thing that differentiates them from every other diner in the are (especially Eat N' Park) is that the vanilla shakes come with overflow!"}
{"text":"Standard Denny's fare, in a nicely upgraded interior space. Pro tip: avoid the chairs at all costs! They are painfully uncomfortable, so go ahead and fight your friends for the booth space if you have the chance. The water tasted terrible, so avoid that if you can too. Great people watching spot, and respite from the chaos of Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes for food, with no explanation or apology.  Rather defensive waitress offered us drink refills when one of our party complained.    Will not be stopping here again."}
{"text":"Miss April makes us laugh every time we go! She's super sweet and always kind no matter how late we come! She's definitely a great person and worker and we loved having her serve us! I also love the quality of their food as well as how fast it gets to us!"}
{"text":"Ok...my 5 stars isn't on the food..I mean this is a Denny's..it's hot it's cheap..and they are open ..that being said why the hell would I give this joint a 5 star...  The employees..this has become a stop in our 5 hour drive south to see my dad..we leave late and this is the half way point..so it's convenient..  Melissa is so damn up beat and sweet it's sweeter than the smores hush puppies they sell here. She made sure my drink never was empty and let me try the chocolate sauce with the smores too..  Then there's Kerri...she's great as a server and spunky..hey she all charm...and in my second stop here  was my server over just talking my cash..which was a hoot..making random conversation as she picked on her nephew or cousin or what ever..needless to say..  What this place lacks in food..and atmosphere..it make up with servicers.. Great job!   I'll take my Larry  Bird...I mean super bird and head south..  Oh..wear Long sleeves..this place air is working OT!"}
{"text":"First time going to Denny's. Our server was great, the food was great, the place looked nice. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was bad day for them but only 2 people working all table were dirty so we had to seat on smaller table, glasses had water spot mark on them , worst steak but nice pancake ."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast yesterday.  It's a standard Denny's.  Service was good, my Southwest skillet was good, the coffee was off.  It was strong and bitter.  I like strong but not the bitter.  The location was a Coco's for several years before becoming a Denny's.  Besides being America's diner, I think they are America's senior dining spot.  The music is definitely 60s which I like.  I will be back to Denny's from time to time, but they seem stuck in their rut although they're always trying with new foods and other items.  The place is OK."}
{"text":"We landed in Calgary pretty late, so Denny's has been a real lifesaver for us.  It might be a standardized chain of restaurants, but the quality and the size of the food beats any fast food alternative.  Obviously it might take more time to eat but in about 30 minutes or less we were heading back to the motel pretty satisfied.  The fact that it's 24/7 makes it a perfect stop on the road to Banff too."}
{"text":"Is it me or is Denny's now mostly for gray hairs like me?  The food is aimed at the older market and even the music is appealing to me.    I rate this 2  1/2 stars.    We stopped here for a quick meal after visiting a friend in the hospital and I had to be home, change, and to downtown Las Vegas for a play at the Las Vegas Academy.  Denny's fit the bill.  I had a chicken breast with two sides.  Small meal and it was quite tasty.  The staffing was awful.  One waitress for all the tables.  That's not acceptable and one reason why the star count isn't a full 3."}
{"text":"Took 20 min got there at 6 am we left by 6:20 due to no one even asking us what drinks we wanted just me and 1 other person i cant believe how shitty they are"}
{"text":"I got the tilapia dish, can't remember what it's called exactly. It came with two sides. The tilapia itself was okay, seemed to be cooked fine but the pico and avocado were what made it acceptable. Fries were good too. I got a side of the cheddar whipped potato and they were bad. The cheese tasted so fake. My friend also had lasagna and it looked like it had been frozen for awhile and then heated up for her--which it probably was. The quality of anything that had cheese on it was not good. My other friend had a side of sweet corn. Also seemed frozen and heated. I guess we should expect this kind of quality for Denny's, but I can't rate it well if I didn't enjoy it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! If I could give 0 stars, I would. The waitress (don't remember her name) was rude and very inattentive. Don't go here"}
{"text":"Its hard to say what was worse, the food or the service. When our food arrived at the table, the waitress tossed the plates in front of us, and walked away without saying a word. We didnt hear from her again, until she tossed the bill on the table. My hamburger looked and tasted like it was microwaved. It had a rubbery skin on it, and it was raw and greasy inside. YUCK!"}
{"text":"This was the Tuesday my wife's cleaning lady comes.  Every two weeks, I come back from the gym, shower quickly, and then make a quick escape from the two so I don't have to hear their silly chatter.  More important, they want me the hell out of the way!  I needed to make a stop downtown anyway so I quickly decided to head for this Denny's.  I've driven by after a show several times and I wanted to try it. I parked in the city owned garage below Neonopolis and it's a short walk one flight up to get to the store areas and the Denny's.  The entrance is on the side.  I ordered a Start Up omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with a choice of cheese and comes with toast and hash browns or grits.  I got tomato slices instead of the toast and grits.  I had already been brought fresh coffee.  The omelette was a standard one with a fair amount of cheese inside.  The tomato slices were a nice change from the carbs of the breakfast sides.  The plate was one of the hottest plates I've touched in quite awhile and it kept the breakfast warm while I ate.  My server was a young woman who was very pleasant.  She brought me some Cholula as requested.  That's always a bonus.  One criticism--the small booths are really small!!  It would be hard to fit two standard sized adults in the space.  I pushed the table almost to the far side of the booth.  Sit at the counter or outside.  A couple of things.  They advertise that this is the only Denny's in the world with a wedding chapel.  Well, not really.  There's an area with some wedding photos on the wall and if you want to get married at Denny's in downtown Las Vegas, that's where it will be.  They move the tables aside and you exchange your vows there.  I am aware from the news that there has been a wedding here.  Well, the licenses are sold only a few blocks away.  Second thing, the parking in the garage below Neonopolis is so convenient.  Denny's does not validate for this city owned garage but I had no payment due when I left.  perhaps it was the time of day, the day of the week, or merely the fact that I was here for less than an hour.  I'll be back.  This is a really nice Denny's."}
{"text":"I am rating this based off other Denny's I have been to in my lifetime :).  First of all it's a Denny's, perfect for late night breakfast cravings, random fried food and in our case a late night brownie a la mode.   I always am so surprised at how cheap Denny's is. The service was good but it was a Tuesday night at 2am with only 2 other booths filled. The waitress even let us substitute our hot fudge for caramel at no extra cost.   Don't expect to be blown away by the food, but expect to meet your inner fat kid's craving."}
{"text":"The food was bad. I ordered a choco shake for the hubby and I, which supposedly comes with the extra in the mixing tin. I only got a glass. When I asked the waitress, she said you get it only if there's leftovers. Hmm, I don't think she gets the idea.  My hubby's food was not as described - the spicy cowboy chopped steak, which should've been called hamburger steak. My pulled BBQ chicken sand was not even saucy. It was awful food and service. The only reason why we ate it was because we didn't have to \"pay\" for it. It was mostly covered with a comp. :P never again."}
{"text":"We stopped here for an early dinner last night after an appointment.  It's a typical Denny's that caters to people of my age--gray hairs.    I had the Super Bird, a turkey sandwich with cheese and bacon.  It's been a long time since I had one and it tasted very good.  My wife had an omelet and she was quite pleased with it.  For dessert I splurged and got their new Red Velvet Pancake Puppies Sundae.  Red Velvet dougnut holes with cream cheese frosting and vanilla ice cream.  Super!  Probably 1,000 calories in dessert alone.  :-)  Our server, Travis, was excellent.  He was polite and very much on the ball with answering questions, taking the order, and refilling drinks.  I am a fan of this location!"}
{"text":"This place is not managed well. Seldom is there anyone up front to greet you or put your name on the waiting list.  After a 5 min. wait we were seated & ignored it was 23 min. before a waiter came over to take our order & get us drinks. A couple came in after us & was seated in the booth right behind us they placed their order & were leaving by the time we got our food.  They were not that busy & this has happened to us 3x now it shouldn't take 1-1/2 hours to get in/out after a 5 min. wait to be seated. And good look paying your bill sometimes there's someone at the register other times not."}
{"text":"It's by far the worst service EVER! this company needs to fire their management first of all. 2nd, it's Christmas, don't have only 3 servers on the floor. Didn't even get any drinks. Never coming back or recommending this place to ANYONE"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm currently a student and I frequent this restaurant for studying and they are extremely patient, allowing me time to study before ordering. The waiters are great, but my favorite is Max, so ask for him. Thank you staff!"}
{"text":"I agree with Anthony . From the time you walk in the door. Trying to get seated. Cold food.  Took forever.  Couldn't get check.  And had to get up and ask waitress for check.  Guy at cash register didn't want to take our money as he was texting someone.  It was the most exasperating dining out experience I can recall.  I firmly believe they should terminate everyone on the morning shift and start with green horns from the detention center.  The public would be served better.  Also almost broke a leg as the entrance was sheer ice.  I suggest you visit so you will know I'm not exaggerating ."}
{"text":"One of the better Denny's in the area. I've never had really any kind of trouble with this location. Service is usually pretty good and the food not too bad."}
{"text":"Very slow service and some of the food we got was over cooked and some stuff was cold. Watched our waiter walk past our food on the counter a few times before bothering to bring it out (watched him stand around doing nothing between passes). Probably the worst dennys ive been to."}
{"text":"As a breakfast snob I really do not like Denny's.  They don't really do anything especially well.  Also, I've had inconsistent quality of food and helpfulness of staff on different occasions.  I can't slam this place for one unpleasant waitress, but I can for those inconsistencies and that fact that there are just so many other places that do what they do better.  In fact, this place was the very last Denny's I ever ate.  The food took forever, it wasn't well done, came out all screwed up, and the waitress was unpleasant.  After that experience I decided to never set foot in another Denny's."}
{"text":"Denny's always trys to misadvertise for kids eat free nights! Online you will clearly see the advertisement for kids eat free usually for every tuesday night 4-10, however, some locations are weekdays from 4-10.  However when you visit the location there is no signage or advertisment re-confirming the info online.  When staff is asked you will get I dont know let me ask the manager & then you will have re-ask staff just to get an answer!  Then when you do get a yes, because,  you clearly stated it is advertised online & thats the reason why I am here(lets face it the food isnt the greatest!) is when the will tell you yes, but the check wont reflect it!  This is the third time I have visited dennys & had to fight to have them remove my kids meals from the bill!!!  Don't go to dennys the food is bad, they dont honor kids eat free as advertised, & they even attempt to fraudulate the bill!"}
{"text":"Wife and I came in on a busy day. Only waited for about five minutes and than were promptly seated. Server greeted promptly and grabbed our order.   Not much more to explain its a typical experience being in a quick diner with very casual service"}
{"text":"The food was hella greasy, hash browns were overcooked and the wait for me was far too long for the food I received. I stayed in Tahiti Village hoping to get a decent meal after walking the scorched earth from my room.  The manager did give me 20% discount off my meal and I appreciated his integrity and concern however we'll pass on any future visits."}
{"text":"Very clean, polite wait staff, and manager was very nice. One of the cleanest Denny's in the valley and I recommend this location."}
{"text":"Service was great, but the chicken fried steak was swimming in too much bland white gravy. The soup was good though."}
{"text":"Descent Denny's.  Clean, typically good service, big parking lot.  Never have had an issue with my meals or service.    I dine early in the morning after I leave work.  I really like the server Joseph, as he truly understands the service industry.  He adds a nice touch as he definitely goes above and beyond.  Sometimes it's a bit too much and makes me uncomfortable.  Like when he brings me too much stuff I didn't ask for.  I didn't need every dipping sauce in the kitchen, just honey mustard.  Or keep the to-go soda, I have to sleep when I get home.    That being said, If I was still in the service industry I would hire him.  I would just have him tone it back just a bit."}
{"text":"Still pretty solid as far as food goes.  Pretty consistent and descent service.  It seems like there some seriously strange characters that work and eat here nowadays.  Very odd smell inside which tends to be worse at certain times of the day.  You would think as pretentious as NHT thinks they are, there would be a bit higher end food choices.    Oddly enough, the elderly are pretty set in their ways and prefer places like Denny's and Bob Evans.  It works for a simple meal that cheap and quick."}
{"text":"This is impressive. Obviously a busier than normal time. Management handling things with grace, supporting staff as they deal with customers that are being rude and harsh.  I think this team rocks- the food is just Denny's right? But the service is polite and the staff is pulling it all together- together! Our server Lisa was great and manager Tim is an excellent leader. If you are in town and hungry, head here :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The head waitress on shift, training the new hire who served us (tonight), has the worst attitude and sense of customer service. Our food sat at the pass for over 5 minutes & our order had to be sent back 2x. We were told if we wanted to keep the mistaken item we'd be charged.  The dining area is dirty and needs attention.  Management needs to take a serious look at the night staff. Others waited to pay their check for several minutes while the phone rang multiple times. The same waitress was audibly irritated with the incoming call, making comments before picking it up.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"One star because ZERO stars aren't allowed.  It was our first time back after 5 years. My husband wanted to go somewhere else and I insisted I wanted to go to Denny's.  I didn't come back in five years because they argued with me about giving me french fries with the Philly steak sandwich (it comes with fries, waiter said no and refused to get me any fries). We just left because we spent 5 minutes standing waiting for rhe hostess to be seated and N-O-B-O-D-Y acknowledged us. Not even to ask us to give them a minute.  And they're not even that busy.  Well, guess what? This party of 4 is taking their business to another restaurant.   Sayonara, Dennys."}
{"text":"The service was horrible, didn't bring refills at all didn't bring the check at all we had to hunt her down. Felt invisible frankly"}
{"text":"If i could rate this place, i would give it a 10 - for sure!! The worst service i have ever had in 40 years of my life, beyond horrible service, ordered a cup of coffee and English muffins, got the coffee after waiting 20 min and was cold, never saw the server again nor the english muffins!  Just left and would never go to a dennys again!!"}
{"text":"This is just like every Denny's I have stopped at in that the food is the same however the staff makes it or breaks it. I was out of town and the waitress Sarah was helpful and friendly to make it a great experience."}
{"text":"Nothing special. The wait time is ridiculous both when it's packed and when it's empty. The food is definitely not as tasty as it is in the States but that probably has to do with the fact that restaurants in Canada watch caloric intake and grease levels. Feel as if I could make better food at home for free. I had ordered the peanut butter and chocolate chip pancake breakfast. The waitress asked if I wanted sausage, bacon or a mix of both and I chose a mix. What a mix meant to them was one over cooked, shrivelled up piece of bacon and one baby breakfast sausage. The pancakes were overcooked and blackened on the top. Unfortunate, very much a let down."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! Literally the worst Dennys I ever been to. Some of the staff is really rude, the food came out cold, they over-microwaved it after, and there was more than $6.00 of charges on the tab that shouldn't of been there.. I can go on but I'll end it there.... This place is horrible! Save yourself the headache of coming here!"}
{"text":"First time to this location will never come back. Very poor service and quality of food. Very disappointed !"}
{"text":"Went in to have dinner/breakfast with my little family on Feb 16 around 930pm. Let's just say food was great but service lacked. Tremendously. Our server was Jimmy. Nice guy just not a great server. Spent alot of time talking, watching TV, and on his phone. The manager on duty did a better job of taking care of us. Ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and was almost dying of thirst until he brought the check a while later and asked me if I needed another refill. Our check was also incorrect, had to remind them twice to fix it. Needless to say I will probably never be back for night service. Quality service seems to only be offered for breakfast."}
{"text":"Of course I was drunk. Why else would I be at Denny's of all places at 3 am... I remember being pissed about having to wait for a table for 20 minutes.  I also remember ordering a nasty salad, with an even nastier dressing...  There was literally no server to be found for 30 minutes after we finished our meal, so I guesstimated the check and left money on the table...  2 stars for the poor employees that have to deal with customers like me..."}
{"text":"It's Denny's. This has been a longtime location for my family, so I joined my aunts, mom and cousin for breakfast.   The waitress seemed slightly flustered even though we weren't rushing her. Although the food quality was never top-tier, I found it particularly underwhelming. And where the hell did my cheese fries go?? The milkshake was on point as normal, at least.   My cousin noticed a television and chairs set up in the back dining room like a makeshift office. Putting a positive spin on it she stated \"what is that for I wonder? Training?\" It just left me bizarrely nauseated.   The quality time with my fam was nice and I appreciated the waitresses' hustle. But the food and the flustered way she shoved an extra chair out of the way, precariously close to my surgery leg left me ready to roll out."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice but my eggs were undercooked whites runny ordered over easy.. hashbowns and eggs came out warm-cold pancakes good she was nice enough to charge only for pancakes...thank you..im sure they will fix this the next time i come here staff was nice and polite.."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food took a long time from the kitchen. The burger looked like a smashed burnt patty. Not good. The chicken sandwich was good. I like the Dennys chain because of the variety but the food usually takes a significant time to come out."}
{"text":"We almost walked out before we were even seated. There was all ready a group waiting in front of us for who knows how long. A lady was at the register taking a phone order and yelled a the group of 4 or 5 waitresses standing behind the counter to seat us. One finally starts to mozy on over and seats the group in front of us. Then we waited another few minutes until a different waitress came and seated us. Then we ordered an appetizer and watched the cook set it in the window. Then we watched our waitress Marie walk by it a dozen times. We asked a different waitress if she could bring it over for us since Marie never got close enough to our table to flag her down. When they brought us our appetizer it was cold and disgusting. And before I could even force myself to swallow it down they brought or dinner. We sent back the appetizer. The slamwitch that my husband ordered was insanely salty. He couldn't even eat it. Then we told the waitress we were ready to leave and asked us to wait for the manager to take the appetizer off our bill. So we waited... And waited... And waited. Then of course, as soon as we start walking towards the front she comes up to give us the bill. The manager rang us up and didn't even say anything or apologize about the service. She just told us how amazed she was that a kid actually won a toy out of the machine and it was a smurf and it was so cute and do detailed. I looked at husband could tell he was ready to explode. We paid and left no no tip."}
{"text":"So many things went wrong, OMG... Started off with taking forever to get Service.. then don't put ur hand on my shoulder when speaking to me!!.. don't call me *Mija*sweetie* etc!... Then, all the food comes to the table except my mom's pancakes.. waitress says I'm getting them now... Later, my mom asks again... 25 min went by before she got her food and the rest of the table was basically done.. then, no drink refills at all... Waitress sucked so bad and she wasn't new at all.. if they are busy and under staffed they need to put the useless manager and host to work to help out.  Oh and DONT ORDER THE SPICY CHICKEN SKILLET they been advertising!!!!.. it looked NOTHING like the menu!!!!.. it looked like a bunch of slop on a plate with sauce... The manager seen me giving him really dirty looks and he came to the table taking away dirty dishes saying, how's everything?.. well we informed him of everything and he could have cared less... I showed him the picture I took of my food and then his menu and he had the nerve to tell me *corporate sends those menus to us and I don't know why but it's always a larger portion then we use*.. I was like wow!... SMH... So, anyone reading this don't expect ur food to come out looking like the picture...."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast on the strip. I tried the Philly cheese steak omelette, and it was really good!"}
{"text":"Thank you Denny's for the Military Discount! Woo-hoo 10 percent off your order!  Seated promptly on a busy Sunday morning.  Service was friendly.  Coffee and veggie omelet was yummy.  Kids loved the pancakes and kiddie menu.    I'll be back:)"}
{"text":"You can find me here during my late night food craving.  I usually order the Fit Slam and if I want to spoil myself, I'll add on strawberry pancake puppies.    It's usually a one man service crew (minus the cook) when I'm here.  No matter how busy he gets he handles business.  And if there's an obvious abundance of crowd then the server knows he has the need to inform people the truth that there could be a wait.  And people still wait.    Okay food, okay service, nothing great, nothing bad, very reliable especially for the central west side of Vegas."}
{"text":"My tummy was a mess the morning after Vanessa's surprise birthday at the Cosmo so what better way to counter the poison by stuffing yourself with food and forcing it out?  The menu seems to have been completely revamped from the last time I went.  There's a special menu with even number denominators $2, $4, $6 which actually saves you money.  But like the example in my picture, instead of this special menu which would cost me $6 for a French Toast Breakfast I would only get one toast, two eggs, and either bacon or sausage.  Blah, this wouldn't have been enough especially for the awesome drinks Shawn H. made us last night.    So for $2 more i went with the French Toast Slam, I got TWO/DOS slices of french toast, two eggs, two bacon strips AND two sausage links, hollaaaa if you hear me.    The also have an all you can eat pancakes for $4!  Go, do ittttt!  But next time, I need to eat someplace with more fresh air."}
{"text":"When I took a sip of my milkshake I got 2 pieces of hard plastic in my mouth.   Upon notifying our waiter he brought us a new one and said \"I'm sorry here is a new milkshake. The plastic came from the ice cream container.   We'll give you 10% off your milkshake and if you get plastic in this one too it will be free.\"   Are you kidding me? Thank you Dennys for the 39 cents off when you fed me plastic.   But wait... Milkshake #2 had ANOTHER PIECE OF PLASTIC IN IT.   Upon calling the manager they said \"Oh yes our ice cream containers are very flimsy\" and took it off the check.   Thank you for the $3.99 off for feeding me plastic twice.   Managers/corporate,  what are we going to about this?"}
{"text":"I'm very torn on this review. The experience was good enough but the food was just..... ... Denny's (I know, what did I expect).  This is a beautiful Denny's- it's fun, new, almost all booths (something I love!) and is honestly the least sketch-looking one I've ever been to. The service was wonderful! Our server, Heidi, was so kind and attentive, she was the best part of the meal. The cleanliness was ...ok.. could have used a mopping/sweeping but the surfaces looked good.  The one down side was the food. I know, I know, it's Denny's..and I totally get that it's going to be crap food (which, sadly, I'm not opposed to). But this time around the food was decidedly very fake and mass produced. Things were just off and you could just taste all of the preservatives, additives, etc. I had both bacon and a ham and egg sandwich and the pork had a creepy, chemically smell. The toast was covered in creepy slow-melting margarine instead of butter. The eggs seemed fake. It was just sorta depressing. I'm all for greasy diner food but it's gross when it's all fake and full of chemicals. Sad because it's a nice looking place and I know it's just the current state of mass-produced food in this country. Sigh.  Also, I believe that the prices were higher at this one than at older ones in less-desirable neighborhoods."}
{"text":"This Denny's serves alcohol!  Denny's on Fremont is actually located at Neonopolis.  The menu looks the same as the other locations with a few additional items too.  I remembered Denny's as a go to place after a night of drinking.  It was a place you can come to sober up at, eat, and prevent the oncoming hangovers but this is completely different.  But the temptation to continue drinking is now here, it's neither good or bad, just interesting.  One thing I know for sure is that it is a good addition to downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Breakfast of Champions!  OK, more like breakfast of maybe semi-pros.  When was the last time you saw Michael Jordan at a Denny's?  That's right, never.  Although doesn't Shaq or Magic Johnson own a few of them?  Can't remember.  I like this Denny's location much better than the one closest to my home.  This one is bigger and the d√©cor is a bit more inviting.  Service seems quicker & more hospitable.  Plus this Denny's turns over people at an alarming rate, especially on a weekend morning.  Long wait lines disappear pretty quick!  Not that I eat breakfast at Denny's all that often.  And really, Denny's for the most part is synonymous with breakfast.  I look at the lunch & dinner menu and I just shake my head.  Why oh why does it seem like it caters to older (much older) people?  Not saying it's bad, but just seems so old-fashioned!  So, I just stick with the breakfast stuff.    I like cheap, and when I want an OK breakfast for chump change & am sick of $1 breakfast sausage burritos from McDonald's, I end up at Denny's.  Yeah, you go to their regular breakfast menu and some of that stuff costs you a few fingers!  More than $12 for some of their damn omelets!  $10 for a friggin' breakfast sandwich!  Unbelievable!  So I go with the little, all the way in the back of the book, value menu.  Get items priced at $2, $4, $6, and $8!  More my style!  Save the rest of that money for some Lipitor prescription later.  I often opt for the $4 Everyday Value Slam - its got 2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs cooked to order (I go with sunny side up), and either 2 bacon strips or 2 sausage links (I usually ask for 1 bacon strip & 1 sausage link).  All you need for a growing middle-aged man!    But this particular morning I was feeling extra manly and won a gangbusters of cash the night before at the casino...went home with $20 profit WOOT WOOT!  Changed that sucker for all $1's homey!  I felt like ballin' so I went with the BIG bad boy - the $8 Grand Slam Slugger!  2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs cooked to order (over easy this time), 2 bacon strips AND 2 sausage links yo!  With a side of well-done hash browns, baby!  Plus it includes an endless cup of coffee AND a small cup of juice...orange for me, boi!  Breakfast just got BIG PIMPIN'!  Felt like a million bucks eating this thing!  Pancakes were light & fluffy not to mention drenched in butter & warm syrup, dippin' my bacon into the runny egg yolk & ketchup just like I like to do, even the damn coffee was pipin' hot & fresh like Beyonc√©'s backside (yeah I got 99 problems but hash browns ain't one).  Don't forget the Cholula!  But whoa, had to knock it down a star because of the cholesterol overload!  Halfway through I was boggin' down, this Grand Slam Slugger ain't no joke!  Watch out, it'll put you down for the count!  Just too rich!  I felt like I needed some kind of vegetation on my plate to counter all of the oily goodness.  Even a piece of parsley would have been good to gnaw on.  Ended up taking a to-go box with about 1/4 of the Slugger left.  Be forewarned - cold, rubbery pancakes make bad, BAD leftovers.  Great bargain for all the food & drink you get!  The $8 Grand Slam Slugger from Denny's will be my go to breakfast meal from now on, except I'll probably end up sharing it with the wifey.  Yeah, 2 for 1!  Save that money!  For Lipitor & a crossfit membership!  No joke.  #ImfatandIknowitsojustleavemealonebecauseImhungry"}
{"text":"Sitting inside of Dennys right now , watching the waitress go from table to table and never even looking in our direction.  As I try to get her attention she walks away,  I flag down another lady to ask for manager but she says They Don't HAVE One , WHAT ! Absolute LA THE Worst Service Ever . You'd get better service at Arco. Do not come here, unless you like being ignored.  I guess you have to give a star so 1 it is."}
{"text":"Denny's on a Sunday? After church? Egads! I was shocked that we didn't have to wait at all and there were 9 of us in our group! The server was on top of things and we didn't have top wait for anything. It got pretty busy while we were there but there was never a wait at the door. I had a diet-friendly meal and it was very tasty. Somebody had the pumpkin pancakes and loved them. We had babies and adults and everyone was pleased. The bill wasn't a wallet killer either! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is not a great Denny's. We arrived after 1 pm and were told the wait would be about fifteen minutes. We waited for nearly thirty. We had five people in our group and were asked if we wanted to be split up, despite the fact that a group of six and a group of four were seated before us after they had arrived after we did. The food left much to be desired. Things seemed like they came straight out of the freezer and were minimally warmed up. Our waiter was rude and not attentive at all. There were also a ton of flies buzzing around in the restaurant."}
{"text":"It's Denny's!! I haven't stepped into one in many years! I had a great experience at this particular Denny's. Our waiter was polite and friendly. The service was quick from getting a table, ordering, and checking out! Fasssssst! I enjoyed my time here! :D"}
{"text":"It's Denny's. At this one I once found public hair in my fruit salad. Manager at the time offered me more fruit. I declined.   It's gotten better but the servers still look ready to kill everyone. As a former Denny's server I can sympathize."}
{"text":"My family & I walk into Denny's. Leah is the hostess who asks me \"how many?\" I tell her 7 and she puts her face in her hands, says \"great!\" as she lets out the loudest sigh. I apologize. She sits us down and says \"Im not giving you attitude. I was trying to figure out where to seat you, I'm letting you know now that I'm the only one here so you're gonna have to bear with me.\" She tosses the menus on the table and 2 slide off the table. She walks outside and lights up a cigarette. We are watching her smoke right next to the sign that prohibits smoking near a public entrance. After 10 minutes she walks back in and says \"are you ready to order?\" We tell her we are still deciding on our food but we'd like to order our drinks. My daughter asks for a milkshake and she says the machine is down for sterilization. She takes our menus and slams them under the hostess podium. The people standing at the register waiting to pay are staring at this point and are completely baffled. Leah must have been having the worst night ever because she didn't have a shred of professionalism or humanity. I wasn't going to sit there with my family and subject us to her continued rudeness. I approached Leah and told her to cancel our drinks because we were leaving since we were obviously making her night worse. She doesn't even look up at me and merely says \"mmm hmm\" I am confused. Didn't Leah apply for this job? Didn't she read the job description? If not here's a tip for Leah, don't take your anger out on your customers and make them feel like a burden when part of your livelihood relies on their tip."}
{"text":"Horrible service is an understatement! The server was not able to answer any of my questions. We went there for my birthday so I was in a great mood to begin with. The server had to go find out everything I asked him and didn't come back for 20 after each question. Another family was seated after us and got their food and eating and our server hadn't even taken our order. Almost an hour later, he finally took our order. It was so bad that I wanted to leave even though we were there to celebrate my birthday. We called the manager and he was rude and didn't care how we were treated. Whoever owes this location needs to fire all these employees! Anyways, I love Denny's but certainly not going back to this location - EVER!!"}
{"text":"Nope!!!    While vacationing in Las Vegas Nevada we decided to go by this Denny's for a bite to eat. I have one word for this Denny's : NOPE!!!       Horrible service."}
{"text":"This is usually my favorite Dennys. I normally go to the one on Dunlap after the bar for some food but tonight they were out of all the things I wanted. So we came here which this is my favorite Dennys out of all of them. Our server is wasted. She's been drinking way too much to be working. There isn't a manager on duty at this moment or I would be talking to them about this situation."}
{"text":"I was hungry for some eggs and hash browns before grocery shopping so I stopped by Denny's on Bell and 79th Ave.   I was seated by the hostess and told the waitess would be right over. And then I sat, and sat and sat. I looked around and saw no one I could make eye contact with. This is a Wednesday morning at 8 am, a woman by herself for breakfast. I was in that booth for 5 minutes and no one came over so I left. Big mistake,  I'm  a good tipper and an a frequent customer to places I get good service from. Zero stars from me if it was a choice."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Not only was the service terribly slow, but there was a hair in my food. To which, when reported to the manager she told me \"we don't have any blonde employees\" when she herself was blonde along with the woman who delivered our lunch was blonde. The hair was in my sandwich, therefore it could not have been mine. The negative experience combined with the awful attitude of the manager(if she can be even be called that) will have me never going to another Denny's again."}
{"text":"Decent location because the cooper rd location closed. Nice 50's diner decor.....looks recently renovated. Had the cali avocado burger and my wife had the chicken fried steak. Both were good and the service was on point."}

The food was average (c'mon-you know what you are getting at Dennys)."}

{"text":"Denny's is Denny's no matter where you go but sometimes all it takes is exceptional customer service to take what could have been an ordinary experience into an enjoyable one. Our server Calvin was on top of it. He was very tentative, friendly, and professional. Whether you're at a 5 Star restaurant or Denny's, Calvin is the type of server you want. These 5 stars are for Calvin."}
{"text":"The starberry and white chocolate chips where EVERYTHING I loved it the sever was very nice"}
{"text":"1st time in a Denny's restaurant and my first impression is not good. Seasoned fries are good, way better than the regular ones, which taste bland.   It would be nice if the waitress regularly checked the table. The chicken avocado sandwich I ordered was good. No checks for water and coffee refills (oh and the coffee was lukewarm) didn't see the waitress at all after the food was ordered. I would understand if the restaurant was busy, but there was only 2 other groups inside. Not really worth visiting again really. There's definitely better chain restaurants in this category of eateries out there."}
{"text":"Understaffed for a Saturday and In Vegas?  and messed up on all of the orders. Food was cold like if it were on the counter for a long time even the inside of the steak was so cold. So much people waiting and not enough people working. Waitress was nice but overworked with more than 10 tables just by herself. Very bad! Never coming back here"}
{"text":"Deserves 0 stars!!! Went a fewmonths back waited forever just to get our drink order taken. Then waited another 15 just to get a fruit punch and coke. Still hadnt had food order taken. Waiter was friendly but overwhelmed. He was alone waiting on six or more tables. Finally had food order taken, needless to say another century for that to come, gave up on asking for a refill. So tried again tonight ( hubby likes Denny's) didnt disapoint! Srvice still sucks!!! One waiter for eight diffrent parties, useless manager ignored us. Never again!!! The Ihop 5 min away was much better"}

{"text":"Great service, food was fast and great. Eating dairy free due to doctors order and the server was very accommodating and made sure to double check ingredients and check back with me which was nice. He made this a great Dennys visit. Kudos to Patrick on the day shift."}
{"text":"My husband and I are rarely free in the mornings and so when we are we like to go out for breakfast. This was early morning so there was no rush and the place was practically empty. Tell me why we waited over 45 minutes for our food!? My husband clearly saw that it had been sitting under the heater the entire time, what!? Yes it's true. Sure enough when the waiter finally decided to do her job the food was cold! Funny thing is that the couple leaving as we had arrived had been complaining about getting served cold food. The service was just awful at this location."}

{"text":"Worst experience my boyfriend and I have ever had going out to eat. Food was cold and looked and tasted like it was all microwaved. Table and booth was dirty and sticky. If you want a quick but good breakfast definitely go to U.S Egg"}
{"text":"A couple of things you need to know so your experience will be as positive as possible. I've been here many times and you should ask to be sat in Lourdes' section. She always seems to on top of things when it comes to service. Any other waitress is slow and incompetent, period!Also I don't believe all their cooks are experienced at this location, so have no reservation sending something back if not the way you want it. Other then the above, it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"9-16-17 Terrible customer service. Manager is just as rude as the staff. Our waitress completely forgot about us. You can hear the staff using profanity within hearing distance of small children."}
{"text":"Good wait staff. They have a nice white egg om-let. French toast and pancakes tasty.  This place is very close to the University, and within a mile of several hotels."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times and it's the nicest Dennys I've ever been too. The staff is nice as well as the interior and exterior of the building.  It's been empty both times I was there so my food came fast and was awesome. I love how the core menu stays the same and they change the secondary or specials menu around periodically. They also have free wifi so if you can't put your phone down and are for some silly reason still paying for data on an overpriced contract this might help..."}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge us and now she's taken our order and it's been 45 minutes and no food"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Me and Denny's go back a long way.  Decades, in fact.  So this review is totally biased by emotion.  Denny's is my gold standard for all day breakfast.  It never fails in quantity, freshness, perfect easy over eggs, and OMG the pancakes.  And bottomless coffee that actually wakes me up.  And colourful menus.  And low prices.  The dining room has always been clean at all the locations I have ever visited across North American over the years.  Denny's formula, as stated above, is consistent yet the menu has evolved to include healthy options, such as grit and oatmeal.  The dinner menu has a wider offerings as well, though I confess that I also order breakfast when I patronize for dinner.  I don't even know if I can wholeheartedly call it a greasy spoon, cause there are so many items that don't fit that name.  Still, Denny's is the all-day-breakfast love of my life."}
{"text":"What I consider to be a five star diner experience.  Sometimes when walking in an establishment to redeem my free birthday offer I get that look of disdain but here I was greeting with an enthusiastic smile.  Made my day, quick quality service and food cooked to perfection!  Continuously fresh brewed diner coffee filling my cup is a nice change of pace from the pretentious."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big fan of chain like breakfast places like this, but with that being said my experience was better than I expected.  It was a Sunday morning so of course it was packed!   I walked in, put my name on the list, and got seated not five minutes later.  They were very patient with me as I was waiting on someone for at least twenty minutes. The food was decent for the price and the service was as well.  I prefer many other breakfast places but for a quick, decent, well priced breakfast I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"People are being served out of order. Servers are serving there regular customers first. 3 cooks and the boss in the kitchen and they cannot cook  one and a half hours food is undercooked heck the cheeses that even melted on the omelettes vegetable omelettes have three pieces of vegetables on it I don't understand I am chef greasby and I approve this post"}
{"text":"How to say this in the most horrible location I've been to they're short order cook needs an attitude adjustment will yell at the guest for him messing up the orders will not complete the orders in the first place while waiting for the I guess assistant manager to get us the number for the district manager and corporate numbers a server came out and threatened us stating that we are causing a scene and will police will be called I stated that I am waiting for the manager to give us a phone number and she needs to zip it quote unquote so a server that has no Authority can come out and start running her mouth to guess while they're waiting for management to relay numbers when asked if she was a member of management she replied no I did not know that servers can threaten guest like this when it was The Cook's fault to begin with Wow messing up on the order my wife said she does not want to play anymore so the other server took it back to the cook and the cook basically said good f***** her. when the cook was asked where the rest of the order was he played dumb like there was no order and that was the end of the order when the table we were sitting had 7 people only 3 people got food and most of the food was burnt whatever you do stay away from this Denny's if you try to complain a server by the name of Rebecca will come out and threaten you when she wasn't even in the kitchen when it happened she was on a smoke break out back so do yourself a favor stay away from this location if you really want to eat Denny's go to the one on McDowell the management and service error is 10 times better"}
{"text":"The food was great and has excellent service. The waiter was slow getting to us to take our order but promised he would get our food to us fast. Our food came out in record time. Everything was great. But we had to wait in a very long line for way to long to pay our bill. Not really happy about that part."}

{"text":"I have visited this location several times since I live a couple miles up the road. It has never been remarkable but OK for a leisurely breakfast. My last experience was the final straw however.   I called in an order for pickup. The girl that answered the phone was rude. I told her I wanted to place an order to pickup and she said \"hold please\". She sat the phone down but did not actually place me on hold. I could hear all of the conversations she was having with other employees and guests (I think she was the cashier). I waited for over 5 minutes. I finally started yelling \"hello, hello, hello\" into the phone hoping she would remember that I was on the line.   I ended up hanging up. I tried to call back a couple of minutes later but kept getting a busy signal. Finally, I got an answer. It was the same girl. I told her I wanted to place an order for pickup. She passed me along to someone else. I explained to both of them that I had called previously, been put on hold, I could hear conversations happening, I was never acknowledged again, and that I felt the service was lacking that morning. The guy apologized and I did end up ordering but I told my husband what happened he told me not to pick up the food. So I didn't.   I will never ever go back to this Denny's. It is obviously mismanaged. Customers are not a priority."}
{"text":"I came to this location with a group of friends. The service was slow. I ordered an iced tea. The waitress told me she was brewing fresh tea so it would be a couple minutes. It was actually closer to 15 minutes. She never came around asking if we were ready to order. We ended up having to flag her down.   We actually got our orders in a timely manner but my toast was burnt. I know the cooks saw it. Obviously there is no accountability and no one to monitor quality control.   Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Filthy, food all over floor, service was terrible never brought syrup for pancakes... we had to get it from another person eating,  finally brought has browns at the end of the meal after us asking 3 times for them.  Server walks around saying I'm lost .         Server never checked back to see how food was.   Moons over my hammy bread was so hard I couldn't eat 1/2 of it.       Manger doesn't give a damn.   We used to eat here at least 3 times a week but the last 6 times were terrible.  A while back they upgraded the interior but the service and food went downhill.   Avoid this one at all cost. Go to the one 1 mile west off of I-10 and 75th you will be happier."}
{"text":"Normally, I am a huge fan of Denny's- it was the go-to hang out spot for my friends and I in high school and my favorite 2am dining spot in college. Needless to say, I have eaten quite a lot of Denny's fare in my life. Thus when I say that this is the worst Denny's I have been to, I mean it.  Out of all the different Denny's I've visited, this one is the bottom of the barrel. Which sucks, because I was really craving some good ol' cheap and tasty Denny's food.  During this visit, I ordered their Buffalo Chicken Strips and Biscuit n' Gravy (odd combo, I know).  The strips themselves were fine- they were crispy and decently well-coated in buffalo sauce. But the ranch dressing that came with them was horrible.  Normally, Denny's ranch is great because it's the runny, flavorful kind. This ranch was super thick and bland.  It almost didn't look like ranch dressing- more like a blob of white creamy goop. Ewww :( I had the same problem with the gravy on my Biscuit n' Gravy.  I don't know if they let it sit too long and thus it congealed, or if they just made it wrong, but the gravy was an almost solid blob- my biscuit was unable to absorb any of it and was thus too dry to be good.  Overall, it was quite unappetizing.  At least my poached eggs came out perfectly done."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I've ever had anywhere . I understand this is Denny's and I'm not expecting A-1 service or food and I am not one to complain unless things are that bad . I am a lead bartender at a 4 star hotel and been in the service industry for 18 years . No one at this location cares about guests or quality of food . First waitress took over 10 mins just to greet us with a section of 7 people including my party of three . Two out of three of us ordered drinks iced tea and a milkshake . She then asked if we were ready to order without even getting my sons drink order . I stopped her and told her he would like a root beer and we would like to order a half order of nachos . She went to retrieve beverages . Came back with two beverages and said the milkshake would be out shortly no big deal . I asked to Order and she said she needed a min . My iced tea tasted like tea mixed with collard greens water . Yuck . I Waited awhile for her to return after waiting awhile I had to go to host stand to let someone know and ask for a water and a Minute Maid juice . Awhile later she returned saying they were out of berry lemonade which is not what I ordered I tried to tell her and confirmed what I ordered was lemonade and they were out . Already annoyed I agreed and just asked for water . At this time we had already been there for 35 mins . She took our order and promptly put it in the pos . Our nachos which looked like a bowl of slop came out and she left started bussing tables . I flagged her down to ask again for my water which she never brought and some side plates and silverware for our appetizer . She did apologize and brought them in a timely manner . In between food coming out and ordering I once again had to get refills from host stand . Food came out my food had a grey hair in it and my sons steak was beyond we'll when he ordered medium . Which could have been the server not knowing about temp . He said medium she said \" medium what ? Medium well? Medium rare ?\" When be replied just medium she seemed confused . I again waited and when she didn't come check on food I went to host stand to find her and tell her about complaints and that I would t like anything else I've already been there for over a hour . This place was dead and I can see why . No one apologized or took accountability for anything . She took meals off bill . I had to ask for her to take off iced tea also . Bill was still $21 for beverages nachos and kids meal which was ok . I paid her at host stand . She couldn't figure out how to use computer I walked out without waiting for change which was just cents . I actually never not tip even if service is lackadaisical but today I just couldn't tip someone who doesn't care at all . I took my kids to Taco Bell after bc they were still hungry ."}
{"text":"I hate this location. Slow service with rude waiters. Never get refills on drinks, food over cooked and god forbid you come during shift change you cannot pay until the other shift comes in. Had to wait 17 minutes for the other shift to come in I felt like I was kidnapped. I was even using a credit card. I asked if I can leave the cash on the table and was told no I have to wait.  NEVER EVER COMING BACK HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I go to Denny's often (at least 12-15 times a month)  Yesterday Is the last time I go to Denny's.  My son and I came for what we thought was a quick breakfast, we got our food within 10 minutes, ate our food and was ready to leave at 5:48, waiter said you can't check out until 6:00. I went to get up and waiter said you have to wait here until 6! Computer is updating.  I was held at your Denny's for 12 minutes doing nothing but wasting my time. Waiter could of asked my to pay before the update instead of making me waiting at the table with dirty plates and two empty cups.  I have never been treated like this before.  Waiter tried to justify it by saying gas stations do this.  This may happen at other places but they tell you and you have a choice to stay or leave. Not held against your will. Had the waiter asked me to pay before he updated the register I would of been happy to pay rather then stay 12 minutes doing nothing."}
{"text":"John Sallie is on the tv screens here. I went to high school with that guy. I know you're saying to yourself \"who gives a shit\"' well, I don't give a rats ass EITHER! Nice guy from what I remember. Ahhh, the drunks are coming in ! Thank you Jesus for dinner and a show! I AM NOT worthy!"}
{"text":"Stopped here due to poor weather. This Denny's  is in a 1950's style diner.  Overall nice experience with a friendly feel.  Food the standard diner fare; service very good. Worth a stop."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, that's the best I can say. Service was terrible and everyone was cruel. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible! Terrible service, terrible food. Eggs were slimy, hash brows tasted like dirt, establishment was dirty, staff was extremely unprofessional. Never again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We were seated in 15 minutes on Valentine's Day at breakfast. Our server, Yoyo, was attentive and polite. Denny's always delivers!!!"}
{"text":"2 servants for table assignment and serving the whole dinner! Are you f**ing kiding me? Awful!! Pathetic!"}
{"text":"we totally loved our waitress who has the same first name as me: Barbara. She was very accomdating to us and very friendly. My boyfriend ordered a brownie with ice cream to go and she added chocolate syrup. he nearly told her that he loved her, lol. i was okay with it because she made us feel at home even though we were on vacation in another city. Thanks Barbara!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late night two in the morning chocolate shake the staff is very friendly Richard it was a great server just moved into the neighborhood I'll definitely be back for some late-night shakes"}
{"text":"Don't know why I keep going back there,but today we walked out. Went at about 1245, and the restaurant was not very busy. The section we were seated in had 2 tables yet to be given drinks, and a guest that had an empty glass on the edge waiting for a server to refil. After almost 15 min of no contact, we got up and left. Not one employee said a word as we got up,and walked out. For the record, myself, and my family grew up in food service. I have done every job in a restaurant, and a server will get 30 plus percent tip from me if I get good service. Even if we would have stayed, the server would have made something. News flash... you get squat if the customer leaves. I'm done with this location,and I sure hope the owner is made aware of how bad it is there."}
{"text":"This place is a joke,and should have the franchise pulled. Went in on Mothers day for lunch with my wife. ( it was 130, so it was not the lunch run)  I went to the restroom when we arrived, and even after the time to do that, we were never even aknowledged by any one in the restraunt. The  \" manager \" was dealing with someones bill at the counter, and decided that it was more inportant than to even say a word to us,or the family that came in before us. The total time ended up being at least 15 minutes. The sad thing is, they were not busy. Maybe 10 tables had people at them, and not one person that worked there said a single word.  I worked at a Dennys all through high school, and have worked in food service after. This experience was just plain unacceptable.  We went down the road to Village Inn.. needless to say, we had food quicker than what we waited total at Dennys.    Hey Dennys... two words for you  CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"We had come in after the Red Mountain Powwow, about 9pm. There was no one in the restaurant when we ordered. My food was the steak skewer skillet, where the only thing good on it was the bourbon sauce, the steak skewer was so over cooked it was sinewy. My friend ordered a salad and the waitress had to take it back because the chef put steak not chicken. While she waited for her salad the cook and the waitress were flirting back and forth. When she finally got her salad they had just taken the steak off the first salad and put chicken because we still found steak pieces in the salad. For a place with very few customers we had to wait longer than normal, while watching the waitress and staff arguing back and forth. I'm on the road a lot and have stopped at several Denny's but this one had below average service even for a Denny's."}
{"text":"This was my worst experience dining in Vegas. The service was terrible, no waiter/waitress  waited on our table for ten minutes, we had to leave in the end after asking to be served with no feedback. Will not eat at Denny's again!"}
{"text":"Pretty ordinary Dennys, didnt make it to the pancake special though dang it. Quite convenient to where we stayed at, motel 6. Not good nor bad, just Dennys."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I am a huge fan of Denny's. I eat at Denny's about once a week (can't beat that greasy diner food)! This location is the closest to my house and it used to be my favorite it town. You could say I was one of the regulars. Well, that has all changed!   Apparently the place is \"under new management\" and the new manager just plain sucks! I am a low-carb eater and one of the reasons I love Denny's is that they will accommodate me (by letting me sub broccoli for hashbrowns / toast / french fries). I have done this for years at Denny's locations all over the country (including this one) with no hassle whatsoever. Well, guess what? The \"new manager\" no longer allows this -- NOT EVEN WHEN I OFFERED TO PAY AN UPCHARGE TO HAVE A FRESH VEGETABLE INSTEAD OF POTATOES! What?   Second, my regular waitress informed me that the \"new manager\" will not allow them to bring out water in a big glass and will only allow them to bring out a teeny, tiny, miniscule glass of water -- ONE AT A TIME -- to customers who only order ice water to drink. See my photo of how tiny this glass is, it is absolutely ridiculous! Add that to the already understaffed and overworked servers and you are really making their lives miserable. I drink like a fish, especially when I want water. I felt so bad that our waitress had to keep running back to refill my midget-sized water glass every 3 minutes.   Since this happened, I've been back to Denny's at least 10 times but not this one. I'm not going to set food in this location ever again. I just don't get why some managers are SO shortsighted. You have alienated a long-time customer and believe me, I have told ALL of my friends about this."}
{"text":"I don't have much to add except that it's a Denny's! It's America's Diner! It's always open (and of course it's greasy and not super clean, it's Denny's for crying out loud). Great place to go if you have a hankerin' for a greasy burger or a big 'ol fatty breakfast! Love their whole wheat pancakes (ask for sugar free syrup on the side). I love my bacon super crispy and the cooks here know how to deliver."}
{"text":"This isn't the best Denny's (their food is slightly \"off\" compared to other locations) but it's attached to the Tahiti Village resort, so that is to be expected. It's a pain in the butt to park here since the lot is filled with resort guests. Sometimes you have to park next door at the Budget Suites and walk over. Since this location is located in a resort, the prices are slightly higher than off-resort locations.   I love Denny's and eat at them all over the country but this location has the worst service ever. I've been here several times and have had to wait to be greeted, to be seated, to be given menus, etc. It usually takes FOREVER for a server to even acknowledge you at all! The service problem here really needs to be addressed. Even when it's not busy you will wait and wait and wait. I was just here a few weeks ago around 10:30 pm and there were several employees and only ONE OTHER TABLE in the joint. We waited almost 15 minutes for somebody to greet us and take our order and then another 35 minutes to get 2 orders of pancakes. Yes, pancakes! That is the quickest food know to man to cook! Don't go here if you are short on time. Slow, slow, slow."}
{"text":"Fast service..piping hot...i ordered the supreme skillet over easy....eggs way overcooked.. 1 pc of spinach and maybe 1 sausage link...antrhing but supreme..been here multiple times..1sr crummy experience"}
{"text":"Denny's tends to be a paradox more and more. As the years go by the food is getting worse and worse. The deep fry things look aged and everything looks an automatic qualifier for a Cardiology appointment. But... very important but... the majority of the waitresses are really nice, you have free refill on coffee and other soft drinks and the classic diner ambiance you expect from Denny's. If only they could renew the looks and specially the food..."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cinnamon Pancake breakfast. My pancakes were overcooked, crunchy and hard to chew. My sunnyside up eggs were so overdone it took 3 tries with the fork to break the yolk. Otherwise the hash browns were great! My sausage links were harder than rocks and burnt.  My fianc√©e ordered the Santa Fe skillet but noted that her eggs were overdone as well.  The server was personable, but only came back to check on us once. I had to ask for Tabasco sauce 3 times.  I observed the restaurant manager yelling orders at his staff when the restaurant was not busy. No one should take verbal abuse like that at work or have to be micro-managed.  I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"This Dennys location rocks! I came in starving after A Hard Day's Work and they delivered one of the best breakfast Grand Slam meals I've ever had. the food was delicious and was everything that I wanted.thanks again."}
{"text":"We recently were visiting family in Phoenix, AZ for the Christmas holidays. While having eaten our Christmas Eve dinner early that day, shortly before 9pm, we found ourselves pretty hungry. The hotel we were at didn't have room service, so we started checking around to see what was open. Thank goodness Dennys was. We selected the one at 3205 W Bell Rd, and are sure glad we did. As we were walking to the entry, a woman leaving informed us there was a half hour wait. While it appeared to bother her we felt lucky it wasn't longer. Entering the restaurant, we were pleasantly greeted right away. The waitress apologized and said that the wait was about 15 minutes. She also apologized and said that the management was cooking but didn't explain why the regular cooks were not there. To make this a bit shorter than I could, suffice it to say, our waitress was extremely helpful and pleasant. While my husband ordered his favorite club sandwich, I took a chance that the Turkey dinner special might still be available. Not only was it, but both of our meals were excellent and served pretty quickly. I could not have enjoyed my turkey dinner more!! I never do this, but I actually took a picture of it (not great at this so I hope it posts ok!). We will definitely return there on our next visit!! By the Way / we're from Seattle."}
{"text":"Never going back. The first two visits, there were 4x as many servers vs. customers. Both times a server never came to our table, I had to flag down another table's server to help. Both times we were told \"she must be on break\" - service was still horrible. The third visit we waited over 20 minutes, no service again! No one even noticed my family walking out."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean, and gave me a free (tasty) grand slam for my birthday.  Awesome pancakes!"}
{"text":"The food is always great, the customer service is always awesome, I've been going here since a child and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I left. We were greeted, seated and drinks were brought out. Then...... nothing. we waited and waited. Crickets chirped, other customer came in. They were seated and drinks brought out for them. Then the last straw for me was when their waitress took their order, whilst ignoring us. So we decided to leave. I walked to the clerk, asked for the bill for the coffee. The hostess who seated us, asked what happened. We told her and she did try to get us to stay and comp our meal, but I was ticked and couldn't enjoy myself if I stayed. So we left."}
{"text":"NEVER EAT HERE! This place is horrible. The service SUCKS! They are so unorganized. We waited 20 min to order (only after I complained) and over an hr for our food. Everyone has an attitude. They do not care about their guests. They need to shut this place down."}
{"text":"You can tell you're at a great Dennys when everyone is old and this place is grandpa central! If you ever find yourself waking up hung over in Scottsdale on some random couch and there's a bunch of moms and babies and cats and dogs around and it's like 8 am and you can't really handle it just walk on down to Denny's and grab a skillet it's just a hop skip and a jump away!"}
{"text":"SMH where to start.... I wish I would have read the reviews before ordering but we were lazy and already on the road.   First off I called in a to-go order and the girl who helped me was really nice. Ordered the country fried steak meal, everyday slam and some extra sausage and pancakes. What I DID NOT order was the dawn pancake puppies thingy that I was charged for. Lucky for them it was only $2 so it was not worth my time and effort to complain about it, that's what yelp is for :)  Anyway,  the nice girl said that it would take 15-20 minutes which is understandable,  especially for a Sunday morning. Went in to pick up after 20 minutes...order not ready. 30 minutes, still nada. 45 minutes of waiting we finally receive the food. The hubby said our order came out in batches.   Got home, sure enough some food was cold, some still hot. The chicken fried steak was one of the worst I've ever had. The steak was tasted processed and the sauce on top very gelatinous.  The hash browns were overcooked and freezer burnt.  My sausage and pancakes were pretty good though. The eggs OMG tasted as if it was really really old. I've never experienced anything like it. I wanted to barf after one bite.   Now I know you shouldn't expect much from chain restaurants but the food should be at least decent. I honestly believe their ingredients used were well past their due date.   Please please stay away from this location. You don't want to risk getting sick."}
{"text":"Ordered moon over my hammy and it was disgusting! The chef was very heavy on the salt! You can never go wrong with pancakes though! Also ordered the blueberry hushpuppy things for the first time and they were burnt. Looked nothing like the picture but then again does anything ever look like the pictures?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty basic eating for your casino cafe dining.  I prefer this to the Coco's across the street at Texas Station only because at least here I know I won't be ignored.  The staff is usually friendly and you can see that they try really hard to make the most of your meal, even if you order off the 2-4-6-8 menu.  I never feel like they judge me even when I order like a real cheepo.    The last time I went in, I ordered something and all was fine until the server said they no longer had that item.  Okay, I order something else heavily modified because the lack of ingredients.  Again a few minutes later she comes back and says they were also out of that.  (It was a holiday themed meal, it's the holiday season, so now I'm a little miffed.)  So I order the same thing as what my husband has ordered, not really knowing what's in it, only knowing it has turkey and that's what I want.    The food comes out in little spurts because now the cook is really confused, so says the server.  We split the first sandwich and by the time the second comes I'm done.  It was just too greasy for me.  Later on after waiting a while for the check we just get up to pay seeing if they could print out the check up front.  They were able to but it was wrong, still having what I had first ordered on it.  The hostess begins to fix it and at this time the server comes up and they proceed to get into an argument about it because of the mix up the server doesn't want to charge me at all and the hostess is just not going to let that fly.    I didn't  care either way, it was nice of the server to try, but it wasn't like I was completely void of a meal.  Still eighteen dollars for two sandwiches seems steep for me especially at Denny's no less.  It's okay, this trip was a little off, but I've had better here before so I will probably be back."}
{"text":"This specific Denny's has not that great of service at all, it's not always clean it's def bottom on the totum pole, the one off I-17&Carefree Hwy is awesome. But the food is the same, and so is the prices so u go with what's closer."}
{"text":"I went to this Denny's only because it was on the way to where I was headed for the day.  It's a self standing not like the other two in the area which are in a mini-mall.  (Craig road and Anne road.)  It seemed busy but we were seated right away, which was nice.  However it pretty much went down hill from there.  I was brought the wrong drink and when I asked for it to be replaced I was given an iced tea with some kind of garbage in it.  Twice the waitress came by to ask how we were, but never stayed long enough at the table to let me answer.  That is beyond annoying, I'd rather just be ignored.  I made my husband ask the manager to take off my beverage since I never got to drink it.  He was polite enough to take off both drinks for us and apologized.  All the food was over cooked exept for the hashbrowns which were still cold, but I wasn't going to push my luck here.  Leave this place for all the truckers and go somewhere else for your Denny's fix."}
{"text":"So i had a horrible eat in here my waitress for got her name but she had a gap in her teeth her service was so bad the cook in the back had to replace our drinks while she stood behind the front counter the whole time we ate we even had to ask a different waiter for our check they should give negative stars"}
{"text":"This place is awful! They told us a 10-15 min wait. Which looked a little ambitious. But we gave them the benefit of the doubt. 30 min went by and we asked how much longer, they told us there was a few tables in front of us. After an hour we went back on and asked for an update and they told us they called us a long time ago which was funny since we had been waiting just outside the door with our kids. Denny's hostess staff you're a joke. Food was mediocre. But for Denny's what do you expect"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed.   Unless you're making a visit at the weeee hours of the morning after a late night at the bar, and you're taste buds are non existent and you're a.d.d. and don't mind waiting forever for food - this place was just horrible from taste to service.   FYI if you ever order a grilled cheese keep in mind they slap a tomato on it. UGH! I was disgusted. First of all I gag at the sight of tomatoes let alone the taste.Grilled cheese is not on the menu, but I figured when I asked for a grilled cheese it was just that. Bread with grilled cheese. Sorry I to vent but i was livid. I waited 45min for that and had to send it back.   two thumbs down"}
{"text":"Denny's is Denny's.  Eggs Bacon Sausage Hash browns Pancakes French toast And other breakfast items.  A wide array of lunch and dinner options too.  Service was good.  Remember the $2, $4, $6 & $8 value meals.  Nice, clean interior.  Looks like a newer location."}
{"text":"I'm eating breakfast and trying my best not to complain about service but it's hard not to, I'm with my friend after a long morning in the DMV and we just wanted to eat, my server was so rude, and just rushing our order, she didn't even let me finished telling her my order, so when she brought my order..., of course it was wrong and she even rolled her eyes like I was the one that was wrong, we just want to eat. So when she finally brought my order it looked weird. It wasn't a full order, I don't know but I won't be coming over at this location anymore, or I will just make sure we won't get the same waitress, her name is Diana, I'm a waitress at Bellagio and I didn't appreciate the horrible service, very disappointed"}
{"text":"Well, I don't normally eat at Denny's. But friends will drag me here from time to time and I just don't want to sit there and watch them eat, so I order something besides a beverage.   It was about noon when I hit up this location today, and I ordered the Bacon Avocado Breakfast Burrito...minus the bacon. Don't laugh, I have an intolerance of the stuff! Anyways, it took them a good while to make it, I didn't think it was that complicated to scramble up some eggs with cheese and then wrap it all in a tortilla with avocados and some tomato chunks and onions. Although, when it came out I was plenty hungry, and I enjoyed it. Who knew those things would go so great together. I asked for a side of hashbrowns, but it came out with fries, but I was like whatever, I like fries more than I like hasbrowns anyways.  The waitress that we had was hilarious she said that my friend looked like Vince Vaughn...which he doesn't. And then the nearby tables chimed in with their celebrities that they thought he looked like (Robert Pattinson, Brendan Fraser, etc.). Interesting people dining here to say the least, I'm sure at night it is even more so."}
{"text":"Pretty pathetic. Used to be good for a quick inexpensive breakfast. Over ten dollars now for an All American Slam AND pancakes are no longer included in the choice of bread, they are extra. Should make a good dent in the obesity problem."}
{"text":"Worst coustmer service ever asked for a quiet table they told me no the bring me a syrup bottle from family dollar with less then a sip of syrup in the damn thing will never spend money here again the night shift crew"}
{"text":"Worst Denny's ever! DO NOT GO HERE I got sick from the food and the tables they sit you at aren't clean. They never answer there phone I literally called for one hour before I came. It was an hour wait unbelievable"}
{"text":"I now know why Columbus doesn't have much if any Denny's left.  I used to love to go to Denny's, but this visit was not reminiscent..... The french fries were tasteless, and the mozzarella sticks were still solid in the middle.  The quesadilla and chicken fingers were edible. Don't chose this location simply because of the location."}
{"text":"After 5 years of being here every Friday with a networking group I am no longer returning and my group of 30 business owners are not either.   New owners are owners who are number people only and do not care about the customers or staff.   The lesson for them will be when they see the numbers are dependant on people. ... The same people they care little for."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday for morning breakfast and coffee. Restaurant was about half full. We were seated immediately but the server didn't come over for our drink order for 5 minutes or more. We could see 4-5 other servers all hanging out talking near the counter with several of them looking over to our table but nobody seemed to want to work. After he finally took our drink order he proceeded to help other tables but we never got our drinks or our food order taken. after another 10 minutes we got up and left, I informed the hostess up front who said...oh sorry about that, her tone in her voice came across as she couldn't care less. This is the only Denny's in the far northwest of Vegas, I suggest you take an extra drive to find another one or eat at one of the casinos nearby."}
{"text":"The. Worst. Breakfast. Ever.! I know it's not supposed to be a 5 star restaurant but it was really bad."}
{"text":"The best service yet in Buckeye. Ask for Shallom he was amazing.  Whole new menu with the most delicious new items. Try the sticky bun pancakes they're the best. And all with a 15% AARP discount.  would have got 5 stars but no bottled water. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go. I've definitely seen worse Denny's. The stag is very friendly and the restaurant was clean. I would recommend this Denny's if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We came in like at 10:25, we waited for someone to sit us down.. tha manager just kept walking in front of us not even asking if we had been helped! 10:40 came around and I asked the manager if they were going to sit us anytime soon? He answer \"I only have 3 tables for big parties\" but yet he had 2 tables open to sit 6 grown ups and 1 baby!!! We just decided to leave since he didn't care to help.."}
{"text":"I took my kids out for dinner and I have never been so unhappy with restaurant service. We will never be returning to this location. Just before we were seated the waiter and the manager were arguing, loudly and all the patrons could hear this. The patrons were all siding with the waiter, the manager was in the wrong. The waiter took our drink/food order and was fired before we even had our drinks. This left one waitress to handle the entire restaurant. The dishwasher(who was absolutely wonderful) brought our food and even bought my kids the special kids cups with a drink. I emailed corporate and never got a response. As wonderful as the dishwasher was the experience was terrible. I feel from the brief interaction with the dishwasher that he should be the manager."}
{"text":"It's not the greatest food you will ever eat but this location has a very friendly staff and very clean environment. It's a great place for kids and if you go on a kids eat free night that's an extra perk!"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever received. My friend and I ordered basic breakfast items, nothing fancy. Took 45 minutes to get our food and a party of 10 who came in after us received all of their food before us. My food was extremely greasy with burnt and undercooked skillet potatoes. My friend was missing half her food, what food was there was cold, her sausage was undercooked (still pink in the middle) never once received refills on our water and when we finally tracked down another waiter to get our check so we could finally leave after being there for almost 2 hours and they gave us the wrong table check. Our original waitress finally showed up and sat down next to me in my booth and proceeded to tell me about how hard her night is and how she's so sorry and she's was having an off night and just wanted to go home and sleep. I would have felt bad but I just wanted to leave and enjoy what was left of my night. I waited almost 20 more minutes to speak to the manager. Never in my life have a wanted to leave before paying, they would have deserved it. Finally spoke to the manager and explained everything. He apologized and said hopefully we'll have a better experience next time (sorry to burst your bubble but I won't ever be back) I was nice at first but that kind of response from a manager is ridiculous. I told him I wanted compensation for my time and money wasted. He said he'd offer me my food half price. He charged me both meals at a 50% employee discount (according to my receipt) and walked off. I ended up leaving the pen and signed receipt on the keyboard of the register since he walked off and never came back.   This place is a joke from management to the food."}
{"text":"One of the only reasonably priced eating establishments on the Vegas Strip. Nothing  fancy but it gets the job done. It goes without saying the place is slammed with customers from opening til closing. The staff seems to be very hard working and busy all the time. Everyone was courteous and helpful to the patrons. ..even the drunk and irate ones."}
{"text":"One sunny afternoon me and a friend decided to grab Sunday brunch at this newly open Denny's. Upon arrival parking was easily accessible, and it did it appear to  be at full capacity. After entering the establishment there was numerous groups of family's waiting to be seated. We placed our name on the waiting list and was told it would be 5-10 minute wait. After further observation of the dining area they were seats available, but all contained dirty dishes.  So after waiting 35 minutes to be seated. Things moved at a reasonable pace for a diner. Food and drinks arrived in a timely manner, but it seemed like an eternity to receive our cutlery. So I would say our waiter was \"OK\".   The waiter assured us that we return to Denny's on a LESS busy day, to get better service.   Our food: my over easy eggs were a little overdone, but everything else was just fine.   My friend stated his hamburger was a little bland, but enjoyed the seasoned fries.   Just a few things I want to add: the overall cleanliness of this Denny's and the waitstaff I would give them a 4 out of 10. I observed our waiter spill water on the floor in front of a patrons table, and didn't clean it up.   I think this location just needs some time to iron out their customer service. Maybe a new management team."}
{"text":"After a particularly horrible experience at Denny's several years ago, I swore I'd never go back. I finally weakened and visited this restaurant for dessert this evening at about midnight. We wanted a piece of pie. You can't ruin pie, right? Wrong.  We were seated promptly and given a dessert menu in the nearly-empty restaurant. After that, nothing for about 15 minutes. Not even a glass of water. At length, a pleasant young man took our dessert order. I asked for a hot fudge sundae and my companion ordered apple pie (the only pie they serve, it turns out).  My dessert came first. I was informed they were out of whipped cream, but that's okay. A little odd, but okay. After another five minutes, the pie arrived. The time gap was a bit strange, but that's okay too.  I tasted my sundae. The hot fudge was neither hot nor fudge. I'm not sure what it was. It tasted vaguely like chocolate, but it was entirely without sweetness and decidedly unappetizing. I sent it back, which was accepted cheerfully, and my companion and I jointly decided to share the pie.  The pie was delicious! The presentation was horrible. It looked like it was scooped out by hand and dumped on the plate. But at least it tasted good. We enjoyed it.  We also ordered coffee. It was hot and tasty.  I can't recommend this place. Never again."}
{"text":"I agree the service was slow, it seemed that the morning shift didn't arrive until 10 minutes after we got there (~8:45).  Food was average, cheap and filling, what you'd expect from a Denny's."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Denny's in years and my kids wanted to try it out for dinner. We brought our friend with us too! When we got there they were short staffed and we were told to seat ourselves. Honestly the place could be spruced up but my 5 stars is for the excellent service and food. David was the one who helped us and explained he was waiting for his server...he was the manager on duty so he was running around helping all 6-7 tables working hard to accommodate everyone. Even though it was busy, it didn't affect his service. He was very friendly, polite, thoughtful, and apologized    for being short staffed. (Someone called in sick, so he was waiting for a replacement) He still had a smile on his face and checked on us often. He was genuine in his interaction, and fun to talk to! We ordered a bunch of food because everything looked good. A mix of breakfast and dinner lol. Everything was cooked to perfection! My favorite was the grand slam burger, fries and seasoned fries with ranch yummy oh and the hush puppies too! Will be back to this Denny's. Probably after many gym sessions first though"}
{"text":"AVOID. For some reason, everytime I eat here I always get sick. The place is not exactly clean. The kitchen looks disgusting. This is perhaps the worst Denny's restaurant in existence. We regularly stop in, not by choice but due to a family member's preference for this horrible, horrible restaurant.  Well... the food quality is adequate, but smaller than usual portions... and the service is nonexistent. For example:  It's 5 p.m. and there are two employees on duty and that includes the cook. It will take 20 or 30 minutes simply to get a glass of water. 30-45 for appetizers. 2-3 hours for the full meal (not including the time it takes to eat it.)  If you want to eat something, plan on waiting. To be clear, this is not a fault of the waitresses, this is a chronic management problem.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Go to the Village Inn, go to McDonald's, go anywhere else but here. The only reason why this Denny's is still in business is because seniors obviously have extremely low standards and cannot perceive the passage of time. It shouldn't take 3 hours to have a freaking meal unless it's Thanksgiving.  The management and staff who work at this restaurant at absolutely no pride in themselves whatsoever.  They're only there to pick up a paycheck, work as less as possible, and leave. Denny's Corporation is a joke. Luckily, for the managers, the senior citizens who frequent this restaurant are extremely apathetic and don't complain. That's the only reasonable explanation why this restaurant is still in business."}
{"text":"I'm a local and eat here quite often. The staff turnover is quite low and they know our usual requests. The food is always consistent, and I think pretty good. Fried eggs tend to be on the runny side, so our over-easy family always orders over-medium. My favorite right now is the breakfast wrap with the bacon and avocado. YUM! We usually order breakfast or hamburgers, though I enjoy the tilapia as well. The few times we've had the t-bone or shrimp, they've done well with them. We also love the late-night menu but don't get there very often during those hours. While just a \"Denny's\", it's one of the better restaurants in our small town (unless you're looking for Mexican, then you'd better head to Potros!). They have booths and tables; tables can be joined together for larger groups. Can be busy on Sunday after church. They have a great kids' menu and kids eat free on Tuesdays. They also have a seniors' menu that offers slightly smaller portions for less money and you don't have to be a senior to order them. Open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Went to this location with a group of friends late night. Never again. Took over 30 minutes to place our food order. Waiter showed his frustration through the night. Waiter also sat down to talk with his friends vs serving us. Drink never filled. Food was cold and over cooked. When asked to speak with the manager, the hostess said he's walking around here somewhere if we can catch him. Save your time and money and go to the Denny's on 32nd street or Village inn on Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A good place for brunch/ lunch. The servers are great with good service with smile. If the parking at front is full, go to the rear, there's ample parking there.  I had Grilled Salmon... it came on a sizzling platter with vegetables. The serving style gets 4.5 and taste gets 3.5 out of 5. Overall a nice experience for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best Denny's I've been!! The staff are excellent. The server was courteous, friendly and helpful, with excellent service.  The place is clean and well maintained.   I had the veggie Omelette with spinach, mushrooms, tomato and cheddar cheese... it was good! This Denny's can definitely be recommended for a place to have brunch and quick good food, especially in odd hours"}
{"text":"After not eating Denny's for at least 15yrs we decided to give it a try rather than our usual which is IHOP.  This morning my stomach is regretting it.  Went around 10pm last night, place wasn't very busy. Hostess asked us to wait for a minute which was actually about 15min. Place seemed really dirty, kept getting whiffs of dirty carpet smell. Food was good but not great. Hash browns and eggs where actually really good.  Three stars because they did have a decent value menu like biscuits and gravy meal for $4."}
{"text":"Wish I could have given zero stars--Very disappointed . I ordered from here through Ubereats so that my food can be delivered. I ordered 2 Grand slam sluggers with a side of grits . I only received 1 grand slam sluggers and the side of grits. Denny's totally disregarded my order as it I right there in you screen the quantity of food you order . My total was about $30. That's issue number 1. Number 2, my estimated delivery time was changed twice . Lastly, when my food arrived , it was cold and I live fairly close to the location ( about 5 mins away) and because Ubereats offer a tracker to watch your food the driver arrived in about 7 mins from the time my order left the restaurant. I contacted Ubereats and I was issued a refund but I'm very disappointed because I ordered this meal for my mother and I to enjoy a nice Mother's Day breakfast together without the hassle of leaving home . Sorry not sorry I'll never return again after this"}
{"text":"Oh Denny's - how you never fail to disappoint.  Waited 35 minutes for breakfast at 10:30 this morning.  Had to ask for water and refills on coffee and tea.  When asked to speak to the Manager - he was found sitting at the counter visiting with a friend.  No apology.  Unbussed tables, wait staff scrambling.  Manager.....not caring.  He ended up coming to our table with an insincere apology and lack of concern, but no hesitation to give away corporate money to cover his inability to manage his staff."}
{"text":"I know it's just Denny's and my expectations shouldn't be high but this was the worst experience I've ever encountered and I have a high tolerance level. We were seated near the hostess station and had to constantly listen to them shout out names. The food took ridiculously long to come to the table and the clientele was less than endearing. We had two folks sitting next to us who were basically coughing on our food. We threw in the towel and left having not eaten a single bite (we did pay and tip). I would NEVER return here no matter how hungry I am!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Dennys in the southwest. Beth, our service is super friendly as well as attentive, always ready with the  coffee and soda refills. Food is bomb too! 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"This would have been a 5 star based on our last visit, but so-so previous visits would not allow it...not yet. As for the last visit (8-8-2017) everything was excellent. Our server, Sharlotte, was amazing! She really took care of us. Very energetic, friendly and efficient! The Fit fare omelette was the best I've had at Denny's. Will return...but I'll call first to see if Sharlotte is working."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Didn't get one refill on my drink throughout my stay. It took about 40 minutes to get my food and she forgot to put my pancakes in so it then took her 20 minutes to bring those to me. Overall horrible service. Choose a different Denny's. Wish I could give no stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I always visit this location since we live close by and it's always open after we get off work. It has some good food and great service. We normally get a server named TRACY. She's very friendly, keeps you notified on when the food will arrive, refills drinks when a little below half (not empty like most waitresses wait for), is attentive to our needs and ALWAYS gets our orders correct! I would recommend her if you ever stop by in the evenings.  Price is wonderful and food is hot, tasty and fulfilling!"}
{"text":"Today is my birthday and we decided to come to Denny's to get some dinner at around 9:30pm. The staff definitely needs some extensive customer service training.   Complaints: The hostess with black shoulder length hair, treated us like we were invisible. There was no hello, no welcoming gesture, no eye contact.  The hostess was going to give us a dirty booth table.   The server Kathryn got our orders right. However, she had no time to check up on us after food arrived after 30 minutes.  Our table had no utensils. My steak was over cooked. My steak knife arrived when all my other guests had finished eating their food. I asked for A1 sauce, and another guy server handed me a bottle with 4 drops left.  We basically had to wave our hands for about 10 minutes until someone can notice that you need anything.   Lastly, we were charged my complimentary birthday meal, after Kathryn had repeatedly confirmed that it is complimentary.  We complained to the manager. He listened and apologized. However, it was not handled properly. He asked us if it's ok for him to refund us the amount charged for the complimentary meal. That was already given, that it should be refunded.   I hope that corporate finds time to work on consistency in service and management, because this branch in Vegas is definitely overlooked."}
{"text":"09/26/2017 location in front of sunrise children hospital  My wife was having surgery, I came to this location to have. Breakfast 7.30am Before I order the food I went to restroom wash my hand wow homeless man was in restroom and he was bleeding and he told me he was there since last night, informed server Linda about that guy they didn't do anything  Also when we get hot tea my cup was so dirty  I asked her and she gave me another one that also the same  When I order Swiss cheese omelet she (server Linda) told me they do not have Swiss cheese what kind of restaurant is this very poor service"}
{"text":"Served my English muffin and grits with margarine without asking - and had no butter.  Check out during am rush was delayed 10 min due to system \"updating\""}
{"text":"I placed an online order, waited for over an hour for them to tell me they never received it. This was after the lady told me it wasn't ready yet. I will never go here again!!!! I ended up getting a refund and no food!!"}
{"text":"Service sucked, waited 10min no waiter came had to flag hostess down. Ordered chicken fried steak had texture of what I would think chewing on a condom. White gravy taste like the white glue from elementary school"}
{"text":"So pissed! Entered the place around 5:50pm, the waiter took our order for drinks and never came back. At 6:40pm my husband and I got up and left... There were two waiters and the place wasn't even busy...? Never going back to this Denny's! Horrible experience! We complain to the host and she said the drinks were on the house and apologized..."}
{"text":"This is a really nice Denny's, conveniently located right next to the Hampton In.. You get 15% off with your AARP card, but tell them up font because there are no do-overs once the bill is totaled. Not their fault - it's a computer thing. Kinda lame, but I don't blame them.  Food was good and to go order was 100% accurate. High marks for that, since it almost never happens anywhere else I seem to go."}
{"text":"I'm not too crazy about writing chain business Yelp reviews, but I still do them - just because...  Denny's never, ever lets me down. Ever. Their breakfast menu items are SO good and fairly priced across the board. Lunch and dinner items are tasty as well but I prefer breakfast here for some reason.  I know exactly what I'm walking into once I enter through the glass doors and walk onto their signature dark green carpet, and it's consistently delivered. Great service, freshly brewed coffee, hot and tasty breakfasts, and a great start for the day.  A couple of my favorite menu items:  -Moons over my Hammy (never gets old and makes a decent leftover if you put remaining sandwich in oven at home)  -Ultimate Omelette (lots of protein and crunchy veggies here)  -T-Bone steak (not as good as my dad's BBQ steak, but I love their seasoning here)  -Various salads (I've never had a salad at Denny's that was not well-distributed and didn't appear fresh)"}
{"text":"This is a big, clean Denny's. It is well staffed and very clean. Service was friendly and my food came out fast. Fast enough that I was able to go to an earlier church service than I had planned on after I had finished my breakfast.  I ordered one of the Slam breakfasts. Two hot and fluffy  pancakes, two strips of crispy bacon, two links of sausage, two eggs (scrambled) and hash browns.  The hash browns could have used a couple more minutes of browning bit they were still good. A cup or two of hot tea to wash it all down and I was set to begin my day. Thank you Denny's."}
{"text":"Not near as horrifying as I anticipated.. Not a place I would recommend , or ever come back To on purpose , but definitely survivable . We were a party of 18 so I understand it takes awhile to get the food out . We waited apx an hour , we were served in groups of 4 so we didn't all eat at the same time . My fries were ice cold and tasteless , but the chicken Sammy was decent . My moms onion rings were hot and fresh. My bf nachos looked like a broke college kid cobbled it together with leftovers he stole from his roommates ( nothing like The pic on the menu ) but he's a fatty and ate it anyway.  Buyer beware ! but then again if you are dining at Denny's chances are you are either drunk & looking to sober up , or on a road trip and there is nowhere else in the free world to eat."}
{"text":"We were a party of 7 yesterday 01/02/15 at apx 5 pm. The restaurant was busy , but there seemed to be plenty of staff. It took 45 minutes to get our order and what we got wasn't worth waiting for . Nothing was hot , nothing was fresh and my boyfriend was served 1 piece of bacon when he ordered double bacon ?!! Seriously? Who plates 1 piece of bacon and assumes the order is correct ? I realize going to a Denny's means you aren't going to get a gourmet meal, however,  I did foolishly expect a hot , fresh meal. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on this place ."}
{"text":"I have a strict self-enforced policy on not reviewing the larger chain establishments but I feel a review for this Denny's location is warranted.    Denny's may not be a true retro-diner but I still get that diner feel from it.  From the stainless steel walls behind the bar to the 50's music I so dearly love.  And the food is not bad.  I don't believe food needs to be unique or gourmet to be good.  I ordered a mushroom swiss burger and it arrived at my table in just a few minutes.  It looked to be a hand formed patty.  It was not anything close to round and was falling apart a bit.  Perfect if you ask me.  It was like eating a home made burger.  It was big and filling.  My usual go-to if I find myself at Denny's.  Since it was Memorial Day and I was feeling good and relaxed, I ordered a hot fudge brownie a la mode.  Vanilla ice cream on it's own, no thank you.  But mix that scoop with some hot fudge and a warm brownie, aaaaahhhh.   So good.    My service was good for the most part except for when my server disappeared for a few minutes.  No matter though, it gave me time to digest before ordering dessert.  When he was there he was very attentive and personable.  Being Memorial Day the restaurant was not at all busy.  The staff had no urgancy to get the customers in and out.  I was told I could stay as long as I wanted.  I never felt like cattle in a processing plant.  That is for sure.  Denny's has raised their prices a lot in recent years so it is not a go-to for a cheap sit-down experience anymore but it is still good."}
{"text":"My wife and I use to be regulars here for a while. We had a bad habit of going at 10pm and then going home  and going to bed. Im happy to say we dont really do that anymore thank god, but some of that reason besides being better for us health wise is the last and final time we were there. I like to feel Im a forgiving person when it comes to a place I have been to before and it was fine, but I just couldnt get back onboard. We came in and took a seat in a booth that we could only stay in for a couple minutes because it just got boiling hot. We moved to a table that was maybe a degree cooler but it wasnt much better. While this is happening we still havent seen our waiter or really anyone at this point. I could hear them in the back but I dont go back there to eat I have to eat out here. About 5 minutes goes by of just sitting and playing patty cake with my wife and someone finally comes to the table and offers to get us some drinks. I like drinks. Drinks are a good thing to have. Right? Can you get water wrong? Why yes you can. We get our water and there is one of those flying ants right on the top floating around. I think it was dead or just really relaxed in the bath, but either way it was gross. I was done at that point and we just walked out. It makes me sad to think of all the other late night fatty meals me and my wife had there and what could have been in our food or in our drinks that I didnt notice. I gave it 2 stars atleast because its like thinking of an ex wife. What a bitch! but we did have some good times when she wasnt trying to make me drink bugs."}
{"text":"zero stars horrible service  .. i hate to bring the race card but the white server seem to not serve us mexicans... not cool."}
{"text":"Tried to go in this morning and buy a gift card for my Wife's Grandmother.  None of the cashiers knew how to process it and the Manager would not come out to help.  You just lost out on an easy $50."}
{"text":"We go to dennys probably once every couple months as a cheap after movie dinner with family. Never expect a 5 star experience, but a good solid cheap eats. This was worst experience I've had at one. Only gave it one star because the waitress was friendly, albeit inept. At a table of 2, both orders came wrong. Waitress smiled and said \"I'm sorry\" & started to walk away. I handed her my plate to fix and asked her again to bring my sons eggs the way he ordered (over easy instead of scrambled ). She never brought syrup or butter for the pancakes. Got our drinks and food at same time. She never checked back until I flagged her down for to go boxes and the check. No refills. Heard her apologizing to several other tables. They were about 1/2 full. Arrived 11am so not peak time even."}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience I've had in a while. We waited almost an hour for our food. The whole time the waitress never said anything even while refilling my coffee. I could hear children at other tables saying where's my food I'm hungry. When we finally got our food the waitress nonchalantly said \"oh, sorry it took forever\". The food was sub par to say the least not to mention they forgot half of my girlfriend's meal. Will not be returning to this Denny's ever again."}
{"text":"The service was the worst ever. Our server never came and got our order, we ended up getting served by someone else. Then our server never once comes and checks on us because he's too busy fighting with another waitress and because she speaks Spanish calls her Consuelo which is insulting to that poor women. He's too busy fighting about a table and didn't  get our orders.   We were a party of 9 divided into 2 separate areas which is understandable. We waited a good hour before we got our food and I am being generous of the time. Our other party goy their food and drinks r8ght away, they had to wait for us to finish in order for us to get going. Yes Vegas is hectic but if you can't handle the rush or the different languages and such then get out of the service industry and work somewhere else.  We tried to get the hostess attention but never  once acknowledge us as well while she was seating people down.   That really out a damper on our vacation to start with."}
{"text":"Gave it another go and I was, once again, extremely disappointed. The wait staff was slow and not very welcoming. Our food took forever to come out and at the end of our meal we basically had to beg for the check. It took out waitress 15 minutes to get it to us. She actually handed us the wrong check for $5 more than our meals were worth and insisted that it was another tables check but they were the same price. Nice try. The manager tried to fix it by going us a discount, which I appreciated, but I still won't be going back. Every one deserves a second chance but they blew it again."}
{"text":"Man i just had the best PRIME RIB PHILLY CHEESE STEAK SANDWICH, I ever ate sorry POP's but Denny got you beat on this one. And my hubby had the Pot Roast melt. That was sooo good too. Keep up the good work Denny's."}
{"text":"The server my siblings and I had coughed on our food right in front of us. It wasn't busy at all and the food took like 45 minutes to get out to us. We were starving. The server didn't apologize for the long wait either."}
{"text":"I'm so tired of finding decent places for breakfast that go downhill fast within a couple months. I know it's just Denny's. Nothing overly special. But, they had an amazing manager named Linda who was the reason we continued to go there. She was great at her job. She ensured everything ran smoothly. She was respectful to her staff and she didn't hesitate to jump in wherever she was need. Today, we went in and learned Linda is gone. It showed. We waited an hour for our food which never came up. There was no acknowledgement by the new manager. Not even when we walked out. And the worst part is we were sitting at the counter, right in front of everyone and were completely ignored after getting our drinks and putting in our order. So, now we are on the hunt for a new breakfast place. Any suggestions are appreciated."}
{"text":"Megan the cook/ busser/ server, She does it all with such a great attitude. Unfortunately our server left us over 15 mins waiting with no drinks and unattended. Megan thank you so much you are amazing you need to give this girl a raise!! Lol Xoxo Sierra Family"}
{"text":"I came here last night to get my thanksgiving pecan pie grub on and was pretty darn disappointed.  My waitress was great and did an excellent job at serving me, but my food was just down right bad.  I came here just to get a slice of pie and some coffee and unfortunately Denny's couldn't even manage to get it right.  At first I was excited when I saw my pecan pie, but then when I started eating it I noticed that it was pretty hard and it had an after taste of old stale dough.  The texture and the taste gave me the impression that this pie has been sitting in the fridge for an extremely long time.  I know that Denny's isn't known for high quality food, but the least this establishment can do is serve a fresh decent slice of pie. It's not that freaking hard, but hey that's what you'll get when your only paying $2.  Overall I'll never come here again for a slice of pie. It was just disgusting and for the record this small lovely slice of pie will run you 730 calories. Yikes!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Denny's a handful of times and I really like it.  The people are friendly and accurate with your order and the food has always been fresh and tasty.  I usually order breakfast and it always turns out the way it's suppose to and just the way I order it.  I also like the fact that this Denny's is not as busy as most and the food comes out quickly.  Overall this spot is a great place to come for breakfast and late night meal with friends."}
{"text":"At the door we had great service as we were going to be seated we asked If we could sit in the back do to the fact that we were having a business conversation. The waitress Lauren snapped at the kind lady seating us who had no issue with us sitting at the other table. She then took extra long to come check in with us for drinks as well as take our order. There is no one in this place at this hour but 2 other tables. No reason for anyone to be so rude to the people they work with let alone the customers. I guess that's what you get here at Dennys. I get its a low dollar place and very early in the morning but that is no reason to be rude.."}
{"text":"It took forever to get our food, but the server was really nice. The manager gave us a $5.00 off to compensate the hour we waited for our food after we ordered (not even exaggerating). I felt real bad for the server because I could tell the kitchen is the one that messed it up. He even checked up on it twice and they failed to make it twice. After getting it, my boyfriend's food was salty. But hey, it's Denny's. As for my avocado burrito, that's what the one star is for. It was yummy. I couldn't believe Denny's could be botched up. But now I know, it sure can!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!! Waited 20 minutes to have our drink order taken. Took another 20 minutes to actually receive our drinks.  It wasn't overly crowded so I don't understand what the hold up could have been. Food order also took long, all to have the our food order come out wrong. Over medium eggs were undercooked. Pretty much raw. Overall horrible experience. Would never think of coming to this Denny's. Sticking to IHOP. Don't bother ruining your Vegas stay by coming here."}
{"text":"This is a Denny's. If you are unsure what that means, you might be impressed with the decor or even the taste of the food. The cooks here are pretty good. Definitely not the worst Denny's I've been to. To say that nothing's better would be ridiculous..."}
{"text":"Ok, wasn't even going to leave a review, but i feel like this is something people should watch out for. We came in and were seated right away, our waitress  (Linda, I believe) was sweet & totally on top of making sure we were alright, food was good, not the worst Denny's I've been to. Everything was cool up until the end of our meal. My only serious problem was when i went to pay our check. My total was $19.  I left two dollars on the table since it was the only cash i had, and i put $2 on my card for the rest of the tip.  When I was walking out I noticed that (Lilly, I think) the hostess charged $26 to my card? What?! I wrote in the total on the receipt, $21.  She charged me $7 for gratuity. On a $19 tab? I went back in and pointed it out to her & she didnt even seem shocked. Just the dumb \"oh, my bad, i thought thats what it said\" 2....7.... 21....26....? How do you confuse that? I ended up leaving it because I was too annoyed to deal with her & our waitress was super awesome.  But still, seriously take a second glance at your receipt after you pay.  As for you little hostess, you need to be more careful when handling peoples money. Some people cant afford a $7 tip on a $19 tab."}
{"text":"This place is my life.  the food is amazing I've never had such good Italian food in my life the lasagna was to die for and the breadsticks were perfect and buttery.  While being a bit expensive the Shrimp Alfredo is the best thing on the menu no wonder this place has so many awards for cleanliness and quality of food."}
{"text":"If I could give this Denny's a negative rating I would. The lady sat us down and then we proceeded to wait for a server that never came. I had to ask for a server to come take our drink orders. Then we waited 45 minutes and never got our food!! A group that got there after Us Got their food before us and the manager said that it was because they ordered before us... In the end wale said fuck it and walked out without ever getting our food. Such a frustrating experience!!!! Will never visit this Denny's again!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there on NY weekend Saturday. The hostess was friendly, lots of smiles here, and asked if we were okay sitting a table in the back. We asked for a booth and were placed at one of those 2 person booths, kind of a squeeze. Our menus banged on the condiments. We ordered two draft beers, and they were flat so we told them right away, then ordered other ones and they were flat, too. Kindly, they only charged us for the second set of flat beers!  We ordered cups of chili, but they did not come. Our entrees arrived. I asked about the chili and our server said she was sorry. She said she was so preoccupied with the beer situation that she forgot. The burgers were of good size. We found gristle in each one, and my wife found a bone in hers, but I guess that's par for the course for economy burgers these days, isn't it? The porter who delivered the burgers asked if we wanted hot sauce, then came back with a bottle with about 3 shakes left in it. \"Is that okay?\" he asked. If your server asks if something is okay, he/she knows the answer!  The fries were pretty good, though some of mine were under-cooked and they don't have malt vinegar. The capper was the bill. You have to write down your tip prior to the waitress processing the card. She became much more officious when she discovered she received a mere 15% tip. I noticed other people sending back food that was missing little things, like the toppings they ordered on their specialty pancakes. I would recommend giving this Denny's time to figure out it's issues. Eat is great and down the street, and Hennessy's is across the street and has a great burger. Both have better food for roughly the same price. This place may be great once Denny's closes and something else opens up in it's place!"}
{"text":"Me and the boyfriend went down to Denny's for some breakfast food. The food was okay, but the service wasn't that great. We went to the Denny's down in Crowfoot and we asked the waiter for water refills and he said sure. Then he decided to distract himself with other things, and no, it was not really that busy. He was talking to another coworker as well while making eye contact with us. Unsure if whether he was going to come back, we asked a waitress passing by if she could give us a refill and she did. Someone from another section had to get us what we needed, and don't get me wrong, we aren't impatient. We waited for the guy for about 10 minutes before we decided to ask someone else, and we asked someone else because it appeared that he was too busy standing at the front door looking back at us. Anyways, it was not the best experience, but thanks to the girl that gave us our refill."}
{"text":"We came here for the \"build your own\" pancake deal, after leaving another location that smelled funny & where we were stood without being seated or noticed for a few minutes. This location took care of us! The food was excellent & our server was great - even refilling drinks without asking. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Smelled like pee, had tweekers standing outside looking like they couldn't wait to break into your car the minute you walked inside & no one noticed us or seated us so we left. Won't go back there ever again."}
{"text":"I have been to this Denny's twice. Once today, and once last Sunday. What a difference a week makes. Both times I went on Sunday morning. Last week the place was \"busy\" and I sat the bar since I was by myself and prefer to watch something on the TV, sports or CP24. They had a manager behind the counter who was in charge of training, and it was obvious because she knew what she was doing and her name tag stated it as well. So my experience was alright, not amazing but alright.Enough to make me come back.  Well one week later (today), I went back. Same time in the morning and it wasn't that busy at all. Once again I sat at the bar. There are 2 televisions, one at either end. The one closer to me, had nothing on the screen, it may as well been turned off since there was nothing on it, the other tv was showing some random soccer game from somewhere in the middle east. So as I sat there at the bar with my menu, I wasn't greeted by anyone. Wasn't even acknowledged. Not even a minute later, as I'm staring at the menu a manager approached me with a bowl of food that clearly I did not order and then tried to pass it off to someone else before getting to the other end of the bar and asking a server where it should go. That was the only contact I had with anyone besides the person who sat me.  As I sat there with my menu closed in front me of waiting to be served or even spoken to, I had the pleasure of listening to a group of servers staring at a binder complaining about their sections. So they called over Joe, who was the manager behind the counter and then began giving Joe a hard time about their sections, tables or lack there of. Joe did his best to \"look at it\", all this going on while I continued to pat my hands on the bar, make eye contact with someone who worked there and at least try to get some service.   None of that worked and since no one seemed to know I was there, I stood up, grabbed my jacket and walked out. As I walked by the host stand where about 4 servers were standing around, I could hear them giggling to themselves because like me, they also knew this place was a joke and so is their service.  Better luck next time Joe, oh wait forget it, I wont go back. I went to Milestones instead where I was given great service and able to watch relevant things on their tv's at the bar."}
{"text":"The runs immediately after consuming their eggs (sunny side up) from the $4 slam.  The wait was also ridiculously long at 4am, then 10am. Stay away for your own good."}
{"text":"The worst Denny's ever.  We were sat at a table and was not greeted for 10 minutes so we left.  No one cared.  We watched as there were no servers tending to any tables.  I think it is a managerial issue.  They seat people to quickly for the servers to handle and thats just restaurant 101.  Sad thing is I have always given this Denny's second chances... I keep coming here even though I know I will get poor service.  Not to mention the nasty sticky menu's I was forced to touch to look at the menu. Today was the final straw, no more Simmons Denny's any more."}
{"text":"Any town USA. Friendly, fast, and food uniform to locations. Half the patrons are buzzed no matter the time of day but all good and just looking for a reasonably priced meal in Vegas. Right on the strip outside harrahs so easily accessible and open 24."}
{"text":"Never again! Wife &kids were undecided on where to go to eat. I suggested Denny's so maybe everyone can get something different. Upon walking in the manager asks my wife how many, 5 she says. Even though the diner empty of customers, we waited 10 min to be seated. After being seated, we were told our waitress would be with us shortly. Our waitress was cleaning other tables and restocking the silverware. Till she finally comes to the table and gathers our order of drinks. My kids & myself included politely ordered our drinks, she walks off to get them I assumed. My son noticed that the grumpy old manager who told us to wait, welcomed a family with a warmest of welcomes. Grabbed menus & showed them to a table proceeded to converse with them. Noticing the time it was 6 min till our drinks arrived & the waitress took quickly our orders, only to come back to complete the order my son gave (no sides). We waited!!! We notice that the family that came in after us, were receiving their meals! My son mentioned that we must be of wrong color (nothing new for Denny's) as to why were still waiting. My wife asked waitress & got the story that the cook is temperamental (not my problem). Wife asks to speak to manager who brings out our plates doesn't speak to anyone no hi or any apology. Attempts to walk off when my wife asked why did we have to wait so long? His reply! Cuz of the hamburgers, they take longer to cook. So I asked , ok Mr lame a##excuse where's my son salad? You growing the lettuce? He fumbles off and has the waitress come with the salad which at that point she's making every excuse possible. Offering nothing else till we are done eating (refills) the mgr walks by and says \"when you come to pay I'll take care of you\". As I'm being rung out he tells me he took 10% off the meal. Now I don't want the whole thing for free, but he could've done better than that! Even during her rant the waitress mentioned that service has declined to its lowest point with the new management staff. Funny I came home told my family members, went to work and told my coworkers and work with the public and told them how they should avoid Denny's for they are going back to their old ways, must be of certain nationality to be seated and served other wise you & your family are not welcomed there. In order to post I had to select 1 star otherwise this resygets none!"}
{"text":"*Don't go to this location, you'll only get rip off- straight in your face!  Rueben is definately correct- they pocket the cash money. unbelievable America.   Here are the details:  So my husband, son, and I came in at 9pm on a Wednesday. We were the ONLY customers in the entire restaurant. I wasn't hungry and Jr. just ate.  We ordered : the sampler, an onion mushroom chop steak entree, an oreo shake, and a kids sundae.   The waitress seemed nice enough.....making small talk.. complimenting about how cute my son was and how she had 5 kids(!) ...blah blah blah...  She said when we were ready she had our bill ready.  We left a tip and went to pay. !!! she said \"your total is 36.57\". !! !! i was super shocked !! ! I paid her in 5's and 1's...and handed her the 37 bucks in loose cash.  ! she didn't even bother to re-count it and stuff it in the register without separating the cash.! ! I then said \"can i have the reciept\" (!) and she started stuttering and stalled and talked BS.  and i said \" it just seems like a lot when for the one entree we ordered.\" the BS waitress's excuses \"yeah it does\", \"the screen is cooperating\", \"i have to re-ring it\".. Whatever byotch just do whatever and gimme my reciept.  So she finally prints it out and even points out our items.. and at the dam bottom it says $26.57!! I confronted her and pointed out the total and  she automatically open the register and give me back my 10 when I started to  say \" It's 26 and I gave you 36\"..she said 'oh, i owe you ten back\". (b4 even double-chking or counting anything)..man it was soooo scheme-ful!!   To finally conclude my detailed yelp: the biyotch tried to stuff my 10 dollars in her own pocket. She knew what she was doing, what she said, and has obviously done this to many other customers.  But she got caught. red handed.   THATS SOOOO FREEAKKKEN SHADY SCHEMING WAITRESS!  Descrption of shady waitress: caucasion female, avg built, black straight long hair with a few purple streaks, black eyes, with 5 kids(!) (she looked a lil young to have a 19, 18, 17, 7, and 5 year olds)  BTW-the food sucked."}
{"text":"Don't know if our waitress was new or something but service was slow and not friendly. I'm assuming it was too busy for her, but we sat for 15 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. We saw other waiters, standing around talking and when Our waitress finally got our drinks and we told her we're ready to order and she said  she'll get our drinks first. 10 minutes went by and finally our drinks come, needless to say we didn't want to leave because we've invested so much time already. By the time our food came a party which we were seated before was done eating. The food was like any other Denny's. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, or I'd advise this location to hire more employees or assist the waiters for help. First impression make a huge deal."}
{"text":"Meal was fine. Service was vacant. Felt like waitress was \"doing the needful\" Next time please visit the  table more than to required."}
{"text":"No good deed goes unpunished. First good review, then,  now, a late night visit to the 51st Ave and Indian School Road location. I've had enough breakfast sandwiches to last me a lifetime, so a couple eggs on a plate in a real restaurant sounded good.   Grand Slam: eggs, sausage, hashed Browns, toast-I just felt like it.    I should've known the instant I saw the sausages but I was so hungry I just started eating. A sausage that's been cooked on a grill has been seared; there's no way it can wrinkle. But a sausage that's wrinkled, or crepe-looking, has been cooked in the deep fryer. It's an old restaurant shortcut, and it's not against the law but their grease was old, it fouled the sausage and it left me feeling less than well.  Maybe it's my delicate demeanor...or tummy.   I called the restaurant the next day, I was told they never fry the sausages and in my opinion, that is a lie.   I called Dennys Customer Service on a 1-800 number and 7 days later no one had called me. I called Denny's back and asked that management should call me. When I got the call it was is fruitless and full of denial as was the call to the local restaurant.  I can assure you that I'll be eating at Petsmart before I go back to Dennys.  Any Denny's.   And by the way, another coat of paint at this location just isn't going to make it any better. It's old, it looks run down, like a slum Denny's, and so was the food. Hey Dennys: CHANGE THE GREASE!"}
{"text":"Don't get the shakes they are far too overpriced for the portion and the taste is what you can get anywhere else....the food portion was good and tasted good....but all in all not worth going again ...it's definitely not what I remember from years ago"}
{"text":"We stood by the door and waited to be noticed. It took a minute, but when the guy who was cleaning tables and the floors turned and saw us he immediately put everything aside and seated us. He was very polite, and the floors looked great!  My husband loves the burgers at Denny's. This might not be your first choice for something like that, but they are actually really good. Well, usually they are really good. We ordered their new jalape√±o burger, and I got chicken tenders. I just love chicken tenders, especially with honey mustard. YUM!   Our food was burnt. All of it. The burger was so dry, and well done. The bacon was blackened. My chicken tenders were a few shades darker than I have ever seen them. We started to eat as we were so hungry, but then quickly realized the state of our food. Our waitress quickly got the manager, and she apologized saying that they had a new cook. At first his food was coming out raw, so he was overcompensating and cooking things too long. Ugh.  We were so disappointed, and left. I am not sure how long it will be before their cook learns the proper techniques so that we can return."}
{"text":"Graveyard shift is the worst shift that I ever come to orders never right  it always takes 30 minutes for someone to even greet me"}
{"text":"We went around 10pm. Very clean Denny's. I like the style in the restaurant. Great wait staff! And of course, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Forgot toast took 5 mins to find someone to get it and never got any refills on water until we were leaving. Slow checkout at register as well"}
{"text":"What can I tell you?  I'm a big Denny's fan.  I've done my gourmet brunch places and  breakfast chain restaurant thing and I think Denny's will always have a soft spot in my heart.  No, this is not your aunties and uncles, petite dejeuner, swan...etc, people.  Nor is this your Cora's or Sunset grill chains, either.  It's your simple, down-to-earth breakfast for families at a reasonable price kinda place.  Hooray to that!  I like the fact that their no non-sense breakfast menu is so extensive that you feel like a kid in a candy store.  When you go out for breakfast/brunch with kids, I find that variety and price is key to satisfaction and Denny's definitely knows how to deliver in both departments.    I've tried their Calgary & Whitby locations as well as this one in Mississauga, and as it should be at well-run chain restaurants, quality of food/presentation/price/service is completely within expectation.  I hate how places like Cora's, Eggsmart, Eggspectation...etc try to pass themselves off as higher end than what they really are by having fancy fruit decorations and charging $13+ for a plate of breakfast combos.  No, Denny's will serve you the same quality of food, larger portions for much less.    We were a group of 4 adults and 2 kids (4 & 7).  We ordered coffee/juice/milk, the adults had 2, lumberjack breakfasts, Moons-over-my-hammy breakfast sandwich combo, blueberry pancake meal and 2, children's pancake meal ($3.29 includes 3 generous kids size pancakes with a sausage and a strip of bacon).  With a very generous tip to our hard-working server, the bill came to $90 which is ridiculously reasonable by any Sunday brunch standards.  We left the restaurant with full bellies and a happy wallet.  What more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"My last Denny's review was for a different location although this is the location we frequent the most.  For a hassle free birthday brunch with a baby, we chose to dine at Denny's.  As always, the bustling dining room was filled with activity as busy servers deftly took orders, fill them and refill countless cups of coffee for patrons.  Denny's is a kind of place where you know exactly what you're going to get.  This consistency is what I love about Denny's.  Everything from food to service, I have not been disappointed at Denny's.  Sure, it's no quaint downtown brunch spots but good luck trying to wait in line for 45 min and try to squeeze in a stroller in what's usually way too small a dining room anyways.  So, here we are.  Hassle-free and an excellent example of quality control.  Denny's.    We each ordered OJ and coffee to start.  Neither the OJ or the coffee are excellent but they will do.  I ordered a prime rib skillet and the hubby ordered country fried steak skillet.  Both were very hefty brunch items indeed.  Both skillets came sizzling with potatoes, veggies and meat nicely charring away....all topped with mounds of cheese.  Gosh....you've got to love it here.  Oh yeah, and there is also a side of toast that comes with each entrees.  Our little girl even partook in some buttered toast.  :)    I don't think I need to go into detailed description of the merits of the skillet since this is not that kind of review.  Sure, my prime rib skillet was brimming with huge chunks of extra tender beef.  How can you possibly go wrong when you throw together skillet potatoes, sizzling veggies, juicy beef pieces and cheese?  You can't.  Believe me.    All in all, this was another satisfying Denny's experience for me and my little girl's very first visit to Denny's.  I have a feeling we'll be coming back here for years to come for many more pre and post movie meals or just for a good old family style breakfast.    Oh yeah, there is also a promo where you can get a free Denny's grand slam breakfast on your birthday.  Maybe one day.  :)"}
{"text":"The food and service was fine but the smell was horrible. The entire time I was eating it smelled like a rest stop bathroom."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review on the fact that it's a Denny's. The service was excellent and the food was brought out quickly. My steak and eggs was cooked perfectly. The pancakes were fluffy and very tasty. The hash browns were crispy on the outside, and most and flavorful on the inside. Great meal for a Denny's."}
{"text":"WOW... Generally I love dennys. And I realize that on christmas it is crazy being the only place open. BUT COME ON! It took 45 min. for my to go order to come up and when I got it, it was ice cold! WHY WAS I KEPT WAITING LONG ENOUGH FOR IT TO COOL? When I got home I realized that there was no syrup for the 3 orders of pancakes nor was there the side of bacon I ordered. and to top it off I handed the lady a 20% off coupon and it was never put on, NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"These folks work hard!!! There is so much chaos and craziness but somehow this staff figure it out.  We sat at the counter so we witnessed first had how much pressure they are under. Maida  our was great and  made balancing eggs and coffee and wiping counters like second nature.  Prices are also great for being in the middle of the action. We were staying at the mirage and prices for eggs and bacon were about  $20 bucks vs $4! At Denny's.  Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a simple traditional American breakfast for a reasonable price in the middle of all the action. (Across the street from The Mirage )"}
{"text":"We stopped at this Denny's location before a Pirates game because we had free Grand Slam coupons from a previous game we went to.  It's a small place and was extremely hectic on a Sunday morning/early afternoon. We waited about five minutes for a table. When our waitress came to our table, she saw we had the coupons and just asked us how we wanted our eggs. It was a 15 second interaction. I get they were busy, but she could have been a little more personal.   Food was good! Pancakes, bacon, sausage and eggs all for around $7 I believe if we would have paid full price. Great deal with the size of your breakfast.   I would visit again for their breakfast, but not this location. It seems it needs some renovations to match all of the newer places on McKnight Road."}
{"text":"Great location, really nice on the inside, great service. Zesty nachos and club sandwich are to die for."}
{"text":"It's been years since I had been in this store.  They have remodeled and it looks nice. The menu has some pretty good late night options.  Let me tell you, David was our server and he was awesome!  Great energy and knew his stuff and the perfect balance of attention. A pleasant surprise.   The food was decent. We just had appetizers.  I really like their shredded tater tots!  My husband wants to come back to try their chorizo burger."}
{"text":"Zero stars is not an option. I cannot understand why it is so difficult to serve a good hot breakfast from a company that has been doing it for years.  The food was cold and nasty."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Denny's with my family for years. This Denny's was new and local so we decided to give it a try. This was one of the WORST dining experiences of my life. I understand they're new so I guess there are A LOT of kinks to work out. The service was terrible first of all. There were six of us at the table and after we ordered the server only brought food for half of us. It wasn't for another thirty minutes the rest of the table got their food. This was inexcusable. By time I got my food half of the table had finished eating. The server had forgotten about half a table. It would be different if the red headed side bunned girl was busy but we were her only table in a nearly empty restaurant. A reason for this is poor training and terrible management. The manger should maybe bring some of the sign flippers inside maybe he should focus on the few customers he has before trying to get new ones."}
{"text":"Chicken was hard and there was hardly any avacado in my cali club. My salad also had wilted lettuce. Just bad food all around. Waitress took forever to check on us too although she was nice when she did. I don't know if it's because it's Vegas or what but if you just want cheap food sure come here but if you want a good experience don't."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Cold coffee, super bird that looks like it was ran over by a semitruck, slow inattentive staff. Smug manager. Never again!! And sticky dirty high chair that my guest had to wipe down herself! Close this place down!"}
{"text":"Came to Denny's to have a good breakfast asked for water and lemon, two of three glasses were dirty. Spoke with the manager and her response was,'Oh there was a smoothie attack!' Thinking she would offer some kind of discount, nope still paid the full bill and what great customer service. NOT"}
{"text":"Me and family went to Denny's for some comfort food but we did not get close to comfort. Matter of  fact we did not even get food what so ever. The lady named Eva with the mole on her face that was in charge gave us so much attitude and she was racist towards us and started yelling at us for not being patient when she keeps insisting that we have only been there for 30min when we have been there for 2 hours with no food.   We were okay and patient but overtime we ask if the food was done they would say I don't know just wait and find out.  She made my cousin who just graduated cry due to her asking for the bill just to pay for the soda.  Overall the experience here was very horrible indeed and the staffs here make you feel insecure about your self. At times I felt as if she was going to stand up and slaps us across the face just because we wanted our food.  We placed our food before the other tables but due to the staff having friends there who is the customer they just brought their food out first when we ordered first.   If you want a restaurant who hires unprofessional, uncivilized, and down right rude employees then this place is for you.   I personally would rate this place a 0 but there isn't a zero star option sadly."}
{"text":"Place was clean, food was ok, service was great. It was hard deciding between and 3 and a 4 star but I gave them the nod for the 4th star due to service. Music was cool too, I felt like I was at a diner in the 90's just relaxing. Not like the one in Pulp Fiction where that annoying ass couple robbed and the woman kept yelling. Like calm down lady it's just a robbery!"}
{"text":"Damn this was downhill. I'd been a faithful to the Denny's when it used to be on Queen St down the corner for a decade. This just no. The ambiance is nice an cozy, young staff. Some are being trained. Nothing took too long, waiter came around to ask, friendly. So no issues here. I will admit considering there were maybe 4 tables incl ours being used the restaurant wasn't clean. I could see visible dirt on the ground.   The food though was another story. I've attached two comparisons of the image in the menu vs what was served as well. I know you can't make it as nice as the menu's of course, but at least try a little.   I had the \"Spicy\" Skillet with Chicken. There wasn't even the \"S\" from spicy in there. It was bland. Needed a ton of hot sauce. Decent potatoes grilled, slammed with cheese. The chicken had no sauce on them, no flavour, just sliced up an thrown on top (considerably less than what was shown in the image). Mushrooms in both dishes were sliced so thin they would be impossible to saut√© properly.   The alaskan salmon skillet was sub par. On a bed of broccoli and more potatoes. Just didn't feel fresh. Took a bite an left it as is. This was the issue. I complained to the waiter that it was terrible and to please let the manager know. I don't think he understood (appeared as if in training) brought us the bill as is without any changes. When I requested the salmon be taken off the bill, he sought the manager who came though an asked what the issue was, then said she would take 50% off the price of the skillet. That's terrible. In a dining establishment, if less than 30% of the meal was eaten it's not charged at all. To top it off for a $14.59 skillet, 50% is $7.30, the \"refund\" was $7. The amount does not matter, it's negligible, it's the integrity. Not a Denny's I would care to visit again. This was disappointing."}
{"text":"Worst of all the Denny\"s franchises. My boyfriend and I came in for breakfast and the place only had 3  tables occupied, but the \"host\" decided to sit us next to the kitchen. 10 past and no one greeted us and we noticed other new arriving guest being seated on the other side out of the sight of the kitchen. After a few moments we decided to leave and go to IHOP. The waitress came around with the host with a smile and said \"Oh, can I help you get the door\"?   WTF?! If I could give this rate a zero I would. The location is perfect, the management sucks. Someone needs to take over this place from the current owner."}
{"text":"Came here to eat with my family, my server was a Latina lady named Danielle. When my food was brought the food runner forgot to give butter and syrup for my pancakes. By time I got that, I realized my eggs were cooked wrong. With being on a time limit I didn't have time to wait for them to cook new eggs and I was sure my other food would of been cold by time they were done. So I canceled just my order. They also messed up another order at my table. The customer service here was terrible in general. My server had the nerve to make it noticeable that she had an attitude about it."}
{"text":"Ummmm wow where do I start!!  I mean it is Vegas!!  The food was a typical Denny's food. And the service was ok I mean if you like a waitress with jailbird looking tattoos up and down her arms. The people watching by the window was by far better then the food/service. You have a wonderful mix of crack heads, homeless people and well just lost souls wandering around!!  Hey wouldn't visit here again I would go further down my the Paris Hotel and Casino."}
{"text":"This review will only be reflective of the quality of the food.   I visited this place again on a Wednesday night, it was busy; but not that busy where I had to wait.   It took awhile for the waitress to come but it was given since she had a person in training with her, she was apologetic and that was that.   I ordered the Burbon Skillet with a Mango Lemonade; although I felt the drink would be better solo, it was nice.   The main dish was absolutely phenomenal! I was very surprised with the flavour it had and would definitely have it again. It came with two chicken breasts and was paired with potatoes and broccoli. Although it was slightly expensive; the taste is worth it."}
{"text":"Loved the service and the bourbon skillet chicken. Everything came out hot and fast. My server Nicole was great. I never get good service when I go out but she was great !"}
{"text":"It's Denny's. I hardly come here except for group gatherings and yesterday was one of those. We had our own reserved area and menus were available at each table and booth. Our server Eric was great, very attentive and friendly. I ordered the grand slam which ends up being a good deal; choose 4 items for under $8. The buttermilk pancakes stood out, so fluffy and delicious; my eggs, hash browns and toast were standard. Service was quick and we paid at the register, making it easy to pay and leave when we were ready."}
{"text":"Great old school service from the waitresses here, they were cracking me up and i needed it after being in a dumb ass fancy club all night.  Typical Denny's other than that, cheap basic american eats and another good place to avoid outrageous Vegas food prices."}
{"text":"Went to the Denny's on Mayo last night. There was only one other couple in the restaurant at that time.  After they sat us it took at least 5 minutes to be waited on. After just ordering just a water and coffee, that took another 5 or more minutes to bring us that.  There was no reason all that took so long.  The people who worked there were all just sitting in a booth eating and being very loud. They were yelling to the cooks in the back.  Now 2 other customers came in.  The place was extremely cold.  The customers asked to be moved because of the chill.  We finally got our food, which was only satisfactory.  Only when the less confident waitress (Katie) gave us our bill did we get a refill on the coffee.  She was too busy with the other employees in the booth being loud and obnoxious.  The back door was prompted, which bugs and mosquitos were coming in. The middle round circle surrounding the tables was very dusting.  Looks like we will find a new place to go from now on."}
{"text":"Linda Henderson is a ROCKSTAR! !!!!   She seems to be the only real worker they've got. As an Executive in a near by Hotel. I may just steal her for my team! !!  She has great customer service and speedy service.  She was a gem."}
{"text":"Waitress's service was not good. Dishers left some green stuff at the bottom (inside) of my cup, and I noticed this towards my last sips. Also, the waitress did not bring my friend's change- it was not much, but who does that. We waited a while and then decided to leave. On the other side, the food was satisfying. 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing customer service and great food!!! I went to another establishment just before arriving here and let me tell you this place has got the goods HANDS DOWN!!! The wait staff was great.... The food came out promptly and delicious!!! When I return to Vegas again this yr I will definately return to this place!"}
{"text":"DANGEROUS Cook!! Ok have come here a couple times and tonight was the worst ever. No pride in there food at all. First off my husband ordered the \"Avocado\" burger! We got our plates he opened his burger and there were two itty bitty postage stamp size little chunks of Avocado on there so we asked the waitress for more. She was kind enough to bring us more but the thing is it was all black. Like WTH? So the poor waitress came back around I handed her the avocado and said you can take this back to the cook and ask him if he knows what a good fresh avocado is!!! The waitress who i really felt bad for went back in the kitchen and cut my husband a fresh avocado sliced properly like in the picture. Then after that the cook actually started giving me dirty looks walking in and out of the kitchen multiple times doing so. I will find out who the owner is I will be reporting you. I can't believe this guy works here. Stay far far away. I sure hope the nice waitress finds a better place to work. I did tip her well for stepping up and doing the right thing."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of breakfast type foods but I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to Denny's. Very friendly service. Food arrived pretty quickly and most importantly the food tasted pretty good. Tried the cinnamon pancake which came with 2 eggs, bacon and hash brown. The pancakes were huge and could have been a meal on its own and it was drizzled with icing to give it that cinnabon type of taste. Also got the country fried steak and egg which also came with 2 eggs and a skillet filled with potato wedges, peppers, onions. The combination of all this made it very appetizing. Everything came to about $23 after tax. Not bad when it feeds 2 people."}
{"text":"Great breakfast specials, under 8 bucks and you get coffee and juice.  Totally remodeled restaurant since I was in last. Looks great. Service was fast and friendly. Looking good Denny's, always great coffee to."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge - 2018  #72  I'm not a big fan of Denny's but my friends insisted on eating her.   I ordered a tall glass of water and let them enjoy their food. The food did not look good to me but they loved it. My husband ordered a pancake breakfast with hash browns and sausage.Two other friends ordered burgers and they all enjoyed their meal.   Our server JB was really nice and on a busy Saturday night he was sure to stop by any chance he got. The other staff is pretty nice as well. Checking out is pretty easy. You literally walk up to the counter and pay and then you're done.  4/5 stars because the restrooms were disgusting. There was paper everywhere, the trash was over flowing and no paper towels. The restaurant was clean but their restroom need some work."}
{"text":"Had the absoultely worst experience at dennys I've ever had today. Not only was the food terrible and over cooked but the cashie/manager MIGUEL Was absolutely rude to me when I was trying to figure how much of a tip to leave. He was so impatient, aggressive, loud and downright disrespectful. I couldn't believe how impolite he was being towards me and my friend. I WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER again come to this Dennys location ever again."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst service in Denny's history. Every time we come here, I hope the old lady isn't working. But of course, she probably lives here. Yes she's sweet and kind, but she's is so slow, forgets items, forgets your order, or in tonight's adventure - charge your card the wrong amount and wait FOREVER to get it voided. She is the absolute worst and the reason I won't come back!"}
{"text":"If I could go lower on stars I would. Me and my boyfriend went on Christmas night. It was a normal crowd of people. Our food ( a simple toast, eggs, and pancakes) took over an hour to get to us. People who had come in after us were leaving before us. And the food we received wasn't even ours, but we were starving so we ate it anyways. Later on we ended up getting food poisoning from it. I am highly disappointed and I don't recommend."}
{"text":"I'm rating this based on it being.. well.. a Denny's. I feel like for any chain, you already know what to expect, so you just rate them based on the variance of each location. No one is going to see a five star Denny's rating and assume it's in line with Robuchon.  This location suits me just fine for a cup of severely mediocre coffee before school. I get my own booth to spread my books out for a last minute study cram and the waitresses are always efficient and smiling, especially Kelly! The older lady who works up front is incredibly friendly- pinching babies cheeks kind of friendly. She has that old school diner feel.  All of the food ranges from mediocre to fairly gross. I'm pretty sure they don't have any unprocessed cheese in the house. The toast is like.. cardboard. I don't even know. They do have some healthier options clearly marked on the menu and that's what I always go for, even though they're all variations of egg whites, spinach and cherry tomatoes with fresh fruit.  I like to pretend I'm eating healthy when I come here, and maybe elsewhere I actually would be had I ordered the same thing - but here, the spinach always comes saturated in grease. It usually comes barely wilted, and while that's just how I like it.. it makes the grease even more uncalled for.  I wouldn't recommend a Denny's probably ever, but for my last minute school needs, it fits the bill well. The service makes up for the food."}
{"text":"Nothing like working all day, partying all night then going to Denny's at 5 AM to get something in your stomach before you have to go to work in a couple hours.. Yay Denny's!!  I remember the plate.. can't recall what was on it.. but it was able to soak up some of the alcohol in my system and allowed me to keep on going..."}
{"text":"This was my second time ever at a Denny's, and my second time around wasn't that good.   I didn't like the eggs, they were too mushy and the pancakes weren't so tasty how I remembered them to be. The sausages weren't so bad, sausages are always good though. What did like was their oreo milkshake, it was like a cookies n' cream heaven. I find that their food always looks so good on the billboards and commercials, am I the only one?   I wouldn't necessarily make an effort to come back to this Denny's but I can't lie I would go back to the first location I was at."}
{"text":"There was about a 5 minute wait and could not believe how busy this location is on the strip. However, the staff should get a huge pat on the back because everyone was so quick and pleasant from the hostess getting the names to being seated asap, and then our server who was juggling so many tables was able to provide exceptional service. Armondo you are the bomb and great at your job! Thank you for a pleasant dining experience despite the huge crowds."}
{"text":"Excellent Service!! Even though busy on a Saturday morning, Nichole was excellent, kind, and very attentive! Wish I lived closer, I would be a regular. Food was great even with modifications!"}
{"text":"Wow now I know they have only been open 2 weeks, but was not impressed. We walked in and asked for a booth. No smiles to be found. We finally got seated and our waitress took our order. They were 4 of us. The wait was long and when it finally came out we each had something missing to our order. My eggs were warm, my friend's were cold.  We had to ask 3 seperate times for the rest of our orders. Our waitress was clueless to what we ordered. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went to the location just north of the Strat, which I think is this one.  We were meeting up with others in our group and wanted a quick bite to eat.  It's a Denny's, so cheap, decent but not great food, and reasonably fast service.  They accommodated our large party quickly and got the job done.  I ordered the all-american slam and found the meat and eggs OK, and the hashbrowns fine when hot but inedible otherwise.  The worst part was the english muffin dripping with butter that had a chalky weird taste.  Not where I plan to spend most of my time in Vegas, but A-OK it is."}
{"text":"I am judging this against other Denny's. This is in an industrial area. So there's like truck drivers everywhere. I don't mind that. Who do you think delivers everything you want? The food tasted like every other Denny's. And cost the same. So eat your eggs and enjoy them, if you want upscale go to Matt's."}
{"text":"I am rating this as a Denny's. Not against St. Francis, right across the street. Let's just be clear. It's Denny's/ Make your own breakfast is always a good thing. Choose several off a large list of bacons and fruits, etc. Service was adequate, place is loud, fairly clean, very busy. Food is Denny's. Bill is pretty fair when you get it. I will let you know I was dragged here by an older friend. There are better choices nearby. It's the Ruby Tuesday's of diners....lots of seniors and children."}
{"text":"It is Denny's. You either understand the wonder that is Denny's or you're a snob and won't let yourself love it.  Other than this location being new and still working out the kinks of having a largely inexperienced staff, there are no complaints.  I've been there nearly a dozen times since it opened a month ago. Never had the same meal twice, never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I love coming to this Dennys and it's become my sunday morning rituals. Typically, you are seated very fast even though it is busy and the service is also prompt and friendly. Overall there's nothing bad to say or anything extraordinary to report. Occasionally you would get the not-up-to-par food or the slow service, but honestly from coming here so frequently I know there are off days. Generally, this location is a thumbs up with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Love there service great people and there food is very good you can't beat the price and you can never go wrong at a Denny's every time I come to Vegas always come to Denny's"}
{"text":"Came in here for a bit of a late night dinner, about 8:30pm, after we tried to go to an Outback Steakhouse that turned out to be closed down!  The service was swift and friendly and our food was very satisfying.  I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Denny's is always a great choice for a consistent menu experience.  I'm not sure why this one has so few stars.  We ate at this location twice during our weekend stay in Las Vegas.  It's walking distance to the Encore hotel.  We were there about 8am both Saturday and Sunday mornings.  Our service was satisfactory and our breakfast was great, as we've come to expect from Denny's.  This restaurant is next to a Walgreens and there's plenty of parking in the back lot if you're driving."}
{"text":"The service was OK, my party was seated quickly but the food was horrible. The Cookie could not get my eggs right. Even after I sent them back 3 times, the manager even wanted me to eat them because he made them, NOT! Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Runny eggs and when I sent them back they were still runny eggs. The t-bone steak was 70% fat and I showed the waitress and she didn't care at all. It was the worst cut of meat I've ever had. If you HAVE to eat there get the ham steak you will always get a good cut that way. The coffee was cold and I had to asked for more then one creamer and she brought back a cup with on creamer in it. This screams of management cutting back on everything or the wait staff just hate the customers. Perhaps its a little of both I don't know.   Never again will I go into a Dennys."}
{"text":"The worst Denny's I have ever eaten at.  For customer service.  Waited for ever to get a menu.  No utensils.  Food took long to get.  Food was cold and French toast was burned.  This place suck!!!  Don't waste ur time or money here."}
{"text":"Extremely long wait for no reason, we walked in at 9pm on Tuesday night, waited 20 mins for our table, even though there were plenty of empty tables inside. When we finally sat down, we waited another 15 mins, no server came, no one even came to bring us water. After almost half an hr of waiting, the busser felt sorry for us and brought us water and ordered food for us. If you can, please walk away for this place"}
{"text":"This Denny's has been updated since the last time I have been there. So the feeling is \"like new\". The food is ok. Not my favorite place to go but it is affordable and it's open everyday all day. The service was good and prompt. We came for lunch and had the pick two combo for $6.99. That includes your choice of soup or salad, side of fries and a choice of 6 sandwiches.   They always have something new here so it's cool to see what's new this time around. I was surprised to see there was hardly any people here. But probably due to the time. If it's late and nothing else is open, go here."}
{"text":"I get it was Christmas but....they ran out of beef so no burgers. 2 cooks only. No one said hi when we walked in. Left after 5 mins since Eric pretty much said we weren't going to be served. I got the hint...."}
{"text":"I came in late at night and my server, who I believe was named Sean, made me a milkshake. Well I saw him making it and there were 3 cups instead of the usual 2 getting the milkshake poured in. When I got my milkshake, the tin that comes with extra was maybe half the usual amount. Then I saw Sean walking around with the third cup of milkshake. So, in conclusion, I am giving one star because this nigga drink my goddamn milkshake."}
{"text":"It always pains me to give few stars, but it's always deserved as well. There are several things that I disliked about this establishment and only 1 thing I liked. Let's get the kindness out of the way 1st, the service and server were excellent. Very friendly and management really does want every quest to have a great experience.  Moving on the what they clearly can do better: my food was severed warm an not hot. It arrived rather quickly so why was it warm already. The meat was flabby, like my arms, so I know flab when I see it. The hash browns were very crisp, read this as burnt, underneath the top layer. The toast was about the only thing I ate. They are a very busy establishment, extremely so, I think an extra few minutes wait while they pay attention to detail would be a wonderful addition. The buser arrived at the table without saying a word to remove plates offering  a clear line of vision of the dirty dish receptacle.  The management saw that I was not eating and offered several times to make it right. I gracefully declined, but they were insistent. They brought me a fresh fruit bowl in replacement for the inedible items on my plate."}
{"text":"I split an awesome hot fudge sundae here with my wife. The service was great and it was only 4 bucks. The waiter with the positive energy tattoo made our night. Thanks for making it a great experience!"}
{"text":"Red was our server and she is a ROCK STAR!!! Sunday of course is busier than most days, so took I little bit to get our food, but WELL WORTH the WAIT!! Food was hot and delicious!! The Grand Slamich is a breakfast sandwich with Ham, crumbled bacon and Sausage. Adding onions to it and my hash browns just set the meal off! Mom gave me her soft well cooked pancakes with the warm delicious maple syrup, YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"I love Denny's and I'm not afraid to admit it.  All you yuppies will just have to deal with it.  Obviously the breakfast food is good (and served 24 hours), but the other stuff is good too.  The great thing about Denny's is the consistency.  Every Denny's is the same.  It's always a safe bet if you're traveling and are timid to try someplace new.  Pancakes are one of my favorite foods.  I want just butter and maple syrup, and that's just the way Denny's makes them.  I don't want heaps of sugar like whipped cream and chocolate, that trash just overpowers the taste of the actual pancake.  Denny's will have specials from time to time with things like pumpkin pancakes, but they are always able to stay true to the classic buttermilk.  The other thing I usually get at Denny's is the Moons Over My Hammy sandwich.  There's two different types of cheese, eggs, and ham.  The best part is the super buttered up toast though.  Honestly, you can't go wrong with Denny's.  Its affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a bite to eat after going out one night. We seated ourselves at a booth, and a group of people that were waiting for their bill told us to not sit in the section because it was bad service. We made the wrong decision and ignored the group and sat down. After waiting about 5 minutes,  our waitress came to the table to get our drink order. After another 5 minutes, our drinks finally arrived and she took our order. 10 minutes went by, and our waitress came back and told us she had lost our order and wanted to know what we wanted again! She never apologized, and acted like it wasn't a big deal. Our food finally arrived after an other 10 minutes. Our waitress never came back to check up on us, and never re-filled our drinks. I had to stop another waiter to get us water. Once it was time to get our bill, we went to the cashier area and asked a different waitress if we could have our bill because our waitress went missing. We wanted to split the bill on two cards, and she said she couldn't do that."}
{"text":"I brought my mom and my 93-year-old grandmother out to Denny's for Thanksgiving.  We decided it would be the best idea for my grandma, as she is in a wheelchair.  We were seated immediately at a nice clean table, and we each ordered a turkey dinner, fittingly.   I would have given this place 4 stars, as our waitress was super friendly and personable, but a couple things were a little off, especially on a holiday.  Our server didn't seem to know what type of side dishes or desserts were available that day; I sort of raised an eyebrow to this because, well, isn't that her job to know?  Second, she seemed too flustered to do anything efficiently, but she eventually got us our requested extra gravy and butter.  The food was excellent, I was rather impressed with how good their turkey and stuffing were, as well as the bread and potatoes.  The green beans were a little.... hard to chew, I guess.  They were tough, and that made it hard for my grandma to eat.  All in all, it was a good experience, and I'm glad I was able to spend it with my grandma.  I've been alive for 30 years, and this is the first Thanksgiving I've been able to spend with her.  I'm grateful we were able to go such a good restaurant and have a good time together.  Thanks Denny's!  Just remember, educate your employees about what food you have available!  :)"}
{"text":"Horrible 25 mins waiting for pancakes. Waiter never came to check on us worst experience in a Denny's should had went to ihop"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was to our table in no time. Breakfast is the best! The omelette is the best with all the vegetables. Nice place to eat if just passing through."}
{"text":"Wow, what a collection of freaking drunks you willl find here on any given morning. Kinda reminded me of Hollywood, grill back home.  This spot is right next to the Casino Royale. Food is good, hell anything is good when your hungover... but its a lifesaver because of its location!  Shake & bake seal of approval."}
{"text":"Overall this Denny's was fine. We were staying at the DoubleTree down the street and needed a late night bite to eat after dealing with a delayed flight and missed connection. Even though it was nearly midnight our server was attentive and nice. He seemed to be the only one working the dining area but it was a rainy Monday night, so they were not busy at all. He took our orders and brought out drinks quickly. Our food came out quickly as well. My waffle was fresh and crispy, and the eggs and bacon were decent. My man's Super Bird and fries were hot and fresh too. Of course it's not anything luxurious, because it's Denny's, but it was decent and satisfied us when we were hungry."}
{"text":"i like this location very clean, spacious, decorated with cute beach accents and not busy unlike other locations. definitely a nice place to get breakfast and enjoy the peacefulness. service is good and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is filthy. If only there was somewhere else to eat a decent breakfast in the area. The food is ok, but the servers are generally a train wreck in the morning, that and the often dirty tables, seats, and floors mean this place is almost too gross to eat at. And for God's sake, if you can avoid it never go into the men's restroom, a urinal should never have a moldy crust...ever."}
{"text":"I got a breakfast yesterday morning. The location is easy to find. service is fast and nice. Spent $20 for a huge breakfast. I like to give 5 stars if the food is good. the steak is over cooked and tasteless, hash brown is light cooked. i did not finished my meal.maybe i will back again for other meal."}
{"text":"Good american fast food, large menu for breakfast lunch or dinner. I took chicken skillet, was good but frozen... For dessert Apple crisp... so delicious I recommend it  :-)"}
{"text":"It was the first time at this place with my friend, I ever went in other location but not here and I think it's the last ! I took an apple crisp (ever took at an other Denny's) and I asked to my friend if it was a joke or not because the plate was almost empty ! Too small portion ! Just one slice of apple !!! The server wasn't smiling. I recommend to go in an other location..."}
{"text":"Decided to stop after shopping. We live in Monroeville but never seem to stop in.. Julian was a great server. We enjoyed him very much. He was friendly and attentive. The manager LeeAnn checked on us often also. Was a great visit. Will add Denny's back into our rotation. Thanks Julian for a great meal( even with flying bacon. Lol)"}
{"text":"This Denny's used to be one of my places of choice for late-night libations. Back in the day we'd stumble on over after a late night, laugh and talk (or shout, what with the busted eardrums from the loud music) to each other over the tables and order the cheap kind of food that was patently bad for you: nachos and wings and ice-cream and most importantly grand slam breakfasts. It was open all night, so we could stay and chat as long as we liked. It wasn't classy, it was Denny's and it was perfect. I'm just trying to put my review in perspective because I had expectations.  For old times sake, after a much quieter night, we headed down. It was decently late, so we caught the post-club crowd. In the light of sober, I see how obnoxious we used to be. Minus points for atmosphere. But I could have lived with that. It could've been alright. But they had made over the late-night menu so that it was both terrible and expensive.   The food was never particularly good, but the combination of cheap and greasy never fails. But they had cut down on the breakfast menu, and eliminated most of the apps. I asked to cut the fries from my burger and they took off a whopping .50 cents! The waitress did warn me, but it was a pretty bad burger and IT COST ME TEN DOLLARS. Ok, if I'm in a pub or a place with gourmet burgers, or like, not Denny's, I could be alright with it. But it WAS Denny's.   All of the food ordered placed firmly in the bad-mediocre range. The service was decent but a little slow, and the joint was obnoxious. We got our bills, shared a glance and agreed that we were never coming back. Goodbye my old friend, you've changed."}
{"text":"The food is standard Denny's food, you should know what to expect. This review is about their service, which was horrible. In fact I go there about once every three weeks and it is always HORRIBLE. Had to wait 10 mins to get seated when it was empty. Another 15 for my order to be taken. Then when the food is dropped off the waiter leaves the bill. He is missing the entire dining experience, not once did he stop by to see how things were. I had to ask three other servers to get my waiter to request a ranch, and that took him ten minutes.   Now I understand that restaurants sometimes get busy, but it was dead. The server was so rude and miserable. And Its not the first time he has waited on me, it's the third time. And every single time he looks miserable and is rude. Get some waitstaff that wants to actually work Denny's!"}
{"text":"Its Danny so we can expect much. My 7 year old daughter keeps seeing the commercial on Disney so she wanted to try it. When we left she said \"we dont need to go back there again! We tried it and it's not our cup of tea\" her pizza was cold and  no flavor. So she tried pancakes and said that they were okay"}
{"text":"The food is good (except the chocolate chip pancakes), the service is not the best. Food can vary in time from forever to quick even if there isn't much staff. The servers aren't well trained but the older staff is amazing. Been coming here since it was built. Staff is going down but the older staffing is still amazing."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was good, I just rated a 4 due to the chainyness"}
{"text":"on 11-20 last Sunday, me & a friend went to lunch at this location, she & I enjoyed our food & the waitress was nice. However, like I do EVERY time I go out to eat, I ordered a glass of water with lemon.  Even with the lemon in it, I could taste the chlorine, it tasted awful & I could not drink it.  As far as I am concerned when a restaurant can not have good tasting water thats filtered, I dont go back."}
{"text":"Only came in since breakfast was free. Dead and didn't even see my waiter for 20 minutes"}
{"text":"The waitresses are lousy. They do not even bring out their food. The food portions are inconsistent and often are not made correctly. The management is weak and provides no guidance for the servers or the cooks. Food can be good, depending who is cooking, but do not hold your breath. Many times the waitresses stand around instead of doing extra to make your dining experience exceptional. This Denny's needs the corporate office come in and clean house. The managers as a rule do not know how to run a tight ship."}
{"text":"Denny's will always hold a special place in my heart. Nothing fancy, but is always ready to serve you some traditional breakfast foods and diner fare. That being said, our experience this morning was lovely. Never did we run low on a beverage or go without a condiment that we needed. I had the fresh fit veggie skillet with no egg whites and sub in extra potatoes. They definitely missed out on the 'extra potatoes' part, but it was pleasant nonetheless! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Slow service. Don't trust their online ordering. They always have an excuse for not having your food in time even though you order for a specific time. Happened to me already three times! This last time the place was nearly empty so no excuse for their poor service."}
{"text":"The place needs a good cleaning,  everything in it is covered in greasy dinner prints.  I would touch the menu, greasy.  Someone needs to grrr bcc this crew how to clean.  Had a cheese burger,  obvious the cook ous not a cook,  it was picked at like he did know when it was done.  Tomatoes had the hard white core in them, lettuce was limp and whilted. Bun was dried out like it had been sitting there a while.  The waiter nice guy, the only reason this place stays in business is ther drop refers are a captive audience for 10 hours a day thanks to elogs. The cstore send like a safer bet and it's was a lot cleaner than the restaurant"}
{"text":"The menu they handed me when I walked in felt like it hadn't been cleaned since the place opened. had a horrid odor and I just walked out. if they can't clean their menus how can I expect them to clean the kitchen where they make my food."}
{"text":"I did not like this location very much and it wasn't the service or anything our waitress was nice, it was the food. I asked for my hash browns to be cooked on both sides to make it extra crispy. The waitress confirmed what I said for my order & the cook only cooked one side (like most places do). The pancakes came out almost burnt. Think of a dark cherry wood color for these pancakes. That's the reason why I think the cook wasn't paying any attention to the order since they obviously didn't pay attention to the pankcakes. Definitely would not come to this location again since the cook can't follow simple instructions."}
{"text":"Typical Denny's restaurant, not better or worse than others I've eaten at. It seems Canadian Denny's have similar menus as the Denny's in the USA.   I chose it eat there because it's across from the Best Western hotel I stayed at."}
{"text":"Danny's Has gone downhill for long time. Every so often I give it shot and I go there and regret Yuck I love breakfast and they have the worse bacon ever. Eggs are so so. I had sandwiches there before and they were ok. I rather spend more now and go to a better place where the food has better quality."}
{"text":"Like everyone else has said, it's a Denny's, so why bother reviewing it? I just had to say that this location is busy busy busy and, yet, the staff here move with lightning speed. We got seated, served and out the door in record time. And these people are dealing with drunks and those with major hangovers 24/7. If you want a quick breakfast, and you're down with Denny's, this is the spot. The $6 build-your-own grand slam will rival most breakfast buffets that cost 3x the price."}
{"text":"You have redeemed yourself Dennys!  This time around the wait was nominal, the food was delectable, and the customer service was pretty schweet!   Came her for a late breakfast and had about a 3 minute wait, we were greeted by the waitress a few minutes later, placed our order, and within 10 minutes had our yummy foods! I got the 2$ biscuit and grave (literally a biscuit cut in half with gravy over it, seemed from powder though!) and a 2$ short stack (2 buttermilk pancakes, really yummy) my son got the kids cheeseburger and wavy fries! Cooked perfect!  we were there less than an hour and our bill was a whopping 9$!!!  We will def be back!"}
{"text":"My son and I got seated and it took our server 15 mins to take our drink order... then another 10 for our food order. THEN 20 mins just to get our food. That day must've been busy because they were out of everything. I seen our server 1 time. She never came to check on us, nor did she actually bring me a ticket. I had to actually go up there to get the ticket.  The food was ok, nothing crazy delicious. If you want a cheap breakfast, but dont mind waiting 2 days for it this is def your place!"}
{"text":"We left.  No food.  We left. 10:30 on a Friday night.  Took 10 minutes to get seated.  Sat there 10 more minutes and no signs of life in our whole section of the restaurant.  There were 3 waiters and only about 5 tables with guests.  How darned hard is it to wait on a table??? Dennys needs to wake up & staff with enough people and ones who actually understand the term service."}
{"text":"Not the first time we walked in & were totally ignored.  Even after I went back & asked the hostess if we actually had a server for our table ... No one showed.   Its a busy truck stop Dennys & not the cleanest, not the brightest & a very mixed clientele.  certainly the service has repeatedly been very poor. Very probably the last time we will visit this particular Denny's.  We left & went to a Denny's a few miles down the road where we were waited on within minutes!"}
{"text":"What is wrong with this Company?  The place was empty but for a couple of tables with people.  They had probably 10 people waiting to be seated.  One waiter bussing a nearby table refused to help, another waitress looked at the crowd and scurried to the back.  One girl in front who was clearly trying to leave ( had her purse & jacket in-hand) took one persons name & just looked around....  We left.  We wanted food.  Not a dining experience and based on what we saw it was going to not be good....  it was going to be a very long painful experience.    Denny's-  wake up!! Staff & train properly!!  This is getting to be the common experience walking into almost any Dennys.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and was hot inside.. the AC wasnt working. Sweating waiting for our food. During the wait it  was difficult to get coffee fill up. Dirty forks and dish.. slow service. After waiting 30 minutes. .our food came out. One of our t bone steaks was medium well and the other was medium. .we both ordered mrare. Eggs were over cooked and dried out.. told the server we didnt want it and we left.. at least the management comped our drinks and small order of nachos... that was the only thing we had.. I wont come to this location again..choose another spot ..this location isnt where you would want to bring your family....disappointed. ...."}
{"text":"Was here 27 min to be seated now just fucken waiting its been 30 min for my fucken food.( new review ok its been an hour waiting on my food wtf"}
{"text":"After my visit this morning, I'm reminded how much big chains suck. I'm ok with serving me a subpar meal as long as the price reflects the quality, but 15 bucks for a terrible country fried steak and eggs and a coffee is heinous. I'll drive the extra 10 minutes to Blackfoot Truck Stop next time!"}
{"text":"Service was good until we actually sat down to eat. It took longer then expected. We had a host by the name on StaciLynn whom was energetic but very slow. My girlfriend and I seen a mass load of people coming in and having to wait also the wait to pay for the food was long."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my family and I come here alot. Never had an issue. Til today, the girl that is at the register to take your payment is so rude. Nasty human being. She complained in front of everyone about her co workers. She kept yelling at each person in line that she hopes they are paying in cash because to her it is faster than using debit or credit? As we were standing there she non stop complained about her three \"lazy\" managers because the line was too long for her to handle. I've never met a more unprofessional person in my life. She shouldn't be anywhere near customer service."}
{"text":"Elenor was our sever and she gave really bad service , we waited at our table to order take our for at least 20 mins and didnt check up on is at all . Everyone that i saw or talked to had a bad attitude"}
{"text":"Go here if you want your order to be wrong every single time. Horrible staff followed by even more horrible managers."}
{"text":"Worst service there is a few and by few I mean 2-3 servers that are awesome but the rest are awful. It took her 30 minutes from when we sat down to take our drink order and we still had to ask for her to bring our waters and a coffee because it was taking long. I asked for my daughters apply juice 3 times. I spoke to a manager and after that had to change my daughter in the restroom. She actually followed us in there to confront us about what I told the manager. And I went and told him again I didn't think that was appropriate for her to do that she started telling a coworker \"lets see what she is lying about now\"! There was no need or benefit of me complaining about the service besides the fact that it was horrible. I never asked for a discount and I didn't receive or get offered one. Never going back even though it is the closest one to home."}
{"text":"When I go to eat at a restaurant, the last thing I expect, NOR DESERVE, is to be YELLED AT. I have food allergies, and I was actually excited to see a meal I could order that I was able to eat. However, when I started to order, the waiter tried to help me out by saying an alternate dish may have been a better option, when in fact I would have received one less side dish for the same price...   The worst part (and my personal WORST EXPERIENCE EVER) was the fact that he started to get confusing with the side orders. There were clearly two included with the meal, and the meal description said you could get two additional sides. So... I told him I wanted fruit and then the desert. But then he tried explaining that wasn't the sides I could order... either way, he started to get VERY FRUSTRATED. He then proceeded to pick up the other \"main\" menu and SHOVE IT IN MY FACE, to show me the side dishes I could actually choose from. ****FIRST OF ALL, I DO NOT DESERVE the lack of respect that you showed me. Second, you need to control your own stress and frustrations to provide PROPER CUSTOMER SERVICE to your customers. I am a graduating senior from ASU, going into medical school, and am quite capable of ordering my food. YOU DO NOT NEED TO TALK DOWN TO ME, GET FRUSTRATED, RAISE YOUR VOICE, AND SHOVE A MENU IN MY FACE!!!*****   Honestly, the whole situation made me end up crying because I was so thrown off by this whole experience, and I did not need my MORNING ruined. If you can't handle busy mornings (at a breakfast joint) then you need to find yourself another job that involves less stress and NO exposure to customers. You were extremely rude, and completely ruined my experience at the restaurant. I will not be returning, and I will advise others not to.   We notified the manager. He spoke with the waiter, and said he would speak with him again later. *If* this store knew customer service, they would have DEFINITELY given me my meal free. Instead they made me charge full price. Um... excuse me?   Overall a horrible experience (the worst I've experienced... and that says a lot coming from a student who has a lot of allergies). My order was not even complicated AT ALL. And, what's even more hilarious is the fact that I ended up ordering EXACTLY WHAT I TOLD HIM THE FIRST TIME!!! Obviously he needs to get his s**** together, get his temper under control, and maybe cut back on the bacon to help your blood pressure get back to normal.   If you're looking to get some decent breakfast, you're better off going to iHop on Apache!!!!"}
{"text":"Not open 24 hours. I'm here right now, and they're telling me they're closed. No time to go to a different location because my girlfriend is flying out soon and wanted to go here on the last day to use a coupon"}
{"text":"Currently been sitting here for 30 minutes havent been able to order and have no water. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Scrambled eggs were hard, pancakes cold and had some onions on them from someone else's order I guess.  Yuck"}
{"text":"I am sure most of us have spent a drunken late night at Denny's, my go-to was Moon's Over My Hammy (how appropriate!)... Now that those drunken fueled college days are over and I am currently attempting this thing called adulting (it's way over-rated!) the only times you will find me at a Denny's these days are on two occasions, Road trips and Sunday mornings.  They do a solid breakfast - I'm a simple girl, I usually go with two scrambled eggs, bacon and a pancake. It's always super yummy!  This particular location is super clean and updated and service is always stellar. Now if only they served Bloody Mary's and mimosas!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for an early breakfast. I'm actually giving the waitress (ask for her) the 5 stars because it's rare going anywhere and someone going an extra mile and you can tell it's not for the money it's just who they are. The food was as one would expect from a joint like this. I got the steak Cobb salad. Can't complain not really any qualms there. No cheap lettuce and no old bruised junk which surprised me and it actually was not too bad. I'll say I was not looking forward to a Denny's and thought of getting out of it ...honestly I'd never go back save maybe for a quick bite and to show appreciation for the few waiters and waitresses that are pleasant by nature. So, service 5 stars (if she leaves maybe a 3 cuz it's Denny's and La Grande Orange would be my preference for a 3-4 star for the sake of the atmosphere but then again you can't park and the O.J. Is equivalent in price to feeding 12 starving kids overseas or 2 kids lunches in America if it's not a hot dog and carrots.)   So keep in mind Chenele. Maybe even tell her she got a review so her shift is a bit nicer yeah?!  Happy eating ppl of the Yelp world!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for her birthday breakfast slam.   We think breakfast is Denny's best meal, and we often get the breakfast at other times of the day.    But the suprise part for us this day was when a young woman, about 10 yrs old with all smiles, and her father walked up to us and said \" I paid for your meal today\".   What a great surprise for us - she was as delighted as we were."}
{"text":"I checked in with the staff to pick up my food. After waiting about ten minutes after the food should have been ready someone else came in and picked up their order right away. Another customer came in and placed an order and was told it would be 10-15 minutes. I asked for an eta and was told my order wasn't ready yet. After I'd been waiting 20 minutes past when the order should have been ready I asked an employee again (third time time I'd tried to get an eta since arriving) she went back and grabbed a bag that had been sitting behind the bar for I have no idea how long... no apology. The food was cold. They were so busy and the waiting area was so congested it wasn't worth being there any longer to complain."}
{"text":"New Denny's Location in Vaughan,ON - 2610 Rutherford  I know it was Valentine's Day and it was busy, but it took long for our food to come and was cold. Also, for the money we paid for our food we ordered we did not get the food that was worth it. We did not expect a big full plate, but we got almost close to nothing and it was cold. We were disappointed for our first visit.   We decided to give it  second chance, and we went again, but for lunch. We were brought to our seat.  We waited and waited for a server to come to our table.   A family was seated after us at the table next to us, they had a server come to their table right away.  I got up and went to the front to speak to the manager, who really did not seem concerned at all, but did send someone to our table right away, who did not even introduced herself to us.  Our food came, the fries were overdone, hard and cold.  I have to admit, they have amazing gravy.   The whole time we were eating the waitress never came over to see if everything was okay, if we were okay, if we wanted a fill up on our water.  When we finished eating she came over and asked if we wanted a fill up on our drink, really......... A different person brought over our bill, the manager not once came over to see if we were okay now, did not even apologize, nothing. This place is not for us, it is so disorganized and slow service.  Food is not worth the money you pay.  Management is not good at all."}
{"text":"Our experience here was great. We came here on a weekday just past midnight. Our server was friendly and very attentive. The place was clean and our food tasted great. I tried a new item on the menu, I believe it was just for the holidays. It was the White Chocolate Raspberry Pancakes. It came with eggs, hash browns, and a choice of sausage or bacon. The pancakes were super fluffy and tasty! It was the perfect amount of sweetness. I would definitely get it again. I wasn't a fan of the hash browns but the rest of my meal tasted good.   **UPDATE November. 25  Absolutely frustrated with the service here at 3am on a Saturday. I ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry pancakes with a bunch of sides. I received my sides an hour later and than my pancakes half an hour later."}
{"text":"We haven't been seated or ordered yet, but the lobby area smells like dirt... seriously like potting soil and there are NO PLANTS in here!!"}
{"text":"Today is my boyfriend's birthday and we came here for breakfast (per his request) and Ralph was so nice and helpful!!! Thanks again for the birthday wishes Ralph!"}
{"text":"Nasty, disgusting food. Everything just looked and tasted terrible (see photos). This place should be closed down."}
{"text":"This visit was disappointing and disgusting. We waited 20mins for a salad. Then to top it off we got a nasty fork with food still stuck on it. They screwed up the salad order and still charged me for everything. I asked the hostess if we could get a new fork because that was dirty she replied \"that looks gross.\" Yes it was gross and her attitude and managers attitude wasn't any better. So if you stop by this dumpster make sure to double check your utensils and cups."}
{"text":"This Denny's used to be a good one but lately the quality of service has declined. We waited about 7 minutes while the staff glanced our way and never asked us if we wanted drinks. A nice young fellow came over and took our drink and food orders. He said that he would not be our server and that \"Tammi\" would be along to take care of us. 25 minutes later no Tammi and no food. Then someone strolled by and informed us that our food should be coming up soon. Sure enough it was brought up by Kate who was nice enough but not our server. Afterward nobody checked on us as they were not our designated servers.  The food was fine and I must admit I would have been upset if it weren't! At the end of our supper \"Tammi\" suddenly shows up with the ticket and asks us if we needed anything else...I immediately said no as I imagined it would be more if a wait.  Now I understand if it was busy, but it was not. Even the manager never checked on us as she walked by a number of times. She also appeared to have a nasty disposition.  I noticed that a lot of the familiar servers are no longer around...they were great! I will have to think twice about coming back...not a happy camper tonight."}
{"text":"Friendly greeting by hostess and a short wait to be seated. Manager came to seat us but his attitude was stand offish like he could care less (he was like that when we paid too).  Very slow service from Jessica G. Who was nice but disappeared after she took our order. I had to get up and ask for my cream for my coffee from another server after about 10 minutes.  The food appeared to take a little longer than usual and the quality was okay to fine (nothing great). I finally got a coffee refill at this time. Of course, we did not see Jessica until she brought the check when she saw that we were done.  Okay food, slow service and a managers stand offish attitude gave an unfavorable impression. I would not recommend or go back."}
{"text":"Best Denny's in the entire Phoenix area.  Has the nicest waitresses and is very clean, friendly and accommodating to kids and special requests. We miss it since we moved an hour away. All the Denny's in Northern Phoenix could learn from this one!"}
{"text":"My experience at this Denny's was one of the best I have ever had.  Parking was easy to find and our wait to be seated was very short.  We were about to come home from a long few days in Las Vegas, and we wanted to eat as quickly as possible and then be on our way.  Our server was very good, and much friendlier than most of the staff that I have encountered at other Denny's.  I ordered the \"Build Your Own Grand Slam\" with pancakes, bacon, sausage and hash browns.  Our waitress asked me if I wanted strawberries on my pancakes, and I emphatically said \"Yes, and with whipped cream too!\"  My friend joked to her if she could put a smiley face on my pancakes.  To my surprise, my pancakes actually did come out with a smiley face!  I had never seen this done before and thought it was pretty cool!  I also added onions and peppers to my hash browns for 50 cents more, and they were superb.  I can't remember ever having a meal at Denny's that was this good before.  Everything was tasty, and I was really happy that we stopped here.  As we were leaving, I saw that it was much more crowded.  I'm sure this Denny's location gets really packed at peak times since it is on the strip.  I would not mind eating here again the next time I am in Las Vegas, but I can't imagine the experience being any better than it was this past weekend when we visited."}
{"text":"This is the worst service I have ever had... We got started fairly quickly and got our drinks but since then it's has been at least 30 minutes since we placed our order nobody has come by to refill our drinks and even trying to get the waitress's attention to refill drinks nothing... We are almost to the point of walking out the service ifs so bad"}
{"text":"So, after my experience with Lane, I wrote \"I'll be coming back\" - and I meant it. My experience the second time, cause my fiancee to in his words ,\"black list\" this place. My server was Jennifer or Jessica, and we felt as if she was new. We were set at a table that all around us had dirty dishes, (we don't mind that, as long as with in 30 minutes they were picked up-- but they were'nt)  I ordered a cup of coffee, and I am a professional barista by trade, and a restaurant manager by occupation. I can tell when a coffee machine is broken, and I can tell when someone has forgotten to change the basket of already brewed beans, and causes watered down coffee. Don't worry though, the waitress recognized it and still served me it. and I was still charged the 2.09 cents for my water with used beans.  My food was of decent quality, my gripe was the in consistency in service."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Denny's in 15 years until now. I ordered the Triple Bacon breakfast. The waitress was very kind and attentive. The coffee was hot.  The only criticism I have was that The order was wrong, I wanted the Turkey Bacon replaced with regular Bacon and The toast didn't arrive until I was a halfway through the meal. Over all the eggs were cooked to order and the taste of the food was fine."}
{"text":"Lets start the new year on a positive note! I have forgiven the past and we have been to this location lots of times since. No complaints...get right in without waiting, service is good , and a huge menu to accommodate any craving....except spaghetti spagetti however its spelled lol. We usually get breakfast (check out the $2$4$6$8 menu for sure). They give a 15% discount if you have an aarp card (anyone 50 or older can get one). Happy new year everyone!"}
{"text":"There is a manhole in the parking lot that reeks a horrible smell of poo and rot that wafts into the restaurant itself. The waitress seemed overworked. Lack of staffing? I ordered a kale salad. There were a bunch of hard kale stems in the salad and they had what appeared to be mildew on the cut ends of the stems. I picked these out and the rest of the salad was ok. We were all kind of sick from the poo smell outside and at least two of us had rumblies in our tumblies later. I would never go back."}
{"text":"My friend and I are on our way to becoming \"regulars\" at the Denny's at Dobson and Chandler Boulevard. We went there this morning around 9:30 for breakfast, and had our usual good service. I ordered the senior waffle, one egg, and bacon. My friend ordered \"one\" scrambled egg that looked like a mini omelet, potatoes, and toast. Our waitress who has taken care of us before was efficient and prompt in filling our ice tea glasses which we really appreciated! She checked with us twice to see how our food was and how we were doing. I have back pain and have started asking our servers if we can pay at the table vs. standing in line, and they always say, \"Yes.\" The food and service is usually good, dependable, and reliable. The servers are courteous and friendly. Overall, we have an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"That 1 star is for the female manager on 6/21/14 at 5:30pm. We went in and she said the wait time for food was 40 minutes encoring us to leave, we stayed because we want to eat, after that she told the server that we were not in hurry.  Really? She was making it seem as we should leave, what manager is so unfriendly and suggest to leave?"}
{"text":"military discount - I support those who support me.   food: good.  the wheat pancakes is a better flavor option than white flour and better taste.  ask to get hash browns crispy and scattered, so the middle isn't wet and undercooked.    bar: above average.  when you get someone there, it's one of the better bargains on the Fremont area, 24/7.  happy hour has $5 drink specials.    service: meh."}
{"text":"This place is alway super fast and the wait staff is really nice but I wish they would clean more. The menus had stuff stuck to them and my daughter was grossed out when she went under the table, she is 2 1/2 years old. Thanks chain restaurant but start to clean it up!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would, our server shayla was nice and understanding, unfortunately the food was terrible ! There was no silverware when we sat at our table, when we asked them for some they finally remembered 40 min later and they were dirty.. my coffee got cold by the time they brought them :( Mac and cheese cold and wasn't even cheesy . quesadilla burnt and dry.. Yuck! soup? More like juice only. Lettuce on the salad wasn't even cut leaves rent cut, Manager came down and asked if we wanted a new plate which was good but we didn't take it, overall a really bad experience and never coming back!! Really disappointed"}
{"text":"It's Denny's people, idk why the low marks. For a cheap quick meal it served its purpose. Wanted a budget breakfast en route to Wet Republic and we found it. Had breakfast and the food was hot, quick and tasty. Everything was clean, nice employees. No tummy issues in our party of 4 so a success!"}
{"text":"Well went here late nite n there wasn't even that many people. 1.serivice was slow 2. My water stayed empty until i called someone 3. Our food came out wrong 4. We got placed in the corner where another server thought no one was. Food was real good though lol. Would i come bak? Umm probably not!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast on the strip! Very affordable! Service is a bit slow but not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"As your sitting in your hotel room & everyone's getting hungry. You remember that you passed a Denny's & the sign read ALWAYS OPEN!!!  So you go for a lovely sunny afternoon walk with the family down to that Denny's we passed on the way in..  To our utter shock & surprise the woman working in the front told us they were closed until 3:30pm explanation or anything..  it was only 1:30pm.. finding it hard to believe, we looked at the sign again upon  walking out to make sure we didn't read it wrong or to see if it was possibly for another shop!! But that wasn't the case.... the sign read \" Denny's ALWAYS OPEN\"!! We were all extremely disappointed by this & went back and got the car & drove around for some time before finding something to eat that we could all agree upon...  I think Denny's should remove the part of the sign that states ALWAYS OPEN or at least edit it to state the random hours that they close.. This type of advertisement is very very misleading to say the least!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Denny's? But the service at this location is the standout difference. Actually, the service here was better than the Omni Hotel where I stayed the night before."}
{"text":"Always good service and nice people that work there, we need more Denny's in the area, their to packed in the morning, and the weekends you can forget about it! People are out the door waiting"}
{"text":"Really wish I could leave negative stars! Uneducated staff... management included. 5 tables and server couldn't get any thing right. Including handling his apparent mistakes. Own up! Serving ain't easy.... leave it to people who can multitask! All I expected was a \"My bad\"..... Prides a big pill ....If you can't handle 3 tables. ...it's not for you .... Corporate should really monitor this locaton!! My biggest gripe was no one ever said \"we apologize\" including manager.... who took 5 minutes to appear.  I knew I shouldn't have expected any different. Last time."}
{"text":"Nothing is more frustrating than having to get up and ask for silverware so you can eat your food. The burger was nasty guess I should have just stuck with breakfast for lunch. Very disappointing! My son ate his whole plate so guess the pancakes were good. Don't like this location at all! I'll stick to the one one lake mead. Not to mention the restrooms are disgusting!"}
{"text":"I've never been to prison but if I had to guess I would say that the quality of food that I got served tonight was the same or worse then what they serve in prison. I've been to this location once before about 5 years ago and the visit tonight reminded me why I will not be back to this restaurant for another 30 to life."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE.   It was my mothers birthday and denny's managed to ruin the entire day because everything from their service to food was disgusting. The manager, RAJ was incredibly rude to us and i will never be returning to Denny's ever again because of this experience. It was sunday morning so it took about 15-20mins to get a table and then it took about 35-40mins for us to get our food for 2 people. i ordered the BACON slam burger which had NO bacon but I didn't complain as i didn't want to ruin my mothers birthday. She ordered the original grand slam which came with the smallest sausages I've ever seen and were also slightly burnt. Her eggs were also overcooked despite asking for eggs over easy.  But the absolute last straw was when I found a HAIR in my burger, I was disgusted to say the least. I complained and then the manager came said sorry and just took both my plate AND my mothers plate without even asking if she was done [she wasn't!]. He then disappeared and nobody came to attend to us.  I kept trying to order 2 coffees but not a single waiter would take my order, I had to get up and physically stop and ask a waitress for a coffee. I NEVER GOT MY COFFEE.   The manager, RAJ came back saying that we didn't have to pay for our meal which we barely ate since he took it away. I told him that we were trying to order a coffee but no one was serving us. He then yelled at us saying that we should have told HIM that we wanted a coffee and that it isn't the waiter's fault for not bringing us our coffee? He continued to yell at us saying that he was walking around [I never saw him] and that we should have asked him instead of complaining.  The only decent person working here was another manager I think, JESSICA, she managed to take care of our bill and got us our coffee [finally]. Everyone else was so incompetent and Just plain rude. Clearly it's too difficult for them to pour some coffee in a mug. My waitress's name was Daniela, she was horrible. Never attended to us and took forever to bring our food even though there were people who arrived after we ordered who got their food way before us! So thanks Denny's for ruining my mothers Birthday! Honestly would have rather gone to McDonalds for breakfast......"}
{"text":"Its a Denny's and we went there mainly because it was the only thing opened at the time.  We had a huge breakfast and everything was pretty good.  Good service.  Good food, but not amazing thus the 3 stars.  This location is kind of dingy looking, but cool they put up big screens to watch while you are eating!"}
{"text":"Went to Las Vegas to get married and stayed at the Venetian Hotel (review is coming) and this Denny's was about a block away. First time for me at Dennys. I have a iHop not too far from home, so I'm used to iHop. Honestly, this Denny's was not too bad, not counting the water stained silverware, at least I hope those were water stains. The food was ok, not great but not bad either. Service was ok also. There was nothing to rave about, but I did end up going twice. First time because it was close to my hotel and a lot cheaper than the food at the hotel, and the second time for the same reasons. Would I go back? Yes. Could be a little bit better all around."}
{"text":"My review is based on the birthday deal. A free meal on your birthday. The free deal consists of 2 eggs ( cooked to your liking), 2 sausages, 2 bacon pieces, and 3 pancakes.   Honestly for a free meal that's really good. At a sit down restaurant with a glass of water. The server was nice. I told her about the deal and asked if she would like to see my id she said it's fine. When I was done I thought I had to pay for taxes . She said nope that's it, have a great day.   No purchase necessary an awesome deal if you ask me."}
{"text":"came in for breakfast this morning. there were four parties ahead of me to be seated. when I put my name on the list (I was a party of two) I was told it'd be 20 minutes for a seat and another 30 minutes for our order to arrive after we had ordered. I told Terri (the host) that was fine. I ordered both of our meals and asked that a caramel iced coffee be delivered with our meal.  we ordered at 10:35 and our food did not arrive until 11:20. 11:20! I wasn't too users that the food had taken 45 minutes (literally) but what did frustrate me was that it sat on a table for 10 minutes before our server brought it to us. no one else offered to run the food so it sat and cooled while we waited.  a plain iced coffee was delivered to me with our food so I pushed it aside as it wasn't what I ordered. I begin to eat when I notice my egg, that I asked was cooked over hard, had wet yolk! I told my server who said he'd send the manager over. the manager came 20 minutes later while I sat without an egg that no one offered to replace. there was no ketchup but our server never came back for us to ask that he bring us some.  when the manager arrived, she told me that she had removed my coffee. I explained the disastrous meal to her and she walked off without saying a thing. once my boyfriend finished his food, we went to pay. the manager sped off as I walked up and left another server to tell us that she had taken care of our meal. I asked that they charge us at least for my boyfriends orange juice so we could leave a tip and the manager came back and told us that it was already taken care of and not to worry about tipping him because he was new anyways.  HORRIBLE experience! rude manager, confused server, cold food.  safe to say that I won't be returning to this chain anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service!   I came here with my friends because I got a 20% off  promo coupon from a brand ambassador. If you ever see one of those poor employees in the bacon strip costume, you better run and grab a few of those coupons.   SERVICE:  It was a little slow but I didn't mind because I wasn't in a rush and had time to catch up with friends. The staff even provided complementary snacks (onion rings + mozzarella sticks) to compensate for the long wait which was so generous of them. The staff were incredibly friendly, always making sure we were doing fine without being annoying.   ATMOSPHERE:  Good place to hang with friends. Generally doesn't get too loud, the place is decent in terms of cleanliness and the tables are roomy.   FOOD/PRICE:  Because I had the coupon, my meal was worth it. For 3 people, our bill came out to under $30 and we were more than satisfied. We each got pancakes, hash browns, eggs and bacon/sausage. Try the strawberry & cream pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Surprised that they're open 24 hours, speaking that, at only 10pm, they're out of the foods or drinks that I want :-) Every. Single. Time.   I mean, come on, really? How can you run out of cheese sticks? Why has your shake machine been broken all day, yet it's still not fixed by night time? How can you only have one cook scheduled for a night shift when you're open 24/7??   Dennys, I don't understand you. Your tumblr seems lit and full of substance, so why aren't you?"}
{"text":"It's Denny's so the food is the same as any other chain. But the staff was awesome and I appreciated their service and attention. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ordered an avocado and lemon, received more lemons then the cados. Paid for whole avocado, did not receive whole avocado. 4/7 would not recommend. However, the coffee was bomb and she made it fresh for me, and boy were those green machines were fresh."}
{"text":"This one star is no reflection upon the one server or the one cook in the kitchen. No dishwasher, and no other staff. This has to do with the fact that this restaurant never has product in house and is always understaffed! The management or owners set no one up for success. Back in the day, me and friends always went to this Denny's and always left well fed. There is no reason why the server must rattle off a list of things that they are out of before she takes the order. She was embarrassed and felt set-up for failure. I've been in this business for 30 years and I would be embarrassed if this was my establishment! Left the server a 100% tip for her frustration, plus she had 2 tables of very non-understanding drunks to deal with."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I experienced what I did tonight. Our family had a bad night and dinner was ruined. So we decided to load up the car and go to Denny's. We arrived to an empty restaurant and was greeted by one of the worst human beings ever. I won't even call her a waitress because she was far from that. She refused to serve my family because there was 11 of us. It's 9:30-10:00pm your restaurant advertises be \"open all night\" but you can't seat us? She goes on to tell us how she can't open up the back area/room for us because there is only one server. I stood there wondering if I was dreaming. She actually turned down tip, and revenue for your company because she didn't want to move some tables around to accommodate us..thus the reason why the place was empty. She has probably turned away so many people they quit coming in. She was rude, had no teeth, and no customer service skills. The whole experience left a nasty taste in my mouth. You should definitely put some more thought into who you hire because this woman is doing your company no justice. I'm almost certain her name was \"Joy\". It's sad that I have personally witnessed Denny's catering wild teens and drunks when the bars close on Friday's and Saturday's but turned down a mother, her 4 kids and grand baby, along with my sister and her three kids. I ended up spending $60.00 at Steak N Shake for my group and left $15.00 tip. You can thank your non-customer service oriented waitress for missing out tonight. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief!"}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars I would, this place is trash. The host did not seat us at all, we waited 20 mins. You lost money pal"}
{"text":"Jesus on Wednesday night at 9:00 pm has done an amazing job tonight. Pleasant and professional greeting, diligent information delivery, and used his time wisely on the job even through the restaurant was empty. Great service :) If he is not the manager, he should be!"}
{"text":"Smiles, smiles, smiles.  Greeted friendly and seated quickly with drinks served within minutes.  How does Denny's get a five star rating?  I would never had thought that I would step foot in a Denny's ever again.  Never before have I had great service or food at a Denny's, it was always  nearly adequate service and just less than eatable food.  Look at the place, everything is yellow and red to include the menu.  It looks completely processed and void of any healthy life enhancing food.  This Denny's did not break the mold and start their own vegan raw food menu, but they had amazing service.  My wife and I came to Vegas on a free trip and the resort where we stayed had no restaurant, but was about one hundred feet from a Denny's so we bit the bullet and slummed over after a long night that included a bottle of wine.  We were surprised at the changes.  There are many substitutions to make your faire closer to a healthy meal.  They let you substitute fruit, chicken sausage, egg whites, and many others.  What made the biggest difference was the amazing service.  The employees must be well compensated, well tipped, or really enjoy their work.  We even saw a few of the server's dancing and singing in the back while doing dishes.  Something is working and we came back the next morning to the same great service."}
{"text":"How the fuck do we get here first & everybody gets their food first. Don't go to there on a Friday night or early Saturday morning. They only have 1 chef & 1 waitress."}
{"text":"I called in an order and placed it with Selyna M. I was on the phone for 10 minutes trying to place an order for two, and was put on hold multiple times throughout the call. The staff did not seem educated on what was on the menu, and repeatedly got my order wrong. Also I specifically asked for a few requests; no cantaloupe in my fruit bowl, no butter on the toast, which was completely disregarded. Then after we took the order and got home, we realized we did not even receive half the food. We usually use a different location but decided to try this one out. Needless to say, we are VERY disappointed with the service we received at this location and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Always good service and they are good at keeping drinks up even when you hang out to study for a few hours. I've been in there at all times of day and night and never had the typical \"bad Denny's\"experience."}
{"text":"Very busy location on the strip. Not very organized. The customers waiting to be seated are EVERYWHERE.. Making it hard to get into or out of the restaurant. Employees seem unhappy. I wonder why. Not the best food I've had at a Denny's. The service was ok. The bathrooms are not very clean. Some tables have a very sophisticated leveling system in place."}
{"text":"This Denny's has fast service. My boyfriend and I always come here. We have tried a couple other Denny's in the area, but this one always has the best service."}
{"text":"Upon arrival my family and I walk into the restaurant and are over taken by the smell of a shit filled diaper. That alone took our appetite away.  We decide to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and still eat there. We get to the counter to be seated and stood there for 10 minutes while the restaurant was very slow. After the said amount of time, the host came from the back area smelling heavily of marijuana.  We were sat in a booth in the front of the restaurant where the service was less than acceptable. Our server took our drink orders and then proceeded to the back with the host who was high and began socializing. 10 minutes later we receive our drinks.  After receiving our food we began eating, we found bugs crawling on the table under the plates. At this point we couldn't wait to leave. We get to the front counter where a homeless male was loitering in the lobby. Remember the lobby area already smelled of dirty diapers, thus homeless guy is not helping. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"When we hit the road from Cleveland heading back to Chicago, we decided we'd stop for breakfast somewhere along our great westbound travels.  This Denny's isn't really much different than the others.  The menu is the same, and my Superbird was just as greasy and satisfying as any other location makes.  We also shared the Strawberry Pancake Puppies.  They were served with a white chocolate sauce/frosting.  They tasted more like donuts than pancakes, but these little pups were good enough that I might seek out Denny's sooner rather than later for another breakfast.  The restaurant and tables were clean, and the service was attentive.  It's a good option in the area for breakfast or lunch.."}
{"text":"Great diner food! When coming to Denny's you have to understand you're at a diner! It's not top quality food. But the food is good for being a diner.  Chicken strips and French fries - can't ever go wrong with that."}
{"text":"I love that this Denny's is categorized as a gay bar! Perfectly nicknamed Jenny's, this chain diner is located in a known gay district of Phoenix, so you can imagine my disappointment when my wife and I walked in for breakfast on a Monday morning and discovered a totally normal Denny's! Where were the drag queens and disco balls and the loud techno music? Ok maybe I wasn't really expecting all that... regardless, it had been ages since I've been to Denny's, and not much has changed. The service is slightly above average and the mediocre food is an amazing hangover cure.... however the prices have gone up at some point during the last 6 years.... guess that's inflation for you. We both crushed the Grand Slam breakfast and overtipped our waitress, who was impressively a bilingual white chick! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy!  One of best Denny's i've ever been to.  Tucked upstairs, near Harrah's, Monte Carlo and Vegas Strip, I had one of the freshest, yummy breakfasts at a Denny's.  Even the eggs were still steaming.  Great view and staff too.   Plus, if it is your birthday, the Grand Slam is freee!  *****"}
{"text":"Dear Manager hire more cooks wow one hour wait. One star for coffee refill and water............................................................."}
{"text":"Worst service ever experienced. Came here twice. Both times on a busy and non busy day. Had to walk out after 45 minutes with no food. Terrible. Management should be fired and fined."}
{"text":"Ok so here is the deal, I will try almost any place that has a loyalty program and that sends me coupons (Yes, Restauranteurs that is an open invitation to send me coupons). That being said it is standard diner food, with several creative additions (Red Velvet Pancake Puppies). The place is clean and quiet. So if you are not looking for anything fancy, stop by give it a try. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"everytime we go to this Dennys we have nothing but problems. the staff never check on you. they can't even do what you ask of them. and then they had us sit in the middle of there \"construction\" zone. they kept banging tables and chairs around, stiring up dust.  And running there drills. It was horrible. I really don't like the way they run this place at all."}
{"text":"Ok so it's a Denny's. I am mourning the demise of the Baconallia menu. Fear not I was allowed to have the Bacon Brownie, are you kidding me? Now of course once they run out of the materials, then its really over, but the point is (not only to create a horribly structured run on sentence) but to let you know that the staff and especially the night manager, will go the extra mile to make the customer happy, sadly a rarity in this day and age. So if you are on the West Side, God help you (Hey just kidding) Stop in. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"The worst. Got sick after ordering and eating at this location. Wanna get sick, eat here. Nuff said."}
{"text":"I stopped by Denny's for a quick breakfast on my way to a conference.  I eat frequently at Denny's.  I was not thrilled with this location.  It is a high traffic location.  It's very busy.  The restaurant smelled like an armpit.  The food came promptly.  The service was okay.  The food was served on a collection of proper plates and styrofoam cups.  I didn't find this location to be very clean.  I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"I we'll give this location some credit they had messed up on one of my orders to go last week and then replace it without any problems so for that I appreciate it I can add another star back on here"}
{"text":"We have eaten breakfast here awhile back and it was pretty good. Reason for the 2 stars.  I happened to get a craving for apple pie. I stopped off, around midnight, and the place was busy enough to slow my order down. I ordered coffee and apple pie ala mode. MISTAKE!! The apple pie was really doughy and the coffee tasted like they created a new pot with OLD grounds. EGADS!! The best part was eating the ice cream.  I probably should have stopped off at Mickey Dees across the street, from what I hear their coffee has a lot more flavor than here."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Denny's in years bc I always had a bad experience in the past, but something drew me there today. The food and service were SO GOOD! I got egg whites mixed with bellpeppers, onions and tomatoes, avocado and fruit, with an English muffin. Super healthy and yummy! I asked the cook to make it with Pam instead of butter and they willingly accommodated! This was great! Definitely recommend! The server (Matt!) was AWESOME! Come and visit--worth it!"}
{"text":"Every time I've gone to this location it's been excellent. Great service, food, and ambiance. The decorations are so cool! Adds a really nice homey feeling. I drive past another Denny's just to come to this one!"}
{"text":"Needs help with the staff. Went on Saturday and only a manager was on.. there was a good amount of tables and she seemed to be more concerned about yelling at the staff she cut and cleaning tables more than talking care of customers that needed to be greeted. Was stuck at Denny's for a hour and a half when it should of been a quick easy dining experience."}
{"text":"The  food was iight!!! The nachos were surprisingly delicious. Nice server. I felt like I paid to much."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning. It's a pretty busy place, we didn't mind waiting.  We had a great waiter, i wish I caught his name. The person who came to bring the food passed hot food plates over several of us instead of going to the other side of the table, she handed me a very hot plate without even giving any consideration to how hot the plate was. As we were wrapping up our meal, I notice another waitress with orange hair bringing her table their food. She carried the food at her shoulder level and her hair was in the food, literally sitting on the plate of pancakes. I was so horrified. She came around and served another table and again, her hair just sitting right on the food.  Well, I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I've read several bad reviews but we had a very good breakfast and dinner there in the past couple of days. The service was fine and the servers we had were very nice. It is not fancy chef type food that you would get at the casinos, it was standard Denny's decent priced. We would come here again next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I received poor service and my food was awful. I go to Denny's all the time. I'm a server myself. But from the minute we walked in I didn't have high expectations. The host didn't acknowledge us until a lady came in. She asked for how many and I said for two. We were standing there for 3 minutes. She was referring to the lady that had just walked in but she replied \"oh you were here first\" and finally sat us. Our server didn't come around for a while. It was the afternoon and it began to slow down. When our food came out it was all wrong. We also had to ask for butter, syrup, straws and silverware. He didn't come back to check on us. Our food got cold. My friend changed her order through another server. I didn't want to complain until I realized my pancakes were raw in the middle and my toast was burned. I asked for new toast but I didn't get it for another 20 minutes. The manager then gave us 15% off because we still payed for our food. All this could have been avoided and I would not likely come back. The other servers were nice and I could overhear them tend to their tables and were very attentive. I just hope next time I go anywhere I receive the same service as anyone else."}
{"text":"stopped by this location. waited to be seated. no one acknowledged me for  the whole 7 minutes i waited. then some people got ready to pay. guess how many waitresses were there ti charge out in an instant. made sure to collect never acknowledging me. i was furious. that is very shitty service!!!! not the first time they do that.  they also served me wilted lettuce for my salad. i am  done with this denny's. they suck!"}
{"text":"Ordered food online. Waited the recommended 20min arrived and the waiting area was crazy packed and disorganized observed a couple leave because the host didn't take there names. Ask about picking up my order front desk person didn't seem too know where order was asked someone about it. I watched them go grab a receipt off a printer and I'm assuming place the order with the cooks. Didn't say anything to me. So I just assumed no one out the order in yet so I proceeded to wait. Waited ten more minutes and asked counter lady who went to check on order and seemed to take matters in her own hands as I saw her going and talking to the cooks and putting the order together. Finally got order front lady was legit. Drove 10 min Home. Food was warm. Pumpkin creme pancakes I give 3 stars. Decent but not amazing. Mind you this was too go and not straight from the kitchen. The bacon was ok limp and and not warm. The eggs I didn't eat. I got the cheddar hash browns and the cheddar was sprinkled on but not melted which is a major downside for me.  I had a side of the hash brown bacon cheddar puppies. Ehhh they were cold by the time I got to them and fell apart. I finished with a slice of pumpkin pie. It seemed average the crust was kind of soggy. All in all got what I paid for I suppose and I'd eat there again for the value I suppose."}
{"text":"This is my second night coming to this Denny's. The first time I came I had French Toast, which I recommended. It is delicious. This time I ordered the salted caramel and cream pancakes, scrambled eggs with cheese, and hash browns. The hash browns don't taste all the way done. The eggs are pretty good but the pancakes have just became my favorite. When I come back I'll definitely be eating these again, just no hash browns."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Our host didn't ask us if we wanted a booth or table but asked everyone else. That was the only problem. I also tried strawberry pancake puppies which are delicious. I recommend trying them."}
{"text":"I don't care what people say. Denny's is awesome. Sat down at 9am, ordered my food, and had the food by 9:07am. Everyone was working together. One lady took my order and when she was busy another lady brought the food to my table. ridiculously fast service. The waitress checked up on every 5 min to make sure I was OK. Had the lumberjack slam. Everything was great, but the pancakes were a little undercooked. All in all, this Denny's location gets a solid rating."}
{"text":"We come here a lot, sadly.There aren't a lot of breakfast places in the area besides Dennys and IHOP, and IHOP is terrible. So, we end up here.  Sometimes the service is great and the food is good. But most times, the servers are only friendly to their regulars/daily customers and they are short tempered, and rude. They gossip loudly with their coworkers at the servers station, and make for an unpleasant dining experience. Today we sat right in front of the counter and our server walked up and just said \"Drinks?\". A hello would be nice or maybe a complete sentence.  The food was mediocre, and slow to come out.  I guess we will start making the drive to another part of town for breakfast. This place doesn't deserve my business."}
{"text":"If you like waiting....forever, for mediocre food and crap service this is the place for you. We have come here a handful of times and hope that they will redeem themselves, but they haven't . We were asked  on this visit \"Will anyone be needing refills soon? Just checking if you want me to come back.\" Um, well it's your job to come back to check on your table at some point..right?! Veggie omelet was burnt and disgusting and we were served the wrong drinks. So done with this Denny's."}
{"text":"Looking for breakfast this  is morning and all I could find is 'tis Dennys. I was hesitant to go in but what I found was a great staff and decent food.  If you get the opportunity. Stop in and have Jerrett serve. You. He is respectful and attentive   If fact there was a customer that couldn't pay his bill. And it looked like Jerrett was going to pay for him until two other customers insisted to cover the mans bill Good. Job everyone. I will come back"}
{"text":"I think we ate at this Denny's 3 mornings in a row while staying in Vegas. Don't know if it's because I haven't had Denny's in a long time or if this one was just really good, but I enjoyed every one of my meals here. I had one of the veggie breakfast skillets with a side of turkey bacon each morning and it was the perfect meal to start my day. They also do a 2/4/6/8 menu where you can get a steal on some breakfast items. My boyfriend had like a $4 breakfast Sammy which looked legit. If you go around 9 there shouldn't be a line or wait for a table."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. They just have such bad attitudes and very rude. I get it that they are busy. I have been in situations before where I has been busy and never once did I give attitudes to my customers. The server didn't want to substitute from pancakes to toast and said it's already a value and discounted. The general manager did a \"one time\" courteous substitution and said that its a corporate store. Bullsh**! My husband is a diabetic so he told them it's a medical concern. They showed no remorse and the server wasn't even from our section. The male server, for some reason, didn't make it back in time to serve us or he didn't want to serve us at all. But I know one thing for sure, that I WILL NOT return to this location again."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's what more can you say? Grand slam, endless cups of coffee, good people watching. Fed the family for $25 with tip and we left stuffed."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's ever. Super rude manager. I ordered a burger and they neglected to tell me they needed to defrost it and they served my friends their food and when they finished eating it was still not done. I said forget about the burger and was given no apology by the manager. Never again. I would've ordered something else if I knew that. The no apology and rudeness gives this place a 1 Star review for me. If I could I'd give them 0 stars."}
{"text":"We have been to this Denny's many times in the past and we have never had this terrible of service. It started with not recieving the lemon I had kindly asked for with my water. Then when I recieved my lemon-there was a black hair on it. The waitress was unapologetic and laughed that it might be her purple hair. Then when I had asked for chicken noodle soup,  all she said was \"we are out.\" So naturally we asked for just a few more minutes and it took her no less than fifteen minutes to return to take our order. We then waited no less than 40minutes for our food to take our order. In that time we didn't see our waitress once, so when we needed more creamer for our coffee, we needed to ask another server. Though I will say shortley after our order was taken, the manager did come by and ask if we were okay and at that point we were fine. (We had no idea our food would take nearly an hour). After our food was given to us we needed to find the other waitress, Kia, to get us refills.  All in all, the service provided was just awful."}
{"text":"Very good Denny's with all the usual Denny's fare and an incredible staff.  Very cool vintage diner style too."}
{"text":"First time being here in nearly 10 years. Denny's is dependable American fare at reasonable prices. Met family here for a quick breakfast.  We had the Supreme Skillet with jalape√±os and scrambled eggs, supreme omelette with jalape√±os, and two grand slams.  Food was served hot and quick.  However, I remembered why I don't visit  often. Loud children and half-assed service. We fed four people a hearty breakfast with tip for $55.  I prefer Black Bear Diner though."}
{"text":"I ordered the Supreme Skillet and a substitution of the pork sausage. I ended up eating pork sausage. I reported the issue to the manager. The manager replaced my order pork free. However, the waitress came back and argued with me. She was very disrespectful . She came back and apologized. I need to find a new place for breakfast ASAP,"}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. Actually, one of the nicest I've been in. But still a Denny's. Staff is friendly. Service took a little longer than expected, but probably because it was packed. Prices are normal and not over-inflated because it's on the strip. Good place to grab a bite if you're in the mood for Denny's.... Oh, and they've got beer and wine too!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible, always down on staff, rarely is anyone friendly and welcoming and when or If you bring up any issues to management/manager \"Jose\", he just brush it off and does nothing.   This manager is lazy, unprofessional and does nothing to help his staff. Our waitress seemed to be serving the entire restaurant and check out customers at the register. Manager Jose did nothing to help, walked to the back and just disappeared where his staff couldn't even find him.   WORSE PLACE TO TAKE YOUR FAMILY FOR ANY MEAL..."}
{"text":"Where do I begin...I went there for breakfast this morning and ordered a ham and cheese omelette and ask them to add white onions (which they charge .49 for by the way), really? I also ordered a milk to come with the meal but I wanted the kid's size which is in a plastic cup but a little smaller because their large milk is way too much and I don't like to waste. The waitress insisted they are the same size...they're not (I've had this many times) so finally I agreed to her large milk (didn't want to argue). The waitress doesn't listen and cuts me off twice in mid-sentence so finally I gave up. She doesn't listen. I asked for my pancakes to be on a large plate and she cuts me off and says it'll be on a separate plate. I explained that the syrup runs off the plate when the pancake takes up the whole plate. Okay, now all the sudden I hear the waitress tell the cook that the onions are supposed to go INSIDE the omelette, not under the hash browns...WOW! LOL really? So she comes over to ask me if I minded the onions being under the hash browns. I said I really wanted the onions to be in the omelette LOL. She huffs a little and says then we'll remake it. Meanwhile she brought the pancakes on a plate that was too small and no room for syrup to run off (a pet peeve of mine), and brought the milk (I specifically asked for the milk when the meal was ready, but she doesn't listen). Then I heard the cook arguing with her about who was right and who was wrong about the onion mix-up situation. By this time, I got up and walked out and went to The Village Inn which I don't care for as well for Breakfast, but at least the service there was great and the food timely and cooked to my desire. They offered a small milk also. I don't think I will go back to that Denny's until they fire this waitress that was completely incompetent and rude (by cutting me off, arguing about the milk, and not listening to me and as a result my satisfaction was not met).....there you have it. 6/27/17 @ 5:30 am"}
{"text":"I walked in. There was a group of four ahead of me. It took 15 minutes for the hostess to even acknowledge that I was standing there, 3 feet in front of them. Another 3 minutes to be seated. It was not completely full, as there were at least 15 empty tables/booths. At least they support our military veterans."}
{"text":"Took spouse and kids out for dinner. It was mediocre at best. Definitely could have been better. Food was good and service was decent. It took 15 minutes to receive 2 extra pancakes for the \"all you can eat\" pancakes. Severely slow"}
{"text":"Food is as-expected, just ok.  Prices are more than fair. I've spent more at McD, for less. Decor is modernized! Very clean."}
{"text":"the place was clean compared to what others have said. we enjoyed our lunch and everything was prepared as expected. We were told we could get a 10% discount after we checked into Great wold lodge. We just needed to show our arm bands on return visits. the food did take a good while to come and there wasn't a lot of people in the place."}
{"text":"Down here waiting for VLV20 to start! This dennys has been one of the best one so far, away a bit from the strip and the crowd, food was great and service was amazing. Jose B was our waiter and his service was on point!!!! Will defiantly be coming back to eat here soon!!"}
{"text":"Waited for a table about 25-30 minutes but it was understandable becuase this place was packed.  We actually walked down to the Hard Rock instead but they stopped serving breakfast 2 minutes before we came in.  I hate when places do that.  If they were smart they could prob take a lot of Dennys' crowd.  Anyways back at Dennys.............Do not let them seat you next to the front pay counter.  Thats where we were and people were lined up inches away from our table with their butts closer than desired.  The waitress was trying really hard but if the kitchen staff is blowing it the waitress suffers.  They told us that they didnt have a kids menus but come to find out what they really meant was that they had no more kids menus.  Would have been nice to know seeing as how my two year old would have wasted a regular portion.  A bit scandalous I think.  We ordered and 45 minutes later (literally 45 minutes) we got our food.  My eggs oredered over easy might as well have been hard boiled eggs cut in half.  My hashbrowns were burnt on the outside and raw pots on the inside.  My gf found a hair on her sausage!  I brought the attention to the waitress when she passed by our table and she offered to have the things remade.  I didnt feel like waiting another 45 minutes and said I just wanted it taken off the bill seeing as how I didnt eat any of it.  She copped a bit of an attitude.    Bad experience but places like this and Shari's are really hit-or-miss.  It really depends on whos working up front and in the back.   Pretty much everything in Vegas food wise is pretty expensive but at least the service and quaity is there for the most part when your paying top dollar."}
{"text":"Our server Danny was very friendly and full of energy. He came around often to check on us, and of course the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Not a good experience here at all. My husband and I stopped in to have breakfast on our way out of town. We weren't expecting a gourmet meal at Denny's but we did expect to have a meal like we ordered. The host boy took our drink order and said he would be right back, never showed up with our drinks. Waitresses were walking all around for about 10 minutes before another girl came and took our drink order again and food order. About 10-15 minutes later a different waitress showed up with half of the food we ordered. I was missing 2 eggs and bacon and my husband was missing his bacon. She took my entire plate to go have it fixed and never showed back up with our order. Then about 10 minutes later she came and asked what we were missing from our order. At that point we said we want our check so we can pay and leave. They took their time and eventually sent another waitress over to give us our bill. I didnt think working at Denny's was so difficult. There was another irritated couple next to us that had been waiting an hour for their food and their ticket got lost. Horrible experience haha"}
{"text":"The service is terrible. Every time we go it seems like it takes forever to even get a beverage. Tonight was worse than most, their milkshake/smoothie machine wasn't working correctly and instead of telling us it took the guy till our food was on the table to bring our kids their shakes and they looked awful!  The manager sits at the counter and watches while the servers run around trying to handle the customers without the tools necessary to do their jobs. I know that it's Dennys and I shouldn't expect much but there is something to be said for friendliness. The food was good though,"}
{"text":"A WRAITH OF AMERICANA LONG UNDEAD, CHURNING OUT CACA AT OUTRAGEOUS PRICES  --$3.50 slice of ham --$4.00 glass of concentrated OJ --3am best time to visit; you're going to be sick in an hour anyway from the booze you drank earlier.  --no \"honey\"-calling, gum-chewing flos anywhere to be seen --only the blur-in-motion Mexican-girl dishwasher/busers who can clear a table in 3.8 seconds --24-7 operation means this place never gets a deep clean and it shows --bathroom towels NEVER stocked --window blinds caked in mud --buser station crusty with layers of splattered milk and grease  And the food is atrocious.  Not even grilled cheese makes it past the gag reflex  Get me outa here!!!"}
{"text":"This place was HORRIBLE! It's extremely small I am almost sure it was a Mc Donald's  Before it was a Denny's. On a busy Sunday there is no place to wait in comfort. The AC sucks & they don't accommodate seating for large families. We waited more them 25min for them to say it will take longer to seat us cause it would be a fire hazard. Sad thing is NONE of us are over weight. They could not accommodate a seating for the baby in a high chair."}
{"text":"The menu has changed some, since I use to frequent Denny's, seems smaller.  Food was good, a bit too much oil (Prime rib skillet).  Prices are super good, they now have a $2, $4, $6 menu with a good amount of choices.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I've tried this location a few times because I want breakfast for dinner and I'm always disappointed. I ordered their pumpkin cream pancakes that said pumpkin pancakes with pumpkin cream and they were just regular pancakes...false advertising much? Also, the bacon here is one of the saddest bacon that I've ever seen. The service here can't save it either. The servers are nice but they're not around much and they forget your toast even though they told you it would come right after it's put into the toaster. Also, they changed their pancake recipe and it's not the same (in a bad way)."}
{"text":"Truely appreciate that Denny's was open today and the staff was kind and food was good!  I know it must be difficult to work on the holiday but they did it with kindness and my family was very grateful.  Going to a restaurant and returning my brother to his halfway house with a receipt showing that's where he went was the only way for us to be together for the holiday.  Had they not been open and treated us so nicely our family holiday may not have been so happy.  I just wanted to take the time to thank you."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Denny's one night before a movie because it's quick and easy (and cheat day). We had a great experience which I've never really had at a Denny's. Gemini was our server and he was on top of it. Good food and good times."}
{"text":"Waited a half hour for breakfast. Watched everybody else get served. Had a meeting to go to so I couldn't enjoy it. On top of that everyone's breakfast was cold. No time to send it back. Not a good experience"}
{"text":"Trying this 'Classic Dennys'. First, if your not a patient person, move along. This would not be the Dennys for you. Food took 18 mins to come out and it wasn't even busy. Our server,  Judy was a delight,  full of energy. Food was piping hot n fresh.  Quiet, with mainly retirees during our breakfast stop, it was a relaxing atmosphere. 4 out 5 only because I was on a time crunch and the food came out after 18 mins. Bottom line, this is a very laid back Dennys, hence the name Classic Dennys."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Denny's! Such a great spot for breakfast or a late night bite. Yummy food and great service. The waitresses are really sweet as well"}
{"text":"dennys was the best restaurant when I was a teenager. as you get older and have acquire a taste for real food and not a cafeteria joint.  I stopped being a fan of dennys when I was 21. it became something I rather not eat and just starve. I don't expect a lot from dennys, unless Im drunk and need food to sober up. I just think your better off hitting up a drive thru instead."}
{"text":"So I gave it two stars, only because my original server Luis' attitude and lack of service was very off putting. Being in the service industry myself, I was very disappoint and so were my friends. The hosts were kind at first, but the host just didn't understand that we didn't want a person at our booth to sit in the sun, and although the restaurant was but there were a ton of booths left where it shouldn't have been that much confusion about a booth change. Then there was the 20 minutes of waiting without service. Once Luis actually decided to grace us with his presence, he complained about having 8 other tables. You should never, ever do that as a server. Then we waited longer for another server and almost left, until two people from management came over to take our order. Sonya put in our orders and somehow our orders still got messed up with our drinks. I asked for strawberries and whipped cream, and she sent out the whipped cream & strawberries in this sauce on the side. That's not even close to what I wanted or expected, especially when I specified I wanted it on my waffle. A busser named Ryan was the only person who actually took care of us, & he isn't even a server. The overall experience was saved but the pancakes were awful. I wouldn't come back nor recommend this location unless they promote Ryan to serve or train their employees on customer service."}
{"text":"Ask to sit outside, if you can! The patio is wide, clean, and fresh air goes great with a Grand Slam. Very kind manager working the day we called to see if we could bring our dog with us before we had to run off to her dog training. She said they don't normally allow pets out there, but since there was nobody outside, she would allow it unless someone complained. We got there, passed the pup over the gate, and had brinner like champs while watching the traffic. The manager came by to check on us and even brought out a bowl of water for Tatum. Like everyone says, it's Denny's food... what do you expect? But I think the hospitality makes all the difference."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible, we walked in sat down had a terrible smell. The waitress was not at all motivated took forever !!! Also I have history with Denny's on Grand Ave as well I thought I give it another try... But then the same thing that happened to me happened to my son, half way into his shake there was some type of paper in it ewwww!!!!! That happened to me too but at the other location. Never will I go back Denny's I'm done!! IHOP is my new place if that or biscuits cafe !"}
{"text":"Located in the Fiesta Henderson Casino this place is a locals hot spot for weekend breakfast. No long lines. Fast & friendly service.  Great prices $3.99 Grand Slam breakfast. Feed a family of 3 for under $20!  Don't forget to tip your waitress! :)"}
{"text":"A standard Denny's now located where the \"gamblers grill\" used to be in the Wild Wil West Casino.  So Long $1.49 Breakfasts!! They still have a $3.99 Grand Slam but this was one of the last breakfast specials here in Las Vegas.  The place has been completely remodeled-no more private boothes, but it looks new & fresh but still the same size.  The food is standard Denny's-the McDonalds of sit-down restaurants!  3 people with cofffee & Grand Slams $30!  Coffee was ok, nothing special, pancakes are NOT made fresh must be frozen then microwaved. The hashbrowns are NEVER crispy BUT they really load you up on the bacon & sausage.  I don't like this dumpy casino so I won't be driving out of my way to make a trip back to this Denny's . So Long Vegas Specials & \"Gamblers Grill\"! We Will Miss You!! :("}
{"text":"I will never return. No silverware, no napkins. Not one time were drinks refilled. Had to go looking for my bill and a to go box. I tell who I believe is the manager and got a \"sad face\" from her. Seriously our weekly Saturday dinner will be anywhere but this establishmentI would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"How could I pass this up. FREE Grand Slam breakfast to anyone showing up from 6am-2pm.  This is Vegas so anytime there FREE food to be found people crawl out from under their rocks and show up.  Knowing this I went early at 6am to this location across from the College of Southern Nevada in the Wal-mart shopping center.  When I arrived it was fairly busy but no line or wait.  Service was fast & friendly they were very excited about the big promotion.  We ordered coffee & water-we both got scrambled eggs,2 bacon,2sausage linkss and 2 pancakes.  They food was pretty good. Fresh and hot but still just fast food. I like my bacon crispier and I like hashbrowns instead of pancakes but what they hell it's FREE,right?  The service was really good so we tipped $5 and spent $5 on coffee for 2 people NOT Bad.   By the time we ate & paid there was a line out the door and past the first 3 stores in the shopping center. I drove by again around Noon and the line was still out the door.  I did not let that deter me...........read my other review"}
{"text":"After eating breakfast here during their FREE Grand Slam promo. I thought I'd hit a few more during the day.  I drove to 2 other locations before I stopped in here. This promotion publicized very well. Alot of people must haved called in and every senior on the planet was in line for some grub.  This time around I took the free grand slam but I also ordered some Hashbrowns and toast. I decided to be bold and order my eggs sunny side up-what the hell their free so if they fail no biggie.  I was very impressed-my eggs were perfect-the hashbrowns slightly crispy and my toast was not burnt.  This one was much better than the 1st but the refills were a little slow coming and this place wasn't nearly as busy as the others.  Well after being completely egged out for the day we both got some cheesecake for dessert. They have 3 new flavor-we tried turtle & raspberry. Incredible for a fast food diner.  Next time I'm starting with the dessert."}
{"text":"I'm a veteran of the United States Army, wanted to have breakfast at Denny's and participate in their appreciation for veterans today. They have advertisement that veterans can come and get a free breakfast on today. I called ahead of time and spoke with someone to check and make sure it was correct, she told me just come in and let us know you're a veteran. Once I arrived I told the lady that I just called and she said okay come this way and she's set me at a table. I ordered the American slam breakfast and assuming that everything was fine as far as the veteran appreciation discount. After leaving a tip for my server who was excellent, I went to the front register and the MANAGER there told me that I should have picked the build your slam breakfast to get the veterans appreciation discount. I asked him could he give me the amount off on this breakfast that the pick your slam breakfast would have been, he said NO. If you truly were intending to show your appreciation for veterans I think it would be a short stretch for a manager to give a veteran the amount of the pick your breakfast off of the American slam breakfast. I'm just saying I don't feel very appreciated right now"}
{"text":"Zero- No stars- Never again-  Is that enough?  Don't visit- it's a waste of time-  45 minutes till food after we ordered- Offered Tabasco- disappeared for ever-   I wanted to walk out three times-   The toast I ordered ... Is still being converted from its bread form in the kitchen I guess"}
{"text":"This place really needs to get new servers as well as new kitchen stuff. The service gets worse each time and the food never comes out right so we decided after our experience today never to go to this location again."}
{"text":"Late night staff does not care about making your food. They must be on auto pilot because I got a quesadilla with cheese that was not melted and super soggy pancakes. But the milkshake was enjoyable so I can't complain about that."}
{"text":"Was there two weeks ago. I was so excited to eat at Denny's as it used to be my favorite breakfast/diner spot.  Food was expensive, seriously, $10 for a BLT and fries? Son ordered a burger, and he usually loves eating out and eats a lot.  He took about three small bites and just ate the fries. Spent about 30$ for my 13 year old and myself with 20%+ tip. Not the waitresses fault, she was good.  Will be going to the diner across the street from now on after our weekly weekend early practices.  If I'm gonna spend $30 bucks for two people, it sure won't be at Denny's"}
{"text":"Love his place coming since I was a kid! Right across the street from my high school. People are always friendly never too busy and food is typical Denny's dinner food. Love it! Four stars bc everytime I ask for over easy never quite yolky enough. Lol other Han that nachos and moons over my hammy are my fave here! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Busy in the morning. Waiters were attentive and pretty good for a quick food joint."}
{"text":"As far as Dennys goes, appearance is typical. Getting out in the parking lot we were greeted by a nasty raw sewage smell, not sure if its a Dennys issue or a city issue. Either way, not cool. Inside continued the smell clearly covered up by heavy perfumey fabuloso type cleaner smell which made it smell like ben gay and butt. Ordering was the usual. Our waitress was nice and that was the only good thing about our visit. Food came out fairly quickly but wasnt right. I had requested the eggs on the side as i dont eat eggs and they werent. Hash browns were raw and topped with a single black hair. My hair may be 7 different colors but black isnt one of them. I had also ordered bacon and was served sausage. The waitress didnt apologize for the hair or plating incident but did comp my meal. Based on smell and order messup aside from the hair, we wont be back to this location."}
{"text":"This is nothing but a greedy money making scam. I had to go to the front counter to get my drinks refilled.   Then the waitress brings the bill before i had any dessert and i wasnt even finished eating. Im fucking sick of people being greedy and money hungry. Ive never scammed anyone. Im not that dishonest and anyone that truly knows me can tell you that."}
{"text":"This is my second time ever coming to Denny's. And I regret it each time...when everything around you is hella expensive and wait time is too long, you can only turn to the coupons being handed to you on the streets.   I came here on Wednesday night (12/30/15) around 7 PM. Surprisingly, there was actually a wait list! We waited about 25 minutes before we were seated.   We ordered: -1 Ultimate Omelette // This was actually one of the dishes that was piping hot! Good size, decent quality. Something that I can definitely make on my own.   -1 (senior) tilapia // ERRR....very small portion. Comes with two sides that you can choose from! But decent, if you want to get something \"healthy\". But of course, you will have to be 52 years old (and above) first....  -1 BYO Half Sampler // We chose mozzarella sticks and chicken tenders. I actually liked these! Reminds me of the frozen ones I could bake from Costco.  -1 Bourbon Bacon Burger // HUGE! Awesome portion. The fries on the side were churro looking fries, and they were stale cold but still yummy.   -1 Bourbon chicken skillet // Coldcoldcold. I don't even know what to say...such a disappointment even though the picture (first time I have to judge you, photo!) looked a lot better. It felt like two pieces of grainy chicken with some sloppy sauce poured over it. Skillet wasn't even sizzling!   -1 slow cook pot roast // One of the dishes our server recommended us. It's tasty! But expensive for the quantity (surprisingly) and not hot either.   -1 (senior) grilled chicken // ERRRRR. Sure. Just a note, it's on the senior menu. You can choose two other sides with this.   Pros: -Nice service. They try, they really do. But it's kind of difficult to eat when your server spills hot water all over the table.... -Great view? I don't know if it was intentional, but they are facing right across from Mirage. Volcano shows at 7 PM, 8 PM and 9 PM!   Cons: -Everything was cold. My skillet? Didn't even hear a sizzle.  -Just really, really mediocre/below average food. I bet my brother could have done better! -Things add up. AKA it's pricey for the quality of the food!   Tips/Observations: -If we didn't get a discount, I would not consider this as even a last resort...  Overall, never coming again though I might just get a coffee so I could watch the show from the second floor."}
{"text":"Aimee the server is extremely rude, and needs some training on her serving. My friend asked a simple question and she responded with attitude while rolling her eyes. Get a new job"}
{"text":"This place is shit show, terrible service. Servers are fighting and swearing in front of customers and other employees. No manager here to handle the situation between employees. Uber eats orders are being cancelled because the food hasn't been dropped at all. The food is terrible, I would not recommend this place. This place used to be good, but this place has changed."}
{"text":"I can't believe this dennys only has 3 stars? Every time my boyfriend and I come here it's never crowded, get served and our orders taken right away :) and the staff is really nice. The food is always excellent! I highly recommend the grand slamwich, although last time I went I got the Brooklyn spaghetti and meatballs it was very filling :) and as always a strawberry lemonade! This dennys just feels really homey to me, I like this one and wouldn't go to any other dennys in town."}
{"text":"Worst. Breakfast. Ever.   I wanted to like this spot. It was a free breakfast promotion through MGM, so I had very low expectations....even so, I left feeling as if I'd been robbed...   Watered down coffee. Rubbery eggs. But the worst was the sausage patty that purported to be chicken, but I suspect cardboard was the main ingredient.   It is all set in a bowling alley of a dining room, and the coffee always managed to be cold by the time it was poured into my cup.   It WAS a free breakfast. You get what you pay for. You couldn't pay me to eat there again ...."}
{"text":"Ordered a Avocado Chicken w/o mayo Sandwich for pickup. Received a chicken sandwich w/ mayo & no avocado. At least the fries were not greasy & tasted good."}
{"text":"Our server was really nice, excellent at getting what we needed (3 children) however the length of time it took to get the food was pretty long....the restaurant was pretty empty, so the food should have been a little quicker and appropriate temp. We go here for a casual breakfast on occasion, it is usually ok...  nothing fancy...restaurant is clean, quality of food is.....ok....."}
{"text":"This is one of the Dennys we usually go to for breakfast when the whole family wakes up on the wrong side of the bed.  Our servers name was Lourdes for the day and besides her professionalism, she is the definitely the cutest employee there. So i went the route that avoided sweets this time and ordered the Sante Fe Skillet and here's the kicker.. added Corned Beef Hash into it for a $1 extra! Probably the best thing i have ate at Dennys and not to mention, huge meal.  If you see a pic of a skillet with eggs on top, yeah that'd be me;)  Overall viewing all the other reviews here, the service is good. I wouldn't complain about it not being any better because they are not meant to be a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"I can taste the grease in everyrhing.  The servers are never consistent and you have to be lucky to get an experienced one.  I don't like how there is noiise cancelation, super loud place."}
{"text":"Very busy Dennys! Placed our order and recieved our food within 10 minutes! that's what got them the extra star.   Impressive, although had some dirt in my ice."}
{"text":"On May 17 I had a horrible experience here called corporate made a complaint was told three times I would get a call back today I finally called the local chain office back and someone finally returned my call. Perry Morgan the supposed district manager spoke to me and basically said he saw the video of his employee Martha poking at the waffle that was burned and not edible and he was not concerned at all he was like well she got you another right ? What kind of establishment pokes people's food to argue about the level of of a waffle being cooked to? Denny's does."}
{"text":"I went in around 11pm. I ordered a slamburger and fries. The egg on the burger was overcooked. The fries are why they get 1 star. They were barely warm. Must have been cooked 10 minutes before I ordered. Manager gave me 25% off the check and a bunch of lame excuses. I don't give a crap if you're busy. Don't give me garbage and expect me to eat it."}
{"text":"Love the burgers here!!!! and its open late   they need to open more dennys in toronto for us late night birds btw there is free wifi!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying, I have never had high expectations of Denny's late at night.  Stopped by here on a Sunday night at 9:30.  Looked inside before proceeding in to be sure it wasn't busy and it wasn't.  Server approached us right away and we were seated.  We ordered our food and had drinks pretty quickly.  About 70 minutes later our food started showing up.  The dinner salad was horrible (mostly grated cheese).  How do you mess up a dinner salad?  We should've left right then.  The meals started showing up about 20 minutes later and they were COLD.  No one ever apologized for the wait and they came by to clear the plates, no on asked us how it was or if we were done.  We barely even touched the food.  I have now sworn off all Denny's for late night."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this location again. First I was surprised when we were being seated that the host didn't bring kids menus when you can clearly see we have two young kids. Then I ask for kids menus and the girl said \"ok I'll be right back\". I literally watched her go back up front and start seating other people. Never brought the menus. The waitress was really nice and got us our drinks quickly. We order, then the food comes out almost 30 minutes later. Mine and my two year olds meals were messed up. Waitress says \"ok I'll fix this\" and never did. Had to take a few minutes to pick egg shells out of our food.... asked the waitress for a box. Boxes never came. I eventually just got up and went to the front and asked if I could pay cause no one brought us the bill. The girl at the front with her snobby attitude says \"umm I can just print it out for you\" printed off my check and then walked away and made someone else finish it. Worst service I have literally ever had in my life and I highly recommended no one go to this Denny's. Go to the one in Sun City, they care about their customers."}
{"text":"Some previous reviews painted a bad picture but we tried it anyway and the service was great as was the food. One of the best Dennys experiences in a long while."}
{"text":"This Denny's is not your mother's Denny's.   Great bar and a fun place to go downtown Las Vegas.   The beer was great and the specials were tasty."}
{"text":"I have visited this Denny's many times. Breakfast has always been good with very good workers. The dinner time is another story. It seemed that the people who work evenings do not care about doing a good job. Orders would get messed up, items which should have been on the plate were missing. One time, my family and I walked out because our order somehow got lost in the kitchen. The waiter was too dumb to realize why many patrons, who had their order taken after ours, had already finished their meals and ours was nowhere in sight. The waiter was impossible to get his attention. I would rather eat at Burger King fior dinner than go here again. Again, this is not directed to the breakfast times."}
{"text":"This place had the best staff ever. I go here all the time and I cant stress enough how much fun I have here. Customers seem to know the managers and the servers by name. Its more like a family than it is a restaurant. Way to go!"}
{"text":"As were checking out Las Vegas Strip, I was soooo hungry. I decided to go for Old Faithful Breakfast. Who can go wrong with Denny's. Let me start off by saying Our Male Server was Great. He actually remembered us from visiting before...Wow Right. Got 2 OJ'a right away.  I ordered the Sticky Bun Pancakes And Bacon Extra Crispy. Mouth was watering awaiting these Pancakes. John ordered the Orange Cranberry Pancakes with Sunny Side Up Eggs, Bacon & Sausage.  As we waited for our food, we planned our day laughing like some teenage couple. Oh, we're still young  Breakfast came and it was cold. Bacon iced cold.I was so disappointed. Not what I was use too. I'm assuming it sat under the window awaiting a pickup. I promised in advance not to complain. But it was like eating cold cornbread with syrup. After seeing my expressions, John informed our server of my food. He was very apologetic and he gave us a discount.  I left with only having a very small portion of breakfast. Needles to say, we won't be visiting again while in L.V."}
{"text":"Yep.  That sure is Denny's.  Look - I'm not saying it's terrible, because two stars just means I've had better.  And I have.  I've had better and cheaper breakfasts all over the city, but that doesn't mean that Denny's isn't for me.  There's something charming about knowing that next time you're at Yonge and Dundas Square at 3 in the morning, and you need to wait for the subway to come back to life at 6am, there's a place for you.  And that place is Denny's.  The charm is that it's always there, always open, and ready to give you a grand slam.  Also - it's worth mentioning that their pancakes are great value.  Nothing else is - you'll leave hungry, because - Denny's...  Maybe more than four french fries on the side of that small sandwich that cost 10 bucks next time?  But man... Their pancakes are what I always want.  One of the few places I'll actually pay money for pancakes.  Go check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Been to a lot of Denny's and this is easily the worst of them all.  The biggest beef was seeing our food waiting for easily 10 minutes under the warmer before being delivered to us. The service was slow even though the restaurant was nearly empty. The food was luke warm (no surprise sitting under the warmers), pancakes were crusty on top (no surprise sitting under the warmers), waitress never refilled drinks, and we had to ask for the bill. Overall disappointing experience. I'll be happy to get back my favorite Denny's in San Jose, CA."}
{"text":"If I can give it a no star a no star they will get! Very slow we just left the menus at the table cause we were there for 10-15mins and no one took our drink order. If they ain't going to serve Close that Denny's. Or get new management"}
{"text":"I just experienced the worst visit to a Denny's in my life. Not only was our food ridiculously late, missing utensils, and ZERO drinks after waiting an hour, we were then made to feel like it's our fault because he's (Kevin, the manager) is busy that day. I've worked in the restaurant industry and that was the most trash visit I have every experienced in my life. I'm completely upset. Never going to Denny's again. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"It's Denny's so what can I say? It's fine. It's not great but you know what you're getting when you go to Denny's. If you've never been to Denny's then crawl out from your rock (jk) and go. The food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable. The service is mediocre but our server was hustling and I appreciated it. I didn't really enjoy my hash browns b/c they seemed under-cooked to me.  Do I recommend Denny's? Not really but I still go once a year b/c they're reliable and conveniently located."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER with MAJOR bad attitudes  prob because they had to work on Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak cobb salad.  The place was mostly empty and it still took over half an hour for the salad to arrive. Everyone else, including people that arrived after us, were served first.  Then the salad looked like a bomb hit it.  the portions were smaller than advertised and it looked like a hot mess.  The best we got was a lame \"sorry\" from the waitress. Denny's is ok for the free grand slam on your birthday, but other than that, its best to stay clear of their overpriced menu accompanied by lousy service and misrepresentation between what is described on the menu and what actually arrives on your plate."}
{"text":"Just keep driving and hit up IHOP, it's literally 30 seconds away from this Denny's.  I am actually a Denny's fan. When I am in the mood for something that is full of calories and eggs that are stuffed with meat and cheese, Denny's is a good place to come. It's great for eating after you've been drinking and it's good for a breakfast, just because you want to have a huge Grand Slam breakfast.  Unfortunately this Denny's is really sub-par, and I know, I know - it's Denny's! But still. The place is always super crowded and the waiters always seem on the verge of having mental break downs. They often forget items or don't have the food brought out correctly (ie: my boyfriend always orders things without onions and here they always manage to leave them on).   Plus, I think Denny's is over-pricing its food now-a-days. Unless you go for their specials such as the breakfast slams you might as well go eat somewhere else and get better food for a better price. I paid $9.99 for an \"okay\" buffalo chicken sandwich. When I pay almost $10 for a sandwich, I want it to be spectacular.   Just not worth it."}
{"text":"Service was good, but the food portions were yet to be desired. I ordered the super bird sandwich and let me tell you. The bird wasn't super. I was wondering if they forgot to put the rest of the turkey on my sandwich. The sandwich looked sick instead of super. The portion of fries not quite there. I have been to other Denny's and got more than my money's worth. This one on Watson and Yuma . Not worth my money. And I'm still hungry.. If your going to stop at Denny's please stop at the one on 75th Ave and McDowell road. At least there I get the portions I'm paying for.."}
{"text":"OK so in the past Dennys would be my last choice for a meal but due to them seeming to.lead the pack when it comes to gluten free options and the way they are doing there menu which clearly identifies gf choices.  Also now offering gluten free english muffin.  KUDOS DENNYS************"}
{"text":"By far, the worst dining experience I have had. I've been to this location on a couple occasions. While they weren't 5 star, the past experiences weren't  bad enough to stop me from coming back. Until now. My friends and I were just looking for a late night snack. We were seated in a timely manner, however the waitress took 20 minutes to acknowledge us, took our drink order and failed to get that right. 20 minute later, she came back to take our order. Our food arrived 30 minutes later and was dissatisfying. Some of our plates were either over cooked or under cooked and all the waitress could say is, there's new cooks back there. They were completely understaffed and by the time we left, it was a mad house. I do not recommend this location due to slow service, careless service and a lack of a clean environment. (Location: 99th Ave and Camelback)"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes when it was empty only to be told, \"Sit where you want if you still want to eat here.\" Food was room temperature. Toast had mold on it. Worst Denny's ever!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Horrible service when there was only one other party in the place. Actually, we never got waited on, but we got to watch the 3 employees behind the counter chat it up all the while looking at us and knowing we weren't being helped. It was like they were playing rock, paper, sicssors  to see who was going to get stuck waiting on us. Got up and left, got in our car and as we were pulling out some guy flagged us down and said he was the manager and apologized for the crappy non service which he wouldn't have had to do if he was managing his employees. If you want to be ignored and treated horribly, this is the place for you. Otherwise, go up the street to IHOP."}
{"text":"It's ice cold in this place. Be sure to wear your winter coat and ear muffs...the coldness makes absolutely no sense!"}
{"text":"The service sucks waited was to long for the food got half the food and was done before the rest came out to me"}
{"text":"Is this Denny's new? I don't remember it being here last year. It's very clean and seems that way. Our host, server and manager were extremely friendly.  This one is unique with its offerings of tvs and full bar; I'm wondering if the menu is the same nationwide.  I don't know how long it's been since I've dined at a Denny's in IL; I've never seen meatball lasagna on the menu. I've been on a meatball sandwich binge lately (no wonder I'm not losing weight); so naturally, I had to order the lasagna. It came with 2 slices of garlic bread.  It's filled with plentiful layers of meatballs, pasta, sauce and cheese. Heavy and filling, I finished 1/3 of my plate. No place for a microwave to heat it so I'm sad to admit the rest was wasted. My only hope now is to go to a neighborhood Denny's and find it on our menu."}
{"text":"This is a reasonable Denny's and my husband likes to go here.  We usually get good service, but periodically not.  The food is typical and nothing out of the ordinary.  My husband does love their Lumberjack breakfast, which is a lot of food.  It's easier to go here to eat rather than make all this stuff, which I did once.    Anyway, it's fine.  No real stand out complaints but no real stand out praises either.  It's convenient and periodically we will eat here, maybe 2-3 times a year."}
{"text":"First time for me at a Denny's. I am a breakfast FAN so I cannot comment on other items on the menu. WHAT a bargain: got the value menu I think called a slam. Two eggs (anyway you want) two pieces of bacon or sausages and two pancakes for $4.  I really liked the pancakes!!!! Excellent meal!   I drink water so where can you get breakfast for $4 + tax+ tip?  Will be back."}
{"text":"Food was on point, so good.. The waitress was very respectful and nice brought our food out hot and ready to eat, kept on checking to make sure we had everything that we needed. Will be returning"}
{"text":"This Denny's is the best looking,friendly,and cleanest I have ever been in,there is a bar with about four flat screen TV. tables and stools that seats about 20 to 25 people,the deco in the bar area is very stylish,also they serve there frozen drinks too this is strange they have a place inside that says photo booth that you can take pictures, outside I can see but inside I don't see,try the blooded mary garnish with celery /lime and strip of bacon and side car of horse relish $6,00 so forget the food come here for the bar,its also a great place to people watch with an enclosed patio,I did eat breakfast here before I hit 15 SB"}
{"text":"We were very impressed and satisfied with our visit to this Denny's. Upon arrival we were quickly greeted and seated. Our waitress appeared and quickly took our drink order. She was very nice, friendly and took out order without a long wait. Our food arrived in a timely manner and was prepared to order. Unlike some restaurants our food did NOT sit under heat lamps and arrived at our table hot and immediately after being prepared in the kitchen. Our waitress was quiet efficient and tended to our needs without being intrusive. Over all this Denny's has excellent customer service and very good food."}
{"text":"Do not eat here even if you are at risk of dying from starvation. I made the poor decision to try and eat what this establishment calls \"food\" because other breakfast spots were on a wait on a Sunday morning. Here is my review:  * Facility: the condition of the restaurant was abysmal. Sticky floors and an unpleasant odor greeted me as soon as I entered and never left.  * Service: it was apparent that the staff here either didn't know or didn't care what customer service is. From host stand to table, I had to actively seek out assistance rather than be guided, and the experience felt haphazard and disjointed, with poor communication between staff. They also had very loud personal conversations and vulgarities were audible.  * Food: everything was undercooked, cold, and bland. Some items we ordered, such as biscuits and grits, were downright inedible. The lingering tasteless plastic taste was pervasive through every item ordered.  In summary, avoid this place at all costs. The only things going for it are fast seating and cheap price, but you would be better off buying food from a gas station in my experience here."}
{"text":"Food was decent. The lines here in the morning get insanely long. What made them get the 4 stars was the 2 for one bloody Mary's and mimosa's in the front haha. Great idea!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place since we arrived to AZ 4 years ago. Cozy, delicious, with WIFI for the kid and look for the online discounts!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location for breakfast using a BOGO coupon.  It was located in the Fiesta Rancho Casino in Las Vegas.  It took a few minutes to be seated.   I ordered the Santa Fe Skillet and my friend ordered the Senior Fit breakfast.  The food came out fairly fast.  We went to the cash register to pay.  Again, it took a few minutes for someone to come up front."}
{"text":"If I can give them 0 stars I would but unfortunately I can't. I got this email for 20% off dine in as you can see I got it March 23rd and the coupon expired March 11.... so we call the Denny's and asked about it and the manager told us she would honor it even thought it was on my phone and it says to print it. We go dine in and Katrice(she told us her name was) denied us the coupon because it wasn't printed out when her boss confirmed to us that she would honor it just to get people to come in. The service was terrible, waited almost 30 mins for our food. Not only that but when we've ordered take out they ALWAYS forget something. And to top this off she keep coughing and DID NOT wash her hands giving us our change."}
{"text":"This place was a total joke!! The customer service sucked. It seemed our server would've rather been out getting a root canal than being there! The cooks can't cook. They never asked how my daughter wanted her burger and when she got it it was burnt. The server said that's how dennys makes burgers! The food tasted so bad I ended up running to the bathroom and vomited for 5 min! We complained to the manager and she was BS! She ended up comping the meal! That was the best part of the night! I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT DENNYS EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes and then had cold food delivered to our table. They forgot my sons apples to accompany his meal, and they got my order wrong altogether. Server visited our table twice. No drink refills until the end of our meal when we had to ask. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"So I took my Wife to Denny's for her free birthday grand slam. I even called ahead to make sure there were no fine print issues like we've had before with this location. Waitress on the phone even suggested separate checks so that I could use my 15% AARP discount. Glad I printed out the AARP page regarding the discount because in the past this location scammed us over restricted hours when in fact AARP clearly states: \"Save 15% on your entire check all day, every day.\" . The AARP Arrived and the first thing that happens is our waitress starts giving us a hard time over the arrangement. She starts arguing about the 15% AARP printout that I showed her. She argued I could not use the AARP card with the \"coupon\". I kept telling her its not a coupon ... its the AARP printout page. She finally understood after a few minutes of arguing. Meals were fine. My 15% checkout went sort of smoothly. Then my Wife went up to settle her bill for the taxes still due on the free meal and then all hell broke loose. She was told that she was to have made a beverage purchase in order to qualify for the free meal so no free meal. I told them that I will give them the appropriate negative reviews on Yelp and Trip Adviser. \"Go ahead\" yelled the manager. She finally apologized to my Wife but both us got sick later over the stress of dealing with what I like to call \"trailer trash customer service\". This wrecked my Wife's birthday. Do you see anywhere in the Denny's advert about having to buy a beverage? \"FREE ORIGINAL GRAND SLAM ON YOUR BIRTHDAY! That's right, drop by any Denny's Restaurant and we'll treat you to A FREE Grand Slam on your birthday! Valid ID must be presented. Not valid with any other coupon or promotional offer. Taxes and gratuity extra. Not valid for alcohol. Available at participating restaurants. 2005, DFO, Inc.\" And there are no restrictions that we get separate bills ... but this location made us feel like that really is not allowed. So in other words you go with a friend and go dutch and separate bills are not permitted. Welcome to Dennys Grand Slam Scam.  We will never go back to this location. But judging from the bad reviews at other locations Denny's has a serious upper management problem."}
{"text":"I don't think anyone should go here unless you're drunk ! That's when everything tastes good . I've been to Denny's before and it didn't taste anything like this . The orange juice was bitter , the pancakes were cold and the strips of bacon were so skinny I was scared to eat it . So basically they got one star because 0 wasn't an option ."}
{"text":"A star is not even what i wanted to write for this dennys, it deserves absolutely no stars what so ever. I came here with my family, and the service was terrible, took the waiter forever to actually attend us. The food wasn't good at all, the fries were all burned and cold. When we went to go pay for the meals the associate named \"Maria\" literally slammed the scanner on the table after we gave her a coupon. Rolling her eyes the entire time, extremely terrible. I recommend everyone to just pass on this location, definitely never coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible dennys. Made me realize why i never go there anymore. Took 20 min for drink order to be taken. My daughters food was done and just sat on counter while the rest was finished had to ask for hers so it didnt get cold. Mediocre at best. Took an additional 20 min to get check and bag for take out. Just really bad experience"}
{"text":"This has absolutely nothing to do with bad service, or even expectations about the food. It's a Denny's.   Had a work breakfast meeting here last month.   Case of the Mondays, meet MSG induced food poisoning. Can you guess where this review is going?  My boss got pretty sick. So did my coworker. Who knows how many others did. I know I did. Blowing out both ends . . . Ain't nobody got time for that!   Never again!"}
{"text":"I couldn't figure out how a Denny's could have a 2-Star rating. Now I understand. AVOID. We were in town for a football game, and we're extremely disappointed in the service, food, and sanitary conditions at this Denny's location. Dirty plates from the previous customer sat on our table for 20+ minutes and remained there after our order was taken. They were out of bacon and sausage. (It was about 1/2 full). Staff was extremely rude and incompetent. Line cooks were wiping noses, touching hair, and not replacing gloves after touching computer screens and mopping. I hope that this review saves a fellow breakfast-seeker from a very poor experience!"}
{"text":"Whether it is your local dine in restaurant like Denny's where it's an array of the general public or a classy fine diner where there is a dress code, service etiquette is the most important aspect.   The gentlemen that served me was everything a waiter should not be: Never once asked how the coffee was, checked to see how the food was (after he so conveniently walked up as I sat down and said you are going to have to wait awhile, no greeting before the rude message), seemed as it's the last place on earth he wanted to be (told the table next to me how unhappy he was) and kept calling me \"bro\".   First impression and couldn't be more disappointed. Never again."}
{"text":"I am in no hurry to return. I know many people who eat here. I often hear good things. I on the other hand wasn't impressed with my meal. I would have preferred to stay home although the manager did voluntarily accomodate me for my dissatisfaction. The restaurant was clean and seemed to have a lot of regulars. I was greeted and seated fairly quickly."}
{"text":"It's Denny's. It's not exactly the greatest restaurant so for anyone to have high standards is nuts. The food is good, but I never like to get steak and mashed potatoes. It's always too small. If you're only moderately hungry then it'll fill you. Denny's is good for sandwiches like the philly cheese steak and breakfast. The customer service was excellent. The first time we came here, there was a waiter that talked and had similar look to Justin Long, really great customer service skills. Had Michael last night as a waiter, also terrfic."}
{"text":"Had a very good day. My last stop to get my Birthday meal, thanks to the staff for accommodating my request. You guy's rock"}
{"text":"This Denny's seriously have the most awesome staff! My family and I come to Vegas a lot. My sisters son has major food allergies and it is always a challenge when we go out to eat trying to figure out what he can eat and what not. The Manager Bryson & our waitress Toni were so completely amazing! As an aunt it really warms my heart to see people be so accommodating to my nephew because for one I know it can be frustrating and time consuming at times. Especially when you're in Vegas! But not once did Bryson or Toni make us feel any different and definitely were very helpful! We will definitely come back to this Denny's when we are back!"}
{"text":"Denny's is not that exciting but I've got to say this location has a great set up for take out. We were traveling with our dog and didn't want to crate her to go get dinner and we didn't have a car so our options were limited. We walked over and ordered at Denny's. Our order was prepared quickly and accurately and packaged in special togo containers that prevented the crispy stuff from getting soggy."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch! Usually come here when we get sow vouchers in the mail. I got the breakfast eggs and potatoes with a steak kabob and a cheese quesadilla for $2.  It was alright but the meat on the Kabob was tough and chewy. I really want to try their pancakes- I hear they are even fluffier now!"}
{"text":"my service was very HORRIBLE! they took way too long, about more than 30 minutes for our food and honestly, the food was already cold when it arrived to my table, totally unacceptable, i would give it 0 stars if i can, worst denny's ever !!!"}
{"text":"Rating is based on my overall Denny's and Denny-Like experiences - not comparing it to other restaurants. The staff here is friendly and polite and attentive. Denny's is comfort food at it's best. AND pancakes, waffles, and breakfast foods! If you're traveling the Beeline, staying/living/passing through Fountain Hills, this is a great stop no matter what meal you're around for."}
{"text":"Today i had the most horrible experience at this place . I had ordered the french toast and found a string of hair in my toast , so i told the server and he looks at and replies with an attitude \"my chef is bald\" . The manager never came by to talk to me or to make sure everything was okay. Managers name is Jose ! Absolutely horrible !!!!"}
{"text":"Great Denny's location. They have a full bar AND a wedding chapel. Yeah you heard me right....a wedding chapel. I only know because the manager and I came up to our table and told us after our hangover breakfast that we could go get hitched in the back. Super clean with friendly staff. Hot food."}
{"text":"Our servers Tracy was HORRIBLE, it took her forever to take our order...Other than that the food was good.."}
{"text":"This is probably the nasty Denny's I have been to the bathrooms where dirty. The window I was sitting next to had a nasty died cockroach. I couldn't even enjoy my food. I just kept thinking what if a cockroach was in my food ugh!! When I got my check I asked Mo if he could let me talk to the manger, she was kind enough to give me 40% off on my bill. But still my stomach isn't sitting well with the food I ate.."}
{"text":"Very nice staff food was not bad . I took my girls for the free grand slam .The staff was very friendly ."}
{"text":"For starters, this place has a very strong moldy smell to it. From looking at the old stained carpets, this seems where it may be comming from.  Next, I ordered a soda and my glass was dirty and had oily stains from it.  I've been to other Denny's Resturants, but this by far is the dirtiest establishment I've been to.  I was afraid to try the food, fearing that the Kitchen (shielded from view) would be worse than what customers are able to see.  I would recommend someone inspect the air quality and cleaniness of this establishment."}
{"text":"Great, delicious, and inexpensive. Not fine dining, but pretty good food at a pretty good price."}
{"text":"The worst customer service! I came for a late bite around 2am. The restaurant had a few patrons, from what I could see, but it wasn't bustling by no means. I waited to be seated about 7 or so minutes and no hostess came to greet me and 3 other parties already waiting. I had to approach the kitchen to ask if someone will come to seat us but I was told to go back and wait another 10-15 mins, I did reluctantly. As I waited and waited I notice the staff were running all over the place. There was a lot of action but no one was getting served! It was total chaos! After about 20 mins and a few walkouts I too walked away hungry and disappointed. This location has closed and reopened multiple times. Most businesses do not get second and third chances. One would think the franchise would do something about preserving their reputation.   Don't bother coming here. Just go to the McD's across the way if you need a late night meal. It will save you from horrible service."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas and need some inexpensive midnight food.  The wait staff was marginal but the food was on par with any other Denny's nation-wide."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast brunch lunch or any time of day. The kids menu is nothing short of amazing! My kids had pancakes, one had chocolate chip the other birthday cake. Less than $5 each! They also got birthday cake shakes! Talk about delicious. My hubby had a lumberjack, I had the all American. Everything was perfect except my scrambled eggs were a little over cooked, and it took quite a while to get the milkshakes. Hence the 4 star rating. Both understandable, as it was super busy. I'll be back again, and I'm sure my kids will be begging to come back again."}
{"text":"Great service, the server was very friendly and made appropriate suggestions.    The server suggested the healthy pancakes, we tried it but it wasn't good, kind of dry.  The sausages were kind of dry and not warm enough.  The fruits that came with the meal were also skimpy, a bit of grapes and cantaloupe.  The french toast on the other hand was very good!  I would come back if I'm in the area.  I've been to other locations of Denny's and have never been disappointed.  I was not disappointed this time either, I would still come back because I really think it was a one-off."}
{"text":"Worse dennys ever.   No consistency..food is never cooked right.  Half the staff is rude as f.   I normally tip fat.  Not here.  Very annoying.  Go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"I like Denny's for breakfast, that right, I like it especially on my birthday HA!  3 stars is A-OK in my book, I really like the coffee and this location isn't the nicest that I have been to but the service is always good here and you cant really screw up breakfast.  I enjoy the grand slam now that you can get it your way, I just get the eggs, sausage, oatmeal, & wheat pancakes are pretty darn good.  I do wish they had cottage cheese but that is a personal preference really.  I just like to read the newspaper and have a meal here during the week since my office is nearby, of course the food always comes out so quick that I usually have to do both at the same time but I am not complaining."}
{"text":"I went here one time and will never go back. First of all there was a weird odor as soon as you enter, that should have been a clue. They wrote our name down on the waiting list. After having waited for 30 minutes  we noticed they had seated a party that came in after us. When we asked why they said that the other party had their own waiter. I don't know what that means. We told the management that their poor service cost them two customers. Save yourself the hassle and go to the waffle house next door. They know how to treat customers."}
{"text":"Love Denny's but this one isn't that great! They always miss bringing me something I ordered and most the time my sons food is cold smh  Tonight I ordered a side of gravy MORE THAN 3 TIMES and still didn't get it!!!  I only come here because it's the closes to the house.  Under staffed and they don't pay attention!"}
{"text":"0 stars!!!! It wasn't even busy yet completely INVISIBLE to the ENTIRE wait staff! Literally had to walk up to the counter and to get water for my entire table. Then 30 mins later when food finally came out, not only was it cold, but completely WRONG. How the hell do you forget toast. And server gives us our food as if we were burdening her. Absolutely ridiculous. And when we asked to talk to a manager the only thing he was concerned with was whether we were paying separately. I don't care how drunk or hungry you are, this is Vegas. There are soooo many other places you can get food other than this dump!"}
{"text":"I rarely ever have a bad experience with this Denny's. The waiters are always there to refill your drinks and your food comes out shortly after you order. Occasionally I have gotten greasy food that was not as good as the times before (and after), but that is not common for this location. My favorite waiter is Lisa. She is very friendly and talkative, and she is great at remembering what you regularly order. Overall this is an excellent place to get food, especially if you want a quick bite for a low price."}
{"text":"Great location. The staff is super friendly. Food is great as always.   At the end of my meal the manager came over and handed me a coupon for a free appetizer to use on my next visit. She also said they take competitor's coupons which is absolutely awesome.   My server got a special anniversary delivery during my meal and everyone around was soo happy for him.   This is really a family location. Everyone is just so friendly. I'll definitely be back! IHOP rocks!"}
{"text":"i actually like this dennys and come here every time im in vegas wanting breakfast.  they are ALWAYS BUSY. but dont be fooled. when they say 20 mins is the wait for your table they mean 20 or less.. which is cool since they have a crowd inside and outside waiting to be seated.  service is good. food is good, better then other dennys that i have been too.  open late for them late night munchies.   -if you have to wait for your table and its uber hot out.. go next door to the abc store to just chill in their a/c and \"look\" around. why not free a/c while waiting to get seated. =]  enjoy"}
{"text":"After driving down from Toronto early in the morning in which I decided to skip breakfast.. I saw this Denny's near the casino and falls. We decided to get some grub and it's your standard breakfast fare. Nothing special about it. The service was meh. The portions to price ratio wasn't good. What we got wasn't worth what we paid. Maybe it was because we were in a very touristy location? I don't know. Wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Omg  That was the worst service ever. Diane came and took my husband order and my daughter's but did not take mine. I said ok i would like, Oh that is right.Then I had to ask another server for coffee and she kept for getting my daughter's Mashpoatoes  and corn she needs to hang up her apron now.."}
{"text":"This Denny's is terrible. I visited two times and it got progressively worse. Saturday night at 11pm I came here with my boyfriend because we were hungry. The waitress took our order. We waited 40mins and no food came out.  The restaurant wasn't packed and Several patrons left. Eventually the staff stopped taking orders and started turning people away. We left and are not coming back."}
{"text":"American grand slam worst ever. Rubber bacon,smallest link sausage I ever saw. Eggs cold English muffin not toasted beverages not kept full.   No silverware no napkins ,bathrooms were not clean.   Seriously nobody had it together. I should have went to another place and waited but I fasted for a blood test.   The water was good when we got it.   So darn expensive for so little food. Dirty place do not suggest eating here anytime soon.   Probably the last time I go to Denny's.   My wife's food was spicy and bacon was rubbery as well. Granddaughter didn't like her nuggets. Sad very sad. Oh p.s a whopping 34 bucks for such a horrible meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Denny's (ever!) and although it was satisfying... compared to IHOP, it was average. I had the Banana Bread French Toast with sunny side-up eggs, bacon and hash brown while my mom ordered the Blueberry pancakes with scrambled eggs, sausages and hash brown. The French toast was a little bit on the dry and bland side (although I didn't add any syrup on it) but the glazed pecans that came with it were good. I loved the hash brown especially because it was a pretty good size portion that was served with the meal (compared to the picture in the menu). The blueberry pancakes my mom had were pretty good--- fluffy and sweet on its own that it didn't need any maple syrup. The cream cheese icing sauce it came with was delicious as well! Overall, for the quick seating, service and satisfying breakfast food, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Comfort food with good price!  Portions are very big ones and taste ia good. Good value 4 money!  Example: Cheesecake was 3$ only!  Price: **** Service: **** Food: ****"}
{"text":"stopped in for a super duper late lunch.   Drove out of the way from the strip because we figured it would be less crowded and we were correct.  Service was ok.  We were seated immediately.  The food was just warm...not piping hot.  WTH.....seems I cant get hot eggs lately. Overall food and service was ok.  Not sure I would make an effort to come back to this location.  But gram and Ms. S were happy because their coffee was piping hot!"}
{"text":"In town for the weekend .. Are they suppose to give you the check right after bringing you the order without even asking you if you're done ?  Anyways not our usual Denny's experience will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Usually love Denny's but this time not so much.. Ordered the steak and eggs. Asked for well done but the meat was still red. My eggs had red spots on them maybe from the blood from the meat. Had to eat around the red eith means I couldn't enjoy my meal or get what I paid to eat"}
{"text":"I came to Denny's after a long night shift. I love that they served everything off their menu at any time of day!! I didn't have to just get breakfast. Because I was not feeling breakfast at all.   The service was good. I was sat right away and waited on in a reasonable time. Although the Cleanliness of my table could have used a wipe down - crumbs on the table.   The food was good - I ordered the half portion of nachos, chicken tacos and fries. The Price is very affordable which I love. The nachos were delicious and half portion was big enough to share. I ate all of it by myself. The chicken tacos I ordered off their value menu. This was something new I hadn't seen the last time I was at Denny's. Take a look at that menu they usually have it sitting on the table. Great deals!!! And I left this place with a stuffed belly and a taco to take home for later."}
{"text":"THANK YOU ALBA, awesome service!!! I love the fact that it's always elderly people at this location and service is so quick. Alba was my waitress today and she was super nice and super fast. She was the only waitress serving 7 tables on an early Friday afternoon. I placed my order and got my food in just a few minutes. My order was perfect. I was in and out in 40 min. Perfect place to go during your lunch time"}
{"text":"Experience: Drank...then hungry.  Went with a friend who was out late with me. Picked this location, because it was close to my house.   Facility:  forgive me, but all I noticed is it was a Denny's. What can I say...I was drinking I told yah.   Service:  our waiter was good and very nice; however when he went on his break, I had to try to flag someone else for a drink refill. Took a while and someone finally came over and gave us refills. Then about 5 min later, our waiter appeared checking if we needed anything. LOL!   Food:  just about anything on the greasy side is good when you're drunk. We shared some fried jalape√±os and cheese quesadillas.  LOVED the jalape√±os!!!! Then I ordered the skillet platter with sausage. I ordered over easy, but they were more like over difficult. I asked to hold the onions and peppers, but add tomatoes. The skillet above on the menu said it was with grape tomatoes, so this is what I expected. It was more like they added stewed tomatoes...could have done without those, otherwise, the skillet hit the spot. Although, I filled up on appetizers, so I ended up taking most of my food home.   Overall: would definitely come back at 2:00am again!"}
{"text":"2 strikes , 3 strikes and we are done.   Went for dinner 530pm March 17th. Ordered the Grilled Salmon Dinner Hubs ordered a sandwich. About 10 minutes later, server came to tell me sorry no Salmon. Really, Manager had to have known this well before 530PM. We went somewhere else for dinner that night.  Went for Lunch March 26 with a friend 1230PM. No Soup, not even the everyday Chicken Noodle .. No soup at 1230PM what kind of manager does not keep track of the kitchen? Friend had the grilled chicken cranberry salad. The chicken was cold and hard unable to eat it.  Ignored when we entered, No one greeted us, we finally sat ourselves service was slow.  The floors were sticky, stains from spilled sodas splashed on the floor and food particles could be seen. My shoes stuck to the floor as we walked.   I may give them another try and let you know if things improve."}
{"text":"Went to Dennys wanted to sit at a breakfast counter, no such thing at this dennys.  Tried the new buttermilk pancakes with fresh fruit on top, the pancakes were tough.  Service was friendly and fast.   The restaurant was fairly busy."}
{"text":"Not really sure where to start with this review. ....nothing great about this Dennys trip. The food was terrible my bacon & sausage smelled and tasted like plastic. Our waiter didn't get the orders right. ..brought out the wrong meal. He spent majority of his time playing on the computer. .I'm just going to leave this review as is. Ugh won't be going to Dennys ever again."}
{"text":"The food here is sub-par and overpriced for what it is compared to the states.  The place is never really clean and the service is never really great.  I have been here a few times, and I think this last time was the last time."}
{"text":"My family and I come here all the time probably almost every Saturday. (As it is affordable even with three brothers) on Saturday mornings it's normally pretty busy but the waitresses no matter who they are work there BUTTS off to get your food to you quickly and keep your drinks filled. Today was the first time we came in the evening. It was surprisingly quiet and not very many people were there. The service was great and the broccoli and cheese soup was better then panera's! The manager came and checked on every table to make sure everything was running smoothly. It was a nice change. I recommend this dennys at any time of the day. Oh and if you're in the mood for ice cream, the banana split is one of the best. But you definitely have to share!"}
{"text":"I needed eggs for breakfast in the middle of my Las Vegas trip (vs. the bread / pastries) and the Gran Slam hit the spot for me.   I arrived just before 7am and it was not crowded.    The server was good but a bit slow despite all the empty tables.   Nevertheless, all's good and I would come back for breakfast any time (vs. go to hotel restaurant at double or triple the price)."}
{"text":"It was a long night of drinking and the last men standing were hungry before taking a hour or two nap and hitting the road. We stopped by Denny's on the vegas strip. We sat down and ordered. I had the moons over my hammy with bacon, tomato and avocado. To drink I had a strawberry lemonade. We also had some mozzarella sticks that were very good. I always enjoy mozzarella sticks. The sandwich was good and did the job and can't forget the season fries with ranch on the side. Denny's after a night of drinking did the job."}
{"text":"It's Dennys so yeah food is always just ok. But the customer service was great. Stopped here to eat on our drive back to San Diego."}
{"text":"We normally enjoy this location. We go on Tuesdays or Saturdays for Kids Eat Free because we honestly can not see spending $40 plus tip for breakfast at a Dennys. We can eat at a fancy place like Abuelos for $45 plus tip. We went in 2 weeks ago on a Tuesday night. Yummy meal except the new chef had no clue how to poach an egg...come on now and AFTER  I paid the bill I realize the did NOT give me the kids eat free. The waitress actually tells me that I have to ASK for it. I am sorry but it advertised on the outside of the building that kids eat free on Tuesdays. I am pretty sure its illegal to tell me I have to ask for it. If not,its very unfair practice. I demanded they refund the amound and re ring up the order. The manager is called and tells me she can not do that. I am sorry but I am a business owner and used to work retail. YES you can refund and re ring the order. When I asked her what she would do to fix it she just tells me to come in anytime and get the kids eat free. I asked her for a coupon or something said this. She just takes my name and says that good enough. We all know that if we go in and she is not there, they will have NO clue what is going on AND how long is she going to keep my name in her pocket. Bad eggs and awful service!  (I mistakenly left this review on another dennys yelp review. It belongs on this one)"}

{"text":"Below average service.  I have had two orders prepared incorrectly here, I have only eaten here three times.  I am not going to keep going back to see if the averages of disorder decline, I think three chances is enough.  The food is no better or worse than another Denny's I have been to.  Believe it or not, the other Denny's is in a much worse neighborhood but has far better service.  The pancakes at Denny's went through an overall a few years back.  If you haven't been to Denny's in a long time then you are in for a treat.  The pancakes went from gross to delicious.  I wouldn't give them a Michelin star, but they are definitely good enough that you don't just chuck them in the trash when you leave."}
{"text":"For over 60 years Denny's has etched their name in the pantheon of great American Diners. With hearty, affordable meals and a menu that covers all bases, they have become a hub for communities all over the country.  It's easy to take Denny's for granted. But a recent stop to the Scottsdale location made me pause and reflect on just how special this bastion of American splendor truly is.   I won't waste your time heaping praise on the meals. If you've ever frequented a Denny's, you know the food is outstanding and rivals many Michelin-rated restaurants. I do however want to opine on the service we received from a special waitress.    I arrived without reservation just after 5pm with a group of nine rowdy boys. Normally, we posses a very pleasant disposition, but after a long day in the sun, we needed speedy service and hot meals on the double. Enter our waitress, Mary.   To say Mary was a consummate professional would be an understatement. She was very much a \"Waitresses Waitress.\" It was clear that she had lead a fascinating and storied life. And while her achievements and accolades were most likely vast, she knew the best way to serve her community was right here in Denny's.   Immediately Mary encouraged us to start with the Zesty Nachos. The suggestion was a bit forward to be honest, I mean we just met the lady. But something told us we could trust her. And we did. To our relief, the nachos had a zest level that would satisfy a salsa dancer. After that, we knew who was in command.   Then came time to order entr√©es.   Right away, the big guns were brought out. \"Lumberjack Slam please!\" my brother said. Then, another Lumberjack was ordered, then another. Did Mary even flinch? Hell no. She took the daunting order in stride, stopping only to offer constructive criticism to the short-order cooks. Moments later, our food arrived. Like Mary, it exceeded our expectations.  But it was the little things that I'll remember most about that evening. Little things like Mary's quick wit and knack for taking a joke and dishing it back tenfold. Or her spot on directions to the restroom - a restroom that saw more than ample foot traffic once the forks dropped. Yes, I could go on but I will just leave it at this.

{"text":"The service here is unorganized. I have Ordered here a couple of times here  and they always mess up my order. Never coming back .thanks Denny's"}
{"text":"WORST dining experience EVER! We have to wait for our food for 50mins before being told that there is only 1 cook in the kitchen because the other two quit (no wonder)!    And the employee are unapologetic. Would never visit it again.   Plus: the interior looks dirty."}
{"text":": short wait, fast service, parking accessible at the back of Dennys,  gets crowded, food alright but cheap, fast service crew, along las vegas blvd next to Walgreens.  Place get packed though so, the earlier you go the better."}
{"text":"Eine kleine als Franchise betrieben Filiale der Denny's Kette. Der gro√üe Vorteil f√ºr G√§ste des gegen√ºberliegenden Hampton Inn, das Familienrestaurant liegt in unmittelbarer Reichweite und es hat 24/7 ge√∂ffnet. Wir hatten am fr√ºhen Abend (18:00) keine Wartezeit auf einen Tisch, die Speisen waren ebenfalls z√ºgig nach der Bestellung am Tisch, wobei ich hier nat√ºrlich sagen muss, dass wir nur Salate hatten, hier ist der Zeitaufwand f√ºr das anbraten des H√ºhnchens eher √ºberschaubar. Die Salate selbst waren gut, frisch, knackig und appetitlich angerichtet.  Die Bedienung hat sich gut um uns gek√ºmmert, obwohl wir nur kleine Gerichte hatten, wurde mehrfach nachgefragt ob wir noch etwas m√∂chten oder br√§uchten bzw. Getr√§nke nachgeschenkt.  F√ºr einen schnellen Imbiss allemal geeignet."}
{"text":"Hostess Alondra was beyond rude. I asked her if we needed to seat ourselves (reasonable question since there were seats available) she ignored me....I asked her several times,, finally she said your name (short & clipped) why couldn't she just be nicer about it? It's her job after all. Waitress was ok Lisa, she wasn't very attentive unfortunately. The food was ok . We're not going back there. My son took us here for breakfast & he works in the food industry also, he left a $2.00 tip if that tells you anything."}
{"text":"was in today for graduation lunch. Had a server named Christina. She was not very pleasant, did not check back to see how we were doing, took over 40 minutes for our food to come out.  She did not smile. Seemed annoyed. Yes, they were busy but try smiling, it goes a long way. I complained to the manager and he offered no discount or any apology for her behavior. She rushed and put our food down and did not ever come back. I saw her at a few other tables but someone who looked like a manager was bringing drinks out for her was already helping her so I don't see why she could not even refill our drinks and help us. Rotten service and rotten server. Rolled her eyes several times as well like she did not want to be there."}
{"text":"It's Denny's, so food is the same all around usually.  I came here at 2am and the waitress was very friendly.  Usually you find ppl that don't care to work there, but our waitress was friendly and personable. Food was actually better than I thought at 2am!"}
{"text":"Sunday was my first time eating at a Denny's in Canada..and I was quite excited.  When we arrived around 12:30PM..it was packed..we waited about 15 minutes for a table. When we finally got seated, we wasted no time.. ordering our drinks and food at one go.  We ordered the lumberjack; club sandwich; appetizer sampler (choices of 3) and oreo milkshake.. boy, was the food disappointing. The ham was so overcooked it was almost impossible to cut with a knife and the portions were incredibly small. The food was just overall not impressive..at least the pancakes were okay (though pretty hard to screw up!).  Throughout the meal, we never got a refill on our coffee..our server was nowhere in sight for the last 45 minutes of our meal and we had to get the manager to look for him so that we could get the bill.   The restaurant is quite large (lots of seating). The container with the jam was completely sticky and a mess and there was no white sugar at the table (other than splenda, etc)."}
{"text":"December 25th 10:00pml it was kind busy but guess what, the service was awesome we got seat right a way, the manager Jesus was our waiter and he took our order as fast we were ready, the food was on our table less than 15 mins. He was a great guy talking to us and asking for how good we like the food, I give 5 stars for everything . Thank you JESUS you are one the best managers in town . GOD BLESS YOU!  MERRY CHRISTMAS!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst food ever.  White trash people you now have another gathering spot besides the greyhound bus terminals. Why eat here please tell me."}
{"text":"I would rather eat a shitty frozen dinner, then ever eat this food."}
{"text":"La peor atencion que e tenido en la vida yo nose por que si los meseros toman o estan enfermos los permiten trabajar y luego se desquitan con sus clientes yo creo que aunque ubiera pedido regalada la conida no era para yan mal atencion ."}
{"text":"Moons over my hammy are the best of any Denny's we have been to. Server was very quick and checked back several times. Food was piping hot when served. (A biggie for me) Wife says the women's restroom was the cleanest she has seen in any Dennys.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"I don't know how you can give Denny's anything less than four stars. It's un-American to do so.   It's really just a Denny's inside the Fiesta! You take all the pro's of going to a Denny's (low prices, ok food, no wait) and then add the fact that it's within walking distance of a place that sells $1 margaritas, and you have a recipe for success. Epic win.   My last visit there was a quick stop to grab some food, and I had an epic craving for greasy, delicious, hot food. Denny's was right there, so I popped in. The wait wasn't too long and I got my food quickly, so I was happy. Plus I only spent like $9, so I was happy with that, too!"}
{"text":"This Dennys is Amazing !! The staff is so friendly and the food comes out so fast , I would recommend this Dennys to anyone"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way back to Los Angeles. The food was delicious, but the service was a little slow. It's understandable when there's only one waitress and many people, however, there was only about 4 families in total, 2 of which were almost done eating."}
{"text":"Management at this Restraunt horrible. I tried ordering a few items today and unfortunately they are out of many items, the waitress very friendly complained to us about all the items they are short of just because the manager fails to order on a timely fashion.- next truck 4 days out.  I've been coming to this Restraunt for the past several years and unfortunately and the past few months I've seen the employees so discourage and mad as they are now about how unorganized the manager is.  A few weekends ago my family and I sat  we order food and waited over a hour while we watched everyone else get the orders, people that just arrived. I complained to the manager which did nothing somewhat avoided us."}
{"text":"Denny's is Denny's.  Foodwise, I could copy and paste the same review to each location.  But it's all about the people and staff that make a difference.  This place is pretty decent. People are nice and you get your food in a good amount of time.  My only beef is when they are busy and you're ready to leave, ya might be waiting a bit to pay your bill.  That's happened to me a few times."}
{"text":"Went here early in the morning and it was pretty good.  The waitress was awesome and very friendly.  I give it three stars because Denny's food is A-Ok.  Nothing amazing.  But I still love this place."}
{"text":"Hey it's Denny's.  I love this place because it's right  next to where I live.  I wouldn't give Denny's 5 stars because it's not the best food in the world, but it's fun food and easy and you know what you're gonna get.   I love their cheap menu they have with the $2, $4, and $6 items.  You can create a huge breakfast for near nothing.  This location is what I'd call an old style Denny's..  I almost said ghetto Denny's, but strangely, the people in there were more normal and just laid back.  This was after going there twice.    The server's reminded me of the old Smitty's restaurant people.  Older and pretty nice."}
{"text":"As always when reviewing a chain I assume readers have a general idea of what they are in for with the food, so I want to make this review location specific.  This location is close to our house so we come here for the occasional weekend breakfast when we don't want to cook or wait until brunch. Every time we visit we have a good experience. The establishment is super clean and we have never had a wait for a table. I like their California skillet which is barely over 500 calories but is very filling! The only downside so far to this restaurant is getting water, as another yelper mentioned. The first time we went I had to ask twice for water and the second time we went our waters were served in very small glasses and despite keeping our coffee filled I had to remind the waiter to bring more water. Overall this is a good, no frills, clean place for breakfast."}
{"text":"He ido 2 veces! 1 a desayunar ...El desayuno m√°s caro de toda mi vida !!!!y otra a almorzar! ...... muy muy mala la hamburguesa y el guacamole s√°ndwich!!! Feo feo ! Muy costoso !"}
{"text":"I find the service at this Denny's on McDowell to be a little better than the others. They are open 24x7 but if you need anything past midnight they do not take calls for pickup orders.  I like the slams for breakfast they have a good amount of options but I almost always end up getting the buttermilk pancakes,eggs over-easy,chicken sausage patty and hash browns. The fish and chips are nice served with wavy fries,garlic bread and tartar sauce. Love the cheddar mashed potatoes and NewYork style cheesecake with caramel drizzle. You can also get a slice of French toast or a stack of pancakes for $2 which is quite reasonable.  Denny's is great for a bite if you're feeling too lazy to get dressed and go to some fancy schmancy restaurant.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"You will get value meals.  Unhealthy as in all American Restaurants, but if you don't eat burgers and fries on a daily basis, it will not harm you."}
{"text":"I love breakfast food. Which is why I end up at Denny's so often. I'm not really big on chains and growing up I never liked Denny's, and I have even gotten an upset stomach from going to certain Denny's. This Denny's is the best one I have been to however. Their food is always fresh and fast, the service is always great, and I have never felt at all sick after eating here."}
{"text":"The service is great, even though we ordered online and they missed placing our order. They quickly fixed the problem and we were given complementary beverages for misplacing the order. Really nice place to get fueled up the morning."}
{"text":"Sad to leave this review but this location is out of control. Servers are stretched and understaffed. My food took roughly one hour. Mimosas are tiny compared to the menu and other guests where loud and disrupting everyone else. I love Dennys but this location is bellow the rest."}
{"text":"the waiting is soo freaking long...but on the upside, what do you expect for a lot of cheap great food?"}
{"text":"I have been here now for 42 minutes, yes, I'm timing it! It took 13 minutes to get a top off on my first cup of coffee! This place is not close to being busy, by normal breakfast standards. Got my food, or at least most of it, still waiting on my pancakes, and my server ghosted me! The manager had to refill my coffee, did I mention the server ghosted me? Did I mention that this place is empty? What a joke! Asked for my pancakes twice. Still haven't seen my server since our first interaction. Did I mention it's f'n dead in here? I will say this, the food is good, exactly what I expect from breakfast, eggs were perfect, hash browns were crispy, pancakes fluffy! Service? Not so much! In a hospitality town like Vegas, should have been better! In closing, I will be back, just not to this location! As a restaurant manager for more than 30 years, I'm beyond let down! I know the labor market is tough, but this is where the manager should step in and not only insure a good experience, but work with server and train to them!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place. Pricing just right and the staff is friendly. Great food too. Will surely come again. Thanks Denny's this location has things going right."}
{"text":"Went to Denny's three customers and nobody to greet us no cooks and the waiter or waitress nobody five minutes walk out the door it was vacant Now I see why businesses bad"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy my food at any Denny's... except here.. the waitress was very friendly... they are short staffed. The wait for my food was over an hour and some of it was cold."}
{"text":"WHAT A DIFFERENCE YOUR STAFF MAKES! What happend to the cute girl in the front? After being interrupted several times for my phone order as to my surprise the older woman on the phone read it back correct. Although when i picked up my food there was a hoard of people waiting too be seated, a pizza hut delivery guy waiting to drop of their food, and myself. The people standing to be seated were greeted and seated leaving my self staring at my yummy food getting cold and the delivery guy wondering if he was going to get yelled at by the next customer for taking too long. About ten minutes later a girl from the back came out got her pizza and finally relieved the delivery guy of waiting and several minutes after that i was finally greeted and given my food. The woman in the front asked me to check the order to make sure it was correct. Well my prime rib skillet i carb consciously chose (seeing that my hubby eats the hash browns) ended up being there fully loaded potato prime rib skillet. Simple mistake that is easily forgiven except i was not short of being called a liar about what i ordered instead of them fixing their mistake And then she told me i should ve ordered that because it is cheaper. My Slam burger was smashed and the egg was broken leaving my burger bun soggy and when i asked them to fix it they told me i should ve ordered the egg differently than sunny side up like in the picture (yet i never had this problem before). After she couldn't convince me that i wanted more carb filled potatoes and a soggy burger they took my food and replaced it with what i had asked for. I apologized for the inconvenience I BROUGHT THEM and told them the other to-go containers were much better and perhaps that was the reason the egg broke....she then told me they never had different containers and she didn't know what i was talking about and after getting my food from the cook apologized that they could no longer afford the other containers offered me her card and a free entree WOW!!!!!Upon be completely insulted and lied to i told her to keep the card because i will not return there again.  When will people learn honesty is the best policy and just because someone walks in your place young and in sweats it doesn't mean they are an idiot or less of a person!!!!!! THATS WHY I ORDERED MY FOOD TO GO duh!"}
{"text":"Krystal was pretty cool i guess... she did forget my appetizer but was apologetic and compensating....my food was ok but i got a message from a fellow yelper to give this place another try ..the a.c. was on so i wasnt dying in sweat and after my expeirience today i might go back maybe........."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by this location because it was close, although we have never actually been here before. We came around 6 at night and the place was pretty busy, the man who sat us seemed very rushed. It seems as if they were very understaffed.   That being said, the place was clean and our waitress, Eleanor, came right away and was very attentive. We ordered a half order of the Zesty Nachos, a Dulce de Leche Crunch pancake breakfast with hashbrows, eggs and bacon, and Country Fried Steak and Eggs with pancakes instead of toast. Everything came out fast, hot and delicious. I especially loved the nachos because they used a white queso and a chili, sooo good! And I want to give another shout out to our awesome waitress Eleanor! We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"So I came here for breakfast and my goodness the service was beyond bad. I tried to be cool about it because she was a tad older but she seriously needed a coffee or monster something. She took forever bringing our drinks, then handed us the wrong ones, brought our food a long while later and my food was ice cold, and again passed our plates out to the wrong ones, she literally even told us she works 2 Dennys and was tired, um ok so if you're too tired to work then call in cause you weren't doing any of the customers any favors. Such a bad experience."}
{"text":"Who hasn't been to Denny's we all know what to expect however, this one is clean, friendly, food is hot and quick! Waitress was nice, restrooms are clean.... I'd come back"}
{"text":"I wrote a review but for some reason it did not post.... So anyways, I wouldn't go here again. My husband wanted to take us out for breakfast and thought Denny's would be a good idea. Wasn't too busy and we had a big day ahead of us so why not!?  We get there and it took the hostess 15 minutes to find a clean table to sit us at and then almost had our table stolen when the people behind us was getting seated. Not exactly their fault and we did still get our table so whatever right...  We sit down (me, my husband and my son) and it took our waitress 12 minutes to greet us. Which we were about to leave for lack of service. She said sorry been swamped but there wasn't but 2 other tables seated in her section. So we ordered our drinks and she said she would be back for our order but we asked if we could get our sons in at least and she let us order his. We got an orange soda, cherry Pepsi and a kid Pepsi. Then my son wanted Mac n cheese and gold fish. She comes back almost 10 minutes later with our drinks but no Cherry Pepsi, diet Pepsi instead. Asked for Cherry Pepsi and she said she would be right back with the cherry Pepsi and to take our order. Another 10 minutes or so passes and she comes back and asks us what we wanted to order and no drink. Husband asks about his soda and she says she will get it as soon as we order. So we ordered our food. She left and went to the kiosk which was right by our table. She starts putting the order in and says your son wanted Mac n cheese and gold fish right? WHAT?? She didn't put his order in yet.... We said yea and said we had requested that first so he could eat before us. She said sorry and walked away.... Still no soda. She walked about about 5 minutes later and we asked about his soda again. She said 1 moment and walked into the kitchen. I flagged down another server and asked her for a cherry Pepsi and she got it right away for us.  Our waitress comes back and says they're all out of Mac n cheese but here is his goldfish so what else would he like? He starts crying because that is really all he wanted. I got him calmed down and finally chose spaghetti. Had we known back when we first ordered we probably wouldn't have stayed. I also asked for a refill on my drink.  About 15 minutes later his spaghetti comes out and the sauce was like water. He didn't like it but ate his goldfish. Ours came out at the same time as his.... My husband ordered an  omelet and it wasn't even the right one and it was cold. My sausage and hashbrowns were cold. Plus I still didn't get my refill. Never did either....  We asked for our check and she never came back with it so we walked up front. Very displeased and told the person at the register we were very displeased with the food and service. They said I'm sorry to hear that, would you like to leave the tip on the card. Hello did you hear what we said?? My husband said \"no we left it at the table.\" He signed and we left.  Worst service and experience ever!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best Denny's I've visited. Very nice inside, comfortable booths. The food was fast, even though they were busy. The staff was polite and attentive. We all enjoyed our breakfast, not one thing wrong. Very happy with this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was great. However,  I observed several health violations.  I brought it to the management attention.  Afterwards,  one of the employees asked if I worked for Denny's.  What difference does it make if I do or not? I know health violations when I see them! Overall a good experience.  Brea was a good server as well."}
{"text":"Quick seating, fast and clean staff, plates are alright, not the best, but servers did great job so it didn't really bother."}
{"text":"I ordered a grand slam online. It was 4 items and they couldn't even get it right. The receipt clearly states what I ordered but my hash browns were missing. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty good only one server usually so it can be slow sometimes. We ordered a appetizer and it never came. It was like pulling teeth to get a refill on a drink. If you come here with small children be prepared to be the least important table in he building. Oh and by the way no blender to make milkshakes even though they are on the menu. We ordered a desert after the server did our check (we didn't ask for the check yet) and he kinda rolled his eyes like he was annoyed. Again we never got our appetizer so that was irritating."}
{"text":"I Didn't think I would ever give 1 star, but the first time I went to Denny's \"All-nighter\" they were not open.  In the summer the hours are reduced even further, but this on campus near L'Albatros so it is probably intended for the students at CWRU.    However, the service is less than spectacular as the one time it was open and I ate there I walked in on a conversation between the front of the house and back of the house where I can only assume I broke up their opportunity to hook up.  If I did, I apologize...I just wanted a burger and thought this place was beyond charming before I entered.    The d√©cor is a little corny for a college kid in my opinion and I wanted this to work because I am always near this area, but this has all of the bad aspects of a Denny's without any of the good ones.  Disappointed all around."}
{"text":"I don't like Denny's at all.   If I wanna get the type of food Denny's serves I'd rather go to some other diner or sports bar type place. I've always found the food here to be overcooked & served lukewarm as if it has been sitting around awhile and just reheated a bit as food is ordered. I mean this for all Denny's, not just this one.    That being said this location was recently renovated (and close by to where I live), and the inside is actually quite nice (I think they also have a patio). The couple times I've been here since the renovation the service has been good (the restaurant also wasn't crowded either time).  Still not a fan of the food here, but since it's by my house I don't mind coming in for a cheap Grand Slam breakfast every now and then. I also believe this location now has liquor license since the renovation (at least that's what a waitress had mentioned to me), so there's that..."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here while on a trip to Las Vegas. We were seated quickly and handed our menus. Our waitress, BJ, was excellent. She was quick, efficient and always with a smile.  As this is a national chain, you know the food is basically going to be the same from one Denny's and the next. We tried the cheeseburger flat-bread appetizer and really enjoyed it.  This facility is older and can use new carpeting but the service far makes up for it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here in the morning on a Sunday before church for breakfast. We weren't expecting anything more than an average, decent breakfast. We were warmly greeted and seated by a nice gentleman that was making light hearted conversation. While we waited for our waitress to return, the gentleman that seated us came back over and continued to chat with us and offered to get us drinks. At this point, I had to take note of the mans name: Joseph. I'm not sure exactly what Joseph's job was.. Because he seemed to be doing everything: waiter, host, kitchen, cleaning. This guy took his job so seriously and brought excellent to what would have just a decent visit. Our food was served hot and was delicious. Our actual waitress was friendly too. We plan to make weekly trips to this location every Sunday to enjoy the excellent service!"}
{"text":"FAQ  Q: My god, are you really trying to get me to go to *this* Denny's? You gotta be fucking kidding me. A: Let's say you've been driving all night. Let's say that Las Vegas Blvd. (aka The Strip) was real busy that night. Let's say the hotel doesn't check you into until 11.00am. Let's say you're really, really hungry. Let's say you wanted a Sampler Platter and substitute the Onion Rings for seasoned fries. Let's say this Denny's is the ideal location. Let's say there is no shame in going to this Denny's.  Q: Why is this Denny's so sad at 5.32am? A: Between the hours of 4.00am and 6.00am on a non-holiday weekend, this town is just sadness. Trust me. I know.  Q: You are a sad, sad human being. A: You should try asking more questions, anyway, let's just say that after growing up in California/Los Angeles and after driving 7 hours (stupid 15 Fwy traffic), there's no better thing than the host asking you: Smoking or Non-Smoking?  Clearly, we were in the Smoking section.  FYI ... It *is* sad. But it's away from the hustle and bustle and it's a good way to \"get away from it all\" before you dive back into The Strip. I was gonna give this 2-stars. Fuck it. Three it is."}
{"text":"This review is NOT FOR FOOD but for the fact that they sell $.99 water bottles here.  Again, $.99 water bottles here. Walk in, go straight and on your right you will find delicious, life-sustaining, hangover-curing, vital-in-ridiculous-desert-heat, CHEAP WATER.   No tax or anything, so bring in a buck and get a lucky penny (you're going to need it) and a bottle of water."}
{"text":"The double chin dishwasher named Alicia had the nerve while she was off the clock to tell me she did more work than me and that her job is much harder than mine because she washes the dishes and takes out trash  and cardboard. She was horifficly rude and I hope Dennys corporate sees this. The server we had was fantastic! Highly satisfied with the service just couldn't stand the rude offensive help that was off the clock."}
{"text":"Freedom. Trans fat. Extreme couponing. Power Tools. Using a completely incomprehensible measuring system. What do all of these have in common? These are some of the most 'Merican ways of life we have to offer in the greatest country in the world. But there is one key aspect missing to this 'Merican list. Known as America's diner, Denny's is one critical staple to the 'Merican heritage and culture we hold dear to our plaque filled, unhealthy hearts. Denny's offers the best experience of the 'Merican way of life when it comes to breakfast: way too much meat, grease filled everything, and some SPOOKY THICCC buttermilk pancakes. All Denny's are special and have their own sense of 'Merica, but the greatest demonstration of the 'Merican life occurred at this particular location. Across the table from me, a man was slamming down a Lumberjack Grand Slam while wearing a shirt saying 'Merican as F***\" (true story) *bald eagle soars in the background, Abraham Lincoln dunks over Kim Jong Un in the name of freedom* I have never been more proud to be a 'Merican in my life after this intimate experience. Following our extravagant, late night feast, our server proceeded to compliment my friend's nose. She said he had one of them \"Owen Wilson types of noses\".  As we all well know, Owen Wilson's nose is just plain ugly. Just is. It's been broken like three times and has even made multiple articles which rank the ugliest celebrity noses, where he usually places in the top 3. This tweet describes his nose perfectly: \"My future is a lot like Owen Wilson's nose: I'm not really sure which direction it's going.\" Although the server probably meant it out of good faith, my friend was deeply offended by the comment. So if you love 'Merica, accidental backhanded compliments, and clogged arteries, Denny's is the perfect place for you."}
{"text":"Want to say thank u to Rhonda the server for getting my order perfect and kiko the chef! Made my special request meal perfect I couldn't have made it better myself thanks guys!"}
{"text":"After reading all the BAD REVIEWS I was very \"iffy\" in having breakfast here, but my mom is in town and we where hungry. We went on Wednesday morning (at around 8:00am)   We where sitted promptly (within a minute) Nuvia who was our server was very attentive & friendly. She gave us the menus and asked what we wanted to drink... We opted for coffee and it was immediatly brought to us. We order and our food was out fairly quickly.   Nuvia kept coming back to ask if we needed anything else, she refilled our coffees & always had a smile.   I will come back again!"}
{"text":"This Dennys is great had a great server by the name of JB and he was excellent the food was good and just had a real good time and very clean yezzir I would recommend this Denny's to everyone that visits Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This location is always friendly when i come with my family, the food is good and service is fast. The only bad thing is when it does get busy people barely fit inside and waiting area is way too small. I just suggest to make this location bigger"}
{"text":"I came in on the 3rd shift and Mirlane and Bom did an amazing job with the customer service. The restaurant was clean and the servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"The employees were helpful and lovely. However, I waited thirty extra minutes in the empty lobby on Thanksgiving for an online order, then did not receive various items from it. Employee sat down with me to explain where everything was accounted for in the bags, and I took his word for it. Stuffing was not included with the turkey meal, tortillas were not included with the skillet meal, and all a la carte items were missing. The fried pancake pieces were inedible, tasting like old dingy oil, but the other parts of the order received were okay. Lesson learned to not skip cooking next year."}
{"text":"It's really busy - but they move fast, in fact sometime too fast that they forget people are here and should be served.  They're moving people in and out like an assembly line, forgetting that they're here because of the people. A few friendly staff and a few not so friendly, it could be they're just too busy and focused on clearing out and ready for the next crowd of folks coming in.   We went back to have breakfast the second day since the wait wasn't long and the food was good, well this time we did wait about 20 minutes to get seated and once our name was called the hostess sat us at our table and stated our waiter would be right with us, well 15 minutes later no waiter so I had to call for someone to come and then another 15 minutes go by before someone finally came to get our order, it was by this time a whole hour had past from the time we sat until we received our food.  We did speak to the manager about and it's seems so busy, especially being on the Vegas strip, you would think that they would have the adequate staff for the amount of tourist that come through there."}
{"text":"I would give this zero stars if possible, but the view from the outdoor seating area at least earned it a star. We were there on a Friday morning, and it was crowded, but we didn't wait too long to sit down. We were seated outside as requested. Our waitress appeared to be a manager/owner since she was not wearing the uniform that all other servers were wearing. She gave us coffee and asked if we were ready to order. When we asked for a minute, she came back 15 MINUTES LATER. We ordered our food and waited, waited, wished for some refills and waited and waited. After 40 minutes, we got up and went inside to pay for our coffees so we could leave and actually get food somewhere. While in line, our server walks by with our food and asked why we were leaving. When I asked what took so long, she blatantly blamed the kitchen. So we follow her back outside, sit at our (now cleared) table in hopes of eating. Food was ice cold. We got up to leave for a second time and offered to pay the cashier for our coffees, and she waved it off like this type of service happens all the time. If the server had just offered to refill our drinks and explained that the kitchen was behind, we would've been understanding. She clearly blamed her incompetence on the people busting their butts in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Although it is in a location kind of hard to find, this place gets BUSY. The night I stopped in, they only had one cook and two waiters (Christmas day). Half the people at my table got different portions of our meals at random times. The one silver lining was our waiter, Jerry. He was very attentive, polite, and fast (dealing with a party of 13), and deserves a raise! I won't be returning to this location simply because of the lack of staff. Service was good, it just wasn't very consistent."}
{"text":"Look @ this food and it tells most of the story. My wife and 2 kids called me at work and said dad we want to go to Denny's for breakfast. I said if corse you guys have fun, once my wife arrived she wasn't seated or spoken to in a timely manner. And when she finally got a table the waitress got her order wrong and didn't put in my other 2 kids orders. They've been in Denny's for over 1 hr with no food. I recommend you guys never ever go here again!!!! This is the worst Denny's. I had a similar experience when I went a few weeks ago and I was by myself..... so trust me it's the management and employees that are the problem here..."}
{"text":"Called in take out while grocery shopping with my son. Finally tried that chicken sriracha sandwich that looks fantastic on TV. With the exception of their phone line being tied into a fax machine and hearing \"eeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaa\" the first four tries was very satisfying. The sandwich was much smaller than on TV but when is it not. Very tasty. My son said his tbone and shrimp was amazing. Always felt Dennys was underrated."}
{"text":"Probably the nicest looking Denny's I've been to, (but it's new, and in North Scottsdale, so it better be), but still lacking.  The waitresses are all great.   But the place is usually dead. And even so, there are always three or four filthy tables waiting to be cleaned.   Not something you want to look at during your whole time there."}
{"text":"This place isn't so bad.. I have received nothing but good service here... I usually just order the value slam BC I just need a quick pancake fix with some bacon and eggs... Every time I order the eggs from here they come out a little too greasy that I have to use a napkin to soak some of that up before I even think about putting it in my mouth.  Their pancakes are pretty good for being a chain.. They are usually fluffy except my last visit where it had some crusty ends BC it was a tad over cooked.  Other than anything it is pretty clean and the staff is friendly but the cook needs to learn how to not use so much grease on those eggs."}
{"text":"We were around this area and were looking for a relatively inexpensive, casual place to eat. Denny's hit the spot.  I had the turkey burger and tried some of the bacon breakfast burrito. The turkey burger was perfectly cooked, with very tender and juicy ground meat, fresh toppings, and soft bun. There was a little spiciness in the burger, contrasted with cool avocado slices in the mix. The fries that came with the meal were nice and crispy. The bacon breakfast burrito was a sizable portion, filled to the brim with bacon, egg, avocado, pico de gallo, cheese, and chipotle sauce.   Service was fast, efficient, and very friendly. I was slightly disappointed that we didn't get a \"monthly special\" menu which had some more avocado dishes we could have chosen from, but we were pretty satisfied with the dishes we did order."}
{"text":"This Denny's has been here forever! There's good reason why, since the location is convenient, being so close to the 60. Service has always been friendly, prices reasonable, and food consistent. Also, it's nice that they are open 24 hours, even on Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"A friend had put in our business card in the weekly drawing for a free meal, and we got picked!  The service when we went was exemplary, and the manager even came over to ask how we were doing.  The \"fit fare\" skillet I had was very filling and tasted great.  Upgrade an extra star!"}
{"text":"Your standard Denny's. The meals are reasonably priced, and service is fast and friendly. They have a special holiday menu which includes gingerbread French toast and pumpkin pancakes. I ordered a build-your-own slam with above mentioned gingerbread French toast, hash browns, turkey bacon, and eggs. I was really looking forward to eating the gingerbread French toast, and I was imagining that it was actual toast made with gingerbread seasoned batter. I was surprised when the meal came out and it was in fact, an actual slice of gingerbread. Unfortunately, it was only very lightly battered and fried, so I didn't really get much of a French toast feeling for me, and it was too crumbly and sweet for me. To add a holiday item to your slam is an extra $.50, which isn't bad in the grand scheme of things, but next time I won't go out of my way and pay extra for the French toast I had.  We also split some nachos, which were a huge size, with freshly toasted chips. The ingredients were pretty basic- chili, pico de gallo, and sour cream, but it tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"wifi is good, ambience is nice and love the $2 $4 $6 $8 menu...a variety of afordable and delicious choices that will surely fill u up"}
{"text":"Broken booth seat, appetizer served WITH the food, restroom soap dispenser BROKEN, trash over flowing, check brought before even half our food was gone....just some of the issues we had tonight....wont be back...."}
{"text":"Second time trying this Dennys.  The first time we left before getting seated.  Plenty of empty tables but totally ignored by the staff.  Thought it was fluke.  Total repeat today until I got a servers attention that we needed a table.  She acted annoyed.  I got a salad and it came served with green eggs.  I pointed it out to the server and see said 'they might have been boiled too long'  Might have?  Made no attempt to replace.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This Christmas breakfast screams bah-humbug! The restaurant was busy Christmas morning. It appears I'm not the only one without things to do on the holiday. The menu highlighted three holiday items: a spiced ham, pumpkin pancakes, and bread pudding french toast.   I ordered a chocolate milk, eggs, hash browns and chose the French toast and pancakes.... I do love pumpkin...This completed the Grand Slam, but this meal was more like a swing and a miss.  The food arrived quickly and looked good. The hashbrown and eggs were average fare. The pancakes looked good - (as seen from the photo). But while the flavor was good, the pancakes were not hot. They arrived with a lump of butter and were so cold that never melted. It didn't attempt to melt. It just sat that like a big lump of butter that it was. I had to scrape it off to the side. That was disappointing but maybe the French toast will be better? Not so much. The slices were also cold, thick, dry, and a wee bit hard. Bleck!  Looks like Denny's left me a lump of coal for Christmas."}
{"text":"Worst Denny's I have ever been to!  First, it took them like 20 minutes to notice there was people in the front that needed to be seated & it was not busy at all! Second it took about 20 more minutes for someone to ask us what we wanted to drink and eat!  Then we waited like an hour for our food and didn't even receive everything we had ordered! A couple other people that had been in there left because they were taking so long! And some people even left their cash and receipt in the front desk because no one was actually there to attend them. I think this was all because there was like 1 cook and like 3 waiters. YOU NEED MORE EMPLOYEES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (At least our waiter was pretty nice)"}
{"text":"A jam packed to the max restaurant with good, cheap food. I dont want to dpend $40 for breakfast around here, but being cheap will cost you too. The line to get in was quick, but it took about 10 minutes to get a server. Still 10 minute wait for $10 breakfast is good."}
{"text":"Had the best experience at this Denny's. The server was courteous and went above and beyond.  Taking 3 kids to eat out anywhere is no fun, especially when they are all preschool age and younger. With that being said it was refreshing to have a server that understood the importance of getting the kids taken care of first. She was even kind enough to do high fives with my boys which made them feel special. My daughter was content just coloring and eating. So while I ate my food she came over to briefly show my daughter how to color a smiley face. It was little things like that that made the experience pleasant. I didn't expect her to do any of that but because she did I greatly appreciate it!! The food was great. I get the Build Your Own grand slam.  The decor was unlike any Denny's I have ever seen before. I noticed they even had a large meeting room for larger groups of up to 50 people. Brilliant!  And get ready for this one.... They will be serving beer and wine shortly. Woohoo!!!  This is not your typical Denny's and I hope other locations will follow suit.  **bonus** get 15% off your entire order when you check in on Yelp!!"}
{"text":"For starters my food was so cold when I received it . The bacon is so thin it doesn't even feel like you are chewing anything . I ordered french toast&  bacon with a side of fruit the fruit wasn't fresh at all very nasty. My family and I picked this place because the price was reasonable and right next to our hotel but even for this price I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to say how bad the service was. The service was so slow. The place had 5 servers and only 10 tables with customers. The server actually complained that they were swamped. None of his tables had more than 2 people. We were served burnt coffee and cold food. It took over an hour to be served.  I guess that is why the food was cold. When I asked to speak to the manager the employee was rude. They actually told me NO. I did get a discount for a really bad meal. I will not go back. I use to go often."}
{"text":"This Denny's is inside The Fiesta Casino.  When I was there on 10/31/11 for lunch I had to wait too long to be seated, too long for the server and much too long to pay the check.  The food was nasty, maybe just fit for a dog and the server gave me the wrong check.  When I mentioned these issues to the Manager, who's breath was as bad as can be, she agreed with my comment that she was understaffed and asked me to complain to the office which did not even answer the phone.    What I find amazing when I was patronizing another Denny's about a year ago, similar problems occurred.  What else could have gone wrong?  My question is, how can this chain survive and where do they find their employees?  After two unpleasant experiences, never again!"}
{"text":"The new refurbish is amazing the restaurant was spotless and our server Mary Mac was IMPECCABLE! The food was delicious and reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Wait time was terrible! When we did get our food the eggs were cold.  Waitress was nice, I know not her fault for the cooking time."}
{"text":"This Denny's is very convenient to the Monte Carlo and the MGM Grand Hotels.  It is open 24 hours and has no big problems.  Sometimes the wait is long, so get there early.  The music is often too LOUD.  The waiters are friendly and as efficient as feasible in light of their work load.  Its food is ok, but it is not a fine dining experience, of course.   I have eaten there many times and expect to do so again on my next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Literally one of the worst experiences I've had at any restaurant. My children have even gone on to tell other people about how Denny's is the worst restaurant and not to go there. Long story short, we arrived at 4pm to an empty restaurant, got a table immediately, drink and food orders were placed, by 5:10 we were walking out still hungry. Our drinks weren't refilled until my 7 year old flagged down our server, twice, to ask for more water. No one stopped by to explain the lengthy wait. Along with my family the 3 parties that came in after us also walked out after sitting without service for so long. As we walked out the doors there was a couple just standing at the host stand. They too left after seeing so many people walk out. I called the number listed to speak with a manager and was told that she wasn't available because they were in the middle of their dinner rush--I called BS and told the woman who answered that I'd just left and therefore knew that there was no rush. There were maybe 5 tables sat including ours. She yelled in my ear for the manager to come on the line. The manager was kind and apologetic, she let me know that she'd just come on the shift and was not aware that there had been any issues--I'm guessing the manager on duty when we came in had already left (I noticed him when we came in and he greeted us). The one star is for how the later manager handled our displeasure. But still I would discourage anyone considering this location to avoid it at all costs!"}
{"text":"We enjoy coming to this Denny's due to their tasty coffee and breakfast, however, lately the managing staff is not effective. There process of hosting their customers is very poor. There is always a long wait to be seated, even though there are few empty tables. Paying the bill is also a long process due to long wait lines. I have no issues with waitresses, they are professional and the food is served timely. No complaints about the kitchen and food. Hopefully, this can be fixed and managed to a 4 start or 5 star restaurant establishment."}
{"text":"The manager in the evening at this Denny's is awesome. She is so fun & personable.  I have to say she made my night with her attitude.  The food was good too but since I order the same thing every single time (The Superbird) I wasn't surprised at all."}
{"text":"We love getting take out here.  Burgers are good and cheaper than a grosse drive thru. Great shakes too!  Can't complain for a dennys.  Never crammed packed either.  Way better than firehouse Subs next door.  That place sucks. Lol"}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. A 24/7, cheap, American, family style diner.  Service is good, coffee is hot, late night staff is friendly, I think a lot of good reviews get left out because people don't eat at dennys then rush to leave a review on yelp. Unless it's a negative experience of course,  and for me not the case. My eggs are served as they were ordered. They have hot sauces, they have all you can eat pancakes for 4 bucks!! Idk what more people are expecting out of an establishment like this but for the past 8 years this establishment has met all expectations from the moment I walk into the door.  Oh, and I'm on their free WiFi, 5/5"}
{"text":"The food is alright, it's Denny's.  My biggest problem with this place is the hostess.  She is loud and rude and sadly we were seated right next to the hostess table and I barely made it through breakfast. Our waitress was great, but I can't imagine having to deal with that hostess again, so we'll stay away."}
{"text":"Not happy at all! Ants on the table and an ant in my water... pancakes raw and ham was not ham. It is slices of sandwich meat stacked together and warmed in the microwave! Wtf??? Disgusting! I sent all the food back. The waiter was vert nice and his service was great."}
{"text":"lumberjack slam was great , waitress gave great service , got a seat right away and coffee was very good !!!"}
{"text":"great server, slow slow slow kitchen."}
{"text":"This Denny's has a good atmosphere with cool people! However, the food is decent but really nothing to write home about!!!!"}
{"text":"Waiting for food is too long. A bunch of items are out of the menu. They are out of fries for once. Came here on a Sunday night and the place looks dead but waiting is ridiculous."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived about 10ish and were greeted and seated quickly. Our server Linda was kind and took our orders within 5m. I've been to this Denny's in the past and found it to be slow, not well with customer service. It definitely has improved. My husband got refills on his coffee and was pleased. Even though Ms. Linda forgot 2 items from what I requested it's no biggie (we are humans, and forget things) :) I will return in another occasion!"}
{"text":"Put 1 star cause idk how to put none the server named shayna took our order then not a single employee asked us anything and for about 45 mins sat there while people surrounding that came after us ate their food and left worst service I have ever had in probably a lifetime renovation did nothing for them except a flawed environment and perceptive of any of type normal service let alone filibertos service"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 18/100  I thought that perhaps dining here with another set of friends might shift my perspective on the restaurant and maybe even enhance my experience. However, I believe 3.5 seems just about right.   That morning, my friend and I decided to get something heavy and carb-filled to prep ourselves for classes (and the eventual brain drain that came with it). I got a banana caramel french toast skillet that came with 2 sunny side eggs and bacon (with an alternative choice of sausage) for about $8. Service wasn't as swift as I would've expected and food was good, but not outstanding.   Also, I felt like the restaurant might've been a little understaffed that day. Not a one person came up to our table despite my friend and I raising our hands in hopes of asking a question or two. Don't get me wrong though, the remaining staff did try very hard to accommodate the quick-filling tables and I appreciate their patience and cheerfulness."}
{"text":"First time ordering online. Wanted 2 Of the same type of breakfast when I got there was told by the manager oh we thought the system glitched only made one will have the second one out soon so one cold breakfast one hot breakfast.  When I get home second order is not what I ordered go back to the restaurant and asked for a refund given an excuse that he didn't have my order online. So when I asked for my refund now it has to be done by computer and I have to wait 24 business hours when my order wasn't online???? This location sucks I will never come back."}
{"text":"This location doesn't take phone in orders per their management. Food is warm and right at this location. But the waitresses seem a little off and what kind of diner won't take in phone orders?? She said they get too many no shows I don't believe that! I call it laziness especially since dennys just released that commercial about calling ahead etc."}
{"text":"This place has really declined! Tonight we ordered our regular chicken fried steak skillets extra gravy eggs over medium and we got hardly any gravy and eggs were over cooked"}
{"text":"This is probably the Denny's with the most polite staff ever. I have been here so many times and every time, I am seated quickly, our drink orders are taken right away, and everyone, not just our server, comes to check on us. Even when we've been here and only one server was available with 6 tables, she made sure that our glasses were never empty and she always checked on us, every run she made in the dining room. This restaurant is always clean and for a 24 hour diner, that is very important. The prices can't be beat. Try the nachos, they're amazing!"}
{"text":"I arrived at Denny's around 1:30 am on Monday morning. There was only 1 person in the restaurant. I ordered my food and didn't see my server the entire time after I got my food. She didn't check on me to see if I needed a refill or wanted any other item on the menu. So when I finished eating, I got up and searched for my server. She was in a different dining area and was watching video's on her smartphone of a guy playing pretend drums on several women butts. REALLY? I tipped her not because of her stellar customer service, but because I am in the service industry and I try to show respect for those that serve the public too. Hard to find good help these days...If this was one of the better Denny's in the area, what does that say about Denny's??? WOW!!!!"}
{"text":"Server was the best part of this place she had great customer service. The cups our waters came is were dirty with food particles. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese but they only gave me scrambled eggs. The kitchen claimed it had cheese but it didn't. Kitchen staff was rude yelling out loud about it."}
{"text":"The food preparation and quality is superb. The coffee is excellent and the restaurant is CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!"}
{"text":"Went early 8am and no wait. Food was great and service was okay. Try to get a seat by the window, nice view!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a Sunday morning as a sort of last resort to get a bit of greasy sustenance in us.  As far as chain breakfast diners goes Denny's is sort of my stand by.  It was pretty busy so we waited for maybe 10 minutes before being seated.  The staff seemed pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people there, which is kind of ridiculous considering it was Sunday at 11 am.  They randomly refilled our waters and we only got 2 cups of coffee for the hour and a half we were sitting there.  Also I ordered all you can eat pancakes, sweet deal at 4 bucks but they only asked if I wanted more one time.  Of course I said yes, but only out of principle.  I'm not paying for all you can eat just to be swindled by some chain.  Decent food, shitty service.  I'd say I won't go back to this location but I think this is just a matter of Denny's in general.  In middle school I was at a Denny's in Philadelphia and this dude came in with a bloody rag over his hand asking my sister to help find his girlfriend.  Actually I should review that Denny's.  Why do I like this place?"}
{"text":"Soda is ALWAYS flat here, if I'm going to pay for soda i'd like it to be decent... Table was dirty as well"}
{"text":"very impressed.  went here twice.  great, fast service.  hot, fresh tasting food.  not busy at all.  which is kind of nice.  single traveller here.  good view of the streetscape below.  love the 2 for 1 happy hour drink special.  what a good deal.  I had the cheeseburger the first time, and the chicken club the second visit.   will go back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Would give zero this place dont have its shit together waitress said we dont have shakes when i wanted a shake like fat kids want cake hate this dennys get your shit together!!!"}
{"text":"Really bad. This was my first visit and I would not go back. I am learning that Denny's is really low-end junk food. Generally, the food is very oily and soggy with grease. They are a breakfast place that is sold all day. Really, a waste."}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood and wanted to grab a quick breakfast before we got back to unpacking all of our boxes. This location is clean and open right from the entry way, which is nice. There were still red, white, and blue decorations all over the place which seemed a little late to me, but that won't turn me away from the place by any means.  We ended up ordering lunch items and my hubby ordered the bacon cheeseburger something or other and I ordered the \"diner favorite\" macho nachos. Best nachos I've ever had! Seriously delicious. The cheeseburger was good (per my hubby) but when the order first came out there were about 10 fries on the plate. It is a small thing to remark about but we were just curious how the heck that happened? The chef HAD to have known when he put it up on the counter that it looked empty. We ended up asking the server if that was normal and she said it is a standard 7 oz that they use for fries, but even she said that it wasn't enough. She brought more fries out before we left, which was nice of her, but kind of odd that we had to say something in the first place.  The server was really friendly and we enjoyed our meal. The location and convenience of this Denny's adds to the overall rating and we will definitely return now that we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast after realizing that number 1, renting a car is cheaper than getting a taxi on the strip and number 2, once you rent said car, you open up your trip to a world of cheaper options not on the strip. Your wallet will thank you. Case in point, I paid $26 for two people at Denny's and at a buffet on the strip for breakfast, I paid $40 for two people. Do the math y'all."}
{"text":"I know - i know.  Its Denny's.  What were you expecting?  Got there at 7:15 am and was seated immediately (place was empty).  About 10 minutes later a VERY frantic little guy got my drink order.  About 10 minutes after that I actually got my coffee.  Coffee was good.  The waitress finally came and man she was GRUMPY.  Was not even trying to pretending to be nice.  Ordered a skillet and a waffle.  Flash forward about 30 minutes and people that came in after me have ordered, eaten, and left.  Had to ask for more drinks more than once.  The excitable little guy came back and asked me to donate 3 or 9 dollars to a charity.  I finally asked about my food and the grumpy waitress assured me it was almost ready.  Finally a random guy brought me breakfast.  Someone else's.  An omelet.  He insisted it was for me.  Eventaully i convinced him i did not order that.  About 10 minutes later my skillet and waffle arrived!  Waitress forgot syrup so she grabbed it off of the table next to me - an occupied table.  They asked for it back.  Anyhow bit into without a doubt the WORST waffle i have ever had.  1 bite and done.  Styrofoam.  The skillet was ok - VERY greasy.  I don't know if one of the other 47 Denny's on the strip are better, but avoid this one."}
{"text":"i haven't been to a denny's in years......used to love the slam breakfasts and the shredded potato hashbrowns......but memories were ruined by what is now denny's. for starters, what could i expect....it's a classic greasy spoon style restaurant, but i've been to plenty of greasy spoons before, but they usually have great, friendly service and the food is served up quick and hot........... our server was the poorest excuse for a server i've ever experienced. even with the name tag celebrating his 14 years of service. it took 30 minutes to get breakfast in a restaurant that was virtually empty. our server was more consumed with reading a magazine in the server station than filling our coffee, water and teas......the coffee, by the way, was full of grounds, had to ask for another cup of coffee, sans grounds. food was sub-par, server asked how everything was, after we had eaten it,. leaving alot of it uneate. we asked for the check, he disappered, we waited another 10 minutes, then finally asked the hostess for our check, paid and left..... the best part of this meal was seeing denny's in my rear view mirror!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here Tuesday morning and the manager miranda was out standing!! She was a hostess, running drinks for the servers, in the kitchen helping the cooks, cleaning tables and cashing people on register and not just that but our waitress was busy and she came to us and grabbed our food order and drinks for our waitress. She checked up on us and every other costumer sitting down. My husband and I came again Friday night and we were happy to see her because she's hardworking. We will definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"While we toured the Strip the evening before we decided to meet here for breakfast before hitting the Strip for a day of shopping and hanging out.  Heading up the escalators we realized that a lot of people had the same idea as us and we put our name on the list for a 25 minute wait.  As we were sitting in the area outside the restaurant waiting a lady had come out and passed us some 20% off coupons they received from the manager since they were leaving that day and wouldn't be able to use them.  I appreciated it but, at the same time this should have been the biggest red flag but, we were hungry and had already been waiting for 15 minutes.  Our group trip friends started to arrive just as we were sat.  We got a booth and our server finally came over to get our drink order after about 5 minutes.  We ordered mozzarella sticks to start and I asked for a side of bleu cheese dressing.  10 minutes later our mozzarella sticks came but, no bleu cheese dressing.  After about 15 more minutes our server finally came back even though I had tried to flag her down multiple times and by this time I had told my friends to just eat them and I would make another order since they were about to be cold.  When the server did come back I explained that she forgot the side of dressing and they were now cold so we wanted to get another order.  In her defense she did remove them from the bill and give us the second order for free and she did seem to be working on half the restaurant by herself.  The only thing that was done quickly was the filling of our empty coffee cups and we did have to get up and go into the server station to get more creamers.  The breakfast was fine but, the whole thing took about an hour and fifteen minutes and people come here to get in and out quickly which sort of defeats the purpose of coming here.  Not to mention places like this make money by turning tables quickly so, they are probably losing out from being so badly understaffed."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch when visiting my sister in the Charlotte area. The hostess did not greet us and wasn't the friendliest. We were seated by another worker who was sweet. Our waiter's name was Tariq and he was so pleasant. He always checked on us and was very polite. It is your average Denny's, the food tasted usual, cleanliness was average, and you always hear the employees talk about their personal lives off in the distance. The food did take 40 minutes to come out, however, which I found to be a bit longer than most Denny's I've been to. It's your typical Denny's, not too much I can say that was different."}
{"text":"Not a bad restaurant. And not a great restaurant.   My brother and I went to the Eastern at Tropicana Denny's for a late night supper. The server was friendly and attentive to beverage refills. The food and prices were decent. I enjoyed eating to the oldies.  One minor complaint I had was the sign advertising a $3.99 cheese burger meal deal. However the fine print says it is only for weekdays. Hard to catch the fine print cruising on Tropicana. This complaint is not significant enough to lower my rating: 3 stars."}
{"text":"We were waiting to be seated when the hostess walked up and seated the 4 people behind us. I said \"excuse me we were here first\". She goes \"oh ya\". Then seats us. Then we wait and wait and wait and notice she actually takes the other 4 people's order first!  Oh my are you stupid!!!  Wait then I realize I am at Denny\"s. This was the first time I've eaten here in years. Now I know why I don't and won't eat at Denny's. Same bad service from employees who truly don't care about their performance!"}
{"text":"AWFUL!!!  Went about 11 pm and not very many customers were around. Wait staff took over 10 minuets to even show up at our table and when she did she was rude acting as if it was a huge bother for her to wait on us.  Management and hostess were standing around doing nothing, even after was asked when our waitress would come by and take out order.    We left and will never return!"}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly. The prices are good, the food is warm and the coffee is hot. Not much to say about Denny's except that the Denny's on Scottsdale Rd is a step above the rest. It's recently been renovated, it's clean and comfortable. My sundae was delicious and it was only $3, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly new Denny's so we wanted to try it out.   I LOVE THIS PLACE. It's the nicest, cleanest, and friendliest Denny's I've been to.   As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated. The seats are really nice and comfortable; all the furniture is visibly new and clean. The inside area has a few TVs to keep you entertained.   Once seated, the hostess told us that our waitress would be with us shortly. While looking at the menu, the restaurant manager came over to us to see if we were doing alright.   The menu offers so many choices: pancakes, sandwiches, soups, burgers, etc. Their milkshakes are really great too.   We got the Invisible Woman Slam from their Fantastic Four menu, half nachos, and strawberry pancake puppies. The serving sizes are huge and food is great. I was pleasantly surprised with the pancake puppies because they were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.   Overall, great experience with wonderful food and service. I definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Long story short, everyone got sick after eating here. No manager around, server had more than 9 tables by himself and no help, host was nice but again did not help him at all! NEVER AGAIN! All dennys in vegas suck!"}
{"text":"Another spot that I like 24/7. The staff is great. The food is standard Denny's food. This place has been here for 30 years and I have gone there for that long. Never very busy and always good service."}
{"text":"The service has gone down hill at this restaurant. There is a only a few good waitstaff that have been working at this location for several years. But most of the newer employees are rude and always have an attitude. There is no need to get an attitude when someone is just simply trying to order food. I literally had to ask for a different sever because I'm not going to sit and try to enjoy my meal with a rude waitress who couldn't be \"bothered\" to service us... even though that is her job.  Luckily, the replacement server was much more nice, efficient and has been working at this location for 4 years.  The manager I spoke too at the time was very nice and understanding about my complaints and issues.  So the one star goes directly to the server with a bad attitude. I really hope the service changes at this location! It gets annoying having to guess whether or not I will get decent service  here!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  I ordered eggs scrambled dry.  Got an over easy egg instead.  Even if I liked runny eggs you could see it was over cooked.  Toast wasn't delivered with the meal.  Told the waitress that my order was wrong.  Took it back and returned the plate with the scrambled eggs that were under cooked for me.  Still no toast.  Before the waitress disappeared I checked the hash browns.  They were cold.  Told her to take it back and I didn't want anything to eat.  While my wife finished eating, I wanted a refill on my coffee.  Had to flag down another waitress to get a refill.  It was not even busy.  Didn't even get a sorry from the waitress when I paid for my wife's breakfast.  I did tip her 10 cents.  This restaurant must be a training location for the staff."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try this Denny's becayse of previous reviews but the food was good, served fast and hot. Our server, Dan, was great. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Anyone who gives this place a bad review has not had Tammy for a server! From the moment I walked in she made me feel like that favorite cousin that you haven't seen in years instead of treating me like some fat slob who just walked in off the street. Now I'm usually a salty little bitch about my service but try as I might I can't find anything to complain about when I look in her eyes. Now I'm a grown man but when the cook Alfredo checked on me I felt like the prettiest girl in the place. He looked me in the eyes and I just knew that he was genuinly concerned with making sure that I had the tastiest burger of my life. He honestly made me question my status as a heterosexual mad in modrn society. I will absolutely be returning to this location if not just to see the goddess known as Tammy and the hunky beast knowj as Alfredo aka sexiest man alive! DELICIOUS FO SHO!!!"}
{"text":"This Denny's is to close to where we stay when we're in the Tempe area.  I think it's \"average\" for a Denny's.  It's just plain okay.  We were there for breakfast.  We were seated fairly fast.  Drinks and order also delivered reasonably fast.  Server appeared to need a little cleaning up himself but he was pleasant and efficient.  The interior of the restaurant could also use some sprucing up."}
{"text":"The sever was awesome but the cooks where bad. My kids cheeseburger smelled like it was warmed up in a microwave. My burger was burnt I took a few bites & had to leave it was so bad. The sever asked if we wanted a box but it was so bad we left all our food hardly touched"}
{"text":"At 3am, it's a great place to unwind and fill your stomach with diner food before heading home."}
{"text":"My last review I gave a 2 star and this updated review it still gets a 2 star. Horrible service and slow. Server only came to the table once. There was only 4 tables seated and it was 8:30p on a Friday night. It took forever to get the server so that I could get a to-go box and check. I would complain to the manager but she was busy looking up things on social media. I went to try to pay and the manager slowly walks up with her face focused on her phone. The only reason this place gets a 2 star is because of the price of the $2,4,6,8 deal and the staff was friendly. I really wish someone higher up would read this and fix the problem here"}
{"text":"So this is my second time here. Came with my sister and the kids. We both ordered dishes with eggs. The food came out and I couldn't understand why the eggs looked like they were cooked in a mold in the microwave. I had an omelette and it came out looking like an empanada. Very peculiar looking. They also tasted fake. I kept asking my sister, do the eggs taste fake to you? She said they do taste funny.  When the server brought our bill, I couldn't resist. I asked her if the eggs were fake. She said \"Well if you don't ask for shelled eggs we give you powdered ones.\" I was dumbfounded. Huh? Why on earth would we ask for eggs in the shell when ALL eggs come with a shell? How are we to know that if we don't say hey tell the grill person I want shelled eggs that we will get fake powered eggs?   So lesson learned. Next time you go to Denny's make sure you ask for eggs in the shell."}
{"text":"The seats in the booth we sat in were dirty with dried ketchup. The food portions are smaller than the other Dennys we usually go to(2 eggs vs 3 we usually in the skillet). Also the ketchup is very obviously watered down. We're not usually in this part of town so we probably won't stop here again. The staff was okay I guess."}
{"text":"Called in for breakfast. The food was really good and the service great, especially considering how busy it was. Very nice."}
{"text":"Bleck! Stopped here Sunday morning for a quick breakfast. We waited about 20 minutes for 2 people (understandable its a sunday morning) but ended up waiting over 30 minutes for our food, that's 30 minutes of waiting after we ordered! There was nothing good about this breakfast at all. It took forever to get our food, when it finally came out the food was cold, everything was tasteless, the sausage was burnt, the toast was burnt, the hash browns had no taste and were completely dry, the eggs were not cooked how I asked and our waitress was in her own little world.... I know Denny's isn't a fantastic place or usually at the top of my list to eat at in the first place, but we had to pass it to go where we were going, we had not had it in quite sometime, its cheap and we thought it would be simple, easy and ok. But it wasn't even ok, it was just as I said earlier.... BLECK! I wont be going back here, I will drive further to hit up an IHOP or spend some more money and hit up a local spot!  Methinks not!"}
{"text":"Denny's?  Seriously?  Do you know how long it's been since I've eaten at Denny's?  (Looks through reviews.)  Huh.  Apparently less than two years.  I would have said longer.  At least this time, it was in Charlotte (or the Charlotte area anyway).  Since we were out and about running errands, and I was really hungry, we stopped for a bite.  But there aren't that many places open on a weekend morning in this part of town.  At least, I don't think there are.  Sure, there are fast food places - at least a couple of them.  And there is Cracker Barrel, but we've done that before.  So we chose Denny's.  What can I say?  Those Grand Slam commercials at least mean that they work when we have few other choices.  The service was spotty.  It started good, but rapidly went downhill.  They seemed more interested in talking about what they did the night before (at least one staffer seemed to have been at the zombie walk) than helping customers.  One person dropped a glass.  Not a big deal, but it took a while to clean up, and that seemed to set everyone all a-tizzy.  Food was better on the menu than on the table, but that is no real surprise.  A company like Denny's has a bunch of money to spend on presentation and (apparently) little on preparation.  The one surprise here was the pancake puppies.  These were a bit like hush puppies, only made of pancake batter.  They were pretty good - a bit on the sweet side, but nonetheless very tasty.  They come in orders of six, and I'm not sure you would want more than that.  In fact, a single order for an entire table might be good as an appetizer.  Other than that, nothing much to say.  We might wait a couple more years before we come back again.  Or maybe more if I can resist those Grand Slam commercials."}
{"text":"This place is horrible if I could give negative stars I would. We went here 7/18/17 at approximately 11pm. It was pretty empty and we were seated immediately initially it started off good the server brought our drinks and took our order. Our food came out quickly but however my daughters order was wrong so she took it back to the kitchen to fix. After that we couldn't get a hold of the waitress although we seen her literally running up and down the restaurant doing things ... but it wasn't busy and we couldn't get her attention. Finally 30 minutes later my husband had to go to the front to get help then another lady came to help (a buster) and we told her about my daughters food that never came back out and now our food was cold waiting for her food. The waitress said she forgot and 15 minutes later came out with it. I ordered another side fry to have hot fries with my burger and it was brought out as we were finished with our food .....2 orders when I only wanted 1 ....both wasted... (we were done with our COLD food already) So when I mentioned it on the bill to only remove one... the one I didn't order the lady at the cash register was so rude and said She had to ask our server about it.... another 20 minute wait.... our server crossed out the extra fry but the lady at the cash register still charged me and when I told her about it she replied didn't you say you just want to get out of here.... I told her that I was going to give a bad review for this type of service and she that's fine sarcastically. Also .....my my husband and son got really sick after eating here with vomiting and diarrhea GREAT VACATION!!!! AND went our entire meal without drink refills after asking several times. I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS DENNYS AGAIN and I suggest if u value your health, good service, and hot food with a beverage then this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"I should have known better! I haven't been to a Denny's in 30+ years, and based on this morning's experience, won't EVER go back. Smell in the restaurant was obnoxious and overwhelming. Also, not a good look to be greeted outside by the cook and the waitress who were at the entrance on a \"smoke break\". Should have followed my instincts and turned around and ran!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came to Denny's on New Year's Day 2016 and had a better experience.  Our waitress, Patricia was courteous but not engaged. She didn't get my order right even after I pointed to my choice. (She did apologize and got me the right meal but she charged me the higher priced meal on my check, the cashier corrected it). It was hard to enjoy my meal because of the multiple distractions from too many young people and their antics. One teen vomited in the dining room on his way to the bathroom"}
{"text":"It's Denny's....u get what u would expect...is it anything special? No, not really...but for a quick breakfast in a pinch it's not too shabby. Service is average-ticket times on this Sunday morning seemed a little long for the crowd; especially since breakfast fare typically has a quick turnaround...but nonetheless overall for a chain restaurant it's a no frills decent breakfast/brunch spot..."}
{"text":"Graveyard shifts Cook is Horrible! Don't go in until the new shift starts at 5 a.m. My parents worked in restaurants, and I had sympathy for the server, and left a tip. As I understand his income is his tips. The cook should be fired, his eggs, pancakes, and bacon were horrible. I won't be returning, and will drive to the Rural road location to get a good meal."}
{"text":"Everytime we come here . Its on the weekends for breakfast.  Its so nice that there no wait . We usually get a good waiter  , always on top of are drinks and if we need any thing else . I was disappointed two weeks ago . I ask for the pot roast and the waiter said they where out of it . They do have great orange juice , veggie skillet and the omelette is pretty good ."}
{"text":"Jesse was a great server !!! Was very attentive and kind. Will be coming back for sure ! Also the manger heather made sure everything was correct and we were satisfied. Thanks team!"}
{"text":"So, I probably should have expected that Denny's wouldn't meet the 5-star \"Yelpian\" standards but what they lack in quality they usually make up for in quantity. We ordered reeses peanut butter cup pancakes and do you think they put the blessed cups in the pancakes...nope...they lathered on peanut butter and some weird mix of chocolate and nutella... tasty but not what we wanted...the only redeeming factors were our awesome waitress and the free wifi.  Yes, our waitress was on point.  She remembered every detail of our order and jumped at every request.  I just wish I could remember her name and give a shout out.  Besides that, they come to your table every 5 minutes offering free coffee refills. Meh."}
{"text":"This Denny's experience was very poor. They forgot to ask for what drinks we wanted and tried to make us order when we were not ready. After we finish our drink we had to wait 15min in order to find someone. I had to call someone else's waitress cause I couldn't find mine. When I asked the other waitress she was very unpleasant she gave me a dirty look. And when we finished the water we asked for more from our waitress and she also gave me a dirty look. When they served the hash browns they looked like flakey white potatoes they weren't normal. My friend ordered a sundae and all he ordered was just oreos in it and when the waitress comes she serves him with everything. What if he was allergic... Lawsuit alert. Overall this experience was horrible."}
{"text":"What a typical Denny's!  I came here for breakfast and it was packed. Fortunately, the line was just long and they were just taking time to clean up and get organized. I got seated fairly quickly, within 10 minutes.  First thing I noticed was how dirty the utensil was. But I tried to ignore it. I had the grand slam. It was good, but not as good. The sausage was way too soft and not as crispy. It felt like it was heated and re-heated. Service was pretty good. The lady was really nice.  Pretty standard Denny's."}
{"text":"Terrible. Ordered a burger, and after an hour and a half still no food. Sat in the grossest, most crowded area I've ever experienced. The lady next to me had to complain after 30 minutes when the didn't bring her drink out. And I overhead the waitress saying that Spiderman 3 was her favorite movie. Don't go here."}
{"text":"What can I say it is Denny's. Food is what it is but the waitress where friendly and chatty"}
{"text":"Es ist eben wie jedes Denny's denke ich. Das Essen ist okay, die Bedienung fand ich okay. War nur alles etwas langsam."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this dennys. The restaurant itself is cleaner and nicer than any dennys I've ever seen. The food was tasty and fresh. And best of all, service from our waitress (Sherryl? I think) was cheerful, friendly and prompt!"}
{"text":"We walked in, somebody who looked like a manger greeted us and told us to sit down, he would get us a menu. 20 minutes later he was nowhere to be seen, the only waitress completely ignored us. Didn't even get a menu so we decided to walk out. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Bad service. Takes me 1/2 hr to get a stack of two pancakes? Really.  Dennys food is Dennys food."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We were staying at Palazzo and looking for a reasonable breakfast option to eat at and then get back in the pool! This Dennys is perfectly located in what I consider the best part of the strip- the end. He had the slamwich- omg... Its like a grilled cheese on crack. It has eggs, bacon, sausage, ham and cheese on cinnamon toast. I had bananas foster french toast. Omg. SO delicious we actually made it back for a late night meal after a show. LOVE dennys. Wish we had them in Staten Island, Ny where I  live. Def beats out Perkins and IHOP. Love the cherry limeades!! Will def return!"}
{"text":"Litchfield and I-10 best Denny's in the valley. The staff there have their A game on all the time."}
{"text":"Stopped in to my tried and trusted Denny's for a late night snack (breakfast) we beat the drunk crowd in, as it was still 10 p.m.  They had two crusty/dusty women working the floor this night, at least on our side.  Took forever to get drinks. Took forever to order, took even longer for the kitchen to kick out the breakfast avocado burrito, and double bacon cheese burger. Forget about refills, you could walk to the waitstaff area and get your own refills.  When the food came out, our waitress wasn't the one that dropped it off, it was the second dusty crusty old lady. And when I say dropped it off, she basically did a drive by delivery. Her shadow was still there, but she was gone, and we attempted to ask for ranch, and hot sauce, but we were talking to the back of her head as she was zipping around the corner. She was faster the creamed corn through a goose.  As the \"Duke\" of this joint I see the staff all the time, and these two are always outside killing their lungs with nicotine. LoL  Didn't think I would have to write a crap review on my digs here at this store.  I'll give the two old birds the benefit of doubt that they were incontinent, uncontrollable bladder. And this was our cheat weekend where we were allowed to go full retard and have carbs. Es ok,two quaaludes and she'll love me in the morning."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great staff and clean restaurant. I will be back here. Located right in front of Mirage."}
{"text":"Worst service ever my Togo order sat over 15 minutes until I asked to have it I'll never come back here. The cashier was slow incompetent and rude. The manager was gossiping with the waitresses while food sat waiting to be served. I bet my food is cold.   Got home and I was right the bisque and gravy ice cold my over medium eggs were over easy. The hash browns were not hydrated enough so they were hard and cold. Stay away from this s Denny unless you want crappy food and worse service."}
{"text":"Worst Dennys ive ever been to. Waited 30 minutes for a half plate of food. Waitress was unattentive. Meanwhile our buddies in the table next to us ate, payed the bill, and were completely done before WE EVEN GOT OUR FOOD. The manager offered no discount or comp or anything for our troubles. Thats pretty bad service. Id give it half a star if i could.."}
{"text":"Not the best part of town. She is an idiot. Safer here than North Strip near Jerry's or worse Silver Nugget. Food is always good. Across street from E. Cannery."}
{"text":"If it's late and you're near The Mirage, Venetian, or Treasure Island on the strip and have the late night munchies, this Denny's hits the spot!  Recommendations: Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs."}
{"text":"5 stars for James D.  Came in for take out after driving for 7 hrs, accident/heavy traffic delays, frustrated and James totally just made me laugh, was patient and very pleasant. I'm very glad I walked in to this Dennis. My mood is much better to continue on my road trip. :)"}
{"text":"This Denny's has the worst service in the entire chain. We have eaten there 5-6 times since it opened last summer and have had service so bad 3 times that it ruined our dining experience.  Today the waiter didn't write down our order, had to cone back in 5 minutes because he forgot it before submitting it, brought a bowl if soup we didn't order. After waiting 10 minutes I went up and asked that we get our salads before our entrees and still had to send him back for dressing because he forgot what we ordered. My wife never received the GF roll she asked for (Which was on the receipt) but by that time we gave up and left.  Three strikes and you are out Denny's!"}
{"text":"100 percent sure my server was on heroin. The methadone clinic must be close."}
{"text":"Online order not ready, it had not even been started when I got there. Ordered scrambled eggs, got uncooked sunny side up. Ordered and paid for toast, not in the bag."}
{"text":"An awful place for breakfast. Bad customer service. Waitress was rude and waited twenty minutes and still couldn't get a proper menu to order from. I wouldn't recommend this place unless desperate. Hotel was nice, which earned the star."}
{"text":"Food is ok but it is WAY overpriced. $10 for an omlette, plus $2 extra for coffee makes for an expensive breakfast.  I imagine it's because it's a franchise And the fact that the AMC plaza has crazy expensive rents.  Better breakfast option just down the street."}
{"text":"Terrible service Terrible!!!!!!  I ordered takeout (steak sirloin) and when i got home i opened my plate and got eggs and sausages. I called and they told me there was nothing they could do.   Also another  time i went there i ordered a drink with my meal  for takeout and never got the drink. I will never return here again just wasted my money. They should fire the hostess at the front desk she's the person that made this mistake twice."}
{"text":"Came in on Monday September 12, 2016 at 6am , Made a to go order , on the all American Siam with sour dough ! The server/cashier NORMA was very very sweet , such a nice person. We've had her numerous times , and she give awesome customer service.   There was no problem with our order . Always on point !   Thank you Norma for such awesome service."}
{"text":"Good food and I always enjoy the service I receive at Denny's but, this particular location didn't quite hit the mark. Received our drinks with no straws and it took out waitress awhile to return back to our table and we had to ask for straws. Once we received our food the waitress just walked away without asking if there was anything else we needed. Never checked in to see how the meal was going. Where was the customer service? If I want my food just be handed to me with no acknowledgment then I would've went through a McDonald's drive thru. Our server was Jamie. She was polite towards the end but, I can't say if they were short handed or not in the kitchen area. Regardless that's not an excuse to lack in customer service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here - it's much better than ihop. Our waiter was very nice, and his service was quick and accurate. Very clean and comfortable restaurant. I give it a thumbs-up."}
{"text":"The place is packed when you walk in.... and it is probably because you have to wait fifteen minutes to get the most important part of your order coffee! !! And another twenty to thirty minutes for your food felt bad for the server's he was apologizing over and over stating that the kitchen was backed up.. but the omelet was good and we were not in a hurry... and our meals and drink was under twenty bucks.."}
{"text":"This is the worst Denny's I have ever visited.  I was there with a group of six on December 30.  The manager had the double role as cook.  The food was cold and horrible, and the coffee was cold. This restaurant really give Denny's a bad name."}
{"text":"The worst Denny's in town. Our order came incomplete, the food was poorly presented (nothing looked like the menu) we finished our meal and never got our pancakes or toast. I will never come back to this location"}
{"text":"Wasn't good experience at all. Server seemed to not know what she was doing.  Had to ask for our toast twice. Water glasses were dirty with lipstick on the rim."}
{"text":"My friends and I came on a Saturday at noon and didn't leave until after 2. There was a wait to be seated even though half the restaurant was empty. Our waiter only had 4 other tables in our section but apparently \"was swamped\". He got our drink orders wrong, brought my friend a bowl instead of a cup of soup, forgot my side of toast and never asked what type of bread I wanted. We also waited 20 minutes for our order to be taken, nearly 45 minutes for our food and 20 minutes for our check after we had finished eating. Not to mention, when I finally did get my food, it was subpar. I had the peanut butter pancake meal but was barely given any hashbrowns and the bacon was super floppy and fatty. Also, my pancakes were supposed to come with peanut butter and chocolate sauce drizzled on top but instead just had peanut butter sauce messily spread and I was given a cup of chocolate sauce to spread on top myself. Tables around us were also mad about the slow service and the staff's excuse was that \"they were swamped\" and there was \"a lot of tickets so the kitchen was backed up\". I could understand this excuse if they were super busy but the restaurant was less than half full. I think it's an under-staffing issue but our waiter was also not very polite and couldn't get our drink or food orders right, even though he wrote them down. On top of that, he also got our bill wrong and charged us for things we never ordered and forgot some things that we had. We won't come back here again."}
{"text":"Went here and enjoyed the service they go above and beyond with customer service. The food was standard yet good the waitress was very attentive and nice the place gets busy on certain days so expect to possibly wait, but when they get busy it does not decrease the service you receive."}
{"text":"So my waitress I went there for her great service was no longer at the location. New waitress was good. She got the order right but apparently cooks don't know appetizers should come out sooner than 1 minute before regular food comes out.   The appetizer was so skimpy compared to the visit before.  Food was good otherwise.  Doubt ill be going to this location much more."}
{"text":"We went this morning for Sunday breakfast. As you can imagine the place was full when we arrived but they sat us right away. The hostess was gracious and our server came to our table right away to get our drink orders. It was a steady flow of people all during our stay there and yet our food was brought correctly and in a timely manner; everything was delicious. Our server was very nice. And the restaurant was clean. We'll definitely visit this Denny's again!"}
{"text":"I know it's just a Denny's, but I have always appreciated a tasty Grand Slam any day of the week and, after I had just lost over $300 on (what I still believe to this day was rigged) Blackjack, I needed something on the cheap.    We popped in at a not-so-prime time (there were probaby only 5 other tables filled in the whole place) and our waiter failed to deliver prompt refills - one of us made it through the whole meal with no refill.  Food came out pretty quick, but even though I expected everything to be cooked into one greasy mess, the GrandSlam-wiches had a hint of some kind of cinnamon ingredient that, according to the menu, should not have been there.  Add on the Kenny G and Michael McDonald on the radio the whole time and it was a complete buzz kill.  Sorry Las Vegas Denny's.  But I expected more/average."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Denny's although this visit may have changes my mind a bit. Like the kids ear free and really enjoyed my Burbon Buger.My son ate everything on his plate The entire meal represented a value I did not expect. Thak - you"}
{"text":"The honey jalape√±o siracha burger is the best burger invented! Price is super cheap compare to the amount of food your getting definitely worth going. Try to avoid rush hours because the service can be extremely slow."}
{"text":"I live in the area & have been to this Denny's many times. Sometimes better than others. This particular day I had out of town guests & we were starving. We got to Denny's around noon on a Sunday & was informed that the wait for food after seating would be approx 45 min. OK fine. We sit, & order. I ordered Cheddar & Broccoli soup to calm my growling belly since soup was already made. Well darn. Someone had burnt the soup & it tasted horrible. So I gotta wait. I ordered some breakfast meal that is made with red potatoes, 2 eggs, & cheese (minus the saausage sonce I do not eat meat) but was informed they were out of red potatoes & would need to substitute with has browns. ok.  The restaurant had cleared out but the wait for food was still 45 min? I ordered french fries which I was able to get in 30 min. (YAY my belly is happy!) But wait, why are my fries not even warm? & they tasted like they were old. Did I get someones fries that they didnt finish from earlier?? Belly is not happy. We get our meals about 50 min later. My friends eggs are slimey & need to be sent back to cook. My other friends toast is burnt. They forget my eggs with the meal. & guess what? My meal is also burnt. Thank god for 3 ice teas because I pretty much skipped the meal.  On the upside, our waitress was very kind and handled our situations very well (considering this was obviously an issue in the kitchen) Never again."}
{"text":"I was fairly certain that I had  written a review in the past.  I just cannot understand how even after remodeling that this Denny's could still be so dead yet the customer service and the staff be so darn slow. I swear to you at any given time we can go in and there MAY be three other couples or tables but yet it is so slow to get even a beverage let alone our breakfast or lunch. Until Vernon came along. The last few times that we've been in he has been our server . He's very friendly is very efficient and no matter how slow or busy the restaurant appears to be, it always seems like we are getting our food and beverages right on time without having to look around aimlessly"}
{"text":"This is disappointing. Service is okay, wait time for food is ridiculous. I am sitting here at Dennys as my family has their food for a good 10 minutes now and I still don't have my food.  I am so upset I don't even want this food..if they ever even bring it out. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this location. The employees are always friendly and fast.  Meghan was our waitress today and she was wonderful!"}
{"text":"hostess is nice, server was ehh... Managers way of greeting a table is in a rush and with no smile asking \"How is everything\" as he is rushing past your table...."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you are anything but white    Vitoria is worst manager ever and discriminated against a black customer.  She needs to be fired !! Who does she think she is ?  We are in 2016 !!     I'm reporting to corporate as well."}
{"text":"Typical Denny's food but this one had good service. It was 2am and we couldn't find any other place that was open."}
{"text":"The most dysfunctional Dennys I have ever had the displeasure of eating at. SLOWEST service from server to food. Mgmt. That doesn't care to boot. Never again!"}
{"text":"Honest truth this place is shit. The utensils where dirty, the service was horrible, and even the coffee cream smelled expired. People here were rude! I strongly suggest that this is a bad spot to come to."}
{"text":"I have been going to Denny's a lot over the years.Denny's has always been my go to place for late night eating.unfortunately with this latest experience I've had I can't say the same. I know when people get feedback on the restaurant is mostly negative. but the positive feedback is people return to the restaurant. my girlfriend and I stop in the Highland Heights, Ohio location on July 6 2014 at about 4:30Am .My girlfriend ordered the red white and blue with a sliced turkey substitute. I order a turkey sandwich with a egg fried hard and strawberry pancake puppies.When we got our food I seen the egg was running out of the my sandwich and the turkey was ice cold. The turkey was also cold on my girlfriend's plate. I sent back the sandwich. Only to have it returned with the same bread and cold meat again. We had the mgr Diane come to our table to let her know our concerns. She said she cooked my sandwich and when I explained that the same yolk soaked bread was used she denied. she was very unfriendly and unapologetic about the situation. Not to mention other tables were having trouble around us and unlike the other tables we remained calm and didn't raise our voices. This was honestly the worst restaurant experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"The absolute worst Denny's ever. I have given them multiple chances, Bc they are so close to me but every time I go there I have to wait an hour plus for food.  The manager is a jerk that only gives excuses and then gets mad when you leave."}
{"text":"I really like this Denny's. It's the standard Denny's fare, same specials and what not, same food made the same way. I always end up here late evening- around 7:30 so off peak hours- and service is great. I always get friendly waitstaff, it feels like a small diner experience here. The best thing about Denny's is the hash browns. You can't beat them anywhere. Perfectly crisp and shredded. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Dennys. Great central location, responsive staff (once you get their attention), fast service, reasonable prices.  Every time that I've been to this Dennys, I've had to wait 30 minutes to an hour but for some reason, a grand slam after a booze-filled night is the most comforting thing that I can ingest so yeah, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We tried a different Denny's, best decision we ever made. This Denny's is totally awesome, the staff and atmosphere is so relaxing. Come on over. The food is so good."}
{"text":"This has become a \"nice\" Denny's, where the place is clean and pretty, the waitstaff are extremely pleasant, the coffee refills are frequent (and the coffee will put hair on your chest), napkins are offered generously, and things pretty much go well.  I'm putting it at only 3 stars because in comparison to other places in the coffee shop/family diner world, Denny's is reliable rather than exciting. It's open at the crack of dawn so a person can tank up before early morning Walmart shopping, which is a point for \"reliable.\" The food is food. These were not the worst eggs I've ever had; they were not the best eggs. The sausage was a sausage. Whatever was supposed to be happening with the Rio Ranchero skillet happened, and it's at least genuinely spicy.  Prices outside the $2-$4-$6-$8 menu are heading upward to meet the breakfast prices of chi-chi eateries, while the quality is still staunchly middle-of-the-road -- which is a chain-wide issue, not the fault of this Denny's, but still a reason to make it a breakfast fall-back rather than a breakfast destination.  I'd do this again because Walmart's at its most bearable at 7:30 on Sunday morning, but it's better with a coupon, and I won't *not* search for more local and exciting alternatives."}
{"text":"During a vacation to Las Vegas with my kids, I was looking for a breakfast place that could get us in quickly to feed 3 moody and hungry kids.  As soon as we got in they were able to seat us and righ away take our order.  Our order was out in less than ten minutes.  They got our food order mixed up a little but fixed it right away.  This is a perfect place to eat if you are looking for a no crowed,  quick service family food place."}
{"text":"Dennys had great food and great service, how ever their crane machines are totally rigged"}
{"text":"Came here after a night of waking Fremont with some friends and I was greeted with a warm welcome and excellent customer service. The food was great. The layout is a little funky, however."}
{"text":"I will NOT go back to this Denny's. Me and some friends walk in and get seated last Saturday night. We waited about 10min for a server to approach us. It was late so we wasn't rushing them or anything. It was probably 2:30 to 3:00am. The waiter finally comes over...doesn't say hello. Goes straight into our drink orders. We place our drink orders and once he's done I ask the other 3 in my party if they are ready to place their food orders as well...they said yes. So, I asked the waiter if we can place our food order now as well...he turns his head side ways and says NO and stares me down...I said really why not...he says because he has other tables and I say it would be easier to do it all now then...he said NO AND YOUR GETTING ANOTHER WAITER...snaps his neck and walks off....Where is this acceptable behavior at? I am calling into speak to the Manager. Oh yes, I asked for a Manager on the way out because of course we didn't stay to eat there and the lady up front said there was no Manager in at the moment. Really, out of all my years as a waitress I have never known an establishment to not have a Manager on site all the time. I know its Denny's and I know it was late but come on we gotta do better then this disrespect. If you hate your job get a new one."}
{"text":"First time here. Very busy but seated quickly. Food was served promptly and hot! Very good breakfast. Good server. Will be back! Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"First time at this Dennis.  Great service.  Food was done very quick no long waits.   The waitress was very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with my parents and there's a waiter by the name of Juan and he's the best.  He's very attentive,  always making sure our drinks were full and our food was good. He is the reason why I'll keep coming back.  The food and service was excellent.  Thank you Juan for the great experience."}
{"text":"It's the little things in life that make it all worth it. Little things like ranch dressing in a ramekin, water refills, and the check. Look it: we know what we're doing... We are going to Denny's and expect shitty food. We're drunk. We just lost $20 in a machine. We want to escape. We do that by eating at Denny's. But we still expect service. Christ, you're bad at your job. We sit in a booth surrounded by unkempt tables; piles of dirty dishes left by disappointed customers who came before us. I'm sad when I realize my ketchup bottle is empty. Why is it up to me to replace it by snatching one from one of those dirty tables? Why can't you check up on us? You aren't busy... Listen: be good at what you do. Try. I'm more than happy to overtip when given the chance. You work in Las Vegas... Understand that the locals you wait on are also in some sort of service industry. All we want is someone to take care of us for half an hour. Do your fucking job."}
{"text":"We walked in the server acted like she was doing us a favor by seating us. After 10 minutes of waiting, we got up and left. No one said a word to us. Thanks anyway we'll find any other restaurant to eat in from now on."}
{"text":"I really should be giving this place one star based on their food BUT the service was so wonderful that they automatically get two extra stars! My friend and I came here extremely hungover and ordered some breakfast. Everything was soooo greasy we couldn't really eat it! My friend didn't eat hers at all but was willing to pay for it- but the waitress noticed that she didn't eat it and took it off the bill for us. My friend also had a bad night in Vegas where she lost her phone and her credit cards got canceled- so the guy at the front was really patient while she was on my cell phone trying to work out the credit card issues with her bank. They even gave me some quarters to play the video game in the front.  You can build your own skillet, which is what I did. I tried to make it healthy but the sheer amount of grease on it kinda destroyed that dream. Just a heads up if you're on a diet!"}
{"text":"Every now in then I like to be reminded of my childhood and bring my little family here, we always come for breakfast and everytime it meets my expectations. The service is great and fast, coffee is constantly flowing. This location is great."}
{"text":"The only place which was serving customers on Christmas Eve. Kudos to the staff. Awesome delicious food. Would recommend to go there whenever you wanna have a quick bite with your friends and family"}
{"text":"Mmmm this location is sort of awkward, not really near PH (where we were staying) but not really near the other attractions like M&M world or Coca Cola world..."}
{"text":"I don't want to rag on Denny's, because I love eating here.  I think this location was not the greatest.  Every time I've gone to Denny's, the service and the food has been great.  Here, not so much.  I felt like my mom and I were rushed here.   When my mom and I arrived, there were not very many people inside, no one at the front to seat us, and a man sitting that had been waiting.  We wondered and the lady at the cashier finally said something.    We had two male waiters.  One I think was in training, who did a better job than the vet.  Whenever we needed something, we asked the trainee because our other waiter never brought out what we asked for.  He didn't have many tables either, because there wasn't a lot of people in there.    I saw a picture of nachos on the menu and it looked really good, so I ordered that.  When it came out, the only thing on the plate was chips, cheese and the avocado I ordered as extra. I asked for some salsa to give it more taste, and that made it better.  My mom stated her food wasn't that good as usual.    The place seemed older, but obviously with their location, they have a ton of people coming in and out all hours of the day.  To keep it shiny would be difficult.  There were food particles in our booth.  I will go back to Denny's, but not this one in the heart of the strip.  I will stick to the one's closer to my home."}
{"text":"Go late at night, get Marshall (?...skinny, long dark haired kid) as your server and order a big ass cheeseburger. I don't remember the name of it, as it was on a menu insert and not a regular menu item...a cheeeburger with a fried egg, hashbrowns and cheese sauce on it. My God, one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had.   My friend's food was delicious as well, service was attentive and FAST...it was a packed house and everyone was having a blast.   Having survived many after-club, overflowing and understaffed Denny's during my lifetime this one was a revelation (well, as much of a revelation as a Denny's can be)."}
{"text":"This location is a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Please read carefully the following experience - as it applies to everyone not just a small group.  At 6:30am Sunday 9/24/2017 my wife, her cousin and myself stopped in this location.  We are nor from Charlotte nor NC but being Denney's we had a certain level of expectation albeit a low one.  (Let me paint this picture so you can envision this.  I am White, wife is AA as is her cousin).  So we enter the establishment, my wife approaches the hostess (PAM) and explains we would like a to go order, \"PAM\" looks me up and down, then my wife and cousin, notices a \"Saints\" shirt (Panthers/Saints game weekend)  asks rather disdainful whether we were Saints fans, once we affirmed this we were told \"We can't serve you, no Saints fans allowed\".    After a short moment of disbelief we all turned around to leave and stated that if this is the case we don't want to patronize such an establishment.  (We were already not comfortable with the hostesses reaction to us and the way she looked at us upon entering)  as we left \"PAM\" the hostess followed us out saying she was just joking.  Well it was not a joke.  We left, and while leaving \"PAM\" stood outside ranting something about us.  We drove across the street to a gas station and while there I called and spoke to \"WILLIAM\" the shift manager, and while explaining the experience he stated \"Well that's too bad\" and hung up the phone.  I immediately returned to the location, went inside and asked to speak to him at which point I was told he had just left.  Really?  the coward was probably hiding in the back like all phone hero's do...... I took a picture of the Franchisee information that was posted and later called them - they have not returned my call......  To further exacerbate the situation (sorry PAM and WILLIAM\" that may be to big a word for you to understand) when we were leaving, \"PAM\" told my wife that if she had something to say get out of the car.  (Simple minded little moron made a terrible mistake) needless to say no one got hurt thanks to self control, but if words could cut she would have been bloody.  Moral to this encounter - the absolute worst Denney's we have ever encountered.  The staff (PAM and WILLIAM at least) are unfit for basic employment and if it were in my power they would have been terminated on the spot.  The Franchisee RWDT Foods, Inc. 470-222-4275 - Stone Mountain, GA are just as culpable as their staff for ignoring calls regarding this incident.  Denney's corporate office took my call and have opened an investigation into this location and are to contact the franchisee.  Hopefully that will accomplish positive some change -   Final thought - these workers are only responding to the style of leadership they are exposed to.   \"My research debunks the myth that many people seem to have . . . that you become a leader by fighting your way to the top. Rather, you become a leader by helping others to the top. Helping your employees is as important as, and many times more so than, trying to get the most work out of them.\" - William Cohen in The Stuff of Heroes: The Eight Universal Laws of Leadership.  Challenge to the franchisee - Learn to become a \"Servant Leader\" and others will follow."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest Denny's fan. It's always been the place to go in the middle of the night after you drank too much and the food is \"decent\" because you are lacking a sense of logic. Today my boyfriend and I had the choice between Chili's, Denny's, or random fast food. I never liked Chili's all that much and fast food is always last on my list so we stopped in to this location for a late lunch.   We were seated in a booth next to a mother and her daughter, with an older gentleman further away. For some reason the man and teen started talking about a newspaper and this turned into them chit-chatting the entire time, which annoyed the mom so much she actually asked the girl to stop talking and eat her burger and cleared her throat several times when the daughter continued to yap. A very awkward albeit hilarious restaurant moment. The topics ranged from Lord of the Ring books, Twilight and the writer living somewhere in AZ, ghosts and dogs that bark at walls/ghosts, and a whole lot of other fairy crap. I'm only writing about this because it was literally all we heard for 80% of the time we spent there, and it was something you couldn't ignore because they were talking so loud. We would of asked to move to the other side of the restaurant but it seemed like there was only one waitress and everyone was grouped together to make it easier for her I'm guessing.   The only thing that distracted us from all the noise was the food when it came out. I had the lemon tilapia with veggies and coleslaw, my bf ordered pancakes and buffalo wraps (so random!) From the first bite I was alarmed, in such a good way. I've never had such wonderful food at Denny's! The fish was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right, the veggies were fresh, and the coleslaw was your average recipe but still done well. I had a bite of the pancakes and buffalo wrap both, pancakes A+ and the wrap was good, nothing spectacular. It came with tortilla chips and salsa that to our surprise were also very good considering where we were eating. The water was eh but not many restaurants serve water to my liking (except California Pizza Kitchen, yum) but our waitress was quick to keep them full. The manager came over once and apologized for interrupting, funny because it wasn't her causing all the commotion during the meal, and asked how everything tasted. We let her know how we felt and she gave me a pat on the back saying she was very happy we were enjoying it so much. I don't know what it is about sweet older ladies patting you on the back but it just feels so nice and takes you back in time to when you were a kid and had no worries or cares at all.   Enough of that cheese fest, the bill came out to $20 and I have a feeling it would have been double that at Chili's with half the satisfaction upon leaving.  Another perk is that outside the doors they have a redbox. We have only seen them at grocery stores or pharmacies and gas stations, to see one outside of Denny's was pretty nifty and we decided to rent a movie for tonight."}
{"text":"Typical Denny's, but the service is exceptional.  The waitress who served me (Frances) was amazing.  It's rare that someone makes such a lasting impression, but she definitely deserves some kudos which made me compelled to leave this review.  Do yourself a favor and ask to sit in her section."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst customer service,they look miserable working!! And they're so freaking rude ghetto ass employees!!!"}
{"text":"Worse service ever!! Went to Dennys on Euclid Ave and 91 for dinner and won't ever go back!! First we get our drinks and husbands coffee cup was dirty with what looked like lipstick. We told the waitress and she had the nerve to say sure that wasn't his. Ha ha lady not funny. They had the air conditioner on so high we had to ask them to turn it down. Other people moved tables to because of the air blowing to cold. On top of it waitress never came back to ask us for drink refills. After an hour of waiting for our food and still not getting it we got up and left without paying for our drinks!! Oh did I mention there was like noone in the restaurant. Will never return!!"}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly staff. Convenient location right on the strip.   Food was quick and served piping hot. Nice to pay Denny's prices for a meal instead of Vegas prices."}
{"text":"We went to Denny's on Sunday for brunch. There were five of us. We have to wait 10 minutes to get a table because they were very busy.  I ordered the full Benny dish. It was okay, but the eggs were overcooked. My sister said that her skillet dish were too greasy. My brother like his dish, but it was missing his toast.  Would we go back? Maybe. Denny's is a famous chain that is attractive to out of towners. I wouldn't go back because there are so many other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"gay Denny's gets 4 stars just for atmosphere, but as katie S. points out, the service is always atrocious. I'm sure staff is primarily prioritized by demographic, so service skill is secondary."}
{"text":"Typical Denny's. Nice and attentive waitstaff. Prime location outside of touristy area."}
{"text":"Not bad, not amazing. Food is good, portions good, just the restaurant didn't feel warm and welcoming. A little dark, could be a bit cleaner. Didn't like the seating area in the corner near the kitchen. Leo was a very good waiter."}
{"text":"Denny's is the best! Whenever I need a quick breakfast before work I'll just call my order in and pick it up. They have plenty of options to keep everyone satisfied."}
{"text":"Tried this Denny's location on Memorial Day. Met some friends for breakfast. We were able to quickly get a table. Food was good, service was good..just nicking them a star because we had to wait for drink refills for a little while."}
{"text":"No complaints. Food was decent. Service was good. Was able to get a table without an issue."}
{"text":"Pretty quick service when they aren't too busy. The food is very good but the prices are a little too high for my liking. The makes server that has been here for ages is the best one and he always is enthusiastic and happy to be at work."}
{"text":"Very bad. Service extremely slow.  Forgot silverware for table to begin with, when they came, one place set dirty.   An order of pancakes, had a leaf of  cooked lettuce between them.   Place overall dirty."}
{"text":"Customer service is great friendly efficient but the glass a guy at first was dirty sure they changed it and the densest never changed very happy and helpful. The atmosphere is nice fir it being attached to a mall   Has ample seating and surprisingly a good view as well  The milkshake was delicious and so much whip Not the best dinner not the best Denny's"}
{"text":"A long wait just like any other Denny's i've been too. an even longer wait to get your food too. portions are decent, enough to fill you up. I got some scramble thing they sound really good at that moment after a night out of getting F--ked up at TAO nightclub.   A lot of people come here to eat and its actually a pretty small dennys, sadly. also, people, no alcohol is allowed here [ my buddies didnt get the memo since we all walked in with a cup filled with something ]. our server betty i believe was really nice. she was awesome with the service, that made up for the wait time for our food."}
{"text":"they have changed and updated there menu to include yummy holiday items and fluffy new pancakes. kimmie was amazing and tended to all of our needs. i came in starving and have left quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Very, very nice staff. Busy on Friday and Saturday nights/early mornings, but by 6 AM it has calm down and the atmosphere is very quiet and relaxed. I definitely recommend stopping in for breakfast or dinner :-)"}
{"text":"Walk in gave my name, there were seats available, still had to wait 20 minutes. Waitress came got our drinks. Only giving us half of our drinks still waiting. We haven't seen our new waitress. Now 10 minutes later the same waitress  showed up. Sounding confused,  this Danny's  is slow, disorganized and forget your here to eat.  Not sure they forget to take your order. Or short staffed, so if you have an hour to spare just for them to take your order this is the PLACE. 40 Minutes later still waiting."}
{"text":"Sooo badd... like..soo baddd... Extremely under staffed, on a Sunday? At Noon? Like really... no Host btw....we submitted our name to the Waitress, who lost the list 5 mins later, because she had to work her tables.. other interchanging waitresses made different lists with different people... Needless to say it took us 25mins to be sat..once Sat we waited 15mins, b4 the Manager, not a waiter, handed us menus and gave us waters.. 10 mins later a waitress, very pleasant, took our orders..1hr 20 mins our food came out slowly.....1 person at a time...smh... AND IT WAS COLD!!!...   HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE... 4 thumbs down"}
{"text":"Very disappointed for a dennys.  Slow service but semi professional. Cold food after a long wait. They should have paid us. Won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. Asked for water for the table 3 times and still never got water. Had to get up and ask for creamer after my coffee had already got cold because I had already asked for creamer and hadn't received it. Waitress had a bad attitude and mixed up our order with her other table, mind you she only had 3 tables to wait on. If I could give zero stars I would. Never going to come back and make sure everyone I know is aware of how poorly managed this location is."}
{"text":"First off I love Denny's. After heading IHOP and having a wait time of 45+ minutes, we decided to come to Denny's in the Tahiti Village. This particular location I really liked because it was not crowded at all. (Saturday 12:30am) the service was speedy and efficient. I called to reserve a table for 10 and waited only 10 minutes from the time we got in. Ashley was very courteous over the phone and Alexis was superb as our waitress. We were greeted with genuine smiles from the moment we stepped in and Alexis kept it up until we left. Thank you for serving us today, Alexis!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this American icon. There are plenty of great menu items to choose from, most of which, you remember eating as a kid.  In this recent visit, we were seated right away, order placed and food brought to our table in less than 7 minutes.  Wait staff was very polite and friendly.  I rarely give 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's just a Denny's, nothing special, but....  Fast, friendly service, unlike may other Denny's I've visited.  Consistent food quality. I know what will be coming out of the kitchen when I order a meal at this Denny's. The Chicken fried steak is decent, so is the Buffalo chicken sandwich.  ...and hey... I find them to be WAY better than the IHOP at Alma School & Elliot"}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!!! AMAZING RENO!!!!!! But really...they did renos?   All fun aside I came here with the usual crew (Amanda V. and Adam T.) for a early afternoon breakfast. Had an entertaining waiter, food was good and what we ordered (had this problem a few times over the years at other Denny's locations). I had strawberry pancakes with a strawberry lemonade, the lemonade is awesome. all said and done good food at a decent price."}
{"text":"This place actually felt like a legitimate diner when I entered. The waitresses were terrific. Both of them made things easy. The problem was the restrooms which emanated the smell of urine into the entire left side of the restaurant. A cloud of trucker's pee.   So gross.  I do not have a great sense of smell but even I was overwhelmed by it. I mentioned this to one of the waitresses who says they've told the manager. But I doubt that anything is being done about it. Otherwise the food was well, Denny's. Pancakes or like birthday cake. Bacon very crispy but a day old. Uninspired greasy eggs. I never know why I go in dennys.  I only found new reasons not to in Medina."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars but the management sucks!  I visit here usually every Friday for dinner with my boyfriends parents and tonight the service was awful. It took about 10 minutes for us to order and get our drinks. We were waiting about 45 minutes for our food, and when the food came out it was cold. The only ones to blame is the management. NOT the waitresses.   Rachel wasn't our server tonight like she normally is. That girl works her butt off! She is always amazing and incredibly friendly. You can tell she's stressed out but a smiles always remains on her face. She definitely deserves 5 stars, but I can't give Dennys the same recognition as the management needs to get their shit together. The past five or six times I've visited Rachel is usually the only the on the floor and is running around doing everything. Really!? It's a Friday night, have more people helping the girl out. Poor management..."}
{"text":"Everything I could ever expect from a good dining service, Manuelle provided great service and the food was hot. Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Denny's is usually 'hit or miss' for me.  Lately, the service has been on the slow side, and my eggs were very undercooked the last time I was there.  My toast was also burnt, and it took forever to bring me a new one.  I also had an unexpected, heated exchange of words with a most unsavory, neanderthal, ZZ Top bearded yahoo in the parking lot, who saw it was his life's mission to inform me that I should 'buy American', as I got into my far superior foreign car!   Now, i've always given this place the benefit of the doubt over the years, since it's been a longtime local fixture, and I like to give my business to local establishments whenever possible.  But I think i'm going to lay low for a while and frequent some of my other favorite local breakfast joints just down the road, where I see more Japanese and German cars parked, and where civility still reigns supreme!  UPDATE: June 2016.  NEVER again!  OK, the interior renovation as of late (last few years) looks nice, but the service here is a JOKE!  It took forever for us to be recognized and given drinks, and forever to have our order taken and brought out to us!  You are much better off going to a local diner than this SLOWWW moving joint!  How can Denny's stay in business with such pathetic service?!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent. As far as Denny's goes, it is top notch! The servers here are friendly and the food is fast. I did have a bad experience here and the GM was very fast at correcting the mistake. Although, I am not a huge fan of this location because EVERY single time I come here, people are begging for change and follow me out to my car. I wouldnt suggest coming here alone at night because of this."}
{"text":"Stopped in to eat here while on a road trip to Texas.  I had the chicken fingers and it was ok.   Nothing special. Food was ok and service was good though."}
{"text":"Dry hamburger patty with a dry bun. The service was slow and I saw a couple staff members dancing around as I waited for my check. They weren't too attentive and it was just bad service. Definitely didnt leave a tip."}
{"text":"The server didn't greet us for 20 mins. Didn't bring the drinks for 10 mins and even at that point only brought some of them. Appetizer was dropped off at the table with no silverware to eat it with. Last of drinks came after the appetizer but no straw was given for it. Half an hour later the food arrives: One of the dishes was not what we ordered, another was incomplete, the bacon was undercooked, the toast was given with no butter, and pancakes were given without syrup. The server was nice but rarely came by and when she did she wouldn't ask how things were or even stick around long enough to let us ask for what was missing."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. What is there to say? (I've heard they have awesome toast, with whipped butter...but I digress.) Met up with the extended family here one lunchtime last week. They ordered for me, via my text from 5-10 minutes away. When I arrived, my food arrived moments later. It was a very basic BLT, not top quality ingredients, but they did a good job with what they were working with. The staff is pleasant and efficient, and the place was tidy. So there you go."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't rate the food because after being seated we sat for twenty minutes while the staff who was not busy (only two other tables) stood around and talked to each other.  We did however have an amazing meal and great service at Dukes, after we walked out, which is right behind Dennys."}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice and friendly. Food was ok. I wouldn't eat it if I wasn't hungry. I asked to add avocado, chef put me like a quarter of a fruit. I asked why only three pieces and she went to ask for more but he said he would charge extra. I took it anyway but didn't eat cause it was green. My dish supposed to have mushrooms. I found few small over fried pieces. 5 stars for waitress, 1 for chef"}
{"text":"Visited for breakfast. Lines moved quickly and is worth the wait. The menu is vast and food is tasty.  If you looking for a good dinner experience then this is a definite must"}
{"text":"I used to have breakfast there, cause it is closed to work, today i have a bad experience, our waitress was very rude, i ordered only the drinks than i cancelled and leave dennys... i didn't pay attention to her name tag but she has red hair! Never coming back to that location!!"}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE!!!!!! been going here and on off since i was a teenager which has gotta be for over 15years. Just moved back to cleveland last year and i stopped in about 3 or 4times so far and everytime has been TERRIBLE. I will never go back here again after tonight. went there for a late night breakfast.......the waitress made us wait forever even though she only had 2 tables, she then greeted us and rambled through the list of the ten things they were out of because they don't get food deliveries until wednesday (today was monday.......so nothing for 2more days!?!?!?). She took forever on their dumb computer system seemed like she didnt know how to operate it. She couldn't do a substitution for me cuz she didn't know how to do it on their system. I ordered the belgian waffle slam and the waffle tasted like crap....seemed like they just heated up a frozen waffle. the bacon was old n cold.....tasted like it was cooked that morning.  My gf ordered  a sampler which was the only halfway decent thing we got, she also ordered the country fried steak with their smoked cheddar potatoes which tasted like old dried potatoes that had been sitting around for a day or two. Idk if they changed food distributors or what cuz the food has gone way down hill. The cooks you can tell don't care about their jobs cuz all the food is either overdone or underdone or cooked wrong. The waitress was not good, besides all the times she made us wait and messed up the order and forgot to bring us stuff she ended on a high note by ringing us and the other table out backwards so she had to get the manager to reverse it all which took an extra 10minutes which woulda been fine if the food didn'/t make me and my gf so sick we just wanted to leave. The management must not care because the place looked horrible, i saw drips going down the sides of the booths from people washing em down but not drying it. The tables and menus were all nasty. The owner must not care about the place or the customers otherwise he'd be on top of food supply orders and the nasty appearance of the place, the lack of cleanliness, poor staffing. I imagine he just sits back and cashes a check.........my dennys visits this year have been the WORST DINING EXPERIENCES OF MY ADULT LIFE. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"The server, Coty was attentive and polite.  My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch and service was fast. Parking was easy and staff was friendly. Would recommend this location to any of my friends."}
{"text":"This place was gross, the review b4 me must have been the last time they CLEANED. The employees were just as rude, they sat my hubby and I at a dirty booth and the food was gross plus they got the order wrong. Do yourself a favor don't come here :))"}
{"text":"Crappy customer service, food takes forever and staff is rude, messy and unprofessional. Save your money!!! Our table was Dirty and wet, we waited 30mins for food to come out and 50 additional mins for a banana split, before leaving. \"Dylan\" the waiter got pissed we decided to leave after 50mins of waiting  and stated \"We'll We're busy here, you're not the only ones!\" Apparently multitasking, paying attention to detail and providing  customer service is too large of a task.  Hmm.. he's going far in life. I will not return. Dennys you and your staff are getting classy, missing teeth, wrinkled clothes, and attitudes... hmm every drop outs dream job!!"}
{"text":"Entered and were seated right away.  Server came promptly and took our order.  The food came out in good time.  It was lukewarm. Nothing was hot. Scrambled eggs were dry, hash browns were good, bacon were 2 dried up pieces that tasted like soap. Pancakes were sort of burned on the edges and were lukewarm as well.  Pretty disappointing.  I remember when Denny's had the best breakfast in town and people would stand in line to eat there.  But, don't bother now. When we tried to pay the cashier, a server walked up and rudely ask the cashier question as we are waiting.  The whole thing was a waste of time....."}
{"text":"One of the worst places to eat do not go here this place is nasty disgusting the ass(t)manager Erica Sanchez  is rude unprofessional crippled hobbling around the restaurant in a nasty demeaner.  She should not be allowed to serve food to dogs. The place has bugs/Roaches and other flying insects.   The staff seems to be afraid of this women even the general manager is incompetent for hiring someone like her.    If you need a good bowel movement then eating at this place will flush u out.   Becarful sitting in the seats you may get bed bugs.   Saw several employees smoking dope out back including the manager.   This place needs to closed down."}
{"text":"We came in and had a 5 minute wait. The place was empty.... our waitress was really nice and our food was out quickly. What else can I say? It's Denny's. The food was clearly microwaved but wasn't terrible. The coffee was burnt, I didn't finish it. Bottom line, would we come back? Maybe, this isn't the worst Denny's but there is better breakfast places in LV."}
{"text":"Bulldoze this place and make a parking lot. Seriously just had the WORST POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE at this Denny's. walk in at 11:00 PM on a Friday night. Restaurant isn't even 20% full. There are 7 of us. After standing there about 10 minutes we are greeted with \"we will seat you shortly\" and she then proceeds to cash out 3 guests. Finally we tell her 7 people and she tells us it will be a few minutes. We then watch her clean off a large table for us. She then disappears. 5 minutes later a different employee comes over and tells us that there is \"one server on the floor\" and it's going to be \"a while\" before we can be seated. Again, restaurant is not even 20% full. There are at least 5 waitresses wandering around. Apparently 4 of them must have been off at 11. Meanwhile, I worked at a Dennys all through high school and college and we didn't get to leave at our scheduled time if it was still busy. Clearly these people have no work ethic and no customer service skills.  With all due respect, no way in hell am I waiting to be seated at Denny's. You people already wasted 20 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Where is management?  This place should be a gold mine. Instead it's a land mine. Get a clue Denny's. Epic fail."}
{"text":"Although this Denny's location is in need of some dire repairs/renovations It still provides good food and good service I come to this location sometimes simply because the other ones in Tempe and Scottsdale are usually packed on Saturday & Sunday mornings The service can be hit or miss here but usually great and tentative The food is the same  The thing that kinda gets to me is just the look of the place I hope to see this one get renovated eventually Perhaps that could boost their business a little bit..."}
{"text":"4:30am on a Sunday. Build your own grand slam: biscuit was cold and dry. Eggs were overcooked. Bacon was good. Hash browns were seasoned perfectly for once. Coffee was decent although I had to remind the waitress to refill my cup. Food took long considering the restaurant was not busy."}
{"text":"Breakfast is good, glad they have 9 grain pancakes available! Didn't like coming here before because of weak coffee, but they changed it and then we came all the time, until 2 days ago coffee tasted like water, hard to understand because supposed to be made same way all the time unless adjusted water ratio to get more bang for buck???? But will try again because I enjoy breakfast and service"}
{"text":"Not even worthy of one star!! Service sucked royally, after waiting an hour due to our classless slob of a waitress forgetting to put our order in. After receiving our cold food, the waitress asks if the food is cold to touch?? Are you EFFIN KIDDING ME. Needless to say had to go home and cook my own breakfast  . Stay away from place unless you want some crackhead serving your food.  Worst Denny's I have been too!!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this particular Denny's if your 30 or younger. This place smells like old people and death, (its Sun City) and for some reason the weirdest people are always hanging out outside the place or sitting inside; it creeps me out. It also needs a good cleaning, I always get a sticky table.  The staff and waitresses are friendly and the food is good but that's it."}
{"text":"Chose Denny's for a very late (1:30pm) Sunday brunch. No wait. Quickly greeted and served. I ordered the half size of Moon Over My Hammy. It was just the right amount of food for me, and the hash browns were delicious! Only thing lacking was Frank's Red Hot :-) Son and husband very pleased with their meals, can't remember the names but see pic. Patron next to us gave us $5 off $20 check, so our total came to $16! Would go back again for a casual meal."}
{"text":"I just get nachos. They're awesome. Server was awesome too. Nice job Dennys Indian Bend!!!"}
{"text":"Orders uber. Restaurant messes up the order. I'm missing so many items and some of the stuff was made wrong. Can't contact uber and restaurant won't fix problem. Don't uber eats and just go to IHOP."}
{"text":"Food is always great.  The service is hit or miss depending on what day and time you're in.  Nothing better than their chocolate shakes after a night out and the people watching is SPECTACULAR in this particular Denny's"}
{"text":"I came to Denny's for a late night dinner with my friends and Tara took such good care of us. Her honesty and energy really stood out for us. We came in and got sat immediately and the food came out soon after. We ended up trying two of the skillets and the salmon and the veggie fit fare skillet and we loved both of them. Tara's confidence and product knowledge allowed us to feel comfortable and enjoy our meal tonight. Thank you Tara, we will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"From the very beginning of our awesome experience here, we were greeted with warm smiles. This DENNYS is new and my girlfriend and I live right down the street and we wanted to hop on by since we love DENNYS. We were pleasantly surprised by how put together and modern this classic diner is. Everyone has said hi to my girlfriend and I and it seems so genuine; it's honestly refreshing. The food comes out and we were blown away! My chicken tenders and mozzarella sticks were spot on and my girlfriends fries and sandwich were perfect as well. And to top the entire thing off, we were given a complimentary bag of goodies for visiting so early in this DENNYS opening week. It was an awesome experience and this location has just bought two lifetime customers!"}
{"text":"Big fat zero. I mean, it's Denny's so wasn't expecting much, but I called an order in Sunday aprox. 10am ( keep in mind I live 2.4 miles away from this location), I finally left their parking lot at 11:30am. Paid 35$ for breakfast that was inedible and orders were STILL WRONG after they made the order wrong TWICE. It was so frustrating. I am not into reviewing, but this will hopefully help someone else make a better choice before wasting your time and money.  I mean, who screws up breakfast basically 3 times??? Oh and maybe even a small acknowledgment would have been nice?? I actually felt bad after a while, don't think they knew any better... it was sad...oh and wtf, they don't deserve any star... gross...."}
{"text":"Open 24/7, located in Motel Village in the NW, Denny's is a great place to eat  when you're feeling hungry just because.  My sister and I are from a small town in Manitoba so Denny's is SO COOL to us.  I lived here for about 4 years and my little sister just moved here in September.  She has never been to Denny's before, but heard about it.  After the fair at Sunridge, it was about 10:15pm and we were craving sushi.. but most places close at 11pm and we feel bad for coming in late so we pondered for another place to eat.    \"Have you been to Denny's?\" my sister asks. I told her I have, but haven't in a looong time... \"Its open 24/7 and has breakfast, lunch and dinner on the menu!!\" I said. SOLD!! Denny's it was.  When we arrived, the front parking lot was full, but I remembered there was a parking lot in the back.  We got sat immediately and started looking at the menu. \"COOL!! BREAKFAST!!\" my sister says.  Its funny how some people can be so amazed that places serve breakfast any time of the day! I, myself think its awesome too!  So I ordered the classic benedict, half and it comes with a side of potatoes.  My sister ordered a choose your own, and she chose sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs and grated potatoes.    The food was very mediocre, but I mean what do we expect?  The sausages were dry and the bacon was solid.  But my benedict was not so bad! :)   So pretty much....Its Denny's, honestly..what do you expect?  Its not the greatest but its A-OK!"}
{"text":"Is a Chef in training cooking here at night?.  Stopped by expecting same ole breakfast fare.  Ordered the Deluxe Skillet.  It was upscale, it was yummy and it was a huge portion so I took enough home for a second meal tomorrow.  I sent my compliments back to the Chef something I've never ever done at Denny's.  Service was great also."}
{"text":"Sub-par to NONE -- absolutely amazing!   My fiance and I have dinned at some of the most expensive and exclusive restaurants you can think of ....none of them had better service than this Denny's! Shocking right?   Our server was Donald D. and it was 3 am on November 29, 2013... He was quick, efficient, friendly and had overall a great sense of hospitality.   My fiance had the Banana with Pancake breakfast, I had the Philly Omelet, and we shared a order of pancake puppies. All of which came out hot and promptly.. As for the pancake puppies, my hubby wanted the regular and I wanted the red velvet...so what did Donald D. do? He gave us half and half as a surprise!  When we ordered our drinks we wanted iced vanilla coffee (not on the menu) but he made it for us..He was just fantastic...I've read the reviews and I don't if the negativity is due to other servers or what.. but you visit here ask for Donald D.!   This was probably the 2nd or third time we've dinned at Denny's (the first in Daytona - it was across from our hotel) We will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas and hope to have him has our server again!   We can be a bit difficult to accommodate but he did it and made us fans of Denny's - so thank you Donald D.!"}
{"text":"Always great service even during a Sunday afternoon right in between breakfast and lunch. I've been here a couple times during that busy period and have always left satisfied. The longest we have waited for a table has been 20 minutes or so. The service probably makes the food seem 10 times better."}
{"text":"Ordered online cause I had a surgery and didn't feel like cooking. Picked up the order, drove five minutes home and it was ALL wrong. Ordered scrambled eggs..got a slimy omelette. Ordered sausage..got bacon. Ordered wheat toast..got white. I'm done. I called and asked what to make of it. The 12-yr old hostess told me to bring it back, \"Hun\"! I told her \"make it correctly and I'll come and swap, \"Hun!\" She said I had to return the other one first. I hung up!! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Horrible service if I could I would give it zero stars! Legit just sat there waiting for the waiter who never came. Was there for about a hour and the waiter didn't even come to ask use what drinks we wanted. Ended up going to mcdonalds. Don't come here save your time."}
{"text":"I give one star there dennys to go! Just don't do it there confirmation email gave me the wrong address to the Wynn Resort Las Vegas and I drove around not able to get proper directions after calling them on the phone. I come in pick up my food they pulled out one on tray someone warm and the rest of my food was cold. Then I get back to my room NO SILVERWARE. Picture your kids just wanting to eat there pancakes and syrup in your room wth no silverware after driving around for 45mins them waiting hungry for me to get back! I got brushed off cause I already paid online! Terrible Service! Avoid unless it's the only place left on earth to eat!"}
{"text":"If I could give a -5 I would we went there tonight for dinner and took 40 min still had not received our food and the waitress sacked never came to see if we needed drinks and we're told they only have one cook ok no problem there we understood and we're told he was cooking them in the order he got them but the ladies who came in after us got food before us! Finally enough was enough we walked out bad service Oh wait we didn't get any!"}
{"text":"Awesome service...food was good...funny I was at a restaurant the night before where it cost me 140.00 for dinner and the service sucked badly. Ok its dennys its not gourmet,but frankly it was as I expected and the service was 5 star..."}
{"text":"Id give the food a star, maybe 2 stars but the service, probably closer to 4 stars.  Which is why im leveling it at 3 stars. We went in very late like...2-3am late on a saturday night. It was fairly slow and only one server but our server, Bart, was rushing around from table to table and more then friendly. Most people working graveyards at places have the attitude like they dont want to be there, but he was energetic and happy which made up for the shitty food (we didnt even complain). He works there most nights apparently so chances are you won't be too disappointed if its a late night Dennys stop. Now as for the food...we got the bacon and cheddar fries...and there was barely enough cheese on them to taste, then they forgot the tomatoes on my sandwich, but my friend did enjoy her burger, I just don't know if its enough to ever order the same things from here. Next time, I think breakfast may be the better option."}
{"text":"If you cute, you know I'll be back. Haha!  All jokes aside, this place is standard. The steak here isn't world class Michelin star but it gets the job done. The eggs are always cooked proper at least. The cleanliness can be questionable given the time of day but it's decent. Denny's is an all-American place for all-American eats."}
{"text":"If you get the waiter Dylan run!!! Worst waiter ever!!! Took about an hour to get our food out and never checked back in. Not to mention all three orders were wrong!!!!"}
{"text":"Denny's is the Jerry Springer of food and has a reputation for lunacy. I use this location as a late-night work spot on the East Side. Power plugs in every booth and good wifi. Staff is professional and efficient. And there are very few crazies that come in. Many of the late-night folks come from a later shift at Progressive nearby or are regulars.   The food is Denny's food. What are you going to do? But this Denny's is a good choice for a late-night stop. It's not out of control."}
{"text":"I had an awesome pancake breakfast with ice cappuccino coffee and it was delicious. My server Julie was fantastic and very friendly. If you need a friendly smile with your breakfast then ask to be seated at her table and she'll be more than happy to accommodate your party. Thanks Denny's."}
{"text":"Ya know, I've come to this Denny's on and off since moving to Phoenix several years ago.  I usually only frequent this location and one in Tempe.  I'm not really sure when it changed.  Hubs and I stopped for breakfast.  We looked at the line @ Matt's (I know there IS no comparison but the line was SOOOOOOOOOOOO long) and turned around to get one of the worst tasting meals and worst service experiences I've had in a long time.    Now, I understand something going wrong with your order now and again.  But seriously, our waitress was training someone!!!!!  An order was taken and then we were left to fend for ourselves.  Finally another waitress named Crystal (ask for HER if you dare go) stopped by and filled our coffee.  We then waited...and waited.  We saw the cooks working and putting food out that just sat under the lamps.  When we got our grand slams the only thing slightly warm were the eggs.  Sausage?  Stone cold.  Bacon: frigid.  Pancakes, laughable.  And when the manager stopped by?  Let's just say that he had a very condescending attitude.  He was basically like; \"well, what do you want me to do about it?\"  Um, manage your people effectively!  Live up to the customer service standards expected of you!  Figure it out.  My husband pretty much put him in his place by giving a detailed description of several things he'd seen done wrong since our arrival.  He offered us ONE comped meal.  Bill still came to $15 for one breakfast and drinks.  Yikes.  For this kind of money I will stand in line at Matt's and know that eventually I'll get food worth having!"}
{"text":"Just been open for about 4 weeks. Very friendly and good food! Love the new look of the building. Had the new pancakes (raspberry/white choc) so Good!"}
{"text":"Better than most dennys in this area...service was ok...and surprisingly dead at 8 in the morning...so same food less wait..."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast this morning and had a wonderful server ask for Nikki best service with a smile and food came out so quick I would recommend this location to anyone ."}
{"text":"Par experience considering it was a Denny's in a casino. The pancake puppies were to DIE for though. Definitely try them while you can. the wait service was decent and the food, well it's a Denny's..."}
{"text":"Most of the times I've been to this Denny's the service was great. But a few days ago it was horrible. Our waitress had such an attitude with our table it was only 2 of us. I had to repeatedly ask for water, she never asked how we were doing, the food came out bad and she gave us our check a few minutes after we received our food. I would understand if the restaurant was packed but it was around 9ish so it was pretty quiet. I understand that maybe she was having a bad day but at least a smile would of been nice."}
{"text":"I pulled an all-nighter.  I have NOT done this since college, and back then, it was for academic reasons.  I was out clubbing/gambling with 2 girlfriends and around 3:30 a.m., I was ready to call it quits.  One of my friends still wanted to gamble.  The other insisted that we go back to the club.  We ended up dancing 'til closing time - 4 a.m.  After chatting it up with 2 guys that we had met in the club, it was decided that we needed food.  Destination?  Denny's.  I could not believe I was doing this.  I was now guilty of the late night/early morning Denny's visit.  It actually was not as bad as I thought it might be.  Our waitress was SUPER nice (I had a bad feeling she would be bitter and mean to us for staying out so late).  One of my friends ordered 2 moons over my hammie, and I'm pretty sure one of the reasons she ordered that dish was simply to say it.  My body is not used to intaking food at the 5 a.m. hour, so I just ordered a hot chocolate.  It actually really hit the spot.  If I ever find myself out late again in Vegas, I will not hesitate to drop into this Denny's.  Based on how exhausted I was after this adventure, I really hope that I do not have to though!"}
{"text":"i came in on a monday night wanting pancakes and hashbrowns with a friend. When i came in the store looked old and i kind of regretted coming here, but with in seconds a woman with a stripped shirt sat us and got our drinks. and our server britany took our order and was very friendly. The food was out super quick and our drinks were never empty. The place looks old but the service and food were so good i couldnt help but give this frumpy dennys 5 stars. Everyone was so nice."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Not ever close to what the pictures or commercial presented. Not to mention 45 minute wait and high delivery charge."}
{"text":"I know a lot of us had been to Denny's on Gilbert and Germann. Have to post this coz I am so disgusted with the service. Ok, our server was fine, no problem with that. The food, as always, came in after over half an hour - it's a Sunday brunch, so they're swamped. The coffee mug was dirty and heavily stained. I ordered medium-rare steak, and what did I get? Almost RAW, bloody fresh piece of meat!! Judge for yourself! I did not complain coz I don't want to make a scene, nor for them to recook coz the kids are starving at this point. Sorry I'm unable to post the pic, but IT WAS DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"What was I thinking! I knew we should of went by the store and bought a power bar and a water instead...Here is a tip...avoid Denny's go hungry! What the heck me and a work partner called 3 top rated places on Yelp for breakfast and all where closed? BTW the area around the airport not nice...I would get out of the town a little bit.This Denny's is connected to a truck stop so that should of threw up another red flag but the fact that one stomach wall just ate the other we were desperate.   I ordered off of their fresh and fit menu which sounded ok, but the fact that it was drowned in butter was like an oxi moron! The only time Denny's was good to eat at was when I was much younger(not stating my age) and very very late at night. Unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice. Which is also a place I would not want to ever go back to."}
{"text":"I never had a case of food poisoning before. This was by far the most horrendous experience I have ever had. Nothing like missing New Year's Eve because of someone else's incompetence. I will never eat at another Denny's as long as I live.  The manager promised I would receive a call regarding my condition, and more than 24 hours later my phone hasn't rung. Rest assured, I will be calling the dept of Heath. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the country fried steak and eggs today. I haven't been this way for a while. It appears there have been some staffing changes but the service is still excellent. The place was packed this beautiful Sunday morning. Unsure if this is the norm as this is the first morning trip I've made here.  Overall, country fried steak and eggs came within 10 minutes and was excellent :)"}
{"text":"We go here every Saturday and have been for over 3years now. We love the staff and service. They are almost like family and the food is always good...hot and fast"}
{"text":"First my coffee cup had lipstick on it, then I ordered my bacon extra, extra crispy. It came out so bad it hardly looked cooked. When I pointed it out to the waitress she asked if I wanted it crisper than that. I was able to roll it up.  She asked if i wanted it microwaved. She took it back to be cooked more and I started to eat the scrambled eggs which were not cooked all the way and the hash browns weren't warm either. By time I was done eating as much as the eggs that were done the bacon still hadn't been delivered to me."}
{"text":"Myself and my boyfriend have been coming to this location for 4 years. In some cases 3 times a day. Now we love to cook for ourselves. And we enjoy our home very much. We come here for the food, and the service.   Its a funny thing, service. In order to recieve good or great service all you need, is to be friendly and positive and not a snobby asshole. Neat concept, right?  The staff here knows us pretty well by now, especially management, and we have our favorite waitresses, Karin, Crystola that always treat us like family and enjoy a conversation with us.   We've ventured into here at all times of the day and night. I think the only time I had a bit of a complaint was when my iced coffee was more like coffee water. But no big deal. They remade it and apologized.  Whenever we're in the mood for a light hearted environment and a well cooked casual meal, we venture to this Dennys. And trust me, Ive had some really bad experiences at other locations.   If you do come here, Id say you need to ask for Crystola or Karin. Karin if youre looking for a chuckle or two, she'll tell you some stories that will make you laugh, and her old world accent just adds to the charm.   Crystola doesnt beat around the bush and will get you what you want and need when you ask for it. Shes not much of a talker but thats because shes working. :)  For as long as we will be in Arizona, this will always be our go to spot for coffee and a warm meal.   We have had their hot/cold coffee. Just about everything on the breakfast menu and lunch menu, but we havent really tried anything on the dinner side. Their burgers are always cooked perfectly, and their breakfast reminds me of my childhood on Saturday mornings."}
{"text":"Friday,  8:45 AM.  Having dropped off my car down the street I selected Denny's instead of the other fast food options available early in the morning.  I was seated immediately.  The waiter popped by thirty seconds later.  I ordered the Hash Skillet. When did Denny's go to skillets for breakfast.  I love skillets, and, yes, I haven't been in a Denny's in over five years. I took the up sell on the OJ and turned down the extra carbs ( e.g., toast, tortillas).  The food came about two minutes later.  It could be the fastest I've ever received an order from a sit down restaurant.  The bill came quickly after the last bite, and I paid at the cashier's station.  I had a good experience at Denny's and I'm willing to admit it."}
{"text":"I use to love to eat a Dennys, but my recent experience was not how I remembered it. The service is slow and the food is nothing special for its prices. The staff act like they are doing us a favor by bring us food we ordered. I will say stay away from here unless you like slow service and cheap food with good food prices."}
{"text":"Fast service and friendly staff. Not my number one place to go to for dinner but it was open and my kids are picky eaters."}
{"text":"Holy Cow.  I am impressed.  Yes, I know its \"just a Dennys.\"  Go ahead, make fun. But, I actually loved the staff here.  I went to this Dennys location for the first today, and had the warmest, friendliest experience.  I was greeted, seated, and ordered within minutes!  I sat at the bar, which I didnt mind doing at all.  My server was so attentive.  The staff here is good looking too.  the guys that work here make eating here half the fun.  Cute, cute cute!   For a good Dennys experience, this location is a must do.  Did I mention this place is open 24 hours??  BONUS!!!  Plus, its right near the expressway!  Its kind of hidden a little by some hotels, but you can still easily see it from the road!"}
{"text":"The food was cold but they discounted our check 25% and Kathy our waitress was so adorable and aa great server."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this was the worst service ive ever come across. The waitress was the nastiest most unprofessional lady ive ever seen. She stopped by our table twice the whole meal and that was only after i asked another a waiter for drink refills after 20 min of waiting, second was to give us the checks. My wife even saw her and another waitress talking bad about us and looking at us in the corner. We did nothing at all to this lady and she was a real b**ch. I work as a chef in a hotel and have worked jobs as line cooks and everything in between and never do i stiff a waiter but this was the first and hopefully only time i ever have to"}
{"text":"This place was clean and the utensils were clean and new Probably the best Denny's I been to so far"}
{"text":"I love this place! Idk why so many people choose to eat at these expensive restaurants and buffets in Vegas, when you can get waaaaaaaaay more bang for your buck at Denny's! IMO Denny's is the best place to eat in Vegas, it's cheap and the food is good!"}
{"text":"Jaun, the manger is the best. He is one of a kind. Walked in and was welcomed and was asked about my day. Showed us to our seats and was just the best. I could have been served burnt toast ( I wasn't food was out of sight ) and still give 5 stars because of the manger. Will be back"}
{"text":"Went back for a second (free) breakfast before checking out of the Day's Inn. It was a lot less crowded on a Monday morning than a Sunday afternoon. Nonetheless, it took a very long time for them to serve a bowl of oatmeal and some fruit. I also had to remind the waitress to bring the fruit.   My sister ordered juice, but it took an additional ten minutes to tell us that it wasn't available because they ran out. She ordered a different type of juice. Another ten minute delay ensued. Apparently they were out of two types of juices at 9am on a Monday? Try again. Seriously. At that point, we just wanted to get out of the smelly dinning room from the smoke-filled casino nearby.   When we went to settle our tab, but the girl still charged my sister for the drinks she never consumed. After speaking to the manager, they fixed the error. Meh, seriously, don't ever pay to eat here. Even for free, think twice and think hard. There are so many better choices in Vegas. If I wasn't such a thrifty person, I wouldn't have given this place a second thought."}
{"text":"Greasy cold food with far less exceptional service. Avoid if you can. The renovation looks great. So there was a positive."}
{"text":"I stopped into this Denny's and had breakfast for dinner yesterday. I also ordered food to go for my wife and she liked it as well.   The service and food was both very good. There was plenty of parking, the restaurant was clean and the prices were affordable.  I hadn't had breakfast at Denny's in about 10 years and the sausage links they are using now are much better than the ones they used to use."}
{"text":"Wife and I went here one night at midnight. Ordered the food to go very good customer service and friendly people. The inside is clean and very nice looking. Good spot for people traveling right off the interstate. Quick to get to and good food for not to much"}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast and experienced the best customer service! Trisha is an exceptional server! Had the chocolate peanut butter pancakes...like eating the nectar of awesomeness. Far superior to the Reeses pancakes I had tried at OverEasy"}
{"text":"The customer service here is absolutely TERRIBLE. We placed an order through GrubHub here and it was taking longer than normal for us to get an update. We called them and was passed around from person to person trying to find someone who would help us. Finally the last woman who spoke to us said she'd \"check on our order\" of which she proceeded to put me on hold and never came back after 10 MINUTES. We called back and they said it would be ready \"soon\" which finally gave us an update on grub hub saying it was finally on it's way after an HOUR after placing the order. When we got our food a piece of our order was missing and the hot chocolate we had ordered was completely watered down. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Okay, I gave this Denny's another shot since I've been living closer to this one as of the past year and the one I usually went to closed down. This Denny's has stellar food. However, the service can be alright at best at times and this Denny's has to easily be the dirtiest Denny's I've ever seen most days. One time a waitress spilt coffee all over the floor and walked away without noticing. I was worried someone was going to slip on it (that, and it's very gross to leave on the floor without mopping it up) so I alerted the very same waitress who spilled it on the floor. She said she'd handle it. We were there for another 30-45 minutes and by the time we left it still hadn't been cleaned up. Also, one time I got chocolate milk there that was most certainly off and possibly expired as it was very sour and gross. Food is good, service isn't great, and cleanliness is sorely lacking."}
{"text":"This is the nicest Denny's around.  Most are run down in my opinion, but this is newer and well maintained.  The staff are great and friendly and the breakfast food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Waiter was super friendly but we found 2 hairs in the cheese sticks, pretty nasty.  When the first hair was found they put it a new order which was nice but then we found another"}
{"text":"I went to Denny's, first time in years, on the 8th of January to use my free Grand Slam breakfast offer.  I really went in with low hopes as Denny's has disappointed before (Note: I was sober and this review does not reflect the importance of drunk Denny's).  Fortunately on this trip Denny's really pulled through.  The wife and I both enjoyed our meal.    I had the slam with eggs, ham steak, hash, and sour dough toast.  Ham steak is a great addition / substitute for the super thin bacon.  Alison went with the yogurt, fresh fruit, gingerbread french toast, and bacon.  We were both surprised to see fresh fruit and not something frozen and thawed....wow.  She loved the french toast and of course bacon is bacon, thin but good.  So you ask why the 3 stars??  First off my idea of a 5 star breakfast joint is a greasy spoon place where they don't skimp on quantity or quality, not to mention somewhere that puts their own spin on certain staples.  Other qualities are cleanliness, appearance, and something I call the 'post-breakfast hit or run'.  You either have food that stays with you which is the 'hit' and you have the other.  Denny's gets dinged for not being unique in any way, by not EVER wiping down the table side menu and rarely cleaning the condiment tray.  The floors were a disaster and just did not have a healthy look to the place.  The food however was a hit and met my standards which was all I was expecting for a free birthday Grand Slam."}
{"text":"Food was good, the waitress Janelle was one of the best. She was always smiling, did not come over to much or not enough.  The place was clean aswell. What I did not like was howbI could he some employee yelling at another in the background. All and all. I would return."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I placed an online order and when I got there they couldn't find my order and then they had me wait in line to pay just to add an additional 30 minutes to get my drinks because they couldn't finds cups."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed my turkey breakfast sandwich. Service was really good & friendly. Ready for the pecan pie I purchased!!!"}
{"text":"The food is alright. It's not particularly good, but not horrible either. The staff is what you expect of a typical chain restaurant, so no complaints there.  The 24 hour option is good so if there's no better option, you can't go wrong here.   The food here is generally on the saltier side."}
{"text":"Severely understaffed. One employee for the entire restaurant and the chef in the kitchen. Went here at 3 AM, there was garbage all over the floor and all the tables. Never saw anything like it. Was told \"sit anywhere, over there maybe\". After waiting 45 minutes and not even being asked if we wanted drinks, we left."}
{"text":"The food here is always good, service is always friendly. This is my favorite diner on the strip. Definitely reccomended if you're looking for a 24/7 diner.  Food - 3/5 Value - 3.5/5 Service - 5/5 Atmpshere - 3.5/5"}
{"text":"thugs was my first time here. Prices are higher than a hometown dennys but kinda expected it because it's on the strip in Las Vegas. All in all fur 3am out was good."}
{"text":"This Denny's Dinner has always been awesome!  The food is good,  the service is excellent, & location, just off Loop 202, very convenient.  =)"}
{"text":"Went online and was pleasantly surprised that Denny's delivers. So, I placed my order, and it stated it would take 55 minutes. I only ordered chicken nuggets and a salad, but I figured the wait time was because they were busy. Over and hour went by and my food still wasn't delivered. I called and the girl that answered the phone told me that their Denny's didn't deliver. Okay, we'll, I had already paid and was charged a delivery fee, and gave a tip. The girl sounded disinterested, and had no customer service skills whatsoever, not to mention had somewhat of an attitude. I asked if they received delivery notifications, even though they don't personally deliver, and she said yes. So instead of calling me once my order came in to notify me, I guess I was suppose to eventually wonder where my food was and why I was being charged for a service they don't have. She put me on hold, so she could get the manager, and I waited close to 10 minutes before handing up. I tried to call Denny's back over 10 times in a 20 minute period, and it kept ringing and ringing with no answer. I got so frustrated that I had my husband call on his phone, and the same girl picked up on the second ring! My call was being screened, because she didn't know how to resolve my problem. I was livid. My husband talked to the manager who finally after hours  since my order was put in, refunded me my money. I will never give this location any business. That girl needs to really be re-evaluated for her position there, and/or trained in customer service."}
{"text":"Denny's is a great place to get something to eat. When I stayed in Toronto I went there almost everyday for breakfast. The milkshakes are really good and so are the breakfasts. I got French toast and eggs Benedict and they were both good. The food is good but you can probably get similar food at other places like smittys etc. If you want a good place to get breakfast (or lunch, diner) try this place!"}
{"text":"This Denny's cant go any higher than two I am sorry it just can't. All the poor experiences keep adding up and yet I keep going back and back again. Why you might wonder? Because its open 24 hours that's the only reason  Now let's talk about the positive angles of Denny's. It's cheap, it's open all the time, the service is surprisingly quick, some of their breakfast platters are decent enough and satisfy the hungry heart. That's about all the good I can muster up.  The bad? Oh golly miss Molly! Well let's start with the atmosphere at about 2 30 am on a Friday night. Basically a drunk tank with all the rowdy and tasteless characters one could ask for! Doing what they do best! Being loud, obnoxious and rude, just not knowing when to stop! Now don't get me wrong I actually enjoy the circus but when the clowns only know a few tricks I get bored fast. I have seen some fights break out! the staff is well.... they do their best I can't blame them because they seem to deal with a lot of crap. I am sure they have developed a thick callous and are better at patience than most   The food, well with some exceptions it's not very good. I mean definitely the burgers and fries will hit the spot when needed. The sandwhiches do the trick when your hungry. But watch out for the chicken burger! My good pal Angelo got one once and the he took a bite and it was raw in the middle! bad bad bad! I think they gave him a milkshake to compensate. Thank goodness he didn't get sick! So if your desperate for food at 2:30 am then by all means come on down! But I have learned my lesson to many times ! I hope I never come back! Seriously go to McDonald's instead!  8/30"}

{"text":"After dropping off a truck at the Uhaul next door, this is the closest place to hang until my ride could get me. Ugh. Should have called a cab.  They changed the menu - drastically - and it sucks. No French dip, no salmon salad, no chicken Caesar. Had to settle.  I used to love their chicken noodle soup. Figured I'd drown my sorrows in a nice big bowl. I got a big bowl, alright. A big empty bowl - barely 1/4 full. I paid for the bowl, but I bet the cup actually had more soup in it.  Got the steak cobb. Lots off lettuce. Lots and lots and lots of lettuce. If you look at the picture, do you see the steak? Me either. After digging through the first layer, I found another layer of lettuce. The piece of steak I did mine in all that lettuce was so salty it was nearly inedible.  It's sad that Dennys has actually managed to go downhill - I guess the hill was bigger than I thought.  Oh, yeah, the service. Pretty typical Dennys. If the server asks if you need a moment SAY NO! Even if you have no idea what you want, don't let him leave or you will never see him again. Refills? Forget it. Extra dressing? You'll have to jump in front of him because there will be no eye contact as he runs by.   Made the mistake of using the bathroom on the way out. Ewwwwww!  One more rant to add: the WiFi does not work."}
{"text":"Typical Denny's, decent food, slow service. This one has a really nice meeting room. I came as a guest of one of the Toastmasters clubs that meets here.   Linda, our waitress, would do much better in tips if she wasn't so surly and maybe tried to smile. We were the only patrons at that time, yet it was like pulling crocodile teeth to get coffee in the first place and refills thereafter. When I asked for a menu, she shouted from across the room, \"There's a whole bunch of them right here,\" then gave me a look like I was an imbecile for not knowing that the waitress couldn't lower herself to bring menus to the customers' tables. Silly me, I just assumed, given that's how it's been done at every Denny's I've been to since...well...ever. She made me feel like an unwelcome burden.   Here's a tip, lady: Ya got one job. As a customer, I'm it. If you can't bother to take care of me and even pretend to be friendly, find another line of work. Maybe something that requires deep sea diving or solitary confinement.  PS, the bathroom was an unmitigated pig sty. Neither the paper towel nor soap dispenser worked. It smelled like dirty diapers."}
{"text":"Came here at 1am with my friends, and the food was good, the service was friendly, and my hunger problem was fixed fast because the food came out quick.  I was surprised that my three dip chips were so great at 1am and my custom pancakes were cooked just to my liking.  Finishing off with a delicious PB shake and a banana split made the meal even better."}
{"text":"Came here at 2am cause I was craving some stomach satisfaction.  I have been wanting to try the new build a burger, and it was way beyond my expectations.  For a chain diner that specualizes in breakfast, I did not expect big things; I was wrong.  I got a gigantic burger piled high with onions, green peppers, onion tanglers, spinach, chipotle sauce, and chile.  They were all out of mushrooms, so that was a heart breaker, but the deliciousness of my big messy burger made up for it.  Like I said, solid burger, especailly for like $8.  Can't get a better burger at 2am in Irwin."}
{"text":"Big breakfast! Price is OK since I took a doggy bag and had enough for 2 days! Pancakes with banana caramel is great. Eggs real nice. Nothing bad to say about this place. Not real fancy though.."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast ! Thanks Tyler.  Very attentive service. Delicious food.   Clean, friendly, helpful staff.  We were lucky. No wait on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"70+ year old hostess Shelby: \"Where does a one-legged waitress work\"   Us: *Blank stares*   Shelby: \"IHOP\"   Yeah... it was one of those nights.   I was actually really impressed with this particular Denny's. Both the hostess and our waitress were EXTREMELY nice and accommodating, especially since we were a large, obnoxiously drunken group of people stumbling in after midnight.   The food came out quick and correct, my cup was never empty and the booth made for a nice resting place for my head.   Thanks Denny's. Without my delicious chocolate milkshake and 2 egg breakfast I would have puked and passed out in the parking lot."}
{"text":"You need a host or hostess at the cash register. We came in and it took 8\" to get seated. After 4\" I walked around to find someone. She said, \"someone will be right with you.\" Then it was another 4\" before someone seated us. This happened over and over as I watched people enter. Your workers either can't see the door because of the wall behind the register or they don't care. I haven't been to Denny's in 5 years and this makes me not want to come back. I will try once more to make sure this wasn't a fluke.  Also, they were out of coffee. We had to wait five more minutes while they made a fresh pot. How does this happen at 8:00 am? On a good note, our server was great. The food was good. The newer decor is really nice. Would love this place if they had coffee made and someone to seat you."}
{"text":"Thanks to the honest staff at Denny's I was able to recover my glasses! Great food and service."}
{"text":"The place was empty pretty much. We waited to be seated. Manager looked at us and continued talking to someone else. Then we waited to order. Then not all food came. Pancakes where not cooked all the way they where doughy."}
{"text":"ok I know not everyone in this world is a genius, but what does it take to get an order right?        My Wife, son and Myself wanted a late night snack and ice cream after a ball game. So we decided to go to Denny's. The one we normally go to was packed so we opted to visit this one.. My Wife and son decided to also eat something. My wife ordered her food and said to the waitress I will also be wanting to get this item after I eat ( the 4 dollar brownie sundae ) and said i'm just letting you know cause I know it takes a bit to put together. My son ordered a chocolate shake and his sandwich. I ordered the strawberry sundae. I said I want 2 scoops vanilla ice cream strawberry topping and whip cream no nuts.. Repeated it to her 2 more times as she had a puzzled look on her face.         In about 4 min or so, she shows up at the table with my wife's desert ( she hasn't even gotten her food yet )  my sons chocolate shake and a bowl containing 2 scoops of strawberry ice cream with whip cream on top..  I said umm this isn't what i ordered. she looked at me like dear in the head lights.. and i said its suppose to be 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream strawberry topping and whip cream.. she nods and say or I'm sorry.. goes back to the kitchen and bring me out the very same bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream added and a very small amount of strawberry topping only on the vanilla ice cream. and here sat the other two scoops of strawberry ice cream and the whip cream.. The new scoop had no whip cream.. i gave up.. I ate it anyway.. then as all this is going on my families food came out.. it was really good.. But my wife would have preferred to enjoyed her desert after her food I'm sure, rather then before..     Now its time to pay..  I go to the front and the counter is partially blocked by game machines..  So I kinda say to the girl at the register, this counter is kinda back wards it should be reversed so that are there is where we pay. she looks at me and goes HUH? so I try to explain just to send this girl into never land..  And she never came out of it.. I signed my check and we left.. Saying we will never go back again to this location..      Then today I check my bank account and they charged me for my check and there is a second charge for another amount also.. and not what the tip should have been like another full check but not the same price..  So now i have to go fight that also..       Stay clear of this Denny's its so not worth it.."}
{"text":"Had a yummy grandslam breakfast on my birthday.  Updates look beautiful as does the new menu options.  I miss my crispy Buffalo chicken salad but the chicken avocado salad was yummy.  Wait staff was very pleasant  and we had really great experience once again."}
{"text":"very satisfied with the service, our server was Jon. very friendly, funny and attentive. we got buorbon chicken and sirlion steak, our food came out fast. just one thing, if u dont like sweet food ask for bourbon sauce on the side because it was little too sweet. oh also their mimosas are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Man I love this location. We're here for the Expo so our motel is just a couple hundred yards away from delicious food. I can't get enough of their chicken strips. They look over breaded like KFC's but they actually aren't.  The gravy is spicy and combines heavenly with the strips. The steak fries are the perfection of crispness. And the waiting staff! So friendly and really on board with making sure our random drinks are always full. I didn't even ask for a refill and she just came over with a new one. I am very happy to have this place so close."}
{"text":"2nd timer. This time worthy of a review. Saturday morning about 9:30. This location was buzzing, but not completely full. As with all Dennys that I know of,  they appeared short staffed. The manager was visible and actively engaged.  The host was friendly and greeted us quickly. We were party of 6. Several tables open, but not yet cleaned off. Server  was friendly and attentive. Food was ok. I had an omellete which was good, but the veggies on the omellete,  specifically the green peppers,  were over cooked. That's a big pet peeve of mine. Otherwise, I left satisfied. The kids left satisfied. Overall, all signs point to us definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I ate at a Denny's.  When I think of going out to breakfast, I want to go to these popular little spots like the Cracked Egg, The Egg and I, or Hash House a gogo.  This particular Sunday I had a lot of running around to do and missed breakfast. I was STARVED.  One of my friends who is a super healthy eater had just texted that he was on a road trip and found a Denny's to aid in his healthy eating. I couldn't imagine what he could get at a Denny's that would be healthy OR delicious.  Boy was I wrong!  In between errands, I spotted the Denny's on Tropicana and decided to give it a try. It was fairly empty so I got seated right away and service was great.  I ordered the Fit Fare omelet with a side of fruit and it was amazing. Everything was cooked perfectly and the fruit was super fresh.  I've had healthy omelets at other breakfast places before and none tasted this good. My tummy was very happy.  In addition to the awesome food, the place is very clean and service was very quick. Perfect spot for a quick and cheap, but awesomely delicious and healthy breakfast at any of the day."}
{"text":"This location tends to be busy almost all of the time, but despite that, most of the time the service is good, but not ALL the time.. food is always great and the place is always well taken care of. Recommended."}
{"text":"Very friendly and efficient staff, spotlessly clean, great 'diner' food - recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm only just giving this Denny's a 'sort of ok', and that's for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the seats have holes in them and at times the place is shoddy / not overly clean. Also, the service is VERY variable and can take an age / lack of attention for top ups at times. Also the food quality is all over the map too... One time you go in and the food is great.. next time you wonder why you went in there... So... Overall it's never good and sometimes bad.. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"So, I stopped going to Denny's for MANY years.. but a club I belong to has a meet there, so I decided to give it a go... VERY pleasantly surprised, they appear to have revamped the menu (in a good way) and the levels of service, cleanliness and food quality are certainly improved. I've tried a few different menu items now and have enjoyed them all - at a very reasonable price (and that is key here, we are talking value for money type deal, NOT high end), thoroughly recommend."}
{"text":"Okay it's a classic american dinner. It's okay that it looks like a dinner.  Food is always good. Service here was outstanding."}
{"text":"Was actually surprised. Was upgraded a bit from the last time I was there. Food was ok, not great but not bad. Service was nice and food came out very fast. Our meal was actually free because the Pirates hit a home run the night before. Need to have the coupon though for it."}
{"text":"Yesterday we went for breakfast. I had to wait 10 minutes for my pancakes while my husband had his. When mine finally came they were BURNT on the bottom. Never going here again"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in to eat one morning and sat there for 10 minutes being completely ignored. As we got up to leave one of the hostesses said \"sorry\" to us which told me that they sat there watching us be ignored and decided to do nothing about it. I've spent many years in restaurants and that's just unacceptable. Had someone simply came up to us and at least acknowledged us, that would be different. Worst customer service. Never going back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Food is pretty standard for Denny's however usually we go to Denny's for fast service and in this case it took 1 hour to get our food. Nothing was a special order. I do not recommend this place if you are looking for fast."}
{"text":"The worst!!!! I called ahead and was told that there was no wait! I get here and the lobby is packed FULL of people waiting to be seated.   I have now been here for 20 minutes (7 people in my party) and still have not been seated!!! Unbelievable that the offered us two different table across the room from each other! If I wanted to sit separate from those that I came with, I would have never told you we had 7 people!!!!   NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service. My boyfriend and I went to this location Friday around midnight. There were about three other customers and only one server. Zane ( our server) had a great sense of humor and was quick to get our drinks , appetizer and main courses. I love Denny's , where else can you eat pancakes, onion rings, a cheeseburger and ice cream at 12 am! Get some!"}
{"text":"Good service, smiling faces, and the best food Denny's has to offer. Unlike most Denny's I have been to, I don't think anyone is on parole here."}
{"text":"This place sucks.. Food was late and served cold. The cooks sucked. The soups were horrible and smelled bad. Valarie (manager) was not a problem solver, she got trust issues. The tables are always dirty. No no no.  Don't go to Denny's, and if you do.. Don't go to this one.."}
{"text":"This was definitely the Denny's in town to go to, but I think the word got out and now the friendly place with laid back hard working staff, great atmosphere, and service is  still there but now too many younger people with unbehaved children are invading the place.   The once casual environment has been replaced with gentle chaos.  The is the one reason I would drive this far to go here.  Now I have to consider whether it's worth it anymore.  Turning into look like all the other Denny's in town.  Still need older community area where we can relax and enjoy our meals without little kids screaming and running around.  We've earned that right."}
{"text":"Store manager was: Billy (no one knew his last name).  This was the worst experience I've ever had at a Denny's. When I had to complain about the food, they did a re-fire and made it even worse. Over cooked eggs and overcooked and cold hashbrowns the first time, followed by under cooked eggs and lethargic hashbrowns the second time. Tried to speak to store manager, but he wouldn't come out of the kitchen. Simply a coward. Don't eat here, food may be bad for your health.  Corporate will be getting a call."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of organized chaos. The kitchen was running very poorly, staff are running around trying to keep up with orders and the kitchen delivering or not delivering them, and the manager had to jump in the kitchen to get things done. This might be a place during off hours, but try to stay away during the peak hours  because they can't keep up.  The staff was friendly, and attentive. The quality of food wasn't that great, Case in point: ordered eggs over medium, and it took four times for them to come out cooked correctly. Overall, rating of three. Food not great staff made up for it slightly.  Also no measure of a discount for having to wait for the eggs to be cooked four different times and the rest of the food got cold."}
{"text":"We got our food after over an hour of waiting, with people coming in after us, getting their food first. They then served everyone but my 5 year old daughter. A couple of minutes later comes her chicken on a stick. As she took her 2nd bite, I noticed something was off. Upon closer inspection, we noticed the chicken was raw. I'm sick to my stomach. The waitress apologized and took 30% off the ticket, but the manager avoided us, and didn't come over. My sister went up and spoke to the manager after, and he took off my daughter's order, since she ate nothing from it. This is the last time."}
{"text":"We waited awhile to be served due to the volume in the restaurant at night which is completely understandable. The server Kelly came from her section to help serve us after noticing the length we waited. She had our order in asap and our food came out fast! Thanks to her we didn't go else where. Great customer service, pays attention to details and you can tell she's familiar to mulitasking. 5 stars Dennys."}
{"text":"What people need to remember about Denny's or Jenny's is that even though the social atmosphere is outrageous and you WILL meet awesome people, it is still DENNY's. Therefore expecting it to be an outrageous food experience is a nice wish but ultimately they have he same ingredients, same crappy thin bacon, same decent fries etc etc as every other Denny's. If you want a late night hangout this is awesome. If you want culinary uniqueness it's not happening."}
{"text":"The food was so nasty it made us sick  Eggs were watery with cheese burnt on top  Hash browns were rock hard   Everything was just horrible  Service was so good the staff was super good staff was super nice wish I could say the same about the food"}
{"text":"Worst service I ever had at a Denny's.  This location lacks everything.  From the simplest things like motivation and common sence.  Had a worker drop all our drinks on us and all she could ask was if we wanted to move tables. . Just rude all together"}
{"text":"So I'm on this new (awful lol) diet and this was my first time trying to eat out. Jennifer P. was our server and she was awesome. She was attentive, prompt and friendly.  She went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of and I really appreciate it!  As a server myself, I know how time consuming these special requests can be :)"}
{"text":"Clean, about what you'd expect from Denny's. My two year old got a kick out of the kids picture menu. That made him happy and my life easier, thanks Denny's."}
{"text":"Place is nearly empty. Service is far too slow. Making an omelette should not take forever. Had to have the waitress fill my tea cup to the top. It was only 2/3rd full. Omelette was excellent"}
{"text":"Denny's is, well, Dennys.  Standard just-this-side-of-fast-food chain place.  But who can fuck up Bacon and Eggs?  Well, honestly, pretty much anybody can, but I've never had a problem with this Dennys.  They also do a decent lunch menu.  I've been there for dinner, but at places like this, I pretty much stick to the breakfasts and burgers .  It's hard to fuck them up too.  Denny's is the kind of place you go to when a. nobody else is open, b. you don't know any other place, c. you know what to expect.  Kinda like comfort food, but commercialized."}
{"text":"One of the best Denny's I've been to. Atmosphere is warm and bright with the natural sunlight. Decent spacing in the small restaurant. Although the line was long, (be sure to get there early!) I got a seat within 10 mins for a party of 2. Waiter and waitress were very response. Never pressured or pushed us for an order. Had the Grand Slam and Cowboy meat plates. Pretty good. A bit salty for certain foods, but as expected. For the Cowboy  plate, save your money and get a hamburger. That's exactly what the meat tastes like. Drinks were quickly refilled when requested. There was an error in my bill and it was quickly fixed without any grumbling or glares. Definitely recommend this place for a quick bite, but be wary of the line during breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"What can I say- its Denny's. Who doesn't love Denny's breakfast foods?! I can't get enough of their pancakes. I like the fact that there is a Denny's in the Fremont district. Im not sure how long this Denny's has been here, but its super clean and very modernized (not your typical looking Denny's)...I had no problem with service. Food came out at a reasonable time and my pancakes were yummy as always. Oh can't forget, it has a full bar."}
{"text":"Last night a group of friends and I decided to go to Denny's and ended up at this location. I have to say the experience was horrible!!! There was only one server, the manager and two guys in the kitchen. We got out order all messed up, the waitress said the grill person was new and we didn't mind at all, we understood and said it was fine. Food was neither good or bad, very average. The problem was the waitress' attitude towards her coworkers, she started yelling at them saying that the order was all messed up and blah blah blah, then she started yelling to the manager that she needed help and that she was about to leave; it was so uncomfortable to be there, the manager went to our table to ask what else we were missing and I could see that she was about to cry. The waitress wasn't rude at us but it was really awful to see the way she acted in front of the customers. Two or more people actually left the place before even ordering. I'm not trying to be mean, but this place really needs to improve in too many ways."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having breakfast here while in Vegas. Had John as a waiter and he was excellent,in a great mood and made our table laugh any chance he got . I ate the peanut butter cup pancakes and sweet Jesus the were heavenly :) very sweet but hit the spot. This place is great,cheap and service is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Dennys has got to be my breakfast go to place when ever I'm in the mood for breakfast at anytime of the day.  Living in Las Vegas you obviously have a wide variety of places you can go to for breakfast or  any kind of meal for that matter but for whatever reason there is nothing like going back to the original old school places like Dennys.  This location on Cheyenne and Craig is one the the busiest, and most popular by far as there is access to the freeway and makes it an accessible location for any one traveling on the 15 freeway.   I came with the family, we were seated right away. Our server approached us as soon ad we were seated, and took our drink order with a very friendly approach.  Our order was taken and even though there were a lot of people in there, we got our food within a 15 minute time frame. The food was really good, I mean it is Dennys and not a 5 star restaurant but for what it's worth it was filling and the breakfast was a good.  Our server was very attentive to our needs and was very friendly. Our experience was really good overall, and I would give this Danny's a 3.5 rating."}
{"text":"Overall the food is good. Just dont go between 1 and 4 am because the food is kind of gross. The environment is pretty cool since it looks like a 50s diner."}
{"text":"I love the way the remodel looks.  Food was great and desert was great.  Always fast and efficient service thanks Hollee and Frankie."}
{"text":"First took a while for them to just sit people down and it wasn't even busy, coke tasted flat, didn't get my order right and while taking my wife's order she didn't let her speak till the end of questions, was rude and took away the syrup while we were eating to give to another table and didn't even ask us if we were finished with it. And this wasn't the first time I have had issues here just thought I might give them a second chance but nope still the same service."}
{"text":"My familiy and I love dennys we came here for the first time since we come from California.. We got greeted nicely and we felt welcome...  We did have to wait for a lil bit for our food but we do understand that it super busy.. our waitress ALEXIS was a really awesome person she greeted us super friendly.. she had a smile on her face while she was waiting to serve our food. We also had a lil talk with the manager Peggy  and let her know our concerns she was a really nice person aswell.. Our pleasure was to be able to dine in. Thank you ALEXIS AND PEGGY"}
{"text":"Food was okay. They don't have a cheap $2/$4/$6/$8 menu and there's no were to find that out until you sit down and they don't give you one. My server was nice but clearly over busy. It took him 8 min to come back with a fork and napkin but all was forgiven when he brought me a fresh to go cup of coffee with extra creamer with my check.    Kind of a ghetto Denny's but I could be seduced back my their FULL BAR."}
{"text":"Love this Denny's Location. The wait staff is excellent-ask for Angie or Karen if you go for breakfast or lunch.  Best Pancakes.  Best Eggs and bacon.  The dinner menu is especially good! Pot Roast anyone?"}
{"text":"Love this Denny's.  Has a great neighborhood feel to it. The have fundraisers for the Actor's Youth Theater Group and some churches nearby.  Every little bit helps our Gilbert community. They also have an outdoor covered patio that I have used for a presentation to a small group of my clients-FREE of charge. Great coffee, GREAT Pancake Puppies. BTW, their dinner menu is awesome!"}
{"text":"Have you seen the New Denny's look?  They did a remodel a year or so ago and this place looks new and fresh and the kind of place you could even have a business meeting in the back section, if you wanted a little privacy.  The service is excellent and the Manager is on top of pretty much everything. Have you tried the dinner menu items?  Wow-the pot roast is great!"}
{"text":"Horrible!! I wish I was able to give 0 stars. We ate here last summer during our stay at Tahiti Village and we were all very disappointed but we decided to give them another try during this stay because it was convenient.   The service is extremely slow. We waited 35 mins for them to bring our food out. With 6 hungry kids under the age of 10 that is a very long time. By the time they brought it out the food was cold. And to top it off my son forgot his Nintendo DS on the table and when we went back they said no one had found it. Theives!"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place, seems somewhat chaotic at times, but they still serve great food.  My favorite is the Super Bird!    They also have kids eat free nights."}
{"text":"Came here 1/30/16 for some breakfast after my flight. What do you expect from a Denny's in Vegas. Cheap breakfast for a good price. 15 minute wait when it was a packed house. They attend to you quickly. They didn't clean the table. Food take about 25 minutes to arrive. Waitress was nice but could tell she couldn't manage all her tables timely.   The people next to us we're pissed with only coffee and had not ordered for about 45 minutes. Hahaha.... Denny's still love you. P.S. My pancakes we're dry and not fluffy. :( The little Filipino greeter is funny."}
{"text":"As can be expected with this chain, the portions are out of control, just plate fully of food. I tried the new salted caramel and banana cream pancakes. Fluffy and huge, also comes with bacon or sausage, eggs, and hash potatoes. I shared the eggs with my wife and could not even come close to finishing the potatoes.   The service was pretty quick, coffee cups were constantly being refilled, very friendly wait staff. Plus we had the added bonus of waking up early enough to beat the Saturday morning crowd. As we were leaving the place was packed.   I can't believe I'm saying this, but I wish they would make the portions a little smaller, with a price to reflect that of course. If I can't empty this plate, I can't imagine too many people could either.   We were pleased, and will be back again, should we be up early to beat the crowds again. I wouldn't want to wait in a line up here as it's not one of their bigger locations, and can fill up pretty quick."}
{"text":"Denny's has been around for a long time, and not surprisingly, they have a lot of locations in the Vegas Valley. This is the closest stand-alone location to my house (as in not being in a casino), so it is no surprise that I find myself in here than most of their other restaurants.  Denny's is a good restaurant due to the sheer variety of food items they have. They serve breakfast all day and are proud of it, but also have plenty of lunch/dinner items to eradicate your hunger as well. It's a huge menu, and you'll be hard-pressed not to find something you want on here.  The service tends to be a bit inconsistent here. There have been times where I have found myself waiting annoyingly long periods of time for items that come much quicker at other similar restaurants. Yet other times, the staff are attentive and get me my food quickly and promptly. Nearly all of the staff I have encountered are friendly, though.  As far as atmosphere goes, it's about what you'd expect from this type of restaurant - and it DOES get pretty noisy and hectic during peak hours. The waiting area up front gets VERY crowded during this time, and there have been many times I have found myself standing there, waiting for a seat for considerably longer than I should be.  But all things considered, Denny's is a fantastic restaurant and usually doesn't fail to please. This location is in a convenient location on Warm Springs, between Stephanie and Marks. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This Denny's restaurant is in the Fiesta Henderson. The food and such are what you'd expect from Denny's, and I do mean that in a good way - for the most part.  When I first entered this restaurant (for the first time), the hostess asked me if a table was all right. I prefer to sit in booths, so I actually took offense to this - the proper thing to say would have been \"would you prefer a table or a booth?\" Asking me if a table is all right implies no booths are available or something is wrong with them.   For my meal I ordered chicken soup and french toast - but they just plain forgot about the soup. I had to remind them AFTER I got my french toast. They were nice enough to give me the soup for free, but the whole reason I get the soup is to hold me over until I get my entree.   Being in a casino, this restaurant has no divider wall between the gaming area and the restaurant, which is annoying (though fortunately it is higher up than the gambling, so the noise and odor of smoke aren't too bad.) This also means there are no bathrooms in the restaurant.  This isn't the best Denny's I have ever eaten in, though certainly not the worst. Still, I'll drive the few extra miles to the stand-alone Warm Springs location to avoid all the casino noise and hit-and-miss service."}
{"text":"Okay, let's get it straight here:  This is:                       Denny's They serve:                Denny's food They're open:            24 hours Your expectations:   moderately low, but you still expect some quality                                      to the food and service  . . .and you'll get it here.  Yes, it's Denny's, but $6 plus drink, tax, and tip will get you a decent and filling breakfast plate at 9 in the morning, 3 in the afternoon, or 12 midnight., and that ain't bad.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  If all you're looking for is Denny's, this Denny's will do just fine, especially if you're on the road in town at 10:00 at night and all the other restaurants around have already closed."}
{"text":"My wife (who is from Phoenix and spent countless meals at this restaurant) characterized this place to me as the \"Gay Denny's\"--a label I was apprehensive about mentioning in my review until I read the the reviews of other Yelpers.  After seeing about a dozen or more references to \"Jenny's\", I realized that my wife's characterization is not only accurate, but quite routine and popular.  Please note that even Yelp categorizes this place under \"Diners, Gay Bars\".  That speaks volumes of coolness.  There is little to distinguish this from any other Denny's, and during the day it is the mild-mannered place we are all familiar with.  But at night, and particularly in the wee hours of the morning, the alt crowd arrives.  Many people from Goth and LGBTQ clubs pile in here for food at that time after dancing and socializing.  My wife and I went here after our visit to Sanctum--she walked in with her Gothy attire and no-one batted an eye.  The place had quite a crowd at 2am and they were mostly a fairly young, hip group.  Food was. . .Denny's.  Service was fine.  If you go here at 2am, you know you're not going for the food in particular but for the crowd and maybe some people watching if you're into that sort of thing.  If you're looking for a great place to get some post clubbing eats, Jenny's definitely hits a Grand Slam.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Always excellent service and great food! This is our go to place for a quick and satisfying meal.  Consistent quality day or night.  Perfect for late night pancake or ice cream sundae cravings.  A+"}
{"text":"I was craving for a nice omelette, Dennys came to mind.   We walked into Dennys thinking we'd order, eat, pay and be out within 45mins-1 hour. Mind you, at the time, there were less than 5 tables seated in the restaurant.  It took 5 mins before someone dropped off the menus. And 10 for the water to come. While ordering, the waiter asked us to repeat the order 3 times. Another 20 mins for the food to be brought to the table.   This place took foooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorever. One of the waitresses kept on apologizing as we were waiting, she couldn't take our orders or help us because she was getting off soon. She was still there when we left, so mmmh??    Anyway, we ended up taking the food to go when it finally came, it was way too hangry. And by the time I got to eat, i didn't enjoy my omelette because it was cold and gross."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place would not serve us breakfast at 3am. They told us that the kitchen would not be open till 430am. The gentleman at the front was very rude. We decided to go next door to the ihop. Which offered amazing customer service."}
{"text":"we arrived around 9:30 pm on a friday. it started out good but things went downhill from there.  there wasnt that much people that day yet our food was serve incomplete. i never got my drink and everytime i would remind them the lady kept saying\" yeah im getting to it\". there were 6 servers including the manager which none of them had name tags by way. i dont understand how they couldnt handle 5 tables?  what i found very unprofessional was that they all kept arguing against each other. very unprofessional when your guest can hear\"why you dont want to take the next guest\"."}
{"text":"crappy service, unclean store and why is there ice cream machine ALWAYS down?! And they never seem to have enough people working or a bunch of call offs. I can never just come here, order and have a great time."}
{"text":"Probably the busiest Denny's I've ever been to. Came here for lunch and to kill time while waiting for my car to get serviced. I walked in and the guy at the stand was closing the register and didn't even acknowledge me. Some other girl came to the front and thought I was cashing out, so she told the guy that ignored me and he sat me down. No interest in me, I know you're busy but a simple \"hi, give me a moment to wrap this up, and I'll be right with you.\" Would have been enough. After being seated I was greeted by Jill. Jill is amazing. She's super sweet, friendly, and to top it off; patient. I'm recently gluten free so it takes me a while to order. She didn't hover and gave me space. She genuinely cares about her tables. She would check on me at the right time. I loved her ! The Gm came by and asked how my food was. She was also hands on making her rounds! I loved this ! Keep up the great work and service !"}
{"text":"The service was great on every visit bar one when the server got our order wrong and refused to change it. But i wont let one visit  tarnish the place. Its a nice friendly environment and the staff have always been helpful and courteous. Food orders typically took around 20 minutes which for a steak i did not consider to bad considering the place is normally really busy."}
{"text":"I had to catch an early morning flight from Madison, Wisconsin this morning and was looking for a place to catch some breakfast at 4 am. Not much is open at 4 am in Madison, but Denny's was open. So I made a u-turn and pulled in the parking lot. I was quickly seated and the waitress, who was friendly, quickly took my drink and food order. The food was quickly served and tasted better than usual for Denny's. I paid and was in and out in 20 minutes. I will keep this Denny's in mind for my next trip to Madison.  My ticket before tip was $15.42."}
{"text":"The wait to get seated wasn't bad as it was busy, 10 minutes. Once sat down that's a whole different story. Got our drink order right away but we didn't receive our drinks for another 10 minutes. Took our order and we had an appetizer and it ended up coming with our meal. Frustrating. Then I was supposed to have seasoned fries. I never got them the whole time we sat and ate. Good didn't taste that great. Our water cut had leftover cheese goo on the bottom of it, had to ask for another cup. Never got drink refills the whole time sitting. We were thirsty but just wanted to get outta there at this point. So overall don't go when busy!! Oh and the super bird is supposed to be on sourdough and my sandwich did not look like it was sourdough at all but again didn't wanna wait."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here around 9am on Saturday after seeing our hotel's disappointing breakfast bar.   There is almost nowhere in Elyria to get breakfast except for this place. Normally I don't go to Denny's, but I made an exception this time around because I was starving.  The menu was surprisingly big. And you can customize any dish to a certain extent without getting additional charges.  Our waitress was very friendly and inviting...which was nice a on rainy morning that canceled our plans to visit CP that day.  I ordered the Philly cheesesteak omelet which was a little greasy, but not too bad. My friend ordered some pancakes and eggs combo. The server brought her the wrong style of eggs and took a minute to get her scrambled ones.  This isn't the greatest breakfast place in the world, but it was acceptable at the moment."}
{"text":"Literally wtf is this place?? We had a group of 7 when we first walked in it looked like someone built a Denny's in a basement or something. It looks extremely dated, the backs of the chairs which are supposed to be red are basically black from dirt. When we were trying to be seated the guy looks at me and says \"can you not stand here\" ... like uhm what?? Someone finally got around to finding us a table. Waitress was nice.. seemed kinda annoyed. I would be too if I worked there. We all ordered and only 6 plates came out. The 7th plate never came. The place is so bad that my friend literally never got their food & they tried to bring his meal out with the check as if it was no big deal?? Corporate needs to send someone out here. So gross."}
{"text":"We came here when it was slow so we didn't have a wait and the waitress was attentive. The booths do need som repair they have tape on them and are peeling up a little."}
{"text":"Went in at breakfast time it was semi busy. ..but not packed. Walked out after 45 mins of waiting for a sandwich. I went to the waffle house instead."}
{"text":"Zero stars for this place cold fires an cold buns soda taste like soap Cynthia the server was as bad as they come never will i ever eat here even if it is the last place on the planet it is that bad don't waste your time of money at this Denny's never have I ever had such terrible service at a Denny's."}
{"text":"this location is perfect  came here after grabbing some bbt   my server is pretty and nice  but my food isn't the toast was soggy and the portion was small i'd expect a bigger portion because arent people the hungriest late at night?"}
{"text":"One of the most disgusting places I have ever ate.This morning There awas a hair in my food,and on another occasion the waitress who just got of duty was sitting on the bench in the restaurant  with a young girl picking stuff out of her hair and flicking it on the floor.Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We were not greeted when we came in. There was a woman discussing her schedule at the register while one guy was obviously trying to ignore her and pay attention to the customer in front of him. In the process he noticed us and gave us a seat but after almost 10 minutes and no one showed up to take our order we just left. Sad thing is with all of the staff standing around chatting they didn't even notice."}
{"text":"This Denny's is located in the Empire Theatres Plaza in Whitby. We came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning and it was rather busy but they were able to seat us right away.  I've only ever been to Denny's once and it was in the states so when my boyfriend suggested we go, I was open to see what it was like. Although it was busy, we were seated right away and our waitress was over quickly to take our drink order. My only issue here was that when I got my tea, pouring water from the mini t  The menu here is pretty expansive, lots of choices, lots of options for healthier choices too. I ended up going with the Grand Slam which was three eggs with cheese, two links of bacon, two pieces of bacon and hashbrowns and toast. Our food arrived quickly, faster than I expected actually. Everything was good, fluffy eggs, tasty sausages, crispy bacon and these neat hashbrowns... love the hashbrowns.   Overall, for the price we paid and the amount of food we got, I'd come back here for sure and try something else off the menu. It's not terribly original or anything but it ticked all the boxes for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here.  The first time I thought it was because they were short handed but today I realized this place sucks.  First off it took forever to seat us. Once seated it took a long time to take our drink order.  Once our order came out it was all wrong. 2 out of the 5 drinks were right.  When our food finally came out it was cold. The kids nuggets were missing the ranch and bbq sauce. One was missing the yogurt.  The soup had a hair in it.  My salmon which I asked for with extra garlic had none.  Absolutely no seasoning.  I didn't eat it I gave it to my husband since his soup had a hair in it. By far the worst experience I've ever had at any Denny's location.  I would never ever come here again.  Sad part about this entire ordeal is that we are staying at Tahiti village which is on the same property and for this location to hv such bad service is uncalled for."}
{"text":"Our waitress Jody, deserves some recognition! If you need a dose of excellent customer customer service go request to sit in her section. Food was good, it did take a little long. But with customer service as good as it was we didn't mind at all."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and the experience was horrible. The bathroom was smelly, dirty and half broken down. We were seated at a table that wasn't ready as the menus sticked to the table, and no silverware. My wife had to wait 5 minutes to get silverware to stir her coffee. The food was obviously bottom of the barrel frozen garbage and the cheese seemed reconstituted from powder. There was no flavor at all. Asked for over hard eggs and got over easy....when I want solid eggs, and they come out runny that's a big deal. Wife's bowl was supposed to have chorizo but the cook put sausage instead. We were comped for her plate so I can't blame the servers but the food was horrible and I'm surprised the chef still has a job. If I Gould give 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"The food was fine. The service was spotty. They were nice enough when they actually got around to us. Our daughter never got all of her food. There were only three people working during the height of the weekend dinner rush. I guess overall it's exactly what you would expect to get out of a Denny's which ultimately makes reviewing this place completely asinine and pointless. But we definitely did not enjoy this experience."}
{"text":"Came in around 3am . Service was good , Elizabeth is very friendly and engaging . My friends enjoyed their food me on the other hand no so much . 2 friends ordered nachos and another order breakfast . No complaints .  I ordered chicken strips which in my opinion weren't cooked thoroughly . First and only bite I took I  could tell something wasnt right . It was still rubbery! Ugh .. so gross . Elizabeth offered to bring another order but I was skeptical of the cook's skills at that point ."}
{"text":"Great late night menu with not the usual Denny's selection. I believe it starts after 10 but it could be 11, I forget what time we got there.   My friend and I were working on a project and stayed for hours and they didn't mind at all. They just made sure to check on us and get us more drinks. It was the right environment for getting work done and still having a good time.  And yes open 24 hours on the north west side of town is a big plus in my book."}
{"text":"Its been awhile ive been here since idk last year well ordered country fried chicken from a $8 list it taste weird so i stop eating it i mean the price is low already but i wanted to subtitute my potatoes to a toast but the server said i cant do that like dude if i cant eat potatoes and take it out from my plate wanted a freaking toast instead like WHY NOT?! .. ordered an $2 french toast one slice .. full of butter melted on top i didnt know i thought they would put that on a side but then i CANT have a butter  .. but yeah .."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place... No matter what time of the day, I have been to this place, they always meet my expectations... Servers are friendly and professional, food is always on time. Plus they make the best make your own sandwich ever without forgetting anything or messing up :-)"}
{"text":"Horrible service on 5-4-2018 around 9pm. It took about 20 minutes for someone to take our order. When I asked for coffee I was told that they didn't have any coffee available because the weather was too hot.......ok I can understand that but if I ask for coffee why can't I just get my coffee? I got my coffee and food but no one ever bothered to check back and see if my food was okay or if I would like a refill. Definitely not the best service."}
{"text":"Server kept coming back and saying \"we'll be right with you\" its like really just Take our order already then we eventually got our order in after I got done eating I eat fast so when she came to get the plates she asked if my Grandma feeds me probably thinking she's my mom and doesn't feed me RUDE Customer Service the food was good But our waitress was very rude"}
{"text":"Oddly quite place! Best place to get a good cup of coffee at 2am ;)"}
{"text":"Good solid Denny's. I ordered the skillet and stayed full front it a long time plus it tasted good. Can't beat the prices for a sitdown meal. I'll be in agin. Thanks for taking great care of me."}
{"text":"Service was very poor. Three girls working for about 10 tables . We had to keep asking for coffee refills. The eggs were over cooked and the hash browns were stone cold. I now remember why I don't go to Denny's ."}
{"text":"Denny's is not my first choice to eat food. And after my experience at this location, I will not be returning. I met my friend and her kids on a Sunday evening . The staff was nice. We were seated right away. It was not busy, in fact we were the only ones eating. The server allowed me to order from the kids menu (which is a plus). I ordered the junior french toast for $4 which was supposed to have sliced bananas on top just like the menu stated and pictured. When I received it, it did not have the fruit. When I mentioned it, the server said it does not include it. But I said, the menu says it and pictures it, so I should get it. Thats false advertisement. She went back to kitchen an gave me the bananas and acted like she was doing me a favor. It was quite fustrating.   My friend ordered the spaghetti because she said she loved it from Denny's. She ate a majority of the dish. When she was at the bottom of the bowl she noticed a black speck. Thinking it was an herb, it was actually a piece of hair, we think it was an eyelash!! We told the server and no apology was given. She asked us to show her the hair! That was inappropriate and not customer service like. She offered to give another plate but we were disgusted and lost our appetites. There was no adjustment on the bill or any manager addressing the problem. It was extremely dissapointing!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Robert was awesome. Very attentive and helpful.  Honestly the best service we have received during our whole trip."}
{"text":"I don't know why this Denny's has such a low rating but we come here often. During our visits we have always experienced good service and good quality food. The manager is usually working when we visit and she is always so nice. This Dennys is located at a truck stop and is connected to a gas station. The dining room is huge, it maybe bigger than any of the others that I've been to. It's not a super busy location. We like to make it in during the week, on Tuesdays kids eat free."}
{"text":"At what point did dinning become bring your damn pets inside?? Why am I eating at a table while a dog is in the booth behind me SITTING IN THE SEAT. so great, now the next person will come and sit where the dog was sitting. How disgusting."}
{"text":"This is a very good Denny's restaurant. We came here several times, while staying near at the Plaza Hotel at the end of Fremont St. The management seem to have all very well under control, the staff is very friendly. The service is fast, the food is Denny's quality. Nothing to complain, if you go there you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Brandi is the server on weekdays. Therefore you should eat here on weekends or holidays. One coffee refill, and there were only four tables in the whole place, she wasn't even the only server!  The food was fine but one plate was cold, and no one asked, except the manager at the end, he didn't seem concerned when we said everything was simply \"Ok\".  The Pumpkin Coffee, which we have ordered several times, suddenly doesn't come with refills unless you pay, and she didn't tell us until after we drank the first cup. She did condescend to refill the cup with regular coffee, but let us know what an inconvenience it was for her.  Brandi sneezed several times, without covering her mouth, and never washed her hands. I'm sure she has a personality.... No I'm not, I'm not sure at all.  Final answer, ask for a different server, or drive to the one on Sahara."}
{"text":"9 pm is quiet and the service is great. Food is Denny's good and quick."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally come to a Denny's but I had some friends visit and they insisted we go here the morning after a night of drinking at UIUC.  It took about 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged at our table, and by that time we had been ready to order for a few minutes.  After that, he came back 5 minutes later and said he just put our order in. Why wouldn't it have been put in right away?  Our food took an unusually long time to come out, something close to 30 minutes. Most of us ordered breakfast foods that probably didn't need to be cooked very long. There also wasn't a ton of people in the store, so I'm not sure what could've went wrong.  The server was gone for a long time after that. Our food was brought to us by a guy who I believe was a busser or runner. Everyone's food was there, but they didn't bring a glass of milk my friend asked for with the meal.   I had a cobb salad and it wasn't bad, everything tasted fresh, and no complaints from my friends, albeit after looking at one's chicken fried steak myself, it didn't look that good at all. Another friend said his burger was good. It seems that most of Dennys' meals are approaching or exceeding the $10 mark. In my opinion the food quality is just not worth it at that price point. I can get comparable food on campus at Merry-Ann's for cheaper.  Anyway, the service troubles didn't end there. After we got and finished our food, our server was nowhere to be found. We waited over 30 minutes before he was back, and he apologized for being absent, and then brought us our checks.  Overall just really really slow service here. If we were in a hurry, we would've been screwed, thank goodness we had some time to kill.  Denny's to me is not a $10/plate restaurant.  2/5"}
{"text":"So I typically don't review a Denny's, but the food is way better lately. More specially Jeremy, the server has an energy and level of customer service typically reserved for restaurants with 4 dollar signs not 1. So the 5 stars, due 90% to the amazing service from Jeremy, and we now frequent and ask to only be seated in his section. And the other 10%? Kudos to the chef in the back for producing some pretty decent meals that 5 years ago I wouldn't have ever concluded came from a quick diner."}
{"text":"This is off the strip and worth the fifteen minute drive.... we were seated within 3 minutes, the service was amazing. Anna was very attentive to our party... The manager, Marvin even checked on our table to see if we were doing ok... The food was hot and ready within a few minutes of us ordering it... if you want great service and a great experience go off the strip and come here..."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast - fast and delicious. Location right next to my hotel :) Good French toast, bacon, eggs. Great and friendly service. Clean. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter to @DennysAllnightr for her Birthday Grand Slam.  Nobody came to the table for almost 20 mins.  Our server was Penny.  No coffee refills in the first 40 mins.  Time from placing order till delivered was close to 25 mins.  Food was same quality as always at Denny's, which is fine.  But the service was severely lacking.  I'm disappointed, even for Denny's."}
{"text":"We were very rushed today. We waited a bit for a table, but once seated, had no service for quite a while.  Lena came and inquired of our drink order has been taken. We told her it hadn't, and she offered to take it, while explaining how slammed they'd been, and that she'd been scheduled to leave at 6, but was staying to help out.  She offered to take our food order, and get it put in right away. We received our food very quickly.  The efforts of this wonderful woman made our day considerably less stressful, and she should be highly commended.  P.S. I love the new decor"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Denny's, because it was consistent. Not so much anymore...  We used to eat here a couple times a month.  The service is friendly, but when it gets to the point {during my last SEVERAL visits} of having to keep reminding the Food Server(s) for silverware, a take out box/bag, coffee refill, or that the order is incorrect, and even having to hunt them down for the bill, then it's time to start eating someplace else or even a buffet where I get my own things anyway.  I didn't bother telling them about all the bits of crunchy egg shells in my egg order or that they forgot my pancakes {again!}...during the last several visits, because I am the \"silent customer\" that just won't return.  Why bother with all of this hassle, when I can make my own breakfast at home for much less? I won't be returning back to this Denny's location. :("}
{"text":"I have eaten at this dennys several time and since i have had ok service and food in the past i give it 2 stars.  but had it been for this visit they would have got only 1 star.  Service was prompt and the ice tea was cold  beyond that they missed the mark.   i order the prime rib salad, but was very disappointed  I was with a freind of mine who goes there often and he said it was good, But mine was far from any thing......    i asked for no avocado and they got that right but they sure didn't look at the picture on the menu.  because they forgot the cheese, tomatoes, and couple other items .    the prime rib in the picture was mildly red centered which is how i like my steak, however the meat was past well done, (microwaved burnt), the bacon disinigrated to nothing, and for the $10 they charge the amount of lettuce it came with was very disappointing. i left there hungry.   It is sure a shame that a simple salad could be made so poorly   let hope some one gets some additional training at this location.  i guess i need to stick to the eggs and breakfast stuff when i go to Denny's."}
{"text":"Service was super slow due to our super slow waitress , cynthia.  She pretty much ruined my life. GO DENNYS!"}
{"text":"I don't think an example is needed to preface feedback for one of your employees genuine and helpful cheery attitude.  She exemplified a wonderful person capable of serving at her best.  She loves to serve people and make their day bright.  I enjoyed a wonderful interaction with her while she was on a slow night shift. Her capacity to interact with me and make me feel at home was a priceless level of service for a customer only ordering coffee.  I would guarantee she would be of equally great service with more responsibility which means the need for more customers to serve.  Dennys help make your employees successful and drive some sales."}
{"text":"Didn't have any t bone steak! Took about 25 minutes to serve me a double cheese burger. They didn't seem to be to busy. Never again will u step in here"}
{"text":"Ehhhhhh.... Service was ok and sadly the food was a bit under cooked and taste old. We should have honestly went to iHop. I will not recommend this Denny's to anyone. The waitress was great!"}
{"text":"Servers very patient and cheerful, coffee is delish! Dark roast with Hazelnut available yay;) I have to say it again.... This coffee is GREAT  Sadly service was slow but this was their first day so I will be back to try again another time."}
{"text":"Waiter mufasa was a great server prompt, food was like always good at Denny's Good to have one near our hotel stay this weekend!!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience. While we didn't wait long to get seated, we were served coffee out of a filthy mug and a hot chocolate that was half full. While the food wasn't horrible, the sticky table wasn't pleasant. Also, our waitress forgot a side of bacon and never provided a coffee top up. Ironic as my mug said \"at a diner a cup of coffee never goes empty\". Now twenty minutes later, my stomach hurts. Should've gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Meanwhile sitting in Denny's or \"Gay\"Denny's. Was greeted by some Caitlyn Jenner misfit. After being seated  water was promptly brought to the table. A few moments into conversation with my friends. The \"shift manager\" or the Caitlyn Jenner misfit yelled across the restaurant at another employee demanding table 10 to be cleaned. Poor girl wanted to loose it. She turned red. Everyone looked at her. I could run this shit show better. Might as well of gone to I-Hop."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Food came out cold and/or extremely greasy. Remakes were so late they came after everyone else was finished. The manager even continually screwed up the tickets. NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION. Wish I could leave a negative start rating because this location doesn't deserve even a \"no star\" rating."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and have usually been happy but it's been a while since I've been in.  We ordered normal breakfast food, grand slam, etc. nothing that should be that difficult. Well, after 30 minutes our food finally was brought over after sitting for 15 minutes in the window and everything on the plates was cold. Pancakes would not even melt butter.   It also seemed as if the people working there did not want to be there. The manager didn't appear all that friendly either which might explain why the workers were in such bad moods.  Next time we want food like that, we'll take our business to IHOPS."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! Slowest Denny's I have ever been to, and the place was filthy. The waitress kept telling me she couldn't take our order yet because she was busy. WTF?!"}
{"text":"We had stopped coming to Denny's a few years ago because we found the menu to be lacking. This last summer we started frequenting Denny's again while in San Diego and were lured back in because the food was so good with generous portions. It must be that the Denny's in California are better because we were really disappointed with this location. The fact that there was only one couple in the whole restaurant when we walked in should have been the first clue. While our waitress was nice and attentive, the food was just not up to par. The portions were extremely small to begin with. I ordered  a philly cheese steak sub with onion rings, well, I only got five onion rings. While five onion rings should suffice, these were small onion rings, really small. My plate looked so empty that they were awkwardly spread around the plate as to not make the plate look so empty. The same with the side of fries  my son got with his burger, although he ordered from the adult menu,they seemed like a kids order from McDonalds. I understand they follow portions but this was just ridiculous, it seemed as if the cook was paying out of pocket for our meal and that is why he skimped out so much. I'm sure our portions were below the standard they had to follow because it was just not enough. My husband stated his hash browns were horrible, he described them as having a texture similar to rubber. Needless to say, for the fifty dollar tab plus tip, it was just not worth it. I'm pretty sure we could of had a way better deal somewhere else and will once again stop frequenting Denny's. I think this time for good."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. We've gone here multiple times, at least 20 and each time, we get a different level of service. Most food is okay for the price but I'd rather not spend more time waiting for my food than enjoying it. They don't really listen to your requests but want a huge tip."}
{"text":"So we just went here and this has been in the top 3 for terrible experiences in eating out. We get there and are greeted by what I assume is the manager on duty, not wearing a name tag, with an attitude. She sits us down with an attitude, and walks away, also with an attitude. Anyways, so our waiter gets there and she's nice. She takes our order. I ordered the Bourbon Bacon Burger with no mushrooms, peppers, lettuce, or pickles. I receive my item with pickles. When I ask them to take it back and remake it without the pickles, all they did was take off the pickles. Like why in the world would you do that?! I could have picked them off myself but I wanted it remade because the thought of pickles makes me want to puke. I just took it because I was STARVING. The burger was not fully cooked, our waiter was not attentive. At the end, the manager rang us up, wouldn't talk to us, and entered our coupon in wrong, not only that she didn't give a receipt. To be honest, I'd be disgusted if I ever treated somebody as terribly as they did to us tonight. Absolutely a terrible terrible experience."}
{"text":"I've visited this Denny's every time I'm been to Vegas since 1999. Convenient location, decent prices for the Strip. Food standard Denny's, and I've had good service every time I've been there."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a Denny's.  It is not a restaurant at the Four Seasons!    But not all Denny's are created equal.   This restaurant has recently been updated and it is very nice.  It is very clean.   The servers seen to like their jobs.   While the food is general Denny's fare, they are constantly adding new menu items.   If you have not been to a Denny's for a while, give this one a try.  You will be pleasantly surprised.   Remember,  however,  it still is not the Four Seasons!"}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered nachos, cheese & bacon fries, and sample platter. Fast and friendly service. Clean dining area and restrooms. I live in the area so I will be back."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's, what can you really say? Food was exactly as expected, though I did enjoy their new coffee. The service at this location was great, and our waitress was super funny."}
{"text":"Folks, it's a Denny's! If you want high-class food, you can find it elsewhere...and you don't have to look very far. If you want to get good service from a waitress who has to deal with people who give her employer one- and two-star reviews as an occupational hazard, then come here and try to do so with the mindset that everyone around you is doing their very best.  Our server's name was Deja. Her service was prompt and courteous. We ate in relative comfort while she worked very hard to keep everyone here happy, including people who are impossible to please. We weren't impossible to please, so I want to end this review by saying how nice it was to receive such great service. Deja, I don't know where working here fits into your life plans...but the only way I could be happier with the breakfast me and my friend enjoyed here would be for me to return to Vegas in a few more years and see that the place has been renamed \"Deja's.\""}
{"text":"Went here this morning to kill time before heading to Toys-R-Us for my son's 4th birthday today. We get their and the hosted greeted us and asked my son how old he was, we told her he turned four today, she said order the Jr. Grand Slam for him and it'll be free. He ate almost all of it very good sized portions he had 3 silver dollar pancakes and scrambled eggs with bacon. I had biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs over easy and hash browns. And my dad had the Grand Slam with 2 eggs over easy pancakes, hash browns. It was all delicious. Would've had pictures but my phone died. Totally go here again, good priced food for good eats."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I've had at a Denny's. I've gone to the other Denny's in Arizona and my experience was opposite.   Took long to get our food. By the time we received it, all 6 of us received cold food. My sisters eggs were cooked on a dirty something because it had black burnt stuff and it wasn't pepper.   My other sister found a peace of clear plastic on her plate but It was toward the end of her meal-maybe she ate more without knowing it. It was probably a piece of the cooks gloves.  I wanted a refill of apple juice but they ran out.   Pro: service friendliness is 4 including concerned manager.   The food was horrible I feel like I was robbed.  I really wish I can be contacted by Denny's and be reimbursed with a gift card so I can visit my local Denny's in California."}
{"text":"The service here sucks.. keep forgetting the ihop is closer to the apartment..it just never fails when we come here really late the service just sucks.. and it's not like they are super busy.."}
{"text":"Not much to say. It's what you'd expect of a fast food-ish type place."}
{"text":"Denny's is what you would expect.  A lower quality iHop with lower prices. I love Denny's after a long night of drinking and partying. The food is good and the service is always great even though they look short staffed all the time. I would recommend Denny's to those looking for breakfast late at night and looking to spend under $6 for a meal. Other than that Sunrise Cafe, Egg Works, or iHop are preferred."}
{"text":"Where to begin.. when I first came at 3, I went to wash my hands. The hallway leading to the bathroom along with the men's restroom were apparently flooded, with just one wet floor sign holding the men's room door open. As I was walking back to my table, I almost slipped because of the water. I observed the waitresses, and it took about 45 minutes for it to finally get mopped up. If someone elderly person slipped on that, it could have been bad. It was pretty slow, maybe only 5 tables of patrons, and at least 3 waitresses, so it wasn't incredibly busy. Our waitress, a middle aged woman, was kinda passive aggressive. I get it, we all have bad days. I've worked in the food industry when it can be super busy and frustrating, but I've always tried to maintain a smile and not take it out on the guest. After waiting a considerable amount of time for the food (mind you it was not busy at all) the presentation was sloppy at best.  There were 6 tiny slices of banana on my salted caramel and banana pancake breakfast. I guess if I want quality I should stick to the Denny's in Tempe instead of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. But I am giving a four- for the service and food. Prices are insanely cheap and the service at the location was great. I was with family- about 7 kids under the age of 13 and the waiters/waitresses were so good with the kids and super fast with delivering meals. All around great family place, not crazy expensive and decent food."}
{"text":"First of all, they took long to get our order.  Spoon for my coffee was dirty, food was stuck to it. I showed the waiter and he told me to get the spoon from my silverware with an attitude.  My sister's cup was dirty, I scraped of old food from the cup with my nail. Horrible service and horrible attitude from the waiter."}
{"text":"We placed ourselves on the wait list and was told by the hostess or wait time would be less than 20 minutes.   Thirty minutes and three groups went ahead of us, so my friend went inside to check on the status of our seating.   To our shock,  the hostess started a new list.   No apologies for her error.  Brendan,our waiter, was friendly and nice. Our food was served fast."}
{"text":"Great service provided by our server Joanna. She was,friendly and professional. I would highly recommend her to anyone dining at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Average food, what you'd expect from any dennys. Music was a bit loud made it hard to carry a conversation.  What or should I say who makes this location 5 starts is the staff specially the host Joey amazing attitude and super friendly."}
{"text":"As I sit here...I say to myself  WOW!!!!!   INSTANT SERVICE  so friendly  and food spot on for Dennys  I usually go to local restaurants to eat...I like the atmosphere there...but this waiters are spot on...not just me I look at the service they give everyone else...clap clap clap!!! Keep it going guys...if ever I'm around I'll be back"}
{"text":"Came here after a long night of fun with a few friends. We stayed up all the way til 7am and decided it was time to eat. We made our way to this location since we were right by it and got a table for 3. We were helped right away as soon as we showed up. The food was great but one thing stood out. The server that helped us out seemed a bit annoyed for some reason but tried to disguise it. I asked for a couple things for the table and it seemed like she was trying to be smart about it for some reason. But any who, I won't let that ruin the review. I'm sure she was having a long day. Food was on point so I have no complaints here."}
{"text":"We were seated on Sunday afternoon at 5 o'clock there was four other tables that were occupied in the restaurant. we received our food at 615 after the manager came to the table and asked how we had enjoyed our food . we said we had not even got our food . they brought our food  and we finished eating at 20 minutes till seven .after we had asked for the bill twice  we paid .  we don't think will be going back .the food was excellent but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Waited for over 45 minutes for cold food. The waiter tried to make it right  it after the wait we was just done. He had the assistant manager Shelisa come over to try to make it right for us. She was rude to us and cut us off when we tried explain what was wrong with our order. Then she started to coach the waiter in front of us which was unprofessional and was very disrespectful to him and embrassing for us. Other waitress came over to our waiter after she walked away saying that she called her in the office and cussed her out because another table had a complaint.  By the way the excess for the wait was there was only one cook and there was nothing she could do about it. I'm sorry your the manager you get back there and help not hind in the office and watch tv on your phone (what the staff said she was doing) this is not the person I would have in a position to represent my business"}
{"text":"Nothing fresh! I ordered the rib salad, first serve those green leaves are \"bad \" . By bad I meant it already rots! Avocado is old and getting bad too. The only fresh thing might be the boiled egg. But who knows!  I will never come back to this Denny's  Besides, we refused to give tips for the bad experience the cashier brought up, are you sure that's how much you want to tip! Yeah, more than I wanted!"}
{"text":"They seat you very quickly even if the line is out the door, it's clean and food is great and workers are really nice. You order as soon as you sit and food is brought out quickly! No hangry people left"}
{"text":"Service was good. I had a very nice waitress named Andrea who was very attentive and friendly. Food, however, wasn't that great. I had a meat lovers omelette; it was extremely dry and tasteless. When I went to pay for my food, the hostess was \"busy\" and I waited 10 minutes for her to ring me up. She wasn't friendly at all and quite standoff-ish. The only smile I got while there was from my waitress. Paying $13 for a bad omelette and drink definitely wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Terrible to-go orders. I mean what was I expecting, someone to care about what I ate? The fries were crusty musty dried up burnt as heck WITHOUT THE SEASONING WHICH IS THE BEST PART along with some small shriveled again dried up chicken tenders. The to-go box was burnt through like the cook just threw fries straight from the fryer after he realized they had been cooking for a long time. I did get a free big bowl of ranch so that's a plus since I like ranch. Really sucked because I literally waited all day long to get some buffalo chicken tenders and Dennys is the only place I know of. Screw you Portillos for not having buffalo sauce!"}
{"text":"What a great crew of hard working nice kind people.  If you have ever served in a restaurant you should see them ramp up from quiet to fast w o missing a step.   Food was fast reasonable hot and good.  I had an egg white omelette w veggies and swiss cheese hash brwns wng muffin but w whole eggs and a side of fresh sliced avocado a d delish hot coffee"}
{"text":"Staff were nice and curteous . Food was good . This was the best Dennys I have ever been to. I highly recommend this Dennys.  Eventhough very busy. Both food and service were very good."}
{"text":"Went here for My Wife Bday breakfast the staff was great made us feel like we belonged. And the menu has changed since I ate at Denny's last so much better solut√®. Philly cheese steak yumm"}
{"text":"This Denny's is 24 hours and connected to the Sandman Hotel.  I ate here a few times since I was staying at the hotel.  The first time was for dinner and we arrived to find a handful of other customers.  The server was decent and brought us our drinks promptly.  We ordered our food and it took a little bit longer to come out that I expected for 9PM.  I ordered the 'thanksgiving' dinner sandwich which comprised of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sandwiched between 2 pieces of grilled bread.  It was a bit greasy but I did like the combination.  It was to come with gravy but I didn't get any nor did it need it.  Based on this, I would rate it 3 stars.  The next visit was for breakfast.  If you're looking for a quick breakfast, you would be better off at one of the nearby fast food places.  There were 2 servers for 7 tables or so but the service was slow.  The one waitress didn't seem very friendly either.  Since most of the meals are 'big breakfastes', I ordered one of the smaller meals that came with 2 pancakes, 2 sausages, eggs, and hashbrowns.  The pancakes were ok but not as fluffy as I like.  Everything else was too greasy, including the eggs.  I ate half my meal but that was enough.  I'm not a fan of Denny's and would rather pick other places to eat but I did like the convenience."}
{"text":"Typical Denny's experience, service is a little below par and the food was okay. I would recommend it if it's late night or a cheap quick breakfast!  What I ate: The Slamwich: It was a good sandwich, great if you're comparing it to fast food, so it is a step up. I got it with seasoned fries (I love the seasoned fries from Denny's, they are great! Definitely recommended)   Overall, typical Dennys experience. Okay food, okay service. You're in and out! Consistent."}
{"text":"If you want a server to get your order wrong then claim she didn't hear, this your place. Please make sure you check your bill!  Never again... terrible experience."}
{"text":"Place was not busy. Was helped right away but towards end of meal. Did not have any server help to see if we need anything else or everything was ok...we sat for a good 10-15 mins after eating while seeing servers past and talk while waiting to end their shift while we had our table with plates piled to show we were done and still no help with a bill on sight. Not be back here again."}
{"text":"Must of called 15 times within 20 minutes to make takeout order. No answer to majority of calls, could of sworn someone picked up and hung up the phone purposely on me multiple times.   After one last try, a lady picks up finally and I tell her I've called for the last 20 minutes with no answer and she immediately becomes rude and unfriendly with no apology for the inconvenience. She gets snappy demanding me to order and I tell her I will just call a different location.  Won't be ordering, maybe not even dining here at this location again. Very unprofessional and rude."}
{"text":"Too many servers for the amount of ppl in there. Didn't get drinks till after food. All food came out separate. Couldn't eat as family all at once. It was a mess."}
{"text":"We come here a lot. It's kid friendly & we always get good service.  It's a great way to take the kids. And today we have 7 with us!"}
{"text":"Best Denny's I've ever been too. People in Pittsburgh can teach Cali folks a thing or two. Great service, amazing food (for Denny's). Rita sat us and was all smiles and really friendly and Patty was our waitress. Incredible how an experience changes when people actually love their job or at least take pride in it. It shows. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I normally Don't write these kind of reviews but our server we had here was great. I wish I could remember his name. His was so good to me and my family. We came in on a Friday night. I came here specifically for the pumpkin pecan pie pancakes and let me tell your they were delectable. By far the best pancakes I had in a while because of the glaze on top. They. Could have been fluffier but this is dennys people. I'm not expecting five star pancakes but they were pretty good. My grandma is old school and likes breakfast at all meal times especially when you can pick 4 items for under $5. So on this rainy  Friday evening this was perfect. Service was great. Our server was very attentive. If they had these pancakes all year round I'd probably order more but they're seasonal. Until neat year dennys."}
{"text":"So usually this place is great but today, they have messed up our order 3 times and forgotten our appetizer. Today was the worst experience I've ever had here. Would usually give 5 stars for this place but today I don't even want to give them one star."}
{"text":"The coffee here is really good. Their prices are very reasonable and you get a good variety of breakfast items for the price. I love the choices I can get on their grand slam."}
{"text":"Responding to James a review. Perfect analogy. It's Denny's. Service was prompt and friendly. Wait time for food was minimal. Everything was hot and cooked properly. It's Denny's and will return when I want that experience."}
{"text":"They don't have the standard value menu which is dumb, and they didn't give us silverware until after the food was here... On top of that, not mentioning that a substitution is going to cost an extra $1.30 for a chicken sausage and then saying that I should know it costs extra...whack.  Definitely not a Grand Slam, more like a strike out."}
{"text":"Was here last night for a Grubhub delivery. At first, things were slow and disorganized.  Then, Alex took over. She went above and beyond to help out with to-go orders, assuring everyone was taken care of in a timely fashion, all while serving her section, which was fairly busy.  Alex was polite, fast, and professional.  (Also, easy on the eyes.)  This girl deserves a raise and made my trip to Denny's a much better one than it could have been otherwise."}
{"text":"Definitely skip this place and head to one of the many other options they have in Vegas.  My friends and I were hungry around 2 or 3 am and this was one of the places near our hotel that was open.  When we got there, the place was about half full, but they still made us and a couple of other parties sit at the front and wait for a table.  After about 10 minutes of waiting, we were finally sat.  And then we sat and sat and sat.  Finally we were able to flag a waitress down who told us that she wasn't our waitress and was actually not on shift but would help us out (although we did see her serving a number of other tables so not sure what that was about).  We put in our order and then waited some more.  Finally the food arrived, and it was fine.  Standard Denny's food, nothing that is going to amaze you.  After eating, we had to wait some more for the check.  We then walked up to the front to pay so we could finally leave.  The whole thing took over an hour just to have some breakfast food.  I would not recommend coming here if you are hungry, because be prepared for a long wait and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours so you always have a place to drag your drunk ass to when you get the munchies.  Depending on which location you go to, the service is pretty great, the waiters and waitresses are nice. Except at the location on Charleston by CSN, they're pretty grouchy there. I guess I could complain about the people that eat here, but there's not much to be done about that, cause there's assholes everywhere you go.  The food is great, especially the slam meals, and I liked when they had the Hobbit menu, those red velvet pancake puppies were a work of genius. I wish they would bring them back cause I'd eat them everyday and gain 30 pounds. On second thought, maybe a good idea they got rid of them."}
{"text":"The worst Denny's. Both food and service. Do know how do they managed to run the place in the Venetia Hotel Campus..."}
{"text":"In all my 38+ years eating at Denny's I've only ever had to send something back on two separate occasions. I have NEVER in my life had to send something back 2x! and I've NEVER had to send a simple burger back!  Shockingly I had to send my burger back not once, but twice and then after speaking to the manager I ended up taking home a Super Bird that was barely edible. My Dad's Chick Fried Steak was crummy too.  Here's the scoop on my meal.. I order a Western burger which comes with tangy steak sauce drizzled over Onion Tanglers¬ô and melted Swiss cheese.  My plate finally arrives, they were rather slow, and the 1st thing I notice is a pile of black/brown crumbles next to the burger and that my fries are a pale cream color and look to be barely cooked. I lift the top bun and find about 1/2 a hamburger patty, and that 1/2 is completely falling apart, and several of the \"onion tanglers\" are burnt black.   I realized the crumbles I see on the side are PART of the rest of my hamburger patty. I call my waitress back (amazed that she served me this thing in the 1st place) and she says, \"oh do you want me to have the cook make you another hamburger patty?\" I say, uh yeah, thinking did she just say hamburger PATTY? It takes at least another 10 mins. There are maybe 15 guests in the whole restaurant and only 1 cook.   So the waitress comes back and says with a flourish, \"he made you a whole new burger\" like that is something remarkable. I'm looking at the thing which yeah it has the basics on it like lettuce, but there is no \"tangy steak sauce drizzled over Onion Tanglers¬ô and melted Swiss cheese\" and I immediately notice this hamburger patty is falling apart too!   So I then ask for the manager and I point at both burgers and ask her, would you eat either one of these? She was very apologetic and offered to have something else made, a sandwich maybe? (Clearly the cook is having a serious problem cooking an actual hamburger patty.) So I ask for a Super Bird and ask for it to-go since my Dad had finished eating about 5 min before they brought me the 2nd burger. I take the meal home, the sandwich was terrible, it too was falling apart, I was just amazed. I ate 1/3 of it just because I was so hungry and threw away the rest  It was crazy and my waitress was a complete idiot. I was very nice to her, since she was clearly clueless and young, so I just told her straight that I was amazed she served me the 2nd burger since it wasn't what I ordered and had much the same problem as the 1st one. She said sheepishly, \"I wanted you to know I was trying\". I told her if you're having issues like this with the cook you need to make sure the manager knows.  By far the WORST experience @ Denny's EVER. And the meal was already free from the Casino so you know it was really bad for me to complain."}
{"text":"Be me, 22M full time student no job  Thursday hits hit up Denny's with the bros for the weekly Godly worship   Server comes around, super friendly, everyone orders food finally server get to me I look around at my friends putting on a strong face nothing wrong (don't show them how you feel inside)  I'M  NOT FINE INSIDE, it's 10pm been studying and going to my hospital clinicals all day no food in my belly no cash in the bank to even feed myself off the 2/4/6/8 menu (I have bills to pay)  I secretly check my bank apps in hope to find the funds to wave down the server to order some food  But it's over the server brings out the food, funds unavailable for myself I look in horror as my friends stuff their face and I'm left hungry another Thursday night.  Gone every Thursday to Denny's coming out depressed and starving... The only thing I see from Denny's to this day is depression."}
{"text":"We were hungry and had a good experience. Mike was very busy and it showed but he kept that smile on his face each time he came to table. Experience would have been 5 stars because food was fast, tasty, fair price, and server was nice.  But, Bailey the cashier, was not friendly at all. I am hoping that is not the norm. But I will be back."}
{"text":"My uncle and I went here 3 times a week after his kidney treatments.  the service was friendly and quick (my uncle is very impatient) and the food was hot and fresh and the waitress made sure our coffee cups were always full.  My uncle has passed but I take my grandchildren there better their kids menu and at certain times kids eat free and their $2-4-6-8 menu choices it is affordable to take the kids."}
{"text":"We just left.the food was terrible and thats putting it nicely. I had the turkey dinner it was cold and the stuffing was very very salty.they were out of a lot of things. My wifes cheese mashed potatoes were crunchy her fish was raw and chicken stripes were burnt.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with a group of nine people. It was around noon on a Sunday and we knew there would be a wait. They offered us two booths that weren't even directly across from each other, which we declined. Then a perfect spot opened up, and they seated people who were behind us in line in it. Apparently the manager had decided to place us in one specific spot, and that we could just wait until it opened up. So, we left. In past visits, service has been fairly poor (drink refills are harder to come by than he 's teeth) and the food takes a REALLY long time to come out."}
{"text":"Denny's is typical. Went 2 mornings in a row! No problems. They have items labled GF for gluten free and the gluten free english muffins were pretty tasty. Servers both times were nice and friendly."}
{"text":"They didn't post the wait time correctly.  Our waitress was good but my country fried steak and eggs were horrible. The steak looked and tasted like the \"steak\" fingers served in elementary school. Horrible. My over easy eggs were well done. The yokes were cooked through and through."}
{"text":"Visited here with a friend on a Friday afternoon. It was pretty slow inside, not too many people. Yet I felt like we waited around more than we needed to. There was only one waiter to service everyone there. Food was ok , nothing special."}
{"text":"This Denny's use to be a favorite for my children and I, but I had a bad experience with one of the servers who made me question if the color of my skin would distract her from giving me quality customer service.  This is not typical of restaurants in the Valley, but if the manager of the store chooses to hire people who have these views, this is not a place I can frequent.  My children are precious to me and I want them to have the best experiences here."}
{"text":"Every time I visit this Denny's, I have a familiar thought... Why am I here??!?  The service is always slow.  It seems very understaffed.  The servers are often rushed and spread too thin, which means that I've often gotten cold or incorrect food.  I'm sure I'll return, though, and wonder why I'm there.  I guess that's how dining at Denny's is... Is it really ever a deliberate choice??"}
{"text":"It took ten minutes to just get a water and Coke. Patiently waiting, the manager Erin was arguing with his employees in the back. \"BAM!\" My heart skipped a beat. My friend ducked in fear. Erin had punched the wall.. I noticed how stressed out he was so I just shook it off and let it slide. But then, within minutes, the yelling started again in the kitchen and \"BAM!\" Erin punched the wall again. Erin had the audacity to come and apologize for the slow time but I'll never forget the striking sound and the pain the wall had to go through. It was a very uncomfortable experience. Very unprofessional for a manager."}
{"text":"It was clean & yummy. A few good lite menu options along with the ol' fave breakfast all day. Other half got the maple bacon sundae & it was dang good... I was a skeptic at first, but ended up eating it with him. Welcome back Denny's!"}
{"text":"Not a good location on a busy Saturday morning. Wait for meal over 30 minutes, food extremely greasy to the point of bringing one to feel nauseous, boiled eggs not fully cooked...the service was like hailing a cab- could barely find our waitress for napkins or the condiments we requested with our meal nearly 40 minutes later. We consumed Less than a quarter of our meal. Not worth the time."}
{"text":"It took 30 minutes to get our food and we hardly saw our waiter. The food ended up being gross and cold. They ended up giving us a 20% off discount off our entire order but the service & food was pretty much terrible. Never again."}
{"text":"Hey, it's Denny's.  Fair food at a fair price.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Food was good but the servers are too busy to care about anything. This Denny's location is right off Fremont right in the middle of all the action. We went here while waiting for my brother in laws next baseball game. The amount of people that were here was insane. The servers were so stressed they were rude and not caring. I would try to pick a less busy location."}
{"text":"Went there for my brothers birthday he had a email for a free grand slam we showed it to the server and she said they would take it off at the front. When we went to leave they wouldn't take it off without seeing his ID witch he doesn't have because he's underage, so we ended up paying for the meal witch is shitty on there part 7$ wouldn't of hurt them to take off the meal, food took forever to come out and the managers are stupid"}
{"text":"So I have never been a patron of their dine in service, but recently had to do a pick up for this restaurant and needless to say, I think they need to revisit how they do pick ups. They should have an area where they keep the food warm for pick ups. I got there and the food was just sitting there getting cold on the front counter and to add matters worse the waitress was not paying any attention to the front, so I waited a good 5-10 minutes by the time I got any service."}
{"text":"How many times and how many ways can one restaurant fail???? You would think that a rest. with a corporate structure would find a limit...... But NOOOOOOOOOOO not this location! Everytime I come they are out of SEVERAL things. The service is slow and poor. I'm over it!"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible waitress service. Forget it if you want a refill of hot coffee. No check up to see how it taste...but no problem with leaving the check."}
{"text":"Got to dennys and their was a ten minute wait then it was change to a twenty minute wait which was understandable tons of people flock to Denny's after their long nights the other two we had gone two were pack as well no biggie.  Our waitress was not that cool with us she was some what annoyed with us again this many people could be overwhelming for some people not me I used to be in the business so I know how it is.  After bring the drinks she brought to cups both had lipstick wtf that's crazy not that the dishwasher did not wash them well the fact that she did not check them that's the sign of a lazy person seriously the out right don't care about their job but even that did not pissed me off I simply got a styrofoam cup and had my boy drink it from their  wait time on food after ten table and I am not lying I would never do that on purpose 40 minutes that would have simply been enought but we stay and had our food debating on whether I should tip her or just say fuck it I am out because I would never come here again. 20minutes since the last period I just don't understand how now that I am done eating the entire restaurant has all new tables while we are still here this is no be I am serious I read your reviews while I was waiting outside and I could not believe the peoples comments now that we are done eating she just came and said the following I WENT AHEAD AND TOOK 15% OFF YOUR BILL AND YOUR JUICE AND SOME PUPPIES ARE ON THE HAUSE SHE ALSO APALOGIES FOR THE INCONVENIENCE I GUESS THATS COOL BUT SERIOUSLY I WOULD NEVER COME BACK. I AM SORRY KIARA (OUR WAITRESS)BUT MAYBE TODAY WAS NOT YOUR DAY. Maybe family wants to leave a tip DONT KNOW WHY"}
{"text":"I'm giving Denny's 3.5 stars.   I crave pancakes now and again. Denny's brings back memories of being in Winnipeg on a cold night and amusing myself by saying 'slam' a bunch of times while leading through the menu.   I have frequented this location a handful of times. I like coming here before or after a movie, or simply because I want pancakes.   It's nice when the greeter knows that you are approaching the door. It automatically opens. It makes me feel special!  On Monday, I took a day off from work and had lunch here. There was a new variety of pancakes. I went with the sticky cinnamon bun pancakes with toasted pecans. OMG! So delicious! The pecans were buttery and crunchy. I loved the pancakes. I could eat them all day, but I'd have to exercise till eternity. I can't do that.   Oh, it also came with two eggs, hash browns, and your choice of sausage links or bacon. My server suggested that I could a bit of both breakfast proteins. So, I did. Yummy!  I do miss the grits that you could get In the past. I'm not crazy about hash browns. They tend to be way too crispy for my liking. So, I ate all the non-crispy ones.   My server was wonderful. I like this location. There's free wifi.   (218)"}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.  I was out and about shopping on Sunday. I then realized that I was hungry and it was nearly 3 pm. I was on highway 407. I exited at Airport Road. I did a quick search on my GPS and this Denny's came up. I headed over there.  I have a weakness for Denny's. I have fond memories of going there in Winnipeg.  This Denny's is located in a plaza. The parking lot was busy, but there were plenty of spaces to park.  I walked in and was promptly seated at a booth. I had a friendly, polite server taking my order and serving my food.  I went with the French toast slam, which comes with sausage, bacon, and your choice of eggs. I went with scrambled.  My server was attentive getting my Diet Coke, asking if I needed any butter, and whether I wanted dessert. I wish that I could have had the apple crumble, but I was stuffed.  He was helpful letting me know that the wireless payment machine would give me a number of different prompts before I could insert my debit card. He was great.  This restaurant was fairly busy on a Sunday afternoon. There were many crying kids and large groups of folks talking loudly. If you want peace and quiet, this place isn't for you on a Sunday afternoon. Otherwise, if you enjoy decent food, especially French toast, come here.  (141)"}
{"text":"I have been a member of a club that has met there for many years. Now we are being asked to leave, originally it was because of financial considerations. And then we were hustled out for a \"corporate\" meeting. We were told it would start at 9 am.. at 5 minutes to 9, there was no one around... no place settings. Now we find out the private room will be remodeled and changed to a public area. We shall see.   I don't feel that Denny's is a caring partner to local business or  the local non profits.  Management appears uncaring, they even suspended our waitress.... alot of negative changes since they hired Alex the manager... I probably won't be back. I don't feel valued anymore."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to get my windows tinted on my new car today and the service was pretty fast but the reason for only 4 stars is the waitress was a bit all over the place with bringing our food but, had to wait on the pancakes instead of bringing them with our order & when asking she said don't worry they're coming SMH we had a good breakfast overall though and will be back"}
{"text":"This was a extremely disappointing visit. From the time I walked in until the time I left there wasn't anything that would be good to say about our visit. The facility was very poorly maintained and stuck like something was wet. I ordered a orange juice that was flavorless. My main course wasn't far behind that bacon over cooked so much that it broke just trying to pick it up and my pancakes were smothered in fudge.... We differently won't be revisiting a denys for a very long time. And they only reason they received one star is because they won't let me not put a star."}
{"text":"This restaurant takes for ever to call you. Came in lady said 30 minutes been waiting for about 1hr and nothing. Another lady came out and finally said they dont have 1 table but if i wanted to wait or they could give me 2 booth i said no ill take booth so now lets see how long they take to call us to sit"}
{"text":"If I could deduct additional stars here, I would. Worst Denny's Ive ever been to. Long ass wait time and we ask for 2 coffees and 3 waters, what we get is 2 coffees, no water. We ask again and nothing. Finally the food comes and we have to ask again! We waited about an hour to an hour and a half for 3 plates of food and the order wasnt even correct! Not to mention it was a plate full of grease, overcooked bacon and the eggs werent even cooked right. I hate negative reviews but this place needed one...BAD."}
{"text":"Super fast service, generous portions! I love Denny's!"}
{"text":"I placed an order online for pickup and pre-paid. When I arrived the person at the counter was incredibly rude and just stated \"nope, don't see an order for you\". I asked what the problem was and she angrily stated there was no problem, there just wasn't anything for me. Finally the manager came over, was very kind and began to look for my order. Apparently they gave it to someone else. I demanded a refund and they stated that they would reverse the charge to my account, but I have yet to see it go through. There was no offer of compensation or gift card. I will NEVER give this restaurant my business again."}
{"text":"Placed an order today for 2 salads.  Waitress came by after about 5 minutes, we are out of a certain cheese for the salad, can we sub?  Sure, its just cheese.  So after another 15-20 minutes she comes and says we are out of dried cranberries for the salad.  Thats a ridiculous amount of time for a salad, there were maybe 5 tables of people.  We said sorry, we are outta here.  Waitress hurried over to the manager who was eating in a corner booth to tell him we were leaving.  He didnt get up or seem to be worried, he continued eating.  Cross this location off your list.  Service times are always long, not sure if its the kitchen or the wait staff."}
{"text":"The best, never had a bad experience here, they know me here and treat me well, the food is the way it looks in the photo and the service is outstanding every time, unrivaled. Love coming here and enjoying my breakfast with coffee and read the news on my cnn app. This is the way Denny's is SUPPOSED to be."}
{"text":"I just got to say I had a terrible experience at this Dennys location. For i to say the server was not that great service was terrible food was good but are order was messed up. Ok so first ima begin on the table there like a 3 dollars donation I think to feed the kids charity thing that they have so let explain this you give 3 dollars and you get coupons I think it was like 5 coupons one of was buy 20 dollars worth of food and get 5 dollars off. So I ask the lady can   I pay 3 dollars and use this coupon for today and the lady said I don't know I'm not sure so I told her can you find out for me she said ok I will after coming to are table 4 to 5 times she never told me anything so she forgot. A other than I ask for napkins she left and help 3 other people pass are table and help the person. Next to us and still haven't got ate napkins. Till she came back to are table and ask up do you need anything and my mom said tobacso sauce than I said I still need my napkins. So for a while she didn't give us are napkins than we finally received it. A other thing I order a sprite never got offered a refill after she came to are table lots of times and my sprite was empty most of the time. I didn't like her attitude her name was marie. There was others things that happend but ima leave to this. My check number was 658454"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS DENNYS AT ALL COSTS! If you'd actually like to eat and drink anything anytime soon, please go somewhere else. You'll thank me later. The waiters stand around and play with one another and avoid eye contact with patrons. The manager included. Do yourself a favor and find something else to eat. Thanks for nothing Dennys. Shut it down and build a parking lot. JJ was our waiter... If you get JJ as your waiter, get up and LEAVE! Seriously!!"}
{"text":"Large portions at a low price. Food was hot and tasted good. Was very happy to be leaving with a full tummy for 13 bucks."}
{"text":"Very close to the Arizona Grand Resort.  Took basketball team there for a meal in a hurry.  Waitress staff helped us wonderfully with our large broken up order."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of Denny's but came for a free birthday breakfast since it's close to my house.   Haven't had it in a while and I thought the pancakes were actually better than IHOP.  This location was clean and the waiter was friendly."}
{"text":"What can you say about Denny's - the food is what it is, its breakfast food. As long its not completely messed up, you cant really have any complaints. Service is what determines the customer satisfaction at places like Denny's.   We had pretty good experiences with Denny's, in general, at various locations. So we were excited to see a location open up in Champaign. We have been there many times by now. The service was acceptable. Depends heavily on who is attending to you and what mood they are in. But overall, we didnt have many complaints.   There was one instance when we ordered the milkshake, she gave us just the serving glass and did not give the mixing glass with the \"extra\" which they claim to be part of the order. The overall experience on that day was below par.   The wait staff definitely needs more training in doing their work and keeping customers happy. They come in knowing what the food is going to be like, make them come back and keep the place running with a good customer service. Not sure why it is so hard to understand this simple logic."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times and it was great Everytime. It seems to get a bum rap as they say. I took my 1 year old grandson the last time and his little meal was free! The food was good and the service was great. I will go again soon it's not crowded most of the time great bfast my waitress was nice and cute lol"}
{"text":"One server for a room full of customers and to top it off the server is not in a good mood  .....Nice move Denny's Skip this Denny's not worth it"}
{"text":"This is the best Denny's you will ever visit- from a guy who has been to dozens throughout the United States.   The restaurant is huge, beautiful, and always very clean. The service is usually very good, and the team of managers, servers, and cooks at this location is just top notch. I am a regular customer during the graveyard shift and visit once in a while during the mornings and afternoons. I really enjoy eating, studying, and hosting guests at this Denny's.  The food is pretty typical of Denny's around the U.S., but at this location you can rest assured that it is fresh food prepared on a very clean line by people who care about how it comes out.  My favorite thing about this Denny's is the personal touch. The managers and servers go out of their way to spend time with customers and to be great hosts. Among the managers, Lacey and Liz are outstanding. They do a great job with their staff and are popular with customers. The graveyard servers are all stars and take great care of us overnighters- ask for Maria and Sheree late night. My cup is always full and there is always a great conversation to be had. I sometimes visit in the morning or afternoon with kids. The kids love Brandon when we visit in the afternoons- he treats them so well!   Overall this is a great place with a great vibe. I really enjoy this Denny's and have never really had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a good Denny's in quite awhile. I was happily impressed with this particular Denny's. The food is well presented, served quickly and Anna and Feliciano are great servers. Their prime Cobb salad is amazing and low carb friendly. This location is super clean and it doesn't seem to be too busy."}
{"text":"My usual dining spot after Friday night pyro; the location is clean and staffed by friendly people. Our orders are filled correctly, and the food is tasty. I recommend the pumpkin pancakes if you're here during the right time of year."}
{"text":"I order a to go order of Caesar Salad, then when my husband got there they had no Caesar dressing, shouldn't they have known that when I ordered it? I order it there all the time... not happy.This is the second time we have had a problem. They was nice and fixed the problem  the 1st time. But how does a restaurant run out of salad dressing?"}
{"text":"Oh I did not forget to post this aweful experience and it happened Easter Sunday!  Well we waited 10 minutes before anyone realized we were there and ordered our drinks.  We got our food order taken and waited forever and a day to get that .....geez!   My fiance complained to the waiter and the waiter just rolled his eyes, no sorry just attitude.  Not to mention all the knats all over and attacking our food!  The waiter placed my fiance's ice tea on his smartphone!  Oh my fiance Stephen was really mad over that one!  We sure will not be turning to that Denny's!!"}
{"text":"This Dennys keeps getting worse and worse and worse. We come here often because it's close to my father in law's house. While it's convenient, it continues to be a nightmare. Today took the cake.... The server completely messed up my father in laws order, and never apologized. Then, only after he had to keep asking for forgotten items, did she offer to provide a discount. Then, she asked how he was doing and he told her the truth about how he didn't get anything he ordered, and she just walked away with out saying a word... Never to be seen again. I've had it with this Denny's. I am never going back again. Horrible service, the food is always cold when it comes out, and it's tiring."}
{"text":"Been at this location twice already, first time It was an easy 4 star, second time a solid 2. Food - always decent, I was never disappointed from their food in the past as well, some things are really good and some are OK but never less than that. Service - first time was a really great service, we were a big group of people and we got top notch service, the second time the service was an absolute disaster!! It took them 10 min to get our order for drinks and she refused to take our order for food claiming she is coming back in a sec. I called her multiple times and she only came back to our table after about 15 min ( I thought it was an hour really). I was really hungry and this wait made me craaaazy mad... You know how it is."}
{"text":"Been going since day 1.... all my positive comments and pictures brought everyone in... now the food takes forever to arrive the food is wrong and in poor shape, yeah servers reduce the price, but it's not what I wanted to eat... clientele has changed... I'll just stay in bed and go to coras in the morning"}
{"text":"When you walk into a Dennys, it's not like you expect top end food and service. It's a big chain, middle class taste, nothing fancy for a decent price. Having said that, I at least expect that what they do, they should do right. Not so much, here today. My 9 year old wanted a Belgian waffle and bacon. I ordered a strawberry pancake combo. Took quite a while for it to come out. While my food was okay at best, his waffle came out crispy (too much time under the heating lamp is my guess), his bacon burnt. The manager was swinging through soliciting feedback, so I told him the problem. Dead eye stare, no apology, but at least they offered to take his waffle back or refund it. We took it off the bill. Low expectations met."}
{"text":"The food was good and the establishment was nice. The service however was terrible. The servers and staff were extremely unattentive. I went here with my Grandfather for lunch and we were left seated and waiting just to order drinks for about 10mns, and after that we had to wait another ridiculous amount of time to order and the servers pretty much ignored us."}
{"text":"We usually go here because of the clean and friendly service. Although tonight the service wasn't at it's peak and the server forgot to bring some of our stuff until we asked. I understand being a serve myself when it's busy it can be a little hectic. Our appetizer was cold and the soda tasted more like water then soda. They were very helpful in replacing the drink. We will be going back again."}
{"text":"It wasn't my choice to eat here since there are so many other places to eat in Vegas. Plus, I hate eating at most chain restaurants. But we wanted breakfast food around 1pm and this was the closest place to our hotel that was still serving breakfast.   And it was totally worth the wait! I forgot how greasy, delicious and cheap the breakfast items were! It definitely satisfied my craving for eggs, bacon, pancakes, covered hash browns, and toast."}
{"text":"Shoutout to Gissel. I really hope I spelled it right . She deserves a raise. She's very quick and attentive and super sweet. She never even showed an ounce of annoyance like some servers in the past at other places when I asked her if I could get my hash browns cooked longer.   French toast slugger was So good. My husband really enjoyed it. And he got an extra side of French toast for just $2  I got the banana cream pancake breakfast. Everything was perfect. Make sure to ask for your hash browns extra crispy or else they'll come like I. The picture but it was no problem switching it out. So my review stays as 5stars. I couldn't blame them because I love everything almost burnt. Especially toast !!! Yummy but the flavor of everything was DIVINE. And the caramel comes on the side so you determine how sweet or unsweet you want it."}
{"text":"This was a Sunday night, and I don't know if it is always like this, but the service and the food were truly first class."}
{"text":"Victoria on the phone is a very rude person. She claimed she would call back to make sure the number I gave was correct. She never called back. I had to call back twice just for her to say \"you're going to have to come in and order\" and rudely hung up."}
{"text":"Great food, larger than normal portion sizes of hash browns, and great service! One of the best dennys I've been to."}
{"text":"I ordered the Steak  Skewer Skillet, looks nothing like the picture. That's not real steak you get served, just something that looks like meat. There is no zucchini nor squash as advertised online and in their menu, ZERO. Everything else was mush, including the five bits of green and red peppers. The three paper thin slices of mushroom was a surprise.  My wife ordered the Blackberry Pancake Breakfast. Another disappointment. Server brought out her food with no Blackberries. Just plain old pancakes. Told her they ran out. Asked her to choose another topping. That would mean it's a completely different dish.    Disappointing food with bad service."}
{"text":"This place is realy busy and the hostess seems lovely.   While I waited for my takeout,  I witnessed one staff member named Kim complain to the kitchen about making smoothies and overall have a terrible attitude.  Another one got really frustrated because she couldn't find the map that shows her section.   They could probably benefit from an active manager that actually is around when the restaurant is busy."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service sucked. Waitress forgot about us and we had to wave down another one for a to-go order which should have been placed a long time ago. Now we have to wait for 4 orders to be filled before ours and we have been sitting here done with our meal for 20 minutes. Oh and they forgot about our bread which is supposed to be included with our meal. All we got was \"sorry\"."}
{"text":"Worst dennys experience ever. I normally wouldn't even waste my time doing a review on a dennys but don't waste your time or money coming here. Go directly across the street to IHOP. We waited over an hour for a waffle and a pancake breakfast. After an hour and 10 minutes the cold waffle arrived but still no pancakes. Waffle was ice cold. Never received our milk shake and had to ask for more Coffee and water. We actually got up and walked pit after sitting there with a cold waffle for over 5 minutes still waiting on the pancakes. Manager never even stopped by and he was there walking around."}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast, as I had a free pancake offer that we were going to use for dessert. They said it was takeout only, and I mentioned they're standing to lose $40 in sales, but the GM said takeout only.  So, we ordered drinks and closed out, and I decided might as well order the pancakes, which took 30-minutes. It would've been fine, but they wouldn't refill our drinks. I mentioned to the GM and our drinks were refilled; my buddy's coffee half full, LOL.  We made the best of it and enjoyed ourselves. The Dulce de leches pancakes were quite good. At the end, we chalked it up as to why we never go to Denny's, and valued how much better Black Bear and other diners are... when it comes to service. As that's all we really experienced."}
{"text":"We were so excited that we finally got a Denny's here.  Today, September 4, 2017, was the first opportunity we had to visit and it was one of the worst breakfast experiences I have had anywhere.  Once we were seated the waitress came to take our drink order.  It wasn't too long until we got our drinks, sort of.  We got empty coffee cups because there was no coffee ready and got regular tea instead of the sweet tea asked for.  The waitress took our orders in a fairly timely manner but then we waited, and waited, and waited for nearly an hour before our meal was served.  The waitress apologized but the wait was ridiculous.  At one point all of the waitresses were just standing at the kitchen talking.  I saw at least a couple of patrons get up and leave because of the wait.  We couldn't leave because we had a couple of little children who were very hungry!!! When we finally got our food it was warm, but certainly not hot.  And my toast wasn't toasted.  I was planning to bring another group on Thursday, September 7 but have changed plans."}
{"text":"I came on a Thursday afternoon, around 3PM in between lunch and dinner rush. It was still very busy, and the service was very slow. We only had to wait a few minutes for a table, but after we were seated our waitress didn't come by for at least 10 minutes, not even for a drink order! After ordering we waited at least 30 minutes for our food. The food was okay of course, all Dennys food tastes the same to me. The whole place was so crowded and the walkways in between tables seemed so narrow, you have to wait for people to pass by before you can walk down an aisle. I might come here again if I know it's not going to be so busy, just because it's a cheap place to eat on the strip 24 hours a day."}
{"text":"I am a frequent middle of the night diner so I decided to try this location. Only person there for almost an hour and I had to ask twice to have my coffee refilled and had to ask twice for ice water. Food was quick and tasty, but service was lacking. Eventually the waitress just disappeared around the corner to \"roll silverware\" and read her magazine. Don't waste your time at this location."}
{"text":"Long drive to make it to sin city. Just like my car we were running on empty in deed, needing much fuel. We never eat Dennys at home so bleh you in sin city why not it right next to the hotel lobby. We eat come out to 24 leave 5 tip say 30, round it off. It wasn't that bad al everything was cooked great nothing burnt nothing over or under Seasoned ! Very happy traveler. Last time I came her they had the. Servers cooked there own tables food crazy. They come a long way. Morning around 10 am Saturday morning was packed but everything can out great for got who took care of us. Would definitely go back even thought I don't eat that in California. Clean tables clean  utensils. Floor bathrooms as well keep it morning staff of last Saturday August 5!!"}
{"text":"This Denny's is not like any Denny's especially where it is located.The place,the floors are immaculate, the server Jennifer is the best ever,polite,courteous, & there always waiting on You. The other staff is great & friendly. Food on time, they sing Happy Birthday if you need it.Manager Herb is great"}
{"text":"Dirty place, smokers all over the place, servers are not clean.  Water is bad & has things floating in It.  Bad service.  Food over cooked, especially chicken. Breakfast & other items are not cooked well. they do not wear gloves. Place is hot & air not good. Friends I know will not go back.  If you are unhappy with review, Too bad, it is the truth, Correct the problems."}
{"text":"Awful, food is never cooked right, the place & floors are always dirty, & so are their tables, and you never know you may be lucky & get hair in your food. Gross"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning .... it lasted a week.! The manager wasn't there so they were doing all sorts of wrong things apparently"}
{"text":"There is really no justification for coming to eat at Denny's, other than being open 24 hours. Come late enough and you can put up with obnoxiously drunk boors shouting at each other; early enough and you can put up with screaming fat children running amok; rest of the time you can put up with creepers at the \"bar\" sipping on coffee and giving you the shifty eye; and through all that, you can get a combination of the bad and the worse, all for wildly inflated prices with mediocre service, and a case of the runs to boot.  I have learned from Angelo's experience - when they serve you a raw chicken burger, and they recompense you with a free sundae, you are at the lowest of the low. AVOID."}
{"text":"No one goes to Denny's because their excited about it (well most people). Most times I've ever been at a Denny's was because it was 2am and it was the only thing open. My latest venture here was more around midnight and me and my friends were super hungry. The place was pretty empty so we figured the service would be amaze balls. We sat and we sat and we sat some more and eventually our food came. It was obvious that our food sat and it sat and it sat in the back forever. We ate the food and when it came time to pay, I realized I probably should have just skipped Denny's. Apparently every night their cash registers reboot themselves and it did so after the manager slid my friend's card. The manager said it's okay we had to wait about five minutes and he'd swipe it again because he was sure the transaction didn't go through. As someone who worked in customer service for five years, the manager handled the situation completely wrong. A back and forth ensued between the manager and my cousin and he got upset because we got impatient with his nightly cashier woes. The people that sat next to us lost their patience completely and got up and left as their food service takes forever. I'd probably stay away from this place like the plague and next time I'll just go home."}
{"text":"Good food good service. The prices are ok.went for breakfast and would of liked a few more healthy choices"}
{"text":"It Denny's what do you expect.  Not much but you can't really screw up bacon and eggs I thought.  Had to go there for Father's Day breakfast because that is what dad wanted.  It took 2 1/2 hours to get our 5 breakfast meals.  The poor waiter was awesome and extremely apologetic.  I felt bad for him, not his fault but sure people took it out on his tips.  He told us that no one showed up for the kitchen crew and really short staffed.  Also said they had a large party of 30+ people that they forgot about and didn't staff accordingly and put the restaurant in a tail spin trying to keep up.  Not one time did the manager come by a table, whoever it was never came out on the floor once.  Terrible management, poor employees, and the got that helped us was top notch.  He should go to a decent restaurant and would do much better.  On top of that, some guy took his nasty feet out and was barefoot in the restaurant.....disgusting."}
{"text":"Friendly staff...good food...good prices, comparable to IHOP...will visit again if in the area, but would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Late night munching while we were waiting to go to the airport. Hardly anyone was there. So there was good service and the food was quick. Decent food overall. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"No one does fries better. Ask them to do the wavy cut fries well done. The service is good here. Nice clean place"}
{"text":"What a piece of a$$ pie hole place. Sat there for 20 mins and no one helped us . Terrible place to eat or to get service at. If I were the manager of this place, I would be ashamed of the service that my employees are providing. Hearing a waitress comments to a table that she's servicing was very unprofessional. All I can say that there was a very nice young man that helped us with drinks in the beginning ....-after that straight down hill of poop.  Wish I could give this a Noooo Star !!!! Attention YELP ! You need a new update."}
{"text":"I've been to this Denny's more than once, but it's never more than a 2 star place.   The most recent time, there was only one server, and about 6 tables to serve with large groups. It took us 20 minutes to get us drinks. Now I am not blaming the server because I know how harsh that is, and you can tell the server had an attitude because of the shortage of help.   This corporation makes enough money to employ more workers. Denny's should be ashamed and If I was that waiter I would have walked out, because that is too much strain for one person!  Only reason Denny's is a good choice is because the prices of food is good."}
{"text":"We had to wait just a few minutes to be seated BUT they did acknowledge us and said they'd be right with us. That's what counts! Food is good and we didn't have to wait long. The food is typical Denny's food but good. It's not gourmet. You want gourmet food go to Carrabbas. Service was good considering she seemed to be the only server. She was friendly and pleasant and made sure we had every thing.  Music is good, excellent volume! You can hear it but still talk and hear each other. Love the old time diner look. My only complaint is the one side is freezing. We had to move to the other side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I think everybody has been to a Denny's before so I'm not really reviewing the food which is standardized across their entire restaurant chain.  What I am giving four stars to is how accommodating, friendly, welcoming, and efficient the staff and manager are.  I came here twice during my stay in Independance and each time I was treated very very well.  The manager and all the wait staff are just so nice and polite.  The first time I came here was late at night since nothing else was open.  After I saw how clean it was and nice the staff were, I wasn't afraid to come back two days later and sit and have coffee.  I must say the coffee was pretty good.  Super hot like the way I like it, and I had to refuse refills once I got up to my limit of three.   It's clean.  It's friendly.  I would come here again and would recommend it as the best Denny's I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service and well prepared, good food needs to be recognized and rewarded regardless of the venue. I am at Denny's in Tempe Arizona. Being the distinguished Elite Yelper that I am, I was going to go out in search of a funky, cool local place to dine but I was so damn tired of traveling that I decided on the Denny's in the parking lot adjacent to my hotel. I was pleasantly surprised!  I went old school diner dinner. A Double Cheeseburger, fries and an old fashioned chocolate shake. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM!  Fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked and fast, friendly service.   The fact that a \"Tupperware Princess\" giving a presentation of the latest and greatest food containers did not deter me from sitting at the counter enjoying a great classic diner meal.  Good job Denny's!"}
{"text":"Stopped in around 10 p.m. to grab a bite. When I walked in it looked like the place had been hit by a hurricane! Food, napkins whatever all over the floor. The waitress was swamped and managed to tell me that it would be a few minutes in a not very friendly attitude. After approximately 10 minutes she took my order for a caesar salad. I mistakenly thought that would be fast. After 15 more minutes and no waitress Insight I got up and left. Terrible terrible service!"}
{"text":"the denny's was surprisingly open on christmas day, the wait took under 10 minutes which was wonderful. How ever the food portions for the \"seniors\" was super disappointing. It was honestly a joke and a shared a good laughter with our group. However the server was definitely unprofessional, she kept apologizing for her service which made it worse. She was kind of a ghost, but overall do not recommend the denny's here at all. The food isn't worth the money. Kinda a bum, merry christmas to us.   Side note, the pancakes were good."}
{"text":"Denny's has always been my go to place for quick and cheap eats. But I never walk through the door expecting to be blown away by the food or the service.  As far as diners go, Denny's has long been the American gold standard for cheap and cheerful. We only have a few here, but they are always busy when I go.  Can't really fault it, as long as you are realistic in your expectations. The menu is huge, and I try to get something different every time. They have creative specials that keep things interesting.  My only suggestion would be to skip the hashbrowns. They are always limp and undercooked, even when I ask for them well done. Unless that's your kind of thing."}
{"text":"Hahaha, we walked into this joint like at 3 in the morning. I walked in with my Mai tai and the host was like, you can't come in here with that. I told him it was cranberry juice but he looked at me like I was nuts because the mai tai was orange. I went outside,  pounded my drink and went back inside."}
{"text":"I was in town and came for breakfast before heading back home, but had terrible service. First, out server takes a long time although it wasn't so busy. He also messed up both our orders and when we notified him he took 10 minutes to bring back our new eggs and fries so our food got cold.  It wasn't until the manager noticed we were waiting for so long. They forgot our condiments after we asked, our refills, and there was no customer service. I wouldn't recommend this Denny's unless you have nothing but time and patience... or you like cold food."}
{"text":"Service was so slow- actually nonexistent! Had to show menu to server to get everything that was supposed to come with my meal.  Place was empty- but Took an hour for greasy egg whites and lukewarm coffee??  Seriously??"}
{"text":"Great Nachos really big!! My favourites!! The only bad thing was about a man who was rude because there were no body there so we went in, so he was angry. And then he doesn't let us to sit in the place we wanted even thought the restaurant was empty. Luckily our waiter was amaizing!!"}
{"text":"Anyone who has critical remarks to make, please tell me where in the GTA you can get *T-bone Steak* & Eggs & REAL Hash Browns for only $19.99 AND substitute a pancake for the toast AT NO EXTRA CHARGE! And for a small extra charge, have saut√©ed mushrooms and/or onions on that medium rare T-bone? Or how many places offer scrumptious honey jalape√±o bacon with your brekkie? Or offer vanilla or hazelnut Coffee-Mate creamers, 3 kinds of sweeteners, Sweet N Low, Splenda or Equal, with your bottomless, choice of Mild or Bold, coffee? First time ever I have happily gulped down 3 cups of MILD coffee with a meal! Find me a diner elsewhere in the GTA that offers all of the above, I challenge you! If not, I give you: @DennysCanada!  My daughter and hubby ordered their scrambled eggs with melted grated cheese, not available in most diners either. Hubby raved over the honey jalape√±o bacon & shared a couple of pieces with me. Other daughter had a build your own grand slam breakfast that allowed her to avoid eggs, to which she's allergic, but enjoy the pancakes, which doesn't bother her, turkey bacon, hash browns & English muffin, nicely buttery & not overtoasted (unlike McDonald's, which burns all English muffins!). She raved that no other diners allow her to order a big breakfast without the eggs!  Don't forget, this is a place offering 24 hour breakfast! None of this we're done at 10:30 am nonsense!  Service was very good, fast, lots of coffee & creamer refills, and waitresses all smiling and cheerful throughout. Now look at the photo of my wonderful Thanksgiving breakfast! I rest my case, Toronto Yelpers!   2nd visit, March 25, 2017: I tried to upgrade a lumberjack slam breakfast to perfection this time and nearly succeeded. Want cheese on your scrambled eggs? Yes! Jalape√±o Honey Bacon strips? Great! Blueberries on your pancakes? Yes! Onion snd cheese on your hash browns? Sounds good! Sourdough bread for toast? Sure why not? Hazelnut creamers with mild blend coffee? I love it that way!  So it's still 5 star service and food variety choices, but I've decided I won't order the American style shredded hash browns next time. Trouble is that the little pieces keep falling off my fork. It's not like the formed hash brown patties at McDonald's or the tiny coins at Burger King, nor is it like what they call \"breakfast potatoes.\" Those I can gobble up but the shredded hash browns were stone cold by the time I scooped them all up. Admittedly that's my fault, not Denny's.   Next time I'll substitute tater tots, they sound yummy and won't slip off my clumsy fork either!"}
{"text":"this is my second time that I make an order online and it is never ready by the time they said it will be ready, they just waist my time poor service"}
{"text":"Don't go late night ...ugh Food was absolutely horrible. Sad thing is our service was incredible. The waiter belongs at a much nicer restaurant."}
{"text":"We made a late night pickup order and were told it would be an hour wait as they were busy. No problem since we were at work and good food is worth the wait. I got there early to pick it up and waited while they made the milkshake my coworker had ordered. When I got back less than five minutes after being given out order, we sat down to enjoy our meals. They were ice cold! All of it! I called and talked to someone over there and they said sorry and offered to microwave it for us if we brought it back. Seriously?! I can microwave it! French fries turn disgusting when microwaved! Even more disgusting than eating ice cold fries! We had hoped that this would be our new go to for late night, work night meals. NOPE! Complete ball drop Denny's! I'm giving you two stars because even cold the pot roast melt sandwich wasn't terrible. You've just lost 3 to 5 nights a week of my workplace ordering from you. After all, I can get cold food and poor service elsewhere for way cheaper."}
{"text":"I placed an order over the phone (a waffle slam), went to pick it up, drove all the way home to find NO syrup in the bag. Of all things! It wouldn't have been an issue if I had syrup at home, but I don't so I was beyond frustrated that I had to drive all the way back to Denny's for syrup.  When I got there I told them I would like an entirely new meal because by that time it was cold and waffles get soggy pretty quickly. They happily obliged. However, when they made my new order there was syrup, but no Pico de Gallo that I asked for.   This is the second time they messed up my order. The first time I ordered a side of potatoes and never got them.  Incompetence at it's best. Trivial things, but really, how hard can it be to work at Denny's? I gave 2 stars because the food overall was good.  Rule of Thumb: ALWAYS check your orders!!"}
{"text":"Oh man, do I have memories of this Denny's, which was a regular stop for my family in the low 1980's. I must have eaten here 100 times during my early childhood between trips to and from Century III Mall. I loved it then, but I barely tolerate it now. However...  The Salted Caramel Bacon Brownie Sundae that is currently being offered as part of their pork-centric Baconalia (sounds perverted, don't it?) promotion. The brownie is bakery-quality, warm, and butter-smooth, and becomes almost magical when topped with the brackish caramel and bacon bits, not to mention the vanilla ice cream.   You'd never think Denny's would sell something like this, eh?   Conversely, the Bacon Cheeseburger, something I had no business ordering, was an overcooked, crumbly, flavorless debacle.  But the service was very good.   And that's about all the musing Denny's deserves."}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House on the hill above was impossible to get into, so we opted for breakfast at a Denny's I haven't visited in 18 years.  I wonder if they're all going for the 50's motif. Such was the decor. The food? Eh, I decided not to fall for their \"Let's Get Cheesy\" promotion and went with the Bacon Avocado Burrito, which should have been heaven considering the ingredients. Instead, it was just a step up from something Burger King would offer, the avocado being the only component with detectable flavor. A pile of lifeless hash browns accompanied it.   Dessert, however, saved Sunday. Denny's has invented something called Pancake Puppies, balls of dough that come off as strawberry-and-white-chocolate-filled funnel cakes or sugary hush puppies with a cream cheese icing. Denny's goes even one step further, making them into a sundae with whipped cream, turning it into the Strawberry Shortcake of your dreams. And oh how the puppies go famously well with ice cream.   Kay and I shared, and she liked it so much, she pulled the plate away from me several times in a sugar-induced fever.   Our server Darlene (a name for a waitress if there ever was such a thing) was fine.   P.S. Denny's new Fusion Favorites look and taste like girly drinks or household chemicals depending on your point 'o view. Choosing to be secure in my masculinity, I ordered the Pacific Chiller, which has \"flavorings\" of coconut, lime, banana, and orange spikin' the Sprite. Anti-freeze never tasted so sweet. I kid. It wasn't bad and was a change of pace from Pepsi, but you won't catch me drinking something that resembles this at the local no-name bar, if you ever find me in one. Chances are, you won't."}
{"text":"Betcha didn't know there was another Denny's lurking within the vicinity of the recently sold Century III Mall? Well, here it is.  Many years ago, I had what was one of the very worst dining experiences of my life at this location, but luckily, last weekend, our supper was more benign.   The service was on-point and friendly. The hostess doted on us as if we were family.   And the eggy, cheesy, meaty, moist Grand Slamwich ain't a bad proposition, particularly when toasted, buttery potato bread shores up the entire thing.   A hot fudge sundae with Oreo chunks finished my breakfast-for-dinner in a mildly appetizing manner.   What I could have done without: Haplessly unseasoned hash browns with nary a crunch to 'em.   It's Denny's, and there are many..."}
{"text":"Cheapest breakfast on this end of the strip considering most the hotels at this end are way overpriced for very cheap food. Go to Dennys and save your money for other fun. Service was SLOW, but I expected that because of other reviews on here. Over an hour to get our food even though the restaurant was half empty."}
{"text":"With a franchise like Denny's I usually expect two things: Reasonably decent fare and reasonably cheap prices. I didn't get either during my visit earlier today. The biscuits were obviously several hours old, the sausage unimpressive, and the hash browns not quite crispy.  Far worse however was the service. I asked for gravy on my biscuits and was cheerfully told she'd bring some out. The waitress then asked if my friend would like ranch with her fries and brought everything out reasonable time. At the end of the meal we saw an extra .50 cent charge for ranch and $1.79 for gravy, which the waitress had neither informed us about, nor did anything about beyond mumbling an \"I'm sorry.\"   I would not eat here again as there are far better options nearby."}
{"text":"My wife and kids stopped by tonight at 7 p.m. We were all hungry after finishing some Christmas shopping.  The place wasn't very busy at all.  Got seated right away.  A great start.  That's were it ended.  No one came to take our order or acknowledge us.  We waited for 12 minutes then left.  Another customer nearby told me, \"I don't blame you.\"  The guy who seated us smiled at us on our way out.  I just told him, \"We sat there over ten minutes and we got no service.\"  His response on our way out the door, \"For real?!?\""}
{"text":"This place is so great for nacho's and of course their cinnamon pancakes are amazing! Their nacho's are very filling! The staff is so welcoming. Will definitely come back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Dirty floors and questionable service. Food cooked in bad oil and grease. This place should be held to some chain standard, but is not. Where are the District and Regional managers?"}
{"text":"Horrible service, came in March 19, 2017 at around 1:00 pm we had a male waiter. He took our order and our food came cold and he forgot our coffee also he wasn't even the one to bring our food to us another waitress had to she was taking on the whole room serving very quickly and even serving and taking orders for the male waiter after taking our order he seem to have disappeared never coming back....just awful"}
{"text":"This location has been renovated from when I was last here. It's larger, brightly lit and holds an ample amount of patrons. our wait for 2 qas quoted at 10 min, but was more like 5. I settled on the Grand Slam Slugger eggs scrambled with cheese, all bacon crispy, pancakes and hash browns. My order came out exactly like that! Given this place was packed, I was pleasantly surprised at how fast our order came out. This particular Slam also comes with choice of Juice or Coffee, but she let get Tea in place of juice. Our server, Sherri, was great! Friendly and upbeat. For a reasonably priced breakfast in Vegas, head on over here."}
{"text":"Our greeter didn't even say hello.  He was not even acknowledging our presence until I said hello.  He was not even doing anything just standing there, lol.  I said, hello he goes how many?  I said 5 he takes 5 menus with him n starts walking without saying anything I'm like, should we follow u?  We have a young child w us no kids menu was presented or nothing was asked.  Very weird.  Our waiter was awesome though.  My eggs was suppose to b egg whites n they messed it up but quickly remade item.  Completely forgot my husbands drink.  My husband mentioned this at the end he immediacy offered to give it to him to go which was very sweet.  The server don't remember his name but it just seemed like he was a bit off but overall he was really good."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst service I have received from a restaurant and it's management. My friend and I decided to go here for breakfast it was about 4 am. and not too busy with only 4 other tables being served. 2 of which have already eaten and are mainly just socializing. Vicky our waitress was definitely the most incompetent waitress I have ever encountered. When our food arrived mine wasn't even hot like it had been sitting there waiting for a while. The coffee Cream had gone bad clearly because it was floating on top. After showing the waitress and manager the bad food which was served I was met with rudeness and hostility over what the manager claims was no big deal. He then told me after our discussion the only thing I want from you is for you to pay your bill and get out instead of resolving the issue like I was in the wrong for pointing out his mistakes,,,smh,  I will definitely not be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"It's ironic that our coffee mug was only filled once, when originally brought to us. Server brought food and then placed check on table. Walked all around us, but never offered to refill coffee. Pet peeve of mine...their mugs read \"At a diner, a cup of coffee is never half empty\"...no, it's just empty!  **Side note...I mentioned to the cashier that we did not receive attentive service. I got a coffee to go and $5 off our bill. Very nice gesture."}
{"text":"Consistent food, love the omelettes and slams that were available! A bit pricey but I love the taste! I can come here everyday!"}
{"text":"The waitresses were awesome, they were all running their butts off and getting to everyone as best they could. I ordered breakfast and my eggs were a bit runny so they quickly replaced them! We sat at the counter which was unfortunate for the male manager on duty, as we could see him rudely snap at one of the waitresses for asking for something from one of the cooks. Otherwise, good experience, great job to the servers!"}
{"text":"The service was great, manager was really nice and it was the cleanest Denny's in a mile!"}
{"text":"If you are considering visiting this restaurant, I urge you to reconsider. The customer service was abysmal.  5 minutes before we were greeted at the host stand.  Another 5 minutes before we sat.  15 minutes until anyone came to the table to take our drink order, so we went ahead and placed our order in hopes of speeding up the process. 45 minutes later our food started coming out 1 dish at a time.  There was a 15 minute difference between the first and last dish.  How is that acceptable anywhere?  The staff seemed genuinely surprised when we expressed our frustration.   Meanwhile there were over 10 staff visible in the kitchen area that were standing around, socializing and moving at a pace that indicated they were in no hurry.  Run, don't walk to any other restaurant you can find."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The waiting for a table  took so long even when there was plenty of tables available. The waiter was so slow that we didn't get our drinks until the food was ready. He didn't offer refills on our coffees?. Some food was burn, other was cold. Really bad experience."}
{"text":"Today we had Ricardo for our server and he was excellent! He listened to our 5yr. Old granddaughter and looked at her while she was ordering. I love that.  The food we great hot and the order was perfect.  We loved the chocolate chip pancakes and they were great! :)"}
{"text":"The service was ok but I did not get what I ordered and what i did get was greasy.  They also advertise blueberry pancakes with strawberries and bananas but they have no bananas!! The TV was on closed caption only in Spanish!! We will not come here again."}
{"text":"Was happy when this Denny's opened close to our home. We have been frequent customers of various Denny's restaurants over the years. This location has the worst customer service by far. Even when the restaurant is practically empty of customers, they are still slow to seat and serve you. This last visit was the final straw. Only one other family was in the restaurant when we were seated and they had already been served. We were seated, but after 10 or more minutes, nobody came back to take our drink order or food order. 10 minutes is a long time when the employees on duty are all standing at the counter talking with each other, and have no other customers. We left and went to another Denny's farther from our home and it was much better. Disappointed that we will no longer be going to the Denny's closest to our home."}
{"text":"This is my third visit in two days. I have experienced 2 bad breakfasts and 1 good late night sandwich .  Today's ultimate skillet was lacking spinach ,mushrooms , and the cheese . It was overloaded with potatoes and over cooked onions. My 1st cup off coffee was ice cold. Service was VERY slow."}
{"text":"Our server, was very pleasant.  The tables and restrooms clean. I liked the set up of the tables.  It made me feel not so crowded in.  This is a very nice Dennys until we got to the food!! My husband's soup was cold- seriously not an exaggeration.  My eggs were barely warm and mostly raw and my toast had not one speck of butter.  We got up and left."}
{"text":"This location has terrible service- super slow and the staff is very abrupt and rude. Plus its super annoying that they *NEVER* have to-go containers. Don't plan on taking leftovers home or ordering anything for pick up.  The cleanliness is also an issue for me- bathrooms are gross and I've never once gotten a table that wasn't sticky.  I don't consider myself a food snob- usually I love Denny's. This location is just awful though."}
{"text":"Ordered my food n black waitress forgot everything I asked for, never going back, n we had to ask for more coffee n our cup, n ask for utensils. Only tip I can gv them, is learn how to serve ur customers"}
{"text":"It's Denny's. can't go wrong with this place after a Late night of fun at 2am. The server was more than helpful in assisting my wasted husband and friends. Good location."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a long time. Now I remember why. The customer service stinks!with a table of seven, everybody complained. My pancakes tasted like fish. Cappuccino is pure milk. Fries were cold. We couldn't get enough hot coffee....  I swear I'm going to open up my own coffee truck!!!! Arrrrggh"}
{"text":"This place is so far the best place to eat if you live in Ohio and every other place closes at 10pm. The food is pretty good and the service has not yet disappoint me . Would recommend this place for those who like to eat after 10pm."}
{"text":"Just walked out myself. Only 1 table full in the whole restaurant and they still couldn't take our order. Lady who sat us down didn't smile once and was counting money when we walked in. Waited 20 minutes with our waters and walked out. The lady was still counting the money when we left."}
{"text":"I swear every time I come to this Denny's it's something! I'm not one to complain considering my fianc√© is a waiter. I've been here 4 times 2 times the food was HORRIBLE like I couldn't even finish it bad. This last time we asked multiple times for sauces... never got them. They weren't busy yet we never got refills. A table walked out on our waitress and she screamed and cussed in the back along with her co workers in the back. I'd say this place is under some extremely poor management"}
{"text":"I was really concerned that Canadian Denny's was going to be as disappointing as Target was when it came to Canada. I was pleasantly surprised that the experience very closely resembled Denny's in the US.   Our server, Roxann, was amazing, the portions were very generous and the food was served hot.  All in all, we had a very positive experience.  I found the qualify of the food and portions to be a much better value than the Sunset chain of restaurants of which I am not a big fan."}
{"text":"Hmmmm....  Maybe not so good. There is a reason why I stopped eating a Denny's when I quit drinking 24 years ago. The food was bland and overcooked. The service was lacking and does no one ever answer the phone?  If this place wasn't the only place for a mile and next to the Marriott, I would not have gone."}
{"text":"Loved the service and food !!! Everything was done freshly in a good amount of time! Our server was Kim , she was great and on it !"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. DONT WASTE UR TRIP HERE. At least my experience was. I was craving Denny's, and the wait was LONGER than I was told because \" kitchen was backed up\". We got skipped as well. The manager sat us in a rush, very unprofessional he seemed frustrated. He's given that position to deal with situations like these, right? My server was good ! A young man named Cheston? I believe. Our food was GROSS as well . My food was over cooked and I had SOGGY stale fries. My food was also something I didn't ask for. Very disappointed. What happens in Vegas stays but not my experience , I'm taking this to Yelp !!!!!"}
{"text":"SO GROSS. DO NOT COME TO THIS. The wait took forever.  We even got skipped !! The manager sat us down in a rush with attitude (male). Our food was gross , cold / soggy fries , I asked for my food a certain way and got it differently. Our server was good, young male name Chester. I am never going there , maybe everyone is too drink to realize but if you're sober DO NOT GO"}
{"text":"Took 40 MINUTES to get our food.  I would have cooked it faster at home, had the dishes cleaned and be passed out before Denny's could get their food out.  Or maybe it's because 30 minutes after the order was rung in, the cook walks in with a Gatorade in his hand like he's cruised over to the store and hung out, decided what flavor Gatorade he wanted then came back to do what he's paid to do.  If I could ZERO stars."}
{"text":"First time here. Not impressed. The place isn't even halfway full but it still took while a to get our food. Our waiter was rushing and not actively listening. For example: I asked for butter for my sons pancakes and a saucer to put the extra food on seeing as his plate was over flowing. He brought back the butter only. I then reminded him of the saucer and he returned with a bowl. I said sir, I simply need a small saucer for his extra pancakes. He returned with a plate. (A total of 3 failed attempts, all for a saucer.) And to top it off I ordered a skillet and apparently the chef forgot to put meat in it. Ow and the wifi sucks, it's terribly slow. I would give one star but at least the waiter was kind with his incompetence. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food didn't come for 40 minutes and the place was nearly empty (it was 11 at night when I was there)."}
{"text":"It was slow to get seated, but they have alcohol and the service was good one we were at a table. And the food was good ole standard dennys. The place was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast place in Vegas.  There is always a line, but they move you in fast.  It's clean and cheap, so we can save our money for video poker or a really great dinner.  What more can you ask for from Denny's?"}
{"text":"I do not recommend using the online order and pickup service.  Used this service today and was informed online the food would be ready in 20 min.  When we showed up, 10 minutes past the time the food was due, out food was not ready.  The waitress/hostess gave us a bag of food which she insisted was our complete order.  It was easy to see that when you order 5 meals, and there are 3 containers in a bag, the order was not complete.  After giving some attitude, she pulled out the receipt and I showed her the order was incomplete.  The manager, who identified himself as Marvin was full of excuses.  He said the computer doesn't take into account they are busy, there is no guarantee the food would be ready, it's veteran's day and they had to give free meals to those who served (BTW they weren't that busy and I'm a 21 year Navy Vet who is paying full price). We left with out completed order 40 min past the time it was supposed to be ready...got home and there was no syrup, butter or ranch.  DON'T ORDER ONLINE FROM THIS LOCATION.  Excuses not results."}
{"text":"Omg I wanna give 0 stars!!  Walk in and it smells so bad and I ask the lady that's seating us why does it smell so bad in here? She says I don't know...and keeps waking then we sit down to eat and they bring me my food and it looks so gross it's cold and looks very old so I ask them To re make it and it gets sent out looking a little better but def not worth the 50 dollars we Spent here and the cooks obviously take NO pride what so ever in there food or presentation of there plates food!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today. They were having a cheerleading fundraiser for a local high school. We waited 40 minutes for our food. My lemonade was not refilled the entire time. Food is set down. Right away I can tell my wife's avacado on her salad had been sitting out for quite some time. It is browned. Everything on my plate, a regular slam, is cold. I left, no charge. Upset enough to drive to ihop 6 miles away. 2 out of 10, would not eat here again. To be fair I believe it was the waitress' fault and not the kitchen."}
{"text":"This morning I phoned in an order to this Denny's.  With my order, I asked for eggs, over medium.  I received eggs over hard...EXTRA HARD when you expect runny yolk!  Unfortunately this isn't the first time it has happened.  The first time, I took pictures of it and took them with me when I returned for the next day, as I have been frequenting this location for years.  I showed the manager and he agreed that no parts of those eggs were medium.  He then walked away to deal with whatever he was doing before I interrupted him with my dissatisfaction.  Rude.  I took my order and left.  The staff I have dealt with outside of management, whenever visiting this location have been great.  However, management is unacceptable.  Today when I placed my order, the young lady on the phone who took the order was kind.  When I picked up the order, still good.  Once I got home and opened my container, I discovered that my eggs were overcooked.  I called to make them aware of the situation and was passed over to the manager.  When I explained to him my dilemma, he told me he would recook the eggs.  I asked if I can just have the whole meal recooked and was told that \"I'm not going to recook your whole meal because your eggs were a little over cooked!\"  I explained to him that it is wrong to only redo part of it, as the rest of the meal will be differently tempered with only new eggs.  I further explained that I would find me a different Denny's and post an online review.  I am keeping to my word.  Some advice, don't lose a frequent customer over hash browns and a biscuit.  Mr. Manager, you act like I was asking for steak and lobster.  Now, I won't be asking this location for anything!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The waitress was polite as was the girl that sat us, however, the service was very slow. We were a group of 5 & there were only 2 maybe 3 other tables when we arrived. It took a few minutes to be given a table, several minutes to give our order & even longer to receive our food.  We waited at least 5 minutes for someone to come to the front so we could pay. Finally when we were ready to reconcile the bill, the manager came, asked how I was, I replied I was fine, I asked him how he was & his reply was, I quote, \"I'm rushed\". Now I am not a manager of a restaurant but I'm pretty sure that is one of the first-don't do this-in restaurants 101.  We will not come back to this location.  Again, the food was good & the waitress was nice so that is why our visit received 2 stars."}
{"text":"I love the food at Denny's and I typically go to the location at Scottsdale Pavilions off of Indian Bend and Pima. Today my friend and I decided to try the McDowell restaurant which was a terrible idea. We walked in and we're greeted a few minutes later by the manager who stared at us for those few minutes before walking over. We were seated at a booth - per our request - but waited for 10 minutes before our server walked over. Since it had taken so long we ordered our entire meal when she finally came by. The restaurant was not busy but the majority of the open tables were dirty with food and plates all over, food and trash on the ground... It took another 7 or 8 minutes for our drinks come out (water and coke) and about the same after that for our milkshakes which were dropped off and completely melted like they had been sitting for a while. At this point we were super irritated so my friend told our server that we didn't want the milkshakes anymore because they were melted. The server took one away - without any apology or offer to make a new one - but left the other and just disappeared. Seriously, just disappeared again for more than 5 minutes. When she came back my friend told her to take the remaining shake and asked to speak to the manager. The same manager who sat us finally walked (very slowly) towards our table another 5 minutes later. She looked disheveled, irritated, and unprofessional with a stained and wrinkled shirt. When she got to our table she said, \"You wanted to talk to me?\" My friend said that we were leaving, didn't want our food (which still hadn't been dropped off), and wouldn't be paying (for the water and coke). The manager didn't even try and fix the situation or apologize - she heard what my friend said and immediately turned around and started walking away and muttered, \"Have a good day.\"  I'm so disappointed and irritated. I will NEVER go back to this location again and it actually makes me reconsider all Denny's restaurants. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"We went to this  Denny's for breakfast this morning, stood there for almost 5 minutes and still wasn't recognized by the host or whoever was supposed to seat us.  We left"}
{"text":"When hungry and it's late, we usually come here to this location since it's the nearest.    Denny's is Denny's nothing spectacular about it, and nothing special about this location either.  Like all Denny's I been to, the place was clean, with good lighting, the service was good with excellent customer service.  The food was good for its price, and the portions are good too.  Nothing to complain about and nothing to praise about either.   Overall a good Denny's and will probably be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Weekly customers with our kids usually on Sundays but we may have to stop coming they are constantly out if ingredients from bananas, to spaghetti for kids, to a chocolate shake this evening.  Very disappointed feel bad there is always only one waitress looking overwhelmed serving everybody in the place wow what is going on?!?"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! Our server was ok however some other girl LAKEISHA came to our table , while we're were eating and wanted a chair. We told her we were using it (for our 2 purses and diaper bag) and she responded with WELL WE HAVE PEOPLE WAITING TO BE SEATED AND I NEED THIS CHAIR. So we have her one. She ended up taking 2 total. The end result was that they didn't need it at all and just put the by the window facing the outside. I personally think she did that just mock us. Brian was GREAT!!! He took care of us and FINALLY got our pancakes. If it wasn't for him we would probably be waiting for them still THANKS BRIAN!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Denny's in years but was craving breakfast foods so bad I had to go.  I was impressed with Sean who seemed to be doing literally everything except cooking.   It wasn't crazy busy but busy enough and he was ion top of it.    Cheap dinner for two people and the food was good with huge portions.  He kept drinks full and whisked away our empty plates.    The bathroom was clean and stocked. Restaurant appeared clean.   Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Service is okay, they barely pass by which was kinda annoying. Denny's food is always good and hits the spot at those unusual times."}
{"text":"This ain't you corner Denny's in rural America! But let me say - once we were seated, the service was superb!! The service deserved 5 stars, but what I have an issue with is this: IT'S A BREAKFAST DINER. PEOPLE WILL ORDER PANCAKES AND FRENCH TOAST. WHY THE @#%* SCRIMP ON THE SYRUP??? Honestly, I didn't go there for a gourmet meal, as all we needed was a bite to eat before hitting the road and escaping with some of the money we came with. Yeah, it's crowed, it's noisy, and you won't see any of the people from the TV show Vegas, but it's Americana. The meal was fine, but the management/owner decided to cut corners and serve a syrup that equated to brown water. REALLY??!!  I'll bump it to 3 stars if they ever improve the syrup, otherwise McDonald's is just up the street."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to this Denny's at least once a week if only for the show. Some times the service isn't the greatest and that could possibly be cause they don't schedule enough people to work. Most of the time these gals are spread too thin so that could be the reason.   Every waitress that I have had has been so much fun to watch in action and chit chat with when they aren't busy. We usually sit at the bar because that way you aren't forgotten but that is at most diners.  Keep Smiling Gals =)"}
{"text":"Good service and the food is always fresh and served fast. They have a good size banquet room and they have plenty of parking. I eat here for dinner on a weekly basis and consistently get good food and service. They also offer WiFi (so-so)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning around 7:30am and there was a table or two dining. Service was welcoming, quick, and attentive. Coffee was okay and you get free refills. I got the All-American Slam. The bacon was crispy and the eggs were scrambled well. Their hash brown wasn't crispy enough, or maybe this is just how it is with this style of hashbrown - can't say I am a fan of it, I much prefer Eggspectation potatos or Mcdonald's hashbrowns. My friend said her omelette was delicious and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I show up, it's 3am and I just got off work, I wait to be given a menu and no one shows up. I have to grab a menu myself to place an order. I'm ordering my to go food and the server is rushing me. I get to the part that I am going to order my smoothie and the server said \"I won't make you a smoothie because I have food piling up and a lot of people who need things from me\". I asked him to repeat what he said because I'm thinking maybe he can't make me a smoothie. But he repeated \"I won't make you a smoothie\". To this I become upset because he could have lied and said, hey you know what my machine is down or whatever and I would have been fine. But the fact that he said he won't just pissed me off. That's ridiculous. I don't blame him personally because the restaurant should be better staffed to handle all customers no matter what time. Not one person doing everything because that can be difficult. But I do blame his attitude and rude way of telling me he won't. I had to walk out of the restaurant to prevent myself from yelling at him for telling me he won't do a smoothie. I'm going to pay for a smoothie and he wants to tell me he won't? That's dumb. So his name tag said Michael but the name on my receipt is Nathan B. It's a white male in his early 20s. He's always there at this time. He's always making sure his black suit jacket is nice and clean instead of checking on customers. He wears a black vest like he works at a high class restaurant. I always have an issue with his service because I come often late at night but it wasn't until today that I had it.  He also didn't put our Tatar sauce in the bag.  So that kid needs back up and a lesson on manners."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday at 9am.  We were seated immediately.  This location looks new.    The menu had odd options like salted caramel pancakes.  Enjoyed our breakfast.  Service was ok.  I like how the credit card machine automatically shows you the tip amounts.  Restroom was clean."}
{"text":"Of all places to go to at 4 AM, we ended up here. I'm accustomed to getting breakfast that costs no more than 5 bucks, but that isn't happening here so let's hope the food is worth the money.  FOOD QUALITY: Is between bad and mediocre depending on what you get. I disliked having a whole flop of grease on the grand slam skillet and how the ingredients seemed disproportionate. Too much egg, too much cheese, too little potato, barely any existent sausage, tasteless bell peppers, and tasteless mushrooms. Ungh.  SERVICE: Was great as our waiter was very energetic and cheery.   ENVIRONMENT: ...It's.. a Denny's. Plenty of tables but it gets really crowded and loud."}
{"text":"I wanted a chance to \"grand slam\" something. I have been accused of being \"too nice\" on most of my reviews - easy to explain... I don't usually bother to rate places I don't like.   2 stars for Denny's (...I don't understand how anyone rates anything 1 star... two is the lowest for me unless I am physically hurt by eating somewhere - Look, I understand if you're angry after a bad experience, but lets keep it in perspective - A pile of shit served cold in Iraq might rate 1 star, if you weren't hungry...)  This is the most pathetic excuse for dining there is. The food is generic and bland, the atmosphere is like a k-mart, and the crowd is just plain sad to be there (minus the after 2am drunken folks who don't know any better, or seniors who have few taste buds left).  Sure I have eaten here, rather than starve... but I'm sure not proud of it! If there were anything else open at 2am I doubt anyone with taste buds would waste their time.  Save your money (an extra dollar or two) and treat yourself to one of the dozens of GREAT breakfast spots in town. Life is too short to eat crap. Better to support good restaurants with your dollars - guess what? that breeds more good restaurants! Don't settle!"}
{"text":"Be careful with you check,today I did a big mistake. We came in early morning to this location,made orders,ate our food,and after our nice waitress gave us check,it was 15$. After 20 min we were going to pay,when probably manager,some employee from this restaurant came to me and yelled at me that I have to pay,because waitress had to go home,and he just took my card and after 5 min brought me back,without recipe where I should sigh. I left 3$ tip in cash,and we left, and later I discovered,they charged me 20$ instead of 15$,and I haven't even put my signature on the check."}
{"text":"Once again we had Kenny as our server. He is fantastic. Great personality. Gets everything right. Refills drinks promptly. Takes away old dishes and trash without being asked. He is the perfect balance of attentive without being annoying. I wish more servers were like him! The only downside is he doesn't usually start his shift until 10pm. If you go after 10 I absolutely HIGHLY recommend you ask for him!"}
{"text":"Went in at about 940pm. There were 4-5 people working and about 2 different guests eating. We were sat and told someone would be right with us. 20 minutes later and no one had come to say hi or take our order. All the employees were behind the counter talking and joking. We got up and walked up and will never return. What a horrible example of customer service."}
{"text":"I took 2 of my employees out for lunch and we picked to go here. It was around 3 when we got there on a Wednesday afternoon. Sat down and a waitress got the drinks. We tried to order a sampler with mozzarella sticks and chicken strips but the didn't have either of those? So that set a bad taste but we all just said fine we will order. I had the Brooklyn spaghetti and meatballs. One had a skillet and the 3rd had a breakfast order. There were 3 tables full so this place was empty. It took over 30 minutes to get the food to us. Then we did talk to server but she said the mgr was busy. We will not be taking our business there anymore"}
{"text":"The service was not that bad, the wait was no more than 10 minutes long. We were presented with a good server and our food took a little while but was expected with the crowd of orders before. I had the philly cheese steak omelet and it was alright but something I will not order again. We also had the jalape√±o honey bacon which was Really good. The pumpkin pancakes were really great and were smeared in like a cream cheese sauce. Overall I had a good experience at this location"}
{"text":"Yuck. Loaded baked potato soup is disgusting, bread that came with it was tasteless, salad was limp, boring and warm. Skillet had burnt veggies. Menus were sticky, decorations were tacky. There were staples in the walls with pieces of old, tacky decorations. I only saw two people in the building, our server and one woman. The kitchen was deserted. At least the pancakes and eggs were cooked properly. This location needs a new manager. Quick!"}
{"text":"Compared to other Denny's locations I've been to, this one is the best by far. We've gone here a few times now. Yesterday, there were four of us, and we had a large order. Everything that came out of the kitchen was very well prepared, hot, and came out quickly. Almost everything we ordered was breakfast, but I did also order a skillet meal with chicken, potatoes and broccoli. I've ordered skillets before at other locations and have been very disappointed. This skillet was perfect. Potatoes perfect, broccoli perfect, chicken PERFECT. It was fantastic. I'll go back just for this. Maybe even tomorrow. :)"}
{"text":"My bf and I are night owls and this Denny's is our favorite location. Not only do they make amazing and fresh food every time, they also provide incredible service. Hands down our favorite server is Aimee, she's friendly, attentive and already has our drinks ready for us by the time we get seated. I would definitely recommend this location and if you get Aimee know that you are in great hands. :)"}
{"text":"Overall summary of my experience at DENNYS  I was extremely pleased with the server and customer service she provided to my family and I.  The food was cooked all to perfection didnt have to send anything back  Everything was quality and was priced appropriate  Will be returning as soon as possible"}
{"text":"Surprisingly this is the best Denny's I've ever been to. The food was awesome (yummy) our server was attentive and nice, the place was clean. Nice and quiet. I must admit it was a good experience. All Denny's should be this way."}
{"text":"The employees at this location not only offer sub-par service, but lack the basic conversational skills to communicate with customers.   I placed an online order around 8:30pm last night for two entrees and an additional side of sausage. I paid for the order and noticed that I was missing the side of sausage by the time I got home. I then called the location and informed a young woman that I did not receive the side order I told her I would come back to pick up the missing item.    Once I arrived at the location to pick up the missing side, the young woman did not greet me or even say a single word to me. She just handed me the sausage, noticeably annoyed with the perceived inconvenience I caused.   I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"We've been to this Denny's several times. Wait, what, why Denny's from the guy that continually espouses the virtues of Butterfield's and Butter's in Scottsdale? Well, you see my life partner has leukemia which requires quarterly visits to Mayo Clinic. They do several blood tests and two hours later we see the doctor. The cafeteria at Mayo is adequate, but Denny's is a \"step up\" from the hospital food at Mayo and just down the street.   It's usually not too busy on a weekday morning and the crowd is much different at 10 AM on a Tuesday than it is at 2 AM on Sunday.   Oh yeah, the food, it's okay. Typical Denny's fare that you would expect at any location. Recently converted from another restaurant concept this one clean, modern and up-to-date. The service is hit or miss and the reason for the three stars vs. four or five.   We all know what to expect from Denny's and that's just what you'll get here. If you have more time and it's during their hours head on over to Butter's on Northsight, you'll enjoy the food much more. If you're at Mayo and want something a little better for breakfast, this is one of the closest options."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Friday morning. They def seem to cater to regulars bc we stood in the doorway for about 5 mins before someone acknowledged us. They need a hostess or a greater person  Lady came by the table a few times but it was like a hit and run. She was super nice and efficient but never stayed to be personable   Food was what you expect from a Dennys. Ordered the cinnamon cream cheese pancakes and french toast breakfast. The food was under seasoned while the pancakes were a sugar attack"}
{"text":"Not very Christmas-spirity of me to rip on the only place open. But my wife's eggs didn't taste right--not fresh, and my burger was Defcon-5 well done. I'd grade them on an easy curve if the food was edible, but 2 hits + 2 misses = 2 stars any day of the year."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised !! We flew into Phoenix for a wedding. We needed a quick bite! We checked into Marriott. We ordered a nice lunch. Prime Rib Cobb was great and my hubby had a Club sand. Service was fast and server was nice. We showed our hotel key and got 20% off! We had breakfast the next morning before our flight home. It was pretty good too!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok but Philly cheese sandwhich was not great.  Mom pare the senior discounted menu to the other menu and not much difference in price and you get less food. At least on the breakfast menu that's the way it was."}
{"text":"Hair in my pancake..  This is the only way ill send food back.  Other than that very friendly fixed the issue took 20% off;  its dennys..."}
{"text":"I got the lumber jack breakfast.  2 pancakes - better than I have ever had at any other Denny's.  But that's it, eggs were overlooked and replaced with over cooked scrambled  Bacon scraps that were over  and left overs from yesterday  Sausage overlooked and old.  Red skin potatoes were not even roasted they were deep fried a little. No taste at all but grease  Toast was cold and the butter on the bread did not even melt completely because it was cold as we'll   Ham slice was barely cooked as we'll   The waitress Donna was the only good thing in Denny's . It's said because this affects the wait staff with horrible food to the customer who would never return or recommend this Denny's .   Stay away!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work gathering. We booked here since they had a conference room. Service was good. Refills kept coming and food came out a decent time considering there were 18 of us. Dining room looked updated and clean. Checkout cashier could be a little quicker and friendlier."}
{"text":"A couple of coworkers and I dropped in late for supper. We are from out of town and attending a local convention. We were seated immediately and the waiter was very attentive and quick to bring out some coffee, then take our order. The food was good and our waiter did a great job. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Wow its been forever since I've last been to a Dennys. Our last visit ended at Wildfire Casino, and the manager was being really rude and in the end we got kicked out! :x ... We decided to go to this Denny's because 1) it was late and not many other places served breakfast food 2)tired of going to our usual places to eat. Anyways this place's rating is solely based on the food. We ordered from the $2, $4, $6, $8 menu: $2 Biscuits w/ gravy and hash browns, $4 all you can eat pancakes, $4 Fried cheese melt w/fries, and $7.99 Philly Swiss steak omelette. A lot of food for two people huh? LOL well I wanted to try a variety of things and we were starrrvvvingggg. I gotta say, the food would've been more enjoyable it the ac wasnt literally at 65 degrees and blowing right down at us. Our hash brown and food turn cold within minutes. So we found ourselves eating cold gravy, cold eggs, pancakes were okay, fries were cold, etc. Hmmm aside from the cold temp, I think the food would've still be mediocre. Our server was awesome though. It was a slow night for her so she was very attentive and had a cool conservation about public transport transits! If you are a fan of diner food this is the place to go and the food is fairly price. Only thing, MAKE SURE YOU SIT IN A NON VENTILATED AREA so at least your not covered in goosebumps and chills LOL."}
{"text":"NEGATIVE 6 STARS  ThIs was probably one of the worst experience at a restaurant I have ever had in my life. To start, our waitress barely ever came around and we waited a long time to order. My creamer curdled in my coffee. Then, I had to ask another waitress for a water because our waitress was never around, and when she did she slammed it on the table and gave a dirty look. When our food arrived the bacon was burnt to a crisp, eggs were runny and tasted terrible, jam was gross. The entertainment was the waitress YELLING at each other over where the coffee pot was. JUST MAKE ANOTHER POT!!  I think its safe to say I will never be back or recommend Dennys to anyone. The only reason I would recommend this place to anyone is if I hated them and wanted them to suffer like I did."}
{"text":"Great food great service.....Denny's never disappoints. Wonderful atmosphere chain restaurant cozy nice view"}
{"text":"First time at this location since the \"renovation\". Only thing I really noticed was new booths. It did look clean though. Had to wait a minute before being acknowledged and seated. Our server was very energetic and said \"you guys\" a lot. We came for dessert and decided on the original pancake puppies sundae and hot fudge brownie a la mode. We kinda wanted the caramel apple crisp too, but two was more than enough. The brownie came out first and was very hot and covered in fudge. It was tasty. Just as we finished, the pancake puppies came out. They were very fried and dense. I could barely get through one and then just ate the ice cream. Next time, caramel apple crisp!"}
{"text":"Worst Denny's experience in a long time. I ordered the Blueberry Pancake Breakfast with scrambled eggs (well done), hashbrowns, and bacon. It took a VERY long time to get our food. And there were only a handful of other diners there so I don't understand what took so long. When the food finally came out, there was butter on my blueberry pancake (I thought they did whipped cream on blueberry) and it was so melted and soaked into the pancake... We asked our server (young guy with arm tattoos that said \"God's Gift\") for another pancake without butter because we thought it came with whipped cream. He came back with two regular pancakes and a can of whipped cream. Are those regular pancakes? I wanted a new blueberry pancake! Moron. So I just said forget it and he took the regular pancakes away. The blueberry pancakes both had one side that was really crunchy. I have never seen that before and wondered how it was possible. It occurred to me that they must freeze the pancakes and maybe they got freezer burned on one side. I think that's the only explanation for the texture. Surprising, because I always thought they made them fresh. Also, the eggs were SO yellow! I have no idea what would make the eggs that bright yellow. Butter? They tasted normal, but wow. The bacon was the saddest bacon I've seen in awhile. Tiny, discolored, and mangled. And the hashbrowns were so oily, I lost my appetite halfway through. We were waiting for our check and our server hadn't returned after the pancake debacle. So I said let's just go up to the register to pay. We told the cashier we hadn't gotten our check yet. She tried to pull it up but said our server hadn't entered it yet. What? Really? So she stopped our server and asked him to enter our ticket. He went off to serve other tables as we stood there waiting. And waiting. And waiting. He wasn't coming back. The girl at the register got fed up and decided to enter it herself so we could pay and leave. What the hell, man?! It's like we offended our server by rejecting the pancakes and his feelings were so hurt that he chose not to help us anymore. So bizarre... We'll be frequenting an alternate location in the future."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on 6/16/14. We received very good service and meal came within a few minutes.Waitress could have smiled more but was friendly.  I had a Grand Slam... it was more than enough food.  Meal was very tasty... We will definitely go back.  It is a popular Denny's."}
{"text":"How ca I relate to my two encounters in LV with the Dennys across from the Mirage.  Both times service sucked.  Food was cold and an overall horrible experience from a iconic chain diner"}
{"text":"I gave Denny's a five star review? Yes, indeed I did. I do understand that Denny's food and dining experience isn't all top notch, fancy or legendary, but my and my pals sure do enjoy coming down to this certain Denny's. I probably won't ever visit any other one.  Pro: There's nothing wrong with diner food at 2am! Or any other time that is, they are ALWAYS open, 24/7, 365. Pro: Another reason why we like to come is is because our lovely waitress Layla! She is so nice and always tends to our needs and wants. She's so friendly and personable too! Although she's a cook and a waitress, if you can get her as a waitress, you're in for a happy time with good service indeed.  If you can get her as a cook, I would recommend you get the Zesty Nachos, she's puts a lot of care into them for sure. YUM!  Pro: if you're ballin' on a budget, they've got a value menu, $2 ($2 slice of French Toast has my heart), $4, $6, $8. They also have a senior menu too, 55+. They have GREAT prices even though they're prices aren't at all bad.  Con: They were a few times where the service wasn't up to par, but we found Layla, so it's all good! You bet this Denny's docked star was earned back all thanks to Layla! This is my permanent late hang out for sure. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, milkshakes, snacks and even holiday meals and more. What more could ya want?!"}
{"text":"Order take out at 8:00 am they said my breakfast would be ready in 15 minutes when I got there they had just put my order to be cooked according to my receipt so if you order take out and want to be at work on time don't do it. For $26 meal was not worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I placed a to-go order for small nachos on a Friday night. Believe it or not, Denny's nachos are really good! They use a liquid cheese, plus shredded cheddar cheese, taco meat, salsa, and sour cream. It doesn't require any real cooking, it's pretty straightforward.   Tonight, we were told that the order would be ready in 10 minutes. Nearly 25 minutes later, I received my order of nachos. I mentioned to the manager on duty that it should not take 25 minutes for nachos. (Especially when only two tables have patrons.) He cut me off to explain (twice) that they only have only one cook tonight. His tone was harsh, and he was not apologetic. As a customer, 1) I could care the least about scheduling issues, 2) management should demonstrate the highest level of customer service, and  3) I'm sorry goes a long way.   I happened to have a colleague on the phone when I was speaking to the manager. She was appalled at his unprofessionalism too.   Although I wish this were just a one-off situation, I've consistently encountered issues at this particular Denny's. Historically, Denny's has had issues with serving people who look like me. I hope we are not going back to 1994."}
{"text":"Okay. It's Denny's. It is diner food and it is great. I love coming here late at night and drinking surprisingly decent coffee and previously frozen pie. I love this location."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Denny's all my life- we are up early one morning during our visit to Vegas and decide to walk over there for breakfast, expecting the quality service we are used to by this establishment : but we were wrong . The waitstaff was very inattentive and by the time I received my food ( biscuits and gravy) it was very cold and congealed . I ended up not eating it at all - good thing it was on the 4$ menu- so I only wasted a few dollars - and you definitely get what you pay for !"}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick bite to eat whilst doing the usual weekend errands.  Was I disappointed? Read on....  Location & Aesthetics -- located on West Bell Road just before you reach the 303 junction.   It's the turn into Sam's Club but on your left. Parking directly in front of Denny's can be a challenge as there aren't that many parking spaces and the restaurant shares the lot with some other businesses.  I parked further down and walked which wasn't that far a walk. Interior -- very small but not too small that you're brushing against other patrons or brushing against chairs and tables.  Restaurant was clean and well lit.  Comfortable chairs and the tables were clean.   Noise level was average.  Waiting area was somewhat spacious.  Service -- could be a little hit and miss here, though more miss than hit in my opinion.  I was seated immediately and asked if I'd like a table or booth, and chose the latter.   Server, despite chatting and socializing with the folks in the adjacent booth, took some time to come across, greet me, and take drink orders (-1). Drink orders were taken but it took some time to be brought to the table.  Server apologized for the delay stating she had to take care of an emergency at another table (-1).  Menu -- very easy to comprehend but seemed limited to me.  I'm not asking to be overwhelmed, but at the same time, I'm asking for some variety.  Food -- one word -- insipid.  Ordered the chicken fried steak with 2 sides -- broccoli and steamed vegetables (zucchini and squash).   The chicken fried steak was okay -- bland and not very well seasoned or spicy.  It was smothered with a cream sauce that was also extremely bland and did nothing to complement the chicken fried steak.  I'm not even sure why it was there in the first place. Broccoli was not even full heads but smaller broken up pieces of varying color that was not green; and not well steamed, and on the cold-in-temperature side.  The same could be said for the zucchini and squash -- not well steamed, not flavorful, not warm or hot enough, and on the soggy side (-1).  Despite my rating, I may return to try some of their signature breakfast items/dishes as those seemed to be the popular choices among the patrons, but otherwise, I will be staying away from the items in the dinner-plate section of their menu.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Under cooked hash browns A lot of Other people that came after us got their food before we did. Our waiter Luis was great, courteous and patient. I feel bad for him, he was all over the place trying to wait on sooo many tables. The employees need help!!!!! Corporate needs to get involved and hire more people."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a Denny's. The location looked quite and peaceful, but was anything but. The waitresses had really bad attitudes, and were shocked that all I wanted to eat was pancakes. Am I the only person who has ordered just pancakes from Denny's. The cook burned by pancakes to a very very dark brown, I'm not sure about this, but are pancakes supposed to be kind of crispy? The cook have me dirty looks from the kitchen all night long. I really just wanted to leave as soon as I ordered. I can't go back there for fear of the bad service, but I will tell people about this location."}
{"text":"I'm a Denny's lover and have been for years. AlaYa the foto place with friends when we want a cheap filling meal where we can sit and chat for hours. Friday night 5/19/17 was my first visit to this location after a less than mediocre visit to Sand Bar and it did not disappoint. Kelly was the server for two of my friends and myself. He has such a fantastic personality and made sure we were taken care of during our visit. He delighted us when he let us know that this location serves alcohol so we were able to get an adult beverage to supplement our midnight breakfast. If you like an interactive experience with your server, I'd definitely check this location out."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER   My mom got late for work because we waited 2 hour of being seated and our food.Worst Service im Never Coming Here"}
{"text":"Crazy waitress, way to fidgety like she was tweaking, dirty tables and booths, food in my cup and ants on and table. The place smelt very very bad like spilt rotting food and mold."}
{"text":"Had not eaten at a Denny's in years and sadly I think it will be years before I eat at one again.  We choose to dine here because there was outdoor seating with a parade happening and we thought it would be fun to eat breakfast and watch all of the action. Firstly,the restaurant had an awful sewer smell. We received our breakfast and everything on my plate tasted like frankenfood. The scrambled eggs did not taste like eggs. The toast was stale and the hashbrowns were awful. It was the worst breakfast I think I have ever had because the ingredients did not even taste real. My boyfriends breakfast was better than mine, but still nothing to write home about. The best part of the morning was being able to have a front row seat to watch the parade, the 2 for 1 mimosas our server recommended to us and our server. She was attentive and extremly genuine. 1 Star Restaurant   5 Star Server"}
{"text":"I hoped this would be my Toronto's equivalent of the Montreal's 24/7 Dunn's for a late night meal... but it will not...   Place was almost empty, but food took too long to come and was not even exactly what I ordered (the waiter acknowledged right away and returned the plate to the kitchen...why didn't he notice himself before bringing the plate?... and 5 minutes more to wait to have half my plate replaced, while the other half cooled down...). Bland but likely safe food."}
{"text":"Its was pretty dreadful! I came in with a group of 4. The waitress didn't make everyone feel welcome. She would be polite to 2 people in the group but then when I tried to participate in the conversation or ask for assistance I was treated poorly. I then ordered my food. My burger had no salt or pepper on it, the bun, lettuce and all condiments were soggy and lazily put on. My fries were wet. After given the food the Waitress did not check on us for 20-30 mins. When she did return I was agitated because the rest of my group had eaten and I had not. Granted the place did pick up in business however the waitress could have easily asked a team member or management to help in checking on customers. I then spoke with management, he did try to rectify the situation by offering to make another burger, but at this point I had no trust in the establishment to re-create the food. Denny's Continues to be a dreadful place to eat. From Poor Service to lazy food put together."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I'm Not sure why it takes over an hour to make eggs. We were treated horribly and forced to starve to death. Only one table served every 30mins. Have more than one person working."}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill. Service was very slow and the food was marginal. The bacon was hard and nearly tasteless. The pancakes were blah. The hashbrowns were overcooked.  It took a long tim  e to get our check.  Would not go back here."}
{"text":"Just went here again and it was a complete disaster. The waitress had a serious attitude problem, the manger was not helpful, the food order was wrong, the tables and sliver wear was dirty. I used to love this place but I changed my mind. Don't waste your money here. Go to IHOP or Steak & Shake. I'll never go back here and advise others to go someplace else to eat."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Was sat with in 5min Then waited over 15min and still no serve, no water, no acknowledgement from ANY STAFF. waited a few more the walked out smh It's mid day your not busy. I would totally understand it was a busy Sunday or Saturday morning which still doesn't excuse shity service but this was not the case at all."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 0... My family and I went today (Saturday) after the morning rush... It wasn't packed at all... Maybe 10-15 tables and plenty of waiters and waitresses. They were probably over-staffed in my opinion. We were seated and provided drinks right away. That's the extent of my positive review on this place. I literally watched as our food sat in the serving window for 15 minutes while Wanda, our waitress, was gossiping behind the counter with all of the other waiters. She FINALLY brought us our food, which was warm just above room temperature. She also brought us the check at the same time... Weird right?! Usually the waiter will wait until you've finished your meal before presenting you with the check. After that, she NEVER stopped by our table again... Not to see how the meal was, not to offer to refill our drinks, not even to offer us boxes when we were clearly done eating... I had to get the attention of another waitress (she was actually one of two waitresses that was actually productive while everyone else was slacking off) to refill our drinks. I looked around for a manager, not one in sight. We literally were so turned off, that we just paid the check and left... Right after we left, I proceeded to call to see if a manager was available. I was put on hold by Tristan, the boy at the front desk. When I asked to speak to the manager, he asked me to hold.... But he didn't actually put me on hold. He said \"I have lady asking to talk to a manager and I need someone to pretend to be a manager.\" I had the conversation on speaker phone and my husband and I just looked at each other in disbelief. At this point, another guy gets on the line and says his name is Chris and he is the manager. Told him that I heard what Tristan just told him and wanted to speak with a real manager. To which he didn't say anything to me, turned to Tristan and said she heard what you said, wants to talk to a real manager and is pissed. There was clearly chaos going on, and I heard Tristan say \"what am I supposed to do, there isn't a manager\" at this point I just hung up. The whole situation was laughable... It's so pathetic how things are run at this store. The staff obviously need to have a manager on duty at all times for constant supervision otherwise, this place will fail. More importantly, it will deserve to fail with their lack of service."}
{"text":"Had to stop in for breakfast during our recent trip. As always the place was packed. They turn the tables fast so relax and wait. Also an extremely friendly staff especially with the crowd, they know how to hold it together!"}
{"text":"Typical Denny's food, HORRIBLE service.  We waited over an hour and a half for mozzarella sticks!  I wont even tell you how long it took to get the burgers.  The waitresses reason, because another waitress took her plates.  Give me a break, and just tell me you forgot to put them in.  It's 4 am, I've been drinking, and I had casino's bullshitting me all night.  Get my food, throw it on a plate. let me eat in peace, tip and pay, and be on my merry way."}
{"text":"So far so good. Nothing negative to say about them \"yet\"... Been here a few times, and they have always been good experiences..."}
{"text":"This is the worst Denny's ever. The pancakes and hashbrowns weren't cooked all the way I ordered extra broccoli and they gave me three pieces. They did not give me syrup for them. Chrissy the worker said we couldn't have a chair on the side of the table but on the other side there was a stroller next to a table. The food wasn't good and they don't know how to cook and they are supposed to have a cooking license. The cookers looked Mexican and that they use other people's information so they can work."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving this such a low rating, is to bring attention to this store's urgent need to fix the system of how they do things. I know customer experience when it comes to service and food quality can vary depending on a couple of factors and so I will not base my rating off of this, although tonight's was unfortunately slow and confusing, I am primarily talking about the way that we are able to pay for our food. I still do not understand why we have to go all the way up to the front and present a printed receipt and stand in line for 45 minutes while everyone else in front of us is also waiting to pay, and only one cashier is able to facilitate that entire process. PLEASE EXPEDITE THIS! The most simple solution is what every other restaurant does, when you ready to pay they bring you your check and you pay directly. Thank you for your consideration."}
{"text":"Terrible service, I wasn't served for over 15 minutes. No one even looked our way or even brought us waters. Don't tell me your a 24 dennys if you can't serve me a fuckin pancake at 2am. Very upset"}
{"text":"I was seated at a booth, and watched every server walk past my table without so much as even speaking. This is my second time coming to this location and if you read my initial review, you will wonder why I even came back a second time. After 15 minutes, of no one speaking I left. The restaurant was NOT crowded at all. There were MAYBE 4 booths of people and 2 others sitting at the counter. There's no reason when I shouldn't have had water and the opportunity to submit an order. Definitely won't be a third time"}
{"text":"Been coming here an average of once a week for overs year and got to know most of the staff and service is great! I'm treated very well and in the mornings after work I'm greeted with cheerful waiters eager to make my breakfast a great Denny's experience. Awesome customer service, I never had a problem with my order and this place is excellent in refilling my drink, will keep coming plus they proved free wifi for a geek tetchy gamer I am."}
{"text":"Come ON, Arizona!  A Denny's on every major highway and by every Ramada?  Denny's faux sit down dining fast food with insulting senior options tastes like giving up and giving in.  To the American stereotype of food that's a fat and sugar cocktail and requires no palette challenge to nom.  The colorful people I saw like the grizzled backpacker in the impossibly gaudy parrot take off on the Hawaiian shirt, the guy in the cowboy hat with super long whiskers who was kind of like meth head Willy Nelson glowering in a booth, the obese, commanding possibly Native American person of ambiguous gender sitting in a center table can't be made up.  But, little was close by in terms of restaurants and it was dark.    If I was already there, I was going to try food off the Hobbit menu if I was going to eat anything because the burger with all possible breakfast foods slammed on top scared me, specifically hash browns bacon an egg cheese sauce on a cheese bun (did I miss anything?)  So I ordered the Hobbit special red velvet pancake puppies and Shire skillet. My sentiment play by play as I tried the red dye 40 pancake puppies (basically deep fried donut holes with a Duncan Hines frosting sauce) as it debased my will power was this.  The effect was indescribable, but I tried:  Mmm...self loathing.   I can see the appeal.  It is soul food..but like for the writhing, loathing child inside the soul.  Sugared fried crusted food with a sugar dip and red dye 40 for your tormented, writhing inner child..   Like, what the people in the hell fire Bosch paintings want is pancakes...pancake puppies.  This kind of thing makes one's will power fat.  Puritans no doubt made it illegal because it causes impure thoughts.   Who wouldn't agree to anything if their hungry ghost is continually being fed?   Occupy Wall Street?  Eff that, I want yum yums.  I'm occupying this spot right herr. Omnomnom..yes Patriot Act.. Omnom... bring our troops home.   Oh my god, it's a symphony of fats sugars and preservatives.  It will survive plastic.   Even this garlic bread is perfectly calibrated... Pancake puppies are the equivalent of (redacted) in the dark to Disney movies.  (I was being edgy.)  Meaning they're the Kathy Geiss of food.  The shire skillet was a hot oval pan of two okay somewhat runny inside poached eggs, home fries, pepper and a large, somewhat grainy, unfrozen smoking sausage.  The Hobbit myth of the \"Shire second breakfast skillet\" and large hot plate appealed to my senses of abundance. I doused it in Cholula and kind of enjoyed it.  Even though I acted like a hipster at Applebee's, I did enjoy the Shire Skillet, pancake puppies, and two Cokes that will speed my Ashkenazi genetic ills.  The crawling open mouthed desire beast in me was satisfied and I was fully docile until I had an inexplicable headache and tummy ache a couple hours later.  I think this is the seedling of the American nightmare.  Unchallenging food perfectly calibrated in sugars, fats, and salts to quell the rebellious ego."}
{"text":"Hi I use to love Denny's as kid today I thought we would go to Denny's that was right there On the corner of Bell and 32 nd in Phoenix Az .  As we walked in no friendly hellos as I remembered as a kid , we were sat in a filthy booth , served a coffee with lip stick on the cup . When we brought this to the attention of the female server she said nothing just picked up the cup and left to get more which we declined and stuck w the water . Ordering I thought the picture of nachos looked great my friend had steak and eggs . The food arrived before we could even get excited the cheese on my nacho was brown , tomato's shriveled meat looked disgusting. But my friends had a steak knife w her steak you know the big ones , it looked like ppl had eaten off it . It was filthy. At this point we asked for management and guess what manager wasn't surprised . DENNYS BELL AND 32 nd Phoenix AZ a defiant no ."}
{"text":"Great place , always go around 12 am , the waitresses are awesome and do their best, they always are nice and get our food at a reasonable time frame.  On the other hand there's a male waiter that's kinda just eh, but other then him it's great for late night eats, especially cause I always come with about 3 to 7 people"}
{"text":"Had a senior special that came out cold cheese not melted, it was reheated much better hot but shouldn't have to take 2 tries. Also had endless pancakes there was a lot of waiting for the first 2 cakes and waiting between next rounds."}
{"text":"Ordered unlimited pancakes there were ok but took a while to get refills. Wife ordered a meal that came out uncooked and still cold. But they did provide another meal that much better."}
{"text":"Do not go to this Denny's. WORST service we have ever experienced. We were immediately seated with menus but were ignored for 20 mins. The waiter finally came to take our drink orders & we also placed our food order. We did not get out drinks until 15 mins later after ordering and to top it off our coffees were cold. Not one time did our waiter Sophia come by to ask if we wanted refills and his shirt wasn't tucked in and his badge was on upside down. Also our silverware looked dirty and when my daughter asked for new silverware she stated our waiter mentioned something to his coworkers who then looked towards our table and made a rude facial expression. We just decided to then leave since the staff were by the kitchen in the back looking towards our direction and even though we couldn't hear what they were saying we all knew they were talking about us. We did leave since we were uncomfortable and didn't know how our food would be prepared. We did explain to the people at the front register our reason for leaving which she was just smirking and smiling. We always eat at Denny's and love it but we have never ever been treated that way in any restaurant before. I wish I could give zero stars to this Denny's but it wouldn't let me. The management at this particular Denny's needs to impress upon the staff how important customer service is and also start cleaning their utensils and dishes much better. We definitely will never frequent this particular Denny's in the future."}
{"text":"we visited this Denny's the second time and it was  ok. Nice service, no long waiting for food or beverages.   We had an Every Day Value Slam and Eggs In A Basket. Both were good and delicious.  Coffee refilled several times.  Overall a nice breakfast and a restaurant beside the Strip."}
{"text":"One thing you have to realize with Denny's is that when you get there, expect to sit a while before you are helped. It has nothing to do with bad service (yeah I know I will get some arguments). We mentioned it to the GM who was working at the register one night when we were there. He said that he wanted to hire more servers because he didn't feel there was enough, but corporate wouldn't allow it. The service at Denny's is notoriously slow so my husband and I occupy ourselves with our toddler and our cell phones. Sometimes we are waited on quickly and just wait a while for our food. Tonight, the food wasn't great, but I was hungry. My daughter enjoyed it and I enjoyed not having to pay for her to eat lol there was only one waitress on the floor who seemed to be doing anything productive. My husband and I would occasionally see other servers out there, but the one who was actually working was doing an awesome job! Wish I could've gotten her name because she deserves some recognition."}
{"text":"Our office has been trying to call in an order since a few minutes after noon and it is now 12:45 pm and the phone number just rings busy.  We are starting to believe they have the phone off the hook...what terrible customer service!!!  The three of us would just like to get some lunch since we are \"confined\" to the office today!!!"}
{"text":"Came to breakfast with my family and ordered nothing special but their $4 grand slams. Pretty simple since it comes with pancakes, eggs and either bacon or sausage. For some odd reason, my order came out totally wrong multiple times. Each time they brought it out, something was wrong. First they served me over medium with bacon and no pancakes and no toast as I ordered it for an extra barge. I ordered the grand slam with scrambled eggs, sauce, pancakes and sour dough toast. It came out with over medium eggs, bacon and no pancakes and toast. When I asked for my pancakes I was told they are still cooking. When I asked for my toast they brought it white. One thing after another. Sad, it was not a special order with a bunch or replacements.   Ralph was our server. Nice but a bit off. He repeated our order so I don't know how only mine was all screwed up.   I don't come to Denny's often. Maybe once a year, if that. Now I was reminded of why."}
{"text":"Open tables and they said there was a 20 minute wait. The host said they were unable to seat us because the kitchen was backed up. We just wanted to be seated and have our coffee -- we wouldn't even had ordered our food, we just wanted to be seated.   Not good business practice in my opinion."}
{"text":"Horrible! Ordered a single waffle to go, waited 40 min for it still nothing. Finally went to complain and the manager gave me money back and said \"I'll go check if it's up and still give it to you.\" Went back for 10 min and never came back out."}
{"text":"i was very displeased. the service was very bad and when I asked for condiments and some water it came when I was all ready to leave. the servers were very rude and talked very low. The food was kind of hard and not at all what I expected. the only good thing there were the seasoned fries. I don't recommend for anyone. try the Hard Rock Cafe, that place is much better."}
{"text":"I want to give a huge about out to an absolutely amazing server. His name is Joshua. And last Thursday, June 1st.  We stopped in for dinner.  Now when we arrived it wasn't busy at all. However, within no time the diner became extremely busy. Joshua was the only server available.  Truly,  he was overwhelmed.  But he was doing a 5 star job. He handled our table of 4 in addition to the other tables that had multiple patrons. He was absolutely AWESOME.   When we were finished with our meal and went to the register to pay we found out that the additional server was running late.  So there was only the manager and Joshua.   5 stars to Joshua and your perfect service."}
{"text":"This place has the best Hamburgers. It's better than Hard Rock Cafe!! Order season fries, too. You will not be disappointed. Came here for the Solo trading cards. Found my new burger place."}
{"text":"Ok, like Angelo T., I keep wonering why I walk in there from time to time.  The breakfasts are passable, at late night the place is a zoo with some of the most unuusal animals of the Calgary streets, and I keep getting truly horrible service there (though admittedly one week day a few weeks back, I did get some kick ass service from this one asian server...but of course the breakfast was comped because I screamed murder about a REALLY bad night when a 1/2 empty restaurant with a full staff, and it took them over 45 minutes and me LEAVING the place to get noticed).  I just can't find it in myself to want to give them another chance.  Even though this Denny is literally 5 min walking distance, I'd much rather drive the 7-10 min to the Deerfoot Meadows Denny's.  Look.  I got way better service at the Denny's at Deerfoot Meadows, and the food admittedly is the same.  If you really want your breakfast at a Denny's, go THERE.  Still 24 hours, but not a zoo at night, much more relaxed and pleasant, and the late night staff there seems to be on the ball."}
{"text":"After a horrific experience at the Macleod Trail Denny's. I went straight here for a late night breakfast.  All I can say, while the place was 1/2 empty and there was only 1 server, he managed to cover the entire place, was attentive and fast.  Breakfast was about average for any Denny's, but I knew what I was expecting too.  I would say, if you really want a Denny's experience, go here.  Way more relaxed."}
{"text":"I visit Denny's quite often. For personal and professional use. Today was especially awesome with Jenifer as our server. We have had service by her. Each time even better. My favorite place for breakfast."}
{"text":"This Dennys is the worst! They are so rude and do not listen at all. I placed an order for pick up and when I called Monica was having side conversations and obviously didn't know how to take phone orders. When we got it home it so completely wrong and inedible.  I seriously wouldn't give it to my dogs. I called them and the girl who answered named Monica was so beyond rude and disrespectful.  She was the person who took my order to begin with and was the one who made the mistake. She gave her phone to her \"manager\" who was not listening to a thing I was say he kept getting what I was saying completely wrong. I was then passed on to someone else who really could care less about my complaint. I will be just driving the extra 5 minutes to go anywhere else. I will never go here again. Wish I could give them negative stars"}
{"text":"Horrible costumer services!! Especially to students! You would think that they would treat everyone with respect , but sadly they do not! Even though they weren't busy at all... the server lack the most important part of her job, which was costumer service.This location is across from the campus and it's horrible. Pick somewhere else to study and get lunch/dinner at trust me!You will feel definitely unwanted here."}
{"text":"Made a Yelp account just to warn others of this Dennys. I am doing this from the toilet where I am begging my body to relinquish the greasy poison I have eaten so that the pain in my stomach will finally go away.   I ordered the 3 way platter of chicken strips, mozzarella sticks and cheese Quesadillas. I would not of bought this is I was aware the cheese was laced with some type of poison that latches onto the stomach walls and just burns away. Or at least that is what this feels like.   I am also certain that this food was the cause because it is the only thing I have eaten in the last 14 hours. I will ever be eating here again which is a shame because it is close to one of my favourite bars. Even if I were to be loaded enough to not feel a knife stabbing through my hand, if I were to walk into Dennys order food and wait 12  hours I'd be at risk to be back on this toilet. I'd call my family for help, they would call an ambulance for me. I'd hear on the call, \"yes his hand has a knife through it and is bleeding everywhere!\" to which I'd respond \"Forget the damn knife! I need my stomach pumped ASAP!\".   Good cheese cake though."}
{"text":"When I heard that a new Denny's location opened up right near my friend's apartment, we had to give it a try - have many great memories getting full at many of their American locations.   ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE:  This location is open  24 hours a day, which makes it a perfect spot for some late night grub. Even at the late hour (around 12am), the surprisingly large and clean restaurant was still fully staffed. I was quite impressed with our waitress Lina's personable and efficient customer service. Relatedly, I didn't realize there were at least 10+ methods of preparing an egg until our waitress recited it for us, two times!   FOOD:  I went with the classic Grand Slam breakfast (2 sausages, 2 pieces of bacon, scrambled eggs, and hash browns). The eggs were a bit on the dry side for my taste, as I opted not to include additional cheese/hot sauce as offered as an option. The sausages were plump and juicy, the bacon crisp but not burnt...the hash browns were actually the best I've had in a while, fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside mmm.  SUMMARY:  For a late night snack, you can't beat all-day breakfast at Denny's. Though our visit was during a less busy time of the day, seems service here is actually pretty efficient and attentive too."}
{"text":"My son wanted to eat here before we went to the movies. Big mistake! The service sucks. Unless you're Asian then they check on you like crazy. We didn't get asked if we needed anything until we were on our last bites."}
{"text":"I will never eat at another Denny's again. The good: Staff was great, very friendly, and make it feel like a relaxing place to enjoy your food, but the food is the problem. Food tasted horrible, and for what they charge is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've never had an order messed up as badly as I did at this Denny's, and it wasn't like they were packed either. I asked them to replace the bacon in my lumberjack slam with an extra ham, my girlfriend asked them to replace the bacon with sausage links.   They just took the bacon out without the replacement. Absolutely disgraceful.  Unfortunately, it was a to-go order, and when I called in regarding it, they basically said \"too bad\". Pathetic."}
{"text":"We came here on a sunday after church and boy was it packed. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated (5 of us). Apparently the restaurant was recently remodeled and this shows. The interior looks very clean. I ordered a skillet that had potatoes, egg, chicken, mushrooms, and cheese on top. The food was OK. The food wasn't better than any other Denny's that you've been to and was mediocre. Service was also meh. We only saw our waitress once after the initial order.  Maybe I should have ordered a pancake breakfast because everyone else at my table had fantastic looking (and tasting) breakfasts.   I gave this only 2 stars because i ordered my eggs to be made over-easy but they came out as scrambled."}
{"text":"i liked this dennys because it is near the polo towers a little south of the hotel on the east side of las vegas blvd ( close to m & m 's and would of ate here almost everyday if it wasnt so crowded . if you get there to late then the line is outside the door into the street everyday. try to get there before  9:00 a.m. its a good thing i eat early about 7:00 - 7:30 a.m. so i got in fast .   they have the $ 2 - 4 - 6 - $ 8 menu . plus the regular menu for a little higher price  then the prices in boca raton  but still much cheaper then most hotels near by. the coffee is $ 2.00   the food taste the same as it does in florida not to good not to bad and always plenty of grease. i ordered the all you eat pancakes $ 4.00 . big mistake because i didnt stop at just 3 . or sometimes i oredered  the  biscut with gravy and french fries   the service is good considering its dennys. its worth going to if you dont want to spend $ 15.00 - $ 20.00 for an all you can eat breakfast"}
{"text":"I think I just walked into a dimmed funeral- that's how bad the environment was here. I literally had to whisper during my entire dining experience or else everyone in the whole restaurant could hear my conversations. You can hear people eating as well as kitchen staff stacking plates and moving pots to the dishwasher. I asked the manager to at least turn on the background music (yes, they have speakers people) and he literally looked and walked away from me as if I didn't exist. I literally politely asked and I was walked away from. Oh... it gets worse, when we walked in, there was a strange little booth by the host stand with a man (employee?) sitting eating/working - very odd. After being seating, took 10 minutes to be acknowledged... I get it, it's Dennys and don't expect anything great, but this place is weird. Feels like the beginning of a horror movie, so quiet... awaiting our death by the Texas Chainsaw Man coming in from the dark and rainy outside - not the Scottsdale restaurant experience you'd want. #SAD"}
{"text":"Nothing major to report on the food that hasn't already been said about any other Denny's. Typical Denny's food with typical Denny's flavor. If you've never been to a Denny's before this chain has an extensive breakfast menu that you can customize at your choosing. They have 'Fit' items that are great for those of you who are healthy consious. One of my favorite's is the Loaded Veggie Omelet which I had today. I substituded the hash browns for fruit which you can do at no extra cost.   I don't know if any other Denny's has \"Pan Cake Puppies\" but this particular won does. I tried the Red Velvet Pan Cake Puppies and they serve it with a cream chesse syrup dip. It's very, very good.   The place is fairly clean and location is ideal for the DTLV tourist. It has a full bar, at the end where you can sit in the patio area and get some primo people watching time in! Specially after midnight. Yes, I did say bar, as in you can grab a brew or have a shot of Te-killya with your Denny's meal.   The three stars were given because of the service. It could definitely have been better. I feel bad saying that since the server was polite and courteous but that's about it. Polite and courteous is only part of your tip. He never came around to check on us once we ordered even though he passed by our table several times.. He had to be flagged down each time.   The food took about 30 minutes to come out and it wasn't really that busy. Ok, maybe they were short staffed, but who isn't now-a-days. Before the food even came out my son and I ordered coffee. He only bought one creamer. We ask for more creamer and it took him about 10 minutes to get the creamer to us. That is a long time in the restaurant world just to get creamer. For the most part that's understandable if you're rushing and simply forgot. We are all human. When we ordered a coffee refill, we also ordered more sugar packets, he came back with the coffees but this time no creamer. We ask for creamer and again reminded him of the sugar packets. The creamer came but the sugar never made it.   This is not an isolated incident, I've been here 3-4 times on different days of the week and different times and the service is pretty much the same. You generally have to get the servers attention to be taken care of once you make your initial order. I would actually give this place 2 stars but bumped it up to 3 because, well, they have a bar...come on, tell me that's not worth the extra star."}
{"text":"May 1, 2018 was the worst experience ever we got there at 10:30 they sat us down in 10 mins, 30 mins has pasted by and no one has not attended us we had to call out to a waiter to get our order started, 20 mins has passed by we started getting inpatient we called out to the manager he said he'll check on our food never return.. 20 mins later we just decided to get up and leave hungry and un satisfied. No apologies from the manager or anything."}
{"text":"There's a real health problem at this location and it may have to do with what I read was \"new management\"!  There was a remodeling done that took out a wall that was across the front of the kitchen and replaced that wall with a counter and high seats. In addition, the air conditioner does not function properly. This is deadly in an area like Surprise (suburb of Phoenix) during the summers so the waitresses are sweating like crazy between the outside heat and the heat from the kitchen.  They try to function efficiently (or at least some do) but sweat is running down their faces. Inevitably, while they are rushing around rolling up silverware in napkins, getting food and drinks for patrons, they reach up for a quick wipe to keep it from falling down into food and utensils...but, of course, it doesn't always work! Plus one of the waitresses had such an itchy head from sweating that she would scratch it sometimes...and then touch everything (she was really working hard, but feeling awful).  The owner is being cruel to his wait staff and creating serious health violations by not fixing this situation whether it is a bad remodel, a faulty air conditioner, or both.  I will NOT go back here again. Other people in town have said this is a terrible Denny's and they mentioned other locations as being the place to go."}
{"text":"I just wanna say Laurie is amazing, she took our order prompt, and and forgot that I ordered my drink with no ice, she quickly apologized and brought another one, after I insisted that it was okay. I liked her vibe and service. Thank you Laurie."}
{"text":"Everytime I come in here it's the same story, 1 cook, no-one hosting, and you're waiting 20-40 minutes for your food. The doors always have fingerprints on them and it feels very ghetto."}
{"text":"Today I came to Denny's with the appetite for dinner food... Left very disappointed. After a short wait to be seated,  the noise wasn't even a factor. It was more that our server brought me a half cup of hot chocolate, (even after i put 5packets of milk inside was not even at 3\4 cup). Btw, I drank my hot chocolate before the food came... our server came with the food not even a glance or time to say I wanted a water or another hot chocolate, she left and returned a very long wait after, with empty cups and forgotten in the back booth. In the corner.. Sad Sad experience."}
{"text":"Management at this location is terrible. How could you be a nationwide chain and not have capability to void a receipt so that I could adequately tip your employee.?!"}
{"text":"Food is the same as all Dennys, just slower service. It really doesn't matter what time of day, it will be slow."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch one day and was sat promptly. I ordered a Grand Slam with extra crispy hash browns. When my food came out my hash browns looked like they were a part of a horror movie. They were burnt, black and just looked thrown on the plate. My waitress was pretty upset about it and got me some new hash browns pretty quickly. The staff was very friendly but the cooks aren't on there \"A\" game. Other then that, this place was alright."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick breakfast and everything and everyone was amazing. Crystal was my server, very nice, accommodating and fast.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is a Denny's I will definately stay away from! The manager does not know how to deal with her staff at all. A lot of gossip and let's her staff TRY to handle things instead of her doing it. Everytime you go in the workers act like they don't even want to be there just sad! Sitting there listening to them point blame on each other instead of working as a team. Not what I want to hear while I'm eating."}
{"text":"WAY TO STEP IT! This was more than what I expected from my last experience at Denny's, it was the usual look, not too packed, kinda funny smelling like old food that's been there for awhile but not enough to turn me away!  Our server Eric was pretty good very attentive that's always a plus, the food came pretty quick I guess because we have 5 kids just feels like it's always gonna take forever but not today.  Our Breakfast to my surprise was actually better than what I expected, I think I got 3 eggs (cooked hard), 2 pieces of bacon (I didn't like as much to thin and soft) and 2 slices of toast.  Overall the experience was better than what I expected, the service was good and the food was also better than expected.  I love when I go to a place where my last visit was not as good and they step it up on my next one! Keep up the good work Denny's!"}
{"text":"Worst Denny's ever. My wife and I waited for 45 minutes for a to go order. I truly believe we only waited so long because we were starving. I asked one cashier for a refund and her exact word were, \"I can't give you a refund.\" It was an Asian lady. Even after seeing people who order 10-15 minutes after us get there food before us they managed to give us the wrong order. Also not giving me the eggs I paid for. The service here is heinous and unfit. They offered to give us some complimentary items but at 4:45 am I didn't have the patience for it. They're lucky I can't give them zero stars."}
{"text":"Right across from where I stayed, I weighed the choices after a heavy night of drinking. I thought to myself...nope...then I went upstairs and saw that they had a sale on their drinks. I was all in, we decided to order bacon and eggs. Their jalapeno bacon, best decision I made when we were there. I would recommend the restaurant to anyone who wants a fairly quick breakfast with a drink."}
{"text":"Worst experience we have ever had. The so called \"General Manager\" needs to get reevaluated. She is rude, unethical and disrespectful. She has absolutely no patience for customers, and stands around doing absolutely nothing to help her staff attend tables. She stands around talking about her customers and should not be working at a restaurant. In the little time we were there we had to ask for refills every single time when we asked her why our food was taking so long and once it finally came out... why was it cold she stated that the reason being was that they had a bigger party that they were attending... still does not justify why all your other customers will get bad service if you are not fit to attend such a big party you need to reconsider your staff and arrange it properly so that it can be easily managed.  This place shouldn't even be opened and its a disgrace to be a denny's chain... I will be filing a complaint with. Corporate as well!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you have to just go back to the neighborhood restaurants. Went here for breakfast, and the food was great. The price is great too. Now I can buy off the senior menu. It's pretty awesome. Plus with my AARP card I get 15% off. I had bacon, sausage, cheddar cheese eggs, and pancakes for $5.73, and it was delicious. I would have given 5 stars but the bacon is a little thin and small. Also, we got two slices of pumpkin pie to go. We tried to eat it after we got home--it was awful. We took one bite and threw it out. This is saying something because I love pie. LOL"}
{"text":"We ordered two grand slam breakfasts. The bacon was practically raw. We called the server over and asked if we can get new bacon cooked longer. There was a station next to our table it's dirty silverware and dishwater. The server cleared off a dirty dish, placed a napkin in it and asked for the bacon on both my husbands and I plate. She came back 10 minutes later with the same exact bacon we gave her. Disgusting and unsaitary ! NEVER AGAIN !"}
{"text":"Dennys has changed their delicious chicken fried steak to a formed meat product brick  EPIC FAIL!!!!!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT order take-out! They can never get the order correct and over charge. I got charged 4 dollars for pancakes that I never received. Very disappointing. Also very bad costumer service. Even called to speak to manager and she said she can't do anything since they didn't see the mistake. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yes you can have alcohol in the morning! There is no time stop in Vegas. If it's your evening but really it's morning they still have alcohol specials. It was my birthday and we got great service. Food was fast. The downside was it took almost as long to pay as it did to sit and eat. I felt bad for customers trying to eat as the line went through the restaurant. Other than that everything went great."}
{"text":"Very understaffed for night shift. Corporate needs to get the scheduling figured out."}
{"text":"Always pleasant staff and quick wait times at this location. If you're looking for a quick inexpensive smack at any hour f the day I'd definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"This Denny's needs to seriously re-think their customer service model.  They have one, I repeat one, hostess/cashier/phone attendent attempting to function as a cashier, answer phone calls/take to-go orders, seat customers, and deal with a customer complaints.  It caused a great amount of distress in the lobby and did NOT create a welcoming environment.  However, our server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Saturday around 3 pm we stopped in for lunch no service for 20 minutes nothing at all! The server didn't care she actually shrugged her shoulders AWFUL! We walked out!"}
{"text":"Went into Denny's on 8/11 to have a nice family dinner. My son ordered the make your own pancakes with white chocolate chips, strawberries, banana's and whipped cream. My parents ordered the make your own grand slam and I got the avocado chicken salad. The restaurant was sort of clean, the floors were dirty under the tables, cobwebs hanging from the fake plants along the ceiling and on the shutters. Not to mention you could make a nice hat from the dust in the laddies bathroom.   My son got food poisoning from the whipped cream. The avocado on my salad were so rubbery it was like a fake food prop.  1/3 of the salad was old yellow romaine lettuce. The meat on my parents' plates was undercooked, my mom asked for egg beaters (fake eggs) got egg whites, waitress never told her they didn't have \"Egg Beaters\". Parents wanted to change their meat, and the waitress went to the kitchen window and \"told on\" on them, instead of telling the cook she mis-ordered items for them. An experience I hope never to repeat!! Dine at Denny's at your own expense!"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for no star. After getting seated quickly, it took 15 mins before some came to take our order. Now, we came because we thought it would be quick since we were time crunched to get my nephew to his baseball game, however it took another 45 minutes to get our food. The server felt so bad about it that she brought us a bowl of fruit while we waited. We told her we had to hurry, so she started bringing our food our as it came up. She was very apologetic even saying, I know they messed up your order, but I'll bring it out the other stuff as soon as it's ready. The manager came by and said sorry, but it was backed up because there were 3 large parties like us. We had 6 people. Really...18 people sets the whole place to an hour long delay for wrong food? If you are gonna lie, please come up with a better lie than that. We are done coming here, even the to go box came out broken...just like my patience. This location is off the list permanently."}
{"text":"I order steak and eggs. The steak is suppose to be medium. It was so tough you had to cut it with a chain saw! Hecka tough! Than I paid $20.51 and I gave her $21.00. She didn't give back the change. I don't care about the 50 cents! But you can't assume! Ask! You have this African American waiter serving so many tables. He was very sweet and nice! But he is rushing! Have more waitress or waiter! This will be my last check in!"}
{"text":"Worst service and ice cold food.  Nobody around.  I'll never come back.  You should be ashamed of yourself"}
{"text":"A plus is that is it is open 24 hours a day. The food is alright but satisfies a late night craving. I recently had the birthday cake milkshake, which was good. It was not the best milkshake I have ever had, but it was not bad. My friends had the veggie skillets, which they both enjoyed. Their prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"We came late on a Saturday night and the experience was just terrible. After we ordered, we waited about an hour for our food. Two of the orders were just pie, which could have be done relatively quick since they are premade. None of our orders were even that complicated, just some appetizers and desserts.   Then when our food came, two of the people's orders were not even complete. They said that the apple crisp that my friend ordered was burnt and was not salvageable, so she had to order something else. My friend ordered a hot chocolate and found huge clumps of powder at the bottom of her mug. They could not even stir the hot chocolate. We split jalepeno bottle caps and mozzarella sticks which were fine nothing special very greasy. They also never refilled our water.   It says it is a 24 hour place, but it seems that the service is just terrible after midnight. Very disappointed and do not recommend."}
{"text":"My  husband and I love the food here, I especially, am in love with the pancakes. We eat here often.  My only critique is the bathroom.. the outside bottoms of the toilet bowls need to be cleaned.  These bathrooms, were just redone and looked so good after. BUT if they do not keep 'em clean, they will  get in the same \"kind of just about terrible\" way, they were before they were redone."}
{"text":"Service was really great. Small blond lady was soooo nice! Food was disgusting. Veggie burger was horrible. Seasoned fries were also very terrible... even for a drunk 2am snack."}
{"text":"Went to Dennys with my Uncle in the evening and the morning.  Anne served us in the evening, she was so kind, her service was perfect.  Daniel served us in the evening, his service topped all Dennys restaurants I've ever been to. Actively asking us if we needed anything, he filled our drinks, joked around, and provided a welcoming experience. This Dennys definitely has the best service I've ever seen, ever, period.  Even the waitresses here have excellent service, and good attitude. This place is a definite comeback when I visit Vegas.  Many thanks to Anne and Daniel for their great work."}
{"text":"Came in at around 6am. There were tables open all thru out the restaurant. But my party and another party had to wait. A Security guard calls into the servers how many people need tables. Weird, i guess alot of people try to dine and dash, which is what happened when we were trying to be seated. And thats what the hold up was. Didnt seem like alot of servers at that time of the morning but more seemed to show up. Being a Sunday morning you would think they would have more people on at that time of day, since club heads and concert goers are usually funneling in somewhere to eat before hitting the hotel room and bed.   Once seated it was a good experience. The Server was friendly and quick. Great communication on where your food was with coming to the table. Always kept the drinks filled to. Also look in those guides on the strip and they have a 20% off Coupon for the total check. I used it and they didnt give me a hassle.   The mens room was dirty but i let the manager know and they got someone on it pretty quickly. All in All will i be back? Most Definitely"}
{"text":"Great Food and customer service, it could've smelled a litte nicer but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This Denny's is a little out dated, but service and food is what you come to expect. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here. The waitress took our order, we ordered milkshakes, pancakes, etc. After a while our appetizer came, we still didn't have silverware but we didn't need it yet so we let it slide. Our food came finally, and she said she would bring us forks. Ten minutes passed and we still didn't have forks, or milkshakes. It finally got to the point that my boyfriend has to get up, return a plate of food that was made wrong to another employee, and grab his own silverware. She never came back to the table again after dropping the food. A manager came by asking how our food was and we had to ask for the milkshakes to be made to go whenever they were finally made because everyone was done eating and ready to leave. We didn't even receive an apology for waiting with food in front of us for ten minutes with no way of eating it. Never got our waters refilled. Terrible terrible terrible service."}
{"text":"Busy and slightly understaffed, the the manager more than made up for it. We  celebrated a friend's birthday at Hot and Juicy Crawfish and were looking for a 'less fishy' place to sing happy bday and maybe have some good coffee. We stopped at a few places and they were either closed or full, so we ventured into Denny's to see if we could bring the cake in and have some coffee- great coffee BTW. Although clearly busy and short-staffed, the manager was very pleasant and welcomed us into the restaurant. Her smile and customer service oriented demeanor earned her and the staff 5 stars. I wish I could remember her name, but for the record she was working 11/24 at about 10pm.  I normally do not review chain restaurants, as there is not much of an experience to talk about. However, I ALWAYS compliment great service and that is why I am taking the time to write in."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Huntington Beach. I used to hate Dennys, but OMG, I love it. Whatever changes they did, they did right!! And they have A+ customer service. .. we love Santos!!!!! This is the Dennys on Beach Blvd and Ellis, in Huntington Beach."}
{"text":"Never been to this location before and thought I would pop in for Sunday brunch with my mom. The table they placed us at was out of the way which I enjoyed, but there was a terrible glare through the window and they wouldn't bring the blinds down which was sad. It was also a very long wait from being seated to ordering (almost 30 mins) but I suppose they were busy. My mother ordered a steak and eggs breakfast and I had the Santa Fe scrambler. Her steak was ordered medium but arrived well done, and there was a very large group nearby us so she decided not to wait the time to send it back. My scrambler came without the bell peppers which made the texture very bland. Both meals were disappointing, but the service once it arrived was worth a second chance sometime."}
{"text":"Ordered online and is been 4hours and i got nothing. I have tried calling the restaurant and they blame the driver and they just don't care they said they just cooked the food and they are not responsible for anything else. I feel very upset right now. Bye bye Dennys you just lost another customer and i will make sure i pass this on to my family, friends and coworkers. This is a terrible way to do business."}
{"text":"This is probably my second time at a Denny's ever. A friend and I came here for food after having a late night adventure around town. People always tell me that Denny's is just cheap diner food, but nothing was really open in the area that sparked our interest so we decided that Denny's will do. I know I shouldn't expect much because it's not fine dining, but here it goes...  When we first arrived, we weren't even greeted and two employees glanced right at us and continued their conversation. I don't like interrupting people (and I know they acknowledged our presence because they glanced at us) so we just waited until they stopped. We were seated shortly after their conversation ended and were greeted by what seemed to be the only person working the front end. This guy was friendly, but service was slow for a night that wasn't busy (there were a total of two tables dining in, including our table). I ordered the fish & chips.  The fish & chips are white fish fillets fried to a crispy golden brown served with fries and a side order of your choice (I went with their steamed broccoli). It was good for something from a chain diner, but it wasn't anything that I would rave about.  Service was basically non-existent because our waiter didn't show up through our whole meal except when we were almost done. He made a snarky comment  after he noticed we grabbed a ketchup bottle from the empty table next to us, since the one on our table ran out and we were almost done with our meal. Like I said, the service wasn't there and it wasn't until we were getting ready to leave and pay for our food that the waiter starts having these long conversations about his past, and at the end of the night we just wanted to go home (we wouldn't have minded if he talked to us during our meal, but we literally were done and paid for and it was kinda awkward for us to end the conversation).   Here's the bottom line: come here at 1 in the morning if you want to hear oldies music while Law & Order SVU is playing on their TVs on mute, and at the same time you can hear the employees having inappropriate conversations in the kitchen. I'm not gonna lie, it definitely was a unique experience to say the least but I don't think I'll go back. Maybe it would've been a better experience during the day, but then again it's just a Denny's..."}
{"text":"So we just arrived at here and we sat for 8min before someone come over to take our drink order. But when someone did it was another waitress name Linda who was so sweet and nice. Our original waitress showed her face about 5min after that. Needless to say linda will be getting the tip."}
{"text":"Always good food and coffee. It's never loud, music softly fades in background, yet it is loud enough for others not to hear your conversation. I like their coffee, it is simple regular coffee - consistent good. Comfortable clean tables, cheap prices, friendly staff.   It may feel like a dinner, because it is"}
{"text":"The food came very slowly and the service was very slow it took forever for our meal to come and when people came after us they got to eat before us food came out it was ok food tasted all rights but the service was very very very bad using the service isn't that bad out here but for me I didn't get that kind of service.   The table behind us had 8 people at their table.and we only had 4 but there food came out in a fraction of the time it took for our food to come. It seemed like everyone was getting fast service beside us and they only had one server in our area. All in all a very horrible experience  they did take 10% off the bill for being so slow."}
{"text":"Nachos had cold cheese and when asked how food was I informed them the nachos weren't good, and the MANAGER replied that's how they are made here! Her name is Valentina and she is a real bitch!"}
{"text":"I know, I know, it's Denny's. With that said, this Denny's outperformed ANY Denny's I have ever visited!! It was Father's Day and although Daddy had a different venue in mind, the kid LOVES Denny's (he likes the special kid stuff they offer) and he was super excited to go to Denny's on Father's Day (his specific request!). Daddy being the awesome Daddy that he is agreed to go to Denny's.   It was VERY BUSY with a long wait, but the wait went FAST!! They were hustling big time!!! Our food came out in a matter of minutes!! I was WOWED with how quickly our food came out, yet it was cooked PERFECTLY!! Kudos to the cook and to our server, Delaney as well!! Our server was quick, confident and efficient!! Even though she was EXTREMELY BUSY and we had several special requests, we felt like we were her only guests!!   God job Denny's (good cooks and good server, Delaney, as well as the entire front staff)!!! We enjoyed our experience today!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant their morning crew is outstanding excellent service , nice and clean presentation . Keep up the good work Denny's crew !!"}
{"text":"GHETTO! It was so nasty in here to start with.  A homeless left to sleep on a bench INSIDE the restaurant.  Who allows that? Then we get seated and no one comes to bring us any drinks or take our order for over 15 minutes.  Then 2 other tables get seated after us and they were waited on and we still sat there with no service.  We were the only white people in the place so maybe that is why idk? My husband said that we would wait another 5 minutes and if no one comes then we leave.  Of course no one comes so we go to leave and on our way out we speak to the oriental lady at the counter and tell her what happened and she could care less so then we ask for the manager.  He comes out and could give a care less too.  He took his time to come out and had nothing to say about our complaints. No sorry?? Really???  No offer for us to sit back down and get service?? What kind of manager sits in the back room doing nothing to run the place and lets homeless sleep on a bench inside the place. Not outside, inside the place? Would not recommend this place ever and makes me never want to go to another Denny's ever.  Putrid place!"}
{"text":"The worst Denny's in town that I have been to.  We walked in there was no one to greet us or anything. The employees were all at the corner hanging out by the kitchens door. Our waiter couldn't even do a head count. Basically she suck. Worst waitress ever. She had no clue of what she's doing. She doesn't even know anything about the menu. My friend wanted a chicken wrap, she told him they don't have that. I was ordering and I wanted the build your own short stack with the eggs and stuff. She didn't even let me finish what I wanted to order. My food came I wondered where was my eggs bacon and hash brown. Her ass didn't even write it down or whatever. She then gave my friends each others plates. My friend was like this is a burrito. The waitress responded well that's what they gave me. Freaking idiot gave my friend who ordered the burrito my other friends chicken wrap. The waitress upset me. Erghhh. She then gave my friend a diet coke which he ordered a regular coke. Oh yeah. She didnt gave us any fork knives and napkins. How am I suppose to eat my damn pancakes. This isn't a pancake eating contest. We were all done she put the receipt on the table and told us the check is on the table. Every time time she came to our table she kept telling us the check is on the table. I find that rude. I swear she was on drugs. The manager lady was cool but she didn't help us. If you do decide to eat here try to get the Hispanic lady. She's really helpful and has been there a long time from what she told us. PEOPLE PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS DENNY'S. If you want to go to Denny's drive a couple blocks to the one on Dectaur and Tropicana. They give better service. I wanted to add you can smell cigarettes from the casino. Not a good place to bring your children."}
{"text":"Had a hour to kill before work this morning, This Denny's was the closest. Should of considered McDee's. On this occasion the food was actually passible...it was the server which was the problem..I don't speak Spanish, she made a feeble attempt at English. Needed to repeat my order 6 times..when the order arrived wrong and toast was cold..Asked for coffee, she brought tea..Finally became convinced she wanted me to eat what she thought I should have....Not interested in what I wanted. Saving grace was manager came over. I detailed what went aray and comp'ed the meal...will I go back, don't think so...Dennys is a bad part of town..keep an eye on your wallet and your car.................."}
{"text":"Usually have good food and service.  Not today.  Waiter had the personality of a turd.  I did not feel welcome at any point.  Food was horrible hash browns were completely soaked in grease and barely browned.  My over medium eggs were runny and snotty raw.  The country fried steak had a funny taste and the butter wasnt even melted on the toast."}

{"text":"The last time my wife and I were at this Denny's location the experience was sub-par at best.  The food was blah the service was blah and the price of everything was really high for what you got.  That was about 2-3 years ago and we have not been back.    Today, my wife and I decided to use a coupon we got from one of those school coupon books and I can say that we were not real thrilled to go.  However, we decided to try things again.  Man, were we surprised!!!!  There was a complete 180 degree turnaround from before!!!  The service was fantastic and the food was delicious!!  Norma was our server and she did a fantastic job!  She brought us our coffees right away and gave us a chance to look at our menus.  From there she always made sure we were happy and kept our drinks filled!  The prices also appear to have changed and have become more reasonable.  I have to say that we will definitely be back.  I applaud the changes that have been made and I highly recommend locals to check this place out again!!  You will not be sorry!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Standard Denny's fare.  SLOOOOOW SERVICE.  I came in at 4:30 am and a lot of people sitting around with no food, tables sitting with dirty plates and glasses. The bar was filthy too.  Clearly understaffed.  A woman came in finally and they started to catch up.   I got my food a little after 5:00 so that sucked.    24 hours should mean you can expect at least some minimum level of service.    Otherwise the place was just Denny's."}
{"text":"Really nice Denny's in a great area of Vegas. I stopped here  for cookies  and cream sundae!!! I noticed their is plenty of shopping around here. Staff are great and friendly. 2-4-6-8 menu is an excellent value choice. Alicia, my server could not have been better."}
{"text":"This Denny's is cleaner than a lot of other ones. There is a red box in front of it! Yay :) Its great for carefree highway lol"}
{"text":"We had eaten earlier at a shmancy sushi spot at the Palms. I guess it holds true also with Japanese food regarding being hungry again in an hour.   We were suppose to go to BB Kings for a late nite snack, cocktails and blues, but, our hunger (and drunkenness) just would not be satisfied with anything other than good ol american diner fare. Enter, Denny's.   We slowed our roll from the alcohol with a glass of Diet Coke and Rasberry Iced Tea. Just thinking about that first sip makes my mouth water. That and I drank two glasses before even ordering. Damn desert dehydration!   Mama ordered the super bird with a side salad and I got some flavor of the month Jalapeno cheese burger with onions that Ozomatley or Los Lobos or the Beatles order. Whoever sponsors it, it was scrumptious! Oh mylanta that damn burger was the $hit I tell you! THE $HIT!!! We split a side of onion rings and french fries. We both voraciously annihilated our food like it was going out of style. I felt the plate shaking in fear that it would have been the next item down our throats.   Man, I have to say that was one of the best Denny's episodes we've ever had. Sigh...."}
{"text":"We loved visiting this Denny's!  We were staying at the Tahiti Resort next door and were craving some good old down home cooking--so naturally Denny's was first choice.   We were seated right away and already knew what we wanted to order.  We had a party of 3 and ordered 2 meals to share, which is perfect for our little group.  We enjoyed the philly steak and cheese omelet with hashbrowns and our choice of toast.  We chose the sourdough and it was delicious with the jam!  We also ordered the good old stand-by, \"Super Bird\" turkey, bacon, cheese and tomato on toast.  We had french fries on the side of this meal.  We split the meals up and had a few bites of everything.  I love to do this type of \"sampling\" with my favorite people....my family!    The meal only cost us $21 plus a tip.  When we arrived at 6pm, it was an empty restaurant.  When we left at 7pm, they had a packed house! Waay to go Denny's.  See you tomorrow for breakfast :)  Tips and Hints.....Get the hot chocolate!  Free refills for warm bodies and toes. Get the apple crisp alamode...Drizzled in caramel topped with icecream!  My fave :)"}
{"text":"We stopped by to try the super slam breakfast meal.  The restaurant was a bit empty and we were seated quickly.  Our server, Chuck was very attentive.  Now, we came to this Denny's because others closer to us are horrible and we wanted to try a new one.  The food arrived very quickly and I must admit the food was really good.  Eggs were seasoned, no need for salt.  The pancakes were so good that my children told me they were better than mine ad they were even better than IHOP (no exaggeration).  They has browns could have been cooked more but that is a preference issue.  When it's good, you have to say it's good and it was good.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I should have known this was not a good place because the parking lot was empty, but my phone was dead and I could not check in to Yelp - MISTAKE #1.  First off the place was freezing, no heat what so ever!  My kids were freezing and we had our coats on.  We ordered nachos for an appetizer but they had NO queso. So we skipped that.  I ordered a cup of soup and hot tea because it was so cold.  I even asked for that the soup be scalding hot.  Of course the put soup into a cold cup and with the temperature so cold in there it was not even room temperature so into the microwave it had to go. The tea water was not even hot enough but just took it.  I ordered the skillet meal with the chicken sausage.  Guess. What, no chicken sausage either.  This was the worst place we could have gone to.  Keep driving by, but this was an awful experience and they will never see my family again.  Just a side note, the waitress did her best under the circumstances.  I echo another helper, this place is NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STAR, but that is the lowest rating we can give."}
{"text":"This is built on top of what used to be a pet cemetery.  I think of the cats and dogs of old when I eat here.  Kind of like a Rainbow Bridge Denny's."}
{"text":"Meh! They only had one waiter working at 5:30 in the afternoon, which I thought was strange, it's dinner time isn't it? Two stars for service, but the food was good. My burger was cooked just right."}
{"text":"\"How did I even end up here? Why is my life so weird? How is it that I keep finding myself in random places? I guess I should just accept that my life will be a continual stretch of strange oddities that may make sense eventually down the road. What did I order again?\", questioned this peculiar guy looking out at the Las Vegas strip. He just sat there pondering by the windows within this Denny's located a story above ground level. As his coffee arrived, he now had more fuel in the form of caffeine to come up with more nonsensical musings. What then interrupted his thoughts was the placing of a platter of breakfast stuffs atop the advertisement filled placemat in front of him. He discerned that the food was actually a small step better than at most Denny's though the service was a fair bit more subpar. After having multiple refills of the dark liquid and clearing his plate of edibles, this one customer paid his bill, left a rather average tip, and was never seen again at this establishment. Only his legend remains to be shared throughout the generations of time."}
{"text":"Dennys is an institution of late night. I don't need to review the food. You go because you love to savor that greasy sunny side up egg at midnight. You go to hang out, linger, and not get rushed out. You go for a cheap, reliable meal. You go because...why not? Everyone should experience a late night Dennys at least once. This was a weekly favorite for me in high school. My palate has evolved since then, but I tell you, Dennys is still giddy fun."}
{"text":"This location is the absolute worst. We ordered and saw three families who came in after us get their food before we did. When we finally got our food my wife's food was ice cold and my toast was only half toasted. Literally one side of the bread wasn't toasted at all. The management is rude, and the wait staff is incompetent. This location needs a major staffing change."}
{"text":"This is a North American diner, not a high end restaurant. And we got great service from an attentive waitress (Sherry L is awesome), hot delicious food and excellent value.   The booths at this location are super comfortable. The natural lighting and large windows was appreciated and despite a shouting match between two patrons and a woman screaming at her nine-year-old telling him he was acting like a four-year-old... all which I considered free entertainment for the night ... The ambiance was relaxed.  They have a value menu on weekdays, which in Canada translates to items for $4,$6,$8 & $10. We ordered a chocolate milkshake to share and without asking Sherry kindly split them in the kitchen and brought us two individual shakes. Both were cold, creamy & delicious.   The potato chicken skillet was hot and tasty, the pancake puppies were sugar cinnamon sweet. Yes it was frozen broccoli that they used in the skillet, but come on we know we're at Denny's! Embrace it. You only live once!!   Highlights were the bottomless (free refills) lemonade, and country fried steak with 2 eggs, sourdough buttered toast and crispy shredded hashbrowns. Plus Sherry gave me Tabasco when I asked for it! Bless you Denny's."}
{"text":"We went to Denny's 2 nights in a row. Both nights max was our server. He has the best customer service and does a awesome job! He was so nice and friendly! The food was great too!"}
{"text":"So again, try to give this place a try again and what do you know, server says we have chicken sausage patties, instead of turkey sauasage patties. I say okay.  She comes back out and says oh, it has been discontinued and we have gouda apple chicken sausage.  My face- priceless, yet still nice and professional. The waitress says, no 1 knee it was dicontinued until now??? Interesting.. So I'm like what's the wiifm? She says I'll speak to the manager. This guy, not good english comes out with the menu like I can't read or incompetent and starts pointing! I had to politely advise him, I am very competent and can read and advised him, your employees need to be trained properly if things are discontinued and still being offered. So this is it- the manager was horrible, not understanding the common language of America. NEGATIVE 100 RATING!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a big group of people (~15) at around 10p on a Thursday night. We had just finished running with MIP, and were super famished and thirsty.   Can't remember the server's name but I would say he and the rest of the staff were very accommodating by putting together tables for us and taking our orders by whose bills were together. The food is what I would imagine a typical diner would be-- not quite the greatest culinary experience of my life, but cheap as heck and open 24/7. I had a Tuscany Superbird, which I suppose was a new addition? The bread was a tad too toasted for me and hurt to bite into lol, but overall not bad especially with a side of seasoned fries! At any other Denny's visit, I usually opt for the $2, $4, $6, $8 menu, but I was feeling \"adventurous\" lol."}
{"text":"Came in on Christmas Day and this was probably the best experience I've ever had at any Denny's. Everyone here greeted us with a big smile and our server, Dom, took great care of us. The good vibes he sent was amazing. Will definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service, had a prepaid order, had me sitting there for half an hour, only to come back and say, \"you ordered it here?\" Double checked, indeed this was the case, it was ordered at this location. Asked to speak to the manager, who couldn't be bothered with a customer order, she just didn't care. The manager needs some serious retraining."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, one couple and a single man were there in the whole restaurant. Sat for 5 minutes. The other couple waited and waited for their coffee and water which never came. We walked out. Passed the server who was standing at the front and she said, 'I was on my way'. Never will go there again."}
{"text":"Service wt these Dennys restaurants keep getting worse and worse. We were seated promptly and after we got our drinks the waitress didappeared for 15 mins. It took 45 mins to get our food."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Denny's I have been to in my life. Now I should expect low quality just based off the location which is inside one of the most ghetto casinos in Las Vegas. But ghetto aside you as a customer have to expect a certain level of quality even considering its Denny's. I ordered a chicken avocado Caesar salad and a cup of bold coffee. Now she had to make a fresh pot of bold and instead of serving it to me, the waitress brought the coffee to the wrong table and said I made this special bold blend just for you. She passed me and didn't think twice multiple times. There was no more than 5 total tables in the place and the workers literally act like you just appeared out of the air and like they never spoke to you before. Everyone walks around like they are new and the management needs to train these people how to attempt and look at customers needs while paying attention to empty glasses and the basic things. Overall I wouldn't give this place a second try and all the employees need to lose there jobs."}
{"text":"The restaurant was only 25% full. We ordered and 45 mins later still no food. The the cooks working the kitchen were completely incompetent. The waitresses had to keep correcting them and all their orders were screwed up. Tables only got half their orders and things were missing. We were about to get up and walk out when the food finally came and it was cold and unedible.  One person at my table didnt get his order and it turns out they forgot to put it in. This location needs to gets its act together. Perhaps hiring cooks that actually know how to cook and speak English would be a start."}
{"text":"Staff was nice but they had only ONE waitress working the entire restaurant during the morning breakfast rush.   Entire place was DIRTY. The counter and tables had dirty dishes/napkins on them. The floor had crumbs completely all over it. The back area was worse. Food and crumbs covering the counters and floor. Just nasty."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is a great deal and new pancake recipe tastes awesome! Service is also very friendly. Sometimes a wait on weekends but not bad:)"}
{"text":"Very sweet server, left her a tip and don't regret it not one bit.  However management needs to rectify the kitchen situation and not depend solely on a senior server to keep the peace.  We arrived at 11am got our food 50 minutes later, me and my son watched an episode of boss baby.  We never got a second order of pancakes or fruit cup and had to wait 20 minutes for the first order of pancakes after letting our server know they didn't bring them out.  Bless her heart.  Could be a great place, it looks nice, they rep Star Wars but the kitchen situation needs prayer and the servers need to be more attentive and the manager needs to be more involved.    If I go back it'll be to see the server, and it'll be late night with the boys.  This establishment definitely isn't ready for serious families with high standards, more like a late night with the boys because there will be plenty of time to talk and cut up while you wait for your meal."}
{"text":"I really love coming here.   The staff are super friendly and the relaxed atmosphere is perfect for a nice meal with friends or family.   I also really enjoy the food and the service is great as well.   This is definitely one of my favourite places to eat."}
{"text":"Jack had the best service I have ever had at a Denny's! He's great at his job and he's the reason this place received the five stars! Not the food but the service!"}
{"text":"It's Denny's. It has food. It's really cheap if you order off the $2/$4/$6 menu.  I wouldn't recommend it, although the service was fine, but then again, getting eight people to agree on anything that early when they're hungover leads to some Denny's  type experiences.  So go, just know it'll be just like the last time you went to Denny's."}
{"text":"My parents had a coupon and treated the kids and I to breakfast. The server was friendly but with so many tables to wait on she had trouble attending to us. The hostess was unfriendly. The food was standard diner fare, but it took nearly 45 minutes to get to us even though the restaurant was half full. The hobbit hole breakfast was a bit disappointing as the hearty sausage that you pay extra for was void of flavor. The line at the cashier to pay was also annoyingly lengthy. This place wouldn't be bad if they added more staff."}
{"text":"Denny's with more parking than the one on the strip. Service is still horrible, a standard Denny's signature service marker. Nothing else really different, other than the fact that you're in Las Vegas and probably need to sober up before your long drive home. It gets the job done as you would expect."}
{"text":"Nice service and great, fast food. Was a great experience overall.. I liked the salad with avocado and chicken!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here a few days ago. From the point of entry our waiter showed us seating. From the drinks with lil to no ice and the most unorganized order taking skills. It just spiraled out of control from there.  Family of 5 plates were not ready at the same time and when my 5 year old received his eggs the egg were very raw( not fully cooked) our waiter was so horrible it was a slow time it was  completely not busy but she seemed not to attend or deliver very unorganized and did not know how to prioritize her service.  I asked her for her manager and from there I was revived from just walking out. My complaints were legitimate clear as day. I explained everything calmly and respectfully and He apologized stating the gal was new. Also he gave a generous discount. Really great manager that values customers. I will return here but if gal in braces and glasses is my server I will respectfully decline her."}
{"text":"One star off for the styrofoam boxes, but otherwise this Denny's gets four stars for the woman who came over with a camera and offered to take a photo of us for a Denny's themed keepsake postcard and...promptly came back with, what do ya know, a Denny's themed keepsake postcard. This might have been the greatest dine in experience I've ever had"}
{"text":"Ok, I'll admit that Denny's is not even on my radar when it comes to hitting up a place for breakfast. However, walking into this particular Denny's in Arizona had some mitigating factors:  1. We were near Avondale, AZ because we were attending the NASCAR race; we left Scottsdale hecka early, anticipating Sonoma Raceway-like gnarled traffic, which did not materialize so we had time to kill and we were all hungry, so the search for breakfast began.  2. We were gonna hit up Cracker Barrel, but the lines were out the door, so we opted for this Denny's across the street. Plus, our group being, er, frugal, we knew Denny's would be a less expensive option.  Now, no lines out the door when we got there, and it was only a 10-minute wait for our party of four, so that was cool. Our waitress, Isabel, was quick, courteous, friendly, and efficient. She was at our table quickly, brought out all our drinks quickly, kept our drinks refilled, and brought us the check quickly. She got an extra $2 from me, because breakfast waitresses are woefully undertipped!  They were certainly turning and burning the tables in there; our food was ready in like eight minutes! The food was fine; it's Denny's!  By the time we left Denny's, it was packed and there was definitely a line out the door! We made it in time to beat the NASCAR and after-church crowds. So, we basically carbo-loaded for our long day at Phoenix International Raceway. A good time was had by all :)"}
{"text":"When we are in the mood for some good ole diner food we come here. Yes, it is an older Denny's but don't let it fool you. The service and food are good. Angela is our favorite waitress and she is the sweetest person you will ever meet. Make sure to ask to be seated in her section."}
{"text":"This Denny's is on point today. Really good service, food done right, good atmosphere.... Ok some of the bench seats have seen better days, but I guess they do get a lot of use  however, I'm willing to forgive that for now, because the food and service more than made up for it.     Update:  This place is so awesome. Here agaaaain"}
{"text":"The servers at this Dennys are always absolutely incredible, and never disappoint. Ryder, Michael and Jacob are all very sweet guys! The food here is good and the restaurant is always clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Breakfast early this am, going to the range to do some shooting and it's not open until 7am, but today I needed fasting lab work and we went 5am to get it done and this was our next stop, breakfast.  You build your own glam slam and if you are good you can stick with the low carb version.  Of course if you want pancakes they got that too, but eggs scrambled with s a side of bacon and sausage is perfect for me.  Good service, quick, clean place, not much of a crowd at this time of morning."}
{"text":"Now a days, you can build your own grand slam.  When my husband and I want to eat breakfast out and are trying to stick to a low carb diet, we'll often try it here.  Picking out four items to add to eggs made your way, makes it easy for us. At this location, the food is good, the service is good and the price is even better."}
{"text":"Menu so big it's overwhelming.   My eggs were cold. Brenda's eggs had eggshells in them. Our server was incredibly quick to bring condiments, to-go waters, and drinks, though.  This Denny's was huge and clean with lots of natural light. The wait time was 20 min at 11:30 a.m. on a Friday for a party of 5. This was amazing considering there were about 15 names ahead of our party on the list.   Gluten free options include English muffins and nachos.  Total Vegas style, there was a cash bar in the waiting area. Both outside and inside, there were 2 for 1 mimosas and bloody marys all day. One mimosa is $9, so $4.50 each. This is CHEAP for Vegas where most cocktails are $14 or more. They were small but heavy on the champagne.    My advice? Go get drunk on those before the clubs if you don't want to pre-game in the hotel.   Seriously, though, don't order food. Just drinks."}
{"text":"For this being a Denny's I was really taken by surprise. They was so far above my expectations that words do not convey how happy I was with the service and food. Thank you every one at this Denny's you got it right all the way around. Service, smiles and not burned coffee I was totally and happily surprised."}
{"text":"Good place for a cheap lunch. WICKED CROWDED. Get there early. Typical sit down fast food like IHOP, Dave's etc. A little on the dirty side, but it is close to Casino Royale and Imperial Palace (gross), so I would expect no less.  The wait staff are WAY over-worked, and their \" get them in and out attitude \" is disappointing.  Tip them well !! They bust their asses though.   **** The food was really tasty, and it came quickly. I had the nachos. This was a leap of faith because the last time I ate at Denny's (1989) there was a very long black hair in my food(nachos) no hair this time, yet I think the nachos still tasted the same."}
{"text":"This is the standard late night eatery or diner that we all know and love.  This restaurant is located across from the Mirage Hotel and Casino and next to the Venetian Hotel and Casino.  It was after the late night show at the Mirage and we wanted to eat something small.  All the other fast food type restaurants were closed or closing....and we did not want to walk far.  HELLO.....there was Denny's and it was not crowded.  BOOM.....I ordered hash browns with brown gravy, onions, and cheese....(oh yeah.....don't forget to make it greasy good!)  It is the old reliable Denny's restaurant in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip.  It is slightly more expensive than other Denny's restaurants, but it is in the middle of the strip where their rent is surely elevated.  :-p"}
{"text":"Horrible food experience - the waitress was awesome they had her over staffed - tables dirty - the guy ringing me up and asked how the food was and I said terrible and he said oh ok rather then actually taking time to ask why or anything ! Food was cold got the new leche pancakes was missing Carmel sauce !! My eggs were cold and so was my has browns and my sons toast hard!!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast.   Fast and friendly!  We were eating breakfast and we noticed how hard all the employees were working.  We could over hear the employees talking and they were polite to each other.  It was really nice to see.  Our server was great.  A little slow towards the end because she got a large group, but otherwise all good."}
{"text":"Worst Dennys I've been to the food was horrible.  My order was incomplete.   Everything was not done properly.  I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I went against my better judgement and came here for breakfast. We had a short wait time and got seated. I have one star for that and then one more star for the person who makes the balloon animals for kids. Other than that, everything sucked.   Took about 25 minutes for our food to come out when it did, it was not hot so it had obviously been sitting waiting to be served. Our waitress did not come by to refill my daughters drink, didn't bring napkins and didn't even check how the food was. The next time we saw her, she was bringing the check.   There are way too many other options of places to eat breakfast in the area and this Denny's will not get my business again."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Table was dirty the previous customers papers were under the table. Both our orders were wrong. When I went to check out she didn't say when to swipe my card so I did it to soon and she announced it was declined in which it wasn't... the bathrooms are filthy can't even use the first stall it's clogged with toilet paper and the trash is over filling."}
{"text":"Sometimes a Yelp review isn't just about the food. Dining at a restaurant sometimes means more than just a good meal but a tradition that is more meaningful than one could express.  My family has been spending Sunday breakfast here for years. Each time, they request to sit in Christina's section. She remembers everyone's usual order right down to my Uncle's skillet without mushrooms. When I come home to visit my family she even remembers my usual \"Moons\" order! She's prompt, friendly and always greets us with a smile and even hugs my grandma. She doesn't seem to mind us lingering a while after we eat to visit with each other too, though we do try to free her tables up asap.   I can't express how much Christina means to not just my family but me. Since I no longer live in Vegas it's nice to know that she brings comfort to my loved ones. Sunday breakfast wouldn't be the same without her.   If you stop in, ask for her section. There's no doubt you'll be taken care of. Really though, everyone here is really great. Thank you Christina! I really appreciate your hard work and your kind heart. You're a lovely woman inside and out!"}
{"text":"We were a party of five. Really great experience. My mother-in-law got her Dennys usual \"Moon over my hammy\" ; wife, a club, w/ the broccoli cheese soup, & fresh fruit ; daughter, a dinner salad, and very ample order of seasoned fries; grandson a child's menu chicken meal ; a I ordered the chicken fried steak from the 55+ list (very filling portions for a 7.99 price). All the food was hot tasty and arrived in reasonable time. But the star of our visit was a very good waitress we've had before, Marley. She's always cheerful, attentive to check back, and reliable to bring the requested extras (extra dressing, hot sauce, more napkins, etc.). She's also conversational, without being overly talkative. All while training and new employee employee. The young woman in training will do well, in following Marley's lead. Also both were very understanding of the needs and associated messiness of us having a one year old in tow."}
{"text":"I went here for an afternoon breakfast,  as soon as we walked in there was no one to greet us at the door so we waited close to ten minutes for the hostess to come to the front and greet us.  We sat down and 5 minutes later the waitress came over,  she did not greet us either,  just asked what we wanted to drink. She took about ten minutes to bring our water,  then another ten minutes to come back and get our order.  Forty minutes later still no food (and the place wasn't even that busy) after forty minutes my orange juice arrives and the waitress just puts it down without saying anything and begins to walk away,  so I ask her if the food is coming out soon and she just says yes.  Another almost fifteen minutes past before the food actually comes out,  and of course the order is not completely correct.  (Boy did I have patience!) The waitress did not come over once to ask if everything was ok,  she just passed by and put the bill on the table.  Completely and utterly rude.  The food was okay,  the experience sucked!  I would never go back."}
{"text":"This was the worst service experience I have ever received!  This was a special occasion for my wife and I,  was hoping for a great breakfast. Instead we ran into a brick wall regards to service. All staff, and I repeat ALL STAFF  ignored our table when we sat down. I'm my experience with service you should always acknowledge any customer who comes into your establishment Period!! I hate to mention that this is the last visit for me and my family. Good luck to Denny's"}
{"text":"I ordered on just eat tonight. The food was exactly how I ordered it and nothing was missing but unfortunately everything was cold (it took just over a hour to get to me). It still tasted fine (except the fries) but not as good as it would of been fresh. I'm sure it would of been just fine had I gone into the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow, just awful. I don't understand how the service could be so horrible. We came, ordered, food took a really long time to come out. We were pretty much the only people in the restaurant... Why? Then the server got another table... That was the end of it all. She didn't come back. No refills, not even once. The lady was a crabby old bag with a large nose. This is Denny's, I don't expect perfection but I do expect service better than a 2 year old would provide. Thanks a lot Cynthia B. You ruined my evening."}
{"text":"If I could put no stars I would. The service was super terrible. The waitress got our order wrong And took forever to check on us. When I brought it up to the manager he looked less then pleased to help. Then they took a long time for a remake we had to ask for check before they even gave us the remake. And still charged us for the order and it was wrong again!!! I will never ever go there again."}
{"text":"On Thursday the 18th of June 2015, a group of 4 of us went to have dinner at this Denny's they had changed a lot of the wait staff since we were last there. We use to get decent food and good service until this time. Omg what a disaster, we got ther around 5pm, they get us seated and brought us drinks. Then the ones of us that ordered salad got those,  Now this is where it all went wrong it get all they way to 6pm, not main courses, we can here the kitchen help mentioning part of your order, Nd still no food. They didn't tell us they were having a problem with any of the order, didn't ask us if we wanted something else they just start eg orang us. By 6:15p we are now made and get up and are leaving, no food. No one comes out to ask us to stay or tell us our meal is on the way out! We hear someone in the kitchen say don't worry about the Baja Burgers they are leaving. Wow this place lost my money, worst way treated in a resturant ever. Oh I forgot to mention they hardly had any customers, maybe 1/3 full."}
{"text":"Hubby & I came here often during a quick few days in Monroeville recently. Standard Denny's, was clean and everyone was friendly. Food and portions were good.  Must give special shout out to Joseph who works the late night shift. He was so warm and welcoming, we told him so and also left him a nice tip accordingly. During the day, I had Margaret take my takeout order. She was also super nice and friendly, definitely appreciated the great customer service here!"}
{"text":"I took my sons to Denny's today it was a little crowded because there were a lot of people graduating and getting out of school early. But the wait was not long and the coffee was hot fresh and bold!   Dennys was recently remodeled so the view and atmosphere is nice, it looks more spacious and comfortable.  Deb is my favorite waitress here and she's always ready with a nice seat, her dynamic personality and fresh coffee just the way I like it \"BOLD!\"  My favorite item is the veggie skillet with a little sliced chicken! All the skillets are nice and they come to the table steaming! Love it!!!  Oh yes if you're an AARP member be sure to show your card at checkout to get 15% off your entire bill!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! We just sat down and when we received our meal there were baby roaches coming out from under the plates. We called the waiter over and she saw them and all she offered was to move us to the next table over. When we told her no we wanted to speak to a manager she gave slight attitude as she walked away to get him. When the manager came over to our table he tried to justify the roaches with \"we just recently had sprayed so maybe their just coming up from the carpets. We can move you to another section and remake your food\" remaking food doesn't justify the fact that your establishment is unsanitary and unsafe."}
{"text":"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #302 - #365.                  We were staying at Encore just a 2 minute walk north of our hotel and wanted a budget friendly breakfast. So we decide to eat at America's favorite diner, \"Denny's!\"  The restaurant was packed and we only waited for 10 minutes before getting called. Our server was friendly as well as the rest of the staff. I ordered the Grand Slam and orange juice, the food was just ok in my book. We were always checked on for refills and if the food was cooked perfectly. I like how the staff goes out of their way to please the customer.   If I'm staying at the Encore again, I'll be sure to come back to this Denny's location for an affordable breakfast and good service. I know the food in Encore will cost an arm and a leg!"}
{"text":"I come here very late at night all the times. My favorite thing to order is the Prime Ribs Cobb Salad. Bomb"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this location other than it's WAY CLEANER than the one up the road! Not sure how that one is still in business!  Food is always correct when i order and the waitresses are always sweet and accommodating here. The nachos are my absolute favorite app and their skillets are delicious. I recommend the smoked Gouda, broccoli and prime rib skillet. My only complaint is it's gone before I know it"}
{"text":"Wow. This location needs shut down. I'm not sure what the logic is between having two Denny's within a half mile of each other anyways, but oh my God. Let me tell you about this Denny's. I have been here twice against my will when dining out with other people who decided they wanted to come here. The first time we came here was later in the afternoon maybe around 2 p.m. There was NO ONE WORKING. Yeah I mean no one at all. No one cooking, no one serving tables, and no one eating. There were filthly dishes and dirty napkins everywhere on the floor and all the tables, and it took about 20 minutes before we even saw ONE worker come out from the back. People were getting up and leaving without paying their checks, which I completely understand. A few people were just sitting in booths with no food, no drinks, nothing. It was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in my life. We also left after sticking around just for the entertainment. The second time I made the mistake of coming here, I was with two other friends. After dinner, we decided to get a slice of cheesecake for dessert. Our server brought out a piece of the cake and we all started digging in until my friend noticed a brown curly hair resembling a pube on her spoon. She pulled it out and immediately knew it wasn't any of ours because we are all blonde. We called the manager over and showed him the hair and he wasnt even apologetic, he just laughed and said he would bring us a new piece. When he came back with a new slice, he set it down on our table and said \"here you go, we shaved this one for you\" as a joke. None of us laughed because it was clearly disgusting. Like I said before, this place needs shut down."}
{"text":"our server ROYCE rushed us for our order didnt refill our water , forgot our extra order of hash browns and bacon, and to top it off he yelled at another employee right in front of us, her name was joyce and she was very sweet letting us know royce was coming because we waited about 7minuets before we saw anyone. i dont recommend it.  also if youre passing through primm SKIP DESPARADO rollercoaster very dangerous,"}
{"text":"The staff was really irritable with each other and it made me uncomfortable. It wasn't kitchen nightmares or anything, but it wasn't very inviting. The food was fine and our waitress was nice, though you could tell she didn't enjoy her job. I'd choose another location next time."}
{"text":"This is a follow up on our previous recommendation regarding the TET Denny's restaurant we are very impressed with the service manager is been exceptionally cooperative and helpful and I would give that a shot five stars and recommended to any folks that are staying in the area this area of Las Vegas sign sign Don Morris commander United States Naval this is affordable restaurant"}
{"text":"As close to a perfect Denny's as you probably come to: service was prompt, featured multiple coffee refills, I didn't have to ask for my check after my plate was cleared, and the food (Denny's standard, so not anything to get excited over) came out within minutes. That's short order diner-style goodness, and thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"Ahhhh....Jenny's. Good ole Jenny's. Gay as gay can be. Depending on when you are there of course. I've found myself at Jenny's post bar rush stuffing my pie hole with a club sandwich, fries and many glasses of Coca Cola.   Then there's the late morning, early afternoon call from friends who want to gather at Jenny's, eat greasy food to soak up the previous evening's booze and dish about who fell down, who got arrested and who will end up on dirty.com! Of course, we all secretly hope it is us!  I love diner waitresses. They get it. They have the patience of a saint and the sass and swagger of a sailor. All the while delivering my hot plate of eggs, shredded hash browns (can you say Ore Ida!?), various meats and extra butter on the toast please. God bless 'em. God bless them all!   So Jenny's has a place in our hearts. Not on Valentine's Day. Not on the books for New Year's Eve. But, dayum, if I'm not grateful to have you Jenny on that famous CenPho corner, we call 7th Street and Camelback."}
{"text":"The Bourbon Chicken Skillet was great, the serving was slow but the food was worth it. My husband ordered the Country Fried Steak with mashed potatoes he said it was good. We got seared right away and the staff was friendly. The restrooms were cleaned and kids eat free on Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Awful. Coffee was 2+ hours old, understaffed, ordered the \"honey jalape√±o bacon cheeseburger\" and the only things not burnt was the lettuce, the tomato, and the pickles. Reasonably sure the pickles weren't supposed to be there. Cheese was  crispy-burnt, the bacon was literally black, and to top it off, when i cut the burger in half, i found a hair in the middle.   Naturally, i wanted to talk to one of the servers about it, but after 5 minutes, i got fed up and left (my fault, i just got off a 14 hour shift, my fuse was short) and of course, they noticed THAT. The server followed me into the parking lot, and demanded i pay before i leave, or she was going to take a picture of my license plate, and call Metro on me.   If i could give 0 stars, i would"}
{"text":"Overall just an awful experience here, unfriendly welcome in and was put on a wait when hardly anyone was in the restaurant. Ordered a Caesar salad and it was not mixed at all and came with hardly any dressing. Dropped a plate off at the table and toast fell off, asked for another and never received it. Only reason this is getting a one star is for the subpar chocolate milk that you can buy anywhere. Dirty tables everywhere and unpeeled avocados in the salad as well. Manager wasn't nice or accommodating at all. Wish I could rate half a star if not even less."}
{"text":"We ended up ordering to go from this Denny's because the credit card machine was down at one of the Chandler locations. The Country Club restaurant has been newly remodeled, and it was very spacious and clean. The customer service was AWESOME. Everyone was very friendly and polite. One of the employees kept us updated on the status of our order as we waited. We ordered two grand slams, and it tasted great; the buttermilk pancakes made me so happy, lol.   My 13 year old made mention as to how nice everyone was, so I had to Yelp it. :) Thanks and keep up the great work; good customer service is rare these days. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I went to Dennys around 9 am on wednesday alone. (As my spouse just left for basic training) I waited in the front for 8 minutes prior to anyone saying a word to me. When greeted by staff they assumed I wanted an order to go. I informed them I'd like to be seated and they had to find someone else to seat me. (During this whole time of entry to being sat many workers would look up at the front but no one came) I have never felt so stupid trying to get a meal.  The waiter had a friendly personality .  He brought my drink out right away. However by the time my food came I needed a refill and did not receive one until I was nearly done with my food.  Food was served hot and good quality."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Denny's in a while. Food was okay. The server took a while to come and bring my drinks and take order. Table was clean but overall it was okay."}
{"text":"Service was great but host that greeted us and gave us a table made us wait and took people that were behind us first She was rude and snippy  Table were clean and we could of set in them ourselves yet she made us wait Disorganized way to seat people The male waiter was very nice and helpful"}
{"text":"I was quite surprised with this location. The place was nice and clean and in good repair, unlike the usual grungy Denny's you expect to walk into. On a late Sunday morning we were able to walk right in a grab a table. The place was busy but not full or overly loud and crowded. Other than the initial long wait to get our drinks, our server was completely on top of things through our whole visit.  I ordered the All American Slam. Its a pretty straight forward meal which was well cooked. My girlfriend ordered a seasonal special which included berry pancakes. They were huge! She couldn't finish them so I had a couple of bites. They were delicious. If I wasn't so full from my meal I would have easily polished them off.  Overall I was quite impressed with this location."}
{"text":"They've always been quick to seat us, quick to serve. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal from them, it's always quite consistent. The servers are friendly and on top of it without being the hovering type. It's always clean and bright in there too. It's one of the best Denny's I've been to. Perfect place for late night food."}
{"text":"We had planned on eating a late breakfast at the Original Breakfast House just down 32nd Street, but did not realize that they would be closed for Labor Day. We headed north toward the Harkins North 16 Cinema and stumbled upon Denny's.  We still had plenty of time before our movie, or so we thought.  The entryway was warm and crowded with people waiting.  Only a ten minute wait was indicated, so we decided to stay.  When we were seated, we noticed the restaurant itself seemed a bit warm as well.  We waited a very long time just to have our presence recognized by a server.  Eventually, beverage orders were taken.  Coffee was delivered without an offer of creamer and we labored another five minutes just to make eye contact with anyone who could bring us some.  Food orders were finally taken and were served in a reasonable amount of time, although there was a significant amount of time between when the first person in our party and the last was served.  Not a big deal, but it's awkward to postpone eating until everyone is served and awkward when they insist that you go ahead and eat.  Well, it's Denny's.  The food was fine.  Uninspired.  Just what you'd expect.  Given that you can eat at a really good breakfast joint just a few blocks away, however, I'm just not sure why you'd want to settle for this.  I'm pleased that the Original Breakfast House treats their employees well with the day off, but I doubt that I would ever head back to Denny's anytime OBH was open.  By the time we were finishing, we had used all of our available time and felt as though we'd been eating in a sauna.  The restaurant never cooled down.  Not revealed to us when we checked in was the not insignificant fact that their air conditioning was broken.  Not all of their air conditioning.  Only the part where their patrons were seated.  Revealing this tidbit of information to customers when they came in the door would have been the honorable thing to do.  Yes, we probably would have elected to go elsewhere, but it's what any good restaurant would do for their customers.  But not Denny's.        This Denny's is nice in appearance and some employees seem well intentioned.  When you are serving \"average\" food, however, it's critical that employees and managers go above and beyond to compensate. That did not happen on this day.  Not even close."}
{"text":"It's Denny's. So.... really not much to say about it other than this location in right by CSN Charleston, and therefore is usually full of hungry college kids looking for a cheap meal. Though, it really isn't cheap when you consider what you are getting. I got a skillet meal thing that was so not worth 7$, and it came with the lovely snotty mood of our waitress.  The only thing they really have going for them that is not like Ihop would be their bacon thing right now, where they add bacon to EVERYTHING, including a brownie sundae, for whatever morbid reason."}
{"text":"Isabelle was our waitress and was great. Food came out quick and was delicious. Place was clean and the renovations are really nice."}
{"text":"Bad service! Went to this location three times. Out of 3 times, always horrible and slow service."}
{"text":"Everyone knows Denny's isn't that great of a restaurant, but it's a great place to eat after a long night, especially because it's open 24 hours. However, I've always loved their food, but after an incident, I will never go to that Denny's ever again! After waiting 20 minutes to finally be seated we ordered our drinks and saw a cockroach climbing up the wall right next to us. It made all of us scream and get out of our seats, the waitress came to bring our drinks and we told her there was a cockroach. Her response was so unprofessional, she said \"oh would you like to order now.\" Not even apologizing or anything!!! We told her we couldn't eat there and left the restaurant."}
{"text":"Gross. Just gross. Bad service, bad food."}
{"text":"Place is dirty and bathrooms look like outhouses.  Ordered French toast very dry. Pretty sure it sat u set heat lamps for a while.  This place is sooo dirty!! Run"}
{"text":"Yes Denny's get slammed by most people as bad food, but much like my sizzler review I am going against the grain, is it gourmet, certainly not, but they have certainly stepped up their \"game\" and to be honest, for me, they make a damn good burger, certainly better than 5 Guys.  So yes I built my own burger, a simple affair with mushrooms, bacon and cheddar cheese, along with thick cut fries and a diet coke...Yeah I know, but I prefer the taste of diet to regular.  Anyways, burger cooked perfectly, juicy with good flavor, fries cooked to a nice crisp golden brown.  All in all a great meal for $8 plus tip."}
{"text":"Would give this place 0 stars if I could. The staff here are incredibly slow. We were made to wait to be seated and people who arrived later were seated first.  Not only that the people who came later and ordered later than us, got their food first. When we FINALLY GOT OUR FOOD, the steak was almost completely raw and not hot at all.   The salmon was not fresh too. The steak was re-cooked and came back like rubber.   Would not recommended anyone to eat here."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Got in, place wasn't packed, waited for 5 mins to be seated, sat on a booth and waited 15 mins and no service. No one offered us drinks, no nothing. We left. They weren't even that busy. They weren't understaffed. Absolutely no excuse. And I'm used to horrible service."}
{"text":"This is my third time at this Denny's over the last 20 years. Each time I have been here they are crazy busy, but the staff (which I'm sure has changed over the years) is still helpful and welcoming.   Food is good to any Denny's standard. Our waitress was fabulous! We were seated in a fair amount of time considering the volume and our food arrived faster than I expected and was hot considering how packed they were.   I will continue to pick them as a breakfast stop when I make another trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Denny's is Denny's but sometimes the service ruins the experience. Shortage of help in this location makes the meal a bummer. Hard to get coffee refills and even had to work at getting a check to pay the bill. I will avoid this one in the future"}
{"text":"Not the best of attitudes, I thought this place might be under staffed but realized there weren't a lot of customers there. Nearly a 40 minute wait for a cheeseburger. I was  told that medium well done was my only option for the burger, no mediam rare. I never experienced that at any other Denny's locations. Milkshake normally comes with a full glass plus what's left over in the the tin. The menu even says extra is in the tin. I had to ask for the remaining shake in the tin and the waitress thought that was a joke and went back to the kitchen area complaining that I actually wanted what I was paying for.Manager appeared stressed but did a good job of keeping a happy face and was actually working hard to keep customers happy. Waitress, named Dawn did not do a good job of appearing to give a damn. Slow waitres who did not appear to want to be there. For $10 burger and a $4 milkshake go to Johnny Rockets.. I will never make the mistake of returning to this location again in this lifetime - Go to Eastern and Flamingo location for a better experience."}
{"text":"Don't make it too this location to often but have never had any complaints about service. People are very friendly and that makes all the difference when visiting a Denny's. Place is kept clean to include restrooms."}
{"text":"Service has gone down and I don't think I will ever go back due to a discrepancy with the bill.  I'm not going to risk having somebody spit in my food. It's been a long time since I had to walk in the back and ask for a coffee refill. Felt like cashier lady was trying to take advantage of me because the server screwed up the order. Manager make things right only after some argument and me stating that I felt like I was being swindled. It did feel like I was being put together after poor service. People who were seated after me had their meal before me. Food was okay."}
{"text":"My wife ordered a combo, French toast scrambled eggs Bacon, hash browns and a side of toast. First try served the French toast then a second trip to bring the eggs& bacon w toast! Hash browns no where in sight. After five minute wait they say they thought she took the toast instead. I said my wife asked how much the toast was not could she have one for the other. Then he brought out my blueberry puppy pancakes burnt to almost black and argued with me over whether they were burnt and finally when reserved there was no blueberries to be found! Mgr comped the check but WTF how do you run a business like this"}
{"text":"Service is inviting and fast.   This restaurant has servers that work together.   The food is good and well seasoned (not always common in a diner).    Overall a very good Denny's."}
{"text":"Okay first to be fair all the help were friendly and got orders right. BUT I ate there five times this week and each and every time they brought a meal WITHOUT silverware. Bizarre because unpopulated tables have it.  I don't understand how four different servers all made this same basic mistake.  I kind of got the idea some of the waitstaff were new not only to the restaurant but waiting tables period."}
{"text":"I tried to call in a to-go order here. I tried calling five times it never was answered so I drove to Denny's to place my to-go order in person and now that I'm here waiting for it outside I see the general manager outside smoking a cigarette just about the whole time I've been waiting for my to-go order. Good luck with a manager like that."}
{"text":"It's denny's so you pretty much know what your gonna get.. But the staff at this location is what makes it stand out.. Everything I have gone the wait staff has been friendly and good at there job. It your heading out of town going West it's a good place to stop and get some eats just before leaving the city.."}
{"text":"Not a very good place to eat at. The waitress was good but the cook was terrible as two things that were order they were out and he didn't care to tell or let the waitress know before people ordered. They were out of the hoggie buns and then for the other order they were out of Swiss cheese but still served it with no word about. At least the hoggie sandwich was able to switch out for something else. Very bad service of the cook as there is no communication to the waitresses."}
{"text":"Went to try the new Burgers and when I got my burger the bun was all smashed and leaning to the side. I asked the waitress to please have the cook change the bun because it is smashed so she took the burger then brought it back but the cook only changed the top bun of the burger when both buns where smashed. I told the lady that I no longer wanted the burger and she had attitude with me oh to make things worse they charged me for the burger still. I do not recommend you go to this Denny's at this location."}
{"text":"I went to Denny's because I just wanted a decent meal without much fuss. i need higher standards.   I got to Denny's a little after 7am this morning - there were some people there, but not many. I was greeted. Well, if you consider a guy yelling from the back \"WAIT THERE\" a greeting, I was greeted.   I ordered a vegetable omelet which included chopped squash, mushrooms, spinach and swiss cheese. The vegetables were great - fresh, cooked enough - pleasing. The swiss cheese . . . um you know how overly processed food, especially cheese, when it cools it does so into a rather disgusting blob and it wasn't that good to begin with. Yeah, it was swiss-cheese-like... sorta.  I got two pieces of whole wheat toast - 25% of my toast was burnt to a crisp. Who WANTS burnt toast? I thought about sending it back, but didn't really need a full two pieces of toast. Still, the bread is so expensive you have to serve it after you burn it?  The strawberry jam . . . meh, at best.   The service was excellent, I must say. I paid some $10+, no beverage, but including tip and tax. Yeah, not planning on going back to Denny's - I could have made the same meal at home for about $1.50 and not burned the toast.   Oh, and the guy who yelled \"WAIT THERE\"? Maybe he had just eaten breakfast and he thought I might run back to my car. I should have."}
{"text":"It's Denny's! What do you expect! The food is cheap, filling, and of course, overly sweet. I came here for the free grand slam on my birthday but have been here a couple of times before. The service is usually quick, not the most attentive but they have quite a large space with little corners to work around.  Everything said, it's decent breakfast food, nothing spectacular but I think that's what they aim for."}
{"text":"This is my go to dennys. It's close by to me and it's newer interior is welcoming. They have old music playing which I love. The staff is consistent and they are helpful. The food is your typical american diner food but they usually have specials going on. What I love about dennys in general is there's always some sort of special and they are open 24 hours(breakfast, lunch, dinner anytime)!! The special this time is 3 courses for a set price depending on the skillet. My meal consisted of a caesar salad(typical lettuce, dressing, cheese), prime rib skillet(prime-rib,cheese,potatoes,broccoli,bacon) and a mini dessert( I chose the pancake hush puppies with vanilla ice cream). As my drink I did a chocolate milkshake. I was left full and everything was good. If you know dennys then you know their salad and dessert can be big, but with this meal they were smaller. This is a good thing as the skillet was filling and if the salad and dessert were any bigger something would have been left unfinished.  So while this is your typical dennys, if you like dennys in general then you will like this one. 4 stars from me for location,quality of food and staff, quantity of food, and price."}
{"text":"Service is good, and reasonably fast, but this place is lax with their cleanliness and my food was terrible!  I saw the host use a sopping wet rag to clean off the table and the chairs.  This was after we pointed out that the table we had just been seated at was not clean.  Still afterwards there was sticky syrup everywhere on the floors and seat.   My quesadilla was the worse one I have ever had!  I wanted to send it back, but the manager had already visited our table due the syrup issue.  So I just attempted to choke down the world's nastiest Quesadilla imaginable.  It tasted like they put nutmeg on it."}
{"text":"It's very busy, and we wait for 30 minuets to order the meal. Also, service is too bad, no one served to us before I called someone to order the food even if there are not to much customer in store. I felt they just skip us because other people who came after us is already ordered the meal. This is my first time in Denny's, and I would never go to Denny's anymore. The experience is so bad."}
{"text":"If you ever want to receive horrible service, with cocky attitudes, and incompetent people... Then you will definitely enjoy being here... I asked about the discrepancy on my receipt and the waiter snatched the receipt out of my hand and walked away... I asked was he alright and he stated yes, although we didn't receive a military discount, the service sucks and the place isn't up to par... Thanks for the horrible experience as I visit Arizona... NEVER WILL I RETURN TO THIS LOCATION..."}
{"text":"Horrible service and when they finally took my order and my food came out it was horrible. I ordered the breakfast sandwhich and the bread had a huge mold spot. With fibers and stuff growing out of it. After I spoke to the manager and told him they kept telling me that it was the type of bread they use and that it looks that way after its toasted. I'm a chef and that style of bread isn't suppose to look like that. Bullshit and disgusting. After I argued for a bit they finally gave me something else. Which took forever. Horrible"}
{"text":"I walked in too ordered a grilled cheese sandwich , When I got it , the cheese wasn't melted the whole way so they took it back ! when it arrived back too me , I noticed the plate was super hot ! and it was microwaved ! horrible customer service !"}
{"text":"Has to be one of the worst breakfast I ever had my life toast that was not toasted scrambled eggs with more butter than you can think on it cold coffee and it cost me $11 and the bacon was a smallest I've ever seen two slices place needs to be shut down"}
{"text":"What a drastic change this eatery made when relocating directly on the corner of 43 & Peoria.  It's clean, friendly, and conscientious about customer service.  I've been delighted as a regular for a while....but hesitated to write a review.  We all have our own objective cases for handing out stars...I really can't see giving a 5 star rating to a national chain.  You know some days you just crave those dang pancakes, and the best part of a chain is you can expect the same tasting buttermilk pancake every time.   What makes my location differentiated...they will, without asking, empty my cold coffee, and refill my mug! WHAT?  That's a service NOT taught at a national level.   Seems Denny's has found its re-evolution stage in marketing! I'm glad...because it's right by my Phoenix house."}
{"text":"It's time to give credit where credit is due !!  I have been a patron of Denny's ever since I first encountered the restaurant while traveling to go to graduate school in California.  It was my first time to order pancakes with blueberry syrup.  And I have never stopped looking for a Denny's to this day, wherever I go.  It is what it is, a fast food diner, but if you appreciate food consistently prepared, with a huge menu of varieties to choose from, and always available on a 24 hour basis, you just have to like Denny's.  If you like pastry, Denny's is one of the few places available today that, wherever you travel, has a really wide variety of desserts and fountain offerings.  I often go and substitute an apple crisp or a banana split for a dinner meal.  It was recently necessary for me to make two cross-country moves within a year's time, and I was so grateful to be able to find a Denny's available at the destination points, where I could expect nice and enjoyable meals during the move-in process.  Denny's is not inexpensive, but it delivers the goods reliably, all the time.  I just have to thank Denny's for having me as their guest so often when I really needed a dependable place for meals !!"}
{"text":"I expected so much more. It wasn't that busy and yet took over 10 min to place my order. Then after another 15 we still didn't have our drinls the hostess asked if everything was ok. I said I think we're just going to leave. So as we were leaving the waitress actually said where's the Honky going"}
{"text":"Every time  I go here my family gets put in the back corner even if it's not busy at all. The servers don't come around and my order is always wrong"}
{"text":"I normally have a good experience at this Denny's the handful of times I've been there; however, I am so upset almost to tears over our breakfast experience this morning. Our server Dillon was apparently very off put by the fact that he'd be serving me and my three kids that he has mind up up from the start. I literally have never felt bullied by a server the way this person made my (perfectly respectful) children and I feel.  I was told \"no, I'm too busy for that\" when I asked him to clear a few empty glasses, as well as MANY other extremely rude comments made under his breath and while walking away. The straw that broke the camels back was when he handed me some napkins (I didn't ask for them but he found time) and said \"you're welcome to leave as soon as you're finished eating\" As a nurse, I understand that serving people can be difficult at times, but this guy needs to find a new line of work...my six year old was even shocked!! By the time I had finally had enough and asked for the manager, Jennifer and fully explained the situation to her she was mortified as well. She told me she would talk to him and ask him to come out and apologize for his rudeness. I waited for Dillons return, which never came and when Jennifer returned I asked her if he was refusing to apologize to me to which she replied that he was. She was going to be reporting his insubordination to the GM, Michael Frohling. I will be following up with him as well, since I am absolutely mortified by his behavior.  Go be a woman hater somewhere else buddy...Denny's ain't your gig! If you go to this Denny's on a Sunday morning beware of Dillon!"}
{"text":"I was here 2 weeks ago on a Sunday, soon after reopening following renovations.  It look great! Done in \"Coffee House\"neutrals, they replaced everything: lights, booths, chairs, tables, and, mercifully, the carpet.   We were seated immediately,  but after almost 10 minutes I had to go find somebody to take our drink order. We ordered the senior turkey dinners. The server, while nice, could have done better. Both our dinners were cold; we sent them back. She forgot our cranberry sauce. Both times. When she brought our check, we told her (she never checked on our dinners or we would have told her). We wanted dessert, but she never even asked us and when I try to place a dessert order, she walked away. We paid and left.  I came back the next day for breakfast. What a difference! The server, a guy, was great. The pumpkin cream pancakes I ordered were light, fluffy, hot and delicious and had a generous portion of pumpkin cream on them. My coffee was hot. I was happy."}
{"text":"Ooohhhh the pancakes. They are sooooo good! Wait staff is fast and friendly and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"Seeing one lick their finger before handling anything made of paper is already gross, but when a server does it,  it's revolting. You lick your thumbs and then serve me? Really? That's unsanitary and I definitely don't want your saliva in my food/drink."}
{"text":"I could take or leave this place. We've been to Denny's in Ohio so we know what to expect. This Denny's seemed to be of lower quality than others. I usually get the Moons over My Hammy because I'm a grilled cheese kinda person and the name is funny. Their version was dry, the meager cheese was overheated, and the \"egg-square\" was tasteless.   My partner ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, chicken sausage and pancakes. She tried twice more to get the eggs right but they obviously couldn't make real scrambled eggs. They can only do dry squares!  The server was pleasant but in all service was a tad slow."}
{"text":"We came here after a stress-filled morning and were pleasantly surprised. This Denny's is nothing like the one we'd been to previously. The cook actually did a great job, the service was spot-on and the waitress was awesome."}
{"text":"Worst Dennys ive ever been to!!! Yes, it gets pretty busy but to wait 45 mins is just ridiculous! We came in as a group of 16. Got split into 4 groups everyone ate except our table. Everyone finished eating and we still hadnt gotten our main dish. We kept on asking other waiters to bring us things cause the table wasnt set up. Its so upsetting since were from out of state and had high expectations for this place. And the manager still charged us for the food we got after 30 mins. No utensils, no sugar, got a \"clean\" cup with lipstick on it. FUCKING DISGUSTING!!! We had an event to go to and now were late cause we have to stop somewhere else to grab some breakfast!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here before, but today will be our last.  Waitress has been inattentive,  ice tea tasted off,  food was not cooked as requested.  It's extremely dusty and there is crayon on the booth dividers.  The prices on breakfast for two are higher than they used to be.  We'll stick with mom & pop diners from now on."}
{"text":"This is the worst Denny's I have ever been to. This is the second time I come here with my husband and we decided to try it again to give them a second chance. We were wrong! We were greeted by a lady who wreaked of cigarettes so bad it was nauseating. After she sat us she said she was going to wash her hands. She went behind the counter and was back at our table before I could open my menu. Did she dip her hands in water? No one can wash their hands that fast especially someone who is working with food!! This place needs to stop hiring Crack heads who act like they have better things to do than get my order. I'll find an IHOP next time."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT Denny's, as far as Denny's go.  I used to work here, and I can tell you that everything is very clean, and the staff is well-trained.  Something to try: The strawberry lemonade. It's lemonade with strawberry preserves blended into it (comparable to cheesecake factory).  When people ordered it, I used to just bring them a carafe (free refills, so no extra charge), because everyone always wanted at least 4 refills. Something to watch for: Ordering 2 eggs, toast, and bacon will cost you A LOT more than ordering the combo. A new server might not know that they have a combo that includes what you're ordering, and might input the items separately, if you order them that way.   Something to avoid: Complicated orders.  Hate to say it, guys, but the cooks here very rarely speak perfect English.  It's very difficult to make them understand the special requests.  Either way, if you want your breakfast cooked on a separate griddle, with \"just a splash of grape seed oil\" because you have a \"sensitive stomach\" you really shouldn't be eating at Denny's in the first place.  Of course if you want something substituted, sauce on the side, poached eggs etc. that's completely fine."}
{"text":"The food was horrible. I ordered the Red, White and Blue Slam with a side of bacon. The blueberry pancakes tasted like they were reheated in the microwave and dry, the bacon was burnt, refried and full of grease and my plastic cup of water had brown stuff stuck at the bottom. This is my first and last time here."}
{"text":"I usually go to Denny's for their breakfast.  I've never ventured out to their lunch/dinner menu. Now I know why I avoided it for so long. It was not good. I had the \"new\" Chicken and Avocado Sandwich.  It had pico de gallo and sour cream on it too. The only thin I tasted was sour cream and chicken. The pico de gallo and avocado had no flavor whatsoever. My fries also were way too salty and didn't come out with the sandwich. Not a huge deal.  We did have a few more food issues around the table. My wife's turkey bacon was not cooked at all. It looked like it came right out of the package. Her toast was also burnt--both items were sent back.  Our waitress was quick and friendly about the errors and was very apologetic.  Luckily my daughter didn't finish her pancakes so I did enjoy something.  From now on, it's breakfast at Denny's."}
{"text":"It was early Saturday morning, I was hungry and did not want fast food, so I ended up at Denny's. This was my second time at this Denny's (1st time was November '12 so you can see that I don't come here often) and my expectations hadn't changed from when I went the first time, but I was going to give them a second chance since I'm such a nice person : )   We were greeted by a some what enthused hostess who seemed as though she didn't want to be bothered, but I brushed it off and figured she was having a rough morning. There was about a 15 minute wait which was to be expected as it was a Saturday morning and before I knew it I was sitting down and greeted by a warm smile. Our server was great and he was very knowledgeable about the food and drinks, which is always a plus. I decided to order the \"Build Your Pancake Combo\" and had whole wheat chocolate chip pancakes (I did not like them AT ALL and ended up eating my mom's Pancake Puppies), bacon that was fatty and rubbery, bland scrambled eggs, and way too hard hash browns. Needless to say, I did not enjoy my breakfast, BUT I did enjoy some of my mom's Philly cheesesteak omelette and Pancake Puppies so I did get to eat something.   For this trip to Denny's I give them 3 stars for average, because the service was really good, the bathrooms were clean (thank goodness), and the Pancake Puppies were yummy (TRY THESE!), but the food overall was sub par.  Finally I noticed that Denny's now serves Barefoot wine, has plenty of flat screens and claims to be the place to be to watch the Carolina Panthers play. I guess they are trying to compete with the other sports bars in the area....good luck with that!"}
{"text":"I'll never understand how they can be so patient at this dennys. I was not sober, the waiter asked me for my order three times before i responded, and STILL had a smile on her face. oh, did i mention it was at 6 in the morning?  The guy at the table behind us knocked out and was snoring over his food to boot. You don't expect great food at denny's. You expect denny's food. it's not any better here than at any other location and it's not any worse either. food came out quickly, and it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar is breakfast with a show. I've never been to a busier breakfast joint & the servers pick up their tables orders from the line immediately in front of the bar.   As a result, service can be iffy & in fact, we received the wrong bill, about $20 higher than what we'd ordered. The people next to us apparently didn't have the integrity to notify the server they received the wrong check & left with a decent discount.   Our server was cool though & despite being swamped gave us the correct order & tried his best to be attentive. The whole experience was entertaining to say the least. The food, pretty unmemorable except for the delicious vanilla yogurt. Fantastic! I'm a fan of their grand slam because it provides so much flexibility. No bread (for me), substitute fruit/yogurt- yeah, I like having options.   I can't imagine waiting 30 minutes for a table like many did but I'd come back for another mid morning, kitchen line show from the bar."}
{"text":"Honestly I am not sure why this place has so much hate.... we arrived sometime around 9 and was seated right away. Waitress took our drink order and brought out an apple juice for the goofball and a coffee for me. Both were delicious and we then proceeded to order. I was dying to try the banana bread french toast so I got that slam and he got a burger. We split a $2 plate of pancakes and added strawberries and whipped cream for a dollar. His burger was deliciously juicy and the seasoned fries were really good... kinda like curly fries from arby's without being curly. The slam was pretty good though the banana bread french toast was not quite as amazing as I had hoped..it was a bit too sweet. But everything else was great and since it is so close to GCU I may be back."}
{"text":"normally this is the denny's my friends and I always go and we never have any complaints. this time we show up about 1 am (usually the time we always go,late night dinner trips) i guess the waiter was there by himself and was in the process of counting his drawer. he had us seat ourselves on the left side of the building so he could start cleaning the right side. not an issue, we picked our own table. about 10 minutes pass and we still haven't  gotten menus,our drinks,or even an introduction. we understand hes alone doing things but for Someone from OUR table having to get back up and retrieve menus HERSELF from the front so we  could be ready to order by the time the worker was ready for us. absolutely ridiculous.It was about 25 minutes (I'm at the point where I'm ready to go home considering were the only group waiting on him and we havent even gotten beverages ) he finally comes up to us and apologized for the wait,that drinks are on him.(soda only) we ordered the limited edition milkshalk (Graham cracker one i believe) and didn't even get the extra in the tin cup (which clearly was stated on the menu that the extra  was provided). We order our food and it finally comes out and my order got mixed up with another person at our table. I ordered plain pancakes and she got the pumpkin sauce pancakes. they put pumpkin on both orders of pancakes.i let it slide and tried it out thinking it might be good and I hate sending my food back.I was not going to wait another 10 minutes for new pancakes. it was absolutely disgusting btw.considering I'm 8 months pregnant I was trying to be home and In bed by 2am because i had a doctors appointment in the morning, I didn't get home until almost 3. Worst denny's trip ever and i wish i would have gotten the waiters name. only thing i can tell you is he had glasses and i think it was tuesday the 18th @1am. we love the dennys itself and Will be returning of course ,just not when that man is there. we have never had an issue with any other waiter/waitress on our late night trips."}
{"text":"Came here this morning around 8:30. I was greeted and taken to a booth. Tammy was great. I got a coffee and looked over the menu. I decided on the fit fare skillet but was seriously considering the banana bread French toast. The skillet was hot and tasty with many veggies and lots of potatoes. It came topped with two delicious eggs and a salsa cup on the side. Total came to ten and change before tip. I will be back to try the French toast."}
{"text":"So I have avoided this location due to all the reviews saying bad food and because I really like the one on Northern. However due to a busy schedule I only had time to go here. Not sure why all the bad reviews. Food was good and had great service... I especially like the fact they have healthy options that don't cost too much plus a nice value menu that includes things like all you can eat pancakes and the value slam."}
{"text":"Straight up awful. I moved to Las Vegas I stay right next to this place. This place is awful I have tried several times to make call in orders they just put me on hold.I go across the street to order and I just want to leave the staff is a bunch of people who really just don't want to be there, the service is slow, and it's just not a good place to go if you are visiting Vegas  ..or living here for that matter"}
{"text":"They had great food try the SantaFe Skillet delicious. But they have a tremendous waiter, named David. This gentleman belongs in a 5 Star restaurant with out a doubt, he made the evening for me and my family. The night shift, wow what service. Just go one time you will walk out with a smile, Dennys is really lucky to have this guy:) Wgag a great pleasure, thank you David!!"}
{"text":"Visited Denny's during graveyard shift on February 5th and what a great experience it was. The cook on duty last night did an awesome job with preparing our food. Our service was Superb! Our server, Cathy was extremely efficient, attentive, great people skills. Overall I would give the following ratings to Denny's. (1 being worst to 10 being best)  Food Quality ---10 Food presentation-- 10 Our Server Cathy --- 10 Cleanliness of Restaurant -- 8 Wait time to be seated -- 10 Overall appearance of Restaurant -- 8"}
{"text":"Rather not comment on the food and our old salads however, our waitress Veronica was PHENOMENAL!! She was super attentive, funny, and listed to our particular orders. Wish NJ had more waitresses like her!"}
{"text":"Just came back from here for brunch and it was awesome. Excellent service is an understatement; our waitress was very nice, patient, and considerate. Offered us more to drink and was very detail about the new meals on the menu. Left her a great well deserved tip. If I was from here, I'll come back all the time."}
{"text":"I know it's one of the \"commercial\" franchised spots you can go to for breakfast, but to be honest it's my fave spot for a morning meal! First off, they serve breakfast alllllll day (so it doesn't matter if you're morning starts at 9am or 2pm..!) The menu is vast with items ranging from breakfast items like eggs and waffles to burgers and salads. The place is large with tons of seating so rarely are you waiting for a seat.  The service is usually pretty friendly, haven't had a bad experience here as of yet.   One more mention..the grand slamwich is the most delicious thing on them menu!!! YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"My husband loves Dennys so we are not new to the atmosphere or the food. Today has to be one of the most exceptional experiences that we have had.  Our server was Senen and he made sure I order was correct and kudos to the cook because our food was delicious. We are looking all and pass multiple locations closer to our home, but the customer service here is for sure one of the best. I was able to get wheat pancakes with bananas and pecans and I was thrilled because it's my absolute favorite way to eat pancakes.   Currently there is a Lemon Berry smoothie and omg is the best way for me to describe it.  I'm super in love with smoothies so I had to try it.  It's only for a limited time so it is for sure a must try.   Senen  was attentive and never was a time that we needed something and had to look around for him.  He always beat us to the punch if refills where needed and checked on us just enough but not harassing.  It was a great balance that some servers struggle with so I'm very grateful to have been seated I need his section.   My husband has to have bacon extra extra crispy and it was to his liking and any place that accomplishes this is always a place he will return too.   Grand Slam with multiple orders of bacon... is that even a meal.  Oh well he likes it.  All in all this is my favorite location despite us being a local and the food is delicious.   Great job to Senen our server and the cooks.  Pleasant pleased and I hope Senen is working on our next visit.   On a side note there is a variety of people who come to this location so it makes for great conversations with people fr ok my all over and even locals.  The environment is very welcoming and it creates a fun time  where people from other tables talked and found to have things in common. I for sure wasn't expecting that, but I must say that was refreshing to say the least."}
{"text":"This location is a joke. They give other Dennys a bad name. The staff ( including the manager on duty ) decided to throw out the oatmeal befor 2:00. So when I ordered some ( 1:30 ish) I was told they were out and they won't make anymore for me. So my \" Grand slam \" consists of 8 pieces of toast, yogurt ( 50 cents extra ), and two sorry looking slices of bacon. I have given them so many more chances then deserved. I will never let myself or my family step foot in this place again! Bottom line, SLOW, RUDE, DIRTY. Never again."}
{"text":"Good food great wait staff. I like it works for me. Though I am not picky I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"1 star Just for food tasting Good and for friendliness.   Other that the service here was SLOW!   Got our food and asked for condiments that took about 10 minutes to be delivered to our table.   Our drinks we're never refilled after we asked twice.   As Im typing this Im sitting here with a dry mouth.   Asked for to-go boxes for our food,  got those but with out a bag to carry them out - it and still waiting for our drinks.  They're not even \"busy\", only about 6/7 tables to wait-on and there's 2 waiters Plus a manager floating around.  I saw the other waiting service all his tables at least 5 times each,  brought there drink refills before they finished their current drinks.  Oh Just got our bill,  yet no bag or drinks.   Never coming back to this location again.   Service must be HORRIBLY SLOW when they're \"busy. \""}
{"text":"Probably the shittiest Denny's I have ever been to. I mean it's Denny's, not much to expect as is...but I think there is at least a level of servitude you should live up to. Lack of service. Lack of respect. Utterly disgusting. Tables were dirty as fuck. The people didn't look clean. Took 20 minutes to be acknowledged that we were even there at all. Then people were seated and taken orders before us. Why the hell is this even still in business?! Manager looked like damn dunce."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go and it was a disaster. I had to send my food back four times and they still couldn't get it right. When a refund was requested, I was told that i'd have to wait for their IT guy to call me and set up the transaction since I paid with a credit card. Still waiting to be contacted..."}
{"text":"Honestly if I could, I would give this location 0 stars. Ever since they remodeled and got new management the service is terrible.  My husband and I stopped in on the way home for some food to go. My husband ordered his food, I'm standing next to him waiting to give my order when some woman comes walking out from the back office yelling something at the top of her lungs. Very unprofessional, but whatever. She comes up to the register and is trying to put cash into the register when she starts yelling at the waitress that people need seated. Mind you, at this point she is directly in front of me on the other side of the counter. I look at her and see her name tag says \"Restaurant Manager\"... Really, this lady, she's the manager... Anyway, so I'm telling the waiter taking our order what I would like. A moons over my hammy, no ham but a veggie patty. And the manager feels the need to loudly butt in, that's not an option for substitution. I try and explain that I've had it that way before, she just refused to listen. She continued to shout and is just flat out rude. I said fine and we walked out. I understand it's busy and it's Christmas Eve, but there is absolutely no need for your rudeness. Instead of just yelling at people that things need done, do them yourself instead of fighting with customers about how they want their food.  This isn't the first problem we've had with this location since the remodel and management change. They have one really really good waitress who has worked their forever, and we love but other than that...  I work in customer service and I know how people should be treated. After. Long day at work all I wanted was some food!!!"}
{"text":"Now, I get that Denny's is an American institution ... But There goes the neighborhood.   First off... All Denny's are exactly the same, so I'm sure if you're a Denny's fan, this location has the same exceptional 'foodstuffs' and service as any locations provide.  and since its new, the place is probably very clean and the employee morale has not yet sunk into a grumbling mass of evil stares.  Typically you find Denny's in above average urban environments or fledgling once middle class suburbs that are slowly deteriorating...  The problem is, nobody asked for Denny's in this perfectly good yuppie location, which is now likely a sign that it's going downhill as we can expect all the low expectation Lenny's to flood into this once pristine American shopping centre.   It's bad enough that there's a Wendy's and chik fil a (absolute garbage food). Now we have cartoned egg breakfast and preservative toast. Where is the green organic cage free breakfast places? I want quinoa and sustainably grown vegetables with my Ezekiel bread toast. This is Truly a tragedy. Maybe Denny's will take a hint and start serving real food?  There is a glimmer of hope however in this story. If of course Denny's turns from its evil ingredients and starts using sustainable farm raised gmo free (real ingredients). They may be able to redeem themselves from the evils of serving crap to paying customers.   Now that they've entered yuppie territory, perhaps there's an opportunity to see the light. And I wish you all the luck in dealing with the yuppie kind you have imposed your organization upon, because they will be asking for fresh squeezed, organic, sustainably grown, cage free, hormone and antibiotic free animal products, and kale smoothies."}
{"text":"Horrible cooks. Waitress doesn't care if your missing the ingredients that were suppose to go in your sandwich. Avocado!!! If you ask for 3 waters you can only have 2. Waitress will only bring you hafe your breakfast oh well if you say something then you get your pancakes after she's done ordering the other tables around her. Then she will ask the cook to make them. But when you get them forget about any syrup. Because you ask for that she will start slamming plates!!!!!!!! If you ask for the manager prepare to wait a long time!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can say the only thing semi impressive with Denny's the last few trips would be their mediocre holiday decorations. The last two times here service has been substandard at best. The food is mediocre without much flavor, unless you personally increase your sodium intake by dousing the plate with salt. The servers are downright rude, rolling their eyes and acting inconvenienced when you ask them to bring the drink you actually ordered instead of what they brought you. This location is also ridden with dirty tables and floors and it's a slow Tuesday morning. Dead flowers on the tables too. Denny's could use a massive makeover in the , cleanliness, flavor, and personality departments.   Not impressed."}
{"text":"It's a long review. Basically STAY AWAY!  In a struggling economy you would think businesses would strive to give good service to stay afloat. Not this Denny's.   My husband asked if he could switch his pancakes for a piece of toast. The waiter returned with a positive no from the manager: \"She said if you could come and see her so that you may explain your situation to her and then she may consider it.\" (Please include a 200 word request as well.) They gave us the toast and the pancakes and added .99 to our bill. The place was filthy. The pancakes had obviously been sitting around and were cold. I asked one of the waiters to bring me something  and after saying \"yeah\" left to never be seen again. We got up half way our meal. We spoke with the manager, who could not provide us with the owner's name. After complaining to her about all of the above she shrugged and said she was sorry and turned around.  This is a hellhole and would prefer to go to McDonald's  and eat there than in this excuse of a restaurant."}
{"text":"R U KIDDING ME!!! eating out of a dumpster would have been more nutritious and it would have been hotter. What happened to these Denny's on the strip in the last 4 years. It appears as if you lost it, Poor food, nasty people work for you now. Management seems to hate what they do and your processes leave a lot to be desired. JUST CLOSE THEM ALL and give them to a fast food joint. Denny's in Vegas has IMPLODED!!! in the last 5 years. 15 years ago it was bad, 10 years ago it improved quite a lot. NOW your just a joke on the strip. I met people who said in 2009 it was great, 2011 it was great but since 2014 it has been a disaster Do us a favo and sell them or close them all down so we can get food at a decent price but served by people who care, DENNYS IS A DISASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Detour. Franchise owned and operated. No standards. I went into the place with the lowest of expectations. It's Denny's, I have a pretty good idea of what to expect. At 4AM after a long shift my judgement ain't the best. Whatever the arrangement is between corporate Denny's and the franchisee, it needs to be terminated. Awful awful awful. I will never ever ever enter another Denny's Restaurant for the rest of my life. If you occasionally eat at Denny's stay away from this one for sure. The experience will scar you for life!"}
{"text":"Do not go here. Service is terrible. Go to Skyland or Waffle House... better yet go buy a collared shirt at Walmart on Arrowwood and go to the Men's Club... better view and at least they pretend they want you there."}
{"text":"If we go out to eat for breakfast I either like to go to Bob Evans or it has to be a Ihop.  Usually we just end up making breakfast at home.  This wasn't the case the past few months.  We had a couple coupons for breakfast at Denny's so we decided to try them out.  It was a few years since we last ate breakfast at Denny's.       I kept seeing the advertisement about their new buttermilk pancakes.  So the first time that we came here I did get the pancakes with bacon, eggs and potatoes.  They were good.  I don't remember what they used to taste like but they were slightly better than average pancakes to me.       The second time around I ordered the almost exact thing but this time I ordered French toast and I really did enjoy them.  It was really good French toast and I would come back for that.  My wife did enjoy her breakfast too.  She is not a pancake eater but she liked her breakfast slam and her eggs.  Like usual she gave me her pancakes!   They have good coffee here as well.       Overall it was ok breakfast food and I would come back for the French toast.  The service was good too.  Our waitresses were very nice and very helpful when I had some menu questions.  One more note I think this is a good place to take the kids too for breakfast even though they didn't come with us."}
{"text":"Excellent Customer Services,  Food really Good ,  I been there twice when its was slow and busy (Sunday)   both time I was very impress with Service and the Food.   I am very critical about Customer Service and Food,  and I have no complaints....  And i highly recommend giving them a try..."}
{"text":"It is a Denny's, so you should know exactly what type of food you are going to get. Is it bad? No, I would say its average, maybe sometimes above average for a chain diner.   From my experiences, the servers and hostesses have always been great. The tables are cleaned up quickly and the bathrooms are pretty well maintained. The food is served fresh and hot. Last time I was there I tried their milkshakes- delicious- and red velvet pancake puppies. After my girl friend and I laughed at how awful the pancake puppies looked, we tasted them and were in heaven. An absolute delight. However, I was sad to see they didn't have their entire Hobbit menu back...  There are a lot of coupons that you can get for your next Denny's trips in the local coupon clippers, online, and even their app. So be sure to keep your eye opened to try and save a buck or two."}
{"text":"Standard Denny's food, which is fine, but the waiter intentionally kept our orders on one ticket.  STUPID!   We told him which people were together.  He kept them together claiming that people forget to pay their bills when they are broken up.  What?  STUPID!  We had to spend a few extra minutes at the counter breaking them up again, and since we didn't arrive together (a half hour apart) we weren't ready to leave together.  It was the end of a long day and I didn't need this one last irritation.  I'm surprised I tipped him.  :-|    Would be 3 stars cuz its what I expect from Denny's food.  Two stars cuz of the STUPID ticket thing."}
{"text":"Nasty place. Got a curly hair in my food. Calling health department for review of establishment"}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars if I could.  The staff is unfriendly and unhappy worst customer service. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"First time I've been here in years and such a disappointment. Supposedly they recently changed management which doesn't sound like its going well. The food was not cooked fully and had flakes of black stuff from the grill. The soda was horrible! They could not get the carbonation right.. Ended up with juice since the soda was so nasty!!!"}
{"text":"I love Denny's..  Prices are higher than  the commercials, since the commercials are US..... But I love it here!   The skillets are awesome, as are the double sandwich with egg.   And I love the dessert bites with dip!   Good food!"}
{"text":"Well, let's see.  WiFi doesn't work.  At all.  The restaurant was freezing cold.  They got rid of my, and all customer's favorite sandwich, the grand slamwich.   So a very bad start indeed.  I ordered a bacon cheddar avocado burger.  And bacon tater tots.  Barely lukewarm.  Seriously there's something wrong with the grill.  Burger had a strange taste, not right.  Something seriously not ok with the grill.  Ordered dulce de leche pancakes with eggs.  Very good, except for the hashbrowns, half cold and terrible taste, just like the burger.  Seriously fix or replace the grill.  Don't know if I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly waitress, good food and portions, very close to the entertainment district with malls, theaters. Perfect to gram a Sunday brunch before heading to a movie."}
{"text":"Pros -ha ha yeah right!!! Cons -staff was horrible (Miss Charmine in particular).  -manager seemed like he really didn't have any real authority in this place.  -food came out completely WRONG. When we questioned Miss Charmine about the situation she acted as if she was completely clueless and proceeded to never returned to our table, not even to check on refilling our cups of water. We seriously had to share water between our party, crazy right?!   My advice is avoid this Denny's at all cost and if I could give them no stars I would.  Our party completely exercised our right to not leave a tip.  By far the worst service I've ever experience and I'm a faithful to the franchise."}
{"text":"The reason for the 2 stars and I'm so upset that I have to do this but maybe after this review this place will get better. We got there and it was at noon lunch time and it was real real busy but we got seated right Away which is great. Our server  was on top of her game she got our drinks right away and took our order right way. While sitting there looking around Omg this place is flirty.  We sat right under an air vent and hoping the air didn't turn on because a huge chunk of dirt would of fell on my meal. All the air vents were pretty caked with dirt it's pretty gross. Window seals need to be wipe down and also chandeliers.  I won't be going back and letting my friends know to eat at your own risk. Please Denny s clean up a little better."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Denny's for many years. This morning we went to this Denny's instead of our \"regular\" Denny's. What a mistake! The entire cast of characters here had the maturity level of a junior high school student. I heard one server say, \"I can't go back to 31 or I'm going to grab his face.\" Another delightful employee said, \"I don't care. I don't care. I'm going to smoke. I don't care.\" These are just two of the quotes I can think of off hand while hearing the servers talk about other customers and the tips they have or have not made throughout my entire Sunday breakfast. In addition my breakfast was terrible. I ordered the grand samwhich with no ham or bacon. Only sausage. There were two crumbs of sausage. That wasn't even the worst part. My bread tasted like French toast. Absolutely disgusting. Honestly I am afraid to ask how everyone else's food was but really that the bigger concern is the entire wait staff's disregard for their customers. While writing this review my fiance just told me that when he went to pay the bill he told the manager how his employees were talking and how upset he was and he didn't say ANYTHING AT ALL. NOT EVEN AN APOLOGY for our horrible experience. I will never go to this Denny's again. If I wanted this kind of breakfast I would have stayed home and watched Jerry springer from the table and had my  11 year old make it. I'm sure it would have tasted better!"}
{"text":"Although waiter was friendly and kept our water glasses full, he seemed uninterested and the food was not so good. The whole place could use a thorough cleaning. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Hello,  We dined at Denny's this week and the manager was kind of rude.  I usually don't complain on reviews because I am in customer service myself, and I'm very understanding.  The food was timely and good  the service was decent but Jen wasn't management material to us. She didn't seem to care about checking tables or running food etc. (call me crazy but that is a manager's job)Right? Sitting by the kitchen of course you see that. But other ppl were busy and to me when servers are busy the manager is there to help. Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"I like this Denny's location. It's in a good neighborhood, although it does draw the usual Denny's crowd. Food is good, plentiful and very reasonably priced. On this particular occasion I went for breakfast. My pancakes were verging on being a pile of charcoal, but the server was very nice and after giving the cook an earful in Spanish, my pancakes were brought out in an edible condition.  Although it did remind me of the French toast scene from \"Road Trip\", but I took my chances and it was good!!!  I will definitely be back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wish I had a choice not to leave even one star.  So great to know that it wasn't just us.  Never, and I mean never have we been treated more rudely.  No acknowledgment when we entered, 15 minutes to be seated.  Waitress didn't even ask us to follow her to the table, just a hand gesture.  On the way to the table we noticed a \"slippery floor\" sign but the floor wasn't wet, just horribly greasy causing my youngest to almost fall.  That's not even the worst part, once at our seat the dead carcasses of flies, spiders and fruit flies littered the window ledges.  We walked out.   Place is a filthy, pig sty."}
{"text":"First. It's freezing in the dining room. Friday night. 85' outside (only because it rained the last few hours) & it's 60 inside. WTF? One of my biggest pet peeves. I don't care if the staff is hot. I don't care if the cooks are hot. Unless they're buying my meal, cater to the customer & not the staff. I'm here on a fundraiser night. Maybe Friday nights are generally slow because the place is basically empty when we walk in but it's getting busier.  C & I were instructed where to sit so we took a booth in that area. The booths around us began filling up until 3/4's of the dining room was full. What a great turnout for Denny's & AYT.  We sat & waited. And waited. And waited. The tables around us weren't waiting. They had already gotten their orders taken. So we waited some more. Now I want to issue a news flash: when the customer still has their menus, it's a strong possibility that they HAVEN'T ordered. Yet the staff kept walking passed our table. I guess we sat at the stealth booth. Eventually Leekai came to take our order. Yipee. I say that sarcastically because her persona was of a VERY disconnected server. I know it's a bummer to have to work. But OMG, look around, do a good job & you stand to make a killing tonight. C got lemonade. I got soda. The lemonade was beyond week. More like lemonwater. C wanted to exchange the \"lemonwater\" for a different drink but Leekai never came back. Eventually C got another server to exchange his drink. C ordered the Sampler duo with Chicken strips and Quesadilla. $5.99. A runner tried to deliver C's food to the table behind us but they turned it down & we stopped her before she had a chance to run off. I guess she was new & hadn't learned the table #'s yet OR Leekai wrote the wrong one down. The Quesadilla was a full Quesadilla cut into 4 wedges and the 2 chicken strips were your average chicken strips. Not a bad deal though for $5.99. C said his food was A-ok.  Freezing dining room. Watered down lemonade. Non existant server. A-ok food. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"Came in to Denny's at approximately 130 in the morning thinking that we were going to have hot food waited 30 minutes and the food came out Cole we asked for saut√© vegetables and they sent out cold  boil vegetables hamburger cold french fries cold broccoli cold all of the hot food that was supposed to be hot was cold extremely terrible service do not come here run for your life it should be no stars -5 stars"}
{"text":"I like Denny's, but this location was awful. It's horribly crowded, service is slow due to crowding and the staff are rude, the hostess to be particular (I know they deal with a lot of jerks all day long, but no need to be rude to me when I'm being nice to you). Not to mention, they made us wait twice as long as they said to get a table. We even saw tables open up and the hostess skipped over us a few times to put people further down on the list in those tables, really shady.  However: Two thumbs up for the cheap value breakfasts...$2, $4 & $6!  Tip: If your party is larger than 4, split up and you'll get a table faster.  Overall: I would only go here if there was no wait. If there was a wait, I would head on over to the restaurant called \"America\" in New York, NY hotel...it's just like a Denny's/Red Robin. The restaurant is massive and you can always get in without waiting, good service...and their portions are HUGE."}
{"text":"So....typical Denny's I guess.  This location's decor is really nice and new-looking.  I like to drop in on Denny's for their build-your-own-burger with the veggie patty since I can make a vegan burger from there.  My order was quite simple and I think there were only maybe five other tables, at most, in the entire restaurant.  Two servers were on the floor and of course the kitchen staff.  Here's where the breakdown happened.    What I ordered: water, veggie burger with lettuce, tomato and saut√©ed onions on a whole wheat bun.    What I got: veggie burger with lettuce, tomato and saut√©ed onions on a SESAME SEED BUN.  No water.  Just food with the wrong bun.   I understand mistakes happen however, water should be the first thing to hit the table.  When the server brought the food, she realized, apologized and slowly got the water.  Make no mistake, everyone I encountered on staff was extremely nice.  When you're thirsty, nice doesn't matter much.  My glass got to less than half and still had some food left but never had an opportunity to get a refill since no one came around for long periods of time to check on me.  I had one walking-past check in: \"you alright?\" and that was it.  I was ok at that point but at least one more stop by later I would have gotten a refill on water.  I didn't have to wait long for the check, that seemed to appear quite quickly.  Anyway, I may decide to come back here just to get my guilty pleasure on but I'm bringing my own water this time, thank you very little."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and had a great experience. They were not busy and the service was excellent. We were seated right away and our server was quick and friendly. He made sure our drinks were refilled promptly and our food was good.   We had the bourbon burger and the prime rib Cobb salad."}
{"text":"This is the nicest Denny's I have ever been to! It wasn't really busy so that was nice and the food came out fairly quickly. The waiter was very attentive and it was an overall good experience."}
{"text":"Not sure what the attitude problem is with the manager who was doubling as host at this restaurant. There were maybe 5 groups waiting to be seated at this time and we still waited 45 minutes to get seated. We watched as several groups were seated ahead of us. And when we confronted this poor excuse for a manager he got argumentative in the middle of the restaurant and claimed he had called us before. I'm not sure how you miss us when there weren't that many people waiting in he first place.  Apparently this is a regular event with this man. The server informed us he is often argumentative with customers."}
{"text":"Arrived here  after leaving a club this past weekend between 2:00 or 3:00 am. We were seated promptly and our waiter was okay, but a little too friendly (he felt like he could join me at our booth and due to the way that I was seated, he sat too close to me for comfort.) However, this place is dirty! While we were there an employee began mopping with the smelliest mop water. It literally made me sick to my stomach so I mentioned it to the waiter who insisted that the smell was coming from outside. As the smell only got worse, I mentioned it to the manager who seated us and he made the employee change the water. When our food came out, it was not hot and the silverware was so filthy that we had to request plastic. The only good thing that came out of our visit to this place was the free grand slam that my best friend received due to it being her birthday. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food! Hands down the raddest Denny's I have ever been to! The restaurant was clean, the food looked and tastes fantastic, and our server Don was super personable! We will definitely be making this our hang out spot! A++"}
{"text":"Waited and waited and waited.  No acknowledgment, wasn't busy, ... After half hour we left.  As did several others."}
{"text":"I love this place. Kayla is a great waitress. Soda and coffees always filled. Our order taken right away. Food arrived very timely. And delicious!!"}
{"text":"The costumer service here was horrible. Never brought us our drinks until we had to ask our server \"Lonika\" for our drinks. We didn't get our food until 40 minutes after we had ordered. Last time I'll be coming to this Denny's. If I had the option to rate this a 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the workers were rude and not helpful. They also gave us raw meat after asking for medium well."}
{"text":"Awesome waitress.   Great suggestive selling.  Manager was a cool guy and very attentive to the guest i observed.       Jasz.   Napa :)"}
{"text":"I can sympathize with our waitress-- we had a party of seven, but for a restaurant that was clearly not packed to the gills, we had a pretty bad experience here. We sat in a very secluded part of the restaurant, which would have been nice had there not been a giant sign that we all had to squeeze past in the middle of the entrance way. Even the manager seemed to ignore its inconvenience when he had to scoot past it himself while seating us, it remained there... the whole time. I'm not claiming to be an expert on restaurant safety, but I'm a decent percentage sure that sign was a big ol' fire hazard.  After waiting nearly 30 minutes, our server came for our drink order and was fairly curt about it. She seemed annoyed that she had to prompt each of us when it was our turn to speak, because we had manners and didn't want to overwhelm her by speaking out of turn. Regardless, we all received our drinks and a metric butt ton of extra straws.  Despite the nearly hour wait for diner food, it all came out great-- except for mine. Wouldn't you know, the one who writes the Yelp reviews gets the tripped up order. I ordered an avocado chicken Caesar salad. It came out without dressing, so I asked if I could have some, and she asked me what kind. When I replied with the obvious \"Caesar,\" she rolled her eyes and asked me if I wanted a refill too. When I handed her my cup, she stared at me... like I had the clairvoyance to know that she wanted me to take my straw out of the cup so I could save it-- DESPITE THE FACT that she had dumped about ten extra straws on our table an hour earlier. I assumed I was covered for my next refill.  \"Take your straw,\" she said. So I did.   All in all, the food was satisfying and the place was as clean as you'd expect a Denny's to be. I was glad to, once again, scoot past the fire hazard of a sign, and get myself out of that front door.   My advice? Order to-go."}
{"text":"This restaurant has very poor customer service and food. They gave us tinfoil to wrap our left overs."}
{"text":"I get the same breakfast in any Denny's that I go to. The server seemed as if she wasn't interested in being at work. The cooks obviously weren't. My pancakes were so dry and tasteless that I had to return them and go with the English muffins. The muffins always come with butter, but of course, mine did not. There was no jelly at my table, nor the surrounding tables. The grits were cold. There were other things, but it has been two weeks and I forgot. I mostly remember that on that day, I decided that I would never return to that location."}
{"text":"I never thought that I would be reviewing Denny's but why not. IF you're not looking for the local flavor and you're ok with a chain...there is no better place to go for a good, inexpensive breakfast. They have delicious pancakes. They make eggs just the way that you order them. They have great choices if you're watching your calories. AND...they are the only place that I know of that serve grits. The grits are not too soupy either. The service at this Denny's is fast and the servers are attentive and professional. Definitely worth a visit when all of the local restaurants are too crowded with long wait lines."}
{"text":"In the last 2yrs of living in Vegas I try and give this location a chance every few months because I live the view. However, every single times the staff has been lazy in service and the running of their business is chatioc. This trip I waited 10mins before getting a manager just to be sat at a table, then I waited 5mins for a busser to offer a drink. Followed by a 10 wait for server to order food. I will give my server Ashley credit for picking my table up. I am out of her section and she had noticed how long I was waiting and decided to take me ontop of the 2 large parties she has in her section."}
{"text":"This Denny's is truly a disappointment! I used to live in Arizona, where Denny's was always a great place to eat. Unfortunately, the people at location do not hold themselves to the same high standard.  First of all, my boyfriend and I noticed that there were only two other tables with people when we went in, so none of the problems were due to them being busy. The service was absolutely terrible! The waiter never refilled our drinks, and he only brought them to us 20 minutes after we ordered them. We saw him 3 times total: when he took our drink order, when he brought us our drinks and took our food order at the same time, and when he brought us our food and told us he was going on a 5 minute break. He never came back. Another server was supposed to come wait on us, but he only stopped at the table to drop off the bill. Our food took nearly an hour to arrive, and when it did, the quality was poor-and we both had ordered burgers, so it should not have been difficult to make them taste at least decent, and it certainly should not have taken so long.  To top it all off, we saw a woman come in, and she was apparently visiting her boyfriend on his shift. She went behind the bar/counter area to make out with him, and then walked back into the kitchen with him! I cannot believe that they allow random people to just go wherever they want! This must be a health code violation. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Buffalo style chicken strips appetizers and garden side salad, DELICIOUS! always take out, way better then trying to order it at Buffalo Wild Wings.  Kinda healthy but not really but it's ok cuz it's so good."}
{"text":"Oh yeah it's good come eat k bye. Anna wanted chicken and waffles but they didn't have it so she decided to go with with waffle solo instead. What a rebel, maybe that's why I love her"}
{"text":"Upon arrival at this location, a man sitting on the floor behind the register wished me good morning and we exchanged pleasantries. I did find it odd that he didn't get up to greet a customer, but seated myself at his direction. As I moved through the restaurant, there were no clean tables...all were covered with dishes and food. I finally found one that was partially clean. I then had Anna come over with a menu and a rush to get my order. I did ask for water and a few moments. I got the water and that was it for at least 15 minutes. It was not overly busy, but staff were finally scrambling to clean tables from what may have been an early morning rush. Approximately 20 minutes after my arrival, my order was finally taken in passing but never written down. I watched other patrons come in, get seated, order, and have food delivered to their tables and still I waited. About 45 minutes after my arrival, I elected to leave. I spoke with the manager who seemed to be stricken speechless by the story, even though she had spoken to me earlier in the visit. No apology offered. No explanation offered. I will not return.  I was able to drive to an IHOP five minutes away and had a breakfast in front of me within 10 minutes of entering the front door."}
{"text":"Got off of work at 4:30 am placed my order for take out,got there around 4:40.got the same waiter I got last week,nice guy I might say.i think his name was sabino,very friendly guy.greeted me as soon as I stepped into dennys,he recognized me I guess.he had my chicken fajita/season fries I ordered ready on the table,still fresh from the grill.total came out to $11.87 not bad for the amount of food I got,plus awesome company.i guess it was slow at this time,so sabrino came by to chit chat and see if I needed anything.anyways guess I found my new breakfast joint."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. I didn't expect much. But this had to be the best Denny's I've ever been to.  Good food, great service, friendly people. Signage to get in was nonexistent.  They actually have free valet parking!  If you need to get a fast, quick meal, this is the place."}
{"text":"Don't know what is there to say about Denny's...\"the only thing open past 2 am\" pretty much sums it up.  Everything is as expected....a plate of blah with a hint of blah...but I've been here quite often so i don;t know what that says about me lol!    But lately Denny's has been the stickiest of the icky! I think Angelo T. getting a a fat slice of raw chicken burger is what sealed the deal for me.  If your in dire need of late night sustenance I suggest heading down to China town or Sun's on centre street....but if your not feeling late night Asian cuisine at the moment why not whip up your own American Slam breakfast at home cause i guarantee it will outdo Denny's on the best of days!  Peace brother!"}
{"text":"I love Denny's, especially their zesty nachos and cheese fries BUT this location is horrible. I recommend coming here during the day, not at night. Seems like the night crew is lazy. Food is always cold/old and their waiters don't care to notice."}
{"text":"Fast service, good manager checking in on tables and clean bathrooms. All around a good experience for a quick affordable breakfast with a table full of teens. Will be back next time."}
{"text":"I waited for 20 minutes to be waited on. Finally I threw out $20 to the employees who were ignoring me and said that anyone willing to help would get the money. Finally a manager waited on us while the surrounding staff glared at us."}
{"text":"Denny's has been open for a while now at this location and the anticipation of this chain restaurant from the US was huge.  It's safe to say now that the hype did not follow Denny's to Canada. It's just ok.  Our first choice was Mcdonalds but the parking lot was a mess so Denny's was the second choice.  Came here for a very late weekend evening and it was PACKED.  If it wasn't for our waiter Felix this review would've definitely been a 2 star, shoutouts to him.  In a nutshell, it took 1 hour to complete ordering, 15 minute to finish eating and then another 30 minutes to wrap everything up.  With Denny's being a 24-hour breakfast destination, go if you must but don't be prepared to be blown away."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The food was bad the eggs were not good! They weren't even made correctly the environment was very very bad .. Never coming here again! Don't come! I do not recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"This place gets worse every time we come here.  Today while we were seated right away, the service was sooooo slow.  Waiting almost 55 minutes for our food.  Unacceptable.    When the food eventually got to our table, some were hit, but most were lukewarm.  If I wasn't so hungry I would have sent it back.  Will not going to return! :("}
{"text":"Why did we ever stop going to Denny's? I remember going when I was younger and after a night out with friends. We pay three times as much for fancy restaurants that may or may not have an exotic item on the menu and receive lack luster quality. I stopped in last night after going to the movies. I had a delightful meal, with fast, friendly service, prepared exactly as I requested in a clean, quiet, well designed, comfortable restaurant. I sat back and asked myself, why I have not been back in such a long time? This restaurant needs to be revisited. Thank you for reminding me of something I had enjoyed before."}
{"text":"Came in with my pregnant wife, was seated and then proceeded to watch to other groups order without a waiter even acknowledging us. I finally got up to ask the hostess if someone would take out order. She took another five minutes. We decided to leave. She then gave us the worst apology ever as she walked away."}
{"text":"My sister loves this place as her \"go to hangover let me tell what I did last night place\" lol. I recommend the ice coffee it's really good and they actually have fresh made by request espresso!!!! It was pretty clean and it's a new location. It has plenty of TVS and it's very wheelchair or stroller friendly. They do have a little Togo cafe for coffee and bread snacks. Check in on Yelp for 15% off! I had a few bites of my sisters eggs and grits and hash brown all pretty good. Don't go there if you are on a diet or cutting carbs! Everything has grease but in a \"good I don't care I will wear stretchy pants way\"."}
{"text":"It is Denny's so you know what you are getting. Food is mediocre and well.......Denny's diner.  That being said, the place is clean, the servers are ok and our food was hot.   Sometimes, don't you just want a skillet breakfast smothered in gravy for dinner?   You know you do!   When that mood strikes, this Denny's can fit the bill."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute worst service ever. I ordered food and only half of my plate had barely any food maybe a few bites. The coffee cups had some slimy clear liquid on it. And when I did say something everyone as far as the staff was whispering about us. The worst place I've ever experienced. I would give this place so many negative stars if I could. Please never come here. Go anywhere else and spend a few extra dollars. Please please please."}
{"text":"Food was average, service was slow however. Wasn't busy, 930 AM, maybe 7 tables active, but service was slow. Waitress was nice. Food was average. Would return."}
{"text":"I usually don't write yelp reviews unless someone has really done me wrong. I came in with a group of 12, which is understandably overwhelming and they had several other large groups there so all of us who work in the food service industry understood and were happy to wait. The table didn't have silverware at all, which should have been the first clue that something was going to be bad. We got there at 9:30 pm and it took until 10:00pm to get someone to even pay attention to our table. The section we were in only had about 3 tables in it, the other two tables sat down after us, got their food, and finished eating as we were getting our drink orders taken. We all agreed, we'd make it very clear what we want right away, we wouldn't order anything complicated and just generally try to make these late night workers lives easier. The guy comes over, and is immediately rude, his name was Sean, RIP if you have Sean as your waiter. He comments on all our orders like its the wrong thing to order or its like \"oh wow you're going to be eating /that/\" but, I can put that aside because sometimes things come across differently than intended. Our drink orders, which was 7 waters, 2 decaf coffees, 1 sprite, 1 apple juice and 1 iced tea, took 40 minutes to get out for us. Our food came out first come first serve... as in 3 people got their food and finished it before anyone else got their food. They forgot 3 people's orders and we consistently tried to flag ANYONE down. The bus girl was more helpful than our actual server, I wish I had her name tag I would have praised the living shit out of her. Like I said earlier, we came it at 9:30pm and some people just started to leave because it was taking so long, myself included. The meal turned out to be around 2 hours. Mind you, we've been to a Denny's on any other part of town with groups of 24 and our service was better then than it was today. Just to put the icing on the cake, the manager checked me out and I had said \"We're on all separate checks\" before he took the drink orders however, it took the manager about 10 additional minutes to check me out, because he was too busy flirting with the girl in front of me. And then when I told him, \"Some people still haven't gotten their food, this is ridiculous,\" he just shrugs and says \"okay\". Out of the 12 of us, 9 of us had worked in the food service or comparable industry and we were all in shock that this type of service goes on. If you're there for late night, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"When Fernando used to work there, the place was clean and the food was delicious and always hot. Now it seems like the staff doesn't care, you may or may not get a refill. Your server won't check on you. I waited forever for someone to take our order and our server, tyni, kept going mia. When we finally got our food my club was soggy and my fries were cold. Low and behold there was also a hair. So I quickly pushed it away and my bf and i tried flagging down our server with no avail. Finally another server came over and took care of the issue THEN our server came over asking if i want it remade. Uh- if you would have taken care of it you would've known I lost my appetite. Just horrible. She was also very condescending. And then to make it better the manager NEVER came over just looked from the other side of the restaurant. Sucks because We used to come here all the time, now we won't be back."}
{"text":"We were there around 10 pm. We had great service and good food. Nice experience at this Denny's."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this Denny's location. I was eating with 3 friends & we all ordered Belgian waffles. 40 minutes passed with no food & other tables that we had arrived before already received their food. We flagged down a manager to ask the status of our food & she says she'll check. She comes back & states it's not ready yet. No further explanation. When we questioned why all of the other tables that we had arrived prior to received their food already, she says with a sarcastic attitude, \"all I can say is your food isn't ready\" and walks away.   Refusing to be treated that way, we get up and leave. As we leave she smiles and says sarcastically \"have a nice day.\" My friend turns, smiles, and says \"you too.\" And she proceeded to tell us to \"fuck off.\"   Manager had blonde/red hair and had a tattoo sleeve.   Will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the service is iffy. Sometimes great sometimes not.. But today.. The service sucked. Our server started out as Albamez (?). She was rude, and so slow. There were literally THREE TABLES being occupied. The other two had their food already. We did not. For some reason she literally ignored us. I asked for a bowl of lemons. She brought me 3 on my water not a big deal, I ask for a bowl again. She mumbles, obviously irritated, just give me a second. Doesn't even look at me or apologize. This is her job. Tired or not, I expect respect. As I'm sure she would had the roles been reversed. Now on the other hand Tyesha (our server for the second half) was phenomenal. She was new and I swear she did more than anyone in the building. If you can, request her. She will take care of you much better than the rest.   THE FOOD  The food is unlike the service. For the most part it's always pretty good. That's probably why I keep coming back. That and it's close and cheap.   IN CONCLUSION  If you want a quick bite to eat for little money, this is your place. If you want even an attempt at acceptable customer service then you should keep driving."}
{"text":"The worst! Yes, I get it. It's busy on the strip, and it's only Dennys. But this was the worst place to try to get a cheap meal on the strip. The service was horrible. You can wait twenty minutes after being seated before anyone even comes to ask if you need anything. Better order food at the same time or it could be another long wait.   After we ordered we never saw our waitress again, the manager brought out or food that had been sitting under the heat lamp for some time. I never did get my complete order and am still waiting in that second iced tea.   This is the first time we refused to tip anyone. Won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I'm here on a Saturday morning and it's packed... but just a 5 minute wait. There were no booths available, just tables. I didn't want to wait so I accepted sitting at a middle table. Hunger can't be choosy. The waitress was nice and took my order in a non-rushing manner. I ordered the \"build your own slam\" just with wheat banana pecan pancakes instead of the regular buttermilk ones. Too fluffy in my book. My order came out promptly after I ordered. Took around 10 minutes to get my food and that's odd since they were specialty pancakes and it being so busy. I was very satisfied. Food was good and I have nothing to complain about. My waitress was always around and never too far away if I needed her. In all I spent about $10 bucks total and left with a full tummy."}
{"text":"First of all, the service is horrible! The waiters never come to you unless you make eye contact and basically make it seem like you need something.  The food is okay, pretty pricey for breakfast! The eggs and sausages were well done and tasted really good. Portions were small. Two stars only because the food was good and the place was pretty clean, however I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"It was about 5 o'clock in the morning and I had been up since about 4AM. I just flew back from Europe so my internal clock was still on European time. Where can you go for breakfast that early in the morning?  The answer is, of course, Denny's. Open 24/7. Classic American breakfast place. I think the first time I ate at Denny's was about 1978.  I grabbed a seat in a booth and ordered the classic American breakfast, the Original Grand Slam--two pancakes, two eggs sunny side up, two bacons, two sausages. It was exactly what I expected, the same as it has been since 1978. No reason change a good thing.  A lone waitress was running the whole place--greeting customers, taking orders, delivering the food, re-filling coffee, bussing tables and working the cash register. A busy gal, she was friendly and very efficient. Always on the ball with coffee re-fills.  Total damage was $11.40 including tax and tip. Good value. Like Arnold said. \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. My friends and I came here at 12:20am, and there's only one server. Which is no problem to me bc I am a waitress as well and I know sometimes 1 server can handle smaller restaurants when it's not during peak hours. But wow, was I wrong. Our female server just did everything sooooo slow. She took our drinks late, our order late, everything. The way she prioritized the order of the things she needs to do was just terrible. Halfway through my meal (bacon slam burger & chicken tenders were delicious tho! Thanks to the cook), I needed another sauce of honey mustard. She only checked on our table ONCE and I asked for my extra cup of honey mustard & refills for our waters. Then she goes to the register to process a LARGE party who has multiple checks first before she gets us our simple water refills & sauce. That took about 15 mins, so by the time she came back w/ our stuff, my chicken tenders were cold already and my 2 other friends has already finished their meals (lumberjack slam & Belgian waffle slam). Ugh I've never written a review let alone had such bad service that I had to write my first one. Such horrible service. Management, please train your servers to be better."}
{"text":"This is the best Denny's I have ever been to. Our food was great and out waitress made our experience even better. Angie was our serving  and I've never had such a nice and caring and cool server. She actually talked with me and my wife and not just tack order and give use our food and leave .great service great food great hospitality. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Just ordered food for pickup and bought a build your own grand slam.  We can home and they forgot the 2 pancakes that came with it. This time they didn't even give up any syrups as well.   Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm glad this particular Denny's is closed. I remember going there about a year ago with my folks for lunch. we'd just gotten out of church and decided to eat out instead of rushing home for lunch.   The waitress that took our orders made fun of my Pennsylvania accent . Then she went away for twenty minutes.  She finally came back with our coffee and water. She took our food orders rather arrogantly and disappeared again for almost an hour.   Our food arrived and were appalled  at its quality. The cheese burger I ordered was dripping with grease and oil, the fries were crunchy rather than crispy, My mother's soup was cold and watered down. My father's sausage and biscuits w/ gravy were a lumpy blob of goo.  The manager offered to comp us another meal but his attitude about it was condescending and arrogant. I know it's been years since my folks and I have been to a Denny's but if this is how all of them treat customers and their orders, I will never go to another one. And I havent been to one since."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest Denny's I have ever been in. It's very updated, clean, good staff, quick and efficient service. And the food was really good. The kitchen is very clean as well!"}
{"text":"I did not like the customer service here today. Came in around 2ish, and it was empty. Less than 10 people. And the sign says \"Please wait to be seated\" so my family and I waited and waited. Waiters passed by without saying anything. So I had to ask if we could just seat ourselves! We did. No one brought us a menu! We had to ask for it! Seriously it wasn't even busy. I gave a 2 stars because the food wasn't bad.   Step up on your customer service!!"}
{"text":"Visited this morning and service was stellar. Kudos to our male server Jacky, who was outstanding. We arrived at 9:45am and were seated right away (amazing for a Sunday). We ordered and food was in front of us in about 10 minutes. Great portion size for the price. New buttermilk pancakes tasted great, although their syrup is way too sweet for my liking.  We were seated in a booth in an area that was very cool (the air blew across the ceiling and down the wall). As we were next to the wall...it blew on us and was quite cool...so much so that our food cooled faster than it should have. This was the only hic-cup in our visit. Huge improvement.....great service, great food, great turnover of tables."}
{"text":"Denny's is great restaurant. I really enjoyed the food and the service was fantastic. The only thing that was not so good was how long our food took to get to us."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast. I ordered a grand slam for $8. I asked for my eggs scrambled well with cheese and veggie blend, hashbrowns fried hard, all bacon and a side of toast and extra butter. So after waiting like 20 mins for my food in the not so crowded restaurant my husbands food comes and so does my eggs bacon toast and hashbrowns, the waitress says your pancakes will be out in a few minutes. Strike 1, then i look at the hashbrowns on my plate and they are barely even brown, even my husband who is not a complainer said his were a wayyy on the light side but he'd eat them. I sent mines back and about 10 mins after brought me some nicely fried hashbrowns and my pancakes, by this time the rest of my food was gone and who wanta to just eat pancakes and hashbrowns alone. My husband coyldnt finish his hashbrowns bc he said they were RAW. The service was OKAY nothing to tip for but we tipped anyways."}
{"text":"Friendly environment, what can I say? Food is great, service is great, staff is great, makes a Denny's complete!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was outdated and needs remodeling on the inside. Food was sub par and didn't thrill me. Long wait time for food to arrive even though there  weren't many customers. They seem short staffed. Seems a cheap quality diner. Don't recommend this particular location. I've been to other Denny's (the one on Day Drive in Parma) and it was much better. I guess it depends on the management."}
{"text":"-----------------------This review has been recently Edited by the original poster on  9/24/2017 from it's original post of 2/19/2016------------------------.  so after a long hiatus from this Denny's because of an incredibly rude worker and terrible food, i decided it was time to go settle with the manager at this Denny's. when i walked into this establishment, it was like an entirely new venue.   \"so what's a face lift?\" i hear you asking, and i usually would be the first one to agree with that sentiment. a face lift is nothing without the service improving, as well as the food and cleanliness of the Restaurant. well i can tell you right now, someone between my initial complaint and 1 star review, and sometime recently cleaned house in every facet of that word.   Food was A+ and my group as well as myself order quite a bit of it. the consistency, the flavor, and the portions of every meal were completely spot on, everyone was happy even the pickiest of the eaters.   Cleanliness was A+ as well. the bathrooms especially were well cleaned, well stocked, and the floor didn't stick to my shoes like it was in previous encounters. the tables, the silverware, the glasses, EVERYTHING was spotless and precisely taken care of.  Bonus: the atmosphere in this Denny's is like being at a real Diner again. good music, great energy, and everyone was   the one thing though, that got this restaurant a five star bill from someone as skeptical and usually harsh as myself? the service. the manager especially greeted me with a handshake and a thank you for coming back. the servers, and i mean every single one that i asked a question of, or even just in passing, had a smile and asked me if i needed anything. this is complete contrast to before where getting service from 90% of the staff that was there, was like pulling teeth. also, wouldn't you know the one server i had a major problem with because of her disgusting attitude and appearance, has since been let go and told not to inquire with them again.   Thank you to this Denny's, and all it's staff for being above all expectations! we will absolutely be coming back, and recommending to everyone i know."}
{"text":"We came here for a late breakfast. The place was busy on a Wednesday morning, I was surprised. Anyhow, the food and customer services were ok. We both had Triple Bacon Samplers and the food was good. The new Lemon Rashberry was really good. The service was slow but I wasn't in hurry so, I didn't mind."}
{"text":"Denny's is just fun at 3am.  The food tastes great and you always see colorful characters.  It's cheap too."}
{"text":"Denny's has great prices and decent service. This location has good parking and is close to where I live. Keep in mind there is also a Waffle House and Cracker Barrell basically next door so they need to stay on their game to compete.  Denny's is a franchise and nothing is very unique about this location. But they do it right so they get 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's.  It's what you expect.  Cheap food.  But this location is good because the building is clean and in good shape.  Service is usually decent too.  Probably one of the best places to come for breakfast in North Phoenix, if not because it is one of the only places to come."}
{"text":"We just drove in from San Diego and since we were hungry we decided to go to Denny's. Just had one of the worse experiences at Denny's and unfortunately it happens to be the one in Vegas. Came in tonight with four other friends. It is Wednesday at 3:30am. There isn't very many people here. The waitress was friendly and took our order in what seemed to be an efficient manner. Our orders were simple, my order was the easiest. Pancakes, scrambled eggs and bacon strips. Well done. Fast forward 45 minutes later still no food. The waitress checked in and said food would be shortly. At this point we're now really tired and beginning to lose our appetite. Food finally comes out about 5 minutes later. All my friends get their food except for me. I'm thinking ok, maybe my order will be out next. Nope. The waitress comes back about 2 minutes later and I ask her to please cancel my order. She said \"Oh, what are you missing?\" I look down in front of me and smiling I say, I never got my food. She apologizes and let's me know she will take it off the bill. She ended up also not charging me for my milk that I order and I do appreciate that. Won't be back though."}
{"text":"Went here twice while on vacation. Friendly and Great wait staff. Lumberjack Slam and Iced Tea hit the spot after 4 Wheeling in 115 degree weather in the desert."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for Denny's to open up for the longest time. After all the hype, I came here for dinner after a long flight in February. The restaurant was impeccably clean given that it had only been open for a couple of weeks at that point. It even has USB ports to charge your mobile devices!  We ordered the moons over my hammy and the quesadilla and chicken strips. I thought that the home fries that comes with the moons over my hammy were too salty. The ham in the moons over my hammy were too sweet. The quesadilla and chicken strips were better, but the quesadilla itself was also a little salty. Hopefully these were only problems with the initial launch and the food is prepared better over time. The service, on the other hand, was really good."}
{"text":"Horrible !! if I COULD give -10 I would.. super Racist people if you are not Mexican they don't care about you. It took 30 to be seated while parties of the same amount o people were seated and they came after us, but of course they were Hispanic. After we were seated our food took forever (50 min)... their excuse was it was chicken and it takes a while to cook... while other people who was seated after us got te same plate and quicker. Don't get me wrong we are Hispanic but we don't look Hispanic and listing to the manager with the servers talk shit about us, was disgusting... this people should deserve to even have job"}
{"text":"Great place to eat that is close to home.  Servers are mostly very experienced and work hard at keeping customers happy.  Later at night they are sometimes understaffed but have patience and smile.  They have probably had a long day and the food is worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"Our waiter was MIA throughout our entire time at the restaurant. Never brought any refills on drinks to our party of 8. Our food and drink orders were brought incorrectly and incompletely. We spoke to the manager several times, and it took three complaints for him to come to our table. The entrance to the bathroom was greasy and one of our party members had to catch herself falling twice. Let me point out that this is a Wednesday morning, and the waiter to customer ratio is no excuse to our crap service. Had to switch servers half way through our meal, where service slightly improved."}
{"text":"Denny's is and always will be my favorite diner to run to whenever I want to eat breakfast for dinner. Their milkshakes here are fantabulous! Creamy and delicious. Just the way I expect them to be! They also have a variety of items on their menu, so if you feel like eating a cheeseburger for breakfast? Go right ahead! There are no rules here!   The only reason why I didn't give them five stars is because of their service. It's never consistent. I remember they took forever just to give us a menu. I'd say we were waiting for about 10-15 minutes just so we can get someone's attention and a server to give us a menu. Finally, along came Mimi! She has got to be my favorite waitress here. Not because we share the same name but because she's super sweet and very accommodating. She turned my rocky beginning into a very happy ending!  Would I come back even though their service is kind of on the poor side? Yes! Just as long as I don't meet any rude servers here, I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Love this place. It will forever hold a special place in my heart. My husband & I had our wedding reception here on 2/14/16. It sounds Crazy to have a wedding reception here, but everyone loved it. It was one of the best days of my life. Thank you to all the dennys staff that made my day extra special. Great food & service. My guest were very impressed. Also parking is conveniently located right under the restaurant. THANK YOU!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sure there are still those who go to Denny's for the down-home comfort. None of those people use Yelp.  For the rest of us, Denny's is where we go with our goofy friends late at night when we're feeling slap-happy. Denny's is kitschy fun, a parody of itself. But we still respect it in the morning, because it doesn't try to be ironic.   What elevates this particular location to transcendent heights of camp?   It's owned by a sex shop.  YES.  It's owned by Lions Den.   Knowing this, every meal at this Denny's will taste better. The juvenile jokes that are a staple of late-night diner runs will be even more tasteless. You will be unable to look at any of the servers or patrons without thinking: \"Oh my god. Do they know? Should I tell them? Did she used to do porn?\"  It's still the same Denny's as every other Denny's. But better, because you have a dirty mind."}
{"text":"It's a Dennys what can you say that you already don't know.  Perfect after a night of drinking and great for breakfast at affordable prices.  This spot is clean with good service,  not to big as others I've been to but doesn't get to packed either."}
{"text":"First dennys I've seen with a patio. Good costumer service fast.  Typical food you can get at any other one. Breakfast always hits the spot when coming to dennys. The inside is clean but a little clustered with seating close to everyone."}
{"text":"Anybody who tells you that Vegas is a 24 hour town, is either lying or hasn't tried to find a non-poker bar to eat at, on a Sunday, after 10 PM, off of the Strip. It's damn near impossible to find any place open.   Just like last Sunday, Jerry J. and I were on the prowl  last night (7/31/11) for some food to celebrate having one whole day this week, off from work today (Monday.) After driving home from work and getting picked up, Jerry suggested that we drive down by where he lives (Sunset Station) rather than by where I live (GVR) - there was nothing open, the cafe inside of Sunset was closed until 6 AM for cleaning and for whatever reason, Jerry doesn't think it's okay to take girls to bars for a proper meal. The only option was Denny's or IHOP over there and he said he didn't care for either, so we drove back up to GVR. Everything was closed there, so we ended up at Denny's on Eastern. Eff. We drove around for an hour for nothing!  The place was pretty dead at a little after midnight. There was only two tables that had people at them. We got the menus and... Jerry said nothing was jumping out to him. I'm not a big fan of Denny's - their food isn't very good anymore, so I agreed. They have some new menu out that has \"regional\" dishes and I was really eyeing the shrimp and grits. All of the sudden, common sense took over as I pondered how good the quality of seafood, at a Denny's, in a desert would be, and that the grits probably were of the instant variety. The waitress had to check on us three times before we were ready to order because we were too busy chatting to look over our menu. Good thing she was patient with us. When it was time, Jerry ordered a burger and fries, and I settled on the peach french toast, with two sunny side eggs, 2 sausage links and hash browns for $5.99   The food came out quickly. My toast, and what I think were canned peaches, were a little black on the edges, but it was okay. The eggs were not good - they had a thick, congealed, clear layer on top - something I've never seen on eggs I've made sunny side up at home. They weren't good quality and they tasted...not good. You can tell the quality of an egg - the better the quality, the more orange the yolk. Of course, quality eggs come from chickens that were fed bugs and worms and quality feed and were allowed to scratch around outside. These yolks were highlighter-yellow and tasteless. Poor chickens.    I don't think Jerry was that impressed with his food. The meal was pretty blah for both of us, but we were there over an hour. The waitress was good, but that's about it. Skip this place and just go to the grocery store if you need food on a late Sunday night because Denny's won't hit the spot."}
{"text":"We stopped in here the other morning for breakfast  It wasn't too bad. Food was served hot and correct   The reason for a 3 star is our server forgot one order of pancakes and we were half way finished before we got her attention to bring them out  Place wasn't the cleanest either   Not sure if we would come back to this location or not"}
{"text":"Can i give no stars? Waited 15 minutes to be seated. Clearly at least 10 open tables. Waited 15 minutes for drinks and another 10 to order. Food came out relatively fast. My eggs were raw, french toast was cold and petrified. The kids food was good. Server came over i told her i didnt want the food. Asked for drink refills didnt get. Manager came over i told her my food was raw/cold and we could really use some drink refills. Still didnt get any. She said ok and walked away. Server brought check. My food wasnt taken off. Waited 15 more minutes in line to pay bill. The manager was now working register and told me she'd \"comp\" my meal on the bill. I would hope so, i didnt eat it) she ran my credit card and told me she couldnt give me a reciept. Told her i wasnt leaving without one. Magically she reprinted. Handed it to me and told me to \"get out\". Nice huh?  Funny enough the reciept had the 888 numbers to talk about your visit and the website info. I complained to anyone that would listen  I've never been treated that way at a restaurant. Poor kids tryin to wait tables need a strong leader and that chick wasn't it. I'd starve to death before stepping into that location again."}
{"text":"After many bad dine in experience at this restaurant, we decided to order take out instead.  Went to pick up the food. Stood there for more than 10 minutes before anyone would acknowledged me.  Then when they found out it was for pick up, they started sitting the dine in customers who came in after me again and again before I had to stop them and said \"hey, I don't have all day.  The food is sitting right there behind you.\" We won't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"This is one of our weekday go to breakfast spots always opting for something on the $2, $4, $6 menu.  Never a problem with service as Edgar has taken good care of us for several years."}
{"text":"We walked in at approximately 6:15pm to an almost empty restaurant. There was probably only 2 to 3 tables being occupied upon our arrival. My family of three stood at the podium and patiently waited to be addressed by an employee, which was somewhat difficult since there were none to be seen. The first to appear was a gentleman, whom i assumed was a busser by the way he was attired and the dingy appearance of his uniform. It took him several moments to acknowledge us from his tasks behind the restaurants bar seating area. He shouted that someone would be with us shortly. Upon Que, an oriental waitress appeared form the kitchen area and addressed us.She was pleasant in her greeting and asked if we preferred to be seated in a booth or a table.We chose a booth from the wide range of options.   She took our drink order immediately upon seating and let us know to take our time deciding with our menu selections and to flag her down once we had finalized our selections. A few moments had passed once we had decided and i began to observe what was going on around us in the restaurant. Our waitress was now acting as the cashier, with the assistance of the \"busser\". There must have been an issue with a transition because a manager appeared from her post somewhere in the back. During my entire meal, these were the only three employees for which i visually saw, i can assume that there was probably a cook as well in the back. We waited for several more minutes before our waitress was able to return to take our order. She was apologetic for the wait, for which i understood, since it appeared they were short staffed. She placed our orders, at which time i took advantage of what i assumed would probably be another extensive wait and used the restroom. I took my daughter with me to avoid having to get up again in the next 10 minutes, when she would surely say she would have to go as well. The restrooms were clean enough and smelled of deodorant, really saw nothing to complain about there.   Upon returning to our table, i noticed more parties of people were starting to trickle in. Most were large families with young children. What appeared to be the \"busser\", must have been a waiter, since he was now seating people and taking orders for drinks and meals. Both waiters were now pretty occupied with the 12 or so filled tables, with a majority of them being parties of 5 or more people. I was surprised that the wait for our meals was not too terribly long considering the sparse number of employees. My daughter had ordered the chicken tenders from the children's menu. They appeared to be something that was previously frozen and heated in a microwave, along with fries, which were served in a bowl together. She appeared happy with her selection and was amused by the dinosaur shapes. After sampling the tenders, i personally thought the meat was chewy and bland, definitely in need of a dipping sauce. Mine and my husband meals appeared to be adequately portioned and tasted fine, what you would come to expect from a Denny's. My husband did order the potatoes bites as an appetizer, which we received about 2 minutes before the actual meal. They were drastically overcooked in the fryer and the outer coating was hard beyond being edible. The unappetizing appearance immediately made me pass. My husband was not at all impressed with this menu item, mostly because they were burnt. They were served with a bowl of sour cream and ranch, which my husband had to practically drowned them in to eat as many as he did.   After we completed our meals, we again experienced a wait as we had not received our check. I again started to observed the going-ons around me. The manager had only made brief appearances to seat people here and there and took a few drink orders, otherwise was of no assistance to the two staff members. I rarely saw much of our waitress after our food was delivered and our drinks were not offered to be refilled and were empty for the latter part of our meals. Most of the people who had trickled in after us were still waiting on their meals that they had ordered over 20 plus minutes ago. Upon her final appearance of my dining experience, the manager made rounds to various tables and told them the cook was working on each of their meals and it shouldn't be too much longer. When she approached our table of now, for the most part, empty plates, she asked how everything was for us. I did not make waves and simply asked if we could get our check, or if it would be easier for us to head straight to the register. She stated she would be happy to complete our order. Upon paying our bill, she did mention that my daughter's meal was part of the \"kids eat free\" promotion and there was no charge for her menu item, which would explain the large amount of families with younger children. It has been many years since i have dined here, and i can say will probably be many more before i return, if ever."}
{"text":"New management Sergio. Very good manager and does what he can to make customers happy and returning. If you feel like you are not having the experience you should be having, speak to the assistant manager or call between 10am-5pm to speak to the boss. Also if you are not satisfied with your pancakes they are free!"}
{"text":"Ok, normally I wouldn't go to Denny's, but I was traveling with my parents and they wanted to stop here for lunch. Typical, not so clean tables, dirty carpet, dirty bathrooms. The waitstaff was very nice and kept our drinks full, I ordered a chicken salad sandwich. It came out on toasted bread, even had some sliced grapes in it and had a real nice flavor. I'm sure it was out of a container, but it was pretty good. My parents didn't complain, I even asked how their food was, they both said \"OK\", so there you go."}
{"text":"Ok for after a sangria festival. But not good if you leave your wallet on the table by mistake. Very untrustworthy place."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed with my visit today. In the past, no matter what I have ordered, I have plenty of time as I receive my food rather quickly. Today, my waitress was slow and the kitchen was slow enough for a snail to pass it in a race. It took more than 30 minutes for my food to come giving no time to actually eat before my lunch break was over.  I might try one more time before giving up completely. Last thing? The guy in front of me was paying and also complaining about the slow service/food."}
{"text":"Needs better customer service. Walked out without ordering anything. Just because I'm a woman sitting by myself doesn't means I should be ignored or that a table with 2 MEN sitting at it that was sat in the same section I was AFTER ME should be seen to first. Sat there for 5 minutes without a server even coming to my table but the men sure got taken care of."}
{"text":"Sitting here for bout 20 min n no food the lady behind me coughing like crazy I guess no breakfast to day this sucks"}
{"text":"NOT a happy customer today. Almost bit the dust in the DISGUSTING bathroom. My 3 year old had to go so I held her above the toilet because it was so nasty she didn't want to sit on it. Then almost slipped and fell in the big soapy water spot on the floor. That's on top of the pushy waitress. I have me and 2 kids to figure out food for after I took my daughter to the restroom. Not going to happen as soon as I sit down. And NO it was not busy. No need to keep rushing me. IF I ever come again will make sure not to sit in her section. Food was decent as usual."}
{"text":"Just your standard Denny's but the fact that the staff is generally very polite, they have free wifi and are open 24 hours a day, and are not stingy and don't care if you stick around to study and do work, I have to give this place a pretty solid rating.  The food itself is all standard Denny's menu, I can't complain about the food but I really can't say that they made it any better than Denny's anywhere else.   Come here to hang with friends, come here to get some work done, the staff is great and won't bother you and accommodates you when you need to hang out for a bit even after your food is done,"}
{"text":"Food takes a long time to come, I had to start eating snacks because it took so long.   Wifi was free but did not work.   I ordered a bacon avocado cheeseburger but they forgot the avocado. The bun was flimsy. Relatively overpriced for the quality of the food.   Server was nice, thought everything tasted delicious and did not really help with my food selection."}
{"text":"Not sure if the waitress is new or what.  The food was the normal Denny's but the waitress was lost.   About 4 tables behind us got served before ours came out of the kitchen.   Assume that the order never got entered.   But I can say I tried the new one and don't have to comeback"}
{"text":"We really love this Denny's. Our waitresses are always friendly, helpful, and smiling. They go above and beyond to make sure the food is up to the customer's standard and they go the extra mile."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Food was incredible. (Heard they got a new chef...you should definitely give it a try. ) Eggs were fluffy & delicious and the cinnamon bun pancakes- Mmmm! You will love it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to this Denny's regularly and all of the staff is nice and friendly. We have had almost every server, but the tall blonde/younger gal is so sweet! I'm surprised she works here to be honest - management should take good care of her, because she could get a job at any restaurant. We will continue to come here- very fast service and our food is always correct and hot! Love this Denny's!"}
{"text":"Now that Denny's has its \"fit\" menu I swing by there.  Wild caught salmon, veggie egg white omelettes, iced coffee and decent salads make it a good place to dine with those who want to pig out on a grand slam or burger and shake.  I like the 24 hours availability and this location has good service.  Good senior menu too."}
{"text":"Bang for your buck, kind of loud, the waitress was on top of it and fast, food was delicious and I'd return for sure. I just got the $4 biscuits and gravy with hash browns and eggs! What a deal! Tasty, filling, and cheap."}
{"text":"I tried one of their new items on the new cheesy menu- chicken fried steak. It was thinner and smaller then I expected. Also, having cheese on top of my hash browns was a bit odd. Other then that, i have always loved dennys coffee for some reason and this time it did not disappoint. Me and the significant other sat and chatted for a while to a few cups of coffee after our meal. It was very nice :) The restrooms are a little outdated, reminds me of a turnpike truck stop gas station bathroom."}
{"text":"Speedy service and food. I  love Denny's. You can read my reviews on all the other Denny's I've ever been and it's always consistent.  I have loved every single Denny's that I have been to and this was no exception. For some reason, i am just so addicted to their coffee!!!!  As for food, I go for their build your own grand slam. On that note, I only go to Denny's for breakfast so I cant speak for the regular menu."}
{"text":"this place nuse to be run down dirty with bad service but now its nice and clean. but the sad sad thing is the waitress still suck big time. you have to ask for straws for you cold drinks and forgets to re fills and pretty much anything you ask for. when it comes to paying she gives big smile for tips. its not your smile that makes tips, it your good service. owner or management when you gonna get it right. im doing you a favor by coming here. she even served badly burnt toast which should of never came to my table. i gave the benefit of doubt but as usual still this place suck with service. will not ever come back again."}
{"text":"Took mom to dinner     Waitress was sweet  The one with the tattoos and blue nails was not very clean in my opinion.  Was putting in an order when we walked in with her left hand over her mouth!! Nasty. Did not even wash her hands.   Ewwwl.  Thank God she was not our waitress as I would have said something. The Coke was not properly calibrated.  There was not enough syrup."}
{"text":"My family & I used to frequent this restaurant a fair bit when we lived in the NE. It happened to be the best restaurant so close to our home. Truthfully, there have been a couple of waitstaff who were quite rude, but thankfully more of them were nicer than that! This was always one of my favorite places to go with friends as well, to have a milkshake and share a plate of fries. They make a really nice tropical spritzer, and I always loved ordering their 24-hour breakfast :d  The style of the restaurant itself is very classy, and even has a counter like a diner would. There's plenty of booth seating, and as far as I know there's still a smoking room.  Just be careful about being sucked into the claw machine. That's not as dramatic as it sounds, since it's a glass box of plush toys where you put in a loonie and use a joy stick to collect a prize, but bewarned: it's tricky. I once spent $5 and over 10 minutes to get a toy owl :)"}
{"text":"this place is sooooooo hot ac is down i highly recommend not coming here its way too hot even with the portable ac (fyi fans aren't portable ac units)  the togo service is always extremely slow most likely my last time here at this location.   Customer service is ok and it's not there fault but I think things can be made better at this location. Like one being having ranch prepped and ready for the rush on the weekend. Maybe I'll try this location in a few week but for now they've lost me"}
{"text":"Great server she seem very tired  But once i brung it to her attention  She did the best she could to make me n my guest feel welcome.  Very clean compared to ones here in Arizona"}
{"text":"Didn't have to wait to long to be seated,although it was fairly empty but waiter told me no clean tables. Got sat at a dirty table then had to ask my server to clean it. She had no problem doing that, but as a former server that should never be asked.  Our table had no silverware so we looked at our food for a minute before we could eat it.   When my partner received his water with lemon, the lemon had the parts of the sticker on it . It seem as if no one try's at this location. I'm sorry to say this will be my last run with this location! NEVER EVER AGAIN    First I never got my side of onions mushrooms and jalape√±o. Supposed to be all you can eat pancakes they supposed only put 3 cakes on a plate. My partner only got two.  She told him she will get his extra pancake next time. He quickly asked for a second order, so the second ordered arrived only two cakes on the plate!!!! I asked for the manager this server tells me they don't have a manager no ones in charge. I'm not understanding how this business is operating, then the waitress says she's pay for the cakes. I have money don't need you guys to pay just get it right.  I think Paola the server was sincere but she differently don't deserve to work for this company! This store need to be shut down no manager working here who takes care of business this place is in the middle of the GHETTO AND the staff is all female. I'll definitely be calling corporate."}
{"text":"Thanks tiffany for a quick and speedy service.  2 o'clock am on a Tuesday isn't busy at all that's why you guys should keep tiffany busy by joining her. She's very easy to talk to.  The cook All I can say is fast clean and Dynomite"}
{"text":"Pecan pancakes..I love you:) I like this place for breakfast. Yummy pancakes, great scrambled eggs. It's just the best choice for a hearty breakfast in Mississauga."}
{"text":"We didn't want to go to the Casa De Waffles after a late arriving flight, so we headed here instead. At midnight on a weeknight, there were still a few customers but it was quiet.  Super Bird for my daughter, Turkey Club for me. Both were delivered by a smiling waitress a reasonable time later. Good portion of nicely cooked fries on the side.  I know that Denny's has a less than stellar reputation, but late at night in South End if you don't want to deal with the crazies up at Midnight Diner, you'll do well to come down to Tyvola for Denny's."}
{"text":"Just visited this new Denny's this morning. It's a much newer, hip, and updated version of what Denny's typically is or was. Food came out quick and just as ordered. A definite go to!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here Saturday morning and short and simple, 1 star for the service, no stars for the food and the dirty flatware.  I ordered 2 eggs over medium with sausage and hash browns with sourdough toast.  The eggs were sub-small size(could have been quail eggs), the sausage were the size of a AAA battery, the hash-browns were very thin, burned, and cold.  But the topper was the toast, 2 slices cut in half, with 1 piece saturated with butter and the other 3 totally dry.  Feel like the cook threw the food on the plate from across the room, maybe to impress a waitress he likes.  My buddy drove and his wife said he always comes here for breakfast because he likes the club sandwich for breakfast...which to me looked pathetic as club sandwiches go(did not realize he is such a culinary spode).  His wife and daughter later told me he always goes there for the sandwich and won't listen to them that they want to go somewhere else.    I told his wife....\"next time YOU drive\"!  Go to Black Bear, IHOP, or one of the great mom & pop joints in town."}
{"text":"I recently visited this location. It was 4am and there are a total of 4 customers here so i expected one of  the 2 waitress on shift to be quick to greet me and seat me, but no, I literally stood at the front for 5 minutes before anyone said a word to me. Finally I was seated and the waitress sat me.  She takes my drink order (a lemonade) and says she'll be right back for my order. So after 15 minutes she comes back for my order (still no drink) takes my order and then doesn't remember my drink order.. Okay it's early so I give her a break and tell her again, lemonade please. 5 minutes later I receive my STRAWBERRY lemonade.. (Okay it was probably better anyways, but not the point haha). The food came maybe 10 minutes after ordering so that wasn't too bad. All I ordered was a chicken strip basket and frys. It was just really disappointing that when I originally placed my order I had requested Buffalo sause and ketchup to be brought to the table sense there was not a bottle currently on the table, well it didn't come with the food. I have many friends that work in the restaurant industry so again this wasn't a huge issue at first so I kindly reminded her of my request. After about 10 minutes of my food sitting in front of me just getting cold I just went over to another table to get a bottle of ketchup. The entire time I had food, my waitress never once came to check on me, refill my drink or bring me any sause. I finished my food and sat there for an additional 10 minutes and still nothing. I finally just left money for my tab and TIP on the table and went to leave. This is when the waitress started yelling across the bar for me to stop, she sprinted across the dinning room because she thought I wasnt going to pay for my meal. FINALLY I get some attention lol. I told her I I had just gotten off of work so I stopped in, had nobody actually help me and still paid my bill! All she had to say was oh, okay... yeah so even though I work right across the street I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this place was ridiculous . Don't waste your time. I like Denny's and their food but the service here was a joke. We sat for an hour without a word from our waitress or our food in site so we decided to walk out . The waitresses were just gossiping . The place wasn't even busy. It's not even worth the star I gave it."}
{"text":"The Dennys near the Venetian is the best. Gets crowded so be prepared to wait. Fast and cheap breakfast, you can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"Today was our second attempt at breakfast at the new Denny's at Franklin Square. First time we tried we were seated and waited 15 plus minutes for a server to take our drink orders. It wasn't even busy. She never brought the drinks and we walked out.    We decided to give them another chance today, they weren't even busy and the same thing happened. Horrible management and staff. We will never step foot through the door there again."}
{"text":"Why am I so consistantly happy at this Dennys? You would love the way Jeremy and Wendy treated me and Flo! Also I love their thin crunchy bacon, eggs, and great coffee. Thanks to the wonderful staff who smile and are so enthusiastic. Talkin 'bout Jeremy!"}
{"text":"It's so nice to have Denny's here! Same great coffee and food. Service impeccable thanks to Maya."}
{"text":"The Denny's is tucked away in a strip mall, behind Starbucks and in front of a 24-hour Fitness.  It is about 10 minutes away from the Strip, but I don't think this is considered touristy one bit.  The people who came in all looked local (like they have a tourist sign on their head?)... older folks, families, and the table next to me were 2 little old Korean ladies just catching up over a shared bacon and eggs platter.  We came on a Monday (President's Day) around 8:00 and was seated immediately.  Service is slow but at least the place is clean, and they filled our coffee frequently.   They support the local hockey team, with a Hat Trick promotion for the Vegas Golden Knights.  I thought that was cool that this particular location embraced the new team.  Denny's does breakfast right. I find it rare that a Denny's screws up breakfast, and this one did not disappoint.  I am not a fan of their beverages, so right after brekkie, I walked over to starbucks and got myself a delicious soy latte."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at any restaurant. People walking out because they couldn't get service. Our breakfasts were cold, tasted like it had been made yesterday, couldn't get refills on any drinks and then had to put up with rude employees. You can't give zero stars and leave a review. We will never go back to this Denny's or probably any Denny's again. My daughter has actually had stomach pains since we left. With everything that's wrong with this place I hope it not food poisoning."}
{"text":"This Denny's has fed me on a few inebriated occasions. Not sure if the food really takes as long as it feels or I'm just an impatient drunkard, but the servers have always put up with us; so for that, I am grateful.   Unfortuanately, the food still tastes like crap no matter how drunk I am."}
{"text":"My waitress,  Nicole,  was great and made my experience wonderful!  She has an addictive smile and makes eye contact with everyone when she's walking thru the dining room.  I had the $4 bisquits and gravy that came with 2 eggs and has browns.  Delicious and predictably yummy."}
{"text":"I love Denny's and this location is very nice and close to home. Everyone there is really nice, whether I am there by myself or I am with a big group of fans they always treat me right. The food is good and affordable. Maybe if you are lucky then Lenny will sing a song for you!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at a lot of Denny's across the nation and noted what we like most.  The service makes all the difference and our waiter, Carlos Figueroa, was the happiest and most positive, as well as professional and skilled, individual we've met in awhile.   Besides the breakfast being the great Denny's standard,  we especially enjoyed visiting with Carlos.  He would excel at a high-end restaurant.  Stop by and be sure to order the pumpkin pancakes.   Say hello to Carlos for us."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes to be seated, and left without ever talking to anyone. Just stood at the front desk. People walked up to pay their receipt and were helped but still no one talked to me. I went to a local owned bagel shop nearby and the Frys supermarket and grabbed breakfast faster and cheaper. Awful service, will not eat at this location again"}
{"text":"Heading to CIAA and stopped in for some breakfast before my day begin. I was seated quickly and the waitress came over for my order. The Fit Slam was superb along with my fresh slices of fruit. My accommodation of decaf coffee and water created the best breakfast in Concord. Hopefully, the rest of my day will be great since my start was excellent at Denny's!"}
{"text":"Slow slow service. Employees standing around and talking instead of taking orders and refilling coffee. Waited about 10 minutes after seating to take my order, 10 minutes after finished eating for our check."}
{"text":"Great service  great food I like to go to this location for louch the skilleta are awesome"}
{"text":"Visited here on Friday September 23, 2016 at 9AM.  This Denny's is located on the corner of Tropicana & Eastern in the same parking lot as Savers.    I've noticed that this place has stopped giving a damn about the appearance of the place.  The whole place is pretty dirty in general.  You can see where they had luau decorations taped around the restaurant and whoever started taking them down (months ago) didn't even bother to take all of the decorations down or the pieces of tape.    $34.48 got us two breakfasts, two coffees, and some pancake pups for the kiddo. The quality of the food is good usually but it takes a while which I don't mind.    I got the \"all-american slam\" which comes with sausage, bacon, cheesy eggs, hashbrowns, and your choice of bread.  I asked our waiter if I could have french fries instead of hashbrowns and he said that was okay but then he never brought them.  He never came to check on us either so I just let it go.  It wasn't meant to be!  Also my coffee cup had lipstick on it which kinda grossed me out but also not a big deal.   Story time...okay...so about two years ago I went to McDonald's on Pecos & Desert Inn and there was this insane old man there.  He was wearing a bright pink outfit and had on clown shoes and a pair of those glasses with a plastic nose attached.  He ordered an ice cream cone and started to lick it seductively and was singing and dancing.  You may be thinking ....hey Rach...what does this have to do with the review?  Well HE WAS THERE at this Denny's that day.  That same nutcase! He still had on the fake nose and he had a stuffed toy dog with him that was sitting on the table and he had placed a glass of water in front of the dog and put a straw in its mouth.  What a weirdo!!  It cracked me up to see him again."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst dennys i have ever been to. I went at 11 pm on a week night and the service was just horrible. The establishment was very dirty. The cook in the back was complaining he had to make food. As the overnight manager sat down and joked loudly with employees. I will NEVER recommend nor return here. 1 good thing is this dennys would be very easy to dine and dash from because abosolutley no employees pay attention to you."}
{"text":"It's a Denny's. Nothing stellar about it.   However, I will say the staff is very efficient, almost robotic. Service was on point.   They even put up balloons, ribbons, and streamers in American colors - because it was Olympics week. It was festive, like a party."}
{"text":"Ehhh pancakes, eggs, hashbrowns and fruit and a hot chocolate....'nuff said."}
{"text":"Horribly slow and rude servers....  Food was cold and not adequately prepared. Worst Denny's in Calgary for sure"}
{"text":"My family and I went to this Denny's for lunch. It was pretty busy and our server was very welcoming. However, we were served our meals and there were no utensils found. Very friendly service, and it seemed our server had alot of tables and he was doing the best he could. Other patrons were yelling check please after having to wait so long. We waited a while for our check too, but it wasn't  a huge deal. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our fare! I had the American slam, my son had chicken fingers and the nachos my husband had were so delectable. This enormous portion could feed 2 or even 3! Overall, we enjoyed our experience here and will return."}
{"text":"I have to say, Dennys has really stepped up their game. The am crew at this Dennys is great. I usually just order stuff of their specials menu, because some of the items on there regular menu are over priced in my opinion. But the coffee is good and the servers are great. Also kids eat free 4~10pm Sunday- Thursday.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"I wish I could recommend this place seeing as it's one of the very limited all night places in the areas and the staff is super friendly and welcoming... Sadly I get sick literally every time I eat here. I keep coming back and trying something different with hopes that I won't feel like I'm dying the next day but I've had no luck. I've tried everything from breakfasts to lunches to dinners, hot foods, cold foods even just water, I get food poisoning every single time. Don't know if food just isn't handled properly or the kitchen is dirty or something but my poor body can't handle any more Denny's."}
{"text":"Been waiting for 30 minutes never had order taken or water. Table behind us had order taken as they just sat down no one cared to ask."}
{"text":"While in Vegas, I visited Denny's because someone handed me a coupon while I walked on Freeman Street. I didn't get a chance to go to the Freeman street location so I ended up going to the one on the Strip.  This was my first experience at Denny's. The view from the ready Durant was amazing as I overlooked the Strip and the Mirage hotel. The restaurant was nice and cool which was great because outside was 108 degrees.  The restaurant was very busy and it took a while for us to get served once we were seated. When the waitress finally came she was very nice. I ordered two eggs, turkey bacon and pancakes dressed with chocolate and icing. It was good I enjoyed it!! I love to eat so it was a great portion size. I couldn't even finish the pancakes and that's rare for me . I would definitely go to Denny's again."}
{"text":"staff is very friendly and helpful.  always make you feel welcome and valued!"}
{"text":"Arrived and was promptly greeted and sat immediately. Drinks came out very quickly, and we were satisfied with the hostess. However, once our waitress came she seemed as though she was in a rush. She didn't introduce herself or ask how were doing. She didn't bother to ask whether or not I wanted hash browns or bread. She just assumed that I wanted hash browns, which luckily I did. I find customer service to be very important but they were friendly which is why I gave three stars instead of two. The wait for the food felt like a long time. We waited for about 30 or so minutes but there were no check in or updates on how we were doing. The other server seemed occupied with one of the tables behind us and just stood there talking. The food was good. If the food came out cold or bad I would have been upset since the wait was so long. I would want the food to be worth the wait. I know it's just Denny's, but it still matters."}
{"text":"This review is mostly based on the time I went to Denny's two Saturday's ago at 9pm. The chef was stellar. Okay, we all understand that Denny's is not expected to have amazing food, but this chef really did it.  I ordered the Peanut Butter Cup Pancakes, which I am super bummed that they aren't putting it on the menu anymore. And the pancakes were perfection. It was cooked until it was crispy on the outside and not at all soggy. The hash browns were also perfectly crisped. For the first time, I had real over-easy eggs. My boyfriend finally got real over-medium eggs.   Anyway, I made sure to send Denny's customer service a note regarding my trip. I really hope that the chef never leaves or if he/she does, please tell me your pancake making secrets."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast on a Sunday morning around 11:30/12.  Half the tables in the restaurant were empty but five parties were waiting on the benches at the front of the restaurant. Stood at the counter waiting to find out how long the wait was for about 5 minutes. People kept looking at us and walking past. Then someone finally came, asked how many, told us it would be a 15 minute wait. I asked if we could sit at the breakfast bar and they said sure. Walked over, sat down, my boyfriend sat down and the chair at the breakfast bar was broken to the point where someone could have easily fallen out and hurt themselves. At that point I said screw this and we left. At ihop now. Having a much better time."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my mom for a quick breakfast before I had to rush off to work, and there were only one or two other tables occupied. We ordered our drinks and breakfasts right away, and they came out nice and quick. We both got skillets, and after a few bites, we realized the sausage was missing from both. We let the server know, and he immediately went back and brought out two orders of sausage,so I like that they were quick to fix the mistake,but we also couldn't find the cheese.. It was pretty much potatoes and veggies, which isn't a bad thing, but I'm not a huge fan of their potatoes, so next time I will try something else. The server was super friendly and apologizing, so I still give him 3 stars:) next time I'll stick with waffles and french toast:)"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I am going to say this, but the new Gouda Bacon Burger is one of the best burgers I have ever had. I love burgers and I have had them everywhere from Burger Bar to Gordon Ramsay, but for the price and distance to my house this Gouda Bacon burger is the ticket! Service here has never been good, but this time I barely noticed."}
{"text":"Waited hour in a half for food! Not busy in here! Waited an additional 23 minutes to get the avacado that was supposed to be on the burger. The servers are not attentive... the manager walked around with out asking to help ..."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of this Denny's as it is close to our home.  We usually get pretty good service, but not today.    My wife and I invited our daughter and her new 6 week old son to eat a late breakfast with us.  We were seated right away, but a waiter never came by to offer us our drinks or take our order.  We also noticed 2 other large families come in and order right away.  After about 15 minutes, we still had not ordered and we decided to leave.  Not one waiter acknowledged us as we watched them repeatedly walk past our table.  I have never experienced any service like this before.    I can only assume that they were afraid of the 6 week old sleeping baby.  A very bad experience.  Don't plan to eat at this place in the future."}
{"text":"Best service ever! Hands down the most attentive service we have ever received in any restaurant. Our server anticipated our every need and made our dining experience one to remember.   The food tasted even better than usual because we were so happy to be there.   Thank you so much Kelly! You literally are the best waitress on the planet!"}
{"text":"First of all, I love the food, Second, the customer service is impeccable at this location. I have been coming to this Denny's for years and I always have a great experience.  I would like to give thanks to my loyal server 'Jennifer' and the chef who always makes my 'secret burrito' (not on the menu).   I am always happily stuffed and satisfied after my meal  Thank you again Denny's for your 5 STAR service!!"}
{"text":"This is a busy location! Right on Las Vegas Blvd just a block North of the Stratosphere Hotel. Dined on a Monday afternoon with my sister since she hadn't been in a long time. And, yes I sat in my favorite booth by the window in the front.  I ordered the BLT with fruit( it comes with fries but can be substituted ) and my sister had the Super Slam with eggs, hash, bacon, sausage and two huge pancakes. We ate it all! Super delicious! Great customer service, extensive menu options and very clean.  Always a great option for comfort food and for those of us that dine on the lighter side.  Total for two meals no drinks(just lemon water) $12.98 plus an added $4 tip. Remember to tip! That's a tough job!"}
{"text":"What a difference of 48 hours make, I ya dinner here on 6/1/2018 on my way to Chicago. My family had a great server who paid attention to detail and made our family, feel welcomed and at ease. So traveling back to St. Louis  6/3/2018 we figured we'll stop in again and experience more of the same. Nope didn't happen. We were seated by the same waitress/server so It started off well then, we sat for a good 25 mins before anyone came over and asked us for drinks or anything. She was a different server than who seated us and served us on Friday Granted they're were only 2 servers that were working and when we came in it was a bit busy. So she finally came and took our order. We ordered some cheddar bites for an Appetizer. and my wife had an omelet and son had a grand slammich, me chicken strips with biscuits and gravy with eggs. So another 30 min wait and then our food came out. Well everyone else's except mine. Shoot people who came in after us food came out before mine. It was suppose to be out 4 mins after my family's food. Another 28 mins later it finally came. I didn't want it but the server (who's fault I don't think it was) apologized and took my meal and son's meal off of the Check.  But I'm not happy At all. I don't know if it was because I am African American or just their not on top of things but today sucked!"}
{"text":"Very clean, very nice, very busy also. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the crew working their magic."}
{"text":"This is the worst Denny's I have ever been to.  I asked for a booth away from other people as I was refunding money (large sum) to a client and they refused.  Then a waitress came to take our order and when I asked for salad instead of fries she said I would get the fries and have to pay for the salad too.  First time ever.  She got all huffy and said loudly that she refused to serve us!  Her manager was there and just as rude!  Don't ever go there!"}
{"text":"Loses orders in process. Doesn't respond to customers well, and aren't accountable for their mistakes."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to use a coupon from a book I bought , bogo deal . You can't beat a weeknight special from time to time . We were greeted by a very friendly man who enthusiastically showed us to our table and then we were welcomed by our server MAT , with one T. I have to say , Mat was amazing !  He was curtious , friendly , smiling and made menu suggestions that helped us in our ordering . I really hope he does well  in life , seems like he deserves good things . As he checked us out at the register , he told us to be safe outside and we told him the same . We found out he doesn't have a car and walks to work , if I were a millionaire, I would have bought the kid a car.....that's how good he was !"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and certainly a breath of fresh air compared to the prices at our hotel, right across the street. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I just walked in because I wanted to treat myself after a long day and was left standing there without any acknowledgement or anything. There were only two tables with people and one person at the individual seating. A worker even noticed me standing there but did not say anything.  After standing there for some time I just left. If you want curteous and friendly service do not come to this Denny's."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I have ever had was told there would be a twenty min wait witch was fine ended up being 40 mins and two groups just walked in and were seated immediately when we were finally seated it was extremely cold and waited another 30 mins for drinks then another 20mins for a refill during our 40 min wait for food  when food finally came they completely for got one persons order excuse for entire situation was only one person in kitchen when we clearly saw four cooks through window  and only discounted ticket $10 will not be back to this location ever so in truth no stars"}
{"text":"I can't speak as to how it is later in the day, but I've been in there almost every morning for the last three weeks around 7am-8am, and the service is always fantastic and the food is too.  The staff is very friendly and very efficient and getting people in and out.  Definitely one of the best places to eat breakfast in Gastonia."}
{"text":"It's affordable breakfast in Las Vegas so I can't entirely complain.  We were up fairly early on a Wednesday morning and decided to walk across the street to this Denny's location.  Lucky for us, we beat the rush...and by rush, I mean there was a line of people out the door and down the sidewalk waiting to be sat. My suggestion, go earlier in the morning to avoid a wait i.e. 8-9:00am. I was surprised to hear our waiter up-selling avocado for our breakfast as this was an easy added cost for me. Avocado was already on my mind so there was no hesitation to say yes when asked.  I know, why would anyone be impressed with that and I tell you, its the simple things in life.  As far as our overall experience, we both ordered the Sante Fe Skillet which surprisingly lacked flavor and didn't seem to have any original seasoning when being prepared.  But I tell you what, I still stuffed my face and walked out with a full and unappealing full belly. It was worth the price."}
{"text":"So, we've actually been here a few times, and the first few times were fine, till our most recent visit.  My order was fine, but everything my boyfriend ordered was messed up.  I don't mean that they gave him the wrong order - they gave him food that was either spoiled or contaminated.    The first fail was the frozen coffee. It's supposed to be your typical ice blended coffee.  He got his drink and thought, \"Oh, I'm excited, coffee\" so he took a long sip and as he swallowed it down, there was a sour after taste.  Puzzled, I asked, \"What's wrong?\" and he said, \"Try this.  This doesn't taste like it's still good.\"  I took a sip and it had a really sour aftertaste. I looked at him and I said, \"What was with that aftertaste?\" and he said, \"I don't know\" and ended up returning it.  He then ordered a veggie burger, which in the past has been his favorite food to order from there.  Well, during this visit, he could only eat half of it because the frozen coffee made him sick.  So we paid for the check, and went home. As soon as he started feeling better, he ate the rest of the burger.  Halfway through, he found a long hair in his burger and he started feeling sick all over again.    Needless to say, we are not coming back."}
{"text":"We Love The Food Here & The Costumer Service Is Amazing Patty ( Our Server ) Was Very Very Nice /Polite & Patient With Us. I Came In With My Family & My Bother In Law Always Get The Chicken Strips Usually It Comes With 5 Strips But That Never Fills Him Up So He Asked Her & She Gave Him 8 Strips & My Boyfriend & I Sometimes Go To Another Restaurant & He Always Gets  A Guadalajara Skillet Because He Doesn't Like Breakfast Food He Comes More For Me AnyWays Patty Was Very Helpful To My Boyfriend He Told Her What The Skillet Had & She Created It. She Is An Amazing Server Most Servers Would Have Been Irritated With Us But Patty Was Very Patient Very Nice Honestly One Of The Best Server I've Seen In A Long Long Time Denys Is Lucky To Have Such A HardWorking Working Women . Thank You So Much Patty For Everything"}
{"text":"What an improvement since it opened. My first visit was atrocious - it took 45 minutes to order, the order and bill was wrong, etc.  None of those problems remain, thankfully.  Service is courteous and quick, with frequent but not annoying checkups to make sure there's enough coffee and what not. I don't think I've ever seen more than a couple other tables full, but then I don't go on the weekends.  My biggest complaint is the food, actually - though portions are generous, the quality is somewhat wanting, and a tad pricey compared to others in the area. Also, it seems to me there used to be more options for breakfast on the menu - and despite a plethora of selections, there seem to be few distinct options, if that makes any sense at all.  One thing's for sure: a 24h restaurant is a rarity in Oakville, and more than welcome in my book. Just don't expect me to come here when the better options are open."}
{"text":"I have since returned to this Denny's and my experiences have improved.  There is a new assistant manager by the name of Gerri and she is a MAJOR asset.  I assist an elderly man who is on a low sodium diet and she has assisted us with adjusting the menu to lower the sodium on the 55 plus menu and did it with a smile and actual concern for his needs (she isn't humoring us - she actually cares).  Because of her being there I foresee improvements coming down the line.  From what I can tell she needs to be promoted to General Manager - if the General Manager that was there during the cross contamination incident is still employed at this location, then Gerri should replace her.  I will say that continued improvement is needed at the hostess desk (previously mentioned in quite a few Yelp reviews located here).  Quickness is not their strong point and I do think the wall causes visual issues however, a strong TEAM would be able to work around this problem.   This Denny's needs to teach ALL of it's employees about cross contamination !!  I watched as an employee dropped some jelly packets on the floor in the food service line and picked them up and placed them back in the hopper to be placed onto a table.  I advised her that what she was doing was completely against code and she was creating a cross contamination situation.  She didn't acknowledge me and just walked to the back of the restaurant to get a manager.  I explained to the manager what happened and she assured me that she would take care of it.  Of course, within two minutes the young lady comes over with the hopper with the same amount of jelly in it - NONE of the jellies had been dumped.  I said - you are dumping the jelly ? and her reply was \"Just Drop It\".  Which I of course didn't drop so the manager had to come over to handle that situation.  I told the manager that I could drop it right in the lap of the health inspector.  The manager went on to tell me that the health inspector wouldn't care about dropped jelly and cross contamination !!  Her attitude just showed that from management down this crew could care less about the quality of their food or the fact that they could make a customer sick .....  STAY AWAY !!"}
{"text":"Honestly, there are not enough words to express how terrible this place is. First let me start by how crazy that place is. It's packed! My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday morning. Granted I know it gets crazy, but it was like Club Denny's in there. Moving past that, our server sat us at a table that had not been cleaned and floor was a mess, the wall had old stains on it (from God knows what) so after taking 20 minutes to order coffee and 45 just to order food, I had to use the restroom. What I walked into was something out of a nightmare. The floor was covered in water, toilet paper everywhere, smears on the wall.... No thank you. I'll hold it. Finally our food comes, cold mind you. I couldn't wait to get the hell out of this place! Never going back to this location ever again. PLEASE LEARN CLEANNESS."}
{"text":"A lot of people eat breakfast there.. Well, food is legit but takes forever to get my combo! I love their french toast btw."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Dennys I've ever visited... it was 5am last Friday morning ,,, my friend and I both ordered the grand slam breakfast with the ham slice ....he had his to go and I had mine there,,, ordered eggs basted .. the waitress wasn't sure what that meant .. so I explained.. I said I'll take them over easy if it was a problem ... no she said it was fine ... what I got was two egg balls ???? Hashbrowns were great .. bacon &sausage were ok... she brought out the pancakes late because (?) They were completely black ... you could smell the burn .... I couldn't believe she served them... there was only one other person in the restaurant ... we checked the to go and they were the same ... so we left them ..  the bill was 25$ plus a 7 $ tip ..( after all she was working...) she wasn't the cook... I asked if he was new or something .. she said no... when we got home we had to throw out the to go breakfast as it was swimming in grease.. truly disgusting ...."}
{"text":"This will be my last time at this location. Your restaurant is filthy. The chairs are almost black with dirt, the booths are ripped and torn. The same dirt and stains and dust on the windowsill from where I sat in the same booth a week ago. You lost our group business (about 10 of us) about 2 months ago because you late night (9-10pm) manager (Monday nights) and service sucked ass. Turn on or up the AC. Your guests and employees should be sweating inside. Spend some money and fix and clean your restaurant. Take pride in your business. Some of the staff there are great. But enough is enough."}
{"text":"Had to update my review for this Denny's, I went in to be seated and was acknowledged by nobody... People made eye contact and nobody said a word other than a busier who took our name down, well long story short 10 min later we just left. I looked around at people's faces and they didn't look too happy so that just gave us more reason to leave, it's unfortunate how shitty the service is here cause it's so close to my house but I will no longer be going to this one after several encounters of bad service."}
{"text":"We were there on 4/25/15. My husband tried to use his AARP card on our $20 check. A whole $2 discount. The manager implied that his card was a fake. He's had this card for 13 years. Who knew there was such a thing as a faked AARP card. Customer service at this location was very poor."}
{"text":"I never got my coffee  after asking for it 3 times. The food was good as usual the bus boy spilled juice and food on my daughter ."}
{"text":"We've frequented Denny's @ Crowfoot for some time now and every time, it delivers!  Breakfast tastes so good.  We always get the Veggie Omelette that's loaded with fresh veggies like tomatoes, zucchini, spinach, mushrooms and cheese.  Comes with toast and hash browns.  I always substitute the hash browns with tomato slices.  Peanut butter always comes without asking and that is what I call great wait service!    Also, recently Denny's @ Crowfoot was renovated and it looks classy in there with dark colors on the wall, the booths, and the nice new brown tiled walls.  Good to see the old staff there again after being closed for a month!  Now, it's open again!"}
{"text":"I ordered something as simple as the sampler which included cheese quesadillas, mozzarella sticks, and chicken tenders. Like food that could be mastered in a college kids dorm room... soooooo how does one mess this up so bad!? A CHEESE QUESADILLA THOUGH! There had to have been some fine print I missed that said the quesadillas were light cheese quesadillas and the chicken tenders must've been a typo and were really supposed to state chicken nuggets... extra dry.. like Vegas heat dry... the mozzarella sticks were cooked ok.. but the rest was awful. I called to tell them of my food... or whatever it is I got... and was told to come back.. my hotel is far from this location and it 430 am! I wanted to eat and sleep.. not get all the way to my room to this plot twist... if you find yourself hungry but don't want to pay an arm and a leg for food... and you just so happen to walk by this Dennys.. skip this and just go to Walgreens and buy a sandwich... you'll thank me."}
{"text":"I love their stakes and i come here every week just to get the t bone steak, it is completely delicious!   Great atmosphere, there is always a lot people and the waiters are nice; food portion is great as well!"}
{"text":"Denny's Tahiti Village ~ Cheapest Breakfast with the most selections ~ quality / consistency / convenience / open 24/7 /  Fluffy Buttermilk Strawberries & Cream Pancakes ~ Yum!  My perpetual smiling Server Elizabeth is the best ~ anticipates what's needed before I can ask for it.    This location has always gotten it right during my visits.    & It's a big + that large tables are plentiful for families & groups, as they seem to be more scarce in many restaurants."}
{"text":"I wish I would have looked at the reviews first. This location is horrible! Our drinks sat empty for 15 minutes, our food came out at different times, the toast came out burnt. The waitress didn't come back to check on us, so after waiting 10 minutes (and receiving my meal late), I had to go ask for the salsa that was missing from my meal. They also didn't have any small cups for children? Where is the manager? This place is a mess. They brought out the replacement toast as I asked for our bill. The toast is STILL burnt! Are you kidding me? I've been waiting for 10 minutes for my to go box, which doesn't seem to ever be coming."}
{"text":"It's Denny's.  What can I say.  Typical chain food.  Service is good.  Kids love it.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Prices are low."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was soo bad. Nobody around when you need them, won't mind a further drive for better service next time"}
{"text":"Food and table service was good but the hostess and gal at the register were both very rude."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. Denny's isn't exactly the greatest place to eat in general- but sometimes it's just convenient! We made the mistake of popping by here a few months ago for some breakfast. The service was terrible, they got the order wrong and they were plain rude. We were seated at the back of the restaurant by a door and it was freezing cold so we asked to be moved to a different table (it was not even busy) and they said no at first and finally when they agreed they basically threw our menus on the table and walked away abruptly. It took forever to get our food and it was cold by the time we did.   When we went up to the till to pay the girl was SO unbelievably rude. She mumbled how we would like to pay and I didn't hear her so when I said \"pardon me?\" she responds with \"I SAID....\" in a rude tone. Then she proceeded to roll her eyes at us about 12 times.   We almost never go to Denny's and we still had their rewards card so we asked what we can do with it and if there is any way to claim our points since they no longer use the card. She responds with \"throw that out\". I once again asked, \"is there any way I can claim the points that I have?\" she once again responds saying \"I SAID throw that out\" with such attitude. At that point I got annoyed and asked to speak with the manager to which her response was \"k then\". Are you serious? It gets better....when the manager came she says \"that girl wants to meet with you who knows why\". WHAT. Instead of explaining things to me the manager rudely tells me that instead of wasting their time I should check my email for instructions. Wasting your time? Gotcha.   Seriously- this place is ridiculous. The food is terrible, the service is terrible and the management is TERRIBLE. Do yourself a favour and don't go here ever."}
{"text":"The waiting time for just drinks was ridiculous,  plus they had to come back and ask again what our drinks were because they forgot . I had ordered the appetizer sampler ( chicken fingers, chips and queso, onion rings). Everything was so greasy I didn't even eat it . They chicken tasted like rubber and the chips were soggy because of the amount of grease . I had complained about the chicken and the woman serving us had said she would take it off our order . She gives me the check with the chicken still on it . I then proceeded to tell her again what the issue was .  She acted like it was her first time hearing the complaint .  She then took the receipt and took off for about 10 minutes . Comes back and hands me the same receipt !!! I go up to the cashier and my luck she's the cashier ad well LOL. She still had no clue what I was talking about and didn't do a thing about how gross the food was . No discount,  no taking something off of the price ,  NOTHING. Needless to say no tip was given and I won't be bringing my presence here again ."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Had to ask them to bring out food they forgot about 5 times. They didn't even have silverware we had to ask 3 times. Our server was very slow taking her sweet time. The food was great but We won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this awful excuse for a diner/restaurant? We were seated quickly, which was nice, and that was the last good part of my experience. We had a table of 5 during a not-so-busy time. It took a good 10 minutes for our server to come get drink orders, then another 10 before we got to order food. Doesn't sound bad so far? Just wait.   20 minutes later she comes back and informs us they are out of something we ordered. Ok, no problem, we order a substitute, and then she goes and FINALLY rings our order in. We watched her put the order in 20 minutes after we ordered. During the next 45 minutes she \"serves\" us once and that was bringing one bowl of soup out, not asking about refills. During this time I got up and had to get the coffee pot to refill our drinks. I HAD TO DO IT MYSELF JUST TO GET SERVICE!  Food comes out eventually and mine is wrong, and two others I am with also have wrong food. But we didn't want to wait another 45 minutes so we ate it begrudgingly. She apologizes very insincerely about the wait and the wrong food.  As we are paying I hear multiple people say they have been waiting over an hour and haven't gotten food. WE WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES!   Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location, or even Denny's establishments every again!! I urge everyone reading this to stay away!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Denny's several times and always had a great breakfast. Denny's has really stepped up and provide great options for the health conscious patron. You can order a meal in several different ways so scan the menu closely as you can get the same meal cheaper if you know how. The service has always been great and will keep going back often."}
{"text":"On our way to Red Rock for some hiking and needed some breakfast. I normally like Denny's but this place was pretty bad. The service was terrible and the food was marginal at best. I had a similar experience to others where the waitress dropped the food off and never came back."}
{"text":"This place is clean and has an amazing view if you are seated in the prime location, other than that horrible! First when we got in, someone tells us to wait in line to be seated, but then a different hostess is starting to seat random ppl asking if they were next. Service is beyond slow!! Next time, i think not!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in years but my normal location on cooper I guess recently closed, so I went a little further to this one.  Went around 6:30 am, and at the time there was only 5 guest total including me. Waitress was quick with everything I ordered even when more people started to trickle in which by herself she took care of 10 tables smoothly.   I ordered 4 pieces of bacon, 2 eggs over medium, hash browns, wheat toast, and coffee. I always thought dennys had great coffee and it definitely hit the spot today. I do wish the food was a little hotter and the bacon cooked a little longer but overall it was edible and I cleaned my plate. I will just know for next time to ask for crispier bacon. :-)   The waitress name was Nicole but some guest who must be regulars were calling her Nikki. She did a great job."}
{"text":"Okay so while this a Denny's this Denny's has really good service they always have! So while your grand slam won't taste better it will be brought to you with a bigger smile."}
{"text":"Dennys staff could not have been nicer! We went there for thanksgiving dinner and everyone was soooo nice! Felt right at home! The turkey dinner was awesome! Thanks for being open and for the staff who worked hard for the public to make it a special day for us..."}
{"text":"Denny's on the strip is good eats.  I know what youre thinking, it's a Dennys.  Sure, but when you compare this one to other Dennys, or even to other diners in geneneral, its a cut above.  we been coming here for awhile now and weve always noticed how cleen, professional and tasty this one is.  The fried fare is a cut above too, always tasting good, not flat (not dirty) probably because they clean their grils and replace the oils.  Definitely chek this Dennys out."}
{"text":"This rating is for their breakfast as we have only had lunch and dinner there once each.  We also feel that we are treated very well when we visit them. The wait staff is always friendly and they seem to work together to get food out. We have been going to this Denny's for over 4 years and have had one mediocre meal. 99% of our visits are for breakfast and we have never been disappointed. The food is always fresh and refills are speedy. We know most of the servers, and Nadia (the hostess) is a wonderful, funny woman.She knows us well enough to give us a hard time if we miss a weekend for breakfast. I usually get he Grand Slam w eggs, turkey bacon, wheat pancakes and extra crispy hash browns. My GF usually does the Moons Over My Hammy Omelet w spinach added.  Always tasty food!"}
{"text":"I had such a good experience here with my friend this morning. Our check came out to less than $8.00 & we left an $8.00 tip. We ordered only one breakfast meal because I was limited on what I could eat because of my wisdom teeth being extracted a few days prior. So I just ate her eggs, scrambled soft. They were delicious! No extra seasoning needed & the perfect balance of raw & cooked. She said her pancakes & sausage were also very good. It was extremely crowded, but our waitress, Ty, was on point. My friend & I were so impressed with her that we personally handed her the tip. I only gave four stars because our table was so easy to service. The rest of the staff was also very polite & friendly, but it was Ty who blew us away. I will not hesitate to return & I highly recommend this Denny's."}
{"text":"One of the rudest manager I met that works here. He would give attitude to everyone even to his own employees. I never got his name, but he was a very old man. He was rude from the start of asking how many we were. We were trying to pay and then he just continued to give the worse attitude to everyone he spoke to. He deserves to be gone with his represents the place."}
{"text":"Serice painfuly slow.... A simple order is taking forever waiting 30 mins pluss for the food andcthe place isnt even packed, what gives!!!!!!  Getting angry"}
{"text":"Never ever would go to this place again. Poor management and training!!! Put it out of your mind. Save yourselves before it's too late! 1. Got there at 8:45 PM and were the only customers there, other than two tables already eating. Table for two. 2. Took 15 minutes to get drinks and place order. Waiter is 3rd day on the job. 3. While waiting for drinks, and after ordering our food, a table of 4 arrives. Waitress knows them, proceeds to chat with them for about 10 minutes. During that conversation she disclosed she is just back to work after having the flu. We start getting concerned. She then disclosed that in her day job she is working with a patient with shingles. We are growing more concerned and disgusted at such conversation by a waitress in a restaurant.  4. 30 minutes out coffee arrives. No set-ups offered had to get them ourselves from another table. 5. It's now 45 minutes in, and table for 4 already served and we are still waiting. Our waiter comes back and reminds us again it's his 3rd day on the job. We notice he is sweating profusely from his face. Our concerns and disgust getting even worse. 6. We begin to discuss privately whether we should just leave, that the horrible service and disgusting conversations of staff are making us worried about getting sick. It's an omen... 7. It's now 10:05. We have been there 1 hour and 20 minutes. We got up and left and had a wonderful hot meal at the 24 hour McDonalds on Bell Road (thanks Ronald!) served by friendly non-gross staff. You couldn't pay me to visit this or any Denny's again. IHOP HERE WE COME."}
{"text":"Honestly Denny's come on now, I end up giving you all several chances to improve your service and outcome but every-time I always walk out asking myself why do I go to this place. I am saying this because every-time we go there it seems like forever to get seated when there is hardly anyone in there and then we finally get to sit down and they all the waiters and waitresses become \"too busy\" to come by, its bad when you have to get up an ask someone to get an order going and its usually \"oh let me find your server\" no you need to just come and take the order, and get your customers taken care of. I do like going to Denny's its just this location always seems to be \"busy\" doing other things. I went one time and the person behind the counter didn't notice me because of the phone conversation they were having not talking, but either texting or messaging or whatever. I was like when your done Id like to pay so I can leave, I swear its like you have inconvenienced them to no avail. Why your asking well don't go here anymore well its usually because I go because others in my party like this location and its close to where I live. Sorry Denny's need to step it up and make them worth it again."}
{"text":"The place was clean and the food was good. It was prepared quickly and the server was nice. Overall better than Ihop. This is our new breakfast place. The fact"}
{"text":"Great Denny's. Super clean, fast and friendly service. Food was delicious and came out reasonably fast. Will be back."}
{"text":"My son and I come to a Denny's every Thursday, but never the same one. This was our first visit to this particular restaurant. While this restaurant is nice and clean the food here was absolutely disappointing to say the least. We order the same thing every time and some how the portions here were half the size and $6 more. I get the skillet breakfast every time and for some reason this restaurant serves half the usual portion size. We didn't even finish the bacon it tasted so bad. How do you ruin bacon? The cooks are ruining this restaurant. Save your money and head to Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. We had to flag a waiter just to order coffee. When we finally orders & food arrived half of it was cold. Then we could y get a server or runner back to correct the problem. We asked for basic things like butter & they forgot to bring it."}
{"text":"I have had enough flatbread, fruit and veggies and was just itching for a hamburger, a good one.  OMG, Denny's now delivers.  I had an Avocado, Bacon Burger with fries and it was hot and amazing.  Arrived in 35 minutes and it was a very easy process.  I also had a  big slice of cheesecake with real strawberries and whip cream.  I am oh so happy and will be back to the healthy eating tomorrow.  The burger was about 600 calls and 500 for the cheesecake (big slice).  I know just where to go when I want yummy, hot food fast.  YEAH for delivery!!"}
{"text":"We walked in it smelled so bad like sewer and we walked right out and went to another Dennys. Im not able to say on there food as we couldn't stay as the smell was so bad. I would be open to trying again as maybe they were having a sewer issue,but there is now way we could stand the smell."}
{"text":"Went here early on a Monday morning. We were seated right away. Our waitress was super kind and attentive. I think her name was Nancy May(something along those lines). She gave us coffee and always brought another fresh cup of coffee right before we finished. This waitress worked so efficiently;  she was serving about 10 tables at one point all on her own-never did her attitude change. She was jolly and kind the whole time and didn't get stressed with the amount of people she was taking care of.   My husband ordered the t bone steak, I ordered french toast with hash and cheese.  The food was great -as any breakfast place is, but I was more impressed with the service.   Would definitely come back here and would order the steak next time."}
{"text":"I've only been here 10 minutes and the service is already bad. I hate it. Took forever just to get our order taken let alone even get water offered to us."}
{"text":"ok...so it's a chain...BUT...it's usually open when you need it to be (you know...when you can't sleep, or are stumbling home a the wee hours of the morning).  Now the reason I only gave it a 3 is because...use real cheese darn it!!!  Other than that...the skillet breakfast special wasn't bad...and the pancake puppies...they were awesome!  I had the blueberry and white chocolate chip, but the other ones (cinnamon and sugar) looked good too."}
{"text":"Both my chicken strips and salmon were raw. They brought me the wrong burger and fries."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Service is always good and friendly. Last Saturday morning at 8:30 the two rooms were filling up. One room had a group of 10 and other customers. Only two waitresses were on duty, so they were way short of help. At 9 a.m. three more employees walked in. Thank goodness. The waitresses did tell us they'd get to everyone. They kept the cups filled. Once the orders were given the meals did come out quickly.   I noticed that Denny's does take-out breakfast. One customer picking up said that the orange juice cup was not a large. (I thought it was plenty big. Juice isn't soda pop.)  The cashier lady said that juice comes in one size. Well, that wasn't explained on the phone, the lady said. (Would it had made a difference since she didn't like the large size? She could purchased a second or buy a carton at the store.) Anyway....  Kudos to the two waitresses working the floor at 8:30. They did their best. Customers also were patient. Just don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Excellent place to dine if you want to eat something good and cheap at the same time. I have tried the location in McDowell and Miller Rd twice. The service is very good, people are friendly. Both of times I've been pleasantly surprised. :-)"}
{"text":"The usual Denny's fare, but the dining experience was ruined by blaring fifties music. I don't mind oldies, but not that loud at five in the morning! I prefer to read my morning paper in peace. I asked the server to turn it down a bit and she said that she wasn't able to do so."}
{"text":"The worst customer service. I waited to sit down for the hostess to finish ringing up customers and more just kept coming so I waited. When being sat down we were told they had to sit us in the back because they were to busy to clean the other tables. The place wasn't even half way full. We barely got the order in before the waitress walked away from the table.. she never refilled our drinks. When finally getting the check and getting ready to pay there was a line of people being seated so she finished that then took a walk-in customers order. The customer was not looking at menu so he didn't know what he wanted she went over all the choices with him, more than our waitress did. Finally our turn to pay. Oh wait she leaves and makes out waitress check us out. I asked if I was suppose to pay at the table as I would have not had to wait the extra 15 min I just waited she said no. The hostess at that point wasnt busy and I have still yet to find out why they make people wait for no reason. This is the second time it has happened there."}
{"text":"Horrible! I would finish that with service but there was no service. We got seated in a decent time but that was it. We sat at our table while we watched one table seated before us walk out, then saw a table seated after us get served. No eye contact, no we will be with you shortly, and definitely no drink order. It took me and my wife about 15 minuets before we walked out as well. Will not be surprised if this location shuts down in 3 months."}
{"text":"The wait was reasonable, especially for brunch on a Sunday. I reported the condition of the Women's restroom when I used it while we were waiting for our table.  Our server was good, personable and got everyone's order correct. She was a little slow, but it was fairly busy, and she apologized for it. The food was what you'd want and expect from Denny's. Nothing to report there.  I mentioned the rapidly deteriorating bathroom conditions to the hostess *again* when my kids used the bathroom after we ordered, before our food came. She said, \"They're really busy in the back.\"  I replied, \"So, just bc they're busy in the back customers have to be subjected to a dirty bathroom?\" She came back with, \"Well, I'm not cleaning any damn bathroom.\" I just shook my head and walked away.  When we used the restroom one last time before we left, it was even worse, and no one had even attempted to tidy it up at any time, even though there were 3 Hostesses and 2 Cashiers standing right there, as well as two servers I saw in there using the bathroom during two of our trips to the bathroom."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Don't waste your time or money here. 2 times in a row they have messed up my order, and it takes forever to get your food"}
{"text":"They have all you can eat pancakes for four dollars.  Great if you want to eat three pancakes and then wait twenty more minutes for another two and then you're done because those two taste like crap. Certainly are not like the first three.  Well, ok litchfield dennys, you got me.  I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast at 5 am and there were three other tables with customers that had already been served. I ordered a soda and a quesadilla. The waiter brought out my soda after about 10 minutes and then I waited another 30 before you came out again to apologize for the wait.   I'm not much of a cook but even I can make a quesadilla in my microwave in one minute... At that point I paid for the soda and left. I eat out almost every meal and that was some of the worst service that I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Well stopped on our way to the last home game of the pittsburgh pirates on a sunday morning. I think we made the mistake of presenting or free Grand Slam breakfast coupons on arrival had we not shown it I think our services would have been much much better. It was a 45 minute wait. I can understand that if it was busy. But what got me was the couple next to us had 1 coupon and then ordered a full price breakfast. Well they got there food in less then 15 mins. It was not our lovely waitress Amanda's fault at all in fact we left her a tip larger than our total bill but I just think this is how Denny's works. If u hate to give away free breakfasts then why do it? I was at 3 games this year where we got coupons. I'm not sure if I will use the others."}
{"text":"May or may not be surprising due to the fact that this is a Denny's, but I will outline my latest visit to this location anyways.   Breakfast at Denny's with a fair sized group of 8 on a Saturday morning. The waitress was ditzy and favored the \"elbow in the face\" serving technique. Although our drinks stayed full, my friend somehow had the luxury of receiving 3 full glasses of coke, despite his first glass not even being close to empty and ended up being waste. Our orders arrived inconsistently and staggered, with meals being brought out seemingly one at a time. This left some of us at the table waiting minutes until everyone had their food.   The sounding of the FIRE ALARM marked the highlight of the visit. A friend had ordered the cookie dessert (basically a warm cookie topped with ice cream). Not only did she receive the cookie still well into the process of finishing her breakfast, but the waitress had explained that the fire alarm was no concern. She explained the alarm was triggered by leaving the now black and charcoal-smelling cookie placed on our table in the oven too long causing a large amount of  smoke (....hwhat..??!). It was easily the most awful looking, foul smelling dessert I had ever seen brought out of any commercial kitchen. Why the waitress even thought anyone would consider eating a hockey puck is beyond me. Oh, and the cookie was topped with an abundance of ice cream and chocolate sauce so as to conceal the burnt look and smell I'm guessing. SMOOTH MOVE. Obviously after one terrifying bite it was immediately sent back. Needless to say, they were suddenly out of cookies for the day, but that's understandable since its the number one ordered item at 10 am right? Right? The waitress deleted the cookie off the check but nothing else. No alternative dessert, no discount, not even a free OJ. The manager was non existent.   Cheap food? Yes. Open late? Yes. If that's all you care about then look no further. I, however, will seek better alternatives that better deserve my hard-earned money.   Thank you."}
{"text":"I 'celebrated' my birthday enjoying their free Grand Slam dinner on the way home after an evening of shopping last night, which they generously offer and you just provide your photo ID as proof of your birthday ON your birthday.  I opted for the vegetarian 4 choices of the Grand Slam: stack of 2 pancakes, scrambled eggs, hash browns, and English muffins.  They were tasty and  cooked / prepped well.  I waited awhile before they were served so that gave me the feel they actually cooked the food.  Penny was the young waitress on duty and was very polite, and the manager on duty said to me upon checking out, \"happy birthday\" ;) I usually eat at the location annually whenever necessary (since it's close to where I shop & live)- usually on the way home after shopping for my gifts.  I prefer the evenings since it's less busy.  They remodeled and retained the original signature mid-century diner look.  It was clean (including the restroom) and even passed the health inspection.  They even have TVs on with closed-captioning. I thank them for their generous meal (and even remember their free Super Bowl breakfasts- what a crowd that event attracted), so they must be doing well.  I also have had good experiences at the location for my past couple birthdays and therefore may eat there again for my future birthdays!"}
{"text":"Clean, they serve alcohol and the waiter was cool at 3 am. The food is what you come to love and hate about every other Denny's you've been to.  Saw some drama at the table next to us and it was pretty darn entertaining, an ex-husband was bugging his ex for whatever reason and she wasn't having it, let the sparks fly! Soooo the annoying girlfriend was getting involved and was sticking up for her gf, ex husband wasn't having it (we were right next to them, we had to listen) security got involved, high fives everywhere when he got kicked out. Then somehow after it all died down, he snuck back in, by then we were out of there.  The drinks are great, food you know and if you're there in the wee hours you might get a free show."}
{"text":"Been to this location over the years a few times. We have always had good service. Depending on if they are real busy or not depends on how fast your food comes out. We liked it because they were open later at night. Food is ok, We would stop back here, never had a major problem other than maybe waiting for the server to come back if they busy."}
{"text":"We didn't get to eat!!  Didn't even get seated!!  Waited behind 2 other couples at the hostess station for longer than anyone should have to. One couple left and a few mutes later so did we. No one ever came!!  Not even to tell us \"it will be __ minutes\". People were already waiting for tables. People were waiting to pay their bill. And still nobody came!!!!  Lots of empty tables and still you make people wait.   I thought it was only the Denny's at Craig and Tenaya that had bad service but I'm beginning to think now that bad service is a standard for all Denny's!!  I wouldn't even have given 1 star but I had to give something to write this review. We arrived on a Saturday at around 12:30 so it wasn't like they were dealing with the morning rush. Bad management, leads to bad employees, leads to unhappy customers. Come on Denny's, get it together before you become obsolete!!"}
{"text":"Instant diarrhea. 3 people with diarrhea. 40 minute ride home. One bathroom. You can do the math.  I'm pretty sure this was a matter of a lack of cleaniless and food preparatory guidelines not being followed.  Other than that service was slow and food was what you'd expect from any Denny's.  I am just super shitty and it doesn't feel good. Nobody likes instant diarrhea or any diarrhea for that matter. My butt needs ice ."}
{"text":"The site was not especially clean and the staff were indifferent. the only one who seemed on task and service orientated was the \"General manager,\" who was at least friendly. However, the waiter was supercilious and tended to be curt. I ordered a side dish as my breakfast--oatmeal and as I had ordered nothing else and had no idea how this was to be served it was on the waiter to tell me that NO sugar or Milk would be served with the oatmeal. but no--that might be helpful to the customer. Thus a glob of lukewarm wall-paper glue arrived for my eating enjoyment. I then asked for sugar and milk to be told curtly, \"You do have to ask for those things.\" Really, now how would i know that in fact wall paper glue was a side dish??? Dreadful place and weakly trained staff. The oatmeal all considered was not even cheap/reasonable at $3.99. At Nancy's in the tiny town of Willows, California one gets for $2.99 [small] or $3.99 [large] oatmeal, raisins, brown sugar and milk! That is also found on the side dish menu thus this was an absolute disgrace!!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! I took my son here Saturday because the cracked egg was way to packed. So I thought Denny's wouldn't be so packed. Got here and it was busy but not like the other restaurant. Waited thirty minutes and got to a booth that another party left for because there was still trash under the booth. I just thought I waited this long so I'll ask for them to remove it. Fourty minutes for food!!! Then another table which was cleaned by a busser had old food from another party under it. I had to ask for three separate silver wares because they all had food. I told manager and he didn't seem to care and offered me a five dollar off coupon for my next visit!!!!! I told him it wasn't necessary because ill never return. DONT GO HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"With help from my server Bernadette, I ordered an egg white veggie omelette, with red country potatoes with grilled onions and cheese, and rye toast,  Thank you Bernadette!! The red country potatoes instead of hash, with grilled onions and cheese melted on top, was amaaazing! Got salsa and pico de gallo on the side, the salsa complimented the omelette and potatoes perfectly, veggies in omelette were very hearty, better than expected. Next time maybe I'll add jalape√±os or something to the omelette, was missing a certain kick of flavor.  Nice quiet atmosphere on a Tuesday morning, definitely would recommend if you're nearby."}
{"text":"The Vaughan location is worst location!!! I came in tonight hoping to give it another try.. Nope a mistake. Let me start off by saying I lost my appetite there were so many flies in the restaurant. I've been to this location many times and the service is so horrible. One time we waited 45 minutes for two orders of pancakes.... Came out burnt. the older ladies that works there is so rude. They really need to trained the staff on what customer service is!!! I would not recommend this location to anyone ! Horrible service, horrible food."}
{"text":"I don't know if this place is understaffed or just unorganized but the waitress forgot everything so she'd have to come back every 2 minutes  But the food is good"}
{"text":"Every time I've been to this Denny's the service is horrible. I tried it a few times because the first time I went was later in the night so I thought if give it another shot but every time I've gone nothing has changed."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you can. I came here yesterday at about 11:30 am and when we walked in the woman behind the counter rolled her eyes and sighed at our mere presence. She did not want customers. She told me it would be a few minutes. A couple walked in behind us and after a few minutes left. Another family came in after that and after being treated rudely they left too. As we waited we looked around and noticed how filthy the place was. At that point we decided to leave. They had been closed the day before due to a power outage so all workers should have been refreshed from a nice day off. There were tables open, they were just filthy. We ended up around the corner at a place called Brenda's Kitchen. The people were so friendly and the homemade food was so good I placed a huge order to take home for dinner and next day's lunch. After being treated so badly at Denny's we left the woman at Brenda's a huge tip. If felt so nice to be treated good. I don't need eyes rolled at me. If you don't want my money, fine. I will give it to someone else."}
{"text":"This Denny's is an area godsend given how terrible the options are for breakfast joints in the neighborhood. There is a Coras next-door but its always bland overpriced food, bad service, and super slammed on weekends. This place is open 24 hrs, has free WiFi, and the grandslam scores at least a 3/5 if not a 4/5 every time. Staff are OK, service is hit or miss but pricing is fair and the value for dollar beats Coras or any of the fast food joints in the area any day."}
{"text":"It seemed like every Denny's I have ever been to ever everywhere. Coffee was pretty good, service on multiple fill ups was ok."}
{"text":"Had an excellent breakfast at this Denny's. I had the All American Slam with Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Hash browns and Toast. The scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly, the sausages were a little small but were very good. The waitress we had was very professional and polite even considering the table beside us was bitching and complaining about everything. Very good breakfast for a large chain restaurant"}
{"text":"My family and I got takeout from this Denny's and service was relatively quick. The food was decent, typical diner food, but it was good for what it was. My only problem with the place was the service because we seemed to have arrived in between the night shift and the morning shift and the waiters seemed to be a bit preoccupied. All in all, it was a generally good experience."}
{"text":"4 stars = Yay! I'm a fan.   However, I should put this into context.   Let's restructure the Yelp stars for a moment, shall we? When it's 2 a.m. and you've just danced your arse off for 2 hours in Old Town, what are your options for grabbing some food? Yep, you guessed it: Denny's.   4 stars = Yay! It's 2 a.m. and I'm freakin' hungry and I want food now!!! Oh, hi, Denny's, you're open and your food is edible.   So, uhm, yeah.   I had the smoked turkey sandwich. I ate every morsel. I was so hungry, it's true. It was about the best choice for the time - something with substance that wasn't a burger; something healthy that wasn't a meager salad.   I also had 2 hot cups of tea with honey. It may have been Lipton brand, but it was good. Again, I was hungry.   My brother had their Grand Slam sandwich. Everything inside looked and tasted yummy. The bread tasted like syrup, though. Icky.   My other brother had their super big hamburger. It was so big, I'm not sure how anyone eats it. But, he said it was good.   Nothing like chowin' down on some Denny's grub after the club, yo."}
{"text":"Really used to like coming in to see Mary at the counter area but apparently she is no longer there. I always order the waffle and it normally comes out cold and is served with cold syrup but Mary's cheerful personality kept me coming back anyways. This last time, Sunday, November 16, 2014, we sat at the counter and seemed like an inconvenience to our waitress the entire breakfast. There is nothing worse than feeling like you are not worthy of someone's time. I understand that turning over tables is important but it's also important to ensure your guests are satisfied. Couldn't get our waters refilled quickly, food came out cold, waitress was impersonal and the cashier was awfully rude as well. I'd recommend sunrise cafe or protein house instead."}
{"text":"Omelet was terrible.   service was slightly below average at best.. Over priced.. No napkins. Ignored our table"}
{"text":"The food here is good - that's not the problem or why I only gave this Denny's location 2 Stars.  What needs improvement here is the service!  This location is rarely busy, yet the servers are never around to take your order, keep your beverages filled or give you your check.  They aren't busy helping other customers. They just can't be found, period.  The servers must not need tips because they certainly don't earn them!    My favorite thing about Denny's are their free flavor shots in soda.  Pick your soda, pick your flavor(s) and they'll make it.  No extra cost for flavor shots (like Sonic does).  I've gotten Cherry-Vanilla Dr. Pepper, Chocolate Coke, Cherry Sprite and Watermelon Sprite. All good. All the time.    I love their Moons Over My Hammy, which is egg, cheese and ham on grilled sourdough bread that comes with your choice of side.  Their Grand Slam is always a hit because now we can build our own Grand Slam and modify it any way we want.  Their burgers are amazing and HUGE!  Free BASIC Grand Slam, not including drink, on your actual birthday. Just show cashier your Drivers License.  FREE Wi-Fi!!!   I recommend Denny's, but maybe not this location because the service is poor and unprofessional.  They are quick to seat you and check you out, but once you are seated, you are at their mercy!!  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Denny's all around is pretty good usually come for the breakfast (like everyone else lol) and the nachos cause man those things are delicious. Unfortunately today was a bit of a disappointment. They seemed very under staffed and the rest of the people in the dining room looked really irritated. There was a dining room full of people and come to find out there was only one cook in the kitchen and man I feel bad for the guy.   Anyways food wasn't good at all the chili that they put on the nachos tasted just like tomato sauce, had the jalepeno bottle caps and they were completely burnt. Mozzarella cheese sticks had no cheese which I'm assuming it melted out because that was also over cooked. If you have one cook trying to knock out a dining room full of orders then you'll get results like this. If labor is something this location is concerned with then take away a server and bring in a cook to help as long as the food is coming out hot, tasty and looking good then everyone will be happy.   I gave two stars because the servers were moving with a purpose one of the guys was even sweating that's good stuff. Ill come back not anytime soon though they should really up there game because IHOP is rigt across the street."}
{"text":"Awesome late night stop!! Great, Quick Service & Excellent food! First time I can say I've had 5 star service at a Denny's! We almost didn't stop because of a car debate on whether or not to give it a try. There were several cars in the parking lot which could have been a double edged sword. But, I moved away years ago and am home visiting and wanted Denny's mozzarella sticks. I'm lucky I won the debate with Denny's on Litchfield Rd delivering for us tonight.   STEPHANIE our server was AMAZING!!! She made suggestions that were right on point for my mom. She put my 5 yr old's order of Dinosaur chicken nuggets and Goldfish crackers in right away with our mozzarella sticks appetizer. He loved being able to see each item and place the order himself first.  The cook was with it tonight also!! When our mozzarella sticks came out, my 19 yr old son asked and then said \"Are they melted in the middle? I can't stand it when you get them and they aren't even melted in the middle!\"  As I took a bite and the cheese stretched out with my reach he answered himself with \"I guess they are MELTED in the middle!\"    He had the T-Bone steak and eggs-perfect!! Mom had the new Jalape√±o Bacon slam- with the hash browns replaced with scrambled eggs to go with my Jalape√±o Bacon Steak and Cheese Skillet (forgive if I got the name mixed up). But it rocked with prime rib, potatoes, broccoli and bacon all covered with pepper jack queso. Good thing it will reheat well because I can enjoy it for a couple more meals. And needless to say the 5 yr old was happy but Stephanie bringing him bacon after he said he'd really like some, just put him and all of us over the top.  Thank you ARIZONA FOR RENEWING MY FAITH IN DENNY'S"}
{"text":"This is definitely a nicest cleanest friendliest staff that I've ever had at a Denny's restaurant. The waiter is fantastic and the atmosphere is roomy and I will definitely be coming back to this location. They even comped me a belated birthday.."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience of my life.  They served cold coffee. Then we waited forever for our food and the salmon was dry. Waitress hardly ever checked on us and had to ask for coffee refills twice  when she finally got my coffe I had to ask for cream and the only time she was quick was to give me my $50 bill. A friend of mine had a similar experience at this Denny'S last week"}
{"text":"Food is what you'd expect. The service is acceptible as well. I like the price but since this is a diner you have to wait for a seat longer than a normal Dennys.  The big bonus is the kids eat free days. I posted a pic so check it out!"}
{"text":"Meh, its about what you'd expect. The building could be cleaner but Ive been in worse. I cant say I hate the place or its filthy because I'll go there again but there is no wow factor either. Price is fair service is decent and the food is OK."}
{"text":"I called a couple of weeks ago to place an order for simple pancakes.. I was told by Irvin - (the general manager) they'd be ready on 10 minutes.. needless to say  - we were told there was NO ORDER PLACED upon arrival.. we waited 30 minutes for them to prepare a fresh batch of pancakes..   TODAY.. SAME THING!!! I call an order in with the same General Manager - IRVIN GREEN and he tells me the order will be ready in 10 minutes..  we get there and we are told there was NO ORDER PLACED..   This time, I decide to confront the manager who took my order he says - \"yeah, so what? -- your pancakes would have been cold if we made them when you called.\"  Wow!"}
{"text":"I had ordered online a while ago. I get one of the specialty pancakes. I got home and it was missing all the toppings. I called just to let them know since I do not live too close so I was not going to go all the way back up there. Talked to a really nice guy on the phone and he was very apologetic and said he will replace it for me the next time I was in the area and could stop by. That was a few weeks ago, maybe even a month ago and today I was finally up there. I went in not even expecting for them to know what I was talking about but then a guy came out and said he remembered me because he was the one I talked to on the phone that day! He asked me how I would like my eggs and if I wanted bacon or sausage. I assumed I would only be getting replacement pancakes so I was thrilled. A few mins later he came out with my food. So thank you Elliot! You made my day!"}
{"text":"Couldn't say anything bad about this place. Nice and clean and same as any other Denny's. Nothing more and nothing less. Didn't expect something big or something small. Hey, it's Dennys. They lost a star for me because the waitress barely spoke English. I couldn't understand one thing out of her except, \"welcome to Denny's.\" Otherwise, again, just Dennys."}
{"text":"Great service on the morning of Xmas day restaurant super buzzy with multiples fire hazard violation people blocking the aisles put in extra seats by the side of the booth the bathroom was super dirty and papers all over the place our meals was so so but my chocolate shake was amazing at the end the girl on the cashier could it be a little nicer to explain how to put the tip on the credit card in general everybody working busy as a team and it really busy day"}
{"text":"the place is nice the food was also good although the excess oil with hamburger meat but is acceptable! We were attended and an old laddy called MANDY which gave us lousy service, made a mistake in the order and never accepted with bad attitude, she never paid attention to us, I think people should have better attitudes to work with people, this situation was irritating, thanks to bad service MANDY we do not return to this place!"}
{"text":"Horrible service !! It wasn't even busy and we waited about a hour for our food ! Our food came out cold and soggy like if it was sitting there for 30 minutes. We waited so long to be that disappointed on our food , and our server was just being rude and not even taking care of his tables at all ."}
{"text":"Undermanned on a Sunday morning is the only complaint I have. Food quality and service pulled up the review score. Lots of empty tables, without staff to cover."}
{"text":"Karina, our waitress, was amazing! Extremely nice and made the experience that much more enjoyable. Someone was always around to help us"}
{"text":"Lol I am doing a M****F*****G review on Denny's seriously! Well my EX has ties to this location so he feeds me on his dime. This is the spot when I want breakfast for dinner. I always order the same, an Ultimate omelet no mushrooms, hashed browns, and a bagel w/cream cheese. Um WTF they do not have a Denver omelet on the menu. Who in the world does not have the capability to make a Denver omelet. We are talking ham, bell pepper and onion.  Why not you may ask??? Well rumor has it that to cut cost, they did away with fresh vegetables such as bell pepper. They replaced it with a fajita style bell pepper and onion mix which comes in frozen. They use it for everything now, in 5 or 6 of their menu items. So there is no way to make a Denver because it would taste funky with that crappy seasoned pepper and onion mix (frozen).     Anyhow, I like the free entertainment this location provides! The more low end clientele, homeless, prostitutes, and idiot and ungrateful demanding hotel staff management whom holds their weekly pow wow here. This Denny's is located inside of a motel and casino for the record.  Just getting from your car to the building is an erotica of funk. Always some prostitute yelling at another, and the \"women of the night\" switching shifts on the corner!  I really feel good about myself as I am walking into the casino to the inside Denny's. I said Denny's is horrible, but not as bad as those call girls just on the other side of the door.  The one redeeming quality in this location is that they do have Awesome music bumping every time. I am always doing the booty mix a lot sway in the booth! Lol I do I really do. Then I get hit on by a pimp in which I told to take his baby nuts a walkin before they get let a stompin!"}
{"text":"Dingy and funk.  But when you wake up at 4 in the afternoon hankering for a little something to settle the tummy, this is an easy crawl from anything mid-strip and the all-you-can-eat pancakes will surely ease the hangover.  All for less than $5.  Yay Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday it was busy service was extremely nice and kept apologizing about the wait which I didn't mind and again when I was going to pay my meal but not bad"}
{"text":"Went on evening of 5/17/2018.   When the manager went to seat me I noticed that every other table was loaded with dirty dishes and uneaten food...    the manager had a small child pulling on her apron , yelling Grandma, Grandma.   I spotted an empty booth and requested it, when I slid into the seat I got a hand full of syrup.   When I told her I had to wash my hand , she said I picked the booth and it wasn't ready yet...   I noticed the whole place was warm as if air conditioner broken.  When I returned from washing hand I saw child running around yelling Grandma to manager and decided it was time to leave.  The manager seemed angry as if she wasted time with me , I stated the place was filthy and tables needed cleaned and time for me to go.  She started to yell at me and I said have a nice night I am heading to BOB EVANS !  As she chased me out I also yelled back she must be too busy babysitting to clean the tables.   I was a big Denny's fan until now, won't go back.  I am surprised what ever company owns this location has not picked up on how poorly managed and staffed.   Not to mention small kid running in and out of kitchen area....  I give them a year and they will be closed."}
{"text":"Terrible service :( I have fond memories of Denny's when I was in College but today they all went crumbling down. The server was sassy and seemed like she just drew a smile on her face and went to work but didnt really want to be here. Brought us coffee in a cracked mug that had clearly been leaking since she poured it and brought it anyways. The food took forever and they still messed up one of the 4 orders pretty badly. Pancakes for another one of the orders came after we were all done eating and 3/4 of us eat SLOW. The skillet dish I got was meh. Not flavorful at all- all the right ingredients, quantity and concept but seriously lacking flavor. I think at this point if you go Denny's, go with the safe stuff- the normal Pancakes, eggs and bacon. If so- you'll be ok."}
{"text":"Time for the \"Birthday Grand Slam.\" Other than wrong eggs - over easy not scrambled (fixed) it was a great breakfast. Just wish it was not ONLY on your birthday.  Waiting for them to bring back the BBQ Chicken sandwich on the $2-4-6-8 menu."}
{"text":"Okay so we went on saturday morning. There was about a 15min wait (which was totally fine because its vegas)   the waitresses did not KNOW what they were doing, it felt like they were walking us around the restaurant! DUDE if you call us make sure there is a TABLE.   then they gave everyone a menu but me.  guess they cant count.  anyways after that it was fine. We had good serice from our waiter and he was really prompt and on the ball. Orders were all good and he brought all the sides we asked for.   He also was kind enough to split the bill for a party of 6.  awesome and i would be back.  this visit was oct 14-16.  :)"}
{"text":"DENNY'S OMG thank you very very much!!!! I had to eat here twice on my 4 day stay in Vegas. Everything was great from the service to my T-bone steak n eggs.  We went once during the day and once on our last night. Both times my meal was PERFECT!!!!! Thank you Denny's again it was really hard for me to eat in Vegas but y'all really helped this Texan out!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a hit & miss in regards to service. Came here on a light day as far as customers. The hostess sat us at a booth. Here we sit 10 minutes. No water no drink. Watched the hostess seat a couple. Get their drinks. Serve another table drinks as we sat watching. The server took the couples order she then came to us for our order. I told her about the situation. Tina the server made excuses for hostess that she was helping her with tables. I said but we were here first. I told her the hostess served 2 tables with drinks. Don't care about your excuses. No sorry no comp."}
{"text":"The service on this day was minimal. Lack if servers for the noon rush. The couple in the next booth had their food delivered to their table, they asked for utencils & was told to wait. The food is now cold, they asked to see the manager 5 minutes later he mossies on over to the couple like he was a scared little boy. The female explained the situation as he looked \"dumb\", he finally offered fresh food by that time they were done. They left."}
{"text":"Visible steam coming off those pancakes and I can't help but notice the dollop of whipped butter melting its way to the one side of the short stack.  So good.  All of the food items were served hot and were delicious.  Service was old school friendly and fast, almost to the point where I wondered if I was in a twilight zone sort of experience because this level of service is so rare these days.    This is the newest/nicest Denny's atmosphere I've ever seen.  Had a fun, meandering layout that was clean and modern with mostly booths and a nice coffee shop to the side for those wanting a cappuccino or other item to go.  Cool mixture of people too, as I was surrounded by both blue and white collar workers, a good measure of retired folks, and a few families with children.    Coffee is VERY hot and held in steel thermal carafes that they carry around.  This is a nice upgrade over the old glass pot on a hot plate which is horrible for the coffee.  And, this location has both classic and bold Denny's coffee.  My mug was never empty during my visit."}
{"text":"Located just one block away from ASU West on Thunderbird, south side of the road.  Given the proximity to campus you would expect to see more students but the crowd is more of the traditional Denny's crowd, including senior citizens.  This location is clean and has relatively good service, and the same Denny's food that you'll find at just about any other.  Although there are other restaurants in the area that are local and family owned, sometimes an omelette with pancakes is just what you crave in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Ok, so, I'm one of the mid-day drunks who came here looking to sober up before heading to my afternoon nap in the hotel.  From what I do recall it was very good service, with plenty of water refills, and my entree was quite good.  Nice and clean place, and down to earth prices.  Great place to get some grease spoon food to soak up the alcohol."}
{"text":"Greasy floors, dirty tables. I know they were busy but you have to get the tables clean. And it took a while after being seated before we were acknowledged by the waitress. Also be prepared to be in your neighbors business, tables are really close together. Food was so so. I had an omelet that had a surprise piece of bacon in it. Once again they were busy...Still it wasn't there peak time (Wednesday at the end of September)."}
{"text":"Exceptionally bad service. I go in get seated and wait. l customer enters the store, gets escorted to s table and immeadiately get to place his order and gets service. Me? I got to wait. I left the resturaunt. I did go back a few min later to let the manager on duty know what had happened and that I did not appreciate it. That I was posting a complaint online. Stay clear of this place. There are way too many decent places to eat very nearby to have tolerate bad service."}
{"text":"Looking for an tasty, inexpensive place to shake off the hangover and refuel before starting up again? You KNOW Denny's is the place!  Love the pancakes and the frosty new coffee drinks are delish. Enough of pork and grease here to soak up all the bad toxins.   There's always a line out front, but don't worry, they have the system mastered so it moves really fast, including headsets for the hostess station team.  One of the few places you can grab a big breakfast and not blow the bank in Vegas.  ...Leaving you more dough for the casinos!"}
{"text":"There are numerous reasons for why this review needs to be written & it has everything to do with the night server Kevin. My husband & I both work late night shifts & due to our schedule we both tend to frequent this particular Denny's anytime between 10pm & 2am. Majority of the time over the last year we have become familiar with the servers on this shift, but Kevin in particular. He is always cheerful & extremely attentive every time he helps us, & it has become routine for us to request whatever section he is working because as opposed to being a server we now see him as a friend. Last night my husband & I brought in several of our friends after an evening out for a late meal, & despite them knowing we were familiar with Kevin they could not stop commenting on his great service & happy demeanor. When our meal was done we got in our car & proceeded to drive away. As we were at the light I look over & see Kevin running towards our car sprinting over 4+ lanes of traffic right up to our window! We roll down the window & he hands us a pair of glasses that one of our friends had left in our booth! As you all may know, any server would have just left the glasses at the front desk waiting for whatever patron to call asking for them. I have always appreciated Kevin & his making every experience here awesome, but this really takes it all. He really is an example of not just great customer service, but just being a great person in general."}
{"text":"I could write a paragraph of how bad the food and service was but I'll save you the details, over charged for very bad food."}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has reviewed this new location of Denny's yet because they've been open for at least a month now, and they're open 24 hours! Superwoman and I had been eyeing the sign on the door, waiting for the place to open.  I have to admit that I'm biased though - I'm a sucker for diners.  And I've always been a fan of Denny's in the States (though I tend to go to IHOP more, when it comes to chains I visit south of the border).  I had good experiences here.  I came by one day later in the evening by myself (I think it was a week day), ravenous for pancakes.  I ordered the Lumberjack Slam, which contained a lot of food.  My server was really nice, and the food was great.  Their pancakes were fluffy as clouds, and I like that their scrambled eggs aren't all watered down with milk or overcooked.  The sausages were alright,  the bacon was super crispy (not my preference, but that's ok), and the food came promptly. The toast was good, though I wish there were a wider variety of jams (because my beloved raspberry wasn't available - Cora's really sets the bar high with this). There was also a decent selection of teas.  The next time I was there for breakfast on Sunday morning.  It was super busy, and the service was slower than before.  Also, I ordered a cinnamon pancake breakfast and my server didn't bother to ask what kind of meat I wanted, but she brought me bacon AND sausage so I didn't have to choose, and I was happy about that.  The cinnamon pancakes were fantastic (though not as rich as IHOP) and I didn't need any syrup.  What I love most about Denny's though, is that they put everything on separate plates, so you don't have to worry about getting bacon/sausage oil on your pancakes.  Some people like to mix savoury with sweet, especially with breakfast, but I am not one of them.  I'll be back with Superwoman, and I look forward to trying one of their skillets! (though I wish they didn't all come with bell pepper)  ETA: Someone mentioned below that it was opened only a week or so at the time that my review was written. I walk by all the time and I'd been eyeing the sign for a long time - it felt like a month to me.  Regardless, when they opened is irrelevant and it doesn't change my experience at this place or my opinion."}
{"text":"I ate here 2 times during my vacations at the New York New York. First time the service was great I got a young guy who was very friendly. But this last time the waitress Sonya M. Or whatever was completely rude to my family and I. She threw us the check on the table and walked away. Also she went around greeting the rest of her tables and never once came back to mine. Never brought us more coffee or juice. Completely rude and it made me feel like she was just being racist to us. But the food was great unlike the service."}
{"text":"Service was less than desirable and I understand that they were busy. But having to listen to servers argue over who is going to take you doesn't make the start off good. Ordered nachos and got cut off before we could order drinks. Susan informed us that they were coming off of a busy spurt and that a big table had been sat right before us, ok, I understand. But when we order 2 burgers, nachos come out cold. Started watching kitchen nightmare on our phone. But table got their food. It was 25 minutes later and we still didn't have our food. Asked about it and she said it was coming, again that it had been busy. We then watched 2 cooks go outside to smoke right in front of the door. Yeah. We paid for our nachos and left. Not coming back. Neither will our friends family coworkers etc.  Save your time and money. Buy Spaghettio's. At least they are hot and quick."}
{"text":"Very fast to get seated the two mornings we went. Service was pretty good, didn't matter much since I was eating here to recover from the previous nights! It's Denny's what else can you say."}
{"text":"Great for late night sessions of anything! The booths are more comfortable than the chairs. Sometimes you'll get lucky and be in earshot of interesting conversation. But sometimes this will directly be counteracting your goal of getting some reading done. Another spot to catch high schoolers."}
{"text":"Very disappointing about dennys never came to this Store specially on night only two people working horrible service waiting 20 minutes for service and order"}
{"text":"This location used to suck because it was disgustingly out of date and smelly.  Now it's supa fancy...like, the fanciest dang Denny's I've evah seen ya'll!  But seriously.  They've revamped and it's brand spankin new floors, tables, chairs, etc.  I'm not saying the food taste like a 5 star restaurant but it's helluva upgrade from what it was.  So, if you're looking for a late night spot...God knows we don't have a white castle or that's where you SHOULD be.  So, in the meantime...go to Denny's on McDowell."}
{"text":"At first I was ready to give this place a five star! & then I was disappointed! I was happy with their service at first when they got us seated right away & got our food to the table almost immediately.. So far 5 stars, but then one of girls bumped into my baby's car seat that was on top of the high chair because she was walking so fast and I know she didn't mean too cause I heard her say sorry as she was walking away but not apologizing up front bugged me & I would prefer them to be careful with my baby then rushing the food. After that, we had just got our food and although we got it almost right away the French toast were kinda soft inside and maybe a little undone. Not only that but while we were eating our server brought us the check. I was really hoping for some dessert or a milkshake to go at least but then I felt pressured to leave. And with the bill at our table, felt like it was time to go. I might try this place for a second chance some other time.  I like fast service, but I don't like to be rushed."}
{"text":"Im back, this dennys continues to dissapoint. Two times in a row we have had hair in our food and waiters who leave us sitting here for 20 minutes. Im seriously considering reporting them to a health inspector. Also their eggs are disgusting and unedible. How do you mess up eggs!? I strongly suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I would call this \"The Worse Denny's ever\". However, that title already goes to the one in Downtown Sacramento.  I'll give this one the number 2 spot for worse Denny's.  First the hostess gave our table to another group \"Rob, party of 4...Rob\" (Rob's my friend) the other group had the name \"Bob.\" simple mistake.  It's OK.  Second, I think two of the waitress' were fighting over our table.  Maybe for tips?  I have no clue but they both came back taking our drink order, later our food order, and excessively wanted to refill our drinks every 5 minutes.  Oh Oh Oh!!! I forgot to mention the first server set the expectations low by telling us something I rather not say in fear that a manager reading this and reprimanding her.  Third, our food took 30 minutes to show up.  Fourth, everything tasted warm but on the cold side.  There alot more 'bigger better breakfast' places out there to try.  Skip Denny's.  Nothing great here.  Cheers and Eat Responsibly!"}
{"text":"Went New Years day with our best friends Andrew&Megan.  First time going to Dennys! (back home in New Brunswick we dont have them)  Walked in and was promptly greeted by the manager who allowed the hostess to take our name for a table. Took about 10 minutes. This was the only weirs part because the front doesnt have extra space for people waiting and is positioned by the bathrooms. There was a table of 9 and a table of 5 and us all waiting in this little foyer. Excause me's and so sorry's and may i squeeze by's followed for the next 10 minutes as we were in front of the bathrooms lol pretty awkard.  But once we were seated everything was excellent! Got our drinks fast, loved our waiter. My husband was nursing a hangover and asked for apple juice so the waiter brought it out but in addition to 7Up, i guess it helps? Waiter tip LOL   But got our food pretty fast. I ordered eggs benny - yummmmmmmmmmm. Im so fussy about my holandise and dennys is bang on. So good.  & the pancake puppies! Yummmm deep fried pancake batter dipped in syrup? Hangover delight. So good.   I give dennys a 5, loved this chain restaurant! And its open 24/7!"}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible Horrible service, placed an order to go which was a simple All American Slam Breakfast for two. Upon ordering the employee by the name of Trevor couldn't figure out how to substitute as well as add on to an order needed help from another employee to get my order correct as I thought. Additional to my order I specifically asked Trevor to kindly add red and green peppers to my meal and he stated \"no problem\" which lead me to the assumption that red and green peppers would be added, upon waiting almost 30/45mins when it was slow in the restaurant meaning no heavy traffic of customers a couple that came in after me placed their order and received their food which was a big order that they placed while I'm patiently waiting on a simple meal for two people. Poor service and all I received was a messed up order and a complimentary orange juice my daughter could have freshly squeezed herself! For the people who stumble upon this post please do not go to this specific location when you can just go to the IHOP down the street, and as far as the employee Trevor please take him off of the register and have him sweep the floors or wash the dishes in which he may be more productive don't so!"}

{"text":"Your Valet guy should be terminated! I turned the corner and saw a parking spot before I even turn my turn signal on this valet driver turns the corner with a truck in front of me and backs into the parking spot I was about to park into. What do you need a valet parker for if his going to park the car 5 cars away from the door?? There should be designated valet parking spots that aren't 5 spots away from the door. Horrible!!! an absolute disgrace!!! Just happened 5 minutes before this post if you want to know who your guy is or if you even care about your customers!!! Complementary valet bec your driver doesn't park get and wants a $5 tip."}
{"text":"The Verdict: Go when you have a craving for pancakes or fast food late @ night around CWRU  The Food: Can't go wrong. Got a Grand slam which comes with 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 slices of bacon, and 2 sausages for $6. It fit the bill of your standard fast food breakfast which is what I wanted. I also got a sandwich last time and it was good too! Comes with a lot of fries!   The Extras: Denny's was revamped to \"The Den\" to appeal to college students a few years ago. The difference with the Den is that they don't serve you, you just order and sit down and then they call your name when your order is ready to come get it. It's open very late. It looks like a classic diner on the inside with bar seats and many booths. The cashier is super sweet and nice! It might take a while to get your order but the food doesn't take too long!"}
{"text":"Now that've ordered some Buffalo Wild Wings. Let me just say this. All I wanted was something good to eat. Denny's was right there and sounded awesome right! Although, The waiter had an issue with someone before me or something?!?! because she was not in a good mood AT ALL. This is how it went down. As I casually walk in*  Waiter: Hey , booth or table  Me: ..uhh  Waiter: just sit anywhere .   Me : K  Waiter: I don't care.  *Thats when I decided to walk out and not have to deal with it.   .. Imma go get my wings now"}

{"text":"We are frequent guests to this Denny's location. Very disappointed today. Service by our waitress was great, but a long wait for our food. We ordered cheese sticks and a burger and fries to share. We finally got our food. There was half a chopped up meat patty on our burger. And literally one scrap of avocado. We sent it back and asked for the patty to be an actual whole patty and more avocado. This picture below is the second time it came back. Two times and they still couldn't do it. Had to wait nearly 10 minutes for a manager. Who is now re-cooking our burger.  Not happy."}
{"text":"Came for lunch never been to this location before. Pretty well kept staff friendly food was correct and good."}
{"text":"There's nothing like the 2-4-6-8 menu. Love going here especially because it's never really busy (when you go any time besides breakfast) and even then sometimes breakfast isn't too busy. It's cheap food, so you shouldn't expect much out of it, but to get good tasting cheap meals. I love getting the French toast. Good service, plenty of tables, I've got no complaints here. Thanks for being 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Denny's is a favorite breakfast place of my hubby's. I think because he grew up in a small town where it was the only option. Anyway, we almost never come here for lunch or dinner but for breakfast they are ok. They have added a lot of healthy options to their menu like turkey sausages and bacon and a nice spinach and egg white omelette. This particular location used to be pretty run down but they recently spruced it up a little. The service is kind of hit or miss, though. And it usually is not too clean. But they do get you in and out fast and it's a big place so there isn't usually a wait for a table."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever the host lady at the front had the worst attitude I've ever seen. We had a party of 6 2 of them didn't get their food we all got our food finished and then still didn't receive it. When they finally brought it out they brought the wrong meals then continue to give us attitude and start complaining about how her kitchen is a mess like that's our fault. This is a business and if you can't deliver the service we paid for then I don't understand why the hell you work for a place you Don't wanna be"}
{"text":"Only one girl was working, very speedy and attentive. Messed up 1/4 dishes and forgot toast but the food came out super yummy and fast. I think maybe she is new but she was really nice."}
{"text":"Food was great was ready in 5 minutes, it only the waitress was good at her job as didn't walk past my food 10 times, even after the cool attempted to get her attention... it was cold by the time it got to me.... the worst part is I was the only person in the restaurant with a pending order... it was 1:00am and slow. No that wasn't the worst part, I had to remind her to bring me coffee... the food had been cooked and sitting for a while and there was never an attempt to bring me coffee I had to remind her and then she only had less than half a cup to give me while she panicked to make a fresh pot..... insolence, insolence, insolence .... she had the nerv to call me crazy behind the corner but purposely loud enough to where I could hear. I normally Tip +33% everywhere I go, %20 if service was bad, But it took everything I had to not get up and leave. I had not eaten in the past 12hours,and I had drove 4 hours to get to the cleaveland area, I wanted to get a meal before I got some rest. The waitress ruined my appetite and my evening, no customer deserves that.... Manager knows who I'm taking about, the cook could tell I was felt a lousy hand"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday and I ordered steak and my father ordered it some kind of sandwich when the food was brought out the presentation on the plate look better than what was on the menu the cook there yesterday night rocked that food it was the best that I've had there in a very long time that cook is a keeper I was told the cook's name was Angel also had great service as well I will be back"}
{"text":"My father and love this place. Great friendly employees.  The place is the cleanest Denny's I ever been too. Never no wait and the food is always served nice and hot."}
{"text":"feel good food. real good food. walked in and noticed one waitress running the whole place...almost left. glad i didn't. she did a great job, she handled 16 tables with ease. the food was fantastic. the prices are reasonable. there's always something new. this is my new go-to place."}
{"text":"This place seems to always be busy. At least on the weekends. On my last visit, we had to wait nearly an hour for food because they had only one cook and were training 3 other new cooks.   Other than that, it is simple and straightforward. I do enjoy their skillets and my son is always happy to come here and mix it up. They have plenty of options on the kids menu.  The staff is mostly friendly and I think because they are so busy, sometimes they don't check on you like they should."}
{"text":"Service is okay. No major complaints.   On our visit last night, our waitress was obviously new and she was running around like crazy, so she was busy or at least tried to make it look that way.  Our food is always at least okay. Ordered a half an order of the zesty nachos and I was kinda mad at myself for not ordering the whole order. Those nachos were bomb dot com. I really enjoy the variety of the skillets they have and it is typically my go to order but last night I went with the country fried steak and eggs. Do yourself a favor and stay away, this was so not the business. I ate everything except the country fried steak. We also ordered the veggie omelet and this was stuffed full of veggies. Delicious!  Kids still eat free on Tuesday so that is always nice. And they have a wide variety for the kid's menu. Even if it is not free, it is very affordable for the kids to eat."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical about going to Denny's due its reputation of it being low quality food. As a brunch place, the breakfast was unbelievable. I don't really go out to brunches so I don't have a good benchmark, but I thoroughly enjoyed my salted caramel pancakes. My mouth is just watering thinking about it again (hold your inner food desires, young one).   One qualm: The place was extremely slow, and we waited for the server to come to us so we could pay for at least 10 minutes until I finally decided to just go up front and pay - I get it, they were busy, so I am not going to hold a grudge against them."}
{"text":"Meets \"The Standard\" for Denny's, but friendly service is king.  Not the nicest-looking Denny's on the inside, but has super nice staff.  I've been here several times, and each server made the experience fun.  The food is on par for Denny's.  Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Called in an order for one dinner to pick up Took forever to check out- \"new system\" and the gentleman in front of me didn't help the situation.  My food was sitting there and I was sitting there and we weren't United for a couple min. My order was soggy (I had called from the parking lot to place the order- no way it was sitting waiting for me, it was soggy to begin with) and I was missing my favorite part of ordering the chicken finger dinner- the bread.  Plus- when I said no to the question, \" do I want to add a tip to the card\" the lady's personality changed."}
{"text":"Ordered ice tea, no ice tea.  Ordered iced coffee, no ice coffee.  Ordered green skillet, no avocado.  Service is slow.  Poor management. Poor portions. Don't come here go to Parma town.  Denny's corporate should intervene."}
{"text":"I've passed by this Denny's about 1000 times.  Went in for breakfast with my wife and son and had a Great experience.  Service was excellent, food was good, and atmosphere was ideal for eating and laughing with family."}
{"text":"My friend suggested I visit here during my healthy diet and I didn't know exactly what to expect. Parking is a bit confusing, but after a while you realize you can park anywhere in the commercial part of the plaza. Immediately walking in at 11am on a Saturday, we were greeted and seated. A server was cleaning up the table we were going to sit in when we walked up. The table was clean, but you can see food on the floor (-1 star). To my surprise, there were healthy items on the menu. I ordered the Fit Fare Veggie Skillet for $11.59. It was pretty filling and reminded me that salsa is a great dressing for people on a diet.   Jeffery was our server and visited every so often to ensure we were enjoying our meal. Overall, it was a good meal served in a family type setting and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"They shouldn't even get a 1 Star! Waited an hour and a half for our food. Got our food with hair in it. The waitress said \"oh it's an eyelash\". There was NO apology! Asked to speak with the manager who never came out. Got our food the second time after they re-made it and the eggs were practically raw! Disgusting!! Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"well this place has always been amazing, when hunger strikes you in the middle of the night! Lol  this one over here in Surprise is fantastic, our server Tammy, was excellently amazing! She was serving 10 tables by herself! Their food is yummy as usual. They never fail my expectations, I got some cob salad with some prime rib, and it's mouth watering good!  I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love their smoothies - if you haven't tried one - likely you'll be hooked - I've been there maybe 20 times as I really enjoy the server Cindy - I love her line -;just tell me what you're hungry for and I'll tell you how to order it - to ensure I take advantage of any specials - if you've never tried the sirloin steak and sweet corn - try it - it's like eating at a steakhouse - mgmt will always be moderate when you are paying managers less than waitresses at a Dennys - so to me that Is to be expected -"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday evening at about 9:20 literally only 4 other tables occupied. It took forever to get our order taken and I had to go get utensils from another table because our table wasn't set up.  The server was polite but the place was obviously short staffed because after we came in a few other tables filled up. One server trying to help everyone needless to say service went down hill fast! Our food order sat up on the counter for about 7 minutes before it was brought to us and wham cold food!   I will personally never step foot back in here! Management ought to think about staffing this place rather than saving a buck!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are newly regular here. Our server, Kathy (in case more than one Kathy works there, she's the one with the short hair and red streak), has been nothing short of phenomenal! We walk in and she has us sat in her section, no matter how busy she is. She knows our drink order and food order right when we sit down. Food is great and service is spectacular. We are moving in a couple days to Phoenix, but we will absolutely commute to this Denny's just for Kathy!!"}
{"text":"Came in 3/19/2015 930am 14 tables empty and a 20 minute wait. People were signing themselves in since no one was attending the hostess stand. People were walking out because there was no service and so many empty tables. Plus it was raining outside so everyone was crammed into the lobby area and was highly irritated at each other and the staff."}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff and affordable food/drinks on the strip. You can also catch the mirage's show from their balcony."}
{"text":"This made our second trip to the local Denny's which is a new restaurant in the local area.   The service was not the best as it appeared that they were very slow in taking the order even slower in delivering the order and the food was not fresh.   This makes the second time in less than one month that we had the opportunity to stop by the local, you Denny's restaurant.   We actually ordered salads as our entr√©e plus a drink, Tea.  This location is not up to the normal process that we have seen with Dennys restaurants and maybe given time???  Only if you have enough time to spend...."}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers of mine after work. As soon as I took a seat at the table (my coworkers got there first), the waitress asked me if she could get me anything to drink.  I really wanted some steak and eggs, but my nacho craving won. I got their nachos and they were pretty tasty. Except for the few stale chips that were in the mix. And they didn't serve it on a plate which I thought was odd. I couldn't get to the chips without getting my hands dirty :( I then shamefully started using a fork...  I was lucky to catch my waitress before another big group came in to get my bill. But my coworkers also wanted to get their bills and I think it took them all approximately 30-40 minutes to finish paying. Too bad the other waitress didn't help her as her side was empty."}
{"text":"I came here after seven hours of travelling plus a day of work... I had been up since 3am on the East Coast and it was around 9pm on the West Coast. I had never been to Vegas and I was taking it all in before crashing. Needless to say, I was EXHAUSTED. Lillian took such good care of me... I was so delirious all I needed was food before I stumbled back to the hotel. I was sitting in front of a VERY rude older couple who just weren't pleased with anything, but bless Lillian, she took it in stride (smiling the whole time) and was absolutely wonderful to me. For my very first meal in Vegas (a stranger in a strange land, so to speak), the comfort and fantastic service that she provided was so unbelievably welcome."}
{"text":"Ate here once many years ago on our realtor's dime as we were looking for a house. Don't remember much about that visit, but today's is certainly memorable. Arguments in the kitchen, people in the kitchen slamming plates and glassware very loudly, chaos in the front... Granted it was a busy Sunday lunchtime, but it was just one thing after another, and pretty obvious that management was not in control of the situation.  The final blow came after my wife and I had only gotten our drinks after a lengthy wait, (coffee and orange juice) and had been waiting for food for half an hour only to be told they were out of bacon.  Out.Of.Bacon.  \"America's Diner\" cannot afford to be out of bacon. Rather than get substitutions (turkey bacon or sausage were offered), we opted to leave. Apologies all around on our way out the door, but even though we had nothing to eat, they just left a bad taste in our mouths.  I know Denny's isn't supposed to be a high class joint, but I don't expect that kind of incompetence from what should be a corporate well-oiled machine."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! They are always understaffed and when your food comes out, it isn't even worth your wait. The manager did come over, but only to apologize and say that there are a lot of tables still waiting for food. Politely we all said okay but then we all noticed that he looked disheveled and walking away he was pushing his shirt into his pants.. it looked gross, unhygienic and just plain messy. Our server was very polite but most of us at the table didn't like our food, or it was cold... With so many things wrong, we all left just as hungry as we walked in because almost nothing was edible."}
{"text":"Denny's have menu for those who don't eat pork. That says a lot to me. Prices are also good. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Went there today after taking the wife to the DMV. We were greeted initially by a nice young lady that showed us to our table promptly. Our waitress, Yvette, was prompt on asking us what to drink, bringing our drinks and taking our order. So after ordering, we waited maybe 5 minutes for our food, a double cheeseburger combo and zesty nachos, to be brought to our table. Yvette provided us with refills of water and great customer service. The food was superb, we left pretty full and with a to-go box of nachos (the quantity and quality of nachos is parallel with the price listed). We provided a 50 percent tip for the tremendous service from our waitress. I visited around ~10 am, so I would recommend giving this Denny's a try if you haven't had a good diner experience in Phoenix yet."}
{"text":"I am really happy there is a cheap option to eat on the strip. Having said that, they hide their 2,4,6,8 menu and you have to ask for it. That's not cool.  Naturally, they are pretty busy."}
{"text":"I've probably been here 10 or so times so far. I really like this branch. The staff has always been very nice. The waiters are nice, especially the sharp-looking guy with the half-silver tooth, and both of the night-time managers I've met have been friendly (a lady, and a younger guy). I go to a lot of Denny's, and I think the staff here is friendlier than most.  Food has always been good as well. I, nor my date have ever had any issues with the food."}
{"text":"Well, when I say five stars I don't mean that it was particularly amazing, but I do mean that dang are you getting some awesome bang for your buck here! Where else can you get a full sit-down meal for only a few dollars on the strip?  They do have the 2-4-6-8 menu, but they hide it, just like the Denny's near the MGM on the strip. This option is much better than the other Denny's that are on the strip IMO. This is on the second story and has a beautiful view of the strip if you can get a seat in that area. One of the times I came I got a great view of the Treasure Island (I think) water & fire show across the street.  Sometimes they are kinda busy, and one time our server seemed very new, and the cook forgot a few things, but nobody has ever been rude. If you are on a budget but still want to have a meal on the strip (like me), this is the perfect place!"}
{"text":"Don't come here after 9 pm ..they always seem to be short staffed ... no host to greet you so you'll stand there looking lost for a few minutes before you're seated. There always seems to be one server working and one runner/prep person so the one server is running around like a chicken with his/her head cut off. Tonight our server was Joey and I felt bad for him. The host had been folding silverware napkins since we got there and were ignored for 4 mins until Joey called over to us from near the kitchen to say someone would be right with us when the host was sitting a few feet from us folding napkins .. then when it was time to pay at the register a group of people had already been standing there to be seated for a few mins and myself and my partner had stood there for a minute ... the host while folding napkins called for Joey to assist us as if he weren't already busy with about 5 tables ...she then decided she would get off of her behind and check us out and seat the other guests... this has been my experience most nights that I go ... never again. & change the water you use to wipe down the tables or wash the rags because the table smelled like mildew and sour milk really bad. And the silverware was spotty"}
{"text":"Horrible. My girlfriend and I went in and it was slow. Got seated and wasn't helped for 15 minutes and decided to leave. If I could give negative stars, I would."}
{"text":"I understand that they can be pretty crowded, but i got there at 7:30A both days and had no wait, great food at very, very good prices and excellent service. Staying at the BW Casino Royale made this a really great option. Had veggie omelets both times and no disappointments. they make their money on the coffee, which was plentiful and great. sdm"}
{"text":"By far the worst breakfast I have every had, worse then school cafatiria food. My food was cold so I sent it back, I had to flag down another server and she took it. About 15 min later my server comes over and ask how ever thing was so he didn't notice I had no food in front of me. I said I sent my food back and he says oh I will check on it bit he took another order before he brought me my cold food back, lying saying it was remade."}
{"text":"Great service had the good old grand slam awesome like always. A great cup of coffee and that made the breakfast  what I likethere fast good always clean. Take the time to go"}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 times. The first was just \"ok\".  The second time we waited about 45 minutes for our food.  Our cold appetizer came out with our meal.  The staff kept complaining to the customers about how many staff had called in sick.  The third time we waited at the door for almost 5 minutes to be Sat and no one even glanced at us, including the manager walking around, so we left!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"This Denny's was the worst ever. We waited for 15 minutes and there was seats empty in the back. After being seated the waitress took forever to come and take our order. After placing the order it took forever for it to come out. After scarfing down the cornbread waffle, it took forever for her to bring us the bill. Never again, this was Super Bowl weekend, not at the best at all .. no tip."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but the service was AWFUL when the waitress calls my mother who is a senior \"Honey\" in a negative way NO WAY, Mom ordered a senior breakfast and and did not get the sausage, and when we asked if it was missing the server with an attitude says \"Look Honey I didn't run your order so I don't know\" Then she repeated this again in disgust! Very nasty attitude! Our drinks came after our meal.  So look Honey you won the award for the lowest tip I have ever left in my life $2 bucks, and you didn't really even earn that!"}
{"text":"The food is always great whenever we go to any dennys. Unfortunately we waited for almost 15 minutes for an order (for two people) I ordered the Philly cheesesteak omelet and like always their food is great. Our server wasn't the fastest, she may have been new or just didn't care. When I got my food, she forgot to mention that they were having an issue with the toaster. I assumed that my toast wasn't coming so I asked a manager about that and she found out what was going on. The toast was fairly pathetic. It was not really even toasted and it was dry and hard. The server did ask us twice if the food was okay so I guess that is a plus. I would probably give this place another chance but I would definitely wait till it's a slow day so they can keep up. The two stars was only given because of the food and cleanliness of the restaurant. If you're driving by this area, give it a try. The food is great. The wait.....not so much"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Staff was inattentive and inept. We left after we were seated (and starving) because the table next to us decided to play rap music on their phones and dance at breakfast. All while staff ignored our table. Restaurant was filthy."}
{"text":"All the wonderful ladies work hard to make everyone smile. Today Wendy made my day with her wonderful and cheerful attitude. She is awesome and I look forward to seeing her each time I come in. Happy Birthday Wendy!"}
{"text":"Missed opportunity here! New diner, good brand name reputation...too bad! We were seated and our drink orders were taken and arrived all in good time. Things deteriorated from there. Our waitress was 15-20 minutes getting back to take our orders. On the upside she was friendly and courteous! The three of of us placed very simple orders. We then waited 40 minutes for our two salads and one sandwich order. This was 2 pm and the place wasn't 25% capacity! The problem was our waitress was the only waitress working taking orders and waiting tables. One other girl was bussing and cleaning while the manager was running the register! The kitchen did seem to be keeping up with orders in a timely fashion either! Bottom line...poor management = poor service!"}
{"text":"place is dirty, there is a lot of drama there, and managers are crooked, best not to even go there, they need new waiters, waitresses and managers at that place in order to run better"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Service was great and the food was great. I haven't been the Denny's in years."}
{"text":"I may be in bizaro world but this Denny's was great compared to all the Cleveland Denny's. The decor was actually new and clean.  Not overly packed for a Saturday after hours. Food was out quick and it all was cooked to order. I had the peaches and French toast breakfast. I left satisfied and ready to sleep to catch my flight the next morning. Oh, I forgot, it is morning. Hope I don't miss my flight. Phoenix, AZ is a place I could possibly move to.  Also the waitress offered us a free dessert because the friend I was with did not write in his gratuity correctly. After he thought it was her mistake he then realized it was his mistake. Wow, now that's customer service."}
{"text":"I know it is  Denny's but still. Come on Denny you have competition for good cheap breakfasts nowadays. You used to have a reasonable priced, okay breakfast. What happened? I ate here on 6/4/13 and the coffee was cold, the eggs were ice cold and runny, the English Muffin was raw, not toasted at all and the fruit was actually spoiled. (brown bananas and sour, pruny, moldy grapes, WTH?) The bill was 10 dollars and change. OH MY! The server was nice but overworked. This is not the first time this location has had problems. We used to go here for our welcome back breakfast at school. It was bad. One time it took 1 hour to get my food and I got sick later on. YIKES."}
{"text":"This is a very basic Denny's location in the valley. Service is hit or miss depending on the day of the week and how busy they are. Food is always pretty standard. I can't say I'm ever thrilled to go to a Denny's, but when I have a coupon, I will sometimes go but it's usually against my own will."}
{"text":"This Denny's the service was very slow and they were not busy. The food was mediocre, I did not finish not because I was full, but it was like wasting my time.  I will eat at Denny's again but not at this one."}
{"text":"Working midnites, we will go there after work every now and then. I love this restaurant. Here's why 1.) If u want healthy..tilapia ranchero this is my favorite, with my endless iced tea drink 2.) If u want healthy breakfast they have it too. Got veggies and fruits. 3.) Want fries, I like their flavored fries, no need for gravy 4.) Feel like just having finger food, I had their small nachos, for $7 holy, so good... Got sour cream and dip. 5.) Lastly, their dessert, apple crumble I think its called....yummy. Hot chocolate...endless as well very rich and great when u need something to warm you up. Hope my good experience here entise you and hope you have a good experience like I always do."}
{"text":"It took us about an hr to get our food which was actually ok with us. The staff was short handed that night and the manager Maurice sat us and took our drink orders. Then about 10 mins later he took our order for food. At this point we realized there was only one other employee at Denny's that night besides Maurice. My buddy went to the bathroom and saw in the kitchen that Maurice was cooking everyone's food too. He sat us, waited on us, Cooked our food, and served it too us. All while taking care of 3 or four other tables at the same time. Maurice is a good hire Denny's."}
{"text":"We live near this Denny's and service has been hit or miss so we normally avoid it. I wanted moons over my hammy so we went to Denny's and my husband even expressed his concern. I should have listened. There was one table with 2 people at it, at 9pm at night, that should have told us everything. We stood up front waiting to be seated, there was no one around to seat us. Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn't smile, didn't say I'll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw). Imagine when walked in we were greeted and told they would be right with us. The manager saw us and immediately went to try and seat us while he was in the middle of something. I'm done with the Denny's. You have sealed the deal I won't be back and with the way things looked the restaurant sales won't keep you in business either."}
{"text":"Birthday breakfast at Denny's. My wife and my birthday fall on the same day so it was off to Denny's. for a free breakfast. Not entirely free but close. I believe you hav3e to pay for the coffee. We will go to Denny's when we travel but almost never when we are in town. Their breakfasts is good. Hard to mess up beacon and eggs. They do this well and thee are many, many combinations of eggs and beacon. This place moved from the north east corner to the south west corner a few years ago. Why did they not build it larger. The place was packed with a waiting of over half hour. Maybe this was just a big day since it was my birthday.  The service was excellent the food was good, the place was clean even with all the people coming and going.  Just me but I am not a fan. I eat at Dennys somewhere in the U.S. a couple times a year because I know I will get a good breakfast.  If you are into Denny's this place is a place to visit."}
{"text":"Not my first choice but I was hungry. Losing sight of what was in front of me we needed food and we needed it fast. Stopped off here before leaving Las Vegas. Always okay food."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly good Denny's.  We were heading out of Phoenix but wanted to grab breakfast on our way out and we stopped by here.  Outside, it looks kind of abandoned.  You see signs on the windows and a few people inside, but the lack of cars is a little startling considering every other Denny's is usually jam-packed at 10:30AM.  It's all about the area though.  There isn't a whole lot around here, so I can see how it can be so UN-crowded.  The restaurant was only about 1/4 full so we were seated immediately.  Our server, Nataly, came by very quickly and took our drink order.  When she came back we were ready to order.  5 minutes later, our order was out.  I got the Grand Slamwich and the husband got his usual Moons Over My Hammy.  My sandwich was 1 scrambled egg (more like 4 judging the size of this thing), sausage, bacon, american cheese, and mayo all sandwiched between potato bread that is grilled with some sort of maple spice stuff.  It's very good.  It also comes with a side of hashbrowns.  It's really cheap at only $4.99 but there is also a Super Grand Slamwich.  I don't know how anyone can eat any more.  I only ate half and had two bites of the hashbrowns.  A strange thing we noticed however is the price difference between my sandwich and the husband's sandwich.  They were almost identical in size, almost identical in fillings, and both came with hash browns.  His, however, was $7.99.  Not that I am complaining about price or anything, but I couldn't figure out where that discrepancy came from.  Oh well.  Bottom line, this is a great Denny's with great service, and better than usual food.  It was a nice experience to not be bumping into people and hearing screaming children.  I would definitely go out of my way to stop by this location as opposed to one closer to my house."}
{"text":"Overall, I ate here on two different occasions during my trip to Vegas.  What I enjoyed most about the location was their precision in service.  I was especially surprised since the timeframe we visited was during 11am - peak time, in my opinion.  Great overall experience for me and my family of six!"}
{"text":"a familiar restaurant in an unfamiliar familiar place... Fast service and food was hot!  Hit the spot!  Now,,,, let's go blow $$$ on gambling!"}
{"text":"Yea, I'm giving this Denny's 5 stars.  It's just that you cannot beat them for what they do best.  Late night food.   I mean, I don't know anyone that goes to Denny's just to go to eat at Denny's.  It's usually a toss up between IHOP, Denny's, and Waffle House.   However, Denny's food is realllllly good now!  I did hear about them revamping their menu and really working on improving their food and believe me when I say they did a really good job. Everything I've had recently was very tasty.   Their nachos and cheese fries have this new cheese sauce that isn't the typical Sysco or US Food Service one.  Their fries are a cross between a waffle cut and steak fry, again, never before seen anywhere else.    Give Denny's a chance and try out their new food!"}
{"text":"stop in if you enjoy freezer burned eggs, horrible coffee and have no value for your time.  I was wearing sweatpants and still miserable.  puked most of my meal and didn't flush the toilet"}
{"text":"We arrived at 12:02AM after bowling. The hostess continued a conversation in the back of the restaurant while watching my party and another party wait to be seated. Once acknowledged, we were approached with a very rude and unwelcoming tone. Needless to say, we left at 12:07AM before being seated."}
{"text":"Worst Dennys ever.  The coffee was terrible.  It was at least 2 hours old.  I didn't drink anymore after the 1st sip.  The rest of our party thought the same.  The waitress came every minute asking if we were ready yet but kept saying no rush.  She Did this at least 4 times.  My breakfast was also awful.  I was only able to eat a few bites."}
{"text":"My friend I recently went here to eat. While eating we look out the window and notice a rat climbing on the wall. When attention was brought the manner the staff became to crowd the window in amusement and excitement. I understand it was outside but shouldn't we be more concerned with the fact your food establishment has a rat then how cute it is. One employee tried to alert a manager about the manner but we never saw one come to take care of it. If you ask me it was unprofessional and unsanitary. I will not be eating at this location again."}
{"text":"This place totally sucks. The over-medium eggs had snotty whites. The chicken fried steak is some microwaved frozen piece of yuck. They sat me down at a drenched table, so I had to wait for it to dry. Then, when I was done, I had to wait, and wait, until never getting my check. I had to walk to the front, where my wait person was reading something, totally ignoring me. I'm surprised I didn't some awful coli disease. But, I must say, the overall experience was still better than I get at Hertz."}
{"text":"Love this Denny's. Jesse and Shannon are great! I come here a few nights a week to study. Food is always fresh at any time."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and their customer service is great! No matter how busy they are, they still try to check up on you from time to time.  The food is a bit more greasy for my taste. But if you are in the mood for a huge meal for cheap, this is the place to be. My only complain is the cleanliness of the general seating area. Other than that, I love coming to this Dennys"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch. Cheryl was the server. She was ok.  Food was good. I had the Philly cheesesteak omelette which was pretty decent.  The Oreo Shake was good too. Overall good experience"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Denny's in town in my opinion. The food is good, so even though I always have some sort of problem, I keep giving them a chance. Today, I asked my server if he could substitute the two pancakes that came with my order with one pecan pancake.  He said \"no problem\". My order came with two pecan pancakes with bananas on top. When I got the check, the server charged me extra for the pancakes AND the bananas. We talked about a substitution not an additional pancake order. I discussed the issue with the cashier or manager and not an apology or any attempt to resolve the issue. This is what I call dirty and deceiving practices Denny's. They have a survey that it's called Dennyslistens.com which is good for nothing because they send you a form letter and nothing is changed or improved."}
{"text":"I live in Buckeye and have been there a few times the first few months they were open. The customer service was great each time, the waitress was friendly and the food was what you would expect at Denny's. I'm only giving it 3 stars because they do not have low calorie or fat free salad dressings even though if you look at Denny's web page it list fat free italian on the nutritional content section.    Since I first wrote this review, I left an email on the Denny's webisite about it, A regional manager called me and told me they now have Fat Free Italian and will be getting Fat Free Ranch in a couple day. I am now raising the stars from 3 to 4."}
{"text":"Service is awful at this location. I can't comprehend how there are people waiting for a table when half the restaurant is empty and the tables look clean. I can't understand why the Manager is so incompetent and uncaring about his job. It seems he's accountable to no one and appears to be very self confident there won't be any bad repercussions for his lack of Managerial and Customer Service sills.The servers I saw were apathetic and low energy, and like goldfish they would forget what you asked of them three seconds after turning their backs on you. I ordered the Filet Mignon, medium rare. What I got was a cheap cut of meat that doesn't resemble a Filet Mignon. Besides, it was medium-well done. I could use it as leather belt to hold my trousers. Lackluster food. Lackluster and mediocre service. Not recommended AT ALL. This location needs an intervention from Corporate."}
{"text":"Super slow. Very unorganized. I have a friend who's a manager for other Denny's and he said they are one of the worst.  Food is cold and you never get what you ordered in a timely manner. Ferns like they hate you and don't want to be here."}
{"text":"Customers seem to be the biggest problem here and not the staff!  Heard a server, Elizabeth, have to deal with an extremely rude and hostile customer. Elizabeth held it together!  Who goes to a Denny's and requests 2 burgers and fries DECONSTRUCTED?! Separate plates for everything! You want burgers like that... Eat at home!  Make it your own damned self!  REALLY? AND the customer had the audacity to call her a degrading word in Spanish that I will not repeat. Customer is lucky I didn't go over and punch her myself. Apparently she and her husband do this all the time!   The staff should be commended for holding it together. Elizabeth, Lisa and the 2 Nicole's were great!   Now the creepy older Hispanic guy that I think was supposed to be bussing tables that was standing behind the counter not doing anything but stare at me as I ate.... He needs to go. I don't appreciate being leered at while I enjoy my lunch.   They are a very busy location being right next to the freeway and a hotel. Give them some slack there."}
{"text":"I am mainly basing my rating off of my favorite server here!  Ashley is awesome. I have seen her deep in the weeds with customers and she is always on top of it! I hate it when she is not my server because I know I'm not going to get good service and will be ignored.   I usually sit at the counter and when she is there, I know I will be taken care of.   I have been a server so I am more tolerant than most. But the other servers ignore you here and that's upsetting.   I have also heard other servers snip at her and it was inappropriate. She had a full counter and a few additional tables and no time to do your job as well.   Keep up the great work, Ashley!"}
{"text":"The only reason you come to this Denny's is to dodge Vegas' high prices for crappy food!!! At least here you pay way less money for the crappy food you're going to get!  The service here is almost always terrible.  This place is always packed for breakfast and after the club hours.  If you can, go to the Denny's off of the strip.  Otherwise, just settle for what you get here."}
{"text":"So disorganized and unprofessional. I don't think I've ever seen a place be such a mess. All the staff have all the orders wrong or not ready and had the nerve to be mad at the customers that had been waiting for an absurd amount of time for their food. Horrible management, staff and food."}
{"text":"This Denny's has the best servers. Especially Fernanda, she's great - she'll remember your meal order if you've only been there 2times. She's attentive & Professional. Excellent server. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I try to avoid Denny's but sometimes when you're on the road you don't have a lot of great choices. Our hotel had a free breakfast but since we got there at 3:30 AM we didn't feel like getting up before 10 for it ; )  So off to Denny's for breakfast we went. It was fine, we all had standard breakfast fare: eggs, bacon, pancakes, yada yada. Hash browns were not greasy, but also not very flavorful. Waitress was nice and friendly but a little slow on the refills. Overall it was a typical Denny's experience."}
{"text":"This dennys is the best only because its in Las Vegas & you're allowed to drink while you eat here!! That is so awesome, of course its on the strip so drinking is a given. But none the less awesome. As always they definitely offer great food."}
{"text":"I I wish I could give this place three negative Stars. It wasn't packed, took10 minutes to seat us. people came in after me and got their food before we got ours. I had to say something before I got my food I'm pissed and his place fucking suck the service is straight bullshit. She tried to blame the cook for  why she suck at her job..... No tip for her."}
{"text":"Worst dennys experience ever all around fuckery frm the cooks to servers......skip this one"}
{"text":"The staff is doing the best they can with what they've got. I think the restaurant was a little understaffed to handle the steady pour of customers. My server was very polite, looked like he was working fast; however everything took a long time to get to me. As a result, the poached eggs I ordered cake out medium... regardless, I am giving the restaurant 4 stars because my bacon was crispy, English muffins were perfectly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside and like I said, the staff was extremely nice. I will probably prefer to drive a little further to get here than put up with the negative attitude that \"welcomes\" me at the Craig Rd. location...  Updating my previous review of 4 stars to 5 because I have been receiving consistently great service by Ray and his manager Marvin every time I visit this location. My #1 Denny's choice in Las Vegas for sure. On a side note, I would also like to thank the anonymous chefs in the back that help make this a 5 Star review! You guys are the best!"}
{"text":"So this location used to be my favorite late night restaurant. Had an awesome crew and they really took care of the customer. Last three visits I left the restaurant without receiving any food and this time was not even seated in a timely manner. I personally think a crew change from management down would be a welcome change to the place. What happened to customer service in this country it definitely walked out the door at this location and I am not sure if they can fix it."}
{"text":"Ok a mile down the road made a big difference. Denny's at Flying J's failed miserably. This location the waiter had us seated in 30 seconds and drink order shortly there after. Our food was great and my glass was full most of that time. He was hopping and took care of six tables at same time. Only saw 3 tables in use at other place. Really think the other place could learn a thing or two training here with this guy."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite Denny's. Not only do they have all the normal Denny's food, but they boast a full bar and an amazing Bloody Mary(it comes with a stick of bacon in it!)  The service is amazing. You can even sit outside and people watch on Fremont. What more could you need?"}
{"text":"Kids eat free on Saturdays and Tuesday evenings. The service is always pleasant. The atmosphere is cozy, cozier than most Denny's."}
