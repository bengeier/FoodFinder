{"text":"We had dinner here last night. We had the calamari, garlic knots and Fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken. Tasted great and for the price, the portions were large (2 adults shared everything and had leftovers). We will be going again and trying out other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Well I gave this restaurant another chance! Its close to Skybrook. We get there at 6:45 and only three tables. Get seated fast but no one comes by or says hello. Finally waitress ( very nice young lady) takes our order. Cheese pizza and a large salad. Small salad is delivered. We remind waitress that we ordered large salad she brings another small salad. Pizza is delivered, very thin with hardly any cheese. One of the worst pizzas ever. We are done with this place. Gave it many chances!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Poor hostess service and the manager made us feel that our money wasn't good enough to request a slightly better service. The only good moment was with the waitress, she really was nice."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Charlotte. Freshly cooked authentic Italian meals cooked when yuou order, and done just right. Owner is a Brooklyn native and is very approachable and appreciative of your business. Ambiance is great inside and out. VERY impressed."}
{"text":"3 stars for customer service... 4 stars for food...
 
I have been looking forward to trying this place out. The previous restaurant in this location was pretty bad and my husband and I would love a go-to Italian place close to the neighborhood. We decided to order takeout instead of dining in. 

When I called the order in, they said the food would be ready in 15-20 minutes. We got there within that time frame and the food STILL wasn't ready for close to 25 more minutes! It was really frustrating having to wait twice as long as we were quoted. The bartender and floor manager both asked if I wanted a drink while I waited. I declined, but I did appreciate the gesture. 

When my food FINALLY came out, I asked if there was bread with my order. The bartender said they forgot to include it and went to get some for me. When she came back, she said that they had to make some and that it would be a few MORE minutes. Well I had already waited long enough and my husband and baby were waiting in the car, so I just left without it. It would have been understandable if we went at a busy time but there were only 2 tables seated in the entire restaurant when we went. NO ONE acknowledged the inconvenience (not even the floor manager) and that's just bad customer service. I wasn't looking for a handout but it would have been nice to hear, \"We're sorry that you had to wait so long for you food.\" 

Aside from the long wait, I will say that all of the food was very good and the prices are reasonable. We tried their pizza,  spaghetti, chicken parm, garlic knots, and mini cannolis. With major customer service improvements, this restaurant should do well in our neighborhood. 

** Be aware that they charge a $3 \"carryout fee\" that they DO NOT mention beforehand (When I noticed the charge and asked what it is for, I was told that it is a \"packaging fee\"). Also, if you order online, there's an ADDITIONAL $1.25 \"online ordering\" charge **"}
{"text":"Was one of the longest waits I've experienced in quite some time.  Front manager had no regard for concerns.  Seemed to sit individuals they knew before customers who had been on the wait list for a long time.  You can hear the lady at the front desk asking if new customers had reservations with the answer of 'no' only to have the front manager to sit them shortly after.  Was very frustrating.  A little over an hour, was finally seated (only a party of 2!)   The food was not moving out of the kitchen well so was making the wait time much, much longer than shared.  The food was semi-ok.  Not worth the wait and the service received.  Noticed a table that didn't seem to each much of their food where the waitress was picking up their plates and the food was not being boxed to go.  Lots of challenges at this place.  Hope their 'preferred customers' can keep them in business."}
{"text":"The service was very good. We had a 40 minute wait for a table (Thursday night) but we sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive. The food was good not great but nice atmosphere. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Have given them several chances.  The service is awful and the food except for Chicken Parm is meh.  Each time we have sat at the bar and service has been bad.  Tonight the bar tender gave us water then walked away. No hi no would you like a drink.  Then came back and said would you like to order your food.  We asked could we get a menu of both food and beers?  He brought menus over and the first couple of beers we ordered he said oh we no longer have that.  Finally we got beers they had.

In a side note vodka was getting infused with pineapple in a container by us.  There was a lady who seemed to be training the bartenders.  We asked her about the pineapple and vodka and she said that it had not set nearly long enough but they prided themselves on creating their own mixes that were fresh.

Food wise the chicken parm was good.  The linguine in clam sauce was just all oil and tasteless.  Tonight we had a pizza.  We ordered the sausage with peppers.  it took 55 minutes to get and then came out with sausage peppers and onions.  While we sat at the bar a couple came in and said they were waiting for a table.  Then we watched with them as other couples came in and got tables.  They left in disgust. 

People behind the bar seemed to have no clue.  When our pizza came out we had to ask for plates and silverware.  The bartender said no problem then proceeded to take payments on food so we had to wait even longer.  Then when they offered plates they were dripping wet so we asked if we could get dry plates and they brought them to us.

All in all they have a long way to go to be a quality go to place."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm Italian and this food is real Italian, trust me. I went with 4 of my family members and we got appetizers, meals, and desserts and it wasn't super expensive! I really enjoyed the food. The best is the calamari and bruschetta."}
{"text":"My sister and brother-in-law are visiting with my husband and me this weekend.  We decided to try a new place for dinner and landed at Basilico Italiano.

What a FANTASTIC place - great atmosphere, wonderful menu, delicious food, and impeccable service!

We shared the sausage stuffed mushrooms and an order of meatballs with ricotta baked in sauce  and garlic knots for our appetizer.  All were delicious.

Entrees were generous and well presented.

Our server, Sarah, was attentive, professional and so friendly.  She really added to a wonderful experience at Basilico Italiano that we look forward to repeating often."}
{"text":"The lasagna was excellent.  Great flavor and just the right ratio of noodles to filling.  The service was very good, too--attentive but not intrusive."}
{"text":"Super yummy.  Not the chain Italian food here at all.  

Loved the bruschetta, chicken Marsala, Cesar salad and pizza. 

Huge portions but the leftovers will be taken home.  

Good eats."}
{"text":"Probably the best entrees in the area.  Service,  food portions, food quality,  atmosphere, wine, bread, and deserts 
an A.  I have had slightly better sauce in NY, but it is very high quality.  It is all about the sauce. I think I am qualified being Italiano myself."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food and great portions. Homemade meatballs and delicious red sauce. They have a large selection of wine and a full bar. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well.

With a manager on a cellphone chatting in corner it's easy to see why our experience was what it was.

Came around 7pm, several tables open.  Server friendly, promptly brought drinks and a mini focaccia.  The focaccia is the same I buy at Costco for sandwiches-about 3 inches by 3 inches.  

We quickly order stuffed mushrooms and a wedge salad with bacon on the side.  Salad arrived with bacon.  Blue cheese dressing was room temp and tasted like it was from a grocery store.  They were generous in giving me 1 and 1/2 cherry tomatoes though!

Server never took our entree order and after 55 minutes sitting we decided to skip it and have our entrees and dessert elsewhere.  

Thanks but no thanks!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Wonderful food, wonderful service and a great bar. So glad to have this new neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"We had our parents 75th birthday party there last night. There was about 25 or 30 of us counting children of all ages.  They got us set down right away, reservation was at 4:30. We had to wait staff. The food was excellent. Everything took the right amount of time. Everyone was very pleasant. We did not feel rushed. Either the owner or the manager not sure which greeted us made us feel very comfortable. From understated everybody was pleased with their food except my mom she had chicken Alfredo she just wish it had a little more sauce on it.  I do agree that is desserts was overpriced two scoops of ice cream for nine dollars that was a bit much.  But I think everything else is priced fairly. The one thing I did like about this as big as our group was late did not add a tip into the total so of course they got extra! Thanks to everyone there for making my parents birthday extra special."}
{"text":"I like this place I have only had take out and the food is so good when I have gone and ordered food to go yes it takes some time but the people working there are so nice and interesting I don't even realize the wait I will say that when eating in I believe you get more food so I'm looking forward to eating there it is a new place so I know it will get better for now I love the food and the people are great"}
{"text":"First of all we came here at 11 because based on the hours they open at 11, nope they open at 12. Mary one of the managers asked if we wanted to come in have a glass of wine and wait. Why yes Mary we would thank you, since I almost got a ticket for running a stop sign that I'm pretty sure I stopped at but I digress. We came in got a tour since they've only been open for a few months and had a glass of one of the best Moscato's I've ever had. The bread was as it should be nice, soft and warm and my pasta the Pesto was awesome. Mrs. Nancy was super sweet and made us feel right at home. This was actually the best mistake of the year!! They mentioned they are expanding soon to include a pizza and sub shop next door. They have a patio and party/wine room! I will be coming back and that's saying a lot because I live in Ft. Mill!!"}
{"text":"We actually stopped in during their soft opening. Staff was friendly & attentive. Our food was delicious & the portions were huge. I had a second meal the following day. I'm happy to have an Italian restaurant nearby & looking forward to trying out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I was the first to review this restaurant back in February 2017 when it first opened.  We had gone in 3 times the first 2 weeks and looked forward to repeated good experiences.  However now it will not our list for dinner or pizza.  The service is poor and slow, the food is of lesser quality and the pizza is worse than frozen pizza.  It is a shame that they had such a wonderful start and let it slip downhill.  Basilico may improve but the last 3 times we have tried it prevents us from going back.  3 strikes and your out!!!

{"text":"I really like this restaurant! The food is very good but what makes this place special are the servers. They are very friendly and very attentive.  We need more non-chain restaurants in this area so I ambvery happy to have them!"}
{"text":"When they first opened, both food and service was much better.  In the last month, things have gone downhill fast.  Really too bad, but they had potential.  They have reduced their portions while raising prices and service has gone from pretty good to terrible.  At first, they just too little staff and of course, they were all new.  But now, they have people tripping over each other, but they are unconcerned with the customers.  Just go through the motions.  It appears that the ownership may have changed already.  New wait staff, new chef, new managers, new menu items, new prices, but it's not working."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for pasta at 11am. Yelp came up with this place. Well, thinking they opened at 11am, we arrived around 11:20am. They didn't open until 12pm. Mary, a manager, and Nancy, saw us at the door and allowed us to come in. They offered us bread and wine. We couldn't resist. Their customer service has been amazing. More businesses should be like this. Thank you for the amazing hospitality and wonderful lasagna!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews about the service. Thought it might have been exaggerated....but they were right. One couple in front of us at 7:30 on a Friday night. Hostess quotes 15 min. We were finally seated 45 min later. During this time we watched the 3 hostesses eating with their fingers while hiding behind the hostess stand. After we were seated someone brought bread and water. We sat for another 25 min without anyone else coming to the table. No drink order, no food order, no greeting. We got up to leave and told the hostess why. They asked several times who brought our water. We didn't remember. Not that it mattered. They should know who the server was for that table. Hostess says, \"I hope we do better next time.\" Nope. Sorry. No next time. I read reviews that the food was good, but they need to get the rest of their business together. Service is as important as the food. Hostess should have offered to get the manager. AND while we were waiting, a lady who appeared to be somewhat in charge chased some men to the parking lot and asked if their service wasn't good because they hadn't tipped. They all said they had tipped over 25/% on the credit card. Just doesn't seem like a place I want to try again."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food was great and the price was reasonable. It is very conveniently located and very nice inside. We had alfredo and chicken Marsala and both were really good. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"So it's true. The wait at the bar isn't great. We sat down and the bartender seemed to not see us. He poured some drinks for the servers and then the bartender and some sort of manger and a waitress started to have a small argument which was kind of weird, we had to flag him down to get his attention which was also weird bc we were the only people at the bar at that time, we actually discussed giving it a couple more minutes and then leaving to go somewhere else. We ordered a medium pizza which was enormous and delicious, when I tell you the cheese stretched from the pizza to the plate I do not exaggerate, it was beautiful. It was very good and fresh and tons of good quality cheese. The bartenders lack of attention to us or try to engage us at all was a turn off and I'd probably get take out next time."}
{"text":"I hate to have to leave a review this poorly, but the experience tonight that the Highland Creek Playgroup Mom's night out tonight was absolutely terrible. We were seated after a short wait around 7 o clock, there was six of us. For whatever reason, it took almost 75 minutes to receive dinner, while tables around us came and went. Our kind waiter kept telling us that it would be soon and then eventually that they had a large party in the side room and that the kitchen was backed up. We ordered appetizers and waited and watched the majority of the staff watch the NFL Draft on the Bar television. When asked if we would be allowed a discount for the wait time or the Alfredo that was literally thinner than milk, we were told by a very rude young lady who identified as a Manager that she wouldn't refund or discount anything because the Mom that ordered it ate it. (What was she supposed to do send it back and wait another hour for food?) The Manager than spent another twenty minutes splitting our check and was extremely frazzled. It was clear that she hadn't been in a leadership role where she had to deal with relationships with customers for very long or if ever. While all this is going down, the waiters are literally fist pumping to the draft on tv. Other than the Alfredo sauce, the rest of our dinner was great. However; the quality food will be ignored for the awful service. Our poor waiter just stood there and watched his manager almost ask a group of six Mom's to leave because she was angry. The kicker for us is that the manager said that it was a Family Run business and that the owner was present. When one of the Mom's asked to speak to him to make improvements or fill out a card was the manager's tipping point. The owner on site proved to be false as we asked again in front of other staff and the manager then admitted that he was not present but was at some point.
To the owner- I'm sorry your manager was having a bad night, but she needs training in customer relations, integrity (you clearly weren't there from 7-9:20 when we were) and how to diffuse stressful situations. Hopefully she can take this experience and grow or find herself into a different career field. Best of luck in your adventures!"}
{"text":"Everything was great. Ordered the bruschetta for an appetizer and it was great. Could tell it was freshly made. The linguine with clams was amazing! Lots of clams and great taste. Not too oily. Also we had the lasagna and it was delicious. Just like you would get from your grandmother's Sunday dinner. The sizes were great and prices were great too."}
{"text":"Potential to be very good or great but service suffers because of under staffing.

Went here today for Sunday Brunch and I must stay, the place has potential but during our visit, we only saw two employees and service suffered as a result.

We walked in about 12:30 on Sunday. We got out of Church at 10:30 but restaurant was listed as not opening till Noon on Sunday so went shopping first. No big deal.

We walked in and there were a couple of tables occupied but no employees in sight. Finally a gentleman came out who I assume was the Owner/Chef and told us we could sit anywhere we wanted and our server would be with us shortly.

We found a table, sat down and waited and about 4 minutes later, he showed up. Restaurant started to get other patrons as well but our server and the owner were the only two employees we every saw.

Our server brought our menu, and took our drink orders and when they showed up, my wife sent her coffee back because it was cold. A/C was working a bit two well so hot coffee would have been welcomed.

Looking over the menu, not expansive but still provides a good range. Generally portion sizes are offered in two sizes, Full (Individual) and Family which I assume they are trying to do a variation on Buca De Beppa.  Both of us ended up ordering the Full size since there were only two of us.

My wife ordered the Chicken Francese but she asked if they could hold the pasta and let her have a Side Salad. My wife is Our Lady of the Perpetual Diet. Compliments to restaurant in permitting her to do this. Good Flexibility.

I must be related to Garfield the Cat because I ordered my favorite, Lasagna. It was very good with a good meat sauce and surrounded by a tangy Marinara. Only down side was that the pasta was a bit dry indicated that while probably homemade, it had been made previously and had been reheated. Still it was very good and I ate it all.

My wife also liked her salad in that it was a nice balance between greens, veggies and a nice tangy dressing. The Chicken Francese at least according to here was excellent.

The Cuisine on the whole was very good and I would return for that alone.

Nice atmosphere and there is a side room available that could accommodate a nice private party, business meeting or civil meeting.

This is one of those places you want to see exceed because the food is good but they need to  focus on the rest of the aspects of  hospitality such as service. The one server present did an excellent job in trying to fulfill this role but he was only a party of one."}
{"text":"The Chicken Marsala and bruschetta was excellent.  The kids portions were big. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"It is ok. Pizza is a bit overpriced. I was not impressed with the margarita as it was a bit dry.  The chicken bacon was good. The chicken Marsala was decent but a bit over priced and is it was just served with pasta. I am not in a rush to go back"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for my husband's birthday and it was amazing.  Gabriana was our server and she was very attentive and helpful.  We had a few different dishes and all were amazing. The chicken marsala was great and my husband loved it and was definitely fulfilled by the amount he received. Thanks for making his birthday dinner amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Vodka sauce is legit! Live music. Veal Parmesan was fantastic. Calamari was great. Cookie and ice cream for the kids was perfect. Spaghetti and meatballs were excellent. Warm and friendly atmosphere. We plan on returning many times."}
{"text":"Went back on a Tuesday. Have to say service was great and finally able to taste food fresh out of key tV hen. Pizza was excellent and Stromboli best one I've had in years.

Will be back."}
{"text":"We decided to go here yesterday due to the good reviews on Nextdoor. Unfortunately we will not be going back. We ordered the tenders kids meal for our toddler. The chicken was raw. Completely raw. Unsure how this happened but glad he didn't bite into it."}
{"text":"Went here 2x hoping their food would get better but unfortunately that was not the case...actually got worse. First meal was Chicken Picada.....not even close. Sauce was runny & hardly any mushrooms. Second meal should have been a no brainer for a decent Italian joint...... spaghetti & meatballs. The meatballs were mushy & flavorless......sauce was mediocre at best. 
Called to give our feedback to the manager & she she didn't give a hoot one way or the other. Nice....."}
{"text":"To begin, \"Basilico Italiano\" is a great authentic feeling Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is vibrant and very clean with classic music playing in the background. The food was very good and fresh while having an amazing flavor. I recommend the chicken Parmesan pizza, while having a classic pizza taste the chicken definitely adds amazing flavor to it. 

The downside of this restaurant is the wait. We walked in and were immediately seated, however once we were seated and had our orders taken it took 45 minutes to an hour to get our food. This place has the potential to be very good and I hope it succeeds."}
{"text":"I visited here yesterday for lunch.  The bar tender was attentive and the suggestions for wine were on point.  The service was great and the food was good.  I enjoyed the chianti.  This location is close to home and the service was great!  I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I will never step foot into this place again. I made reservations for 8 at this place. I said that to the hostess when I arrived and she said okay it'll still be a 15 minute wait... fine I'll deal. There's very little standing room in the front of the restaurant and no kind of seating for waiting patrons. While waiting to be seated, a lady came up and reminded the hostess that she had a 7:30 reservation and still had not been seated...it was 8:45. My friend and I found a seat at the bar, I had on heels and was tired of standing. The bartender was not attentive at all. The first wines we ordered were not available so we picked something else. The wine came right off the shelf, very warm and the wine wasn't good. The garlic knots they give you are not good. Very little garlic taste to them. I ordered penne noodles with vodka sauce, it was supposed to come with sausage however there was not any. My friend ordered veal.. she hated it. Another bartender approached us and asked if we wanted the food boxed. We declined and she just gave us a blank stare after we informed her we didn't like it. The hostess came over and rubbed all over me awkwardly then offered to let me hit her...strange. She tried to offer us new food but we didn't feel like waiting nor were we interested in trying anymore of their food. They offered a cookie skillet and I accepted because I planned on getting one before the food was so gross so this lifted my spirits only for them to come crashing down again. Even the cookie skillet was subpar.  This visit made me so sad but I appreciate the hostess trying to salvage the night."}
{"text":"First time here I had the chicken parm, it was really good and a 'family' portion was enough for two plus leftovers. Last visit we had the lasagna and a side of meatballs and it was even better than the last time, I'd go back for the meatballs (topped w a dollop of fresh ricotta) alone!"}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch and I couldn't have been more pleased with the service & delicious entrees! The eggplant, signature salad, & French onion soup were phenomenal! Great food & service!!! Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was great. Huge portions everything you'd expect in an authentic Italian place. Our service was incredible with Kameron. Other tables seemed to wait a long time but we could not say enough about our server he made the experience. They need to add a tiramisu option on the dessert menu!"}
{"text":"We went in to this place with an open mind. Terrible, terrible service. I have opened 5 restaurants in my food industry days and it has never been more obvious that this staff wasn't trained. We waited to be greeted for 11 minutes. Asked the manager what was up. The server kept blaming other people for not running our drinks or bringing bread. Not sure what's up but they need to train this staff again. The food was delicious but the dead weight needs to be weeded out. I feel like many of the servers there, this is their first serving job. If we have to ask twice for our wine, that drink should be comped. The manager was well aware of the lack of service and didn't offer a complimentary drink or appetizer, which I know is the industry standard. The managers need to attend a refresher course on customer service and the wait staff needs to be reevaluated."}
{"text":"Came to eat at an Italian restaurant that doesn't serve pasta? There are two sections of this restaurant that are named the same and share a kitchen, but will not serve the same food. There was an hour wait to sit in the formal dining section and only one tv that was not playing the game we wanted to watch (understandable). We were told if we went next door they could serve us pasta since there was no seating in the dining room. We went to the other side (which is much more like a pizzeria) and asked if we could order off of the dining room's menu and were told no. I told him there was another person in the restaurant with food from the dining room and they also told us we could next door since there were more tv's and less of a wait. Still...firm no. He stated he knew it was confusing since they're owned by the same person and share a kitchen, but they are not able to serve food from the dining room. We simply wanted pasta at an Italian restaurant. Maybe Italian shouldn't be in their title on the side that doesn't serve Italian."}
{"text":"We will never dine at this restaurant again!  We put our name on the list and was told it would be 15 minute wait. After seeing several guests who arrived after us being seated before us, and we were only a party of 2, I walked in and found out they had forgotten us. We were seated and had to wait 25 minutes later before someone even addressed us. We ordered immediately as we knew what we wanted. The same waitress came back 25 minutes later and asked if we had ordered!  She had lost our order and didn't remember taking it!! Others around us were being served and we felt humiliated and less than wanted in the business. The waitress offered a  \"free\" appetizer due to the wait......it never came. We then asked for the manager because at this point we had been waiting with no food or water for 50 minutes. The owner asked us to stay and he'd take care of us. What a joke. 25 minutes later the food arrived and mine was wrong!! A simple blackened kale Caesar salad and a chicken Marsala....basic food and it was a problem. The manager happily delivered the check for payment with an attitude of \"anything else\"??'!!!  We then waited 15 minutes before the waitress came to pick up the payment while the manager/owner sat at the booth next to us chatting with family!! He totally ignored us!  

After he left the table, his family turned to us and told us he was their brother and apologized for the bad experience. They said he was \"trying\" and to give his business another chance. He didn't even have any care about our experience enough to address us. They then delivered the owner/brother a cake and sang happy birthday in celebration while we sat like fools!!! Humiliated!! 

I will never spend another dollar to support this business. Avoid it at all cost. We had to pay full price after this POOR experience."}
{"text":"I have only been to Basilico Italiano once so I'm sure I will more than likely update this review at a later time given all the chatter about slow and bad service, but for the time being, I am giving them five stars.  Myself, my husband and our two boys went to dinner on a week night awhile back.  The place is small, so I am sure that the wait times are very long on the weekends.  The layout could be more streamlined.  It is somewhat awkward walking from one side of the room to the other as the bar is directly in the middle.  You have to contend with bar stools and people trying to get a drink while following the hostess to your seat.  As far as the food goes, my picky six year old loved the kid's spaghetti and meatball.  The meatball was probably three inches around.  Hubs loved his Chicken Marsala.  Said it was one of the best Marsalas he has ever had.  Totally authentic and homemade.  My teenager and I split a family portion of the penne ala vodka and we had enough left overs the next day for lunch.  Extremely pleased with our first visit.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the calamari and vodka penne. Both were excellent. We sat at the bar and service was excellent as well. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Place has gotten better and better with time... has a fantastic patio to sit out front on the sofa and have drink..or a romantic porch in the back..underrated and has huge potential if they continue doing what they are doing.."}
{"text":"Excited to try new restaurant tonight.  Was busy, waited for an hour with family and in-laws and noticed others that came in behind us were being sat.  Understand if it were smaller parties, however when there was the opportunity to seat us and pull two tables together the lady sat her friends who had confirmed no reservations at check in  would be seated first.  They had  been there all of ten minutes.  So after ignoring our concerns, after seeing several customers seated who arrived after us. after waiting a little over an hour with  70 year old in laws, we finally left and went up the street to another Italian restaurant.  Will never return.  Also posted comments on their Facebook and they selectively deleted  and kept the positive from other customers.  Thank you Yelp."}
{"text":"They say lightening doesn't strike twice, but 'they\" haven't been to this poorly managed wanna-be restaurant yet. I figured they could knock off the dust after a half-year since the last experience, but no such luck. We left the 3-year old in capable hands of others and set off for this 'establishment' for a nice, local dinner with the two older children - this is an experience that we are afforded maybe once a year. Our joy of being baby free for one night soon turned into...well, here we go. Went fairly early for dinner and there was about 3-4 tables. Got our waters (still no ice) and ordered. The place slowly got busier, but it was comfortable. The calamari appetizer came right out - pretty good. About ten minutes later the kids food came out. Kids ate the food in about 15 minutes and the plates were taken away - still nothing for the adults. Wife had a simple Caesar salad and I had a Stromboli - check that, we ordered a Caesar salad and Stromboli. After 40 minutes waiting, and asking for the owner to stop by, the owner came out five minutes later with the small Stromboli, but no salad. We kindly informed him that we were not going to accept the food (where was the salad?) and asked for the check for the child's meals and drinks. The owner stated that he was told to bring he kids meals out first (not at our request as we were trying to enjoy a FAMILY dinner - must have been the waitress watching the kids food sit on the warmer). Then he stated he had a 'packed house' (busy yes, packed no) and implied that a wait was expected. Come the crap on man - you own a restaurant and it's a Friday evening on a holiday weekend and the outside seating isn't available due to rain. As a restaurant owner, you should plan for the worst case scenario - and yes, I heard your bread served apologize to two other tables about the bread shortage. Besides, it was slow when we ordered and plenty of other tables were getting there food that sat down after us. So sorry - I wasn't buying the arrogant excuse. He did waive the meal and we walked out. The same restaurant ruined two family dinners in less than half a year - I will never step foot near this hole again. I should him the bill for that Harris Teeter rotisserie chicken we picked up on the way home. I hope the third iteration of this space is a quality restaurant that serves the Highland Creek Skybrook area. Thanks for ruining a family dinner."}
{"text":"We just visited there last night for the 1st time. We had a great experience, the food was outstanding, I'm very glad we have something like this in our neighborhood.  We had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer, the chicken francaise as our main course. A good recommendation Would-be to get a side of vodka sauce to mix in with any plain pasta that you're given. It's only a $4 upcharge in really takes it to a better level."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely has potential.  It is situated in a great location in suburban north  Charlotte however on this night there were some things that need to be brought up.

Our waitress did pretty well even though she was new.   When asked about the bourbon selection she included Johnny Walker as a bourbon and did not include Makers Mark which could be seen on the bar.  They also were out of the more expensive Chianti but not a problem.  The other members of my party enjoyed their wine and double Tito on the rocks, however they did not have any Olives stuffed with blue cheese.

We ordered a Caprese salad and when it was brought out the ingredients were totally wrong.  A traditional Caprese salad has Arugla, Buffalo mozzarella,  tomato, and basil.  This version was Argula, Red peppers, and shaved parmesan.  When questioned about this, the manager woman, who I assume was a manager said, said no, this is the Caprese.  My wife pulled up the online menu and the manager stated they were out of Mozzarella.  She then took the salad back and put on a few cherry tomatoes.  Again this did not change the salad and she almost argued that this was how the salad should be.

The rest of the meal was fine.  Good pizza, great spaghetti and meatballs etc.  

Overall it was decent, improve on bar knowledge,  remember to refill water more consistently, and review what makes a Caprese salad."}
{"text":"Have been back 2 more times since my original review. Food was great but the service the past two times was lacking. Waited 15- 20 minutes when there were several open tables; bartender ignored us both times when we went to the bar for a drink while waiting. Server was okay, polite but not attentive. Will go back again because food is good. 

Looking forward to enjoying the lovely patio seating they now have once the weather cools down!"}
{"text":"This is NOT NY style pizza. You're better off going to Cici's. Barely any cheese and just hard crust. NY style pizza should be foldable too. It wasn't. The last time we had their pizza it was delicious. I am assuming they are under new management as they have completely changed the entire menu. And they have 3 sets of doors to get into the restaurant. We went to the first set and nobody was at the front or bar area. We ended up walking to the next room over and found another counter. Also, when we called it in, the girl said 30 minutes. We got there after 20 and it was ready. Wasn't even hot at all. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food. Everything is fresh. Everything is delicious. We shared the stuffed mushrooms (almost as good as mine), a wedge salad (think they cooked the bacon to order, not stingy with the blue cheese crumbles), and linguine with clam sauce (needed more bread for dipping in the sauce). We decided on the zeppoles for dessert. Being from Long Island, they are the closest to the real thing I've had down here so far. This place is a must go."}
{"text":"First time visiting this spot as we just moved into the neighbourhood. Or server was the manager and took the time to explain the history of the establishment, the weekly specials and drink menu. The wine pour is generous, and the wine list was way more extensive than expected! Our food was delicious, fresh, and the portion sizes were perfect. You could definitely split a large, or get two meals Out of it!(Our \"date\" was an early bird special at 4:00 so we got the small plates) They custom made my chicken parm without breading and it was super! The garlic knots were warm and fresh, and our server was extra cautious about my nut allergey! I couldn't resist the chocolate cake, so got a piece to go... it may not last long! We will definitely return, especially for their live music on a Wednesday or Saturday.  We were informed The owner actually plays in the band! In a town of corporations, it was lovely to find a local run establishment! Can't  wait to build many more memories here! Way to go highland creek! Basilico is a welcome addition to the community!"}
{"text":"Got there about 5:16 on Sunday afternoon.  Seated immediately.  Service was awesome. Ordered the bruschetta as a appetizer and it was wonderful. The chicken marsala was maybe the best thing I've ever tasted.  Cheesecake was wonderful. Just a wonderful dining experience.  

Update. Tried their new lunch place next door today. Wonderful pizza, great lunch deal, two slices of pizza and drink, under six dollars.  Nice folks running the place"}
