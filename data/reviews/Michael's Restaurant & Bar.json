{"text":"The food we ate deserves a solid 3-stars; it was exactly what we ordered, tasted as anticipated and was hot and fresh.  But, there is no gastronomic magic or surprise, because, well ... it's a diner.  A solid, reliable, archetypal diner. Food combined with service gets it four stars.  We chanced upon Michael's for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon; it was about 2:30 p.m.  Admittedly one of the driving factors in trying Michaels was the fact that they were advertising their Friday fish fry, and my partner is a real aficionado of battered & fried fish ... the fact that it was only $8.99 for AYCE was another motivator.  Now the fact that Michael's is in a shopping center with nothing but a lighted sign to indicate that it is at all different from the supermarket or hair salon that occupies the same flat building front does not build confidence at first.  And when you enter and see the flea market artwork of bright colorful kitschy landscapes, or the pastel vinyl booths, or the big screen TVs promoting keno, these may also give you a moment of insecurity.  We were seated right away by a no-nonsense woman in her mid-50s, with a with a non-specific Eastern European or perhaps Baltic accent.  We never did figure it out.  I thought initially that she was going to be a problem, because she didn't seem that friendly.  As I looked around I took note that only two other tables that were occupied at this hour.  We were about 30 minutes past the end of any lunch rush there might have been, and the place just seemed dead.  When the woman came back to our table, we had already made up our minds about getting the fish fry, but we had a few questions as well.  There were a number of potato choices one could have with the fish, including mashed, home fries, and french fries.  I asked for clarification about what the difference was between their home fries and french fries, and the woman began to explain how they make their home fries.  As she explained - the details are lost because I got the french fries - it became clear that she didn't just work there, but that the restaurant belonged to her family.  She knew how the food was made and she seemed to take pride in the fact that it was \"home made,\" and not from a can or mix.  She seemed to warm up a bit as we talked and she became rather matronly during the remainder of our meal.  A great example of this was their soup.  In addition to the AYCE fish, the meal came with the salad bar and soup as well.  There were two big tureens of soup at the end of the salad bar: cabbage & noodle and New England clam chowder.  My partner also loves clam chowder, so that was his first stop as soon as we had placed our order.  He had a salad plate in one hand and was about to set it down to fill the soup cup with the ladle, when the waitress/hostess lady appeared at his side and offered to do it for him.  He was going to take the filled cup from her, but she held him off while she set it on a saucer, because, she pointed out, it was very hot and she didn't want him to burn his hand. That's the sort of matronly attention I was referring to earlier.  Back to the soup ... he was quite impressed.  Again, this was not haute cuisine, but it was good clam chowder.  I have to take his word, because I don't eat shell fish, but he said it was a good balance of cream and clammyness, without too much potato and not excessively thick, like many packaged chowders tend to be.  I had the cabbage & noodle soup, and it was fine.  I think it could have used a touch more sweetness, but overall it tasted just dandy.  The salad bar had most of the usual salad fixings, but it also had a number of prepared salads to choose from: potato salad, cole slaw and macaroni salad.  There were also a few other items which I wouldn't have expected like spiced apple slices and cubes of bread pudding.  Personally, I didn't really care for the potato salad.  I found it bland.  The macaroni salad was uninspiring, but passable.  I quite liked the cole slaw, however; it went well with the fish.  As we sat down to start noshing on soup and salad, the afternoon crowd started to roll in.  4-5 more tables filled up while we were there, and the hostess/server seemed to know most of the people as regulars.  Our fish came out within about 10 minutes of our ordering.  It was hot and the fish was rather tasty.   The server continued to check back with us at regular intervals, but not too often so as to be obnoxious.  They fry the fish to order, so when we got seconds, the server asked us how many pieces we wanted and brought it out to us on a separate plate.  I really liked that I could ask for just two more pieces or six more pieces, so that I wouldn't wind up with more than I could eat and waste it.  All in all, we quite enjoyed Michael's; the food was good; the service was good and the price was good.  We live about 15 miles away from them, but I could definitely see going back on a Friday afternoon for more fish ... but not every week."}
{"text":"Love the salad bar and the menu items. Such a nice atmosphere with a friendly waitstaff. Love getting the grouponsto this place."}
{"text":"I found this place through amazon local and I consider myself lucky! Their Greek selection is wonderful, they even serve moussaka on the weekends. What a treat! It was very good. Their portions are nice and big. My mom and I tried grape leaves and greek meatballs as appetizers. The grape leaves were yummy and not at all bitter (like some others can be).  We shared a Greek salad, that really is a meal all in itself. I highly recommend this place.   The decor leaves something to be desired, but considering the food is so great and the prices are exceptional it's ok with me.  I went back for a second time and had the gyro platter. It was so tasty and enough for two lunches. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is completely different that it was several years ago.  A real chef and a bar have been added.  The food was really good, and plenty of it."}
{"text":"Tried Michael's today for the 1st time, going it I didn't expect much and it turns out I was pretty much on target. I looked at the salad bar and some of the lettuce looked a little past prime and there was a little fan plugged in sitting on top of one of the food items on the salad bar, so I definitely did not try it out. The Hubby ordered breakfast 2 eggs cooked the way he ordered toast ,sausage links and hash browns, he said the hash browns were kinda cold and a little tasteless other then that his meal was ok / good. I ordered the onion rings with a side of ranch, our server brought out ketchup while we waited for our food to arrive, but forgot my ranch, I ended up asking for my ranch 3 times before I got it. My onion rings reminded me of Burger King onion rings a little too greasy and kinda bland. Overall was not horrible but not really good either."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. We came for brunch.  I've had both the lox and crabcake Benedict and can say both are great!  Crabcake is house made and is on par with any I've had at bigger cities such as NYC.  Pancakes are house made and also delicious.  I cannot speak for lunch or dinner at this point...for breakfast/brunch you cannot go wrong giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Remodeling, but food is still great.  You get so much food for your money and the waitresses are nice and attentive.  Can't wait to see how it looks after the remodel!"}
{"text":"This place has good food, but the decor is lacking and looks ever more down at heel every time I go.  Stay away from the salad bar as the soup is usually cold.  The breakfasts are good and the fries are good.  Little iffy on the staff some days, but a good place to go with a friend if you want to talk and not be rushed."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast service is friendly and fast. Food is good and parking is close, Family owned and you feel welcome when you come in. New renovation looks good too!"}
{"text":"Michael's!  I grew up in Cleveland and we (my famiy) would always go there for brunch on Sundays and for dinner after swim practice etc.  An absolute gem of a diner. :) True to their name, you are received like family.   I now live out of state but always make a point to go there at least once every visit.  It never disappoints!  DELICIOUS homecooked food, GREAT service and true family feeling.  Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Delicious home made food with attention to detail. The homemade soups are amazing, as is everything else that I've had on the menu. The price point is perfect and you get a great value for your money. This place is under-rated and I recommend trying it out if you've never been there. It's not hip, but it's delicious - like going to your Grandma's house for a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"A trip home to Rocky River isn't complete without a trip to michaels for breakfast. Recently remodeled and owner is always there greeting guests, making sure you are well served, etc. Reasonably priced and really good food!"}
{"text":"Place was empty.  Kids running around like wild animals, bumped my chair several times.  Terrible experience on our 31 wedding anniversary.  Food was ok"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like Michael's as it's located within a short distance from our home.  Being family owned you expect that homestyle  atmosphere and hospitality.  While our waitress was very kind and attentive the rest of the experience was lacking.  The first wrinkle was that when we mentioned that we had a LivingSocial coupon the waitress then alerted us that we could only order from the main entree portion of the menu.  That's fine we both said and proceeded to order two seafood dinners.  Second and final wrinkle was the food, I consider myself a human garbage disposal and will eat just about anything, that being said the seafood was not fresh and was not good to the palate.  We left just as hungry as we were when we walked in the door.  Please shape up Michael's we really do want to like you."}
{"text":"Went to Michael's restaurant today and I must say it was delicious . The remodeling is really pretty and it makes the restaurant so comfortable . Our food was hot and there was plenty of it at a great price. Michael and his wife warmly welcomed everyone that came through the door . If you give this restaurant a try you will not be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Michaels is always good for a tasty, filling meal at a great price.  you can eat what your heart desires with the menu options they have there.  i'm up for breakfast any time of day and highly recommend the rinky dink omelette for those of you who want to knock satisfaction out of the park.  you'll be eating in a very relaxed environment, and bonus points for being a family business and rocky river landmark for the last few decades!"}
{"text":"Um, yes. Very much yes.  I don't need much from a diner. I need fairly decent service, great food, and a place to sit and eat in peace.  Service? Fairly decent. Even nice. They accommodated my request for something not exactly on the menu for Lorelei. The waitress was really nice about the fact that there was food all over the floor after we were done, although I felt bad about it and cleaned most of it up myself (and tipped extra).  Great food? Yes! I mean, it's not Lola or anything, but it hits the spot and the portions are GINORMOUS. I had the Rinky Dinky omelette (love the name), which is pretty much like the kitchen sink. It had what seemed to be 4 or 5 eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, swiss and american cheeses, onions, tomatoes, and peppers. Like the Shipwreck at Lucky's, only half the price and ... wait for it ... it tasted BETTER!  That's right. This omelette was probably the best I've had in Cleveland. I think it has to do with butter. Not oil, butter. Same goes for the home fries, which would have been perfect if only a little more well done (I like the crisp brown parts a lot, and there wasn't much of that). But still, plentiful, and delicious, mostly because of butter. Paula Deen would be proud.  What wasn't so great? It was speckled with old-guy man-dates. Not that I really have anything against crotchety old men, but this was a little too much of that. Guys loudly reading the menu to each other because the other guy can't see too well; another guy coughing for five minutes straight without covering his mouth ... etc. It was like that song \"Boom Box\" by the Lonely Island: \"Every day for lunch they eat BOOOILLED GOOOOOSE!\"  Anyway, I'm glad I tried Michael's, because the food filled me up and hit the spot, and they are kid-friendly. Also, parking's not a problem due to its location in strip-mall-land."}
{"text":"This was great,  will definitely be returning.  We wanted a salad bar, so yelp pointed us to Michael's. What a pleasant surprise. We ordered meals with salad bar. The salad bar was nice,  the soups were excellent.  The meals were amazing.  I had the baked scrod, so delicious!  Highly recommended for a nice family restaurant."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Michael's for years, so we decided to try it while in the area to check out the new Whole Foods location.  There were plenty of waitresses on staff, but we still had to wait about 20 minutes for our food.  I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs over easy.  There were more potatoes than corned beef in it, the eggs were runny, and one of my boyfriend's eggs even had a broken yolk.  Nothing special at all, so we probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped here after working out at Fitworks (cause that makes sense!?). Ordered the blt with fries. It was very good and the fries were probably the best part. I love ranch too, so if you're a ranch lover theirs is very good. Our waitress, Virginia, was a little incoherent though. My friend and I both asked for a side of ranch and Virginia brought us a cup to share. I was out of water for the first half of my food, and we never got asked how our food was. Doesn't mean I won't be back here though, the food was good."}
{"text":"The groupon can not be used at the same time as happy hour prices, regardless if you get regular priced meals w/ the groupon & hope to tack on the happy hour in addition.  The groupon did say, can not be combined w/ other offers, so my miss.  The groupon did not say that you could not use it w/ regular priced sandwiches.  Very much a \"Blue Light Special\" feel to the restaurant.  Great menu, great happy hour (if we could have used it), good food, if not a bit bland (however w/ the elderly's need for lower sodium, I can see that being necessary).  We got the cheese on fire, hummus, meatballs, grouper, and seafood pasta dinner.  Hummus was too thick, but good otherwise.  I would skip the meatballs, slightly dry and bland, cheese was great, very good quality seafood.  Enthusiastic waitress with good recommendations."}
{"text":"Greek omelet was good, portions large, prices good, coffee, service and atmosphere average."}
{"text":"How the heck do you rate a diner?  If you walk in with diner expectations - which is to say, a big menu, decent but not exceptional hot food, open turkey sandwiches and cheap eats, this is four stars.  If you are such a snobby foodie that hey, you can't appreciate anything unless it has balsamic vinaigrette and truffle shavings, then this is not going to be your cup of tea.    But if it's late at night or it's New Year's Eve and you have a yen for a roast beef sandwich, this is the place."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant.  It has good home cooking.  The prices are decent.  The staff and service is friendly.  The menu does has variety.."}
{"text":"Five stars for service and five stars for food. We'd never heard of this restaurant,  but found a  Groupon and decided to give them a try. SO happy we did. We will be back-- happy to make the 35 minute drive. I had the chicken fettuccine Alfredo, which came with a choice of soup or salad to start. Got a beautiful Greek salad. The chicken Alfredo pasta was some of the best I've ever had. For only $15, a nice salad and an entree is awesome! My dining partner got the Greek chicken platter, also accompanied by soup or salad. He had the soup, black bean that day. We started with the olive tapenade that came with warm pita. Yum!! Our total without the Groupon was $37. For a nice three course dinner for two people, I thought the price couldn't be beat! Love to support these local businesses. Our waitress told us Michael's has been in this same location for 30+ years. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love Michael's!  The service was friendly and fast and the food--consistently for years now--is wonderful!   Try the Mediterranean or the Grecian salads--they are massive and tasty.  I am also a fan of the dinners.  Where else can you get broiled tilapia, soup, salad and wine for less than $15.00?!  I have tried--it actually costs more to make it at home.  (and then you have to clean up)  The menu is huge and no matter what I have ordered, I have never been disappointed.   Worth noting is how long Michael's has been in the Cleveland community and how many years the restaurant has been giving free Thanksgiving dinners.  It is nice to have a place that has stood by the locals and been part of the neighborhood for as long as I can remember.  With so many businesses leaving Cleveland, thank you to Michael's for giving us great, fresh, food, nice service and a local hang out!"}
{"text":"Could not even rate the food.  Arrived at 6:15, and gave our name.  We were told that it would be about a 15 minute wait.  At 6:45, after two people who arrived after us were seated, a member of our party went up to the desk to ask when we would be seated.  Rudely, the answer was \"You'll have to wait\".  Believe me, I will never return here nor will anyone else who was in our party."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and value.  We have not been to Michaels for a few years. Wow, what an eye opener. New bar, live entertainment, updated menu (new chef?).  Saganaki, dolmathes, chicken souvlaki, all well prepared, generous, and delicious. Went to see the entertainment - now we will return for the cuisine."}
{"text":"Went here because we had a Groupon and it was our first time. Great food options, everything was delecious and the prices were extremely reseaosnable. We will be back:)"}
{"text":"First time customer that might become a regular! Food was great and the customer service was even better! Try the octopus, simply amazing!"}
{"text":"There is not just one Michael serving food in Cleveland. The Michael named Symon charges high prices and recently bought a $3 million dollar condo in NYC. The Michael who owns this restaurant has low prices and has served free Thanksgiving dinners for years to any one who comes. Who dines where says a lot about one's sense of social responsibility and self esteem.   Michael's Family Restaurant serves everything from corned beef hash in the morning to all you can eat fish fries on Fridays. Like your own mother's table or Michael Symon's for that matter, not everything is a blast of gastronomic delight. Yet many reviewers excuse any of Mom's or Mr. Symon's poor executions but scorn MFR for having bacon not cooked to personal taste. Geez what a world!  Once I had come specifically for the roast turkey dinner. I placed my order and the server instructed me to help myself to the soup and salad bar as she brought my iced tea. After I had eaten my soup and most of my salad the server came to my table and apologized saying there was no turkey left. I offered to pay for the drink and soup/salad bar but did not want anything else. She went to Michael who came to my table said he understood that often one is set on one thing. The drink and soup/salad were on him. Take more if I wanted.  Wonder no more why I go here often and so rarely to Symon's places that I probably contributed in total less than the cost of his condo's door knob.   I hope I am wrong and Symon does give a helping hand to his economically depressed hometown. Till I know, I will continue frequenting those who add to my town's well being."}
{"text":"Went after 3 pm yesterday.  The waitress gave us some attitude about trying to use a coupon, then mellowed out when we asked to order off of the dinner menu.  My wife and I both had the chicken souvlaki platter, giant serving with soup or salad included, both of us took half of the chicken home.  Clean with a nice location but could use some face lifting."}
{"text":"I just moved to town and was shopping at the stores nearby when we came across Michael's for lunch. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was quiet for lunch. My mother in law and father in law and my toddler were seated quickly for lunch. I ordered the Greek gyro, it came out with handmade French fries. It was delicious. You can tell it was made fresh. My in laws got the Greek salads with chicken. They received a big salad and they enjoyed it so much. The owner was very nice. She took the time to speak to us because we told her we're new to the area. Aside from the delicious food, the prices were extremely reasonable. I will 100% be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant to bring the kids along. I came in for a late dinner with my family, my cousin and her two young nieces, who are 6 and 7 years old. Our waitress was fantastic with the girls and was very nice to us all. The menu is pretty extensive with lots of Greek option. I wasn't all that impressed with the food but it was nice big portions and each dinner came with several side item choices.   The interior is current in remodeling stages so it's a bit different than I remembered from when I was a kid eating here.  Prices are reasonable - $10-$13 for entrees."}
{"text":"The Greek food here is the best Greek food in Cleveland. People always ask me, because of my Greek ancestry, where to go for a good Greek food. There are a number of places, but the food here on Saturday night - for Greek night - is the best I've ever had.  The talented chef that has been working here for sometime now is especially skilled in preparing Greek cuisine.  The good news though, is that the food they offer for Greek night is available the other nights of the week as well. I love it. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"My gf and I LOVE this place, I mean we're ordering 2-3x a week now. Great service, nicest servers/hosts, food is excellent. We get the bouillabaisse, kopanisti, and salmon dinners. You can't pass up their seafood I'm excited to try everything else, its just there are so many options."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. My wife and I dropped in for lunch because we were in the area. We'll definitely put it on our list of \"bests\"! Keftethesa appetizer was unbelievable and my wife loved the feta and olives. Our sandwiches, souvlaki and gyro were fantastic and generously sized. Good food reasonably priced is hard to come by so definitely try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't checked this place out sooner! Called in and spoke with a foreign sounding man who was pleasant in taking my order and did not mind at all my substitutions. I went with the Meatloaf dinner, homefries, gravy, coleslaw, mixed veggies, and a role for $11. Once there I decided to add on a piece of baklava for $4. Plenty of parking since the place is located in a plaza, and apparently the inside has been recently remodeled, only slight negative is that I did not receive a greeting when I walked in. No hello, no smile, barely an acknowledgment of my existence. This was a bit off putting, but nothing to completely condemn them for.  Back home I discover the shape of my meatloaf had that massed produced perfect look to it, but once I took a bite any doubts I had went out the window. The whole meal was tasty and made me feel like I was eating my family's comfort food (okay, not that great, but still satisfying). They did a pretty good job, even the coleslaw tasted fresh and was not drenched in dressing. Plus it was a good sized meal! I even had a little leftover to eat for breakfast the next morning. The baklava was a a nice portion, other places charge the same price for half the size! A bit too drenched in syrup, but a tasty dessert nonetheless.   I'd definitely check out more meals from this place, besides the comfort food options they have some Greek/Mediterranean dishes that have me curious to try! Plus excellent prices!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night because our first choice was busy...seated immediately, as the place was about half-full.  Our server got our drink order quickly, but things went downhill from there.  As the place got a little busier (still no more than 75% full), there was a delay in getting food from the kitchen.  The apps took almost 30 minutes to come out, and our meals came out about 15 minutes later.  As for the food, it was below average.  My margherita pizza would've been good, but the crust was not good at all.  The other members of my party were not satisfied, either.  Suffice it to say, this is a one-and-done experience."}
{"text":"Was in town for a Mass and thought I'd find a Greek place.  Shouldn't have come for breakfast. The entrees in menu sounded better!  My breakfast was just so-so.  Asked for crispy bacon and it wasn't.  Asked for butter and got whipped margarine. Maple syrup not real.  Just so-so.  Should've gone to Bob Evans.  The atmosphere very nice though."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant casual atmosphere homemade meals made from scratch very delicious. Enjoyed my meal the service and the desert had a nice time and will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a throw back to the 80,s.  The decor is old and the booths are worn.  But if u can get past the superficial u will find great service. Nice people and a well priced meal.  It's good food at a good price."}
{"text":"Pretty typical diner food with a Greek twist. I got some sort of Greek platter and my bf got the gyro platter. You definitely get a ton of food for what you pay for. My $10 meal included a salad and soup and the huge meal itself.  The decor is not particularly remarkable but the service was great. We used a Groupon to visit and we will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chicken souvlaki was amazing. Tender and delis. Mom had an omelet and enjoyed it. We will be going back to try out other menu items!0"}
{"text":"Great variety on the menu with weekend specials that will blow your socks off.  Salad bar was fresh, and soups tasted homemade.  Service was really fantastic, especially given we came during lunch rush and we think it was actually the family running the place.  It's a family joint with a family atmosphere old school.  The decor is a bit dark for me, but I'm not complaining because the food was good, portions fine, and price was fair.  Overall, a consistently good place that I would return too for a reliable meal.  It's been around a long time, and I can see why."}
{"text":"I live nearby and haven't been in for over 10 years. It was a shock to see how nice they have updated the place. Very cool to be able to get an adult beverage with your meal now too. Cathleen was our server... she was the kind of waitress one remembers from childhood. Very attentive and friendly (an old-school gem).   Our dinner group stuck with Greek dishes as the ownership is such. Wonderfully done and plentiful. One exception was an order of meatloaf (he's from Parma ;). I did try a taste and was not a fan, a bit too much bread in the mix and not much flavor. I would also suggest that they offer additional wines by the glass instead of just one brand. A wine list on the table would be helpful, as everything needed to be related verbally.  very nice experience, good value and would not hesitate on returning."}
{"text":"First time here. It's right next to whole foods. There's tons of parking. It was Sunday so they were busy! I got an omelet with everything it and my girlfriend got Eggs Benedict. Portions are huge, coffee is yummy and the atmosphere is casual. It looked recently redone. I'll be frequenting this place regularly for certain! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love diners and family restaurants like Michael's and George's, because the food is real good, and you get value (lower prices), compared to the over-priced and over-rated national chains!  I also know that I am supporting a local business instead of one headquartered in Oshkosh.  The owner, Michael (obviously), is usually there to greet you as well, and the servers are seasoned pros.  You simply cannot go wrong with a Greek diner or family restaurant, whether they be in Chicago, New York, Boston, or Cleveland!  I've been to many excellent ones over the years, and Michael's is no exception!"}
{"text":"I came here with a boyfriend a few weeks back after buying a deal on groupon. We came here on a Sunday evening for dinner and we're seated right away. There was some kind of huge birthday party or something going on, so the place was decently crowded.       Our Groupon stated that we could only choose from the dinner entrees menu, which of course were the priciest items on the menu. I think we probably would have still chosen the meals we did though. I had a Parmesan crusted chicken which was delicious! Everything about it was prefect and just what I wanted. Both of our meals also came with a delicious salad. My boyfriend tried to order probably 3 things that they were out of until he finally landed on one he could get. The waitress said they had a Greek night the previous evening and had sold out of a lot then.       We both enjoyed our meals. We checked in on yelp to get a free domestic beer, but were told when we went to pay that we couldn't choose the yelp and the Groupon deal."}
{"text":"So, after our visit to Michael s Family Restaurant, my 14mo old daughter came down with Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease. She gave it to my 3 year old, who in turn gave it to me. (I am 24 week pregnant.   I have narrowed it down to coming from this restaurant as we have been in the house for, and have gone nowhere other the n the grocery store in the week prior to her first symptoms, and she didn't go to the grocery store, I went by my self.  it is 3 to 5 days from contact for symptoms to appear, so there is no where else she could have got in in that time frame.   4 dr.'s appointment's 2 fevered kids, then spotty and itchy and cranky kids, 1 vomiting, and 1 already overworked pregnant mother.  We weren't super happy with out experience but would have gone back. Not anymore, I will never set foot in here again."}
{"text":"Now, I don't discriminate against restaurants just because they're housed in say, a suburban strip mall. I have had excellent experiences at such places in the past. But sadly, Michael's does not belong to that list. Maybe this time I should have gone ahead and judged them by the strip mall factor.  I do, however, tend to judge a breakfast place by their bacon and hashbrown/homefries/whatever type of potato they serve as a side. Because it is truly hard to mess up eggs, I look to the bacon and spuds. As with any breakfast place, including my kitchen, and my mom's and your mom's....the eggs were just fine. The bacon, though. Oh GAWD. Nastiest, rubberiest, most tasteless bacon ever. I really wonder where they found this stuff. The homefries were ok, but pretty sure they were just the frozen bag Ore-Ida kind that have nothing really going on there.  Some of the lunch items on the menu looked kinda tasty, but I won't be back to try them. Sorry Mikey."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night with my family and there was almost no one there. This off-put me a tad but we decided to stay. The waitress was very sweet but not very helpful. She didn't mention that a salad came with everything and I could have chosen a soup instead. As a person who's not a fan of feta cheese I dug around a lot to eat. The vinaigrette was tasteless but the herbs on top added the flavor.  The bread was bland and nothing memorable, although the texture on the inside was moist and warm.  I ordered the Mike's burger and wow it was huge. The flavor was off and the waitress never asked how I would like it done so it was in between a well done and a medium. What brought the rating up to three stars were the fries. OHMYGOD are they good. Flavorful, crispy, and huge portions. They were only a little greasy and the black pepper didn't overpower the other spices on it.  My father got the fish and pirogies and they were exceptionally greasy. I could see the pirogies across the table just glistening.  My mother got the salmon and while the outside was excellent and not fishy in flavor, the inside wasn't cooked. The waitress insisted that it was a medium but it looked raw to us.   I felt bad because the waitress was rather scatterbrained but exceptionally sweet. Overall, really disappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Michaels for quite a while and I'm so sorry I don't stop by more often. I dropped in for dinner last night and enjoyed an outstanding meal of fettuccine puttanesca served with an awesome Greek salad.  In addition, my friend had the stuffed cabbage senior special which was also very delicious.  His lentil soup was perfect. The new decor, excellent service, and delicious food at  ridiculously reasonable prices should not be missed!!!"}
{"text":"Michael's, I'd like to preface this by saying I'm so sorry I ever doubted you. I've walked past you on so many occasions, without even sparing you a glance. When I did notice you, I was discouraged by your bland exterior, and didn't think of you again until today.   Lured in by 7% cash back and a free beer, my wife and I walked into Michael's. Frightened by a restaurant populated (sparsely) only by much older people, and an expansive, sprawling menu, we almost walked right back out.   I am so glad we didn't. The food we had tonight was out of this world good. I'm from a fairly foodie area, San Francisco's Bay Area, and I could not critique one aspect of what we ate. We started out with saganaki  -  kasseri cheese flambeed tableside -  and were overwhelmed with \"side\" Greek salads comparable to pricey entree salads from other restaurants. My wife got blue-crab stuffed tiger shrimp over mushroom risotto, and I got the gyro platter. The servings were enormous, while maintaining high quality. I have no idea why this restaurant was so empty, but it shouldn't be. We walked out full, happy, clutching overflowing to go boxes and furiously messaging relatives to find excuses to go back.   Go to Michaels. One of the best examples of not judging a book by its cover that I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Typical diner, but open on January 1!  Whaddya want in a diner? How about a Reuben sandwich? Fries? A salad bar? Check, check and check. Michael's doesn't put on any airs -- it's a diner through and through. It's not worth going out of your way for, or even choosing over Max's when Max's is open, but Max's is closed on New Year's Day. So there you go."}
{"text":"The salad bar is very good, the soup is home made and great, and Chef Dino's creations are just superb!  I can't rave enough about Dino's Greek creations and the quality of the kitchen's work.  You are getting a near Michelin rated dinner for 1/4 of the price.  The service is swift, courteous and effective.  The owner, Michael, always has a kind word to say.  These are good people running  a good restaurant.  You will not regret a meal at Michaels, and it may well be the best you have had in months!  4 stars because it is time for a bit of a facelift on the interior.  Michael says it \"is in the works\"  Can't wait to see the coming tweaks."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! This was absolutely wonderful!  Just happened to see it when in the area.  This place is going to be on our list of best places to go for outstanding food, service and atmosphere.  You won't be disappointed!   We enjoyed the feta with olives, souvlaki,  Gyro and Keftethes meatballs. We can't say enough about how delicious everything was and we have plenty of leftovers for dinner! Ann P. Is a wonderful waitress, going above and beyond!   Thank you,  The Stanton's"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with a girlfriend.  We had the grilled Octopus for appetizer.  It was out of this world delicious!  I had the seared scallops for an entree.  The meal was perfection!  Sauce on the side was light and creamy with hints of fruit.  Topped with crunchy zucchini sticks.  Something you would expect at a high end restaurant.   Price was too low in my option!  Our server was extremely polite and attentive.  I am taking the family back there for sure.  Lots of menu options!"}
{"text":"Saturday - Noon. Wisely went here before grocery shopping. To be fair, my review is only based on a very simple, standard two-egg/meat/potatoes breakfast. If you can screw that up (and many places can, oh yes) then I probably won't be back. I wasn't very hungry, so just got that so I'd - I mean my wallet - would be a bit safer as I walked through the valley of the Shadow of Whole Foods.   Service was very good, prompt and balanced - by that I mean the waitress gave me privacy but didn't ignore me. I hate when wait staff is overly bothersome just as much as when they are negligent. I should say that the place was relatively deserted, so it's hard to judge what service might be like during a busier time. I will find out though, because after taking a look at the menu choices, I have every intention to go back, especially for the fish fry.   My eggs were cooked to order. You might think, \"Eggs, so what? but if you've ever had a snotty over-easy egg or received an over-medium that was frisbee hard, you know. One thing I did think to share - my bacon had obviously been baked and retrieved from a pan somewhere. It was stiff as a board. I like crispy, almost over-done bacon - well okay, I like bacon of most any kind, so this was fine with me but some people wouldn't like it.The order came with potatoes, which I hadn't seen on the menu. I rarely eat them now but had a few bites for the sake of Yelp readers (see the sacrifices I make?). The potatoes were nothing to write home about, but they weren't bad. They seemed to have varied flavors... seasonings I presumed picked up from other foods cooked on the same flat top.   I want to add too that the Yelp reviewer who said something about getting hand-foot-mouth disease was just rude to post that to a public review site such as this. HFM is a virus that spreads easily through coughing and sneezing. It can also spread by contact with infected eh... well, I'll say diaper contents to keep it polite. Now I suppose that doesn't rule out getting it at this or any other restaurant, but given that the child mentioned is 14 months old, it seems more likely that it could have been something gotten through another route. At any rate to indicate that there's very little possibility of it being contracted anywhere else than this restaurant is not only rude but potential defamation. If it's a true concern, that's a matter for the health department to investigate.   Carry on, Yelpers."}
{"text":"I need to preface this by saying that while in high school, I smoked countless cigarettes and drank just as many cups of coffee in Michael's.  After high school spent a comparable amount of time soaking up whatever intoxicants I had poured into my body that night with some kind burger or all day breakfast.   These fond memories add up to a bonus star.    With that out of the way, read on:  By all measures Michael's is a solid three stars.    The food is good, not great.   The service is good, not great.  However, Michael's has been a Rocky River landmark for as long as I can remember, and in that time, I have never had a bad experience, just none that were exceptional.  Truthfully, I think that's what places like Michael's are supposed to be.  It's reliably good, and always there in a pinch, and to maintain that consistently for several decades is really an accomplishment.  The prices are actually fairly good, and the last time we were there, breakfast was served in something like five minutes.    For me, Michael's in like home (except my bathroom is probably a little cleaner)."}
{"text":"We have been here for breakfast a few times and it was pretty decent but our dinner experience however was not as good. We ordered the greek meatballs as an appetizer and they were pretty good. I ordered the chicken milense and my boyfriend ordered the crab stuff tiger shrimp for entrees. My chicken was marinated in a really sweet balsamic vinegar dressing and then breaded. The chicken was really dry and the roasted potatoes it was served with lacked any kind of flavor. My boyfriend said his shrimp was ok but the crab it was stuffed with wasn't really good. The worst part of this visit was the weight. I understand they were busy for lent on a Friday but we were there for a good hour and a half after we were seated. It took probably 45-50 just to get our food after we ordered. We will still come back here for breakfast and maybe dinner but will be staying away from Friday nights."}
{"text":"One of the best fish fries that I have had.  It is all you can eat but the pieces they give you are huge!  I have not had any of the other things on the menu but if you are looking for a great fish fry, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Family style home cooked meals. Very friendly. I've been going here since I was a kid. They always treat me right!"}
{"text":"I've ate here a bunch of times. The breakfast is great and available all day. I've noticed the prices have increased since they remodeled the dining area. The dinners are big portions and come with soups/salad and side dishes. Lots of Greek options. There's a bar towards the back of the dining area (where the salad bar used to be). It's a multi generational family restaurant. Kids to the elderly and everywhere in between will find something to eat here."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner. I had purchased a Groupon and talked with our waiter about which items we could use the Groupon on. They only allow it on select dinner entrees- which is kind of disappointing. I had previously been to Michael's a few years ago. It's changed quite a bit. Our dinners came out. Very concerning that part of the food was warm and the other part was cold. I have no idea how this is possible but needless to say I'm not happy. The food has a taste that I can't describe. It just did not taste right. We each had a side vegetable which consisted of one piece of broccoli. For $35 dinner I will not be back. I love to support local businesses rather than chains but not this one."}
{"text":"I purchased a Restaurant. Com certificate for Michael's. The place is currently being updated but even the construction crew was accommodating,  opening the door and apologizing for the dust.  Nothing that interfered with the dining room. The service was excellent. Kathleen was a dear.  Rarely one says this, the food is under priced! Surf and turf with THREE SIDES for $14.00!??   One of the best Greek salads I have ever had and THE BEST tzatziki sauce I have ever had. You could dip a tire in this stuff and it would be delicious. The souvlaki platter was delicious. I was so full from the soup, salad, and apps that I groaned when my entree was served. I ate every piece of meat on the skewer!   Definitely worth the trip and way more than worth the money. Give this little gem a try!"}
{"text":"What a great family restaurant!  I had  perfect whole grain blueberry pancakes and eggs.  Trust me, it is almost impossible to find tasty whole grain pancakes, but they perfected it here.  Hubby ordered a french toast plate and raved about it as well.  Prices were great and server was attentive. Not a fancy place by any means. I kind of got the 1970s feel from the decor, but aren't most family restaurants? You may have to try a chair or two that it comfortable as it looks like they have seen some mileage."}
