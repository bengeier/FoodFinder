{"text":"We had a group of 10 in our party with no problems getting seated on a Friday at 7pm. Service was excellent and everyone's food was awesome. I had the fish platter wife had the chixadilly sandwich - incredible. All the pasta dishes that I tried were delicious too. Highly recommend and the prices were probably too low but I won't compl"}
{"text":"We are here very frequently and there has not been anything we have had that we didn't like.  Grilled chicken salad, pizza, parmesean crusted chicken, you name it, it is always good.  The servers are very down to earth, friendly, and efficient."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is in need of a makeover.  Decor is dated and drab.   Food is boring and bland.  It's lost its luster...the little it had.  Organ player is still nice to hear....but that's about it.  Will drive the extra mile for something better."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area a month ago. This is quickly become a favorite! We started with the stuffed hot peppers for an appetizer. There were two large, delicious sausage stuffed hot peppers covered in marinara sauce and topped with mozzarella and provolone. Delicious! For my entree, I chose the stuffed pork chops. And they didn't disappoint.  My companion chose the eggplant Parmesan.  It is a lovely little place. Very clean. Great ambiance."}
