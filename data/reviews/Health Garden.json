{"text":"Looks like the owner of this store OLEG I is mad at my review.....next time have better service and bad review won't be left dummy. And please when leaving a private message please learn to speak proper English!  Below is his message he personally went out of his way to send me and OLEG I happened to leave his own personal review of his own store! 

What the heck you doing, you pathetic excuse for a human being, going from spa to spa giving every business you walk into nasty 1* reviews, hiding under anonymous reviewer bs while trying to make yourself more pretty. Guess what, you aren't pretty, you are pathetic, both inside and out. You walk into into businesses where your type doesn't even belong and do same. No wander nobody pays any attention to you, you are hiding from the world and that's exactly why you don't have any followers and friends. Visit a psych doctor instead, but don't forget to leave him a bad review as well.

Now would you want to shop here?!  sounds like a racist as well by referring to me as \"Your type\". Funny thing he's never seen how I look as the day I was there no males where in the store...oh well his his lost. LMAO"}
{"text":"Came to this store just to look around and once I walked in, there were 2 ladies who were talking and did not acknowledge I came in. Very rude customer service. Only 1 other customer was in the store compared to Ambrosia next door."}
{"text":"Stopped by for my bi-yearly  vitamin stock  up. Lots of assortment of products and knowledgeable staff. I have everything I need!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to health store, until others closer to my home opened up. This is a great health store for supplements. Most of the staff are well-informed and can make appropriate suggestions. All homeopathic medicine can be ordered her if it is not available in store. Due to the size of the store, some items are slightly higher in price compared to Ambrosia next door. All staff speak Russian as well."}
{"text":"Expensive and no selection. Plus staff isn't very knowledgeable about products sold there. Natures emporium has way more selection"}
