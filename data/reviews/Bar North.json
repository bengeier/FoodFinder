{"text":"Love this place. The burger with the Robiola Cheese is outstanding. But why change the menu so often? This pisses off regulars who come in expecting something they have been craving all week. Not cool Bar North. Not cool at all."}
{"text":"This place is so fun and casual! I love stopping in for lunch when I'm shopping at Kierland. Even my grandma liked it (she's picky, okay?).

We tried the burger and the roasted eggplant pizza. Both were very good, the ingredients seemed fresh and high quality.

They have a great pizza and wine deal going on right now, it sounds like my next date night!"}
{"text":"Service was good, we had a lot of questions and our server was very pleasant and patient. Food was good, nothing over the top amazing, but not bad either. The whole lunch was meh, although the price was right (happy hour prices all day Sunday!). One sidenote that seriously was distracting-- they have a fly problem, which always grosses me out and makes everything seem ultra dirty! We noted it to our server and he just said they come in from the open doors. I sure do hope so!"}
{"text":"Wanted to post and give 'em five stars because as I considered who to review . . . I thought of my fav places and this is definitely one of them.  The food I always like, usually from the happy hour menu.  Meatballs, arangini . . .it's all good.  The wine selections have been just fine for me and the service always has that touch of personality and exceptional-ness which I so appreciate about the Sam Fox Group.  The ambiance is great with either a patio seat overlooking the fountains at Kierland . . . or the inside chic little dining room with tv and light, contemporary decor.  But the big reason I wanted to review them and give a deserved five star rating is that I am always a happy camper there.  However happy I am going in, it is augmented  there. :)"}
{"text":"Walked in to their neighboring restaurant, and got seated here, same menu and kitchen - so that suited us just fine. Kale salad was delicious, split it with my companion, wished I had one all to myself! The chicken pesto was a huge portion, and hit the spot. The kitchen service was a little slow, but our server was a gem and brought us some bread for the wait."}
{"text":"I love the spaghetti and meatballs, the only reason I come here. Seriously, the service just sucks. I've been waiting for about 15 mins for someone to acknowledge that I am done eating. I don't mind not getting any quality checks during a lunch period but I'm done eating and I want to leave."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Small portions. I would rather eat at chipoltle down the street. Beet salad was okay but not worth the 14 dollars. Server was very nice (was a guy)"}
{"text":"Great buzz and great Happy Hour. Ask for Mathew.   He will show you everything.  Cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"Came here for an alumni event.. I'd say the space is a little cramped for any type of social event/gathering, but the area was nice enough to stop by for after work drinks. And the kale salad was unbelievably good. I think I had 4 helpings!"}
{"text":"Not used to giving 5 stars but we are two for two in phx. Our new fav is North Bar great service, out door seating and the food fabu. Also took advantage of 1/2 off bottle wine prices great selection. Go for the short ribs gnocchi  tasty to last lick of the bowl. Did have to ask for bread -kind of a miss"}
{"text":"Great place, wine is cheap for happy hour and I can spend hours here working on my novels and people watch. Food is good."}
{"text":"Charming place to have happy hour. We went on a weeknight-- the outdoor seating was completely full so we sat at the bar inside.

Food:
We had the cheese and meat board with some surprises, including nuts, pickled sweet peppers and apricot preserves. 

We also got mussels-- $12 for the serving size is a pretty good deal. The toasted bread it came with is good for dipping into the sauce.

By the time we got to the bruschetta we were so full (you read that correctly, we didn't order any entrees)! The generous amount of prosciutto on it was delicious and it went well with the melted cheese.

Service:
Our server working the bar looked like Michael Fassbender and was as proper as I think Mr. Fassbender would be as a bartender. Prompt and proper but approachable. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to NoRTH and Bar NoRTH many times, but this time was just totally disappointing.  Just to put things in perspective, we were there for a late lunch (after 2pm) on a Friday.  We walked in and they told us to take any seat.  Then we waited over 10 minutes before anyone came with menus.  It wasn't as if they didn't see us walk in.  We ordered a salad and a pizza, and we were splitting both.  The salad came and they had already split it for us - nice touch.  Then we waited 40 minutes for the pizza.  Crazy.  Of course, the waiter came right away with the bill, but then never showed up to take my credit card.  We walked up to the bar to pay on our way out.  I'm not sure if I'll be real anxious about giving them another try - if they can't handle the meals when it's empty, what'll it be like when it's busy?!?"}
{"text":"After taking the kids to the spash pad at kierland my wifes friend suggested we go to north for food and drinks.  We asked for patio seating which shouldn't have been a big deal since they had a couple of tables open up.  The hostess went to have them cleared the disappeared to flirt with thr bar tender after a while a server came over to ask if we'd been helped we told him we were waiting to be seated he then found out that all the patio had been filled while we were standing there with hungry kids.  I told them forget it we'll go some where else. The hostess talked yhe girls into staying with free apitissers and seating on the restaurant patio.  She then disappeared again, my wife's friend happened to know server who then came and sat us.  At this point I'm pretty sure everyone working there was stoned.  We ordered apps and drinks then ordered pizza.  I would like to say the food was good but they forgot to put our pizza in.  Tgey finally brought thr pizza out about the time we were ready to walk out, and they didn't comp the apps which is the only reason we stayed.  I will never go there again. If it let me I would give it zero stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful wine, very friendly service and cool atmosphere. They also played great music which I always enjoy. The soup was delicious and the bruschetta was fresh and very flavorful. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little lunch place in Kierland.  I had a mixed greens salad with chopped dates, nice touch.  I need to try several more dishes to make a more accurate review.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The food quality is great.  When I want a good meal I frequently order the salmon with spinach.  They are always will change the veggies for me.  I prefer a low carb greens.  I like the consistency of the food.  I know I will always get a good meal."}
{"text":"Looking for a casual spot to have a great glass of wine and a terrific meal?  Then look no further than Bar North.

Oh sure- you can go to the fancier North restaurant next door, but why?  The menus are the same, you have the same great choices of wine and the stellar service abounds.  So with our group the other night- we took over the bar side of this restaurant in Kierland Commons and they took great care of us!

Chris, our server, was outstanding!  My glass was never empty- he took the time to make us feel so welcome and he was quick with a quip (which I love!)  And imagine my surprise when I found out he had only been with Bar North for about two months . . .I would have thought, given his comfort with his role, that he had been there much longer!  But who cares?:  He really took our night from just another night out to a great night out and for that he deserves a shout out!

We started with some chacuterie and bread along with some type of stacked sandwiches.  For our entrees we had a couple of their thin crust pizzas as well as two of their signature pasta dishes.  All were quite good.  And for dessert? Tiramasu which almost had us licking the jar it came in.

Bar North is located in the Kierland Commons mall so parking is plentiful.  I also liked that it opens onto to a common patio which would be great for people watching on a warmer day (it was cold when we were there).  And the decor is contemporary and understated with candles twinkling in the windows only to be matched by the crystals dangling from the exposed bulbs in the center of the room.

All in all a really great choice for a fun dinner out!"}
{"text":"Bomb dot com. Everything we ate was delicious! This was our first stop after checking in at the hotel and it was a GREAT choice! Meatball appetizers...delicious. Calamari....delicious. Chicken parm and roasted chicken....delicious. Brussels Sprouts were to die for and I don't even eat them. Gluten free options for my girl too. Happy hour cocktails $4 and worth it. And for dessert the chocolate tart.....friggin delicious again. Our waiter Frank was the bomb dot com too. A great welcome for this Los Angelino to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful birthday lunch here. Service was outstanding and he food was delicious & reasonably priced. I had the chicken Gorgonzola salad and my husband had the burger - both we're generous portion sizes and really yummy!  We recently moved to the area and are serious foodies - this place will be a regular spot for us... Love the ambiance and could easily accommodate our young kids, too :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go.  Great food, drinks and atmosphere. The restaurant seems like it might be a snotty Scottsdale Bar, but it is very down to earth with out the \"Scottsdale\" prices."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service. Everything you can expect from a Fox Restaurant Concept. Aaron and Amy were exceptional. They made our much deserved day date a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"When the weather is nice, I love the patio a Bar North. But it's Summer in Phoenix so that means A/C is a must. 

Same great menu as North just more casual dining focused around the indoor bar and outdoor patio space."}
{"text":"Love this neat little place! I ordered the zucchini chips and a margherita pizza off the happy hour menu. YUM!  Also ordered the sangria with was delicious!  I sat on the patio and the atmosphere is nice.  It was like I was in a \"mini\" Central Park.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Those of us \"foodies\" know that if the company is not good, the food is not good...regardless...which is why I am happy to give Bar North such a great review.  I was there with a terrific group of people [STAR 1].  We were able to relax on the patio (with clean furniture, I might add) overlooking the fountains, in an intimate setting where we could hear one another [STAR 2].  The wine list was good, at a fair (i.e., expected) price [STAR 3].  The appetizers and salads were awesome [STAR 4].  And the waitstaff (Damn, I wish I could remember her name!) was incredible [STAR 5].  'nough said."}
{"text":"Excellent.  I have been 5 times and tried many different things on the menu.  Everything has been consistently good and fresh.  I truly don't understand people complaining about portion sizes. Every item has been flavorful and CORRECT portion sizes.  If you want  a 40 oz steak move to Texas. If you want delicious, healthy and beautifully presented, try Bar North. Service was outstanding and friendly."}
{"text":"Great server. Menu options were underwhelming. Pasta was well prepared, and wine was cheap for the area."}
{"text":"Dear Bar North, 

Please use WD-40 on your entrance doors. The squeak is painful. 

With love,
A yelper."}
{"text":"Ripoff Report - Proceed with caution!

A group of us came here for happy hour last night to celebrate a coworker's departure. Our office is located in Kierland, so we chose Bar North as it's within walking distance, they have a nice patio, and have provided great service in the past. The service was friendly and very accommodating to our large group, but we left feeling bamboozled! 

Four of us in the group ordered a pitcher of Sangria. We were about 3/4ths of the way through the first pitcher, when another pitcher had been served to our table. None of us had wanted another pitcher, but started to drink it anyway as we all thought that someone else at the table had ordered a second one. There were about 12 people at our table so, it was hard to know who ordered what. We all asked each other \"who ordered the second pitcher?\" The answer was no one ordered the second pitcher, the server just served us a second one without asking, and added it to our tab. We felt that we couldn't dispute the check since we started to drink out of the second pitcher, even though we barely touched it as we all had to drive ourselves home that night.

To make matters worse, one of the woman in our group had ordered a glass of Chardonnay not knowing that there were several options on the menu. Instead of asking her which one she would like, they served her the most expensive one at $14 for one glass. If you have several different kinds of Chardonnay, why wouldn't they ask the patron which one they wanted? Instead they just took this as an opportunity to up-sell.

There are several options in Kierland for Happy Hour without shady service, that is where we'll be going next time as Bar North left us all with a feeling of being taken advantage of."}
{"text":"Enjoying our browsing at Kierland Commons we stumbled into Bar North and took a seat on the patio's cozy chairs.  Our waiter promptly greeted us and started us with drinks.  My margarita was refreshing.  The star of our night was the delicious cheese board.  A variety of colorful treats included  asparagus, French bread, cheeses, huge olives and a spectacular jam.  My out of state family was impressed.  So was I and I will be back with my husband, visitors and business associates."}
{"text":"I have always preferred this place to the \"big NoRTH\" across the way from it. Bar North is open, airy and comfortable and not too noisy, even sitting pseudo inside (even the \"inside\" is pretty much outdoors when the weather is nice). The menu is the same at both places and BN is less pretentious while still being a nice place to be. It is just so relaxing! The food is good to boot! 
Last weekend we stopped in on a \"girls night\" for wine and apps. We all loved the calamari salad (it sounds just like regular  calamari on the menu, but comes with delicious lemon tossed greens It's a superb combo of light n heavy combined). We also had a pepperoni mushroom pizza that was baked to perfection. They used button mushrooms and I loved that! I even picked them off the pieces we didn't eat because I couldnt leave them behind! The only Thing we weren't crazy about was the asparagus bruchetta. The prosciutto was delish, but the bread and the cheese just didn't work for any of us who tried it. Still, we had a great time, excellent service and some good food and wine. I give them five stars for that!"}
{"text":"I met some ladies for happy hour and we had most of the things on their happy hour menu. We were parked right in the middle of the bar and it was So loud. The food was not out of this world and he wine was awful but not the worst I have ever had. 
I don't know I guess if I try it again I will stay away from the carb loaded happy hour menu.  I was not impressed. That bread soaked in oil and mascarpone cheese was disgusting. 
The margherita pizza was fine.
Unfortunately for this place Postino's is right across the street and kills their meat and olive board. 
It was ok, I will eventually try again but not in a hurry.  Good location and service was fine."}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended this place while I was visiting Scottsdale.  It did not disappoint.  Service was attentive, happy hour options were delicious and the wine was great!  Terrific vibe and great indoor and outdoor seating options.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax and grab a drink at Kierland Commons.  This place gets busy and I can understand why...it is just a cool place!  The prosecco cocktails are good and they have a nice beer/wine selection too.  I am convinced that anything Fox opens will be a major success...this guy just gets it!"}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in North Scottsdale...Great place to just chill and enjoy the great wine list."}
{"text":"The reason I give this a 3 star is because of the service. The food is delicious but the service was bad. We walked in, and seated ourselves. The waiters would walk around but it took them forever to come ask us for our beverages. After our drinks came out he left the table and took alteast 25-30 mins to come back and ask us for our order. He would walk around in the place and notice that we had our menus down and ready to order but took forever to come back."}
{"text":"Such a great place to have happy hour with friends.  I love when you can have happy hour anywhere in the restaurant; you aren't limited to the bar area.  I ordered the Hef to drink.  Not a good one.  I ordered the sangria for the next round.  I enjoyed that far more.  To eat I had the kale salad.  It was quite interesting. It was both savory and sweet.  I didn't eat all of the little cubes of cheese because it would have been a tad bit too salty and heavy.  I had a slice of my friends pizza and it was delicious."}
{"text":"The excitement of looking forward to the weekend has now passed, having taken along with it your money, brain cells, and a formerly dent-free ride. 
Nothing left to do now but laundry and commiserate about the coming five days at work.
Wrong.
Just like Sir Edmund Hillary making his final push up Mt. Everest, you dig deep for that one last party push. It's in you, grind it out.

Somewhat subdued from a weekend of shots and the spasmodic activities following those shots, I opt for a mellow night out. 
Bar North is the place.

For twenty bucks, you can get a decent bottle of house red and any one of a half dozen appetizer plates. We had the antipasto, followed by a thin crust pizza. 
Another twenty bucks got us a second bottle and a small bowl of spaghetti and meatballs.
A third bottle would have left its mark the next morning. We called it good for this particular weekend. (Even with the dent).

Bar North on a Sunday night is a good way to forget there's a weeks worth of shit headed your way in less than 12 hours. 
Some like to call it work."}
{"text":"Very disappointing . Stopped in for happy hour , only 3 items on menu , 4 if you count chips , I do not consider chips a happy hour item . Drinks were ok but pizza was overcooked , therefore hard and dry and tasteless.Next time we are going somewhere else , there are plenty of other restaurants with better happy hours ."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have like my own personal set of bookshelves in Barnes & Noble, but I ventured outside onto the main area of Kierland Commons to have a drink.  Usually, we would stop at Zinc, but noticed Bar North right across the \"street\" from B&N.  It was a typical lovely October day in Scottsdale, so we wanted to sit outside.  Wow.  Will definitely go back over and over again.  Great location, our server, Andrew, was fantastic, as were the other wait staff that came over to make sure we were taken care of.  Hadn't really planned on eating, but the menu, while not extensive, was very intriguing.  We ordered the \"Chef's Board\", which is their version of a charcuterie platter, and the bruschetta.  Wow.  Did I say that already?  First of all, I love charcuterie.  This one was one of the best I've ever had.  The combination of meat, cheese, peppers, nuts and chutney was a palate sensation.  The bruschetta was a bit different than I'm used to, as it included grilled asparagus.  Not being a huge asparagus fan, I removed them, and the remainder of the bruschetta was absolutely delicious.  My wife, who is a big asparagus fan, ate it and raved about it.  Highly recommend this nice little eatery."}
{"text":"TastyLocated in Kierland Commons we have come here a few times. Their food is always fresh and tasty....especially the burgers. Last time we came for lunch, my husband had to take a work call and disappeared for +10 minutes...the waitress was awesome and noticed and she kept his soup warm, until he returned..she went above and beyond for sure!! Thanks:)

Great selection of wine, beer and drinks. 

I recommend for starters the grilled cauliflower, soup or meatballs. If your contemplating grilled chicken sandwich over burger - get the burger.  The chopped chicken salad is also delicious."}
{"text":"Great experience overall. Service was fantastic, attentive, nonintrusive, knowledgeable. Atmosphere, fantastic, more lively inside, more mellow outside, we chose outside and loved it. Food, AMAZING. Very well priced, and extremely carefully crafted and perfectly executed. The mussels, some of the best i've ever had, flavorful, not overpowered by a ton of spices, tender, large portion. They took the chorizo out for me as i am a vegetarian and it was flawless. Then i had the cheese tortellini, except it's so much more than just that, it's a delicious, delicate pasta dish, with fresh peas and other goodies and a great light sauce, greatly assembled. Husband had Shortrib, very pick about this dish, love it too. Dessert, we almost fought over it. Great spot."}
{"text":"Casual place in Kierland to kick back and grab a drink and light bite.  I had the thin crust margherita pizza and it was pretty good.  The patio is fun when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"After all of these years it's nice to see that the integrity of the food is still the same - really, really great! And Danielle was the best server! Very sweet, exceptionally polite, gave great recommendations; she really made our evening enjoyable. What I will say is that the general manager Jonas (I think was his name) has to be one of the rudest, most obnoxious general managers I have seen. Not only did he ignore two tables requests for a heat lamp to be turned on when it was 52 degrees outside but the manner in which he spoke to our server was appalling. He clearly is in the wrong industry and has a lot to learn about customer service and management. Would love to see this guy learn a thing or two and change his tune. Would make for a more enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super fun little spot with creative foods at a reasonable price. Get the barradas appetizer with a nice wine for starters"}
{"text":"Solid/Excellent food. Amazing all day Sunday Happy Hour. A little less stuffy feel compared to the 'Kitchen' side of North."}
{"text":"This was stop number 2 on my little Kierland Commons adventure. I was in awe of how beautiful the strip was. The perfectly landscaped streets, soft string lighting - it is truly stunning. 

Bar North had an inviting feel to their decor. Their wrap around patio felt cozy with red-cushioned couches and chairs - I immediately felt drawn to this area so we decided to stop here for a drink. 

Our server came out to greet us in a timely manner. He was kind, knowledgable and checked on us regularly throughout our stay. I ordered a margarita which was awesome! It was made with just the right amount of sweetness. Myself and my company were enthralled in each other's company and the cozy patio that we decided to stay for a snack. We ordered the Chef's Board which was a beautiful display of meats, cheeses, peppers, nuts, asparagus, bread, olives and a magnificent jam. We left not a crumb for a mouse. Well done, Bar North!!! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 starts to this place, I would. How could you not love the bottle of wine plus a bruschetta or pizza for $20.00 every Wednesday for happy hour and all day on Sunday??? My girlfriends and I always end up with at least 3 bottles! The food is so delicious!! addicting!! and even though the bruschettas look little, they will fill you up. We always end up with leftovers... maybe we get full too quickly with that wine and all the talking LOL. Highly recommended for a date, get together with friends, etc. Especially when the weather is gorgeous and you can sit outside. =) I wish it could be closer to my home. Enjoy your Vino Tinto my grapefriends!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here, and love eating outdoors on the patio when the weather allows.  Service is always great as is the food...the salads and pastas are wonderful."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Black Friday with a large group. The two best things about this experience were #1, the large wide table that they sat us all together at where we could see and talk to everyone at the table. It was amazing! (there were 10 of us). The second best thing was the salad I ordered.  It was their Seasonal Vegetable Salad and I added grilled salmon to it. OMG, it was fantastic!  Listen to what they put in it...butternut squash, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, radicchio, pecorino, farro, pistachio, date, white balsamic vinaigrette.  Sounds overwhelming, huh?  And with the salmon too?  Well let me tell you, it was fantastic. Each vegetable cut nice and small so that every bite had a little of everything in it.  All super fresh and absolutely delicious!  Yep, that experience was worth 5 stars IMHO."}
{"text":"I am in town from LA and wanted to grab a quick bite near my hotel. Found this spot on yelp, must say I had a fabulous experience. The bartender Brian was friendly, genuine and knowledgeable. Being Italian and from RI where we have great Italian food, I was skeptical ordering the meatballs and the bruschetta. But, I was blown away by both. Def check out this spot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Excusing the pretentious capitalization of this restaurant, I must say my meal was perfect. Went with family, had the salmon. Cooked to perfection and was accompanied by some sort of risotto like pasta with crack cocaine butter on it. I plowed the whole thing down like there was no tomorrow. And that was after their delicious house bread and special butter. Good stuff, this place."}
{"text":"I started with the grilled artichoke. It was good and actually filling, as it was meant to be shared.

The beer selection proved limited, with craft brews not on draft but in bottles and cans.

The bar is more a place for groups, as the dynamics for interaction that give a bar a welcoming atmosphere were missing.

Eat well, tip well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great service. Great vibe. Only compliant was the cauliflower appetizer was nothing but broccoli. Posed a bit of a conundrum for us. Other than that food was great."}
{"text":"I passed this restaurant many times but for some reasons I  never went. Came here for dinner recently with big group and we sat outside at the patio and the weather was perfect. 

We had couple pitchers of red sangria to share, it was very refreshing. I had black mussels, it was excellent. Our waiter was very nice, he was a bit funny as well.

Loved the pot herbs garden around the patio, what a great idea and yet pretty and lush to filter the dry and dusty air of Arizona.
............................................................
The only thing that weird and negative about this restaurant was when I made a reservation to be seated at the patio the girl told me that she couldn't guarantee, What!!!

Other than that overall was a good experience, good food and good service."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with a colleague on a Thursday while in town on business and I am pretty sure we were the only two there not trying to pick up or be picked up - and the crowd was primarily 40+. Decent but somewhat limited wine selection. During happy hour you order red or white and don't know what you are going to get. No draft beer - only a handful of options in bottles and cans. Service was quite good. Had the mussels appetizer and they were just ok. \"The Pig\" pizza was excellent. Solid choice but not spectacular."}
{"text":"Food was good. The service was great. I waited for a shuttle to pick me up after my meal to take me back to resort and it took forever. The waitress who was clearly busy kept checking on me and brought me out a drink while I was waiting. Very thoughtful."}
{"text":"Great little spot in Phoenix. I was in town for a business trip and a few of us decided to go here for a quick bite. Great food, great service, friendly staff, and good location by the convention center."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch after a movie on Memorial Day - the place was buzzing with excitement and people.  We had a great appetizer, bruschetta and a nice glass of wine however when our entrée arrived the music stopped.  We both ordered \"Spicy Shrimp Pasta\" and it took quite a while to arrive but we were not in a hurry at all.  The meal itself was not pleasing to the eye - The first bite was the last bite.  The flavor was along the lines of canned spaghetti - aka no flavor.  I thought I ordered \"SPICY\" - and to top it all off the shrimp were overcooked & tough.  The staff was very nice, offered to replace our meals, removed the entrees from our tab but at that time we were pretty much done.  If you are dropping by for an appetizer I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Truth is \"my new favorite spot\" in Scottsdale. I mean it's kind of difficult not to like a place with great food and a fun atmosphere. The outdoor seating area overlooks the courtyard area at Kierland. 

I think \"Bar North\" gets a little overlooked. It's like playing Annie, Annie over. You've got North (the restaurant), kitchen in the middle and Bar North on the other side. Menu is exactly the same at either place. Just a more casual, comfortable environment at Bar North. It's also quieter and there are lots of cozy seating options if you just want to stop for a cocktail. I have to say I prefer \"Bar North\" over the restaurant \"North\".  

If you make a visit try their chitarra pasta dish. It's served with grilled butternut squash, brussel sprouts and hazelnuts. Served with a light butter cream sauce. I know kind of an odd combo but one of the \"best\" pasta dishes I've ever had. 

They do \"special requests\" too. My husband always asks for their chicken lasagna. Not the typical lasagna version your thinking of but it's been one of North's specialties and no longer listed on the menu. If you're hungry for pizza try their prosciutto fig goat cheese pizza. Another \"unique\" winner.

I LOVE this place and can't wait to go back. Bar North next time I'm in town I'm a coming."}
{"text":"I like the patio but its just too small, however my friends and I always end up there. The location is easy to get into."}
{"text":"We've been going here since we moved into the area. Actually, we haven't been in a while... must come here soon! 

The service has always been great, even if it takes a while to come out. They are always busy, but the food is great. It tastes like it was just made as well, not premade and then reheated for service. That's why we can justify any wait in food. I wouldn't say it's a long wait, but it's not quick.

We've never actually been to the restaurant side. We love to sit out on the patio on Sunday, get their Happy Hour (all day Sunday) items and kick back. We bring friends and family here when they visit and they all enjoy it. Gotta be our favorite brunch place, as long as we can get the lounge seating outside!"}
{"text":"In terms of food, the place was fabulous! Unfortunately, it took years of uncomfortable frustration to receive any food.

I came to Bar North during lunch hour on a weekday with a reservation. The reservation was made for North, but I guess it was too crowded so we were seated in the bar. It a really nice day out and the set up was wonderful! We told our server and hostess from the start we were on a time crunch and needed to get our food as soon as possible and ordered the moment we sat down.

We got the fried calamari to share, I got the Seasonal Vegetable Salad, my sister got an Heirloom Beet Salad, and my friend got the Caprese Sandwhich. 

The fried calamari was delicious, but an awkward appetizer. It was sort of a salad? Its a good thing the three of us are close friends/sisters or else it could have been awkward.

We were so hungry waiting for our food we asked for bread. The floor was not busy and there were several waiters walking around. We stopped two of them and asked for bread, but it took at least 10 minutes to come out AFTER watching the same two people we asked bring bread out to at least 4 other parties before us. It felt rude.

Finally, after waiting for our food for forever, my friend had to leave because her lunch break was ending. We asked for her sandwich to be packed to go since it had still not come out yet. My sister and I received our salads, and it was really awkward because she had still not gotten her food despite making it a point she was in a rush and asking for it to be boxed up because of the slow service. Finally, it arrive.

One of the waitresses was super clueless and came by after knowing my friend had left and refilled her water glass... what? So weird.

We finally got our check and left. The food was good, I hope I can go back and have a better experience, but the service was just odd."}
{"text":"Came to Bar North with a big group that took up the whole place for a business dinner.  Bar North did a great job of providing excellent food to such a large group all at the same time.  Service was very friendly and wine glasses were kept filled all night.  I'm not sure of Bar North's actual menu, since we were provided with specific menu with a few options for each course.  Those dishes are listed on North Italia's restaurant menu, which they are apart of.  Perhaps they are only normally available in the North Italia's restaurant, I have no idea.

Started off with table shared appetizers of zucchini chips, braised meatballs & garlic toast, and bruschetta.   The zucchini chips were sliced razor thin and fried like a potato chip, these were a great improvement on the normal fried zucchini - 5 stars.  The braised meatballs were fairly light and came with a garlic toast to mop up some of the good red sauce - 4 stars.  The star of the show was the bruschetta.  It was covered with prosciutto de parma, crescenza cheese, grilled asparagus, truffle oil, and grans padano.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of this stuff, and it's a reason to come back for sure - 5 stars.

Next was an interesting caesar salad, that while didn't look like anything too different, had a slight hint of spice to it.  Chili oil mixed with the dressing perhaps?  Whatever it was it worked nicely.  4 stars

For my main course, I chose the Strozzapreti.  This is a fresh made pasta (as is all of their pasta) chicken, roasted mushroom, spinach, toasted pine nut, in a parmesan cream sauce.  I swear I tasted truffle oil again, in this dish.  It was excellent, although the chicken was a little over cooked un fortunately.  Perhaps that had something to do with serving so many of us at one time and keeping the food hot.  But even so, I'd give this 4.5 stars.  

I got to sample both desserts offered.  And it was a debate around the table as to which one was best.  They were both excellent and there wasn't a clear winner.  The Salted Caramel Budino was a rich and creamy pudding, topped with creme fresh and sea salt.  Knowing I wouldn't be able to get more than a bite or two away from my wife, I dug into my unusual Tiramisu.  This was also served as more of a custard/pudding in a cup.  The small pieces of Kahlua soaked ladyfingers, were more of a complement to the rich mascarpone mousse, rather than over powering the whole dessert, like some versions do.  The big hit however was a simple dark chocolate covered rice crispy like crunchy topping.  The crunch really added something to the dessert.  In fact I threw a few of those on top of the Salted Caramel Budino, and it was winner as well.  5 stars.

I had no idea that Bar North/ North Italia is a chain.  Well a small chain anyway.  9 locations.  But 1 of those locations is near me in Irvine, CA, so I'm definitely going to hit that place up soon."}
{"text":"I stoped in on a Wednesday early evening. They were not too crowded so I was seated immediately. I started off with the holy hour red wine and the prosciutto bread which was amazing!!! It was the perfect amount of salty and cheesy!  
I had the chicken pen for dinner, the chicken itself was good, the gravy on top was nothing to write home about... but the pasta that came with it was AMAZING. The place was super clean and the waitress was super friendly. 
I finished off with their Carmel dessert which was on point!!!"}
{"text":"This place looks great, has a good atmosphere and I had wanted to try it until I caught a glimpse of their poor customer service and condescending vibe.

My girlfriend and I wanted to grab a quick drink before we grabbed dinner at a nearby restaurant. We walked up to Bar North, went in through the open and enviting front door and waited at the entrance for a few moments. No one offered to seat us, direct us, or help us so we thought maybe that it was open seating, afterall they had tons of open seats on the back patio. We approached a table began to sit when finally we were approached by someone who worked there and appeared to be management stating that we couldn't sit at any of the open tables on the back patio because of the specific weekend and its NOT open seating. He then told us that we would have to walk all the way to the restaurant (the next occupancy over) and ask the hostess to be seated at the same open tables we were trying to sit at. He spoke to us as if everyone should know this and escorted us out of Bar North and pointed to the front of the restaurant North which is a decent walk away. The way we were escorted out of Bar North made both of us feel like we had been caught stealing...

Why couldnt he just have seated us himself, told the hostess that he just sat us and atleast pretended like he wanted to help us?...

Didn't bother to wait to be reseated by hostess..

Won't be going back.."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place for happy hour, as the food was delicious, the service was exemplary, and the atmosphere was relaxed! We had two bottles of wine and two appetizers and walked away totally satisfied! I am sure the rest of the menu is just as good, as it was packed when we left!"}
{"text":"I went here the night before my birthday with my family to try something new.  They had been there a few times and were adamant that I should try it.  I can see why they love it, the food is delicious and the portions are generous.  My spaghetti and meatballs were flavored spot on.  The noodles are hollow, which adds to the flavor, that was a new one for me.  They give you 4 meatballs, too much for me, I gave two to my Dad.  My parents loved their salad and margherita pizza.  They gave me a free dessert for my birthday to take with us, since we were so full.  The only thing not to like was waiting about 45 minutes when we were hungry, but I will say it was worth it."}
{"text":"This place is nice to sit outside and socialize as well as inside to enjoy a meal. We sat outside and our waiter was great no was patient because we were taking a while o order as well as wine to food selection. I especially loved my pesto pasta dish - was amazing ! 
Definitely worth trying out !"}
{"text":"Awesome meatball sandwich! Group ordered pizza's and salads...everything delicious and service great!"}
{"text":"My work family enjoys coming to Bar North for our occasional large group outings (basically just important lunches or happy hours). It's quite nice to have a private area just for us to use. The decor makes it cozy and welcoming.

And their staff... simply amazing and always on-point. Normally our food and beverages are pre-selected for a menu so it never is complicated in what to pick. Their wine and beverage selection always pairs well with the menu too! Get a charcuterie board and you will not go wrong, either as a board or as the chefs make bites on top of the bread. Had both, can't pick one or the other.

Worth every cent spent here, I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We stopped in to have a light lunch on a day spent in Scottsdale. Our waiter provides excellent service and we had some delicious appetizers. The meatballs, the brushchetta and the calamari which were all three excellent! I would definitely come back the next time I am in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Second visit and again the food was awesome!  The reason for the 4 star rating is they seem to have an issue with flies in the restaurant.  They were buzzing around our table and the neighboring tables all meal long.  A pain and disappointing for such a good restaurant.  Back to the food, if you like calamari there's is the best I can remember."}
{"text":"Mediterranean Muscles combined with the Bolognese for dinner made for a wonderful evening meal. The service was exceptional, if you delicious, and the prices reasonable. 

All in all a great place for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to Bar North/North Italian kitchen a couple of times with friends, but this time made me write a review. Who knew that they have an all-day Sunday happy hour with a bottle of house wine and choice of pizza, (yum!), bruschetta (double yum!) or chef's board (can I get a triple yum??). That plus a bowl of thin-sliced zucchini chips will make your night! Just sit on the lovely patio, drink a glass or two, and enjoy life (and don't even think about work the next day). Well, now I'm hungry for more of those zucchini chips..."}
{"text":"When it comes to Italian food I am very very picky, but theirs place hits the spot. The squid ink is my absolute favorite and the tortilini. I go here once a week on my lunch break and always have great customer service. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Quite simply a perfect spot to grab a drink- anytime.   We stopped in to grab some mimosas mid-morning while in town on vacation. The bartender was very friendly and accommodating.  

We didn't grab food this go 'round- but I know that it is very good if I had to compare it to the NoRTH in Austin.  

The atmosphere is very inviting with open windows and (extra *) PURSE HOOKS!  :)"}
