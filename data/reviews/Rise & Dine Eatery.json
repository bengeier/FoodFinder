{"text":"I chose this place as others on Yelp said it was a good place to get breakfast.  As a bonus, it was really close to the Ontario Science Museum, where we wanted to go that day.  What a great place to start the day with some good breakfast.  I think our family ordered a bunch of stuff like pancake, poutine, eggs, sausage and bacon etc.  The usual stuff and it all came out the way it should.  Everything tasted fine and that's what you want sometimes.. just your normal run of the mill breakfast.  Nothing crazy or all crazy stuff that some people try to hard to make it \"special\".  They do have their specials if you want too.  The people there are really nice and friendly.  We were traveling and they made us feel welcomed in their restaurant.  Good luck to our waitress, I think her name was Sandy.  It was her first day and we think she did a great job!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast-for-lunch the other day.  The waitress was really lovely and very helpful (SO friendly).  I ended up getting the classic with bacon & sausage (which the waitress was kind enough to split between the two for me) and it was delicious.  The homefries were quite yummy - and I'm a bit picky on that - and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  And it was only $8.50.  In terms of value for your buck, this place is great.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Always a great time. Friendly service, great food and a chill atmosphere. Come get your bunch on for sure"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Good selection of omelets, waffles, etc., plus the regular breakfast staples.  Excellent coffee. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is such a welcome change for the area. Such a great location and nobody has found any success there... Until NOW!  The guys running this place have made an incredible transformation here. It's a fun, sleek and cool place. That menu, whoever designed it, is a genius! So many wonderful things, I will be here enjoying many of these different items.  From crepes to waffles and peameal bacon to chicken sausages, these guys know breakfast and their lunch selection is incredibly priced.  All those ridiculous chain places offer a cookie cutter breakfast and lunch, time to go diner style again and take care of the people of this city. I'm so tired of getting ripped off with other places, you know the names. I have to order two breakfasts to eat there and pay more than a dinner out.  All I can say is, this place is wonderful. It goes back to the \"bang for a buck\" days. Something society, in general, could learn from. Thanks for not being a franchise, thanks for not gouging and thank you for providing quality products.  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"We have now been there for lunch and breakfast.  What a great addition to the area.  The food is great,  service is even better.  Eggs Benedict is the best around town.  Make sure you bring your appetite.  This will be a frequent stop for us.   May sure you try it and spread the word.  These people deserve to be very successful"}
{"text":"Everything it should be.   Great service.   Deep menu.  Very fast.   Good value.    I would like them to add fresh OJ.     It's quickly become a regular choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"The customer service and food here is 10/10! We came here with a big group and all we can say is wow! The service was fast, attentive and efficient. The menu has a variety of choices from breakfast to lunch options. I tried the Bad Boy Burger which was so juicy and delicious! Their onion rings are amazing too. We also tried their waffles, one of the best I've ever tried. The price point is also very reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food. I can't wait to come back and try the items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Really nice place for breakfast. Staff are friendly...place is clean and portions are generous. Great breakfast place!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my parents (they are regulars) this afternoon and was very satisfied with the food and excellent service.  They both had waffles with fruit on top and I -- a guy that likes to live life on the edge -- decided to be audacious and try something exotic; so I ordered a hamburger with fries.  All patties are made fresh (as opposed to premade/frozen patties).  The burger was juicy with a nice, light, crispy char on top.  The fries seemed as though they were cooked a little longer than usual; which I actually liked, as they were soft, but had pleasant crisp to them.    Our meals were literally in front of us within 5 minutes of ordering.  We were in and out of the restaurant in no more than 15 or 20 minutes.  If you want a quick, freshly made meal, I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Would definitely come back for breakfast and recommend Rise & Dine to those looking for a new breakfast spot. Food was delicious and service was great! There is free parking at the side and it is easy to access through public transit."}
{"text":"Visited this wonderful place on 6 occasions and waited to do this review.  They consistantly have fast, friendly and helpful service.  Seems the same servers are here and that says so much.  they are experts at breakfast and are prepared for the rush.  This means the food comes quickly and looks amazing even if the dining room is full.  6 visits.  6 delicious and awesome breakfasts with amazing service!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, and super delicious breakfast. We had the early breakfast special and the Montreal bene. The potatoes were absolutely perfect crunchy and tasty. The server, she was really great. Definitely going back for another breakfast, or maybe lunch..."}
{"text":"This building has been so many restaurants in the past and they all come and go. But I really hope this one is here to stay! The breakfast is out of this world! The price is really good, the staff are amazing and friendly and the food is great! Awesome place for a nice morning out with the family or friends. I'm really glad there is a new breakfast joint in the area. Defiantly going to make this a regular spot now!"}
{"text":"My sister and I just had breakfast at rise and dine. There are so many great options! I had the Zeus which was delicious. My sister ordered the Philly breakfast which she also loved. We also ordered a pumpkin spice waffle. We were too full to eat it and took it too go. It too looks amazing. The servers were very nice and friendly and kept our coffees full. I would easily recommend this place to anyone! Just great!"}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with this neighbourhood at all; I came here purely based on the reviews. True to its stars, this breakfast restaurant offered a pleasantly satisfying experience and I will definitely come back here again.  A few co-workers and I came here for opening. We were delightfully greeted by a smiling waitress who gave us her full attention. She was knowledgeable with the menu and we had no problems with our orders. Our orders came out impressively prompt, with no lack in taste or quality. The portions are generous, most dishes usually came with 3 eggs - which is, in my opinion, the most satisfying sight for the start of your day! And omg, that steak is a beautiful sight too, not to mention yummy! I'll be honest, the steak & egg pictures are the reason why I chose this place over others xD and not bad for the price! One thing worth mentioning too is their home fries: they're good! Even when it got cold! It's got a lot of \"substance\" to it, if you know what I mean. They weren't dry or powdery. There was potato to every bite. Their coffee and tea are refillable; our waitress was quite punctual with the coffee rounds. Each table is fully equipped with your necessary condiments.   The newly renovated space is family-friendly, I love their comfortable booths, it's clean and spacious. I wonder how busy this place gets later on in the day? Overall, I couldn't be happier with this breakfast date of ours. Location is a bit out of the way.. But if whenever there's an opportunity for a breakfast date, this place will for sure be at the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Very happy to have this place open up.  The corner of St Clair and O'Connor seems to be cursed. We saw a pizza place closed down (great food), a chinese/Japanese close shop after 1/2 year...we were really hoping for a new restaurant in this area for lunch varieties.  So far we have been doing takeouts so i can't comment on intetior and services but it seems to be fairly busy....and the food is delicious Large portion...your typical comfort food with breakfast option all day (right now they only open till 3pm to test the water). It's cute that they named their items after movie stars and there's so many options of pancakes and waffles that I couldn't wait to try.   Today I had their daily special pork souvlaki in a pita with French fries. The pita was a bit crispy and the pork chunks were moist with the right about if tsiziku sauce, red onions and feta cheese. The French fries were a little bit on the soft side... they were not salty but it's probably better for your health anyways.   Co-worker had pumpkin pancake- no comments from her but she finished everything.   We hope this place will stay open. We will definitely come back to support this local business!"}
{"text":"The service was really nice and the good came out super fast. Everything was delicious and filling! I got a Combo Omelette with bacon and my hubby got a Meat masters omelette with a side of pancakes. Hungry? Nice breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"$5.99 Early Bird Breakfast Special baby! Got there right when they opened and got to meet Tom, the owner. Specials come with 3 eggs, 2 slices of buttered toast, home fries and bacon OR sausage OR ham (coffee not included). Hubby thought the sausages were salty and I thought they were a little dry. The bacon was smoky with edges slightly crisp: this is how my son likes it, I prefer it more crispy. Eggs were cooked perfectly, home fries were better this time around. Gotta add extra points for having orange marmalade for the toast. Coffee is Colombian, very mild. Tom was a doll, attentive and sociable and even wrapped up my leftovers himself. Decent breakfast for the price.  Tom recommends their burgers, will be back to try them out. 3.5 rating bumped up to 4 for excellent service, I guess I got the wrong server last time."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast Thursday morning with my bf, food was really good we both got the Canadian Benny. Our sever Maria was amazing, she was very attentive and friendly :) will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"Finally happy to have found a yummy brunch place close to home!   Not lots of parking available in the lot but the restaurant itself was very spacious and clean! The staff are very accommodating and diligent to ensure your coffee cup is never empty.  We both ordered bennys (one with peameal bacon and the other with smoked salmon) was able to substitute potatoes for fruit. Prices were very reasonable and love that it is close to home. A lot of variety available- excited to try other dishes off the menu next visit.  Food was fresh and served to us in reasonable time. Definitely on our list now of regular places to eat!"}
{"text":"Amazing from start to finish!! Even the coffee was delicious! We had the porky poutine, the pulled pork eggs Benedict and a Belgian waffle. All were exceptionally good and the service was great."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the second time we had breakfast here and it was again wonderful. I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings before 9 am and the staff were not phased. I have to say that my 'breakfast' was just what I wanted."}
{"text":"Very happy to see this place open. We came for breakfast on a Saturday morning. Fantastic prices, huge portions, and great tasting food! My \"Megas\" Eggs Benedict with spinach and feta was incredible. The 3 eggs were perfectly poached and the Hollandaise sauce wasn't too rich. The waffles and crepes were both excellent. Lots of fruit and fresh whipped cream.  It wasn't very busy when we got there at 9 am, but it was getting busier by the time we left. This location is cursed for restaurants. We have seen so many places come and go. I really hope this one stays longer than all the others."}
{"text":"This place is great.  If you want a simple bacon and eggs breakfast, you can get it. If you want some crazy waffles, they have lots of choice. The menu is large like many diner type places, but it's not crazy or out of control.  While not a large place, they had no problem seating our group of ten. One of our group had some dietary restrictions and they easily handled the special requests.  The staff and owners were all great and we had our breakfast in no time on a busy Saturday morning."}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot. Been a few times, lots of options. Homefries were on point, crispy."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast/Lunch spot   This location has seen it's turn over.  Nothing ever stuck, but Rise and Dine is hopefully here to stay.   Literally have zero complaints.  I live close by and eat in and get take out often.  The wait time is 10 mins tops on takeout and dining in has always been pleasant.  The staff are awesome & the food is awesome!   Pesonal faves,  The DiNero AND The Balboa  Also the Polish poutine.   My daughter (8 yrs), also loves the food.    Only suggestion I have, to get some SRIACHA SAUCE   But that's a personal preference.    All and all 9.99*/10  *Nothings perfect"}
{"text":"Breakfast is generous and prepared as one anticipates. Service is excellent, friendly but not too familiar. Coffee is decent. And at 8:30am there was plenty of parking. Food is served rapidly. Lovely place for an honest breakfast."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite breakfast places. All of us love the food here and we all have different things that we like to have. Some of us like the steak and eggs and others are eggs benny fans. I am a traditionalist, with bacon, eggs and pancakes. Of all of these things I would say only the pancakes are weak. Everything else was fantastic.  The servers, which can make or break a restaurant, are all friendly and remember our orders from visit to visit. They are efficient and the food is ready quickly. It is also consistent - which is another hallmark of a good restaurant. The only issue is parking if you drive. It has a small parking lot, which fills quickly, so best to get there without a car, or if you drive - park somewhere else and do a quick walk there. There are many other places to park in the area. There is a good sized lot across St. Clair Ave. and pubic parking around the corner. Would highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch - weekends are a bit crazy, but they do take out, and weekdays are are good bet for a quick in and out."}
{"text":"Great tasting breakfast/brunch and generous portions. At our table we had poached eggs and back bacon, smoked salmon eggs benedict and pancakes. All the dishes were high quality. Good hot coffee. Yum! I hope this diner stays for longer than the other well-meaning establishments that have come and gone in this location. Plenty of free parking!"}
{"text":"What can I say other than YAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSS!  Always great service. ALWAYS great food. I never have a complaint when I come here. Le boyfriend and I are in the area as much anymore thus we haven't come around that often, however I ALWAYS recommend this establishment to anyone who is in the area.   Food Options.  You have your regular breakfast options, eggs / bread / home fries. Then you have ALL the omelettes to choose from. You feel like waffles?! They have a page full. Perhaps sandwiches. Its ALL THERE. PLEASE whoever is reading this just go there for yourself and try it =)"}
{"text":"Rise & Dine great food.  Outside does not look like much, but you walk in the door and wow. It is like two different worlds. Food was great, prices good and the service was amazing. Give it a try you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Sweet people and good standard brekky food. I would love to check out their waffles and poutine the next time I'm in the area. The selection looks awesome.  I just grabbed standard eggs and sausage. The chicken sausage was a bit dry so I probably wouldn't order that again. But the tatertots were dope!  Unlimited coffee... Get on it."}
{"text":"Great value for money! They have a very extensive menu with ao many delicious breakfast options from eggs, to bennies to waffles and pancakes and burgers and other lunch options."}
{"text":"A good place for a bite to eat.  I stopped in around 1:30 and found  a good few tables filled.  I ordered the hamburger with the home fries. It was a large burger - appeared to be home made (my preference), fresh bun, and all the trimmings. Very tasty. My only disappointment was the coffee. It was hot, just not rich and tasty. Odd for a place that touts breakfasts. Another patron came in shortly after me and took a table close by. They ordered from the breakfast menu and it looked delicious - a must try for my next visit. The waitress was prompt and knew her stuff ."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! We went for lunch with 8 people and 7 of us ordered different burgers. The home made burger patties were so juicy, delicious and fresh. I had the Bad Boy Burger which is a burger topped with beef brisket, sauteed onions and Swiss cheese. The bun is soft and melt in your mouth. I love burgers and have pretty much tried every top rated burger in the city and let me tell you for $10.99 this burger tops the list. I had the home fries with it which were delicious but some of my co workers had the onion rings and OMG amazing! Some of the best onion rings and they come with this mesquite BBQ sauce for dipping... a must try! We also had to try the waffles as there were so many different kinds. We got the Reese Pieces waffle and the Apple Compote, graham cracker, chocolate, cream cheese icing one and they were out of this world. My favorite was the Reese's Pieces... all I can say is OMG! Forgot to take pics of everything as we ate to fast :( Definitely adding this place to our weekly lunch spot.  Also, have to mention our server Marie was fantastic. We were in and out in 45 mins. Super fast and attentive server. Someone even asked for something not on the menu and she was down to make it for him.   Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices. Very good menu, big portions, wait staff excellent at keeping your coffee topped up, fast wifi, and good parking. Atmosphere is very pleasant, and very clean, highly recommended for all occasions."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese burger. It was tasteless and had the thinnest piece of cheese on the meat. It was just aweful."}
