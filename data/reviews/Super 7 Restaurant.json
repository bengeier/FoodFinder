{"text":"MMm... Super Sever is A-OK.   Nothing really special about this place and it is definitely not packed like other pho places, which may speak a little about the quality of their offerings.   Its sparse patronage is definitely not because people just don't know about how good this place is.  I had a small special pho (or whatever their smallest size was).  It was fine.  The broth wasn't as flavourful as I would have liked.  The quantity of meat in it was ok.  The meal did come with a sweet lemonade (lemon drink) which is a bonus.  The bean sprouts came steamed rather than crispy fresh.  I don't mind that.  It's probably because of salmonella scares that they're no longer served raw.  The basil is fresh though!  Even with the plentiful free parking, you might still have hunt for parking as it is located in the same plaza as T&T supermarket."}
{"text":"I haven't tried many different dishes there so I don't want to say it's super duper just because I like their pho. Personally, I must say they are great because they are at a convenient location. Secondly, their pho is better than the one from 88 Pho at Alton Towers, which is probably the next closest pho restaurant. At Super 7, the beef is not over cooked, ripped in bits and pieces (like scraps), and rough in texture. Thumbs up! I will be back to try other things later. For now, durian milkshake and regular pho is great!  PS: Service here is not even horrible, so shame on anyone who doesn't pay tip at all. I say it's a rule of thumb to at least pay 10% for service that is mediocre. Don't know since when people started to think that it's okay to not tip for the service they received."}
