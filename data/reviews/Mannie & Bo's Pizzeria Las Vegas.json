{"text":"They told me to try a cream cheese, pineapple and sausage Calzone. I was of the mind that cream cheese has no place on a pizza -- ever. But I tried it and I'm glad I did. The cheese melts, mingles with the tomato sauce and creates something magical.

Also, this place makes everything from scratch -- dough, sauce, sausage and meatballs. They even bake their own bread for the sandwiches.

They do NY Style, and really good deep dish.

Manny & Bo's takes a little longer, but it's well, well worth it."}

{"text":"I found Manny & Bo's for lunch with a friend that was raving about this place.  I was truly shocked at how much awesome you can fit into such great value.  You can get a slice of pizza, a drink, and a salad for FIVE BUCKS!  I mean how often can five bucks get you anything anymore and yet still be enjoyable?  This place had great pizza slices that were just what you want in a walk and enjoyable place, I highly recommend getting the salad and it comes with a great serving of cheese bread.  I will return to this place again and maybe even call ahead for takeout on one of my cheat diet days."}
