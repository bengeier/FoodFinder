{"text":"Hands down best Mac and cheese I've ever had (and I've had a lot of Mac and cheese over the years). Can't wait to try other items from the menu!"}
{"text":"Staff were super nice, but the food is not good. Super overpriced, and misses the mark completely by trying too hard to be interesting."}
{"text":"Maybe they are new but the menu is confusing and the taste is mediocre. Staff was wonderful. Maybe after a little practice it will be great."}
{"text":"I've only had the soft-serve, which was great, but nothing especially unique. Our cones were decked out to the point where you need a plate to catch all the goodies that fall, and there was no line when I went unlike other more centrally located frozen treat stops. Richer and sweeter than Sweet Jesus, though still it's just soft serve with a ton of toppings - take the option of having the center of the cone injected with fudge! Very friendly staff, and on top of that they were patient and kept hidden any frustration with the sticky mess everyone was leaving. I'd go back to try some of their other treats and savory snacks for sure."}
{"text":"Late night eaters rejoice! Junked has opened to take care of all of your post 1-3am cravings for food. I would like to re-assure you that this is not just \"drunk food\" because it tastes great sober, unlike so many places that seem like a great idea when you can barely stand.

The post-bar eats in the Dundas and Dovercourt area have been meagre to say the least. Until recently you had the choice of Lakeview (overpriced and generally gross) or 7-11 (no point in explaining). That's just sad. Junked however, offers a tasty and surprisingly healthy alternative to those options. While this is by no means a health food establishment, the ingredients are delicious, fresh and it's real food, if you discount things like Doritos.

I have only been here once but will be back soon and on my first visit had the Original Junkie; oven-roasted chicken, avocado, bacon, mixed greens, tomato and light sage mayo, $8 and the Pulled Pork Smash Bag; Doritos covered in Pulled Pork, Junk Slaw and house made Jolly Rancher BBQ Sauce, $8. Both were delicious. The Smash bag was kind of like eating a really fresh pulled pork taco but the shell was made out of Dorito and the waffle was an open faced sandwich basically. The waffle was more savoury than sweet and all of the toppings were fresh and looked beautiful. It was really just plain fantastic.

So, if you happen to be craving good late night, fast food in the Dovercourt/Dundas area, walk over to the North-East corner and look for a small, unassuming, blue and orange storefront right beside the 7-11. You will not regret your decision."}
{"text":"I love ice cream.
I think S'mores Oreo Soft serve is the best ice cream for me."}
{"text":"I had one of their famous smash bag and their poutine tots with pulled pork and I was thourghly impress with it - they say it's junked food, I say no way! This is a pretty good meal, that's tasted pretty healthy to me, and I know cause I'm a health freak! It was super fresh... And the poutine, their gravy was delicious and it wasn't fatty tasting at all. It's a must go again #showmemorejunk"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've eaten here on numerous occasions, and I don't know how they do it, but it feels like clean, not so greasy junk food.  

The smash salad, for starters, is the taco salad of your dreams.  They even take the time to line up all the toppings on top of the lettuce in neat rows, with a diagonal drizzle of sour cream on top.  

The waffle sandwiches are good too.  I've had both the classic and the pulled pork, and they are really good.  

Do you like deep dish pizza?  And do you like mac 'n cheese?  If so, then try their deep dish pizza with mac cheese inside the pizza.  It's a revelation.  I saw Jesus in my block of velveta cheese afterwards.  

The best thing, the thing I go back for, is the dessert cup.  They make them fresh to order each time, and the guys who work there will ask you about your likes and dislikes to make a custom one.  Generally, you get buttercream icing, some kind of cake/cookie/cereal or whatever, and then some kind of drizzle.  It's the bomb.  I hate myself when I finish it in one sitting.

Also, Frozen Donuts.  That is all.  FROZEN DONUTS.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE???  

The only thing I don't love is their chili - I find that it tastes a little burnt sometimes.  Otherwise, seriously, people, this place is great."}
{"text":"I saw this place on the Dragon's Den and the concept seemed quite interesting. I came here knowing that the experience would be an exercise in how to maximize the junkiness of junk food but I was at least expecting a solid junk food experience.

Our group shared a whole bunch of different options to get a feel for the menu and everything disappointed. I feel like there has to be more innovation possible in this newly created genre of food but what these guys have done, all looks fun and cool on a menu but goes down like a truly mistaken one night stand.

We will never go here again!"}
{"text":"So fun! This place takes your good old junk food favourites and turns them into exciting and new! They have come up with combinations I never could have imagined, and the novelty is so distracting you don't even think about the calorie count haha Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed with Junked. The waffle was practically bone dry, under-seasoned and overpriced, the tots were under-seasoned and tasted like grease, and the pulled pork smash was eh ok, but strangely sweet and not exactly what I was expecting after hearing some good things from people. Maybe at 3am this place would rock someone's world, but my food went unfinished."}
{"text":"I mean... I really want to give this place two star. It's really more of a novelty store (I would hesitate to call it a restaurant) than an actual establishment that serves food. We came in with a group of 7 of us at around 8 on a Friday night. The place had two other people inside. We ordered a few pizzas (mac and cheese pizza) and a few sandwiches. They only had one cook working and it took forever to get our food and they came out individually. I had the mac and cheese deep dish pizza. It was very rich and palatable. I left feeling quite lethargic and round.  I would not recommend going here unless it's 2 am and you are wasted. Good novelty idea though - but needs faster food."}
{"text":"This is the best place you need to be in if you're after a night out and looking for some great \"post 2AM food\", I however came in pretty sober and much earlier on in the night, so I'm sure my experience is likely different, since the place was quiet with mainly take-out patrons hanging around. 
Service was quite slow, and just guessing, it might be because I could only see 2 waffle makers in the back, so that might have contriuted to the slow service. And that slow service almost put these guys in the 3 star category, but it's the little things they do like having a phone charging station though, I think 

I got a mac and cheetos waffle...which was as good as you imagine it, but not something I can see myself having on a regular basis :) 

Overall, if I'm in the area and looking for anything that's not healthy Junked is definitely the place I'm going to come looking for."}
{"text":"Best soft serve I have ever had by far! I thought their soft serve had a unique taste. I had the \"Cereal Killer\" in a cup and loved the butterscotch with the combination of cereals. My fianc√© had a shake and thought it was great as well. I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"My group and I all ordered build your own soft serve cones and we pleasantly surprised with how good they were. I would say they are a bit over priced for each topping you add. 75 cents is a bit ridiculous for a small handful of cereal to be pressed on the side of your ice cream. Also the ladies working there were kind of rude. All of us said thank you when they handed us our orders and they gave us no \"you're welcome\" or response like such. But, when we were walking out they shouted a very sarcastic \"you're welcome\" that you'd expect to hear when a person never says thank you. What? We were polite to you the whole time we were there and cleaned up after ourselves. The food was good but service is eh"}
{"text":"Just walked by Junked. Yup, this place still smells gross. I can't believe I even stepped foot into this place with that scent wafting up my 'strils."}
{"text":"I love what this place has done in concept. They renovated the place to look good, especially with the salvaged wood box stools. The marketing and name fit perfectly with their idea of junk food bastardized with good toppings.
And perhaps if I was drunk when I arrived I would have taken on more of the menu, but in a sober state at 9pm there was some stupid voice in my head saying \"its a bit late to eat a donut grilled cheese and a bunch of other stuff, just get one thing that isn't served with a donut\" and opting for the Pulled Junk Waffle. 

I feel appeased with the size of the meal for $9 after tax, but unfortunately the flavours just didn't overly impress so 3 stars is generous as I can get at this point."}
{"text":"Had a pulled pork waffle and a smores waffle with my lady. Both are fantastic but I'd love it if the pulled pork waffle was made with corn flour or something savoury/spicy. It would go great with those pickles.

Next time we're catching a show at The Garrison, we'll go again."}
{"text":"Tried the grilled cheese doughnut. Good taste but pretty small for $7. They have a pretty wide variety of interesting foods. Next time I'll try the pulled pork waffel sandwich."}
{"text":"I much prefer this to Sweet Jesus. I got the peanut butter and jelly cup and it was amazing. The midget gems get a little too hard to eat though."}
{"text":"Junked Food Co offers so much diversity! We came here around 6pm on a Tuesday, and it was empty (provided that this is more of a late-night-bite spot). They offer soft serve, similar to Sweet Jesus or La Diperie, as well as comfort food. I ordered a pulled pork poutine. On top of the obvious ingredients, it had sauces that really elevated its flavours. My friend ordered the deep dish mac n' cheese pizza, which was simply creamy goodness. Our food took around ten minutes, so they probably make everything as orders come in.

I'm a bit torn about the interior. I can see how it can be beneficial when crowded, but the arrangement is somewhat odd. There are a few tall tables but no chairs, so I had to stand/tiptoe while eating my food (probably not as much of an issue if you are over 5'2''). There are also no washrooms, and the space is relatively small. However, the walls have such detailed decals, all with a fun font that emphasize the Junked brand. 

I'm not generally on the west side of Toronto, but Junked has convinced me to explore more options in the area."}
{"text":"First time here, visited because I won a small contest that Junked Food Co. was hosting on their Instagram. I tried their secret menu item that was Nutella-inspired, jalape√±o poppers covered in cream cheese and Nutella-coated with crushed Doritos, with chili cheese dip on a bed of Doritos. They have eat-in and takeout. Staff consists of two men and both were very friendly and I chatted with them. The place is very new, opened about three weeks ago. I would definitely return, even though I don't really visit near Ossington much. In terms of how the food tastes, this is no good for dinner or an actual meal, but rather a snack, a light meal or hangover food. The food is definitely interesting, but I wouldn't eat it regularly since there is quite a mix of things. The decor of the place is cool, there are signs and a backdrop that you can use to take selfies or a photo by yourself or with friends. There are two tables with a couple of highchair stools. The best part is there is an Archies comic book on each table, which is a favourite childhood comic book of mine and a very unique idea that brings back a lot of memories for me."}
{"text":"I've never had a sandwich with a waffle as the bread until I tried it here! It's a paradise for guilty pleasures after 2am nights on the town, but not my food preference in any other situation. Gotta give respect to whoever designed the menu though, it's as creative as it gets!"}
{"text":"Went there for desserts, but wasn't too impressed. Tried the waffle and their special, but was underwhelmed by their special. Will try the soft serve next time."}
{"text":"Junked Food Co. is here to take care of all your post 1-3AM cravings for food. I would like to re-assure you that while they are considered as \"the ultimate premium drunk food of Toronto,\" the food actually also tastes great sober! 

-Mac n' Cheetza Deep Dish: 
I adored the personal pizza which was was only 7\". It featured a moderately thick crust and is filled with delicious layers upon layers of mozzarella, mac n cheese, and a gracious amount of tomato sauce. Did I mention the cheese? Loved how the pasta was perfectly cooked, then enrobed in a rich, velvety cheese sauce. The tomato sauce had a slight tang which was a perfect compliment to that creamy mac n cheese

-S'Moreo Waffle: 
What is yummier than Oreo cookie and Milk? Of course Oreo waffles! For the waffle, the oreo were incorporated directly into the batter, cooked until golden brown with a crispy exterior and soft on the inside. The hot waffle was then smothered with fresh marshmallow fluff and torched for a slight toasty, nutty scent. As a final touch, Brian topped the Oreo waffle with some chocolate bits and drizzle all that with more chocolate sauce - an ultimate experience for any chocolate lovers.

-Tater Tots Poutine
 Instead of using the basic french fry, Junked Food Co.'s poutine used tater tots. They were perfectly fluffy on the inside and golden brown and crisp on the outside. Since the potato tots were able to absorb all the poutine deliciousness without getting soggy, the tots became juicy bombs of pleasure.

-Donut Ice Cream Sandwich
A FROZEN DONUT ICE CREAM SANDWICH?! I honestly didn't mind that the donut was frozen as it will hold the ice cream much better when you attempt to eat. To my surprise, the overall sandwich wasn't too sweet as there was a slight spicy-sweet-ish from their house-made famous sauce - the Swedish Berry jalape√±o sauce. I'm sorry, it's the bomb."}
{"text":"Super unique place!! They have pizza, ice cream, tater tots and more each with unique and different flavors. I got the \"Whack Mac\" which at first I was scared to try since there was both chocolate and ketchup in it but it was pretty good. The flavors were very unique and they surprisingly went well together. I als got a soft serve ice cream (Cookie Doh-Nut) and it was SO DELICIOUS and it was HUGE. The ice cream was super creamy and the topings just made it delicious, although it was a bit hard to eat since I was so scared that everything was going to fall off the cone. 

Would def. come back to try their other items!"}
