{"text":"Was a little surprised at the cost for the quality of food.   Very pricey for fast food Chinese.  Always on the hunt for good Chinese food that I remember from back East.   While I have yet to find it, this food in particular was greasy.   Will keep searching."}
{"text":"I ate inside the restaurant once and ordered take out many times. Each time the food is fresh and tasty. I recommend Beef Chow Fun, it's really yummy (if you like noodles)!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place but I always just drive by it on the way home. Finally, I decided to try it and I have probably made the best decision doing so. The staff here are nice and when I came through the door I was greeted and seated. I ordered takeout orange chicken with rice. The food was made to order and delicious.  Food tastes authentic and comes in great portions. Definitely will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Decent food but rude service. I called in an order of sweet and sour chicken with sauce on side and no veggies. I told the girl on the phone \"just chicken nothing else\". My wife went to pick up the order and there is chicken and pineapple in the container. Now the chicken is soggy. She tells the lady we just wanted chicken with nothing else. The lady told my wife \"If you dont like it then dont come back!\" Seriously?! Nice customer service. We wont be back."}
{"text":"We have been going to Dao Kitchen #2 for several years.  It is the BEST Chinese food in north Phoenix.  We usually have Sweet & Sour Chicken, Egg Foo Young or Orange Chicken.  Crab Puffs are great!"}
{"text":"Very good. Your typical American Chinese food, but good value on their lunch specials. I especially liked the Hot and sour soup.  The restaurant is in a new building and is very clean. If you're in the area definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"While picking up a take out order which they messed up on that's another story. Anyways, I had ordered two thai iced tea to go. Once I had paid, the girl who had helped me walked to the back to make it. I seen her looking confused and looking around the kitchen. She stood in the back for awhile with two empty plastic cups and walked back to the counter and told me she can't find covers for the cups. (How can you not have cup covers??? And why would you tell me, I can't do anything about it) So she walks back and makes my drinks in the plastic cups that have no covers. She tells one of the owners which that there's no cover for the cups. Another lady took over my order. She grabbed big Styrofoam cups that has covers, added more ice, and transferred the drinks from the plastic cups. (There was more ice than the drink it self) Which the girl should of made it in that cup from the beginning. After my drink was made the girl gave my drinks. I seen her walk back to grab the plastic cups, walked to the sink, rinsed it, and left it on the side. (I hope they don't reuse the cups and give it to another customer. Very unsanitary and gross.) Who knows if they reuse things there all the time. I waited for a total of 10 to 15 minutes for my drinks. 

After all that, they messed up on our take out order. We called back and also had mentioned about the girl rinsing the cups and hoping they won't reuse it for the next customer. She claims she threw it away but why would you rinse a cup and say you threw it away. Obviously theirs no cover for the cups...no reason to save it."}
{"text":"We moved to the area from out of state and had really good Chinese take-out. With our move to AZ we no longer had our favorite go-to restaurants. We ordered from a few different places before stumbling across Tao Kitchen with less than desirable experiences. It's close to our house and the food is good. It is a little pricey but I feel like you get a lot of food."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim & boy i wished we had tried this place sooner. Quality of food was better than most places. Up here in North Phx there isn't many food of this type/quality. Agreed with some of the reviewer about Orange Chicken. It was the best! Seafood Bird Nest was delicious. In fact. Pei Wei, PF Chang will lose my patron."}
{"text":"Growing up in the San Francisco bay area I have enjoyed good, authentic Asian cuisine all my life.  I was very surprised to find this excellent restaurant right in our backyard.  The Honey Walnut Shrimp is delicious, as is their Mu Shu pork and my hubby, who is not crazy about Chinese food, loves the Mongolian Beef.  We're big fans--take out is easy and fast.  Price is a bit high, but when you're fiending for good Chinese food, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Because of the new reviews on Yelp I thought I would give a second chance with new owners.  Stopped in to do take out lunch on Saturday.  Hard to tell it was open due to the black out sun screen but found the little \"were open\" sign.  Ordered the fried rice, orange chicken, beef/peas and then on the lunch menu pork.  Fried rice was very good. main dishes were good.  They put a snack and water on the bar for me to enjoy while I waited.  The spicy mustard is fresh and fantastic mixed with their red sweet sauce.  Glad I gave a second chance and would even try going as dine in because it was clean and quiet."}
{"text":"We've only been once, but I give this a 5 star for it's category of absolutely savory Chinese food at a medium price range and wide range of tastes. Excellent service as well. Lived in Asia for 3 1/2 years. The Happy House specialty is one of the best Chinese sauces I've ever tasted. My wife was a caterer and was really impressed with the presentation. They brought it out on a sizzling iron skillet. Got a window seat and enjoyed a classic Arizona sunset. Really happy all around and will come back often."}
{"text":"2015 Update:

Sine I love roast duck, I always give this place a try since it's across the street from my neighborhood.

After purchasing twice this month, they apparently have a new chef or the chef has learned better cooking techniques.  Oh so much better!  Food actually tastes good like in California.  White chicken meat is not dry and stiff anymore from over-cooking.  Sauces are tasty.

Orange chicken used to have a weird aftertaste that made our tongues itch.  Now it's awesome.  Curry chicken's potatoes are actually cooked now and not crunchy.  Beef with green beans, or snow peas or broccoli have a good sauce.

Low Mein (which is Chow Mein in Cali) is not so oily anymore and laden with green onions.  I always had to request no green onions.  Just needs more sprouts, but so much better now.

I'm ok paying more than Panda now that the quality and taste has greatly improved.  Good job guys.  Keep it up.

Now this place just needs Chinese music, a little more Chinese decor, and an aquarium or barrier at the front door to give the main dining area a more secluded feel.

2012 old review: 

Inconsistent.  

Two months ago, disappointed.  Last month and two weeks ago the food was great.  Yesterday, Hot and Sour soup was basically sour soy sauce.  No mushrooms or bamboo shoots.  Sweet and sour sauce was watery and not the excellent thick version a couple of weeks ago.  Kung Pao chicken didn't taste like Kung Pao.  Having peanuts does not constitute being Kung Pao.  I just wish the backup cook would cook the same as the primary cook.

Just because we live in the foothills should not be a reason to make Chinese food expensive $9-$12 a plate.  

A new place (Hong Kong Asian Cuisine) opened up down the road and it's unfortunately charging the same prices with almost the same menu."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place isn't busy all the time. The food is soooo fresh and Delish. It's even better after a good workout at the gym in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Rating A inspection. Fast, fresh, hot food for $7.50 lunch specials. Good choice if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Dao Kitchen is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant. I lived nearby for about a year, and ate there more times than I'd care to admit (even on Christmas Eve). My favorite things are: Orange chicken, orange beef, lo mein, and crab puffs, though they do many other things very well. If you like orange chicken, you have to try Dao Kitchen's. I also don't normally care for Hot and Sour soup, but I eat theirs every time.
The service has been great every time I've gone, and I really like that they bring you wontons and sweet & sour sauce when you eat in. You also get fried honey bananas after your meal if you get the dinner combo. Those are delicious. I got takeout quite a few more times than I ate in, and never had an incorrect order.
The worst thing about Dao Kitchen is how far away they are from where I live now, which just isn't fair. I miss it."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was expecting more. We order hot and sour soup, it was warm at best. My daughter ordered a thai ice tea - it was a cup full of ice with tea poured over it. Then we ordered the beef chow fun with no onions. Got chow fun with white and green onions. 

Maybe I'll try again for lunch, but dinner was a disappointment."}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say it was very good. Crispy wontons with sweet and sour to start. It was complimentary. My husband ordered the orange chickens and I had Kung pao! All white meat chicken, no parts or pieces. We enjoyed it all. We both got the combo meal with soup, egg roll and crab puff. We opted out of the soup that comes with combo and got sizzling rice soup! To die for! Very meaty with shrimp, chicken, and pork. Also lots of veggies! I will go back just for the soup! Best news ever, They Deliver!!!!! To my neighborhood!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and service is good but it's a little pricey. They do give large portions which is nice."}
{"text":"Not great, but not horrible. A bit below average. Not many good choices for Chinese food in the immediate area unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place is so much better since they changed owners.

My wife and I went when it was the old owners, it was terrible.  We waited forever and the food never came before we walked out.  People were served before us that walked in after and my wife actually got her soup before me and I sat and waited while they \"made more\".

It was horrible.

Now its much better.  The staff are very friendly, they treat their customers very well and I have nothing but positive things to now say about this place.  Its much better with the new owners."}
{"text":"I recently moved here from the east coast and, because this restaurant happened to be next door to Orange Julius/Dairy Queen, I decided to give it a try.  I was shocked at how plentiful and delicious the food was.  Their walnut shrimp dish is the best Asian dish I have ever tasted!!  Everything there is delicious and the service is also really good.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chx fried rice and orange chicken to go, which turned out to be great!  But while I was waiting, they brought me some tasty chips and sweet/sour sauce and a glass of water, none of which I had asked for.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is 10/10 the best chinese food I've had ever. I'm basically addicted to their Orange Chicken. One little known tip is that you can order any dish any spice level you want (0 to 10). The staff is very friendly and we eat here so often they remember our orders. Wish they delivered!

I honestly don't understand the bad reviews here. I work at a nearby company where we meet with people from other companies weekly. This is a popular place we take them for lunch. Over the past three years we've been eating here AT LEAST twice a month. We've probably had over 300 meals served to our table and not a SINGLE hint of dissatisfaction. Maybe competition trying to drive ratings down?

We have international people from China and Japan that travel to our nearby Phoenix location and they say is very authentic."}
{"text":"Awesome! Try the orange chicken, it is the best I have ever had. Their dinner deal is also a good deal for the amount you get. And this place is always nice and quiet! There's never a ton of noise, even though it is rather small. This is my go-to spot for Asian food on the north side."}
{"text":"we ordered take out cashew nut chicken. my wife and i got diarrhea. we will never order food here again. i hope the AZ food inspector reads this and pays them a visit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to come to, their food is amazing! I'd highly recommend the orange chicken and chicken lo mein!!! You will not be disappointed!!! I'd also like to add that the staff is so sweet!!! Please trust me when I say it's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Dao Kitchen to the rescue! Our take out the other night was delicious!  We enjoyed Sesame Chicken (crispy coating, moist chicken) and Snow Peas Beef (new to us - tender meat, lots of crispy snow peas, carrots and onions). To start the meal, Wor Won Ton Soup & Vegetable Eggrolls. Both were satisfying. So glad to have you in our neighborhood! Oh, and regarding the statement at the start of the review about \"to the rescue\" - our old haunt in Anthem is just not the same. Although we'd like to support both business establishments, you have won us over with your food, hospitality and price! Thanks Dao Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best and a bit pricey. I live only a few blocks from here and there aren't too many restaurants off carefree. Service was horrible! Took forever to get our drinks and after searching for a waitress for several minutes I got up and had to ask for silverware. After we got our food our waitress didn't come for Over 30 minutes and I eventually walked up to counter to ask for bill"}
{"text":"Service was really fast, was in and out in about 10 mins. Gave me chips to snack on while i waited for my take out lunch. Got the orange chicken lunch combo, was awesome, some of the best orange chicken I have had! Overall an awesome experience, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here tonight since my wife is traveling to see what the place is like. I really wanted to like this place, very close to my house. I would like to echo that the service and people are fantastic. However, the food is a 4 on a 10 scale. The Generals's chicken was heavily breaded, made of chicken parts and very salty. I am a bit of a health nut so I was hoping for more white chicken than bread. Fried rice was nice and so was the hot and sour soup. Would be nice to have some healthy options on the menu. I would pay an up charge for chicken breast not breaded."}
{"text":"Food - lousy.
Atmosphere - pathetic.
Servers - learn how to dress for work. If I had workers show up dressed in dirty shorts and what looks to be at least a 20 year old ripped t-shirt, I would send them home and I run a production warehouse.

No idea how this business survives."}
{"text":"My kids LOVE the Orange chicken!
The owners are very nice! It is a fun place to go with the family that doesn't break my budget!  Portions are great!  Enough to share!  The banana won tons are a great touch!  

Nice to have good old Chinese food instead of all that over rated \"Asian Fusion\" hype!"}
{"text":"Be AWARE when ordering the Pan Fried Noodles. We ordered the pan fried noodles and you literally couldn't pick up a single noodle without all the noodles coming with. They were so burnt and so fried we didn't even taste them because the outward appearance was so terrible!! We called and tried to ask about it but the person who answered said \"they are supposed to be like that\". Ummmm okay!?? The orange chicken was good though."}
{"text":"This place is getting better and better. The food is really good and the prices are pretty fair. 

The Chicken Teriyaki is great!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and I was pleasantly surprised. Food was flavorful and perfectly cooked. Service was slow at first but picked up and was quite wonderful. Their egg drop soup was one of the best I've ever had in the valley. Highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to eating here again when in the area."}
{"text":"The current owners are not the original owners (they sucked).  The people running the place now are great!  The food is wonderful - my husband and I are addicted to their War Won Ton soup and everything else we've tried has been great.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My family loves when I get food from this place. Take out is always on point. We all love the Orange Chicken. I love the little fried banana pieces they give you on the side. 

It is not the BEST Chinese food I have ever had, but it is GOOD and consistent. Their got and won ton soup is tasty too."}
{"text":"Authentic, fast, great food made to order, customized for special requests and never and issue

Like spicy? Order something on a scale from 1-10.

From the routine favourites kung po chicken/beef/shrimp to some more exotic creations.  Dao #2 is consistently great on quality and service.

The little touches like wontons & sweet and sour sauce... to honey banana wonton desserts... this is by far the best Chinese food around. 

Great bar selection too including great selection of bears and sakés.  

Chicken curry, beef and green onion are some great recommendations.  Chicken cashew is good too.

Want something light?  Dao will steam anything without sauces."}
{"text":"Dao is surprisingly good for quality Chinese food. My family and I are very happy to find this gem in an area with few good restaurants. The inside decor isn't special but trust me, the food is excellent and the prices and great. Lunch specials are especially great for tasty food at reasonable price. They have these fried honey banana caramelized bites that my wife loves and my kids can't get enough of the orange chicken or orange beef. My favorite is Kung Pao but honestly I need to try more of the menu, I am in a Kung Pao rut now since it's so good--fresh veggies and light chicken, not too heavy. Egg rolls and cream cheese wontons are a bit better than expected.  See you there--we're there 2-3 times per week either in a side booth or taking out. Dao will make you ask Panda Who??!"}
{"text":"Decent food, friendly staff. We usually order to go. Food is ready in 15 minutes. My only complaint is that some dishes are \"filled\" with onions as a filler (like the Beef Chop suey & Broccoli Beef). The dishes have good flavor, but half of the dish is onion. The twin flavors beef is delicious, as well as the fried rice and the egg rolls are some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Well, I disagree with the previous reviewer.  We love Tao Kitchen.  We've only sat down and eaten there once, but order take out a lot now.  The time we ate there, the service was fine, the won ton's were fine, I didn't care for the soup, but i don't really like soup anyway.  The orange chicken is the absolute best and we had the orange beef this week and it was very good too - not overbreaded, just darn good!  Their egg rolls are great and their crab puffs are mighty tasty as well.  Their lunch specials are a fantastic deal.  You get the same amount as you do at dinner, for a lot cheaper and lunch specials run until 4.  We sometimes go before 4 and just pick up dinner early to save a few bucks.  i welcome this gem to the neighborhood and hope they do well - we'll be crushed if they don't!"}
{"text":"Came once before and thought it was OK. To be fair tried again today with my daughter.  Should have stuck with my first impression Still just OK."}
{"text":"Awesome orange chicken and Kung Pao! I ordered the Dao Twin Flavor Chicken and would highly recommend it! Service is excellent and clean comfortable environment! Open on Sundays is also a plus. Don't hesitate give it a try."}
{"text":"OMG, I'm converted!  Please ignore my review of 10/2011 as this place has become much better.  Service? Check.  Lard-tasting food?  Gone.  Quality and value?  You bet!  I'm so glad to know there is a reasonably priced QUALITY Asian place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for the past year and I've never had a bad meal. Lo mein is excellent and we've had several entrées both chicken and beef and everything's been very good. A lot of the Chinese food seems to be more New York style Chinese food which is great for us. The wonton chips are homemade and excellent. The wonton soup is amazing, honestly probably the best thing on the menu. I'm super picky about wonton soup and this one does not disappoint at all. The wontons are light and made from scratch. I feel like this place is hidden and a lot of people don't know about it in the area. It's definitely the best Chinese food in the area by far."}
{"text":"Yuck! If I could give less than 1 star I would. This is probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I ordered the chicken lo mein, and it was greasy, tasteless, and bland. My coworker order shrimp lo mein and it was the same. What a waste of money, it was totally in-edible."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely adore it here. Usually when you go to a Chinese restaurant and get large portions, you sacrifice quality but that is not the case with Dao.  The food is so so yummy, and we have left over for snack and lunch for days. We took my father in law who is kind of snobby about food and he could not stop talking about how much he enjoyed it. Recommendations are the pepper steak, orange chicken, chicken lo mein and cashew chicken. They also give you a complimentary dessert that I've never had anywhere but here. They stuff little won tons with banana,  fry them and then drizzle with honey. They are heavenly. The service is awesome and our waiter that we always have goes out of his way to keep my 3 year old happy and that's pretty epic to me."}
{"text":"The food is consistently great.  Ask for the banana pastry :)"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was great and very flavorful. Nice little bar to walk into and have a beer while you wait for your order. Would easily recommend and will visit again."}
{"text":"The food is very good. First Chinese food place in Phoenix I really like."}
{"text":"We like to pick up from here occasionally and have Chinese at home. The food is pretty good. Not breaking any records but definitely hits the spot when were in the mood for Chinese.  We usually order potstickers, hot and sour soup and Mongolian beef and sweet-and-sour pork.  My favorite thing that they have is the banana wontons they give as dessert, they are really delicious and I've never had those at a Chinese restaurant before."}
{"text":"My first visit here I wasn't impressed. I tried to order white rice, and the waiter couldn't understand me after repeating myself 3 times so he brought me fried rice. It was just okay. 

However, the second time my boyfriend and I came here we were quite impressed. We walked in at 7:45 PM on a Monday night and the place was empty. We were the only ones there. The waiter this time spoke and understood good English, which was nice, but he was a tad bit awkward. But that's OK. 

Every meal service starts out with complimentary wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce. We ask for a side of spicy mustard with them. Try it- it makes them taste a lot better! We ordered some crab puffs to start. Six of them come per order for around 5/6 dollars. They are quite small, so the price for the value is just alright. Otherwise, they're pretty good and are not overly cream-cheesy like the ones you'll find at other Chinese places. 

For dinner I ordered the string bean beef and my boyfriend ordered the orange chicken both with white rice. My string bean beef was exceptional. Not to mention the portion was HUGE (like 2 meals worth and I can eat a lot!) which made the price of around $12 worth it. I'm not a huge fan of orange chicken so I didn't try his, but my boyfriend really seems to like it and he is the pickiest of picky eaters. They also give you a really nice portion of rice which is cooked really well. 

Altogether, the meal with two drinks came to about $35, which isn't bad considering the portion sizes. Much better than Panda Express value. Perhaps my favorite part of the meal are the complimentary banana desserts that they give you that are wrapped in wonton paper and coated in a crunchy caramel like sauce. SO good!"}
{"text":"As many have said before me, get the orange chicken. We don't eat out often, but this is darn delightful when we do."}
{"text":"It's not surprising that Yelp doesn't even have the name correct.  Their name is Dao Kitchen.  And knowing Yelp, this business has asked them to correct it and they won't because that would mean helping a business that isn't buying their advertising and that just doesn't happen with Yelp.  Now... Back to my favorite Chinese food in the valley.

We've been a regular of DAO KITCHEN 2 for over 3 years now.  It has always been fantastic.  Highly recommend their House Fried Rice and the Orange Chicken.  The Green Beans and Beef is also top notch.

Service has always been great too.  Not sure the two reviews below are even reviewing the same restaurant, since Yelp has the name wrong, because this family is all about service and excellent food.  The size of the servings are crazy big.  They could have used a little more imagination in the decor, but everything else overtakes that one little thing."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I've eaten a number of times but today the meal was just not good at all."}
{"text":"The Garlic Eggplant was a mass of overcooked goo in a thick, sticky sweet sauce that did not resemble garlic. The only sauce that wasn't full of sugar was the Snow Peas Beef and it was ruined by an overabundance of corn starch.
The people in the booth next to us had an unruly child who kept body slamming himself against the back our booth. Apparently they were related to the cook because he kept coming out to talk to them."}
{"text":"Awesome food and really good service! Average prices but the portions are HUGE! Will definitely be going there again!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out beef and broccoli was decent but moo goo gai pan was bad, basically no sauce and what little there was was more or less broth, the only veggies in it was a few mushrooms and pea pods.

Very pricey for take out and doesn't include rice!!!

Unfortunately will not be returning, very disappointed was hoping for a good Chinese take out near home."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese food I've had since I've moved to Arizona. I haven't tried a lot of different dishes because I get pretty stuck in my ways, but for what I've tried its been good. I usually order to go and while I wait I have a beer and complimentary wontons. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Really good food won't be disappointed. Wish was more spicy orange chicken is best not too much batter. Ate here tonight and was terrible the Terri chicken was so salty we threw it out. Called and complained"}
{"text":"The best Orange kitchen I've had. Its full of flavor and crispy. The Wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce over spicy mustard is Complementary and addictive. The service is amazing. Love the atmosphere. Great food, great service and staff what more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"It's been hard to find a Chinese place that matched the one we left behind, but this was very good.  We did take-out on the way back to Cave Creek from the White Tanks because it's on our way home along Carefree Highway from 17..  DH had Garlic Chicken and I had the Black Pepper Beef.  Generous quantities, everything seemed very fresh and flavors were good.  Got number 5 spicy for both---could have upped that a bit, but you never know the first time. Upped mine with the addition of a spring roll and crab puff---both tasty, but not extraordinary.  But as an unexpected bonus, we got two little fried wontons with bananas on them and drizzled with honey---oh my gosh, they were so good!  What a nice surprise!  I don't see them on the menu, but I'd order a bag of them if I could.  Too bad they are almost 15 miles from our house, but definitely, if we are back that way and craving Chinese, we would make Dao our go-to!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent for Chinese food. It's not horrible but it's not great. We have eaten here multiple times over the last year and the service just gets worse and worse. Last time we were here, the put the wrong food on people's tables and then took it back and have it to the other table. This is a health code violation. Once the food has been placed, it isn't suppose to be removed. Today, my spring roll was still ice cold on the inside so we let them know and they replaced it. Then, the orange chicken was room temperature. I'm not sure how they reheated it. This is the last time we will be coming here."}
{"text":"Service was slow and inattentive, and I did not enjoy the food. Ambiance is nil. I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"We've been driving past this place for years, finally tried it tonight. Food was great, service was excellent, and the restaurant was very clean and inviting. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service is fantastic, friendly, and fast. I  
ordered takeout and they gave me complimentary water, and wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce. My order was correct, and was given to me promptly. I got the chicken fried rice, and crab puffs they were good, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast service and really good dishes, I'd check out Tao's Kitchen Asian Bistro. Very friendly staff, large portions, reasonable prices and a really good Orange Chicken keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the service was even better.   This is my second visit to the restaurant,  both times getting the Kung Pao Chicken and the Pork Lo Mein.  First visit was take out, the order was perfect. Second time was dine in and we were not disappointed.   The Chicken Egg Rolls were excellent and the Crab Puffs are wonderful."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  The twice cooked pork is excellent.  It's a family owned restaurant and they are very friendly.  In fact they remember my name every time I come in.

Their food is always fresh and hot.  If you like spicy, they will customize your if you ask."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area. Great food and service, this is my favorite spot to stop for take out on my way home."}
{"text":"We tried to pick up a to-go menu but ended up staying for lunch because our mouths watered thinking about their food. You won't be disappointed in the quality or quantity of the food. This is one of our favorite places to eay"}
{"text":"Been here twice now...super yummy!

I'm tried their garlic eggplant - added chicken, orange chicken and fried rice... can't remember what my friends had but they all enjoyed their meals!

Definitely worth the drive :)"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced and the quality of the food was not that good. The Restaurant was clean and the staff fairly friendly. I did notice a couple customers complaining about their orders, which seemed to upset the management in the form of them being rude to the customer. Not on my"}
{"text":"Always consistently good food! Recommend House Noodle Soup and Mongolian Beef with Shrimp. A hidden gem in Sonoran Foothills area."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great service. Prices are very reasonable. The daily (mon - fri) lunch specials are a good deal with all meals coming with soup, eggroll , filled wonton, rice, and your choice from a very good selection of entrees."}
{"text":"This place is really underrated. If you get there before 4pm you can get the lunch portion... It's a lot of food! The banana treats they give you after your meal are delish!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, great flavors! We went in for take out and the entire staff was so nice.  Gave us water and noodles while we waited.  I have found my new favorite chinese place!!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Seattle, home of some of the best asian food on the continent, I'm very disappointed in this and it's local.  I've struck out on 3 different chinese and 2 different thai places...honestly folks, it's so easy to do well in this arena...yet it's all bland, flavorless, overcooked and this was chewy to boot...never again"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE !!!def not what it use to be and the service was terrible . I ordered a hot great tea and when I poured the cup a spider was in my tea , no big deal I figured maybe the pot had been on a counter and this is az it happens gross but whatever , I told the waiter there was a spider in the teapot and I was ok with my root beer . He apologized and took it away . We ordered the walnut chicken and the pu pu platter for 2 , the platter was burnt . And there was a long black hair in the bottom of the walnut chicken so we didn't find it until we are a pretty decent amount yuck . When we pointed out the hair the waiter said btw that wasn't a spider and I don't know how a hair got in there ."}
{"text":"Last nights meal was filled with dry fatty chicken. This place had been pretty good for the last year but now...."}
{"text":"My family and I normally go to Dao Kitchen #1 and love it there! We would drive 45 minutes just to eat there and now I'm 35 weeks pregnant and was craving it but didn't want to drive so we met up with our friends, my husband and daughter here as it's so closer. We got our drinks and waited about 20 minutes to be asked what we'd like and we had to ask for the fried chips and got them right when our food came out. I ordered the beef and broccoli and my husband the sesame chicken and we would share them together with our daughter. Our friend got the curry chicken. My beef was bloody and cold and I obviously can't eat that being pregnant. My husband asked for them to re make it and for it to be to go. My friends chicken was chewy and odd tasting so she requested that be taken off her order and she will pay for her rice only. They re made mine and hers within 5 minutes so you automatically know they aren't fresh at all. She again said she didn't want hers. Everyone in the restaurant heard the chef YELLING that we don't want the food and it was so humiliating! He then came out stared at us and shook his head at us. It's not our fault he gave us raw food and old tasting chicken! My husband got so upset and I took our daughter outside and he told them to take the to go beef and broccoli back and he's not paying for any food. He said the lady was so mad throwing her hands in the air. He gave her a 20 bill for the drinks and told her to give the rest for our waitress. We will never go back there it really ruined our thoughts about their restaurant and we won't be going back. Very poor service and not professional at all."}
{"text":"Chinese food is definitely individual specific.  While I loved the people and the place... had a glass of wine while awaiting my order, I was not really impressed with the food.  The General Tso Chicken was not very crispy or have much spice.  The Sweet & Sour Chicken was over-cooked and tough.  The Lo Mein noodles were thick and too soft.  The crab puffs were pretty greasy and the pastry was a bit tough.  The Egg Drop soup was pretty runny also.  I felt it was very expensive and in need of a better chef.  The people at the front made it a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I also disagree with the first reviewer. After seeing that Suzanne C wrote a nice review my husband and I decided to give TKAB#2 a try. Being that we live just down the street from them (and I couldn't find the phone #: here it 623.516.8886, plus the website for the menu www.tao-kitchen.com)...I drove down there to get some take-out. I asked the waitress what she suggested and she said the garlic eggplant and orange chicken. I went with her suggestion with fried rice with the orange chicken. 

As I waited, she offered me some fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard. A nice gesture as I waited. The wontons were good..I mean I'm not sure what Greg B. expected from just tiny pieces of fried dough...but they were a nice little crunchy snack.

The waitress that was behind the bar was very nice to me, made small talk and was nice to other customers as I observed her interactions. Sitting there for about 15 minutes or so, I notice that MANY take-out orders came in over the phone...and many individuals walked in to pick up as I was there (many of them ordered General Tso's Chicken...maybe we will get that another time). 

Onto the food...

I TOTALLY agree with Suzanne...the Orange Chicken was GREAT! Very lightly breaded...all white meat and just really really tasty! The Garlic Eggplant was also super great especially over brown rice YUM! 

My husband and I would for sure go back there! I hope that they have a longer survival than the previous restaurant b/c we truly lack in decent eateries in this part of town."}
{"text":"We had high hopes.  But it's just as bad as The place it replace.  Is it the same cook and owners with just a new name?

We ordered 4 meals.  
2 Familystyle Tofu..which was a horrible spices sauce over Tofu. 
A green bean with black bean sauce, that was mushy and bland. 
And something they think is Gen Tso's chicken that was beyond bad.  Some fried strips of chicken in a bitter sauce and a few peppers. Probably that same sauce used on the Tofu. 

BTW the fried rice was nothing more than rice and bits of egg clumped with soy sauce, really bad. 

They might want to travel to a few other Chinese restaurants to see how it's done.  For the price I could have gone to PeiWei and at least gotten something worth eating.  Not that PeiWei is Chinese , but it is at least edible."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. I would try it again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. It's a family run joint, the service is pleasant, and the menu is extensive enough to please most. 

The addictively crunchy little wonton chips with spicy mustard (ask for extra if you're feeling brave) make for a lovely start. The orange chicken, with light breading, tender meat, and a gentle coating of tangy sauce, is a family favorite. The mapo tofu is a surprise hit, with soft tofu and a generous serving of ground pork. And the caramelized banana bites at the end are a really nice finish. The beer and wine selection is surprisingly decent, and pairs well with the food.

The atmosphere is... a bit lacking, hence the four rather than five star review. But it's definitely my go to for miles around Desert Hills."}
{"text":"Had the Mongolian beef lunch special - was probably the best Mongolian beef I've had in PHX. It's tough to find good Chinese food in PHX but based on my meal, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"After reading some positive reviews on this place, we decided to stop in and give it a go.  We were the only diners in the entire restaurant, during dinner hours, not a good sign.  All of the food was very greasy and tasteless.  We ordered cashew nut chicken, after being told it was all white meat, and we were very underwhelmed.  It was sticky, tasteless, and the chicken was very chewy.  The spring roll and crab puffs were very oily.  The egg drop soup had formerly dried chicken that had been reconstituted.  Everything we ordered missed the mark.

The staff was very nice, and the service was prompt, but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome hot and sour soup.  I've got to go back soon.  The sweet and sour chicken was good too but the soup was killer.  Put some in your face."}
{"text":"Always good food and quick service from a take-out perspective. I would love if they delivered and that would earn an extra star. Only down side is they are a little pricey, but having only one other competitor in the area it's to be expected."}
{"text":"The service was nice and friendly, nice environment but the food was so sub par. We had the lunch special Kung pao chicken and orange chicken. We each got the sweet and sour soup which was ok and asked for the fried rice which was not anything like fried rice -no veg, no egg, just mush. The orange chicken tasted like KFC tossed in orange sauce, the Kung Pao chicken was bland. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Orange chicken is delicious! Seriously... Get the orange chicken. I have tried other things on the menu and have never been disappointed. The staff are really friendly which is a nice change compared to other places in the anthem/north phoenix area. If your looking for good take out this is the best place around."}
{"text":"Their crab puffs are excellent, as is there chicken fried rice (which they prepare fresh as demonstrated by the fact that you can ask them to leave out the peas for example (a friend of mine does this) and they do it, no problem. Several other dishes are good too, the only thing I was underwhelmed with was the curry - nowhere near enough spice for me, very bland."}
{"text":"Much left to be desired after ordering late night takeout from Dao Kitchen. Skimpy on ingredients. Sesame chicken was well cooked but dry due to lack of sauce. Fried rice was in sore need of butter, garlic, seasoning, mushrooms, egg, soy sauce or care of any kind. Very Disappointing as it is a family owned Chinese establishment close to my apartment. I expected so much better for a $12 price-tag. I wanted to become a regular here but I refuse to support this kind of mediocrity with my hard earned dollars and I encourage you not to as well. If you are debating whether to give this place a shot and have come to yelp to decide hopefully this review can serve as a barometer and I can save you and your family from wasting your time here. Phoenicians should demand more from our Chinese food options than solid portion sizes. People leaving 4-5 star reviews are not being critical enough, have very low standards and/or have never had good Chinese food before. If ownership/ management reads this review, I am calling on you to step up your game."}
{"text":"I live nearby the #2 location near Carefree Hwy and have eaten in the place several times since it opened last fall.   Not as busy inside with diners as it used to be when it first opened but they do a fair amount of carry out orders.  The restaurant is clean but the place is kind of weird with too many TV's and just one big space.  The wall appliques of various people are strange too, rather stereotypical, if you ask me.

Now to the food, it's good and you get a lot for your $.  I would actually rate it 3 1/2 stars but Yelp won't let you do 1/2 stars. Not the best Chinese I have ever had but reliable and the wait staff is attentive and the food comes out quick  They were smart to open where they did because there is a lack of Asian choices in the area.  They even wrap up your leftovers for you, which is a nice touch.
 
Ordered carryout last night and got the Gen. Taos Chicken and Orange Beef, good tastes and the food held up well getting home (not too soggy!).  Like most Chinese food it was too salty.

Looks like a new Chinese place is coming near the Albertson's on Carefree Hwy.. Moon something?, So let's see what a little competition does.  Maybe one of them will start delivery (hint, hint!)

I will return!"}
{"text":"Make sure you are very clear what you order. My wife ordered food and asked specifically about the noodles that came with a meal. When the noodles came out they were absolutely different. I then drove to the business and the lady at the counter charged us full price for the correct noodle. I will not be coming back to this place and will tell everybody I know. The food we picked up for that to go order was cold and the chicken was bone dry. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered pork lo mein , I got spaghetti! !!!,  it was hands down the worst I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Everything tasted great! the orange chicken i had was delicious and filling and they were quick to cater to us when needed. I appreciated every bit of it!"}
{"text":"Mm mm mm! I miss Chinese Food takeout/delivery from NYC. I was a bit skeptical when the suggestion came up for \"good chinese\". But heck, I'll try anything once.

I didn't spend much time looking at the menu. I figured there had to be an option for \"broccoli chicken\" and... there was! Adding brown rice for two meals cost $1. (I did look to see if they had a \"healthy menu\". Alas, no. There didn't seem to be steamed options for veges or chicken.)

We called and were told \"fifteen minutes\". True to their word our food was waiting for us on time. The restaurant was brightly lit and the employees were super, duper chipper. (No time to check out the bar!)

The portion sizes for a meal are enormous. It's quite possible to have two serving sizes (at least for a woman) out of a meal. I thoroughly enjoyed my broccoli chicken, as well as the \"two twin flavor chicken\" I fork sampled. 

In addition for the usual fortune cookies Dao Kitchen threw in something unusual. I'll have to return to update this. I have a photo but not the name. It was a a room temperature fried wonton covered with honey. Inside was something sweet. I still don't know what to make of it, but I ate it!

Our two meals with tax came to $24.59

I enjoyed this experience and food. Unbelievable customer service with plenty of smiles."}
{"text":"My husband and I pick up our dinner from here once every 1-2 months. The orange chicken is phenomenal! We also like their House Lo Mein, Egg Drop Soup, crab puffs and they have great lunch combos at awesome prices! The portions are large and we always have leftovers!"}
{"text":"Not very good - I have tried this place 4 times in the last year, really hoping to find one dish I enjoy  so far, i haven't found one dish good enough for a return visit. 
The prices don't match the quality (or lack there of) of the food they sell. How disappointing- as there are so few Chinese restaurants up in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"My favorite and the best Chinese restaurant in AZ.  Great value, especially lunch specials. Everything is fresh and tastes great.  Their chicken spring rolls and Orange Chicken are both amazing, also try their Moo-shu Pork and San Shien.  They will make any dish as spicy as you want too.  3x spicy will make you sweat."}
{"text":"The WORST egg foo young I have ever eaten! No veggies unless you count the bean sprouts??? All egg and no foo...
My friend ordered shrimp with veggies and it was decent. 
For the price $$ it was not impressive. 
Not returning!"}
{"text":"Not very good. That's putting it mildly. Never refilled our cups and the food came out cold and flavorless. Asked for chili sauce and even their chili sauce could barely improve the flavor of the food. Ordered Moo Shoo and Lo Mein both with chicken. Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone in search of true Chinese/Asian food. This is a great restaurant for the average American looking for your Americanized crap that gets passed off as Asian food."}
{"text":"As a fellow Asian American.  I always would have to go to the east side to get great authentic Chinese food.  Many individuals will probably go for the orange chicken and kung pao chicken.  I have to tell you that the duck here is one of the best that i have ever had.  The meat is tender and it is not all greasy and oily.  I have also had a the green beans and beef.  The green beans were still fresh tasting and the beef is very tender.  We also had the napa tofu which is a vegetarian dish that is very tasty.  

At first I was going to give them 4 stars, but the more that I eat there the more I love this place.  Take it from a traditional Asian couple this place is well worth the try,"}
