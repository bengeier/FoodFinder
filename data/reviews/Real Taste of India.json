{"text":"This place was pretty good... I had the Tandoori Chicken, which was a generous portion and was the best I've ever had taste wise. My friend had the butter chicken and it was very sweet, but we had requested spicy. Other than that everything was fine. I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Just tried to call this place, and the phone says it doesn't accept incoming calls... Did they go under?"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The staff are awwwwesome, very attentive and helpful. The garlic naan has real shaved garlic baked on it, which was very nice. The meat is plentiful (but maybe that's because you're paying around $11-$13 for a bowl of curry about the size of your palm, the lamb wasn't quite as tender as another reviewer said which was basically my sole purpose for ordering it). But I'm just not quite sold. $5 for a tall but very skinny glass of mango lassi that tastes like the yogurt's gone off and about $3 for a bowl of raita that's smaller than the curry and also tastes like the yogurt's off. I'm nervous cause I feel like I'm about to feel sick at any moment but maybe I'm too new to Indian cuisine to realize that's normal? It's got a very nice mood for dinner with candles, the window opens wide so a couple diners can look out over the pavement. Apparently the lease is up and the building owner has given the new lease to the current cook who is reinventing the restaurant with a new name, new menu etc. Supposed to premiere in about a week. I'll stop by when it's up and running. Maybe tonight was a fluke and they were just finishing up their current stock of food.."}
{"text":"When we visited, there were no other clients, no wait staff. The cook continued to read his paper for ten minutes or so after we sat down. This was the point at which we should have left, but didn't. Eventually he shuffled over, gave us menus and told us what they were out of. Then he continued to read his paper, but eventually he took our order. He was clearly annoyed by having customers. When the food arrived, it was edible. We live only three blocks away, but I don't imagine we'll go again."}
{"text":"(Would actually have given 3.5 stars if possible.  BTW, what does A-OK mean?  Should it just be \"OK\"?  Going from \"Meh\" to \"A-OK\" seems like too big a leap.  Am I right, people?)

Ordered in last night.  Had the Aloo Gobi, Mattar Paneer, pilau rice, naan, raita and an order of pakoras (6).

The potato and cauliflower in the AG was recognisable, which isn't always the case.  The MP was a bit too saucy...not enough peas and \"cheese\".   The complimentary papadums were a nice touch.

They didn't ask about spice, and we didn't specify, so it was not \"hot\" at all.  It was tasty though, so we'll order again."}
