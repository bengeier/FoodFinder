{"text":"Decided to try this place after we saw the sweet Nelly Belly food truck at Edgewater a few weeks ago. 

I ordered carry out from the restaurant to avoid waiting in line to order...but picking up an order and placing one are done in the same line.

My steak and shroom belly had so much potential based on the description on the menu. Unfortunately a few key things were missing (goat cheese and cream sauce) and it was very burnt, I know it's a wood fired dough, but this was burnt and so were the sweet potato fries. My boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger and fries both if which were low quality like you would get in a school cafeteria.

For $22 you'd think that it would just be better. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a chicken parm sandwich.  It was the worst ever.  Threw half in the trash can.  My husband had a pizza that was disappointing.  Half of it was soggy.  We will never return.  The prices are high and the food is horrible."}
{"text":"I came here with a party of 12 for lunch. We were able to set up the tables and chairs in the gazebo area to our preference. You place your order inside and they will deliver it to your table. I ordered a Rosemary's Belly Pizza and it was out of this world fantastic! The flavor was amazing and the crust was baked to perfection. The view here is beautiful and it's a nice escape from the office during the work week. I will be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Very good and inexpensive wood-fired pizzas. Humble Wine Bar's might be a little better but they're twice the price, and you can't beat the view here. Also they have Honey Hut ice cream now, so that's extra points in my book. Use the side door of the Marina building or enter through the Marina shop. They're open daily 11 a.m. - 8 p.m. during Memorial Day through Labor Day."}
{"text":"We came in through a Groupon and this was a great find. We'll definitely be back. The personal pizzas were so fresh and delicious. Great service and beautiful location!"}
{"text":"Came here after paddle boarding to get some pizza.   We had been wanting to try this place, and I will say, it was very delicious!!  Great patio seating as well.     

Although I was a little disappointed when I asked for a pizza to-go box for the rest of my pizza that I had just spent $9 on (personal pan size), and was told by the girl making pizza that the to-go boxes were 'too expensive' & that I had to ask the other lady at the ice cream counter for a different to-go box... 

Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars!!  I would say this pizza is very comparable to Mellow Mushroom Pizza down the road."}
{"text":"This is a review of the food truck, not the restaurant - or even the food for that matter.  I purchased a \"pizza party for 50 people\" voucher at a charitable silent auction. The voucher reads good through October 2015 or April - October 2016.  The truck closed early for the winter, in September 2015.  Not a big deal - I waited until this summer to book the party. The experience has been horrible. Each time we call and mention that we have a voucher, our calls are not returned.  When we've called and NOT mentioned a voucher, we get an immediate call back - but then mention the voucher, and they say they have to call us back to schedule it.  Again, we get no return call.

At this point, it's been more than half a dozen calls and several emails sent by two different people in my organization over at least two months.  I've even moved the date once - their website showed a date was available and we'd left several message to book that date.  We never got a call back in time to send invitations.  We clearly need to use the voucher before the October expiration, so we chose another another date that was listed as available on their website and tried again.  Same deal - no return calls.  Now I have to use a different caterer for the second date because this time invitations were mailed.

I am still working with them to get this redeemed.  In fairness, I will update this review when and if they come through on their gift certificate and will review the food and service."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years back when it was Sweetwater.  It was a beautiful venue then, but has declined over the past two years.  The tables are way overdue for a paint job and some are missing seats.  The trash cans are rusted and gross and the once beautiful landscaping is now a big weed field.  There is usually trash on the patio.  It is in dire need of sprucing up.  As for service, last evening we arrived at 6:30 p.m. and  our food was brought to our table at 7:05.  Some days the food is good, other days just mediocre.  This is one of the most beautiful places to eat on the water, but is in desperate need of cleaning up."}
{"text":"First, let me say, I will be going back to Nelly Belly. I don't believe on judging a restaurant strictly on one experience--perhaps they just had an off day.

When I heard they had a wood-fired oven, I immediately became excited. I ordered the pepperoni and three cheese pizzas. The crust was flavorless and had an odd texture. The cheese and sauce didn't taste that fresh. I would recommend the chef take a pilgrimage to NYC to find out how real wood-fired pizza is made. I know that sounds elitist, but why not? If you've already invested in the expensive oven, why not go all the way? I'm just going to add this a long list of awful pizza experiences I've had in NE Ohio."}
{"text":"What can I say. Sitting in the gazebo looking out over the river is so...so.....great. We dock our boat here and have seen a few restaurants come and go but Nelly Belly is one of the best. 

The personal sized pizza is tasty and the crust baked in their wood oven is amazing. The quarter pound burgers are impressive and the choice of toppings make them even more delicious. You get juicy, flavorful, all beef burgers every time. They have grilled chicken, veggie burgers and other deli sandwiches to choose from, but what we love the best on a hot summer day is one of their delicious salads. I get the COBB salad, full of turkey, ham, bacon, Swiss, tomatoes, onions, avocado, eggs and croutons. It is very filling. 

They have a limited beer and wine selection, and you can drink alcohol outside on the restaurant's patios. You can also make any order a platter, which adds a drink (16 oz. beverage, not beer or wine) and side for only $3.00. Their sides include crinkle-cut fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, hush puppies, fruit cup, side salad, cup of chowder, dirty chips or pretzels. All good selections. 

The prices are average compared to most bar type food, but what is so....so....great and sets this restaurant apart is the atmosphere. It's sitting by the water having a drink and eating great food with friends, and every Friday in the summer they have free entertainment. 
LIFE IS GOOD! 
 
The only down can be the long lines at high ordering times like lunch and dinner. Only one spot to order with only one register.  But, you order and pay all at once and they bring it to your table. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"This place is a lot better than its predecessor in the same location.  I had a really good perch sandwich with some very savory hushpuppies!  Hushpuppies!!!  You can sit outside on the tables right next to the place or in the fenced-in area extending to a gazebo of sorts, and enjoy a Dortmunder, while watching the boaters, kayakers, and waterfowl.  

[When dining outdoors:  Beware of aggressive house sparrows.  Don't feed them!  When you aren't looking and you're thinking about their adorable dust baths, they kill native birds like eastern bluebirds.]"}
{"text":"Nelly Belly!

We first came across this place, as they had a food truck available downtown, by the \"thisiscle\" yoga event and Gay Games festivities. We saw the great looking pizzas, ran up to them, and exclaimed \"wait, where are you located?!\"

Nelly Belly is situated inside the Rocky River metropark. A little bit of a random location (I personally think they would be great along a strip in Lakewood or something of that sort), Nelly Belly boasts some great food.

They have all different types of food- sandwiches, piadinas, and pizzas, all made in a stone oven. That roped us in- being big pizza lovers, we ordered the margarita and the shroom carbonara. It was a solid pizza with four pieces- not too heavy, not too light, with a slightly chewy crust. I really liked it. The Margarita had just the right amount of mozzarela slices on it with grape tomatoes and tasty sauce. The shroom carbonara had mushrooms, bacon of some sort? and some sort of super cheesy cheese on top of it. Overall, they were great. I think the stone oven they bake their pizzas in is key to the overall taste.

So, if you're ever hiking around the Rocky River reservation, and want to stop in for a great tasting meal, give Nelly Belly a try. It's not one of those fancy places sometimes in parks (looks like it from the front), but once you try the food.... you'll like it immediately- and say, \"that's my type of food.\" Go for a hike and try Nelly Belly sometime!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My daughter and I stop in and order the French fries before our walks along the rivers edge. Great little restaurant attached to the marinas shop. Awesome pizza also!"}
{"text":"My BFF and I came here for lunch today.  We were the only ones dining as their open-year-round status is fairly new and not yet widely known.  Our sandwiches were wrapped like gyros but were made from wood fired pizza dough.  She had the steak/mushroom/cheese and I had the chicken salad.  Both were delicious!  We split an order of sweet potato fries and I'd do THAT again in a heartbeat!  They were fantastic!  Friendly and helpful waitstaff made the experience all the better.  The desserts looked yummy but we were too full to partake.  I can't wait to return and try another sandwich!

I did return two days later with Hubby in tow.  Alas, they closed at 3.  I did not pay attention to posted winter hours.  FYI - plan to have lunch there, at least for awhile!"}
{"text":"Yum!! We came after a few hours of kayaking on the water and were so happy we did! You walk in and order at the counter and then they bring it to you. We were there on the 4th of July and there was live music which was so nice. The tables outside are on the water and on a perfect day with live music, you really can't beat it. As for the food, we were pleasantly surprised. I ordered the cranberry chicken salad and it was huge! He ordered the Lake Erie perch sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries and a side of hush puppies. Get the hush puppies if you go...the sauce with them is awesome and the cornmeal they use is somewhat sweet! He was also torn between ordering a pizza (they make them in an applewood oven) and a sandwich but when the sandwich came, he said he got the best of both worlds because the bread of the sandwich was their pizza crust. :-) We can't wait to go back on another nice day!!"}
