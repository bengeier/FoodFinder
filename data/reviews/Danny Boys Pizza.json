{"text":"Stopped in for a couple pizzas with 3 other people. Place was dead. Place looked pretty cool inside. Pizza was fairly good. Ownership was in contact with me and my fiance and she quickly made it so we felt comfortable coming back. She was very nice and I'm glad they made the time to reach out. Need more owners like this. We live in NOlmsted and we will be back. We prefer to support local businesses like this. Thanks Renee and Robert."}
{"text":"I will usually give a place a second chance, but Danny Boys won't be getting that second chance.  The food I had was overpriced and wasn't good. This was a takeout. I ordered what I thought would be easy.  An appetizer of tater tots -- bland.  Pepperoni pizza for me -- I couldn't find the pepperonis and the pie was swimming in sauce. My roommate had the Italian cobb salad and found it all very tasteless.  Add to bland/bad food are the outrageously high prices for what we got and that just makes sure that we won't be going back again.  Even the staff that were there didn't seem all that enthusiastic. There were a line of people picking up take out orders and after giving a name, we were all ignored until our order came up.  A couple of people left without their orders because they had to wait too long.  With all the other restaurants in the area, Danny Boys is last on my list of places to go."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken parm woogie melt and a calzone. Both were excellent! We definitely want to come back and try more of the menu here."}
{"text":"Have been a fan of the Rocky River location for many years, but was hesitant to try the new North Olmsted location due to some of the negative reviews.  I'm happy to report that tonight we tried the North Olmsted location and had an outstanding experience.  Our waiter, Jackson, was very attentive.  The food took just long enough for our family to get a good card game in and have some good family time.  The pizzas we ordered were delicious.  This will be a new favorite spot for us.  This area has been lacking a good eat-in pizza place with good atmosphere.  Happy to have Danny Boys close by."}
{"text":"We first went to this location in October 2016 when it first opened. Service was incredibly slow and food was just \"ok,\" especially in light of the prices. Went back again tonight with the hope the slow service was related to opening week issues. Sadly it wasn't the case. We ordered a small pizza, woogie and kid's shrimp alfredo. We were there nearly two hours by the time we finished our food and paid our bill. Once again the food was just ok. Nothing special. Prices are high. For example the kid's alfredo cost an extra three bucks to have three shrimp added to it. Clearly these must have been very special shrimp as they were not very big. 

Our waitress was not very reliable either. We ordered drinks and proceeded to wait ten minutes for a couple of sodas and a water to show. We watched in awe as she wandered around the dining room in circles while not getting said drinks. We also waited another ten minutes to get our check back after we paid. I would not recommend this place unless you have plenty of time on your hands and enjoy over priced food that's simply ok."}
{"text":"I'm such a fan of this pizza!  First time at the NO location and they are just as amazing as the others.  Tried the tater- tots and sausage and pepper apps this time on the recommendation of our waitress.  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Danny Boy's in River since I was a kid, I was elated to hear that they were expanding to North Olmsted and couldn't wait till they opened. We have been to this location at least a dozen times since it opened and the pizza and pasta is an exact match to the original locations and the servers have been great. Every time we get out of towners in, we rush to this location to share the fantastic food and for them to enjoy true \"DEEP DISH\" Chicago style pizza! 

Until now... We came in on our last day of our holiday vacation on the 26th to end it on a high note with another Chicago Style Pie. We were quickly seated, ordered the normal breadsticks and decided to try the wings. The kids love the breadsticks and ate them quickly and the wings were fantastic with sauce and a nice spice rub on them that stays with you. We ordered our pizza and the kids both got spaghetti and meatballs. The kids were very happy with the pasta as usual and as soon as the pizza arrived we dove right in! I took a bite or two and realized the sausage patty was missing from below the cheese and the toppings we added, we called the waitress over fast and she was surprised that the kitchen \"forgot\" the sausage patty, she apologized and quickly went in back. A moment or so later someone else came to our table to let us know that they have changed the way they make the pizza after almost 26 years just before Christmas and they didn't know why, I feel like it would have been nice to know that they changed it prior to ordering it as that would've given us a heads up to order something else. Thankfully it was just the 4 of us this trip versus bringing someone from out of town to enjoy the pizza we have come to know and love since we were kids."}
{"text":"First off I wanna say to all the people giving 4 stars because of the price, you get what you pay for.   And this place was excellent.   Being from the south, I'm pretty picky on food and it's been tough up here to find good food.   Good job Danny boys.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large cheese pizza, thin crust extra cheese and it was $14 special. $2 thin extra cheese and $2 delivery charge. This crust should be hard..it was floppy. Better off going to Papa John's or Marco's. Taste was good. Well seasoned."}
{"text":"At the time of rating the overall stars were at 3. This feels appropriate for the balance of taste, price, and amount of food. We had meatballs which were good, I just didn't think they were 4-5 star good. My wife had pasta with meat sauce which seemed to be in the similar range as the meatballs. I ordered the Chicago Pie which again was good, but short of the Chicago pizza style. It was very bready with a sweater tasting sausage than a Chicago pizza uses.

The one star drop to a two star is due to service. We were seated for 12 minutes before anyone came to the table. Food came out quickly, but we did not see our waitress again until after our food arrived. There were no drink refills, and twice during our visit we had to find her (once initially to take an order and again to get our check). I wish we had a more attentive server as I could have seen this as a 4-star review under different conditions.

Similar to some other reviews, the live music is a bit loud. Appropriate for the dining experience, but loud enough that we could not have a normal conversation across the table."}
{"text":"Excellent food and quick service. They still seem to be adjusting being a new location to align with their Rocky River location."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I thought it was darn close to the original. Service wasn't nearly as good though. I'll drive a little further & happily wait at the original for good service."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and the d√©cor is really nice! This location has very accessible parking, a nice bar, and the interior has a lot of seating. Unfortunately, the food is just not up to par with the Rocky River location Danny Boys at the moment, but I'm sure that'll change.  The North Olmsted location provided less toppings on pizza and pasta dishes than the River one, at least in my experience and the experience of some coworkers that live in the area. I really want to love DB North Olmsted, I just think it needs a bit of time to find itself. 

UPDATE 1 - Tried the Tater Tots.  They weren't bad, but were similar to tots you'd find at other locations with some tasty flavoring.  Not really a stand-out dish, but was pretty delicious.

UPDATE 2- Ordered the deep dish pepperoni and was kinda disappointed.  Little toppings on our pizza compared to other brands of deep dish pizza.  It was a 90% crust to cheese / sauce / pepperoni pizza.  When I think \"Danny Boys\", I think delicious food stuffed with TONS of toppings.

UPDATE: 3 - Heard a complaint from a coworker about the amount of fillings in his dish that he ordered over the weekend and one of the other people at his table.  Will give it another shot down the road after they've been open a bit.

UPDATE: 4 - Well, decided to give it another run.  Went up there for my grandmother's birthday and decided to head in early to grab a table.  Arrived shortly after 6 PM, waited ~45 minutes for a table and were eventually asked if we would be willing to seat 5 in one of the rounded booths to be seated quicker.  it was a bit crammed, but we were pretty hungry.  (For the record, I do not suggest more than 4 in these booths)  We ordered our food around 7, but didn't receive our pizza until after 8. The manager was kind and apologized for the extended waits, even offering desert and a gift card for a return visit, which was much appreciated by our group. I know our experiences aren't indicative of all customers for this location, but I sensed that carry out customers were placed in priority when compared to the speed of service for seated customers in the restaurant.  Although some of the food is delicious, the consistency has been hit or miss in our case and we will likely choose other locations before ordering from here.  Best of luck to Danny Boys N. Olmsted, but there are other establishments that are quicker, cheaper, and offer similarly tasty pizza.

Update #5: After being asked for my personal information from Danny Boys to send something (I'm guessing a gift card for the frustration with the issues above?) and providing said information, nothing was received. I didn't ask for anything initially, but don't promise a customer that you'll make things right and then drop the ball, twice."}
{"text":"We love Danny Boys and we're so glad to have it open close to us!! Pizza is outstanding and so are the sandwiches.  Try the Rocky Balboa or one of the Stackers.  Staff is always nice and provides great service.  If your looking for a pizza place to go to fogerttttaaaboutit cause you just did, it's Danny Boys fam!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food and atmosphere is wonderful. There's so much on the menu it's hard to decide. Even when you select pizza you won't be disappointed. Don't forget about \"the best breadsticks in the world\" per my son."}
{"text":"So easy to grab a delicious lunch at Danny's - great food, really fast, and great service! Food was even brought out to me while I waited for my carry out order"}
{"text":"Food and service was good.  They had a fat tire promotion going on so we won some free drinks and shirts."}
{"text":"I've had a little bit of everything on the menu so when I say that you can't go wrong with anything on it I know what I am talking about. My favorite by far is the Chicken Philly Pizza! The bread they serve is also outstanding. I usually sit at the bar and the service is always great and the bartenders take good care of you! If you're looking a good pizza place you need to check it out. They have great happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"This was our first time visit. Great dine in experience. Awesome atmosphere, friendly, helpful waitress and out of this world food.  Our table Had both pasta and pizza.  Recommend the California and the Chicago pizza and the stoplight pastas.  Dinners come with large salads and 'to die for'' rolls. We will be back"}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time. We as well as my family have always gone to the River location, and its a hit. 
  We had an overall good time, we came with family. Most of us are vegatarin so we got the family size build your own veggie, it was spot on, the selection of alcohol is amazing. The salads were awesome as well. 
  We prefer split checks makes it easier, for all. But, because of a coupon issue could not split the check, that is my only draw back. Other than that this a good locale for the area, im sure I'll be back, especially when the Windians hit the playoffs."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in last Saturday and this place was packed. We didn't want to wait 45 min so we grabbed a seat at the bar. We had dinner and drinks at the bar and everything was wonderful. Almost a week later I come back with a few friends. We were sat immediately @ 5:45. The place was about 3/4 full when we placed our order. We didn't get our food until 6:55. Totally unacceptable. We barely even got an apology and I thought at least some sort of discount would be on the bill. Nope, nada. I know it's a new location but I had no issues my first visit. Guess they are batting .500. I can't give it two and a half stars so it gets just two for this trip."}
{"text":"Didn't realize Danny Boys had opened a restaurant in North Olmsted. We have been to the restaurant in Rocky River a few times but don't go more often because of the drive, parking and its size. But, the food and service are so great every once in a while it is worth the inconvenience. We thought if the food and service was as great as Rocky River it would be a place to go often. So, on a Friday night we decided to try it out getting there about 5:30 finding plenty of parking and pleasantly surprised as to how large the restaurant was compared to Rocky River. We were seated immediately and our waitress was prompt and very pleasant. Except for slight glitch in our order the food was spectacular and met all of our expectations. 
HOWEVER, it was so darn loud you couldn't think or have a conversation with anyone at the table or the waitress which probably was the cause for the glitch in the order. 
Why can't anyone provide a quiet restaurant where you can enjoy your meal and the people you are with.
As much as we love Danny Boys the chance of returning soon is highly unlikely and if we do it might be lunch when it also might be quieter. 
WHAT A SHAME!"}
{"text":"First time and Danny boy's. Was in the mood for local pizza, was not disappointed. Noe took great care of us.
Had the Chicago pizza it was very good. We definitely will return to try the pasta.
Great mix of music to enjoy a glass of wine, beer or cocktails."}
{"text":"Yeah, pretty much not going to this place again.  We went a few weeks ago for the first time on a Sunday evening after a meeting around 9pm (they close at 10pm), to just get a couple of beers and a pizza.  First, the place was dead.  Maybe 6 people total in the joint. We walk in and was greeted by this strange guy (who looked like a server who works there,) that kind of just looked at us oddly. It looked like he was phasing out.  We seemed to have relieved the tension of him wanting to leave for the evening, by telling him we will be sitting up at the bar. Sit at the bar and it wasn't greeted at all pretty much.  It was a very cold atmosphere.  After this, we knew we were going to get crap service, as it appeared that they just wanted to close up because it was so dead. Being in the industry, I recognized it and we should have just left. We didn't...unfortunately.  We get our beers, order an app and a pizza at the same time.  The app was fine, but the pizza didn't come out as ordered. When it came out, I mentioned to the bartender that it doesn't look like this is the pizza we ordered, and it looks like a plain cheese pizza.  She tells us that the toppings are \"most likely\" under the cheese.  Now..I would hope if you are working at a pizza joint, that you would know where pepperoni and ricotta cheese is placed on a pizza. Sure enough, we bite into it, and whadda know..it's a plain cheese pizza.  We tell the bartender about it, and she asks us if we want them to make another.  It's like 9:40pm at this time...like we would have them make us another pizza with the weird behaviors and lack of service we were getting that night. Take the dumb thing off of our check!  No, instead, they charge us for a plain cheese pizza. The manager who was AT the bar hanging out with friends was approached by the bartender and she gives us this look like we are crashing her party at the bar, and adjusts the check.  This whole thing was very strange to me.  We have 3 beers each, a pizza we didn't order, and an app that was just ok...for 60 bucks.  Then tipped this chick another 10 bucks on top of that (yes..my mistake)...so, again, 70 bucks for crap service, food we didn't order, and a couple of ok beers.  Nope..never again.  I have never provided a yelp review of any restaurant, especially after a first visit, but come ON!  Get it together Danny Boys!"}
{"text":"Absolutely overpriced!!! The pizza is nothing but dough and usually undercooked. The entire place is overrated!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to this place and I was impressed! 

We got sat very quickly and the service was great. They have great options in their menu- pizzas, pastas, calzones and salads, etc! I went with my family and we each got the house salad and we split 2 small pizzas! They offer a variety of different sizes and styles of pizza!!! (Yes please!) We got the original margarita pizza and the \"social\" clevelander pizza. SO GOOD :) 
They also have a draft list &plenty of TVs to watch games.

I am so happy this place is in my hometown. Planning on coming back!"}
{"text":"I came in for a quick dinner one evening - before a drive to Toledo. #TeamMCPc was having it's Cancer fundraiser. So I came by to participate. Sat at the bar and ordered a bowl of the White Chicken Chili.

I asked for hot sauce - something besides Tabasco sauce. They have a house made hot wing sauce - the bartender brought me some of that! Outstanding! Mouth watering! I used most of it in the soup! I could take shots of that - it was so good! And of course the White Chicken Chili was tasty - even more so with that amazing, spicy sauce!

#DannyBoysPizza"}
{"text":"Ok so I needed to go see what the hype was about this place. The food is amazing! The price is why it got 4 stars. Just a bit too much to be honest. So to get to the food. We got a pizza and I got a chicken California sammich. Holy cow was that chicken and food amazing! The pizza was just the right amount of cheese sauce and toppings. The dough wasn't soggy and didn't flop over like some do. The sammich was so good. It had guacamole on it. I didn't get to taste much of the guacamole because the person that ordered for me didn't tell them no lettuce so I had to scrape it off. The chicken wasn't tough and was so moist. We did a to go order which was nice and convenient. I did see the place was clean, enough staff to take care of everyone and the table I sat at to wait was clean and not sticky. Also fluffy people friendly for those that are looking for places to go. Music was nice and not too loud to where you can't have a nice conversation with whom your with. Overall it was  a nice experience. I wouldn't mind going back. But I definitely wouldn't go back as a regular because of the prices.
EDIT: what u see pictured is what was ordered! A pizza and a sandwich. Spent $40"}
{"text":"ended up here by accident .. had Frankie's on Great Northern Blvd (our normal go to for pizza when in the area) not had a 45 minute wait we may not have stumbled upon this joint .. had eaten at the RR location in the past .. opted for the deep dish pizza & it did not disappoint & the cannoli dessert was delish as well .. we will be back .. happening upon this place as we did was a happy accident indeed .. oh btw .. service was also excellent .. cannot forget about that .. !"}
{"text":"I really really like Danny Boy's!  It's quite close to my residence, the quality food is tasty good, and the servers are competent and personable. The retro Sinatra & music of yesteryear decor is just FANTASTIC, and brings you back to a great American era of top notch music and entertainment!  When I walk in here, I can almost still hear my dad playing his old Sinatra records on his classic FISHER 500C tubed receiver, filling our house with timeless music back in the 60's and 70's!  I absolutely love their woogie, pizza, and fettucine alfredo.  I bring 'the girls' here all the time.  My only mini-gripe is that some of the booths are not that comfortable at all.  My feet seem to hang over this elevated area just underneath, and I just barely fit when I sit down (no, i'm not 'chunky').  Bad design and execution, but 'small potatoes really.  I will continue to come here, as i've had nothing but good experiences.

My only wish is that they follow the example of Frankie's Italian Restaurant down the road, and institute a half-price pizza night special on a weekday.  Lately, we've been going to Frankie's a lot on Tuesdays precisely because of this.  I think this would be a way for Danny Boy's to attract some new business, as well as a thank you nod to their regulars who want to catch a break every now and then.  My opinion is that the half-price pizza would be sort of a 'loss leader', but they could still make a profit on appetizers, drinks, desserts, etc.  Just a thought."}
{"text":"My daughter & I went today because we wanted to try the Chicago style pizza. This was my first trip ever to Danny Boys. The food was delicious. The servers were super friendly. We will definitely be back again! Recommend to all."}
{"text":"I had the taco food over.  They forgot to spice the meat.  The dough was great but the tomato slices were hard.

My son got the mac Nd cheese pizza.  He said it was great.  

Once the waitress took our order, we didn't see her again until she brought our food out."}
