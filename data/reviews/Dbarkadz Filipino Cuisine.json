{"text":"Found this place using yelp and this place is amazing!  We had the fried chicken and rice for lunch.  Best fried chicken, so tasty! They give you tons of food, a heaping plateful of lightly fried rice.  We could have actually split one plate between the two of us.  You get a lot for your money. And it's not like they ask much for what you're getting. $7.99 for one meal."}
{"text":"Been going in this place since they opened, and its always been a treat! Great Food, Good Prices, and really friendly hospitable staff!!! A great filipino food place!!!!!!!! Never had any bad experience. They also cook pancit, spaghetti as you order it, always fresh. They also have halo halo!!!!!! Will definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Meal: Kare-Kare and Dinuguan with rice and complimentary bulalo soup for $7.99

Friendly staff, large size portions, and prices were very good. Food was delicious! Recommend the dinuguan. The kare-kare was good but wished they offered the shrimp sauce. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Been to other Filipino restaurants for the kamayan feast but this place is my favourite! 

The staff are SO friendly! It feels like you're at a house party. 

The food is so good..!!! Favourites: crispy pork, snapper, chicken skewer, and the noodles  

It's also amazing how it's almost sketchy when going to our table because it was at the back and in the basement of the place. 

Will 1000% go back."}
{"text":"This is a great place. On one side you can buy a bunch of Filipino-style snacks, and on the other there are several different classic Filipino food items. I particularly like their pork skewers (fatty, flavourful, wonderful), the deep fried pork belly, and their fragrant garlic fried rice. There's also a peanut sauce chicken (kare kare I think?) that's great, and their Halo halo is wonderful.

Highly recommend this place for a quick lunch, or if you've got a lot of appetite call in advance and ask for Kamayan ($15 per person).

EDIT: The person below me when sorted chronologically apparently has no tastebuds since they can't taste the onion and tomato infused into the baked fish, or the deep fried light saltiness from the other fish, and has completely ignored A) the side samplers they give you and B) the plethora of sauces that are all clearly labelled on the side of the restaurant lol."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars. We came here for a Kamayan Feast on Friday. After the heavy traffic on the road, I felt car sick. So I didn't have much of an appetite. But as I started picking at the stuffed fish, I ate more and more. On the leaf, there were two types of fish. Butter fish and a red snapper, the red snapper was stuffed with onions, ginger and carrot. The calamari was stuffed with rice. So tasty, I had left overs so I took them home and reheat in the oven, even after three days, it tasted so good. I've added $3 so that I can have both the pancit (fried thin vermicelli and the palabok which is a thick rice noodle -also pronounced as Lai Fun in Chinese. One of my favourite noodles) 
There was also a pile of garlic rice. We ended up packing 4 boxes home. It's only  $15 per person. You must make reservations ahead of time, no drop in for Kamayan feast. Will be back and bringing my friends to this one!"}
{"text":"Great food at a really good value ($15 each). Be hungry when you get there. Meal will have noodles, rice, 2 types of fish, fried squid, pork skewer, fried pork belly, mango, and choice of sides. Comes with bottled water.

For large groups, recommend reserving ahead so they are prepared for you.

Funky little place as has mix of take out stand, grocery store, and restaurant features."}
{"text":"Had paksiw bangus on Sat to go and was ok .. I like it more sour .. their tortang talong were huge and tasty with the onions"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time for a late lunch on Sunday at 2:30pm. It was pretty busy at this time! There was a good selection of food but we opted for the adobo, beef steak and sweet & sour fish. Served with a mountain of white rice. Very generous with food portions and a bit cheaper in price than other Filipino restaurants. All dishes we had were really good and satisfying! Atmosphere could use a little work but is very authentic and typical of the stores in the Philippines. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Boodle Fight? I've heard of Kamayan Feast. Apparently, according to Google, this is a Filipino military tradition where the food is laid out on banana leaves across the table and diners eat with their hands. It's definitely communal dining. Kamayan, Filipino for \"eating with the hands\", is the same thing but maybe sounds more civilized. That's my understanding. Correct?

JK came across an offer for a Boodle date (two adults for $30). Having missed a few invitations for Kamayan, I was anxious to try this so we made a reservation for lunch.

We arrived at Dbarkadz all of their tables were occupied. Hmmm. There were only four tables near the front of the place, near the door. The rest of the space was set up like a store, with a service counter and steam table towards the back. Where were we going to sit.

The proprieters realised that we were there for a reservation and invited us to sit in their basement dining room. It looks like they host larger groups down there, and karaoke parties. We had the entire space to ourselves for our \"date\".

The food was presented on banana leaves laid out on a full-sized (large) sheet pan. Wow! Impressive looking! Hmmm, that's a lot of food. How are we going to finish this? Anyway, first things first, pictures! The overall presentation was impressive but there were so many components that deserved some attention of their own.

Pictures out of the way, we gloved up and dug in. There was fish (tilapia and milkfish), rice, noodles, mango, cuttlefish, eggplant, bitter melon, chicken, several pork dishes, and more!

I'm not a huge fan of fish, especially tilapia, and I've never had milkfish. They were stuffed with onions and tomatoes and grilled. Not bad. The cuttlefish was battered and fried, also not bad. The noodles, curry chicken and bitter melon were good. The pork dishes were our favourite, especially the crispy skin and the BBQ skewers. Yummy!

There was no way we were going to finish this food. It was too much! JK packed a takeout box and there was still enough left on the tray for another meal. We enjoyed the food and the experience. The staff (Owners? Managers?) were very friendly.  At $15/person, it's a great value! Make sure you come hungry!"}
{"text":"Very good food, good service and clean place. Thats how it should be. I would recommend their Chicken fried rice and breakfast meals. Pork and chicken bbq is a must."}
{"text":"Looking for something nice and quick ! 
And this place is perfect. A lot of variety of Filipino food, people who work there are so nice. 
I will definitely come back if I am around the area again. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Ordered:

Palabok ($7.99)
Tosilog ($7.99)
Chicken fried rice ($7.99)
Lechon kawali ($7)

Food selection abundant.
Short orders all at $7.99.

Drinks not included.

Taste was pretty good."}
{"text":"Every time I buy food here its always bad. Like its smells bad and taste sour. It's been 5 times in a row their food is consistently disgusting. I wont recommend this for everyone. They're cheap that they save their food from previous day and serve it the next day. It's like they dont care if you get sick from their food."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp, my friends and I decided to try the famous Philippine \"Boodle Fight\" at Dbarkadz.  Although the service was decent, we were thoroughly disappointed with the quality of food.  The fish were bland (no salt and no taste).  

The only good thing I have to say is that the price is cheap...$15 per person.  

All in all, it is an interesting experience with very disappointing food."}
{"text":"If you're craving for some yummy Filipino food then you have to check this place out.  They also do boodle fight. Price is pretty reasonable, portions are big and food is tasty.  Plus the staff are super friendly and such jokers which makes you feel like your at a Filipino house party."}
{"text":"Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fight (aka eating food with your bare hands over banana leaves with an array of filipino seafood, rice, meats) here is a MUST!

From what I saw, you can order regular food/other items upstairs but the banana leaf feasting happens in the basement. The feast is laid out for you so you get to eat with your eyes before even touching the food. The meal is SO beautiful to look at considering the variety and accompanying colours. They provide gloves but the full experience comes from just eating with your hands (this also means everyone has to stay off their phones!). Even though I dislike having dirty hands I had so much fun doing this! There really is something about having all the food laid out in front of you and eating it with your fingers. The food was tasty but I can't say I really loved it - a solid 3/5 for me. BUT the experience and staff more than made up for what was lacking in food (+1, maybe even 2 stars). The basement isn't particularly fancy but the staff were incredibly kind and helpful. They also have a karaoke machine that anyone can use - and use they do! 

Dbarkadz means \"friends\" in Filipino and this place definitely embodies that word. Despite the mediocre food, we all had a BLAST here. Plus, the price of $15/person is great with the massive amounts of food you get (you can take leftovers home!). 10/10 would come again with a group of friends/family for a Boodle Fight!"}
