{"text":"The bagels here are imported not made on location. This results in an almost stale and very chewy bagel. They are shipped from up north then repurposed. We have given them multiple tries hoping for different results. The staff is friendly and welcoming if only their food was as appeasing. My recommendation is if you're looking for a true NY style bagel go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have Stopped in mid mornings a few times very good spot for coffee & bagel pleasant atmosphere friendly people new to area miss my Jersey spots but this is best so far"}
{"text":"I'm from NJ so finding a place in the South that serves Taylor Ham (pork roll) is rare. Great bagel and now I'll cone t back when I'm craving Taylor Ham."}
{"text":"Another exceptionally yummy everything bagel topped with their hand made green olive cream cheese. Great with their Charleston tea plantation cinnamon spice tea. Can Friday get any better!"}
{"text":"Some of the best bagels I've had and the owner was nice enough to bake some fresh everything bagels as the were out. Good coffee too! Glad to find a good place for bagels so close to home."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast! They renovated an old bank and it has rooms with couches if you want a bit more privacy while you eat. The chains are all giant open spaces with a sterile corporate feel. This feels like home. Free coffee refills. Big NY bagels. Breakfast sandwiches. Pastries. Soft serve ice cream for afternoon treat too. Great prices. Support local small businesses, especially this one."}
{"text":"Great bagels, cream cheese and coffee..wonderful people..owner and his son lead by example..love it..."}
{"text":"My son said it was the best bagel breakfast sandwich he has ever had!!! Owner served us. So very friendly.  Great customer service and excellent food.  We both had the Taylor ham egg and cheese on everything bagel. Next time we are here we will most definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The bagels are really good and the frozen custard is too. The best part, though, is the owner. He is wonderful, cheerful, patient, and has set up a whole area just for kids with games, kid chairs, and books, so the whole family can enjoy. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Coffee is not good.  Bagels are ok...not great by far.  The owner was cheerful but he put a lot of money into digital mocha machine, really fancy but didn't focus on the house brew which I consider to be the cornerstone of a breakfast place.  The bagels are not made at the bagel boat they are brought in from somewhere.  I'm not sure those bagels were boiled.

The place is quaint and quite frankly seems to be trying to find its identity.  It serves everything from bagels to soups to frozen custards...

The frozen custard was from a mix not from natural ingredients.  It was more like a soft serve where bags of ingredients are dumped in a machine.  The chocolate had little flavor and wasn't smooth and creamy."}
{"text":"I love this place, people are friendly and the service is grate. The owner is very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Love the Bagel Boat! Frank and his staff are great and are genuinely happy to see you each time you come in. Try the gelato, it's unbelievable!!

{"text":"Best bagels anywhere close to lake Wylie. They also have great soft serve for a great ice cream treat for later in the day. My wife and I always get a lox and bagel which is on point."}
{"text":"This place is our special treat on Saturday mornings. The best service and fabulous food. It's hard to find good bagels. My favorite is the everything wheat bagel egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich with the inside of the bagel scooped out. They also have ice cream, lunch items, and desserts. Grab lunch to go and picnic at McDowell Nature Preserve."}
{"text":"Large selection of bagels. Very fresh. Love the veggie bagel lightly toasted with bacon , egg & cheese. Generous portions of everything. Made good use of an old bank. I like what they have done. Owner very friendly."}
{"text":"Finally!  Fabulous bagels and coffee in Lake Wylie!

I'm giving 5 stars for the absolute best bagels I've had outside of NY State, as well as yummy cappuccino and super-friendly and fast service (they even have a drive-thru!).  And the prices are very reasonable, considering the quality of their product.

They also offer different delicious pastries and other sweets daily (which I'm embarrassed to admit, I've tried too many), as well as frozen yogurt.

I would go out of my way for their bagels and coffee, but I'm glad I don't have to."}
{"text":"Good bagels and service is friendly. I like to order extra bagels to keep on hand at home"}
{"text":"We got a dozen bagels for $14 which included jalape√±o, onion, sesame, Asiago, plain, and everything bagels. Just tried the Asiago with their lox and it was delicious! 

They were open today (new year's) and satisfied our bagel craving. We will definitely be back and will try their other selection of food next time."}
{"text":"The closest to NY style bagels in the area. The fresh lox on bagel never disappoint. Very friendly atmosphere with great customer service."}
{"text":"Best espresso milkake! Gave the puppy a dog treat, and always love supporting veterans, especially vietnam vets. My father was given a welcome home by the co-owner, he always appreciates the sentiment! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Bagels are good, selection is good, restaurant is clean, and the waitstaff is friendly.  On the downside: prices are too high; above what comparable CLT area bagel places charge.  Recently, my Mother In Law bought us bagels, and was charged an additional .25 or .50 cents (don't remember which), per bagel, for extra butter.  Fortunately for me, the bagels had little butter...good for me, because I don't like heavily buttered bagels.

It isn't that my Wife & I, or our families, don't have the money; we do.  But every time we frequent the bagelry, we feel like we're getting nickle-and-dimed.

I'm sure different a pricing strategy (e.g. not charging extra for butter, offering a baker's dozen, offering minor condiments at little or no cost), would drive in many more people.

This bagelry has a lot going for it.  Perhaps they could do more \"in house,\" to bring down retail prices."}
{"text":"Great place!! Delicious bagels, frozen yogurt and coffee.  The friendly staff and atmosphere are so inviting.  Nice music with a wider variety of sitting areas and options.  I have one place I sit to work at my computer.  One place for reading. Another for meeting with a friend and they even have a small room for a private conversation or group meeting.  I live in Charlotte, but it is right over the bridge - easy."}
{"text":"Yummy Bagels ! Wonderful employees that know their menu inside and out - smoothies to write home about !  Awesome place to network with a fabulous cup of java .   Oh and soup and sandwich has  fresh everything ! 
Just might have to go tomorrow for a bag of assorted good stuff ! And the CREAM CHEESE HOLY MOLY !  Try the mom & pop  bagel shop and support our Locals ! 
Here's to Bagel Boat !"}
{"text":"Super cute place!!  You must stop and visit.  Soft serve gelato, coffee, and bagels.  Sit under the tree outside on picnic bench or inside in cute little rooms.   This building was a bank.   The safe is still there"}
{"text":"Since this joint is called the Bagel Boat let's talk about the bagels first... they are the best I've had since leaving Jersey many years ago. The texture is heavenly, just the right amount of chew to your bite and nicely crisp skin on the outside. You can tell they are made fresh in house. The creamy cheese is nice and thick and the perfect texture to compliment the bagel. 

In addition they have great coffee, everything from drip to a vanilla latte (which the daughter had and it passed the test for tastebuds). There's little nooks and crannies all over for seating and even a kid section with toys and games (even games for the young at heart to enjoy). They sell Krispy Kreme donuts and ice cream as well as lunch sandwiches. There's even a little gift shop area. Be sure to stop in when you're in the Lake Wylie area next time."}
{"text":"Wonderful, hospitable place! Very fresh, great tasting food! Would definitely recommend to anyone coming through the area!"}
{"text":"FINALLY a great bagel in the south!  We lived for 12 years in South Carolina and moved to Charlotte last year.  We have been on a search for the best bagel in the south and finally found it at the Bagel Boat.  

My husband and I travel from Concord on Saturday mornings just for these delish bagels.  It is so appreciated to get a scrumptious bagel with a very generous amount of flavored cream cheese spread for such a reasonable price.  The great coffee and super friendly service makes a wonderful start to any day.  

Tomorrow is Saturday - can't wait to wake up and head to the Bagel Boat tomorrow morning!"}
{"text":"Solid Bagel spot. Good variety of bagels, and my husband and I both really enjoyed our Ruben and Roast Beef sandwiches. Oreo milkshake also deserves a thumbs up. I'll think we'll be frequenting the location quite a bit in the future. 

The only thing missing on this menu is a good Italian sub. The bagels get brought in from NYC - bring the Italian sub with it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I here go to this place on a regular basis. It is convenient on the way to or from Charlotte. I love the Everything bagel the best, but the Cinnamon Raisin is also a good choice. When we go, we always bring home some extras to have over the weekend. The trick, is to put them in a heavy freezer bag, squeeze out the air, and put them in the freezer. Then heat them up with a bagel toaster. The owner is very friendly, and will talk, and talk, and talk if there is no one else around. I like both the breakfast and the lunch options, as well as the coffee. Make sure, if you are taking them home, that you ask to get the bagels sliced, otherwise they will not do it."}
{"text":"I love Frank and the crew at Bagel Boat! The atmosphere is great - it's an awesome place to hang out, get some work done, network and most importantly, EAT! The bagels are New York style and made fresh daily and they even make their own cream cheese schmears! They serve breakfast, lunch & have wonderful ice cream too. 

Bagel Boat is exactly what a neighborhood restaurant/coffee shop should be & more! I would go every day if my diet allowed!"}
{"text":"Super yummy bagel spot. Family owned and operated. I stop by whenever I'm in town! I love their sesame bagels the best."}
{"text":"Always on point with bagels and sammies.  Love the breakfast sandwiches and great coffee.  Great service"}
{"text":"I also don't get this place.  A lot of good reviews but the bagels are terrible and overpriced.  The bacon egg and cheese on a bagel has microwaved frozen egg disc and rubbery microwaved bacon.  Also, salt bagel is just a bagel with course table salt sprinkled over it, not the nice chunky, white salt that you usually get on a soft pretzel like NY bagels.  The everything bagel is also terrible with oats plastered all over it!!. Why?  Don't bother.  Bagel Boat.  More like Bagel Joke!"}
{"text":"Great place for coffee and frozen custard, yes frozen custard.  If you liked Stricklands you will love this place.  After reading other reviews we're excited to try their bagels also.  Great owner as well.  Support this local business. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped at Bagel Boat for breakfast and I'm glad I did! Food and coffee was GREAT! I got a sausage egg and cheese on an everything bagel with a coffee to accompany. The service was top notch. Louis greeted us upon entering and took our order efficiently and got our food to us super quick. Next time I'm in town will make sure I stop in again!"}
{"text":"This place use to be great!! I went in for a bagel last weekend and it was such a disappointment. I have had better bagels at Harris teeter. Sad because I swear I've been there before when the bagels tasted like they were made there? Maybe I just came on a bad day. 
This area desperately needs a good bagel place where bagels are made in house daily."}
{"text":"Good little place! Bagels are best first thing when they open, just a tip. :) Coffee is really good! Workers are generally really nice. Frozen yogurt wasn't my favorite. Didn't have much flavor, owner mentioned he was trying out a new recipe and wanted some feedback, maybe I'll try it another day if he switched back to the old recipe. 
Stop in a try out a sandwich or bagel or coffee one day!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got a lox bagel for $9 and a soft serve ice cream for $3.5. The bagel was awesome, came with cream cheese, generous helping of smoked salmon, capers, tomatoes, and onions. 

The bagel seemed a little under cooked, also it was not toasted like I asked for it to be. I think this might have just been a preparation error so I would like to go again and get another one to see. Everything was great, definitely worth the price. 

The ice cream cone was ok, had a kinda whipped texture and was a lot sweeter than other soft serves I have had. nothing special and I don't think it was worth the price. 

I definitely want to come back and try the pastrami and other sandwiches. It's very exciting to see a NY style deli in Charlotte. They also have a very strong small business vibe and everyone seems very friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's such a cute little spot! The staff is sweet, but I mean they're kids. They do try their best though. I live up the street, and come often. The bagels are great, but if I were you I'd avoid the breakfast rolls. Their dessert is awesome, and I always grab a slice of carrot cake when they have it. My only gripe is how expensive a bagel with lox is. If you're a fan of lox, just buy them at public up the street. It costs $9 for a bagel with lox, my local breakfast deli in NY sold 'em for $5."}
{"text":"I love bagel boat. The only place I've found that has pumpkin spice coffee year round. They also have these amazing black and white cookies-- I guess those are a big seller up north."}
{"text":"Terrific!  Did I just teleport to New Jersey?? Most mornings all I want is a bagel with taylor ham..thank you Bagel Boat for making all my breakfast dreams come true.  And you have a drive thru!! I'm crying sesame seeds of food joy right now."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this local spot! I have ONLY had the bagels here so far (and their cream cheese), and they are SO GOOD!! We always make sure we get plenty to take home and freeze.
The customer service is always so friendly and helpful. We definitely plan on stopping here for sandwiches or more in the future. So happy to have a spot like this that is local!!"}
{"text":"We adore the Bagel Boat.  The owner is one of the best things about this place.  .  He is so personable, greets everyone he can, remembers people and seems to actually care about having a conversation with you.  They are always very concerned with the length of the drive-thru line and do everything they can to help serve people faster.  I stop here a lot, lol.  Usually we go for breakfast, haven't really tried anything else, except the chocolate and vanilla custard ice cream cones.  They are fab, get one some day.  Bagels are cooked fresh, everything is always great quality.  The menu could use a little tweaking, which is the only reason I took away 1 star.  Taylor ham (awesome that they have it!) tastes microwaved (I'm sure to save time), but it's still worth it.  . Quiche is served cold, which was quite a surprise to me one day (lol).  Didn't order that again, but it could have been a mistake.  Hot chai latte is yummy, much prefer it to the iced version.  The private rooms are great, as is the place for little kids.  Did I mention what a sweetheart the owner is?  That alone would keep me coming back.  Happy to support them!"}
{"text":"Excellent bagels and great small town feel.. Love the sandwiches.. Great prices. I love to start my day off with a coffee and a bagel sandwich!!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and wanted to try it out, since it has great reviews. We will say it was ok. Not terrible, not great, somewhere in between. The prices are ridiculous, and we are used to high California prices. We got 6 bagels, with no topping, two coffees and a small container of cream cheese and it was $30. The bagels were ok, not any better than Thomas brand you buy in the stores. The French toast one had little flavor, pumpernickel was ok, but we didn't like the seeds in it and the kids thought the blueberry wasn't great. The cream cheese tasted like Philadelphia brand, so again nothing special. The vanilla latte tasted like a sugary hot chocolate packet that they just added hot water to. They had sandwiches and ice cream that we didn't try, since we went for breakfast. Again the prices seemed really high on those items too. Maybe they're the best sandwiches ever? The staff was nice but not super friendly, and it took a bit to have some serve us. We probably won't be back for breakfast. Save your money and buy a pack of Thomas bagels and store bought cream cheese for less than half the price."}
{"text":"Since I moved to SC this has been one of my fave breakfast places to go they are super friendly and have the bomb bagels asiago cheese bagel is yummy! Coffee is fresh and you can't beat the prices for sure if your in the area you should stop by!"}
{"text":"I just moved down here from Jersey and all I wanted was a good bagel for breakfast - I definitely found it here. Good cream cheese as well. Reminds me of home! Next time I will be trying the pork roll, egg, and cheese! Staff is very nice too."}
{"text":"Quality bagels shipped from Queens NY. Eggs made to order upon request. Bacon, scrambled egg and cheese on an everything bagel is my great. Though, you cannot beat their FRESH LOX bagel. Bagel reminds me of home."}
{"text":"Very nice business, clean establishment and the bagels are amazing. Coffee well brewed and much better than we've had anywhere else."}
{"text":"Very good bagel sandwiches, made to order.  I got the sausage and egg, and liked it better than Einstein Bros."}
{"text":"If you want to support a local business, you won't get more local than Bagel Boat. And what's not to love about hand-made coffee drinks, fresh froyo/custard and tasty bagels?

I popped in for a bagel and some wifi and stuck around to watch the traffic flow. Nice little spot with several high and low tables as well as little \"offices\" off to the side. Well, it looks like it used to be a bank so that's just awesome. My everything bagel with salmon cream cheese was excellent. Super cool the way the guy showed it to me after its pass through the toaster to ask if I wanted it to go through again!

The building is at the front of the plaza, directly facing the road."}
{"text":"Let me start that I am from Jersey and my parents own a bagel store. This makes me very picky about the bagels I eat. My husband has been telling me about this place since he has meetings here. This morning we decided to stop for breakfast before I went to work. The place is very clean and the staff is polite but not overly friendly or happy. They were just awake for their early sat morning shift, which I don't blame them.  I placed a simple order - plain bagel toasted with cream cheese.   When I got to work my bagel was cold and it was never toasted.  I know this is a minor thing to write a review on but for me it makes or breaks my breakfast. I was really excited for my breakfast and I was so disappointed I had to eat a cold untoasted bagel.  They were not busy, they just decided not to take my full order which included to toast my bagel.  I am not holding this against them and I do plan to go there again - but I hope the store reads the review and talk to their staff about making an order the way the customer wants it."}
{"text":"I start my day here as often as possible.  Great food and excellent customer service.  They always treat you with respect and service is quick.  Even when they are busy they get you out the door in minutes!  Highly recommend this as a breakfast or lunch spot.  Now that they have teamed up with Bush and Vine produce stand you can get fresh salads too.  Office catering is made easy.  They deliver to the office.custom Coffees and smoothies are great too. Finish your lunch or day with an ice cream sundae."}
{"text":"Although I only get to visit Bagel Boat but a couple times a year, it is one of the highlights of my trips to Lake Wylie. The food is consistently top notch and the owner, Frank, always takes time to make you feel welcome. There are too many great food options to recommend just one but, as a traditionalist, I love a bagel (I go with onion) with cream cheese, lox, capers and a slice of tomato. It doesn't get any better than that. And the coffee, cold or hot, is outstanding."}
{"text":"Love the service love the food. It's like walking into a real family cafe. Always greeted with a smile and always willing to help. Love the bagles and the new Italian pastries. I give them 5 stars over all...service, cleanliness and food."}
{"text":"These are actually NY bagels shipped from NY. I give 4 stars cause if I was in NY it would be my fav bagel and they seem to skip a little on the toppings. Overall great place and will be back."}
{"text":"The reviews brought us to this place.  At arrival, I liked the look and feel of the place and we were hopeful of getting great tasting bagels and bagel breakfast sandwiches.  In short, the bagels were not 'alive'.  The texture was off and the actual flavor was just ok.  My review is based on other bagels I have tried here in Charlotte (Poppy's) and in nyc where I spent the first 25 years of my life.  I wish this place had great bagels because we live in the area and have nothing similar close by. :("}
{"text":"Okay, so with the advice of Bagel Boat's owner, Frank, we have discovered the key to a perfectly toasted bagel (at least for our preference).....the key is asking for it to be double toasted! We haven't had any issues since we started asking for double toasted and Bagel Boat has become a regular Sunday stop for breakfast. Favorite bagels have been the whole wheat everything, classic plain, and as of today, onion is definitely on the list. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Good coffee. Friendly people. Good service. Nice bagel sandwich.  definitely NY style/quality bagels. I got the Taylor ham and Egg sandwich this morning. It's A HEAVY sandwich! like holding a softball heavy...this aint no McSandwich you're getting.  You wont be disappointed if you find yourself yearning for a NY Bagel and you come here. I promise you will be happy."}
{"text":"Great local spot for fresh bagels and good coffee. They also serve lunch and treats as well. This morning I got an everything bagel with just egg and bacon (I would have loved an everything wheat bagel but they were out though not a big deal). The service was friendly (as it always is) and fast. The breakfast sandwich was delicious and brought to my seat with a smile. My favorite coffee here is the southern pecan, and it is always consistent and tasty. Enjoy having such a great spot here in Lake Wylie!"}
{"text":"KILLER bagels and bagel sandwiches. Great place for breakfast, good coffee, abundant seating and much more. Don't drive by it, easy to miss. 

The staff was great. This was our first time ordering and we screwed up our order but the staff took care of us and didn't make us pay extra. Instead, we put some money in the donation buckets at the register.

We will be back."}
{"text":"New to area and wanted a nice brew.    I decided to try the SMALL coffee.   $2.45 for small lukewarm coffee clearly brewed earlier in the day.  Sorry but disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome bagel place in LW. Everything is fresh, service is fast and wonderful, and it's delicious. I love this place."}
{"text":"Great little bagel shop. I was looking for an authentic NY bagel after I moved to the Steele Creek area. When my cable guy picked up on my accent, he told me about this little gem. A 10 min drive away and I was treated to a good schmear! They also have rainbow cookies and black and white cookies.  Good coffee, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly staff, great bagels, and coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Just continues to exude excellence in every way possible. Customer Service is on believable! If you have not made it to Bagel Boat as yet? You must go. Frank the owner will be glad to chat with you and make your day better."}
{"text":"Great place for a morning coffee. Owners are nice and very friendly!! You are guaranteed to see them working hard behind the counter to serve you the best!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a bagel breakfast sandwhich on the run. I got the asiago bagel with bacon, egg and cheese. I don't know what it is about a cooked egg thats not scrambled that I love but it made this bagel sandwhich. It complemented my cappuccino well. There was plenty of seating area and seemed like a great place to bring your family for a quick bite. I need to come back to try there gelato or froyo."}
{"text":"Friendly service, delicious coffee, and very generous with the cream cheese. 

I haven't tried anything else here but they have some yummy looking desserts and ice cream."}
{"text":"Ok for a REAL NY bagels you need to stop here!  This quaint little place. The bagels are amazingly soft and not stale as some places I've tried down here since I moved from NY. 
Not sure on how many bagels they make a day etc but my next pass through I will definitely try the pastrami and soft ice cream. 
This reminds me of when I used to travel up to Rochester, NY for ice cream"}
{"text":"I've been off work and thus taking my 2 daughters to school this week. We've been stopping for breakfast on the way, first Dunkin Donuts (Rock Hill), then chic-fil-a (Rivergate) twice Today, to end an argument, I told them we were going to a new place, the Bagel Boat. Found via courtesy of Yelp! We all thought the place was very cool. First, I really like the home grown places, if they are good, because they just have more character than the mass market chain stores. This place has loads of character and excellent food. The bagels were top notch. We all got the bagel sandwich, egg, with your favorite meat (bacon, ham, sausage). The staff were super friendly, and the service was very fast. They also have shakes, smoothies, frozen yogurt, but we saved that for one day after school. All in all, a great little establishment. I have a new fav place to eat a quick breakfast in Lake Wylie. If you are in the Rivergate area, take the 5 minutes to drive down south 49, just across the lake, and upgrade your standard quick breakfast fare at the Bagel Boat."}
{"text":"We're Sunday regulars!  I also enjoy drive-thru on my way to work.  Bagels are fresh, hot Italian roast coffee is brewed perfectly.  Family owned business that puts love and quality into serving their community.  We love this place.  A hidden gem, just over the bridge in Lake Wylie!"}
{"text":"Great soft serve ice cream! Friendly personable staff! Great location! If ever passing through, stop here! It will be worth your while!"}
{"text":"Not the most physically appealing place but the gelato (salted caramel in particular) is amazing! The small was a good size and only $3 including tax; I was very pleasantly surprised. Haven't tried anything else but I will be back for the gelato."}
