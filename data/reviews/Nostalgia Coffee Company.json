{"text":"Food is quite bland. I tried the pulled pork and it was just...bland. Wife tried the chili (which I tried a bite of) and too was bland. Everything is bland, like they are catering to  people with no taste buds (elderly?). I even tried a strawberry milkshake and it was bland. I don't understand how, but it was. We'll be looking elsewhere for our cafe needs."}
{"text":"Definitely the best place in the neighborhood! It takes all my will power not to get the lunch special whatever it may be that day. Everyday"}
{"text":"Some mommy friends and I took a baby gymnastic class at East York Gymnastics Club and we were looking for a place to grab a coffee in the area and came across Nostalgia Coffee. There were four of us with our babies and a guy instantly came over with a booster seat and high chair (some of the babies were fine in their strollers/carriers). They were great about making sure we were taken care of. The coffee was tasty and the food looked amazing, one of the mommies got an egg salad sandwich that she said was really good. The pastries looked nice also but I wasn't hungry (cookies were $1!). This is a not a Starbucks where they are churning out customers (don't get me wrong, Starbucks has it's place); it's a slower pace but with more of a personal touch. We all really enjoyed it and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great little cafe. They have friendly staff and nice big tables to sit at. Their fresh daily soups and sandwich combos are filling, delicious, and well priced ($8.50). Lattes was good ($2.95); had a little too much foam but was tasty. They also have new selections of brewed coffee too to switch things up a bit ($2). I would definitely recommend this place as a go-to cafe spot."}
{"text":"First rest time stopping my in. Great coffee had a latte. Only 2.95 wow!  Cookie as a snack delicious. Quiet atmosphere. The person making the coffees was very happy and upbeat. Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"A cozy neighborhood favourite of mine.   Lovely staff, good menu options and charming decor."}
{"text":"This place is so unique and cozy with its coaches and overall chilled out ambiance. The smoked salmon eggs benny are a treat. Wish pancakes were an option on non-weekend/holidays, but waffles looked tasty too. Service was on point!"}
{"text":"There's so much to like about this place!  Coffee is good. Croissants are very good. Tables & chairs are nice old wooden dining sets.  The place is clean, nicely lit, has clean washrooms and the people that run it are friendly.  I kinda wish it wasn't quite so orderly looking - maybe replace a table or two with a couple of comfy chairs?  But that's small potatoes.  Overall, very nice, very comfortable for working.  Breakfast and lunch menus look very good.  

There are a couple misses in the cooking, so I recommend you stick with sandwiches and quiches.  Overall very good."}
{"text":"Such a cute space. Great food and excellent service. The only downside is that they close in the evenings, otherwise I would be going there all the time!"}
{"text":"I bought one of their homemade cherry cheese danishes and fell in love. I was going to share it, but couldn't. It was the best Danish I've ever had. You can taste the love that goes into their food. I highly recommend this lovely cafe. It has all the comforts of home, and their service is nop notch."}
{"text":"First impressions are important; and as soon as I walked into this cafe, I was in love. What a quaint place to meet with friends and have a cup of coffee. Busy but not crowded, and enough tables and chairs inside and out to sit and relax. Owners and staff are lovely people.

Excellent and courteous customer service.  They bring your food to you and bus the tables as well; they keep the place very clean. Cute washroom decorated with local art that's for sale. Looks like they sold some pieces because there were a few empty hooks on the walls. There are three small tables outside where you can enjoy the fresh air and talk to the friendly locals walking by. 

Had their Mocha Frappe with whipped cream. It had alot of froth on top and the drink was thin not thick like Starbucks. Tasted like a malted drink. Found out that they used powder and not espresso and chocolate to make the drink but still tasty.

Delicious breakfast burrito with egg, tomato, green onion and cheddar cheese. It didn't need any salsa because it was delicious but I might ask for some next time just to add a little heat.

They have a meeting room in the basement that you can rent."}
{"text":"Charming little neighborhood coffee shop with friendly service, tasty food and great prices.   Forget about the coffee chains and support unique, small businesses like Nostalgia!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice people, tasty food, but little bit overpriced for what you getting. Overall a good place to stop for a quick lunch or coffee."}
{"text":"We had coffee, muffins, hot chocolate and the Monte Cristo sandwich. The food was good and we did have to wait a little bit for the sandwich. The seating is limited inside, but is you want a nice quiet place with free wifi that isn't Tim Hortons... This is a great spot."}
{"text":"A lovely little cafe that is a great addition to the neighbourhood. The service is smiling, friendly and efficient, with plenty of treats to tempt you in the glass case beside the cashier. It was very quiet when we first walked in, with just two people quietly reading the morning papers but  quickly filled up with various groups. I ordered the breakfast burrito for lunch. It was a simple wrap with egg, tomato, cheddar cheese and avocado, but it was filling and delicious. No complaints at all!! A great place for lunch or a snack in a cosy welcoming environment."}
{"text":"This place is a GEM in an otherwise boring strip. I am so so happy that it's here! Everything I've ever had there has been tasty and seems like it's made with care. There is wifi and nice large tables for studying. I really hope this business can thrive."}
{"text":"I never noticed this place before but it is just the thing that the neighborhood needs.  It's a quaint little cafe with friendly staff located in this little corner of suburbia with well prepared food at fairly low prices.
It's not meant to be a place you'd hang around all afternoon but a place to sit, have a light lunch or just take a break.  They're not here to cater to everyone and I like it that way."}
{"text":"This cozy spot has great value. Looking for comfort food? This is your spot. Their fresh soup and a sandwich makes for a great lunch. The owners always welcome you with a smile. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nostalgia Coffee Company is such a cute cozy cafe. 

While driving around looking for coffee in the neighbourhood, I drove by Nostalgia and I would not even believe my eyes. An independent Coffee/Espresso Cafe in this area... It is definitely a rare find...

Family owned and run with in house baked savoury pies and pastries. And of course espresso drinks! 

My Americano ($1.90) though a little light for my taste. 

I do love the set up of the space. A lot of nostalgic mix and match furniture and Free Wifi!

Good neighbourhood cafe to come to meet up with friends or just chill a little. 

Meter parking at the front $1.50/hour"}
{"text":"This place is like nothing else in the area. This place is like stepping back in time to a good place. They treat you like family the food is very fresh and tasty, my favorite is the Monty cristo. Coffee and muffins are great.  Fresh soup daily."}
