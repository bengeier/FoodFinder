{"text":"I am a big fan of Thai food and have travelled to Thailand so I know what Authentic means. I can tell you that La Colonie Thaï offers a vast and authentic menu. The decor is beautiful, the quality of the food is top notch, and the service was very welcoming! Price is very reasonable for a BYOW. Through my conversations with our server who happens to be the owner Suk (not sure I spell it right), I can see his passion and his dedication to his business. 

As for the dishes, my husband and I ordered the Tom Yum and Tom Kha soup, and we shared a papaya salad, fish cakes, Pad Kee Mao and Red curry with duck. All the dishes were so flavourful! I feel that we've travelled back to Thailand! We finished off with the delicious and authentic mango sticky rice. Seriously, we really enjoyed all the dishes we've ordered. If I want to be picky, the only thing I would complain about is that the beef in the curry was not tender enough.

I'm so glad I've discovered La Colonie Thai! It's definitively the best Thai restaurant in the South Shore, and one of the best ones in the Montreal area! Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and it was really good. Staff was friendly and accommodating. I found it a little pricey for lunch, but i would go back. It was kid friendly and they had vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Bienvenue au paradis du pad thaï. Jamais je n'en ai mangé un aussi bon. Le secret est dans la sauce, mais cette fois-ci c'est un petit fruit Indien qui vole le spectacle, le tamarin. Je connais l'histoire malgré moi, tellement les employés sont sympathiques et aiment parler de l'esprit familial et leur fierté de travailler dans ce chic resto du vieux St-Lambert. Déjà que le menu est très abordable, en plus on apporte notre vin. Le décor Thaïlandais est très bien. La salle doit contenir près de 100 personnes et  notre bulle n'a souffert d'aucune cacophonie. Je crois que ce secret est dans le décor. Souper pour 2 avec entrées sans dessert tax incluse pour 50$ c'est un exploit pour la rive sud. Je salive encore pour cette inimitable sauce aigre sucré au tamarin..."}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant. Met Souk the owner and chef. I ordered pad Thai to take home. Absolutely beautiful decor in the restaurant. Bring your own wine and eat amazing food. Best Pad Thai I have ever had! Cannot wait to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant but food just average.  Ordered pad Thai with egg and the dish tasted as if it had been rewarmed numerous times -- definitely not fresh."}
