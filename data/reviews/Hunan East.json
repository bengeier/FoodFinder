{"text":"So happy to stumble upon this wonderful place. Can't drive by without stopping for String Beans and anything else on the menu! Husband loves the Hot and Sour soup. Dinner for 7 was under $100 and everyone was full!! No liquor license though. Bummer"}
{"text":"Had to go to the Richmond mall yesterday and was in the mood for Chinese, so checked out Hunan East after being intrigued by other Yelp reviews.

  Maybe my palate doesn't appreciate so-called 'authentic' Chinese, because this stuff was weak.  Ordered a fairly straight forward dish found in every joint like this, which others consider to be an American-ized dish, Kung Pao chicken, but substituted tofu for chicken.  Absolutely no heat to it at all, and sorely lacking in flavor.  I've never used the soy sauce packets you're given at Chinese restaurants, but had to for the first time here just to get through the bland sauce.  More expensive than similar Chinese places convinced me I don't think I'll ever be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese decor. Typical regional food, but that also means you may not find much of what other chinese places offer. The food's never bowled me over, but it's also not bad.

But the spring rolls are some of the best in Cleveland. Thin, crispy, not oily. Worth ordering just them for pick up."}
{"text":"I love this place. Tried the chicken lo mein here for the first time today and I love it!
I do find their wonton soup to be a little meh on some days usually daytime, but better in the evenings when all the dishes get it.
I am usually very happy when I eat here.
I love their little spring rolls, I could eat a dozen at one sitting.
Their portions are huge, the waitstaff is authentic.  You can go in there alone or with a large group.
I have had more good dishes there then bad ones, the only meal I would not suggest  is the Peking Duck, it was not what I am used too, too dry."}
{"text":"Picked up an order of the Hunan chicken, vegetable fried rice, vegetable lo main and steamed dumplings. They were fantastic and the portion size was much larger than expected! Definitely plan on going back soon!"}
{"text":"This was average Chinese food.  The veggies were fresh and not overcooked.  Service was efficient.  Overall the flavors seemed to have something missing.  It would be OK in a pinch but we weren't swooning."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Cle veland! I have been going here for 15 years! Friendly staff and great food, prices and portions!"}
{"text":"By far, the best authentic Chinese food I have found in the Cleveland area! We ordered seven dishes and nothing disappointed! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food for a price you cannot beat! These people make me feel welcome all the time! I have been living in this area for a few weeks and I have been their at least 5 times.I will continue to go back knowing the people who works here treats me like family"}
{"text":"Awful, argumentative staff. 4 of us went for Christmas lunch. Won ton soup was just boiled water with dumplings.  Fried rice was plain brown uncle Ben's rice..tasteless! A patron in our group ordered Peking duck aka shoe leather!! ANY DECENT restaurant would have asked the patron if he would like something else after expressing his displeasure...NOT THIS PLACE! The server did not care. After expressing our disappointment several times, the check arrives and no adjustment was made. We asked about a bill adjustment and the chief honcho comes out from the kitchen and says \"then why did u order the duck?\"..we were in shock and she literally was arguing with him about it! She eventually removed the duck, but charge him for the soup and spring roll ala carte!! He goes to pay at the register and we hear them arguing again..ALL of our meals should have been comped for ruining our Christmas meal! Keep this up and there will be a \"for lease\" sign up soon! I was waiting for John Quinonis to come around the corner with his crew..that is how outrageous this experience was for us..no joke..it was the real deal. Never going back!!"}
{"text":"I've known this restaurant for years, the same owner been there forever. The place might be old, but the food is always good. If you order fried rice, order ?????that's what Chinese do."}
{"text":"First, expect traditional Chinatown NY service.  It may come off as rude, but it's just....intense. 

If compared to other take out restaurants, it's a 4 star because of quality and portion."}
{"text":"Ordered from this restaurant right before closing on Saturday  January  7th. I have been to many Chinese restaurants, but this one, I  will never return. I ordered the pork egg foo young  with fried rice  and egg rolls. When my friend  returned home with my order, immediately  the Chinese  food had a strong fishy/seafood  odor! I know each restaurant  may prepare their dishes their own particular  way, but I  have never in my life had egg  foo young the way this restaurant  prepares it--there were two big puffed, dried out  patties with huge pieces of tough, inedible  pork! There was no evidence  that  this egg foo young had any egg in it. When I  tried to cut into it (it was tough), it was nothing but a mound of onion and pork dipped into a batter and deep fried.

The fried rice  was  just that--plain, fried rice--no onions ,  bean sprout, peas, carrots, or eggs. Last, the egg roll filling had a mushy texture  like it was overcooked . Will not  be returning...will go to my usual  spot on highland  road."}
{"text":"What a gem. We ordered two seafood orders and vegetable fried rice. All the ingredients are incredibly fresh. The portions are gigantic. Everything tasted wonderful."}
{"text":"Delicious food and outstanding, friendly customer service.  The best way to judge the quality of the food in a Chinese restaurant is to see how many other Asians are there.  When I was there it was 3/4 Asian customers - that tells you how authentic the dishes are!  The \"secret\"  menu is completely in Chinese (no pictures!) so you are unfortunately out of luck if you aren't with someone that can read Chinese, which we were and here hence fortunate to experience some out-of-the-ordinary Chinese cuisine.  Food was fresh and the flavors were outstanding.  On a Tuesday evening, it was packed, and am told that it is pretty hard to get a seat on the weekends.  That tells you something, too!   And as others have said, portions are very generous and the value is good.  We had 5 in our party, ordered 5 dishes, noodles, and soup for under $90 and came home with almost another meal's worth of food!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for decades, starting back when there was not even a picture book for the truly authentic Chinese part of the two menus. I can not comment about the quality of the Americanized \"regular\" menu, but the \"Chinese style\" picture book items are fabulous! I have eaten almost every dish from that menu and you pretty much can't go wrong, but my favorites include Mongolian duck, shrimp and scallops in black bean sauce, beef with sour vegetables and mu shu chicken. Not only are the portions huge (you probably will have enough leftovers for a second meal at home), but the prices are more than reasonable. 
Do not expect to linger for long, as the place can be very busy. The service is exceptionally quick and they bring the check fast too, so this is not a place to have after dinner conversations or the like.  There is almost no selection of deserts either. 
The decor is your standard Chinese restaurant, nothing better or worse. The owners and staff are very nice, but some speak English better than others. Mike, the owner, is great and may chat with you, if he has the time.
I love Asian food and have eaten at hundreds of Asian restaurants both in Cleveland and around the country and even abroad. I feel very lucky to have Hunan East fifteen minutes from my home, which is why I have chosen to eat there almost weekly for over twenty years. The food is both different and delicious and you certainly won't go away hungry."}
{"text":"Our go to Chinese restaurant. We usually get it to go. Hunan spicy fried noodles are fantastic. Barbeque pork egg foo young is one of our favorites. Any of the fried rice selection are awesome. Be prepared to pack away leftovers in the fridge the portions are large to say the least."}
{"text":"Not that great kinda average actually. I hate the egg rolls that are really thin, like the see through ones. They have those. I got the General Tso and the rice was bland as well as the chicken & the chicken was hard because it was over cooked. All in all prob won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Their Chinese menu is extensive.  The ingredients are fresh and good quality.   Dishes are less oily and less salty than typical Chinese restaurants.  Pretty authentic flavor compared to other Chinese restaurants in this area.  Service is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"An almost weekly favorite.  Make sure you check out the Chinese Menu.  Everything's good but honey walnut shrimp is a must.  Personal service.  A neighborhood restaurant worth driving across town for."}
{"text":"My go to Asian food splurge when I've had a long day. It's authentic and delicious, with large portions and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Ugh. Saw the great reviews of this place, had been meaning to try it for years. Finally had an errand to do in the area, dropped by. Friend and I ordered off the Chinese menu: fried pork chop with noodles and Shanghai fried rice cakes. Waitresses speak Cantonese (and Mandarin)!

After waiting an epically long time for our food, the fried pork chop with noodle soup came first. Noodle soup was all right, fairly large portion. We asked for the pork chop on the side, since it usually comes in the soup, which makes the fried pork chop kind of soggy. We asked the waitress if we could borrow food scissors to cut the pork chop into strips (as is typical at every Chinese place I've been to that sells this dish). She was confused, and when we asked her again, she picked up my knife and my friend's fork and tried to cut it for us herself at the table. Exasperated, we gave up and did it ourselves. A decent portion of the pork was raw. As in, it was red. Not just barely-there pink. We left it on the table since we didn't have time to ask them to fix it since I had other errands to run. At least the noodle soup was fine?

The Shanghai rice cakes came next and it was near unidentifiable. It looked overcooked and mushy, and after tasting a couple pieces, it was evident that it was not Shanghai style, nor was it cooked properly. 

We paid and high-tailed it out of there. They did apologize for the raw pork even though I made no mention of it."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover because the pages in this book is awesome. If you are looking for authentic Chinese food go no farther.. u have found the place.
I will say this is a perfect place for a group of people then you can try more dishes. first and foremost order from the picture menu!! The potion sizes are huge can easily serve a family of 4. The food is flavorful. I have nothing but great things to say. The service is good nothing to complain about there. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!
I've heard people within the Chinese community say it is the best in Cleveland and I understand why.  The service is always polite, and they can get food to your table faster than you can order it. If you read Chinese, ask for the Chinese menu. (Otherwise you get a picture menu which is a little insulting but still helpful.)  If you speak Chinese (or know someone who does) you'll get even better service. This place is small and always packed! Definitely worth it. A lot of food for a little price!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today, at the suggestion of a couple friends.  I'm having a hard time rating it, but it will require another visit to make up my mind.  

Decor:  Evidently, this place was inherited by the current proprietors as the decor suggests a seafood joint of distinctly un-Asian origin.  My guess is that the art on the walls and the sculptures of fish were present long before soy sauce was ever splashed within these walls.

Food:  Given the name, I was expecting Hunanese food... so I went through the chinese only menu to get an idea of what was available.  There was a smattering of dishes that were \"general\"b the majority did suggest an origin in the vicinity of Hunan.  Problem:  I love some Hunanese dishes, especially the ones I got to enjoy in Hubei, but I've never eaten an extensive amount of Hunanese dishes in a proper Hunan fashion.

I ordered two of my standard test dishes to try to get an idea what the Chef's background was.  I ordered a Mapo Tofu and Jajiangmian.  

The Jajiangmian was okay.  Unlike Beijing and S. Korean variations, this wasn't in the black, charred onion based sauce that dominates in S. Korean joints.   Their version had carrots, celery, dried tofu, garlic, spring onions and pork strips.  The effect was okay, but not (in my mind) traditional northern Chinese.  The noodles they used are yimian noodles.

The Mapo Tofu that they made was much closer to the mark than that I had at Siam cafe.  The Tofu itself was fresh, though a little more rigid than I prefer.  I prefer the type that essentially disintegrates on contact with anything more forceful than blown vapor.  The sauce was appropriately red.  Their version is vegetarian, with no pork.  The garlic was cut in larger chunks (I prefer finely diced, with nearly ground pork),   Spring onions were also mixed in for colour variation.  Flavour was close -- except a key missing aspect:  almost no detectable peppercorn.  I like to tingle with the numbing, anesthetic effect.

So... neither was great -- but neither were bad, if I just forgot that I've had other versions of those dishes.

Thus, I had to ask:  Where were the proprietor and cook from?  Well, they have a Cantonese manager and a Shanghainese chef.  When next I visit, I'm going to ask for more Shanghainese dishes and see how that turns out.  

My general sense is that the food is authentic homestyle southern chinese -- though not Cantonese south, like... Shanghai south.  

So... next attempt will be to try the beef tendon, and check out some of the cook's specialties."}
{"text":"Best place around Cleveland. Delicious, Big plates, Good price. Perfect place have a dinner with family or friends."}
{"text":"This was the first Chinese restaurant that I came to when I was first moving here. I went with some family friends (Taiwanese) and they talked about how they used to go there all the time when they lived in Mayfield Heights. It's a pretty good go-to place, but I wouldn't rank it on the top of my list.

Some favorites here are 1) dou gan rou shi (hope I got the pinyin right) -- spicy dried tofu with pork and the 2) mapo tofu.

Decor is really funny -- classic effortless kitschy Midwestern Chinese restaurant style = leaving up the decor from the previous owner. I think it used to be some sort of fishing store. Random blue collared guys there often too.

It's really good for groups (large round Chinese dining tables) or smaller groups (booths.) 

Thinking about the dou gan rou shi is making me hungaryyy..."}
{"text":"I did not dine in here but had someone bring me back some takeout. I ordered one of my favorite dishes Beef Lo Mein and couldn't wait to tear into it. No sooner then I tasted my first forkful did I spit it right back out. It was so heavily salted that it was completely inedible. Foolishly I took another taste hoping I just grabbed a bad bite and was punished yet again. This is the sort of experience I find inexcusable and will not be giving them a second chance. People used to like this place but it clearly is on a major decline. Go elsewhere for your Chinese food fix, there are plenty of better options around."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  Generous portions, wonderful flavor. Yelp has once again helped me to find fantastic food in a foreign city. Cleveland has been full of good food and good people."}
{"text":"Hunan East is one of the favorite places in Cleveland area! It is especially good for big family reunions! The prices are fair and the staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Each time my experience was worse than before,. Tonight Wanton soup had very few actual wantons in it. Orange Beef was not cooked through, and wasn't very good. All in all most of our entrees were average. But the orange beef and lack of wontons makes it a two star affair."}
{"text":"Hot & Sour soup is best in town!  No lie!

Egg rolls are interesting.  They are different than anything I have ever had - they are small and incredibly tasty.

I have been told by seasoned travelers that this is the real McCoy of Chinese and by far, the best in town.

The have a photo menu too.

It is clean.  Service is prompt.  Food is fresh.  IMO priced reasonably.  Owners are kind."}
{"text":"This was my absolute FAVORITE neighborhood hole-in-the-wall when I lived in Cleveland. It's unassuming and almost unnoticeable -- it's in a strip mall, for goodness' sake! -- except for the large red and yellow sign above the door. 

Mike, the buff owner, always comes by to talk and make you feel welcome. He's a pro at suggesting what to eat, and often it's not even on the menu. There's the typical Americanized Chinese menu with the staples (sweet and sour chicken, general tso's chicken, beef and broccoli, etc.), then there's the Chinese menu. It looks more extensive and is entirely in Chinese, so I have no clue what it actually says. Even so, I repeatedly received that menu (while my compatriots received regular menus) whenever I dined in, and I'd actually feel embarrassed to tell them that I'm not Chinese, nor can I read it, so I'd need a different menu. But I'd redeem my cool points because I'd ask for the picture menu. That's right: there's also a picture menu you can request that features delectable pictures of dishes not on the regular menu. I recommend asking for this when you eat there. Not only does it make you look seasoned, but looking at it will make your mouth water. 

Another trick a lot of the regulars use is the old standby of looking at a neighboring table's dishes, then pointing and telling Mike or your server that you want what they're eating. I discovered the fish in black bean sauce this way, and it became a regular request ever after. 

The place is always packed, and it's always packed with Asian people, so you know it's authentic. The waitstaff is fantastic, and they all remember you if you dine there a few times. Water glasses never seem to dip below full, as they're constantly topping you off. Constantly. 

Pretty much anything off the picture menu is fabulous. I'm a bit so-so on the American menu, but I generally don't care much for the diluted food, if you know what I mean. Order the ho fun shrimp -- and order it spicy -- if you're looking for savory goodness. (It's not on the menu, but again, they customize just for you.) They don't scrimp on the shrimp, as I consistently got more than a dozen very large suckers every time I ordered it. By far, this was my favorite dish.

There are few things I miss about Cleveland, but this is damn sure one of them!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants, especially because it's close to home.  You can't beat the choices and the prices!  I like this restaurant because I can eat-in.  There are numerous options.  The dinner options include a spring roll, chow mein noodles, hot tea, wonton soup and your choice of entree for less than $10!   My favorite is the Hunan Chicken, which includes a variety of veggies stir-fried in a spicy brown sauce and served with a side of rice.  The portion is huge, I always have enough left over for lunch the next day.   The staff is super nice and food is consistently tasty.  I will return!"}
{"text":"I just called over the phone to ask for a traditional chinese dish (pan fried beef rice noodles). I also ordered green beans. This was a pick up. When we got there, it wasn't even ready, they did not make it! They said they didn't have the noodles and was going to tell us when we got there (???) They told my husband if we wanted something else as my husband was going to order something else, they said they would make our dish (??). We got RICE vermicilli and not the flat noodles. Every chinese person knows the dish that we want. 

I like this restaurant because they can make chinese food that is authentic but they are def not consistent with their service and unfortunately, there isn't much of a choice around here (we normally go to Wonton Gourmet). 

Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Chinese. My son loves the sweet and sour chicken and crab cheese. My husband had general tso's chicken which was very good and I had the egg drop soup and walnut chicken. Great flavor on all the dishes. We usually get carry out but have dined in and had friendly service. Best Chinese in our area!"}
{"text":"We have been eating in and taking out Hunan East's food for two decades.  It is the absolute best Chinese food on the east side---and you can have your pedestrian Cantonese or, wonderful authentic Hunan dishes from the regular or Special menus.  I will admit that the egg rolls are not impressive.  But the Hot and Sour soup certainly is.  The Beef Satay appetizer is delicious, as are the potstickers--I love mine steamed with hot oil on the side.  Ordering can be a challenge because so many choices of very good food.  For example, our favorite dishes are:  Veggie Egg Foo Young.  I can guarantee the you have never seen this dish prepared better than this and it tastes super.  Two HUGE servings, about the size of a softball each--not the sorry flat pancakes served elsewhere.  Hunan Beef.  Can be ordered at any amount of heat--I like mine medium, using the perfect white rice as a contrast.  Lettuce Wrappers off the Special Menu.  An amazing combination of chopped chicken and Chinese vegetables with a delicious tangy sauce, served on and along side of huge lettuce leafs for wrapping.  Ho Fun Chicken.  Wide noodles, all kinds of veggies, chicken and wonderful sauce.  Finally---ALL the fresh shrimp dishes are fresh and wonderful.

The owners are on premise and speak perfect English as a second language.  The servers are monitored and taught to do things correctly--sometimes there is a language barrier but the owners often intercede.  

It's really nice to have a high quality Chinese restaurant as fine as this nearby.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! We ate here tonight. I had Lemon Fish- to die for. Hubby had Seafood Hot Pot and ate more than he's eaten in a week. Seven reasons we love this place: 1) No MSG! Food is fantastic without the use of flavor-Enhancers! 2) Owner and staff are friendly 3) Have been dining here regularly for many years and have never had a bad meal 4) Don't even think about going on Christmas Day. The crowds are big and we have fun every year picking the perfect time to go! 5) The owner runs a tight ship- I wish that I could understand what she is saying when she's giving orders like a five-star General... way to be a lady boss! 6) Hot and Sour Soup- simply the best! 7)The picture menu!"}
{"text":"This is really good Chinese, best in the east side suburbs. We shared Hunan Beef and Pork Dumplings. Both were enormous portions for the money, but the Hunan beef could have been a little more spicy. Our waitress was helpful in picking out how much food to get. We will definitely be back to try some of the more adventurous dishes or the hot pot on a very cold night. For a first time we didn't go full force. Also, better to go to a place like this with a group of 6 or more so that you can share several things."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! We tried the sweet and sour chicken and the orange chicken. Huge portions!!"}
{"text":"Not the best I've ever had (having frequented various parts of Asia), but this is the best Chinese restaurant in the Cleveland area. Period. 

My family and I have frequented this restaurant countless times over the past several years. This is, and still is our go-to Chinese place when we don't feel like cooking at home. 

The owners, a husband and wife, when not manning the front desk, can ofttimes be found apron in hand, tossing the wok and cooking when the place gets busy. 

If you're fortunate enough to read Chinese, get the Chinese menu. If you don't, do yourself a favour and make a Chinese-speaking friend just so you can come back here and order from said Chinese menu. 

We've brought scores of business guests from across China to this restaurant over the years and they've never failed to be impressed by the quality of the food. Recently, one particular guest from Szechuan, famed for it's I-need-a-tongue-transplant-yeah-it's-that-spicy hot food, commented on how weak a supposedly spicy dish was at Blue Point Grille downtown. He was brought here, the owner specially prepared a chilli pepper & oil-laden dish and...well, let's just say those weren't just tears of joy he left with."}
{"text":"Way too salty. The fried fish dish was too dry."}
{"text":"Excellent shredded pork with garlic sauce...but must order the Chinese version. It has by far the most authentic Chinese food in East Cleveland. The restaurant is very clean but quite small. Service is good. Definitely will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"For a Chinese this is one of places I can find authentic Chinese food, more are the east region of China (Shanghai etc) instead of Cantonese style food you see the most. The price is reasonable and the portion is A LOT! If you dare to eat pig feet/organs (all authentic Chinese food) you can find them here! :) they have two types of menus: one is for authentic Chinese food(in Chinese); one is for Americanized Chinese food( in English). They also have a photo menu which maybe good for people wanna order authentic Chinese food without knowing Chinese."}
{"text":"In a word, yuck! We went in person to order take out & pre paid.They told us the order would be done in 20 minutes. Came back in twenty minutes and it was not done. 10 more minutes, they tell us \"you look familiar?\" Apparently they had forgotten totally about this order. 

In another 45 minutes we finally had the food, but it was terrible. Very little seasoning, very bland like they rushed everything. Then they put it all in a veggie tray/box for us to carry it home and there was sauce all over everything. 

The next day I went to throw out this box and later found some weird looking ants/bugs where the box was. I can't say for sure they are from this Chinese restaurant but I have my suspicions. Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food for a decent price. This has become my go to spot when I am on this side of town. The portions are great and the taste is even better."}
{"text":"Hunan East was our favorite Chines Restaurant even though it's not very close to where we live, but was worth the drive. Our last visit was our last. The food, usually delicious was not. The chicken didn't taste right and the waitress did not give us an appropriate answer. We heard other diners complaining and unfortunatelt they were correct. Fire the cook before your business withers away. Disappointing visit."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 5 because although it is not the best chinese restaurant I've ever had (granted I grew up in Taiwan), it is the best chinese restaurant in Cleveland. And for that, I give it a 5 for being top-notch in Cleveland.

Don't come into this restaurant expecting the best Chinese restaurant in the world, but if you've only tried food in Cleveland, then this is the place to go.

Overall, I do really enjoy their food. When I go, they hand me the Chinese menu which has alot more food choices including some reallyy authentic ones. The food here is as authentic as Cleveland asian food goes and it has really authentic food that I wouldn't be able to order at LiWah or Siam Cafe. The other thing I love about this place is the owner is reallyyy friendly and for the price you pay, you sure get a HUUGEE serving of food that will last more than a meal!

Recommended dishes: I don't know if I'd be able to recommend a specific dish but the one dish I somehow end up ordering there is the Baby Bamboo with Pork dish. The other one is this noodle soup (only on their chinese menu and only served during dinner) called Dai Lu Mein. 

To Try for Comparison: If you want, you can order their General Tso's or Orange Chicken. I usually don't order that but all my cleveland friends who have all LOVE their orange chicken and general tsa's chicken because there are the chicken aren't completely covered in the batter. 

Least liked dish: the only dish here I'm not a huge fan of is their beef wide rice noodles. And honestly, I'm surprised that that is the 1 dish they do not make well there since it is such a common dish (you can find it almost at any chinese restaurant)"}
{"text":"I have been back here almost weekly since writing my last review. This will blow any place on the east side out of the water unless you like your Chinese food from a can. 

Side note: 

The authentic stuff is mostly Cantonese. I do not know anywhere with in 5 hour drive that you can find a robust Hunan or Schezwan menu. 

Just about anything from the Chinese picture menu is good. Had something called Pork Jaja Mein. Or something like that. It was on of the to 10 best things I have eaten. It was a huge bowl of Chinese lomein noodles smothered in a spicy, garlicky, gingery, sauce with pork, onions tofu, veggies and diced Chinese shrooms. Absolutely amazing. 

I was stuffed after about eating 1/3 of it. 

This is super munchie food. 

Other outstanding dishes: 

The shrimp or seafood in black bean sauce is to die for. 
Chicken or Beef with Chinese mushrooms. 
Beef and sour vegetables. 
Chicken in garlic sauce. 
Kung Bo Chicken 
Look at what others are eating and that is how I have discovered some really good finds. Or just ask me. 


Of the American Menu the chef's specialties are very good. 

The General's Chicken is very good, you can tell it's white meat chicken breast. 
Triple Delight 

As far as food goes this is some of the best Asian food east side. The ambiance, not so much. 

There is no liquor so drink before if you feel the urge. 

The prices are super reasonable."}
{"text":"Overall a poor experience, food took longer than stated, my order wasn't correct then had to wait longer, sauce was leaked all over the bags of takeout and food was bland :/"}
{"text":"Order from the picture menu for the best authentic Chinese cuisine outside asiatown- actually better than lots of the places there. We love the sour vegetables with beef or chicken, pork with tofu, scallops in black bean sauce, Chinese style moo shu pork, pocket tofu, etc. Avoid the egg rolls. However, their egg foo young on the regular menu is excellent. We have been coming here for many years and food is always spot on."}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Westlake to Richmond Heights bc a friend recommended this restaurant as \"the best Chinese food they've eatwn\" however, I must disagree.

I can ignore the (scary) location and the (shady looking) aesthetic of it no problem. But the menu offers no explanation or ingredients for the dishes so make sure you know exactly what you want.

The food was only so-so. Not worth the drive but edible. The portions are HUGE however so that's a plus.

Some of the staff could use some manners or at least lessons in being polite to customers, even if they're faking it."}
{"text":"I'd really given up on Chinese in Cleveland outside of Asia Town until I gave in to a dumpling craving and tried Hunan East based on the trusty Yelp app and word of mouth. Walking in, you can tell they do a big takeout business. We were given the menu and after seeing the size of the entrees decided on just one entree for the two of us, an order of dumplings/potstickers, and got the soup and egg roll they offer with the entree for like $1 more. Hands down one of the best hot and sour soups I've had. The egg roll was more of a spring roll and worth eating (normally I just skip on this). Dumplings were huge but a bit \"doughy.\" Entree was big as expected, and we had so much food, enough for a whole other meal.

After doing some extra reading before our return visit, I found out there was a Chinese menu you have to specifically ask for! You MUST do this if you don't want the Americanized Chinese. This time there were 4 adults and based on previous experience, we decided on 3 entrees with the soup and egg roll. Again, plenty of food (we couldn't even finish- with 3 really big eaters, that was a lot of food)! There are no prices on the Chinese menu and it's all pictures, but the prices are very fair- It was around $40 for the four of us.

I'd definitely return here for more when I don't want to drive all the way to Asia Town...will just remember the Chinese menu for all future visits:)"}
{"text":"Stuck in a wasteland of strip malls that is Richmond Heights and tucked between a Nail Salon and a Pizza Joint, Hunan East calls home. 

The decor consists, oddly enough, of fish. Lots of former sea dwelling flounder's.  Fish hung on the walls and several fish tanks throughout the dining room. Nemo would feel right at home. 

The menu has all of the Americanized Chinese favorites including General Tao's, Kung Poa Chicken, Egg Rolls, etc. For more adventurous options, ask for the Chinese menu, which consists of a binder full of pictured menu items, some of which aren't on the normal menu. 

The wait staff is overly friendly and plenty accommodating. Water and hot tea are provided for you upon seating. The customers that filled the dining room are predominately of Asian descent. Always a good sign in telling how acceptable of a Chinese eatery this may be. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the fried dumplings filled with pork and dipped in soy. For dinner, I ordered the Spicy Hunan Duck, which I found very satisfying with just the right amount of heat. My wife ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Shrimp and found a few shrimp that weren't deveined properly, always a turnoff. The portions were absolutely humongous. For less than $10 a dinner, there was plenty to share or take home for another meal. 

Overall, I found Hunan East to be very reasonable, friendly, accommodating and better than average Chinese cuisine. This location is within walking distance from my home, which is also a bonus. The next time I'm craving a quick Chinese meal, I'm sure I'll be back. Just make sure to clean the shrimp for chrissakes!"}
{"text":"The flavors were very good with all the dishes that were ordered. The spicy dishes were not overwhelmingly spicy but had a nice kick and were very flavorful. They did not skimp on the shrimp either, as some Chinese restaurants do. We were a table of 8. The dishes we ordered were: shrimp in black bean sauce (VERY good flavors-no spice); kung pao shrimp (another VERY good shrimp dish w/ great flavor and nice and spicy); shrimp lo mein was shrimp lo mein; garlic pork (awesome flavors and spice); beef and broccoli; and vegetable lo mein. The servers were very attentive with keeping hot tea on the ready and our beverages filled. We were seated at a row table and shared most of our dishes. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow! We went to eat here lunch for the first time and just lovvvvved it! Warm and calming atmosphere and great service! The food is delicious! We will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"So there are really only two mostly-authentic Chinese places in Cleveland.  One of them is Wonton Gourmet.  But everybody knows about that one.  The other is this restaurant, Hunan East.  Admittedly, it's a bit out of the way, and the decor leaves not much to be desired, and one time they undercooked a fish that we ordered, but it'll do.  They have menus in both Chinese and English, and both Chinese and Americanized menu options.

The food is not the best, but considering its location in fabulous Cleveland, it's pretty nice.  I'd totally come here more often if the restaurant moved its location maybe a couple of miles to the west."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. Didn't enjoy it and will never go back. But they did apply a law enforcement discount which I really like. Didn't really think they would or if they did. Didn't see it coming lol."}
{"text":"Not good. All the different dishes taste like they use the same exact sauce, egg rolls are something that came out of the freezer section at Sam's club and their wonton soup is really salty. 

Unfortunately the only reason I think this gets decent reviews is because the east side is lacking a truly good Chinese place, so people can't compare. Although this might be the best Chinese on the east side it doesn't mean it's actually good. Take the drive to Jackie chens for takeout."}
{"text":"Best authentic Chinese food you'll find here besides the dim sum places around Asia Plaza."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food, huge portions, and an owner with a great sense of humor.  Hunan East may look like your everyday Chinese suburban takeout joint, but its quality definitely surpasses what you would get at your typical Chinese takeout restaurant.

I've had 5 of their dishes now and I would say that all of them are tasty.  The large picture menu makes it easy to order items.   I ordered the hot and sour soup the last time I was there and enjoyed it so much that I ordered a second bowl.  The ma po tofu is decent.   The vegetable dishes were delicious.  If you're very hungry, go for the lion's head with vermicelli.   Essentially the filling of a chicken dumpling rolled into a meatball, one of the 5 meatballs in the dish easily had more meat than 4 normal sized meatballs.  And the noodles in the dish were good too."}
{"text":"A Chinese restaurant with a strange combination: a Shanghainese owner with his Cantonese wife, with a name that emphasizes spicy Hunan cuisine and a menu with fusion Chinese food. But the dishes were quite OK actually. The appetizer spicy beef and lamb pot were particularly nicely flavored and the portion size was worthy of the price. It seems they offered Chinese menu to Chinese customers and English menu to other customers."}
{"text":"So, for everyone who used to get frustrated ordering takeout from the traditional \"Chinese style\" menu... You're welcome. I just took about 50 pictures of all of the pages in the traditional menu."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese food for Ohio. We go every two weeks or so and live off leftovers for a few days (the portions are quite large on the Chinese menu). Ask for the Chinese Menu to get better food options (it has pictures).

Crowd favorites: Chicken with Chinese Vegetables; Walnut Shrimp; Sauteed Shrimp, Scallops, Squid (I may have the order wrong on that one, but it's the only option with 4 \"s\" words in it).

If you don't use n-1 style ordering (or less) you WILL be taking home leftovers, so heads-up."}
{"text":"Friendly service, but sub par food across the board. Reviews looked great, but didn't match the food our large party received. Hopefully just an off night."}
{"text":"I won't lie, I came in a little skeptical... the business didn't look like much from the outside... but WOW did I leave impressed!!

It's best just to walk you through the experience:

When we walked in, we could tell by how crowded it was that we had picked a winner for lunch. We were sat right away, and a waitress came right over immediately. The first thing they gave us automatically was a pot of hot tea, which was a great way to start the meal!

They had glass containers of sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard on the table, rather than just the packets that are a pain to open, which was very convenient.

I ordered an appetizer of the crab Rangoon, and my friend ordered a few egg rolls and bowl of hot and sour soup. 5 minutes later they were in front of us! My rangoons were GREAT! They were fresh, crisp, and filled with a yummy concoction of crab and cream cheese. My friend also said that was the best hot and sour soup he had ever had.

Right when we were finishing up our apps, the meal was already coming out. When they brought the first plate out, I thought that the waitress had screwed up and given us both the same thing and that one plate was to share... it was huge! It was a serving for 2-3! But, no, that was a SINGLE ORDER! I got the sesame chicken and MAN was it good!  They use very little breaking, and the chicken is fresh and thick and of good quality. The sauce was not overly sweet like some restaurants and had more of a soy base. It was outstanding.

We also got a big bowl of white fluffy rice which was obviously very fresh and the perfect consistency. 

I did not have a single complaint about our lunch, and will definitely be back for more!

I highly recommend it here, but bring an appetizer, because the portion sizes will drop your jaw! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Chinese places around the Heights area, the choices are plenty, and trust me I've tried them all.  Hunan East has the most authenticity out of all of them.  Take a look at their picture menu and be brave, otherwise stick to the usual suspects and enjoy.  My staples that you would thing all Chinese places would get right are Egg Drop, Hot & Sour Soup, Crab Rangoons, and  something standard like a Hunan Beef or Hot Pot.  This joint has never let me down.  One item that gets over looked but is a must try, Pork Lo-Mein, try it, its awesome!!  Who really cares if there are fish on the wall??  The service is great, food comes out hot and fast, and it seems to be the place to go for the local Asian community."}
{"text":"Very good food quality and great value on price!   Make sure to ask for the home made spicy mustard much better than packets!"}
{"text":"It's as good as it gets on authentic Chinese food outside downtown Chinatown area. The flavor and taste is very Cantonese style.  Problem is very crowded if you go late. Worth the wait.

I like the picture album of the menu which makes selection a lot easier. The flavor of the food is excellent for me. For those who says it's bland, maybe need to de-salt your taste bud. American culture is addicted to salt and sugar."}
{"text":"This is the best and most authentic Chinese food on the east side!  We skipped the $6.95 lunch special (which includes tea, rice and egg rolls) and ordered from the regular menu (but got complimentary tea and rice anyway but declined the egg rolls).  Portions are enormous, so plan to share or take extras home. The hot and sour soup was tasty and tangy, a far cry from the gelatinous corn starch concoctions usually seen in Americanized Chinese restaurants.  We had mushu chicken, a Chinese comfort food of sorts, which came with plum sauce and wrappers, as well as an enormous platter of tasty filling with a scrambled egg cap to be mixed in. (Note, I was offered the \"English menu or Chinese menu\" version and naturally chose the Chinese one, which apparently contains more exotic ingredients than the other version, including bamboo shoots (not just the canned rectangular ones) and black woodear fungus.). We also had the shrimp, scallop, and squid in black bean sauce.  All the seafood was breaded and fried, then mixed with the sauce, but the scallops and shrimp in particular were generous in size and perfectly cooked. Service is prompt and friendly without being pushy. The seating area is much cleaner and more welcoming than many other downtown Asian restaurants.

We normally go to the Chinatown area for Chinese food, but every time I come here, I wonder why we don't go more often. I'll have to remedy that! Agree with others to ask for the picture menu."}
{"text":"Raised in New York and moving to Ohio I had a really hard time finding decent Chinese food. This place is one of the best!! Always my go to when I want Chinese food, everything taste amazing!! To top it off never had a bad customer service experience :)"}
{"text":"So the food is actually really good, but my review is on something else: the service

Ordered takeout over the phone and the lady was so rude when I asked about the tofu rice and she was practically SCREAMING at me no joke asking what kind? I'm not sure what provoked her since I literally just asked her about the menu. She must be fed up, I would hate my job too if I had to answer calls for a living. When I went to go pick up my food (which is the last time I will ever go here) she was stiff and just had a scowl on her face. The first time I ever ordered over the phone the guy told me that you have to have 5+ people if you want to dine in...
Never again.  Rude ass people, I will pay a lot more money and drive a little farther to PF Changs than put up with that ignorant lady again. BYE."}
{"text":"Best chinese food on the east side if not the city. There is actually a regular menu- good but not adventurous, perfect for a friend who wants regular americanized chinese food, a picture menu- awesome tastebud tweaking greatness, and a chinese menu with a few things not on the picture menu (my only gripe is it's not translated but it's because it's difficult to do and some stuff needs deep explaination). 

The staff is friendly and courteous and will gladly help you find something interesting within your taste level. When you ask for something very spicy here they actually make it spicy.

Current favorites - thinly sliced lamb in hot pepper sauce. Black bean shrimp. Pig kidney."}
{"text":"I don't like the taste there. The food are too oily feel like a bit Americanized but my other two Chinese friends think it is a very authentic Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Order off the picture menu for some of the most authentic Chinese food outside of Chinatown! 

On my most recent experience, I ordered both the eggplant with garlic sauce and lamb stew with Chinese vegetables. Both were delicious! If you've ordered this eggplant dish before, the authentic version at Hunan East might taste a bit different- it's served hot and sour style with chilis, but is not hot enough to keep your mouth ablaze. I'd rate it a medium on the heat scale. And the lamb... OMG that lamb was incredible! It's a hotpot stew with tender, falling off the bone meat, green onions and bok choy. Very flavorful, yet not spicy at all (think below mild, even). You can even suck the marrow out of the bones, if that's your thing, which put a smile on my face. 

The other diners I ate with ordered food from the regular American-style Chinese menu and reported that their dishes were above average (beef with broccoli and orange chicken), so less adventurous eaters will still be pleased with their old standbys."}
{"text":"The whole steamed walleye is pretty  fresh and huge...it is awesome!!!! The service and food better than Siam cafe a lot!!!!"}
{"text":"This a neighborhood jewel! Food is delicious and plentful. Hot and sour soup is always perfectly hot and sour. Ask for the Chinese menu for the most authentic preparations...and there's pictures!."}
{"text":"This place puts the best sauce on your food. Shrimp toast is amazing. Wonton soup is average. Fried rice is average. This is a great place though and highly recommended for dinner and a movie."}
{"text":"Giving five stars for the all around experience: exceptional food, staff and service. Two menus to peruse, an authentic Chinese menu or the easy American style, point at pictures type.

Used to never be a fan of hot and sour soup until I tried it here. It's a steal for only $1.50 a bowl! Generous portions of bamboo shoot, tofu and pork make this soup chunky. It's also the generous portion of vinegar that makes my lower mouth start to salivate and keeps me coming back.

For the low carb community, would recommend the mu shu, but specify without noodles. Nice blend of vegetables and meats, enormous portion, comes with a fried egg on top.

Love the owner Mike who has always treated us like family, will sit down and talk with us and never shoo us away.

Parking lot right outside. Also, side tip, ask the chef to use less oil."}
