{"text":"Amazing Southern food & Whiskey bar! You need to come here if you're in Tempe visiting. Complete family owned southern hospitality feeling. Super affordable. \"We want to overfeed you\" - Doreen."}
{"text":"Literally didn't even get a picture of our food because we ate it so fast. This place is amazing. The owner was our waitress and told us how she named the place after her kids! The food and the menu names were great! There also a great band! Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere! Loved the great service and open area air indoor eating! Food was amazing. We will definitely come again. Best country music vibes in town!"}
{"text":"They have a great atmosphere and the place is awesome! An incredibly good variety of beers and great drink specials! Cater to a little older crowd of 25 to 30 and above which is outstanding for us. And the food is outstanding! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I ate here during their soft opening before going to a show at tempe improv and everything was great. Awesome burgers, really fun staff and atmosphere. I'm going back tonight. Haven't seen live music there yet but its a great stage and i imagine the shows are a lot of fun."}
{"text":"First time at Sammy D's and loved it! Live music above the bar, drink specials, and tasty food (we both ordered the chicken fingers). We met the owner, Doreen (pictured) whom is so sweet and definitely easy on the eyes! My roommate and I love dancing so this will be a cool new local spot next to ASU to get our two-steppin on! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cuteeee!!!! Doreene is the best server and has the best drink recommendations! highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to try Sammy D's and I am  all in!  What a great \"Nashville\" feel kinda bar and that doesn't even compare to their food!  O.M.G. I am in  with Cookie (formally known as Kim) the cook!!!! #holyamazingfood If you like it hot, try to he hot mama burger- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"If you are visiting Tempe and love country music make sure to come by this spot. The bartenders make the drinks on point and the food is soooo good and so cheap for the amount you get. The owner was beyond personable, Doreen served us our food and treated my friends like they were the most important people. This spot just opened and I plan on coming again when I visit Arizona!"}
{"text":"So excited there's finally a new country bar in Tempe! The decorations and ambiance of the place is perfect. On top of that, the food was excellent and HUGE portions, and delicious. 50 beers on tap gave plenty to choose from, and the live music was excellent. Definitely will be a regular at this place"}
{"text":"Doreen's makes the best drink , and provides the best service in the absolute world. I have never had an orange juice cocktail like she maid me. Absolutely amazing service and food. I love her !!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Music playing but not too loud. Doreen recommended a delish whiskey (4 Roses) and we had a great conversation with her!  Will be back in a few weeks!  Not a college bar, not pretentious, nice atmosphere and friendly service.   Back for visit 2!  Loved it. Met Matt - the 'other' owner - he's not as attractive as Doreen (haha) but he was friendly and recommended the $5 pizza (delish, thin, chewy crust and plenty for 2) and a whisky flight for hubby and a yummy 3 olives rose w soda for me - my new go-to!  We love it here and though we aren't in this are often we love coming before shows at Gammage etc. We will be back."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on KNIX, and I want this place to succeed, I really really do. But it's gotta work out a few kinks. The server told us its only been open for a couple weeks so any new bar/restaurant has a few kinks to work out. 1. The cocktails need a little work. We had three different cocktails throughout our table, and each drink just wasn't mix well. Luckily for me I'm usually a beer drinker, but I did try one and sample a friends, and the main alcohol ingredient definitely overpowered the rest of the ingredients. The radio ad hyped up the hand-crafted cocktails, so I really hope you all pull through with them.  1.a: if you're gonna have local beers on tap, you need Four Peaks. Just saying ;- ) 2. We already spoke to the owner about this, but it's kinda funny and worth mentioning: they have two different food plates with the same name. My friend ordered their buffalo chicken tenders called the \"Indian Outlaw\", but when the food came out he got  a burger. Upon looking over the menu we discovered there's a burger that's also called the \"Indian Outlaw\". Might wanna change one of those. 3. Does all the fried food really need Parmesan cheese on top? One of our friends is allergic to dairy so they ordered their chicken tenders with a side of fries. Little did we know the fried chicken tenders come topped with Parmesan cheese, so she had to send it back. Just kinda weird, and if all the fried food is going to come topped with cheese of some sort that could be something worth mentioning on the menu.  Ok, something positive: the pretzels and beer cheese were good, along with my \"One Hot Momma\" burger! And I'm really looking forward to the live music on weekends!  Overall though we didn't have a bad experience. It's a new place and the owner took care of us when we expressed our concerns. The Tempe area has been lacking a good country bar since Toby Keith's in Mesa Riverview closed. So this bar is very exciting for me, I'll go back when they get their live music going! Just work out the kinks and know that I really, really do want your place to be a success!"}
{"text":"Wow!! So great we were amazed by the hospitality and the great drinks. I want this bar in Denver! Highly recommend the live bands will be insane.  Love It. Must come here!"}
{"text":"New place and Doreen has a wonderful bar with a great staff. The pizza is phenomenal, the beer is fresh, and the bartender makes a great old fashioned with Woodford reserve!"}
{"text":"Both had a nice experience. Locate right next to the Improv in Tempe they just opened up. Very friendly owners and wait staff, very attentive.  We started out with jalapeno poppers. Much to our surprise they were excellent. Made in house fresh sliced. My wife have the Buffalo flavored cauliflower florets and meatloaf.  She Raved about them.  My favorite was the bar with probably over 40 drafts on tap.  The double steak burger with chili was it good Edition set my beer.   Well worth a visit!"}
