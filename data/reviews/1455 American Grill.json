{"text":"Hubby took me on a date here shortly after opening and my husband ordered wings and a few beers and I had a sandwich, the food was pretty good bit don't go to this place if you have a tight budget! 115 bucks for 2 meals and a few beers. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Nice local watering hole with a good beer selection and decent pub grub. Also family friendly. Very nice staff and fair prices."}
{"text":"This was one of the better burgers we have had in a very long time. The staff is very friendly Amber is a great bartender and waitress.  We were here before the usual night time rush and it was very peaceful"}
{"text":"Ambience is OK, beer selection pretty good.  Food is OK.  Would neither avoid nor enthusiastically recommend.  I would go back, and hope that we caught them on a slow night."}
{"text":"Thought we would try something new, glad we did!! Service was amazing, we had the tri tip beer cheese burger with the most yummy sweet potato fries and I had the pulled pork sliders.  I'm a light eater, my slider appetizer dish was just the right amount. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service and food are dynamite! Ask for Austin, he is super attentive and made sure we were well taken care of. The St. Pat's menu was amazing!"}
{"text":"The owners of this fine establishment started in Mesa with Brick's Family Grill. The food was absolutely sinful and thankfully they have continued that tradition with the new 1455 American Grill. 

The servers are very careful and actually pay attention to the customers. It really won't matter what you order because everything is great.

Lastly a comment on prices. I have seen a few whiners on Facebook about this issue. Yes they are above average prices but your getting high quality food and its always cooked perfectly. If you look around at some of the other more popular burger restaurants they run about the same. Personally I would prefer to pay 12 dollars for a burger and fries that taste amazing consistently. If you have an issue with it go down the street and get some of that cardboard fast food junk."}
{"text":"This was the first time my wife and I came in.  What a great place food was fantastic great beer selection and the service was awesome.  Definitely be back. On a regular basis"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night to get burgers because of the good reviews on Yelp.. I was not disappointed.  The burger had great flavor and was juicy without being greasy.  You can definitely tell the quality of the meat they use from Midwestern Meats.  I had the Beer Cheese and Onion burger and my wife had the Bleu Cheese Burger.  Both were cooked to their correct level of doneness.  The fries were great too, and they have a great list of craft beers, many of which are local.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My niece plays baseball at McQueen Park and we were in search of lunch after her game and stumbled upon this cute place. Service was great, friendly and attentive. We all had burgers which actually came out cooked how we had ordered. Thumbs up! I think they're pretty new but they definitely have already got service and quality food down! Great find!!"}
{"text":"We went in on a Tuesday evening.  The place is nice.  Kind of a brewery atmosphere but this is not a brewery.  Their wine selection was very limited but what they had was good enough.  Bartender said they are getting some new selections.  I believe the place had only been open a couple of weeks.  The food was decent but VERY small portions.  The prices here are really high too.  The craft beer pints cost $6-$8 for the same brands that you would pay about $5/pint elsewhere.  The food prices are really high too.  I understand quality ingredients cost more but I have eaten at a lot of high end restaurants that use high quality ingredients but the portion sizes are more in line with the prices.  I will be back once they have had a chance to settle in a bit.  I will try to hit their happy hour though to keep the cost at least somewhat reasonable."}
{"text":"Had driven past this place many times and finally decided to give it a try. Food was simply amazing. Wedge salad had plenty of bacon and chunks of blue cheese. Green chili burger was the best I have had, and I love green chili so I have had a few! Great selection of craft beers on tap as well as the macros. I recommend the onion straws for your side, thay are amazing as well. Service couldn't be better. We will definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. We really enjoyed the food and the bar had a nice atmosphere too. I could definitely see myself coming back on a Sunday to watch football."}
{"text":"I was expecting more... The wines weren't listed anywhere the server had to verbally tell me I couldn't just look. I thought that was strange."}
{"text":"If you're in North Gilbert, Chandler, Mesa you NEED to come & check this place out. Great craft beer selection & full bar. Friendly & efficient staff. And the FOOD! A little something for everyone at a level that transcends your average bar food! Truly good eats. If you're lucky, the owner will drop by your table with a little treat/ taste of something he is tinkering around with in the kitchen. A must try!"}
{"text":"Always loved the burgers but last burger I ordered from there was terrible . I ordered it medium and it was so rare the blood was squeezing out of it. I took it to go and didn't want to bring it back. I should have complained,I even took a picture of it but I just pulled the meat out of the bun a nuked it. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar. They're always rotating craft beers on tap and the food is excellent. A great place to hang out and enjoy the specials."}
{"text":"A friend and I we looking for a place to watch the game and we ended up here. It actually worked out really well. The place was pretty empty which doesn't speak to how good it was. The tap list was pretty impressive. I'm not a big beer drinker but my friend had a few favorites that aren't the easiest to find. They had a cider and hard root beer on tap though which I was really happy with. The spinach dip we got was delicious and my friend's burger was huge. I got a crispy chicken salad and the chicken was good but I wasn't really impressed with the rest. I honestly I was attempting to be a bit healthier but didn't really want the salad. So I will definitely coming back for really food!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. 
The verdict is in and everything was awesome from the service to the food! Everything is fresh made and not frozen right down to the mozzarella stick. Which are best I've had in a long time. Our server was Austin and he was great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar especially for the Island community! The atmosphere is cool, relaxed and great music (no techno new age Katie perry crap) the staff is awesome, friendly and knows their beer! It's a well done rustic American decor, plenty of tvs but not overwhelming to watch a good game. The food is high quality, hand made, and uses the freshest ingredients. There are over 20 beers on tap, food for everyone to enjoy from meat eaters to vegetarian options. Our favorite is the hand breaded Mozzarella sticks, caprese sandwhich and the onion straws. You're paying for the quality of good food, no complaints here. If you're tired of bland average bar food, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Was looking for a restaurant in the area with two hungry kids in the car and were pleasantly surprised to find this place. The area is a little deserted, but the ambiance is clean, cuter than most sports bar, and the food did not disappoint. Service was great, accommodating and attentive, food was much much better and fresher than what you would find in like places. Had a buffalo chicken sandwich, my husband had a giant burger and was raving about it! You can tell this place is individually owned and small bizz so I give it 5 in hopes more people will come and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Heard how good the food was from a few people so when my son wanted to try something new with a good burger for his birthday I yelped best burgers and American Grill was on the list. This place won't disappoint- everything is fresh. Their appetizers aren't frozen - like the mozzarella sticks. Effort went in to make them hand breaded and full of flavor! My son gave the burger 5 stars & I give the tri-tip beer cheese sandwich with au jus 5 stars as well. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu that says tri-tip, and the beer cheese is to die for! The waitress was awesome and happily amd efficiently took care of 8-10 tables alone smiling the entire time. The kitchen sent our table a huge dessert chocolate chip cookie hot out of the oven smothered in vanilla bean ice cream. How awesome is it that not only your waitress welcomes you and appreciates the business but the kitchen acknowledged it too! Great food, great service, 1455 American grill won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Anything I have ever ordered from here has been amazing and the service has always been great! I really like that they have gluten free options."}
{"text":"First the good: The Host/Waitress was nice and attentive and the food was good. 
The not so good: Our table was dirty. The Host apologized and went to get a rag and cleaned it. The music was WAY too loud and it was metal music from the 80's. I don't want MTV blaring while I eat!  We normally just get water to drink and when it came, it tasted horrible! The waitress got us more from a different source and it was better, but still not very good. Makes me wonder if this is a ploy to get customers to buy drinks.
Bottom line: we will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Our favorite is the Ruben. We have had rubens in other places and we look at each other and say\"does not compare to 1455. Atmosphere, attention to our needs and their salad is amazing. 
Service has always been great. The chef is on top of things and greets us when we walk in. The waitress is especially attentive and not pushy.
Thank you to all that makes our dining and drinking experience special."}
{"text":"We're always on the look-out for a good bar and grill place to watch a game and get some good food/beer. We decided to try this place, even though the parking lot was pretty empty and it didn't appear open.  However, when we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised.  The decor of the place was simple, yet very clean and welcoming.  There wasn't a host to seat us, only the bartender telling us from behind the bar to grab an open seat, which was fine with us because we were immediately greeted by her when we walked in.  The craft beer selection was decent, with good happy hour prices (around $4.50 for my husband's favorite Kilt Lifter).  We ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, which were on the happy hour menu.  As an extreme pickle fan, they were some of the BEST fried pickles I've ever had!  They were fresh, seasoned well and super tasty.  We then shared the reuben sandwich and fries, which was delicious as well.  Overall, we were very impressed with this place and will definitely go back again.  The service was fantastic and the food was great."}
{"text":"We were told to try this out by friends of ours and we are glad we did.  Great burgers!  Rings and garlic fries were sinfully good!"}
{"text":"Great place. Awesome food and tons of good beers on tap. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the hamburgers and they were very good, you could tell that the meat was fresh and not frozen. Our server was great!"}
{"text":"I recommend this place for food, but the drinks were pricey. My husband ordered a four peaks pumpkin porter for $7 and we've paid $5 at other places. The food was prepared perfectly. The service was amazing. The ambiance was comfortable and inside was clean. Our bill with two kids and two adults, two beers, and an app was $78. So I was a little bummed, but it may be better for a date night than a place to bring a family because of the cost. So we'll be back, but not with the kids ."}
{"text":"The burger was excellent, the wings were meaty, and the service was quick and good. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Good first visit! Will be back! Had a very attentive server. Good atmosphere, not too loud as a different nearby bar can sometimes be--so it was family friendly the night we were there. Food was solid, and I really liked the Tri-tip sandwich. Could use a bit more seasoning on the fried pickles but they were still good, and the horseradish was a little tame for my taste...but those are just personal preferences. All in all a great new place!"}
{"text":"This place will not disappoint! It is such good food with great service. It is not typical bar food but you can get it if you want. Just be prepared to have their homemade from scratch versions that will keep you wanting more. 
Their specials are delicious like  Rib eye steaks and beer can chicken. 
Also they have Gluten free options so GF community mark this spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. 
We ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and the artichoke dip. Everything tastes good! 
The staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Our waitress Kay was amazing. We will be back for sure. The prices were not to crazy at all. For an appetizer we got the Mozzarella Sticks and Tri-Tip and Beer Cheese on Crostini. Both were amazing. We both ordered a burger and split them. My wife got the Beer Cheese Burger and I got the BBQ Burger. We split them and they were amazing. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Absolutely amazing service with food to match. Had the Beer cheese burger. Absolutely incredible! I am a new fan and will be a regular!

Update. Have been back a few times now. I still love the food. Some observations: 1.) Bar stools and bar table stools are not too comfortable. 2.) Prices are pretty high for 2 people. Don't be surprised when 2 burgers w/fries and 4 tap beers (2 each) comes to $60 before the tip. Tip 15% or better and you are looking at $70   3.) Burgers requested to be cooked medium are consistently medium-well to well. You must request medium rare for any pink. 3.) Sweet potato fries were soggy compared to regular fries. 4.) The beer cheeseburger is the best burger 5.) Service is consistently above and beyond most restaurants. 6.) Cleanliness is a staple here.

Was hoping to make this my regular spot since I am so close. But with the prices, it will be a once and a while place to get great burger and great service."}
{"text":"I was a regular at the Brick's location.  I liked the sports bar feel and returned often with family and friends for the food and beer.  Jim is an excellent chef and you won't be disappointed with anything you choose on the menu. I returned with a friend last night to watch MNF.  We sat at the bar and ordered a couple beers, shared a dozen wings, and each ordered a main course. I had the Ruben and side salad, which was delicious.  Service was excellent.  

But...  

The place doesn't have the same \"Cheers\" vibe I felt at Bricks. Atmosphere felt cold. Lighting was too bright and seats were uncomfortable. Sat at the high top in the bar and my back hurt by second quarter. Old favorites like ribs, grilled cheese, quesadillas, and nachos are no longer on menu. Prices also seem to have increased."}
{"text":"Service amazing, and burgers are amazing, chicken tenders could be bigger for a meal, but delicious!!! Hidden away a bit, but worth finding!!!!!!"}
{"text":"On our second visit,  burger was still a delicious, juicy 5 star. It would be hard to beat this burger anywhere!  We ordered slaw instead of Fries. It was a plate full of fresh and tasty.  

The wife had the Cobb salad. It too was big and tasty but there wasn't anything particularly memorable for her to give it a 5 star. 

We also had the pretzel with beer cheese appetizer. Cheese is served cold but it tasted good. 4.5 for those"}
{"text":"Had the classic with bacon, medium well, .....like? OH MAH GaH!! O.o what a very tasty burger. Definitely coming back when I'm craving a 'juicy' burger. The appetizer was also a delicious tasty taste, blue corn chips and artichoke dip. My oh my! You make my tummy happy :)"}
{"text":"Beer selection is basic, beers you would find anywhere...absolutely nothing special.
Pretzels and cheese were AWESOME! (the only reason I have 2 stars instead of 1)
I had beer can chicken...was luke warm, super tough and was defintely reheated (had that weird reheated poultry taste). The taste was somewhere between Indian and weird. 
Gorzonzola potatoes were really good, but dry as well.
Hubby had gorgonzola burger and really liked it."}
{"text":"Small place, good beer selection, good service, but the food is so so.. I ordered a steak medium rare and got it medium, my sides were kinda cold.. I'd come back for the salads over anything else."}
{"text":"Wow. Great food, amazing atmosphere, and just great people. Very cool. Food is to die for."}
{"text":"The tail end of Sunday Funday..............our last stop.

Sat down at the bar and the staff was awesome. Attentive, chatty, great knowledge of the menu, and an AWESOME beer selection.
Had the habanero burger and it.....was.....awesome. 
 So, 1455 you have scored a couple of locals for your bar and we wish you luck!!  We need something in this area to call \"our place\"
Keep us the good work, we'll be back, over and over again!!

See you soon!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, love that they have beer cheese and their Parmesan fries are the best! Awesome craft beer selection, super friendly staff and everything we ordered was delicious!"}
{"text":"I recommend this place based on the quality of the food and service. 1455 offers juicy burgers, friendly service and an industrial interior design. 
The ingredients are definitely high quality. I had a burger, my wife had a tri-tip. We were both pleased. Most the seating is made up of 4-seater booths (in the restaurant section and pub tables in the bar section. We sat at the booths. 1455 has televisions displaying sports but the booths, walls are high and the tvs are situated so that you really need to sit near the bar to comfortably see them any way. There was an outdoor section that overlooked the parking-lot. The prices for some of the food, like our parmesan fries, were a little high for the quantity provided.
The wait, for their grand opening, was worth it but I probably won't be able to frequent this place as often (based on the price.) This will be more of a weekend restaurant than a cheaper weekday restaurant. 

****Update****
I have not, yet, been back for another try but I did just get a tip from another yelper.

\"They now have a lunch menu that will beat any other prices as well! Check out their Facebook page for the menu. I'm sure you will be pleased with the prices and the food.\"

So I will check out their lunch menu and see what we see."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, absolute best burger in town. Beer selection is awesome and service A+. Can't wait to try the fish and other menu items. This chef obviously knows what he is doing!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are usually Red Robin lovers but tonight we decided to try something new. I am SO glad we did. Our sever, Kay was friendly and attentive, the beer selection is excellent and most of all, our burgers were amazing!!! The bun was perfect and the patty was juicy and delicious. We both agreed that these were the best burgers we've had in years. Highly, highly recommend this local gem!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  Everything is delicious!  Wings, chicken strips, salad ... amazing!  My favorite is their burgers though.  Beef is fresh, you can really taste a difference.  Habanero burger is my favorite.  Make sure to try the garlic parmesan french fries!  Service has always been great aw well.  I don't understand why this place isn't always slammed!"}
{"text":"A cut above your average burger joint. Entrees were very good. The owner is also the chef, per our waiter.  Friendly staff, relaxed environment.  This new restaurant deserves to do well."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because I live nearby but I wasn't too impressed. Maybe you have to eat it there rather than get it to go like I did. When I called to place my order I felt really rushed and she seemed bothered. I knew what I wanted to order but this was my first time trying this place. We ordered 2 burgers and the steak and cheese sandwich with side salads instead of fries. The salad was right under the sandwich in the to go box so it was warm and the lettuce was limp. We were worried about the lettuce being warm so we didn't eat the salads. However, the burger and steak quality were fairly decent. The onion strings were a little raw still and the buns were a bit mushy. It is my birthday but I have an injury so I couldn't make it to eat inside anywhere so we figured it was close by and we'd give it a try. I was hoping maybe for a free birthday dessert like most places offer but was told they don't do anything for birthdays."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. The staff was very friendly and the food was very good meat comes from a local source it's nice to see people supporting local companies if they keep up the good work I expect to see them expanding to a larger building"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this review is not as positive as my previous review.  We were there one time between my previous review and this one and did not have a good experience but I thought they deserved another chance.  But this time was even worse.  We ordered the 1455 sliders, which we were told we could do even though they were no longer on the menu, and they didn't even resemble what they used to be.  It used to be 3 sliders, so three good size medallions of steak with onions and mushrooms and this time it was two very thin pieces of meat on a hamburger bun cut in half.  We were okay with the hamburger bun because we were warned but last time it was cut into three pieces so we still got the same amount of meat as the original sliders.  I would be embarrassed to serve the thin small pieces of meat at all, let alone two instead of three.  I asked for mushrooms to be on the side so they decided to also put the onions on the side in the mushroom bowl.  They obviously don't think about allergies or follow what the customer wants.  I upgraded my fries to onion strings which usually are delicious but this time they were cold, crispy, but cold.  I don't mind an upcharge but please do not charge me more money for something that is supposed to be hot and served cold.  The server gave up on us as soon as a table of blond women came in.  This was their last chance.  There are too many other places to spend our money."}
{"text":"Staff was amazing and the food was incredible!!! So glad to live in The Islands and be a short bike ride away from 1455!!!"}
{"text":"Food is mostly frozen food reheated. Pretty much crap. Ok beer selection. NOTHING SPECIAL about guys place. I  go to others in the area that are SO MYCH better & cheaper."}
{"text":"They have some of the best burgers around.  Half brisket half beef.  What a combo.  Several specials and the beer can chicken is another favorite.  Great selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area so it was our first time trying this place and I'm happy to say it's going to be our new favorite  local bar.  We got the blue cheese burger and the habanero burger and both were awesome.  The garlic fries and sweet potato fries for great as well. Good selection of craft beers. Service was great. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Giving 3 stars because the service was great and some of the food was good. Burger - ordered medium well and got medium rare. Water was unfiltered and tasted bad so I asked for a club soda with one piece of lime and lemon. Was told they're out of lime - really??? Club soda tasted horrible. Yes some places I've been to have unfiltered water that taste bad but usually club soda taste good. This place had unfiltered club soda. I'm glad I did t order vodka & club soda like I normally would. Don't they want to make sure their alcoholic drinks taste better for the customers? 
Fries are too thick. Some were thicker than my thumb. 
They had the side door opened and cigarettes smoke was coming inside. One of the customers next to us had to walk to the side and close the door herself. 
Not sure about the place altogether. There're too many good places to eat at and this place didn't stand out much for me, and the taste of water & club soda was the deal breaker."}
{"text":"I'm going to give four stars because I want to see this place do well as I live in the neighborhood, but I do have a couple reservations.

First, the good stuff. The food was amazing. We ordered two entrees and an appetizer. All of it was delicious and reasonably priced. The ambiance is interesting for a bar. It's less of your typical dark sports bar and more bright and airy. It was exceptionally clean. The staff was quick and attentive. Their food game is on point.

Now, the alcoholic beverage component. They have a ton of beers on draft, but oh buddy, are you going to pay for it. I know it isn't cheap to keep a large portfolio of beers on draft such as they do, but one beer in particular I ordered was $8 for a pint. For a *pint*. Even their cheaper brews are still over $5 for a pint. It seems hard to justify those prices when you can go a couple blocks down the road to a certain other microbrewery and pay significantly less for just about anything on their beer menu. 

Now, it's not a huge deal, but this probably isn't the place you want to go to drink excessively, because it will get expensive quick. If you want to get trashed on Sunday while watching the game, ehh, this probably isn't ideal. Additionally, perhaps consider reevaluating some of your beer offerings. I understand the appeal of offering an exotic and obscure beer menu, however when my wife requested a Blue Moon or a Shock Top, she had to settle for the Four Peaks white ale. Maybe consider a few more \"mainstream\" beers. Also, perhaps consider printing your beer menu. If you're sitting in a booth at the other end of the restaurant, the chalkboard menu is difficult to see.

Overall, it's a great place and I will be back. It's super convenient having a bar that I can literally walk to that has great food. Far too often, at bars around here, you have to suffer through subpar food. Not so, here. I wish them success!"}
{"text":"Great new local place doing soft opening. The staff is very friendly and service is great. Firecracker shrimp & 1455 sliders were delicious. Full bar and good selection of beer. Sorry about the tap. 
Good luck with the grand opening October 22. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Came here because we had a gift card. Very friendly staff. Didn't come over every second to make sure you were okay but didn't forget about you either. Great service and fun atmosphere. The wedge salad and tator tots were awesome. I'd come back to try the burgers."}
{"text":"First time coming and we will definitely be back! When I crave a burger, this is what my taste buds crave! Lots of choices, great flavors, friendly staff and crispy fries. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. $8 for a pint of adult root beer is kind of ridiculous considering San Tan and Wilderness brewery are right down the street and have lunch specials. $22 for an over cooked burger and adult root beer at lunch, noon. Disappointed since we work down the street and we're looking for a new lunch spot. Place is over priced. No specials. Mediocre service when it only had maybe 12 customers in there. Asked for burger medium rare, came out well done and over peppered. Ate half of it. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Great service and they have tater tots! The food and beer selection were plenty as was the service. The place was not busy for a Saturday, this worked in our favor for a party of 6!"}
{"text":"Great food and a nice selection of beers. 
Our waiter (Jesse) was awesome. 
We had a great time. 
Nice place for a family dinner or to get a couple of drinks. 
Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was tasty and the serving sizes xlg. Nice place!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time trying this place ! Well deserved 5 stars ! It is family friendly. The atmosphere is comfortable and quiet. Clean restaurant great wait staff. Chris served us tonight he was amazing. We will definitely be returning! 
My wife's burger was very juicy even tho she ordered it well done! Being pregnant and all!! 
I ordered the filet medium rare and it was cooked perfect! 
Onion strings were great as well as the fries, mozzarella sticks and chicken strips all very well prepared!"}
{"text":"I really appreciate the vibe here and the mix between respectable regulars and the infusion of the dining room.. it's like being at home with no divide.. it's that humble holiday feeling which I appreciate.. I have been to plenty of bars/restaurant and they just have yet to intermix the two so great job! My bartender/server was doing it all! I believe her name was Kay and she had a good looking older women with her I did not catch her name but she was also moving and grooving as well so much props to those two.. the kitchen was flowing great and had no issues with my ticket time so much appreciated the open window let's me see them hustling which I appreciate even if I was waiting a little!! But that type of service I will definitely spread the word I wish the best for the future of this business and the employees whom are making this happen!!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise. Have patronized most of the restaurants in downtown Gilbert and Chandler, and this little place has quality as good or better than any of those places without the overcrowding and overpricing of those downtown locations. Strip center location a bit out of the mainstream but conveniently close to McQueen park facilities and plenty of close parking.  Have had the hamburgers, southwest chicken sandwich and wings on various visits. All were good quality and freshly made. Ordered burgers medium rare and well and both were done as ordered. Meat is high quality. Lettuce and tomato were crisp and fresh, not limp like some other places. Wings were some of the best I have had. The sauce was spiced as it should be. The wings were not soggy but were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside and were the meatiest wings I have had in a long time. Good authentic neighborhood tavern ambiance. It is  possible to carry on a conversation without yelling. Not extremely large, but pretty good craft beer selection. Only down side is the selection did not include any lagers or pilsners, which hit the spot on a hot day. Good for families, but not sure they can accommodate really large parties. Best of all, this is NOT A CHAIN. It is locally owned and the owners are on the premises. The East Valley needs to support these kind of businesses when they produce good quality like this so we don't end up being limited to a bunch of mediocre corporate chain restaurants and fast food places."}
{"text":"Pork green chili, wedge salad and good beer. Place is new, clean and staff is super nice."}
{"text":"Drove by here for a while ... finally tried it. Great burger and GREAT customer service ... the owners are fantastic.  Wings were delish, beer was cold. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. Tastes like they make everything in house. Beer was amazing. Service was the best, never had to ask for anything. Attentive. 10/10 would eat here again. Nick was an awesome server. My husband and I ordered the blue cheese burger with tots and it was fabulous! My daughters boyfriend got the habanero burger and Nick did say it was 'hot' and it was, but still great. Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"I love this place. Is it pricey..yes. But is it worth every penny... YES! Our burgers were huge and cooked perfectly. The wings were crispy and flavorful. Our drinks were never empty and the staff was so welcoming. It's the top of our date night list every time."}
{"text":"Our family of 6 dined here this weekend. We are in town buying a house- from Ca. So happy we stumbled upon this place! Our server was sweet as could be, chatted up my 4 year old and never let our needs go unmet. They burgers were delicious, the beer was cold, Parmesan fries were killer- even the babies grilled cheese and tots was killer! They've got a good thing going on here, can't wait to visit more regularly!"}
{"text":"Don't let the boring name or dark decor scare you away! We were actually going to the sandwich shop next door, but they were having their floor cleaned. The guy cleaning the floor came out as we were deciding where to go instead and suggested this place. 

The menu didn't seem to appeal to my family, so we all reluctantly ordered a safe choice of a cheeseburger. Oh my... I have been craving their burger since we walked out! They use grass fed beef from Iowa, part chuck and part brisket and you can order it cooked medium or even rare if that's how you like it! I may have to do medium well next time as the medium rare was a bit too red and juicy and my bottom bun got soggy. But seriously, is a juicy burger something to complain about? I'll be back next time I have a hankering for some red meat. 

Thanks Sidewinders for cleaning your floors! (Don't worry, we will still patronize your establishment for sandwiches)."}
{"text":"Poor Service & food taste like it's all basic frozen food. 3rd time here. Really tried to like it. TOO MANY GREAT places around."}
{"text":"The southwest chicken sandwich is divine! Perfectly balanced! Real fries, not frozen. Yum! So glad this place is down the street from us!"}
{"text":"We walked in and were immediately greeted (good).  She grabbed menus and when I said we were a party of five she said oh, sit wherever you'd like and if you need to push some tables together you can do that (not good).  She then proceeds to walk away with the menus.  Why would I need to push tables together?  You are a full service restaurant, yes?  Why wouldn't YOU push some tables together?  So we stand there awkwardly as there are no tables large enough to accommodate our party of five unless we push two together.  Finally another young lady comes over and asks if we need help and agrees to clean off a table that was large enough for us and didn't require us to rearrange their furniture.  So not a great start.  The food was good although it took a bit to get to us.  I'd say it was worth the wait, however.  I was disappointed to see a 35cent charge for the extra ranch dressing I asked for.  Not that the 35cent was the end of the world, but I'm not a fan of places that nickel and dime you.  Overall, I wouldn't rush to get back here.  Had the experience been better, I might have as the food was worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Nothing really to recommend.  I asked for a well done burger which the cook took to mean burned and dry.  French fries okay.  Kinda of pricey for nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The beer cheese was amazing. Not traditional beer cheese, very garlicky and delicious. The burger was so juicy and delicious. I got the green chili burger.  One of the best burgers I have ever tasted.  I got the Parmesan garlic fries and my husband got the onion strings, both were amazing. Will go here again. So yummy."}
{"text":"Woah. Talk about flavor - I loved this place! Came here with my mom and her friend while they were visiting from out of town and they wanted \"burgers.\" After looking around on Yelp, I found this place and decided to give it a try. I was a bit skeptical based on some of the pics... but SO glad we came by to give it a try.  

Preview: Food flavorful, delicious and most definitely worthwhile - burgers are a MUST. We were a bit disappointed about the service (see the rest for the details!) 

The atmosphere was different than we thought. It was a nice restaurant type place but it had some rocking music like a bar almost. It wasn't overwhelming though. 

The menu was a good size with a variety of what appeared to be tasty options to choose from. We all got burgers. We got a Guacamole Bacon Burger, Bleu Cheese Burger, and Beer Cheese Burger. The burger was a perfect size and hand crafted and it came with a good portion of fries. The fries were crispy and delicious. BUT OMG THE BURGERS! The meat was so flavorful, I wanted to ask so bad how they made them, we all thought they were delicious. The toppings were also smothered and amazing. The guacamole on mine was flavorful w/ the pico and it was heaven. I heard great things about the Bleu Cheese and Beer Burger as well. The toppings were plentiful and delicious. These are a MUST!

To finish off the meal we got the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie w/ ice cream... this thing was HUGE! For how much we got and for the price it was delicious and a steal. You definitely need 2-3 people to eat this at least. 

My only disappointment was with the service. Our server stopped by once to fill our drinks but otherwise the bartender was on point with food delivery and refills. It may have been an off day but I was really disappointed. Had she been a little more attentive and we weren't waiting around this would have been an EASY 5 stars! The restaurant wasn't that busy when we went, maybe 3-4 other tables of 2-3 people each. 

OVERALL: YOU MUST TRY THEIR BURGERS! If not everything else on the menu. Looking forward to coming back here again! :D It is worth the stop."}
{"text":"Came in last minute with the kids and I think the food is good beer list is good food as well.  The chicken fingers look made by hand!  Service was also good.  

I think the location is difficult for them it is in the middle of gilberts Bible Belt if you know what I mean.  

Give it a try if you like good beer on tap not your run of the mill crap but good beer and good food you will like it!"}
{"text":"delicious! we stumbled upon this place on accident, we originally we going to try out Zinburger in down town Gilbert but it was an hour and a half wait, with a 16month old we were not waiting.  So instead we found this place and I'm soo happy we did!  not crowded at all, very clean, and the staff was very personable!  ordered some mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers for the kiddo to start, you can tell everything was homemade and tasted soo good! the kiddo ate a nice big plate.  the bacon cheeseburger was juicy and just perfect, I suggest the onion straws on the side they were delicious!  the filet was cooked perfectly, tender and really really good!  their French fries are also really good, some of the best I've had at a restaurant .  finally don't forget to try the skillet cookie for dessert, one word Wow!  so happy we found this place, will Definitely return!...Ooo and their beef is grass fed and all comes from one butcher!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great! Maybe they should serve alil but more on the fries but all is good !"}
{"text":"Hadn't been in awhile and pleasantly surprised. Great taps!  Food was really good. Mushroom Swiss burger and avail on a gluten free bun. Asian salad was terrific. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Easily one of the better burgers I have had in a really long time. I just stopped by for lunch last week and hopped up to the bar. It was great, nice and quiet spot. 

I got their BBQ burger and it was cooked perfectly, the BBQ sauce they used was great and not overpowering, the fries cooked perfectly. No complaints at all. Everything here was quality and I enjoyed the food a lot.

Would absolutely reccomend a stop in here."}
{"text":"There is good vibes in this bar, nice interior and service. Good beers on tap, some domestics are bottle only. Did not have bud light and Guinness on tap. Will be back there again, but to be honest.... the food was not that good. I sent back a $9 wedge salad and the $15 jalapeño burner tasted like it was grilled on something that had previously burned. I did order some fried pickles that were tasty. Still...pricey for the results. 

A place I'll definitely go for drinks in support of this small business, but I'll think twice about what food I might order."}
{"text":"This has become my boyfriend's regular Friday-happy-hour-haunt. They have a great beer list, make a great margarita, and we love the food. What really sends this place over the top is the great selection of gluten-free food and beer. We have a friend who is Celiac (real gluten allergy... not the trendy kind), and it's nice to be able to invite him and know he will have options!"}
{"text":"Great family friendly place to eat!!  My husband and I ate there last nights. The taco soup was amazing- I understand it was the first soup of the fall season.  The atmosphere was so pleasant, the music was great, and the food was delicious!!  The ribs and the beer can chicken are a must try. My husband had garlic mashed potatoes; mine had cheese.   Both were great.  
If you are hungry, head for this gem!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a mushroom burger with bacon for takeout.  When I got home, the bacon was missing, but I was charged for it on the receipt.  When I called to let them know, I was told the next burger would be on the house.  A few days later, I placed another takeout order for my free burger, plus wings and an appetizer.  Rather than comp my burger, they comp'd my appetizer, which was $5 cheaper.  It was a total BAIT & SWITCH!

Also, when I placed the order, I asked if I can get 2 different flavors on the 12 count wings, to which they said yes.  Instead of charging me for 12 wings, they charged me for two 6 count wings, which is more expensive.  Who does this???  Normally, I would let something like this slide, but when added to the bait & switch they pulled on me for the burger, this was extremely annoying.  

I'm giving 2 stars because the food is okay (not great, just okay).  Otherwise, would've only given 1 star.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. So terribly disappointed after reading so many great reviews. There were four of us. The children's steak was supposed to have some pink and was dead. There was absolutely no seasoning on it, it was literally a piece of meat on a plate with fries. The buffalo beer chicken was so dry it wasn't even edible. The broccoli was supposed to be sautéed, it was steamed and the mashed potatoes were terrible. The bbq burger and buffalo chicken sandwich were a greasy mess. You couldn't even see the bun on the bottom and the grease was dripping off the burger. My son always finishes his burger and he didn't even eat half. The prices are astronomical. We could've eaten at Zinburger for quality food and the same price. The only thing good was the service. Definitely won't be back most certainly won't recommend."}
{"text":"I wish I had something great to say about this place.... We've gone there a few times (only because it's walking distance from our house). Every time we go, we're irritated about it and say we won't go again!!! The food and drinks are okay.... It's just crazy expensive for what you get!!! $60. for two drinks and some wings... Are you kidding me??? They are priced like a high end North Scottsdale pub, not like a local Gilbert neighborhood bar. A happy hour there would be great, as well as a kid menu. I'm hopeful that if they can stay open they'll eventually improve and we can enjoy our local bar /restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place! Clean, warm, inviting environment. Variety of sports on many TVs. Joy was extremely pleasant and provided great service. Nice local beer selection. The burger was amazing and cooked to perfection. Highly recommended and will be returning! Please come support your local businesses"}
{"text":"Such a find if you live in the Islands or any where around. Solid draft selection, good food and great service. I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Very convenient neighborhood bar & grill. Food was spot on and very tasty. A true American local place with authentic food cooked the way it should be."}
