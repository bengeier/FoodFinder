{"text":"I can't even believe my first visit left me on the fence for a 4-star review. This place was a definite 5 star on my latest visit, I would give it 6 if they let me!  We realized, the fish entree was not for our family. We love carbs too much to deal with fish and a variety of veggie sides.  For our appetizers 3 of us shared the fried brussel sprouts and the mussels in a white coconut based sauce. The mussels were cooked very well, and the brussel sprouts were unbridled (which I enjoyed) so they had a burnt char. They were covered in an incredible, slightly spicy, vinaigrette with roasted peanuts. The peanuts added a great depth even if you don't like them.  For our mains we got 2 orders of seafood paella and 1 order of the scallops with beet risotto and apple slaw. The beet risotto was a pleasant surprise. I had the notion it would be earthy and rich, but it was so savoury and cheesy. It was so lovely pared with the tart apple slaw. And the paella, oh my goodness, to die for. The seafood was plentiful, rice was al dente, spices were on point. Best I've had in the area.   For dessert I got the lindt chocolate mousse and my partners got the creme brulle. I only tried the mousse and it was so light and chocolaty, but not too chocolaty. I ended up eating the whole thing.  And finally service. Service was incredible. He was patient, answered all our questions and just seemed to enjoy his job.   I will definitely go back, preferably on a Tuesday night where you can bring your own wine and they wave the corking fee (you can do this all year round and they charge a $25 corking fee) !!!"}
{"text":"Fav local restaurant. The restaurant is small yet so chic. We love going here whether it's a Tuesday night dinner or Saturday night with the friends. Food is delicious and Omid that works there always ensures we have a great experience with the best service. Order the whole fish and they bone it right there table side and it's amazing to see how they get all the bones out without touching the fish with their actual hands."}
{"text":"First trip to Aurora location.   Food was AMAZING, really.  Service was great, and the atmosphere is great too.  However, the wine list is bizarre.  My friends and I are not award winning wine critics, but we do have preferences.  The wine list is entirely made up of Portuguese wine, which is great if you are a fan, but if you are not, there is literally no other option.   The server did his best to relate us to some bottles we might like, at a mid-price point ($65-70?)  but they weren't to our tastes.      It would be nice if they offered some standard regional choices like California, Australia or Italy.  Keep up the good work in the kitchen!!  I hope they do well, we are short of good food like this in the area."}
{"text":"Great drinks, food and service! We will definitely be back. I got the blueberry mojito, and it is my new favourite drink. We shared the Brussels sprouts for an appetizer-amazing. Then I got the chicken for dinner and it was so tender and delicious. A bit pricey, but so good!"}
{"text":"We've tried Fishbone in Stouffville which was good. Tonight we're having a birthday party and this Aurora restaurant is very nice. Really nice decor. Love the retractable door to let the fresh air in. Great service. The food is fantastic. This restaurant is a winner!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight and it was great! Our server was great and we had to be out by a certain time since there was a reservation coming in but we never felt rushed.  I had the caesar salad and shrimp taco, both amazing! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner at Fishbone. We love the one in Stouffville and this location doesn't disappoint either. My husband absolutely loves their scallops and this time I ordered the same too. The atmosphere is a bit more hip and happening than the other location. The service is friendly and attentive. It's great to have a place like this up in this neck of the woods. Can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with 4 of my girlfriends.  We all liked the food but was not impressed with the lunch menu.  It is essentially the dinner menu with a couple of appetizers added in. Appetizers are too small for a full lunch.  The prices for the entrees for lunch are pricey $22-30. Soup of the day is $8, for lunch! They do not serve bread for lunch but the prices are the same as for dinner. Will not be back for lunch .  Better places out there. Felt ripped off."}
{"text":"Came here for 2 occasions and both times service and food was consistent.  Overall, its a nice place with good service and comfortable atmosphere.    Food Quality of food is good and fresh.  Presentation of the food is always nice.  I had the grilled whole fish which they helped me debone after it was served.  Although unique, I wasn't wowed by the taste.  Maybe I didn't know how to appreciate fish in that style.  On a separate occasion, I tried the stuffed calamari.  The idea was good but it was a bit too salty that I couldn't finish it.  Apart from their entress, I tried a variety of appetizers with the rest of my group, nothing really stood out expect for maybe the poutine.  However, the poutine was removed from the menu on my second visit.  See pics for food ordered.    Service I have to say that service makes up for the food.  They are attentive and will refill water and check up on you as needed.  They are very clear in describing the menu and offering suggestions. On 1 occasion, the waitress told us the wrong number of servings for an appetizer dish and as result, we ordered more than what we needed.  They offered it on the house since it was their error.  Also, we were celebrating a birthday and the waitress overheard so they treated us to a dessert wine which is nice."}
{"text":"Selection is good for us carnivores but not as much if you are a vegetarian. I had the whole fish. It was great. They prepare at your table. Perfectly done. Service was excellent. The chocolate mousse was a perfect ending. Indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the other locations in Stouffville and Musselman's Lake so no surprise I like this location also. Full disclosure - The owner is an acquaintance. We showed up without a reservation on a whim (not recommended) and the maitre'd graciously found us some bar seating. A great spot for seeing the kitchen in action. The bartender was a complete card but totally professional and kept us entertained. The wait staff were on the ball and certainly hustle.  The food as in the other locations is Portuguese themed and the wine is all from Portugal (Yes, Portugal has some exceptional wine) but the cocktails are completely international. I had the braised octopus on Mediterranean vegetables. Exceptional but probably only for the adventurous at heart. Everyone in our group raved about their selections. The space is quite large and tastefully upscale. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant, everything from service to food was quite good for suburbia.  There were four of us and we shared 4 appetizers (grilled octopus, lamb ribs, crab cakes, mussels) and 2 payellas as mains. The crab cakes and mussels were excellent, lamb ribs had very tasty sauce but were overdone, octopus was a bit dry. Payellas were good but I had better. The restaurant has good selection of wines but we went for Belgian beers, I had Laffe Blond which is one of my favorite beers. Overall, solid 4 stars. Probably isn't worth the drive if you are not within 15 min from Aurora."}
{"text":"I had the brussel sprouts for appetizers and the grilled sea bass for dinner and both were delicious! Loved the ambiance and the wait staff were excellent. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"First time at this place since its changed hands from chinook. Really really good. Finally a good restaurant in the area. Admittedly, we went on Valentine's Day for dinner (which tests any establishment) but apart from the slow start with service, the food was pretty amazing.   Oysters were fresh and tasty. My rule is if I see duck confit on the menu - i have to have it - and it didn't disappoint. My table mates ordered steak and cod. All were pretty happy with everything.   This place would have no problem rubbing elbows with the big boys in the city for sure. I'm glad they're here though. Great interior - decor - food speaks for itself. Thanks for the fun night!!"}
{"text":"We booked for family Christmas dinner and the space was lovely. I was concerned as one in the party was not fond of fish regretfully the only thing on the menu they could eat was pizza. We had hoped for steak but were told it had to be served medium rare and that would not work. The Brussel sprouts appetizer was exceptional! So were the fries. Be sure to order! The service was pretty slow ( took us 3 hours for 6 of us). Our main courses were good and the presentation was great. The wine list and beers were all Portuguese. It would have been nice to have more choice."}
{"text":"Came down to Fishbone Kitchen and Grill for a business lunch. It's light, airy and beautifully decorated. The hostess and server were very nice and sat us promptly. We ordered a variety of things, and the general consensus was positive. I ordered the lamb bolognese, and it was delicious and filling.  It did take a bit of time for the food to come out, and since we didn't order apps or special drinks, we just talked with an empty table. Perhaps the experience would have been different if we ordered wine or something. Price is probably closer to $$$ than $$$$."}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and provided exceptional service. Food was decent and price of menu items were reasonable considering the portion sizes.  Party: 3 people Items ordered:  Appetizer - Tuna Escabeche Mains - Tiger Shrimp & Crab Linguine + $10 for 1/2 dozen Raspberry Point oysters from PEI, Dourada $10 for 1/2 dozen Raspberry Point oysters from PEI & Arroz A Valenciana  Desserts - 3 Maple Crème Brûlée  Wasn't a big fan of the Tuna Escabeche due to the texture of the watermelon which didn't really go well with the tuna. The watermelon juices also diluted the other flavours. My main was the Tiger Shrimp & Crab Linguine along with the 1/2 dozen oysters. The oysters were very fresh and served at the perfect temperature while the linguine was a bit watery for my liking. The presentation could have been a bit better if more emphasis was placed on plating the shrimp. The shrimp was served in diced pieces scattered throughout the pasta with a little too much chilli pepper topped with a bunch of micro arugula. Lastly, the crème brûlée was really smooth and creamy served with a side of macerated berries that balanced out the sweetness from the caramelized sugar. Overall, a decent dining experience for a first visit."}
{"text":"Was here with a bunch of friends six of us in total nice atmosphere waitresses were fantastic!!! I think her name was Ashley very very good on her game. I would go back, I think the chef should deboned fish it was a bit of a struggle I didn't enjoy that. Overall great night and I would return"}
{"text":"Love this place, it has a very South Beach feel. The servers are wonderful and very knowledgeable. They take the time to remember names and are always very attentive. The food is delicious. It is made with love. I am personally not a huge fan of their wine menu but I believe that is because i simply do not know a lot about Portuguese wines."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this restaurant! I'm a discriminating foodie who's worked for years in the hospitality industry. The food was excellent! The presentation and creativity of the dishes was amazing and everything was so fresh and delicious.  Our server was an old school professional server who anticipated all of our needs even before we asked. She was friendly and attentive without being too obtrusive.  I would definitely recommend a visit and be sure to try the fish, whatever it may be."}
{"text":"Most lovely occasion restaurant. I think I like the Stouffvile location more, but still has the same great wine choices, food and service! They also have a location by the water in the summer."}
{"text":"The best in Aurora, no question! We enjoyed the food, the service, the drinks! We will go back again & again & again!"}
{"text":"No, no. 8:30 pm reservations. Walked-in at 8:15 pm and never acknowledged till 8:45 pm. No tables ready - no offer to sit at the bar. Never going back. It's Aurora, ON not New York honey."}
{"text":"We love it here! One of the only date night restaurants we go to in Aurora. The food is terrific, nice upscale but cosy atmosphere and fantastic service every time. They switch up the menu every now and then so it's best to check out their website to see what they have on the go, but my experience has been excellent every time!!"}
{"text":"What at gem, Fantastic food wonderful atmosphere brussels sprouts were amazing. Very busy place make sure you call ahead and make a reservation but well worth the wait fantastic all around"}
{"text":"Fish bone is a four star for aurora standards.  The drinks are ok.  We had the mussels, the meat is 1/2 of the shell.  the pizza crust is so hard from wood oven, no where close to true Italian pizzas, most likely frozen dough.  A sausage with flames looks good but taste like regular sausage.  the Spanish rice dish is supposed to taste Spanish, but tastes like curry."}
{"text":"The wine was wonderful that we had with dinner. I'm not a big wine drinker but this was lovely. The food was good. We tried a few different appetizers and enjoyed them.   The brussel sprouts and beer salad were great. I had the halibut which was very good and my husband had the scallops on risotto were very tasty.   So many interesting choices on the menu. We would go back again but for a special occasion it is a bit pricey for Aurora."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night for Valentines Day dinner.  I really like what they did with the place inside and the food was exceptional. We had the fish tacos for an app and they were great. My wife had the scallops for her main and I had the salmon. They were both very good. My only complaint would be that it took a bit long to get our food but that just allowed me to have some more drinks. I still give this restaurant 5 stars."}
{"text":"I think it's so underrated how difficult it is to perfectly cook fish & seafood. For a group 10 I thought fishbone absolutely nailed it. I had the whole grilled fish and I think it was the dish of the night. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great ambiance. Intimate but not overly fussy.  We ordered the Brussel sprouts and shrimp taco for appetizers and they were both fantastic!  So much flavour! The main dishes were good but didn't compare to the appetizers. The grilled whole fish (sea bass) was a little dry and we found quite a few bones even though it was deboned at table side. The Arroz a Valenciana was ok. The shrimp in the dish was delicious but the chorizo was so salty, it over powered the rest of the dish. The service was excellent! Our waitress was so friendly and attentive. The wine house wine is like a Pinot Grigio and paired well with dinner. Overall a great dinner."}
{"text":"Good, quality, fine dining in Aurora. Very nice restaurant.   Service was friendly and professional.   Seafood was good quality, food came out in a timely manner, lots of good food being brought out. I should of bought an appetizer as I could of still eaten more after my main course. Normally, an entree should be enough food for me so this was my only disappointment.  I had the salmon on risotto and my date had the seafood linguine.  I  would definitely come back to this restaurant though, it's a great place for a date. I like the décor, I like that it's close.  Nothing on the menu really made my eyes go wide....is just a good, decent restaurant with good, decent service."}
