{"text":"Delicious burger and fries. Service are great and workers are friendly. Burgers combo, Hot dogs combo and their poutine are the best!"}
{"text":"This place is fairly decent. Burgers are delicious. What attracted me was the price for their 4 oz burger which is only $3.49 so I thought I'd give it a try.

I order the Texas burger (4 oz) for $3.49. If you want to add cheese, it's an extra dollar. The patty is thin, looks so much like The Real McCoy patty. Overall I think this place is comparable to The Real McCoy in Scarborough.

My BF got the 7oz homemade burger. Again, taste is pretty solid. He got a combo with fries and a small pop. Fries are just ok.

So the bill came up to $12.45, pretty cheap huh?

You get what you pay for. I would probably come back in the area if I am craving for a cheap burger."}
{"text":"Decent burger joint.  Wasn't a fan of the fries, but the burgers was good the place was clean and the staff super friendly."}
