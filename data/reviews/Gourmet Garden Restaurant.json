{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago for lunch. Then ate here same day for dinner! My wife is Chinese Malaysian and found the food authentic and well made. The price is very good and you don't get too small nor too large a portion.  We had the beef rendang, laksa, and char kuay teow. All of which were good especially considering the price. We also had cendol to drink which you can skip out on - it doesn't have enough palm sugar.    We are definitely going back again and would recommend it to anyone looking for good Malaysian and Singaporean cuisine. Just remember it isn't a proper sit down restaurant with full service. These are like hawker stands, but we prefer that anyway!"}
{"text":"You certainly do not go here for the decor (as it is a small enclosed food court) but if you have a friend who is from Malaysia or Singapore go for it with him or her. My Malaysian friend raves about the food in his judgement the best Malaysian food he has had in Toronto. I found the food (which he chose) was fresh with a nice blend of different spices/vegetables."}
{"text":"For a food court it deserves 5 stars  Tough to get a table at dinnertime. Gourmet Garden is a Singapore Malaysian. What it lacks in ambiance it makes up for in great food.  Simple authentic meals.  Try the Mee Goring (spicy noodle dish) or spicy chicken and mushroom on rice. Very inexpensive and consistent. I can often get a good meal there for under 6 bucks."}
{"text":"I just have to applaud any place that has the kahunas to offer a Singaporean/Malaysian menu as big as what GG is attempting to offer. Seems to me they're trying to serve dishes from an entire hawker center rather than just the all time favorites. It's like they took a whole recipe book on SG cuisine and put the index as the menu and for that I'm a fan.  The next question is of course, how was the food. Well let's get real, when you are the jack of all trades, master of none, the food can't be that great or authentic so I expected such and was not disappointed. It's decent enough for me to visit again but it's not a place I'd be dying to go to have a great SG dining experience.  Ordered: Seafood Horfun Hokien Mee Chicken Rice Teh Tarik/Coffee (they dont use real Malaysian coffee nor tea)  Food:3 stars Kahunas:5 stars Rating:4 stars"}
{"text":"I'm surprised no one has written a review of this place.  Gourmet Garden is a hidden jewel.  The Malaysian & Singaporean dishes are authentic and tastes good! Portions are good, but tends to be more if you decide to take-out (which I do all the time). Orders are made to order and are quick.  Lots and lots of variety and choices!  I have yet to try everything.  Costs are fair, as it's in a food court.    The only thing negative I can say about this place is the location.  It's located in a small food court.  Most of the people are seen doing take-outs, as it is limited seating.  By far, Gourmet Garden and Restoran Malaysia are my go to places for Malaysian food when I'm too lazy to make it myself.  Highly recommended.    Note: Penang Prawn Mee are only served on weekends. IMO This dish is better than Restoran Malaysia's version."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for the price and menu selection. Not to mention the authenticity of the food. I love the Laksa and Singapore Chicken dish."}
{"text":"A total dive-y place, even by food court standard.  Hard-to-find no visibility from Sheppard, you will smell the kitchen when you dine there and smell like a kitchen afterwards.   But, it has some of the best Singapore/Malaysian food I've found in GTA.  Despite a China Town location and mostly Chinese clients, they don't waterdown the spice level or flavour intensity.   Huge menu, they try to cram hawker food from Singapore, KL, Penang, and even Malacca, all into one place. So some are pretty good: -- Laksa Singapore style -- Asam Laksa, similar to Penang style -- Ikan Bakar aka stingray grilled in Banana leaf -- Roti prata -- Oyster omelet -- Balachan eggplant or string beans  Some dishes are only available on weekends like Roti prata, asam laksa, etc.  If you live close by, take-out would be a good option. Once I met a couple who drove all the way from Winston Churchill; they told me whenever they miss food from homeland, they'd drive to this place, which is weekly."}
{"text":"Getting tired of the full SERVICE restaurant scene, I took my family to eat at the Centerview Square Food Court for dinner.  It's been awhile since I took my family for Food Court since my School days probably at Pacific Mall or something.    I'm kind of glad it was Gourmet Garden because it's such a different atmosphere then we're used to in the last few years.  When's the last time you've taken YOUR family for dinner at a Food Court??  Sometimes it's simply all about good food and family no matter where you go to eat.   The sights here are all on the Food and the SOUNDS come from the Wok constantly frying up something.  It almost brings me back to the memories of Asian Street Stalls where those sights and sounds are a big part of the experience.  That aside, it's a Food Court so it doesn't have the cleanest tables, seats, washrooms, etc...  It's not a place to stay either as people coming in to pickup their orders zoom behind your seats towards the counter.  The air circulation isn't great but it depends on perspective as the HEAT is mostly from the Wok and whatever it is cooking.  Penang Prawn Mee(Sat/Sun Only, $5.80) is MOSTLY good with delicious soup stock, 3 Shrimps, Fish Cake Slices, Bean Sprouts, Fried Shallots, Egg, Chili Pepper and a spoonful of Sambal Paste that tastes pretty good too.  The only downside for me is the Egg Noodles which didn't excite me much.  Malaysia Pork Satay($5.80/pk) & Bef Satay($6.50/pk) were tasty especially with the PEANUT Satay Sauce which accompanies.  Hokkien Mee($5.50) which is Egg Noodle w/Seafood & Chicken is where the Noodles worked better in this application in my opinion rather than as a Soup Noodle.  Guess what?  We also had Roti Prata w/Curry(3pcs/$4.50) but it's a deep-fried THIN Roti that was very oily but nice and thin but it had a bit of elasticity chew which you can see when you pull it apart.  It came with a small bowl of Curry that had a piece of small Chicken and if lucky a brunoise of Potato.  This was a good snack though as I found myself DUNKING the Roti nonstop into the Curry.  Maybe open up a restaurant called \"Dunkin' Roti\"."}
{"text":"A total hole-in-the-wall hidden away in a little food court in Scarborough.  However, it serves oneo fhte best Malaysian foods I've ever had.  My friends had the laksa while I had the nasi lemak.  The only complaint that I had was the place was freakin' cold because the weather was getting colder and they lack any heating system there.  So.. I would suggest take-out during the cold season!"}
{"text":"When I was waiting in line to pick up over the phone order of Extra Spicy Mee Goreng, I saw something that got me real excited...  Desserts and Pastry!! Kuid Dadar, Ondeh Ondeh etc... most of them are for $1 or 3... perfect snacks to enjoy after my noodle!  They are all made fresh daily...with great coconut flavour and not overly sweet.... and with the small bite size, I didn't feel I just pigged out!"}
