{"text":"I was with my two young granddaughters, ages 7 and. 9 this past Friday evening for dinner at Mapleside.  The service staff was horrible!  Our meal from beginning to end took about two hours!!!  I even had to ask three times for my check!  I had the feeling from the servers comments that they already were told they were working outside, inside, at the bar, and they weren't taking care of our table too?  I will not be returning anytime soon!  Paying the check was a tough thing to even accomplish!  I had to find the server to even pay my check!"}
{"text":"Visited The Orchard House for the third time since changing ownership this past weekend and again was very happy with our experience. The Chorizo, Pork and Bacon Meatball appetizer was delicious. My daughter enjoyed her tortellini (the daily special), and I am a fan of the pulled pork sandwiches (the pork pulls in the flavors of the neighboring apple orchard...yum). It's an out of the way location, but the gorgeous view is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the experience at the Orchard House at all.  It was mediocre at best. The staff seemed friendly enough and were trying to be pleasant, but I think they even sensed the awkwardness of this cavernous space that had only a handful of patrons.  Perhaps it was just a slow Monday evening.  

Decor
Nice bar, but no life.  Main restaurant area was very large without tables (seems an odd use of space) . . . seating is around the perimeter.  Relatively clean, but carpet looked worn.  Had a problem with flies.

The Food
I ordered a chopped salad that was significantly smaller than what I anticipated for the price.  Sadly, it was also flavorless, and wet. My father had the all-you-can-eat ribs.  This is the special that drew us to the Orchard House.  He never asked for more than the initial rack that came out; a clear indication the ribs didn't satisfy.  I tried a bone.  The flavor was ok, but they were somewhat dry.  

The Service
When my father asked for more barbeque sauce, the waiter forgot to bring it; and had to be asked a second time, after which there was little need for it when it finally arrived.  Our waiter would often disappear for periods of time without checking in; quite often checking on a neighboring table and bypassing us.  This was somewhat disconcerting, because although he had about 2 other tables aside from ours, as previously mentioned, the restaurant was relatively empty.  When my father was asked if he would like anything more, he asked for baked beans, his request was heard, but ignored. We accepted the check gladly.

Overview
Very disappointed."}
{"text":"After being seated, the waitress took our drink orders. After 15 minutes they arrived. We ordered shortly after and the meal was served fairly quickly. Unfortunately, we didn't  have any silverware.
My wife's food was cold, I had to get extra tarter sauce for myself. I had one beer and she never asked if I wanted another. One person never received the water he requested. Overall the dining experience was unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Gave the restaurant another try as they have new owners, did not make a difference. Buffet was awful prime tough as leather and paper thin. The best part of the meals was the roll and you got only 1 per person and asked to share the tiny container of butter. At 6:30pm server should not be cleaning the carpet in front of our table . Another horrible experience and will not return nor recommend !!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's an improvement from the original Mapleside restaurant, but anything is an improvement on what used to be here. 

I attended my cousin's bridal shower here and was hopeful for the new menu. The pulled pork was great, but cold. The chicken salad was okay. There was only one server assigned for our party. She was fabulous, but obviously some help would have been great for her. Replenishment was slow because no one was there to help our poor server.

The bar service was also incredibly slow. The bathrooms were a mess and only had two stalls.

Another downside was the fact that there was plenty of parking in the main lot, but due to the festivals we had to park in the field across the street. Ever lug a giant wedding shower gift through a field and across a busy street? Not a great time. Had the business accommodated the shower that had been booked here months ago, I would have given more stars. 

It has potential, but I'm not sure if I'll be back. I live relatively close to this restaurant; however, Mapleside is always having festivals. I'm stuck in their traffic for nearly 20 minutes every weekend when I need to get somewhere that's on Pearl Road. I wish they'd expand their parking situations before playing host to festivals every weekend."}
{"text":"Nice little place .. Might look for something else if I was in the area. Wasn't that bad but wasn't great. French onion soup was good but salty (however I eat VERY little salt so it could just be my taste). I tried a bite of the grilled cheese sandwich and it was great! (Though not as good as mine, wink wink) I would probably do away with the tomato and stick with just the bacon. The buffet is pretty good especially given the price. They offer much of what's on the menu (which is not that extensive) .. Including pulled pork (really good), cod (very fishy), chicken, beef, Mac n Cheese, green beans, red skin potatoes, fries .. Might be missing a few things.

This was Saturday lunch time .. Might vary throughout the week and time."}
{"text":"One word... Horrible! We came here for Saturday dinner and highly disappointed. The main reason we even came was for the the menu that was on Yelp..everything sounded delicious. Come to find out this place was taken over by someone else over a year ago!  We get in and noticed that their were hardly any cars. The restaurant itself was dark. The hostess wanted to seat us at a side table when their were booths available along the windows with a view (of a parking lot). Server came and handed us these menu's that included aps, salads, sandwiches, and 4 dinner options. Granted, they had a $15 all you can eat buffet with fried chicken, prime rib, and fish- along with sides and salad. One ordered the buffet for the prime rib and was loaded with fat and no sauces to go along with. Another ordered the pulled pork sandwich and was so dry you couldn't even eat it.. told the server and he was like sorry - didn't even ask if wanted something else. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and only ate the mashed potatoes. The bottom of the plate was covered in butter so much that fried part of the chicken just fell off. The manager came over and said she would take the pulled pork off and never did... needless to say, we were highly disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Buffet and pasta station were absolutely horrible. The Caesar salad that came with it was good, hence the 1 star, but sadly that was the highlight of the evening. I would have been happier getting a hot dog  and Polar Pop down the street from Circle K."}
{"text":"A step up from the Melrose Grille days. Last time I was here, it was the first week of the transition from the old Melrose to Driftwood's \"Orchard House\".

1) Service has become incredibly better. Melrose set the bar pretty low, but Orchard House is professional. Big improvement. 

2) The space itself is awkward. Huge with few tables, it feels a bit like eating in an empty warehouse. This place needs a re-design to feel cozy. 

3) The bar area is out front. No real life. I can't imagine a reason to choose this bar over any other. They might be better served flipping restaurant area over to the bar side and using the restaurant area as a bar/club that takes advantage of the view and space. 

4) The food is much improved. Had the chicken fried steak and my friend had the fish fry. Both were very good. This is some of the best prepared food in the area. 

5) The menu is strange. Is this comfort food? A barbecue joint?  Figure it out, because you are confusing me. How about a seasonal farm to table menu?  Because barbecue isn't going to pack them in.  Or haven't you noticed?

6) The combined lack of ambience (while managing to waste the best view in NEO), and a menu without a clear continuity is going to kill this place. Signs of desperation are beginning to show. Specials being extended, the seasonal beer is STILL Christmas Ale (what bar with patrons still has this in near February), etc. Sad, because the food preparation and service issues have mostly been fixed. 

With some tweaks and a sense of purpose, this could be a gem. But that would require more investment - so I won't hold my breath."}
