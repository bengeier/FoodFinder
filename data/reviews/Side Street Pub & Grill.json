{"text":"I ordered delivery through Just Eat and they messed my order up big time (no fault to Side Street), but Side Street went out of their way to send me a new order right away! Their food is excellent, I order just for the beer battered fries. After this experience, I will be sure to continue ordering in future, just not through Just Eat."}
{"text":"Hit this place with a girlfriend on a Saturday while we were on a bike ride through Kensington. Service was great - our waitress was friendly and polite and the venue itself was open & clean.  Food was AMAZING and reasonably priced.  Only thing we didn't like was how once 8:30/9pm hit, the music shifted from top 40's to heavy rap music and the volume was cranked. The crowd started getting more rowdy & seedy as the music shifted & the time got later so we didn't feel comfortable staying and left much earlier then we had planned.  We'll definitely be going back because of the amazing food, but will avoid it in the evenings."}
{"text":"I have to say the new owner has done an excellent job of transforming this pub into what is. The staff are great, the food is great and everyone working there is on the ball.  The owner is a big stocky guy and he catches every detail and makes sure everything is perfect. Side Street is fast becoming the new hot spot in kensington for sure. I also hear he owns the Reagle Beagle as well. I've only been there once but the chicken wings were the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing fries! Decent burger! Karaoke is fun and energetic, but my beers are empty and the waitress TOOK MY LAST FRY WITH OUT ASKING"}
{"text":"Best place for some delicious food and reasonable prices plus specials everyday of the week."}
{"text":"Pretty average pub fare, not impressed with the extra $3.99 for sweet potato fries. Had the beef dip, was pretty good but it needed more onions & mushrooms. Staff was ok, not impressive. The bathrooms are quite nice. I wasn't disappointed with anything in particular, I just wasn't wowed with anything. Good for grabbing lunch and a pint."}
{"text":"Side street is very kind! I ordered on skip the dishes and my meal got mixed up with someone elses. They instantly called me and offered to personally deliver my original order and let me keep the other order as well! Thank you for your great service! Will order again.   Also the deep fried cheesecake is AMAZING."}
{"text":"This pub is the new star in the neighborhood! Mike and his wife Samantha took over this place about two years ago and completely revived it! The pizza and the salt and pepper ribs are my favorites! Live DJ on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery but so far I really like this place. Fries are excellent, beer battered and crunchy. I had the BLT with cheese and it was pretty tasty for a pub. I can't comment on the environment due to ordering delivery only. Hopefully, I'll get to go in and eat soon!"}
{"text":"Came to this place with my newly 18 year old daughter, was the third place we came and finally settled due to waitress and amazing atmosphere !!! Know she will definitely be back...... thank you Ashley!!!"}
{"text":"Went there before one love concert. Was really good. Fast service, super friendly. It was Saturday so flavored vodka was on special had three: grape, watermelon and vanilla all with ginger ale. Made very well. Ordered BLT with fries (make sure you get the fries) eff best fries I've had in a longgg time. I already miss them. BLT was delicious on ryeno cheese for me.  Bf had buffalo chicken sandwich it was huge and he loved it. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now for late lunch and both times were good experiences. The staff are super friendly and efficient, and always stop by to ask if you're ok or need anything. On our most recent visit, my wife and I had a plan to share some nacho appetizers and then share an entree. Bad mistake: the nachos are GINORMOUS and could easily feed a peewee hockey team. We ate the nachos and that filled us up for lunch and dinner!  So, don't order the nachos unless you're with a group of at least four people or that's all you're eating for the day. The other stuff on the menu is good, filling and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This isn't my first trip here, but is my first review. First off, best fries I've ever had. Period. Bar none. To top it off, the gravy is very obviously home made, not just mass produced junk.  The staff is fantastic, and was every time I've been here. While their choices of beer on tap isn't the best in town, there's more than enough variety for the majority of beer drinkers.  Did I mention the fries? Just wow.  The patio is great, not massive but a decent size, and in a great spot in Kensington for people watching/interacting.   They have great specials, both food wise and drinks wise.  To top it off, the man in charge is always wandering through, talking to both regulars and newcomers alike. And treating them all like they're regulars. It's really the perfect local. I wish it was closer to home!"}
