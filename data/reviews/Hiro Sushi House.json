{"text":"Went there for a Saturday Lunch, service was really slow as the restaurant was packed and they only had 2 waitress. People couldn't place orders or pay their bills, naturally food service is delayed too. There was 6 tables that waited 10 mintues to pay, finally the guy beside me couldnt take it anymore and walks to the cashier to pay; soon as this happens 6 other people do the same, and there was effectively no food delivery or other service until they were done 10 minutes later.   Finally after 25minutes of wait(reminder this is for lunch) with no tea or soup, I was able to place my order. somehow my waitress did not serve me tea-It's something that comes with every Sushi restaurant so I didnt ask, after my sashimi got here with no tea, I couldn't find my waitress again to ask her for it. I gotta say its a different experience to have sashimi without tea, didnt really like it.  Food portion was average to small, not really worth the price(13.99 or 12.99). my 12 piece sashimi had 9 piece salmon in it, I got tired of salmon by the end and left two piece in the plate. As I was about to pay, a old lady(looks like shes the manager or owner) realized I did not have tea, served it to me and apologized for having too much salmon in my dish. She was sincere, the restaurant was busy, but never the less forgetting tea and have 9/12 salmon sashimi is not something I will go back for. She did not offer me any compensation for my next visit, so I would likely not go back."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here.  The service was quick, although I have had much better sushi elsewhere, I'm not sure if i would come and eat here again if I was in this neighborhood.   I ordered the Hiro combo with the North York Roll.  The only real negative experience was with the Unagi, it tasted very fishy and was difficult to swallow.  Good thing for wasabi!  The server could of checked in on me to see if everything was good or if I needed anymore tea, however it was relatively busy for a single server.  Nonetheless, $39 with tip was ok."}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and both times were pretty good. I enjoyed the quaint restaurant with lunch specials that are priced pretty decent.  My sister got the Beef Teriyaki Bento which included miso soup, salad, rice and sweet/sour chicken. I got the Bulgogi Bento which included miso soup, salad, rice, salmon rolls and sushi. For the price we paid, I would give this restaurant a 3.5 stars if possible.   Service was fairly good but when we were almost finish eating, all the employees were also eating their lunch and it took some time to get the bill. But overall, food was pretty good not amazing and service was average. Although I do admit they were quite friendly.   I would try this place again but I do not recommend the noodles here, I do not feel it is their speciality."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today. I had the sashimi lunch special which is $9.95 and which came with soup, salad, 12 pcs of sashimi and 8 small rolls. I requested that the sashimi and the rolls all be salmon. Everything was really good. The salmon was really fresh. For that much sashimi and salmon rolls you can't beat the price. This will be my new lunch place when I am craving Japanese food!"}
{"text":"I dined alone at this restaurant because it is close to my hotel.  Admittedly, this isn't the best sushi place, but the quality-to-price ratio exceeded all expectations.  The albacore didn't have any hint of fishiness, and the portion was generous.  With my voracious appetite, the nabe udon + salmon crunchy roll combo plus the albacore nigiri was enough to satiate my dinner hunger."}
{"text":"Hiro Sushi House is another newly opened Japanese sushi joint along Yonge Street. Sometimes I wondering if everyone love eating sushi as much as me, that new sushi places keeps opening up in this neighbourhood.   Lunch Specials always the magic word for me.. just hearing that would have attract me to at least give most of the restaurants a try. Hiro Sushi House for sure has great lunch specials menu starting from $6.95 and serves till 4:00 PM!!   Tempura Combo ($10.95)  - Miso Soup/Salad and Shrimp Tempura, 5 pcs Sushi and 6 pcs Chef's Choice Roll  - My Shrimp and Veggie Tempura arrived in a bento box with salad, rice, gyoza and some fried items on the side. I was thinking that is quite big..and where are my sushi! I want my sushi!!  - My waitress put my order in wrong... instead of Tempura Combo, she put in Shrimp Tempura ($8.95)  - The owner was really nice. I ended up getting my Sushi and rolls plus the Shrimp Tempura bento box too... So much food.. I was so full...  - I love the Tempura, crispy with a really light batter.. not too oily and were all deep fried to light golden brown.  - Sushi was so so... especially the rolls were not too good. AYCE quality... Shari rice was really mashed up... and just lack the fluffiness   The wait staffs here are really nice and young Korean girls.. attentive and soft spoken. The owner was around greeting all the tables and making sure every customers were happy!   Visa and Mastercard only!"}
