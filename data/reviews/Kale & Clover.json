{"text":"There are lots of vegetarian items on the menu and  outdoor seating is always nice. I have only been once but I would go again."}
{"text":"I REALLY LIKE THIS PLACE.... It's just good. Great, healthy, fresh food with lots of GF choices.  The prices are very reasonable, the seating comfortable, the staff quick and friendly and a great, shaded patio. I just had a glass of wine there for the first and it was pretty darn good.... Give this place a try"}
{"text":"Get the cauliflower wings!! Lots of great vegan options here, casual/nice atmosphere, great outdoor area."}
{"text":"Vegan spot and menu clear on what is vegan GF and Veg....  I got Faux Pho.... Nice broth, noodles cooked right.... Jalape√±os... Would add cilantro and real Thai basil and vegan siracha and you will have a winner... Staff need a little training in how to take orders and offer suggestions or help I.e. counter staff. But the Service was good, ambiance cafe like with clean vibe.... Definitely my to go to  Vegan spot in Scottsdale.... Before I open my Vegan Chain here.... :0"}
{"text":"Delicious! Just what we need in North Scottsdale. Can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my aunt, and my mother frequents here occasionally as well.   The cons definitely out way the pros here.   Cons:  #1: Customer service:  Extremely sub-par. Negative stars for the blonde behind the counter. She made no attempt at a greeting and there was absolutely no positive vibe whatsoever or even a hint of a smile....ever. I get that we aren't all excited about work every day, and some people have b*tchy resting face. But, this went beyond this. No one can be as oddly perky as the every jamba juice employee; this was just callous disregard for us as even beings. There wasn't a line or anything, so i don't understand her attitude towards us.  #2: Lack of Freshness, Consistency, & Customization:  a. The juices on the shelf and what they chose to make that day are all you have to choose from. There's a menu with the juice options listed, but they will refuse (asked and answered) to make anything fresh for you, even if the item is  unavailable pre-made.  b. Not only will the available juices shift day to day, but you can see that as the juices settle, each bottle contains a different amount of each ingredient. Some bottles were about half full of the green bulk ingredient, whereas others had less than an inch of it. c. Unlike another nearby place that offers juices as well, you can't customize a juice. We asked this as well  and were given an eye-roll, shrug, and a  no from the ever so lovely cashier. This wouldn't be so much of a con if it wasn't for such a positive experience elsewhere.   #3: Price It cost $8 for 16 oz of pre-bottled juice. If it weren't for the cons listed above, I wouldn't  really hesitate all that much. But, when you can't have your favorite flavor, there's no quality control, there's no way to customize, and you get to deal with someone that rude, it's not worth it.  On that same note, the same, aforementioned place that has multiple locations and is nearby offers pre-bottled for less or you can even order fresh. Everything is also customizable. And, the cashiers at nekter (the other place)will walk you through what you might like or not like at each, customize, and make it fresh.     Pros:  #1: Healthy? (Depends what you consider healthy, the menu item you choose, and all that jazz)   TL;DR: Overpriced food items, self-obsessed staff, and lack of quality control."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. A bit overpriced though. Probably won't return unless we're meeting someone."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful ambiance and architecture, and good service. Gets a bit busy at lunch time, but there is plenty of seating. The Superfood smoothie is delicious and all of their salads are wonderful too!"}
{"text":"First time visit today! It was amazing! I love a healthy alternative! I had the grilled zucchini panini with a side salad! The dressing was amazing and the portions were good! I can't wait till my next visit to try another menu option."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!!! Best food ever and it's extremely healthy!!! Get your butt over to Kale for great service and superb food!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten in the restaurant a couple times and was happy with my salad. Then I got it to go recently, and I felt like I got ripped off. The salad seemed smaller, much less greens in their to go box. I was still hungry after my meal and won't be ordering to go again :("}
{"text":"It was quite enjoyable I came here with my girlfriends and we sat around gossiping but besides that point the atmosphere was awesome the people are so nice and kind the juices out of this world 10 out of 10 would totally recommend"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for a late lunch. The place is very clean and comfortable. We had two of the \"bowls\", mine being the \"Spicy Tofu Thai curry\". A large bowl of ingredients that was the furthest thing from anything Thai I have ever eaten, including absolutely no taste or even spicy  in the least bit. I tried drowning it in some hot sauce they had on hand just to be able to taste something, but even that couldn't save it. Thinking it was just a fluke or a bad day there, I asked my friend how his dish tasted. Same thing. No taste period. Like eating a big bowl of lettuce with nothing on it. Maybe it was an off day for them. I have no idea. Won't be back. And, no, Sam Fox is NOT worried. Go to any of his restaurants and eat the food. He didn't make it to where he is on bland, tasteless food. Healthy food and organic ingredients are great. All I'm saying is make it taste good."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this healthy and convenient dining concept. Everything we've tried here has been amazing both in flavor profile and in nutritional content. I always feel amazing after dining here! My current favorite menu item is the Southwest Quinoa Bowl, though the Salmon with Quinoa and the Black Bean Tacos are also delicious. My husband recently discovered the Seoul Food bowl as well, which has got to be the most delicious stir-fry concoction I've ever tasted! He's hooked on it and we actually had to go back 2 days in a row this past weeked so we could both get a fix of our favorite bowls :) Thank you Kale and Clover for keeping it fresh, delicious, and innovative!"}
{"text":"Mindful but NOT organic.  Food tastes great but was very disappointed to learn mindful does not mean organic.  Super expensive."}
{"text":"Lots of healthy veg options. So good to have this up in north Scottsdale! I will be back!"}
{"text":"So I walk in on Wednesday for breakfast to get something healthy after workingout at 930 in the morning. They have a great breakfast menu BUT THEY DONT SERVE BREAKFAST N THE WEEKDAYS!!  Why are you even open??  Just to serve shakes and coffee???  What a waste of a restaurant to be open at 8am but not serving breakfast.  I walked out across the street to First Watch.  I noticed another customer also leaving Kale & Clover for the same reason. Must be nice for store to pay employees wages, electricity,  rent, etc. and not serve any breakfast during the week, but be open 8am."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a wonderful lunch today at this new restaurant.   What a transformation of this location.   Kale & Clover is definitely a place I will be returning to often.   The restaurant has a great vibe, friendly staff, fantastic food and is light and spacious.  They even have a wonderful outdoor patio.   The manager Brandon Hassle not only was greeting customers, he was helping with every aspect including taking food to patrons.  This great new restaurant is creating a wonderful dining experience for their customers.   The menu is loaded with different options and reminds me of some of the SF Bay Area local restaurants I loved so much.    There have been other restaurants in this location and all failed.   Kale and Clover is here to stay!  They have redesigned the interior and exterior of this location and have a menu loaded with different options and the quality of the food is top notch!   Can't wait to return for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Healthy, great tasting meals made from real, whole ingredients. Lovely atmosphere and top-notch service. Our favorite place for date night!"}
{"text":"I was backpacking across this beautiful continent in search of the best vegan food. I am not vegan but somehow I realized that was my calling. I stumbled upon Kale & Clover in Grayhawk and to say I was flabbergasted would be an understatement! I tried the Penne Pasta with Turkey Sausage and found it to be very aesthetically pleasing. I added extra turkey sausage in hopes that the protein and amino acids would someday restore my lost toe phalange. Although I did not gain a limb at Kale & Clover, my HEART gained an outstretched phalange reaching for more vegan-friendly goodies at this new joint."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. The salads grill cheese hamburger and pasta was very delicious.  Will come back here definitely"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here, the food and service were amazing, but the last couple of months it has gone a little downhill. I don't know if they have changed the staff, but when you are sitting waiting for your food, the staff keeps gossiping, laughing and being loud and you can hear everything. The last time we went in there were 4 of them at the counter and only one was working, the others were chatting while doing nothing. They should also work on the timing, the food takes so much longer now."}
{"text":"My first time here. Wanted a healthy lunch. I am a vegan. They have vegetarian, vegan, GF, as well as, meat selections. I had quinoa & black bean tacos. It came with 3 tacos on corn tortillas. The chef let me know the corn tortillas have lard in them & suggested he wrap the taco in lettuce. I still chose the corn tortillas. A side of grated carrots with garbanzo beans was included. Nicely & lightly flavored. All seemed healthy and good. I will definitely come back & try the cauliflower steak next!  Nice location. Outdoor seating. Lots of windows. Dining area has high warehousey ceiling. Music is medium loud. Great lunch spot. They also serve breakfast."}
{"text":"The interior of this place is stunning!  They have a great choice of delicious menu items.  I ordered the farmers market salad and it was delicious.  It not only tasted great, but it looked awesome.  The strawberry green tea I ordered was also great.  I'll definitely be back.  It's also not that pricy!"}
{"text":"Great Banana nut smoothie and service. I'm visiting from Chicago and this is the 2nd night I've had the smoothie. Really good. Both nights the service was good, friendly and genuine. Tonight an employee asked me about my day and before I left she gave me a free salad to take home for breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place opened because I've been looking for other healthy, fresh food places I could eat at. I've tried a couple things on the menu, superfood salad, curry, smoothies, etc. and they'll all be amazing. I love the atmosphere and their patio seating is great. The only downside is that it can be pretty expensive.. Still, I understand because it really is yummy, fresh food."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place! The food is so yummy, light portion which helps me not to overindulge, ingredients are fresh and the place is so clean. It feels great to nourish my body with such healthy food. I wish I can eat here 3 times a day, seven days a week!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. we absolutely love Local Bistro and eat there all the time...decided to check out Kale and Clover. Can't believe we didn't start eating here earlier. Food was fresh, healthy and all the employees very polite/friendly. Great job Osio."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to Grabba Green and when I realized this wasn't it, I was excited to try a similar place. Although my lunch was good (vegetarian red curry)--great flavor and portion size for the price, I was really disappointed and surprised that Kale & Clover uses plastic to-go containers. I really don't expect a place that has healthier choices to serve it with a side of chemicals and other plastic by-products that are broken down and leach into food when the food is hot. It makes me wonder what other less than healthy choices Kale & Clover is making. A kraft/compostable container may cost more, but you won't lose customers over it. Next time I am going to Grabba Green."}
{"text":"Wow! Curry was on point! I got it with chicken and I can't wait to go back to get more! Partner got faux pho also delectable. Food was so good that I got the quinoa tacos togo... Also AWESOME! Nothing was over/under cooked, very flavorful, it was quick friendly service ... Atmosphere was so lovely. Restaurant is absolutely beautiful!!!"}
{"text":"We like to eat local and real fresh. Sysco will never give you good stuff. This place is like  a copy wannabe flower child and true food but cheap. The taste is not there and super expensive. We don't like to go to places where they lie. So sorry we don't like Sysco :(. We got sick so many times that we are done with this place."}
{"text":"Me and my sister where so excited to try this place we went around 9am and the guy who \"helped\" us was very rude. I had a very bad experience here. The first thing he said was that they only have smoothies and juices at the time and I said okay. He said that they only serve breakfast on Saturdays which was fine but then he said \"we don't cook during the week\" I was confused by this and as I looked at the menu I didn't understand how they would make some of their dishes so I asked again what do you mean and he said we don't I can make you a salad but I won't put any protein because we don't cook during the week. So I said well then how do you make the seared salmon.... He just stared at me and said \"ummm we would make that after 11\" and I told him then you do cook during the week but after 11. He didn't say anything and me and my sister left. He clearly didn't want to serve us I'm not sure the reason behind this. I'm still very confused about what happened but I'm never going back. Why would I? they are a restaurant and  \"they don't cook during the week!\""}
{"text":"Ingredients are simple, yet robust taste if you want to clean eat!"}
{"text":"Lot of gluten free vegetarian, vegan and smoothies. Everything is fresh and can be made to your specifications including food allergies. Outside seating available. Helpful staff. Noise level a little high at times. Popular place. Best salmon my husband has ever had."}
{"text":"After reading several of the reviews I definitely will not eat at this restaurant. The prices seem to high priced for the portions served and additional cost for added ingredients.  This is Arizona, not New York."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great healthy food, the Faux Pho was incredibly good, hot and spicy with quality ingredients, thanks for the vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite neighborhood eatery. Everything on the menu is very much clean eating, but it doesn't compromise in taste. The salmon is my personal favorite.  The ambiance is modern and inviting. Very much a hidden gem in the valley."}
{"text":"Was looking for a healthy choice for lunch and found it!  The place was inviting, clean and the service was great.  Many choices on the menu for whatever you have a taste for.  Both my wife and I had the vegetable salad with grilled chicken.  Salad was fresh and the grilled chicken was still hot when our salads came to the table.  A little pricier than some places but I am willing to pay more a fresh and healthy meal.  Nice outside patio which will be great once it cools down just a bit.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good healthy food. A little pricey, but it is health food. Love the chicken & hummus, great size and filling. Everyone is nice. Wish there was other locations around the valley."}
{"text":"It's my new found love!! Being vegan, breakfasts can be hard to find in north Scottsdale, but not anymore! If eating clean and with a conscious is you way of eating them you too can find a new love at Kale & clover!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  I was in no rush to try Kale & Clover because...I don't like Kale.  (I know I know...stupid)   But I LOVE the seared salmon and the Caesar salad, the people there are so friendly and helpful when we can't decide on what to try next, the restaurant is always clean & nice.  It's a little pricey, but oh so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting friends and family in AZ. This was by far the worst food I had on my 3 week visit. And keep in mind I ate out everyday. We ordered 3 entrees and they were all inedible. It was so bad that it doesn't even deserve a single star. This place is awful."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying your restaurant about a week ago. It seems like the prices were a bit high, since it's not actually organic, but I understand that the food probably cost more when you're more sensitive to the quality of it. I had your kale and clover salad, which clearly said that the kale will be shredded. I decided to order it because the shredded kale sounded like it might be a little easier to eat, and I'm not even a huge fan of kale typically but it sounded good. Unfortunately it look more like somebody just tore large chunks of kale into slightly smaller pieces. It's a simple fix, so I suggest you either shred the kale, or update your menu. I also tried your turkey sausage and pasta, which said it had a spicy pesto sauce. I enjoyed my meal, but the sauce didn't have very much flavor, and it definitely had no spice.   If you can get it a little spicier, like the menu implies, I think it will be terrific. I look forward to trying you again down the road, after you had a chance to fix these items."}
{"text":"I was very excited for this place.  They do have a few Vegan options I tried. The califlour  wing were ok and the portion was half of other restaurants.  I got the tacos as well and they weren't as good as I was expecting. Very plain tasting and skimpy sides.  I'll give them one more shot..."}
{"text":"They have really good Acai Bowls. Everything is fresh and really tasty. Everyone who is looking for a healthy breakfast, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"What a find in north scottsdale!!!!! Delicious food,   Clean , and nice environment.   Even live music (Friday evening ) had the salmon and chia seed pudding. But can't wait to return to try more"}
{"text":"Love this place.  So glad they made it bright and open and airy.  The food is good.  It doesn't say anything about being organic or locally sourced.  The prices should be about 30% lower but considering the location, it is what it is.  I'm in there once or twice a week and haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"I wanted to really, really like this place because restaurants serving healthful food are so few and far between. Nice looking place, very very clean with a great patio area.  I had the chicken & hummus dish. The chicken was delicious and the charred lemon gave it a great flavor; unfortunately the lentils were super salty, so I left those. I enjoyed the quinoa but found the hummus runny and also slightly salty.  Even though the patio is dog-friendly, the dining room where I sat is not, or so I thought. The woman at the table next to ours brought her dog into the restaurant with her (no vest or other indication this was an assistive animal). From what I could tell, none of the servers or manager said anything to her or seated them on the patio.  I know we're all seeing dogs in more places than we have before, but a restaurant?? I would have respected the management more had they escorted her to a patio table (and I have a dog myself, which I leave at home when I'm dining out).  I may try this place again and try something different on their menu, but I sure hope they stand up to people why try to bring an animal into the restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good, healthy options, although pricey. I've had lunch there a few times and taken out- loved it. I don't mind paying a bit more for healthy food that tastes good. On a recent visit at 9:30 am, however, we were stuck having to find a place in the area for approx. 40 min., after the library had not yet opened. We were happy to see the restaurant open, although no customers, giving us pause. When we tried to order breakfast we were told it's only served on the weekend (?)...an open restaurant with a breakfast menu that \"only serves smoothies and coffee\" weekdays?  I purchased a large tea and small drink for my son, $7. Considered a coffee to warm up, but stopped at seeing what appeared to be the owner (? judging by the way the kitchen became quiet at his entrance) in apron walk across the parking lot and back with a Starbucks in hand. At least four other customers pulled up, got out to eye the place and left, perhaps not sure about breakfast either.    Our small party of three was looking for a place to have a little food while a teacher quietly explained a lesson in the corner - a 1 time occurrence and first try at breakfast.This isn't that kind of place. The pulsing music, not heard on prior visits was noticeably turned up so that it was difficult to hear - message received - \"get your food (if it's offered) and get out\" = bad business, esp. while other potentials are driving away without an order during this busy \"snowbird\" season.    Overall, good food, somewhat pricey, pretty place w/uncomfortable seating, menu items not available (breakfast) and unprofessional business sense equates to another unwise business message; the owners don't really need/value the business. To be fair, it isn't a sit down and enjoy yourself place and we knew that but had been stuck that day- ok - but if we'd had the chance to try breakfast and without the music being turned up, we'd have given this restaurant owner our money again."}
{"text":"I've tried kale and clover a few times...... Neither time was that great."}
{"text":"Am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo excited to have this restaurant in our neighborhood.  We had three different salads with three different proteins and all were 5 Star.  My new (healthy) addiction.  Might be back for breakfast or lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"The superfood (kale and quinoa) salad is probably the best kale salad I've ever had. If I lived in Scottsdale I would definitely eat it at least once a week!"}
{"text":"The BEST healthy restaurant in Scottsdale. Even my family, who does not eat healthy, love it! The service is fast, there is something for everyone, and the ambiance is awesome. I would definitely recommend this restaruant for all meals. My favorites are the Carmelized Cauliflower Steak, the Superfood Salad, the Salmon, and Seoul Food. For breakfast, the Sweet Potato Pancakes are amazing!! My only complaint is that they need to build another location in South Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The food is so bomb!! For the prices being a bit expensive ($4 to add tofu) :( it was still well worth it! Plus the decor is simple and just neat looking. I love this place! Nice staff as well."}
{"text":"Chicken and hummus is the best thing I've ever had. We come here multiple times a week and can't get enough!! By far my favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Great new find in North Scottsdale. Wonderful, deliciously fresh food and pressed juices. Gorgeous patio, great ambiance."}
{"text":"Love this place. So many healthy options to choose from. Presentation is always point on.  From there salads to sandwiches   Great patio seating    One of of my favorite lunch places to go to.   They have a great lemonade and tea that is seasonal."}
{"text":"Coming to Kale & Clover is a much better choice than some fast food place.    They have some really healthy yet super tasty options.  I thought the value was good.  The crew in the back are great cooks and the two in the front are beautiful, knowledgeable, healthy and happy.  I felt very welcome dining there."}
{"text":"The food at Kale and Clover is so good!   We have been several times and it is consistent and always great!  I highly recommend this place for great healthy food!!!"}
{"text":"Refreshing and balanced meal. This restaurant is about eating well and caters well to vegan, gluten free and vegetarian - which are none of me but I appreciate the variety. Sister restaurant of sumo maya, local bistro and central bistro.   Nature colors of sand, green and white filled the ambience. Natural looking plates and bowls.   Jambalaya - brown rice, turkey sausage, black beans, bell peppers topped with scallions and piquante sauce. This was a pack of flavor and a pinch of spice for a filling dinner. $12  Karma juice is available in bottles to go. Smoothies are also available. I would come back to try their other plates and bowls and hand helds, along with the other items on their menu for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this restaurant immensely. I've been a number of times and I'm impressed with the concept and the execution. Would be 5 stars but when I spoke to the manager regarding one of the dishes...well her response was less than enthusiastic. It bordered on condescending and lip service to be honest. They have a lot of great dishes. I would avoid only one so far, the soba noodle salad."}
{"text":"Great people, better menu.  Executive Chef from Scottsdale's SumoMaya brought a up tempo and smooth concept along with a uber healthy AND TASTY menu to NORTH Scottsdale. This corridor has yearned for a destination eatery such as this for over a decade.  Could not be happier!!!"}
{"text":"I love the fresh food here. Flavorful and delicious, yet healthy. My favorite is the kale salad with a side of salmon. My kids love the mac and cheese as well as the hummus with vegetables."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this establishment for the first time.  I arrived close to 11:20am.  I ordered the South West Quinoa bowl and added steak.  I also grabbed a fresh squeezed juice, my total was $29.  The bowl was $11, the addition of steak was $7 and my juice was $9.  I was a little taken back by the price, however was willing to pay.  I received my food to go.  When I arrived home and opened my meal the steak was cooked well done, which was not what I expected, I couldn't even chew it was extremely overdone.  However the seasoning and the items in the bowl were amazing.  I guess my lesson was don't order steak and just enjoy the bowl as is.  In the long run it will cost less as well."}
{"text":"I found this place by chance and decided to check it out! After watching the documentary \"forks over knives\" I am trying to be conscious of what I eat...this place nails it!!! They have an excellent variety of \"whole food\" and proteins if you choose to add on!!! Before ordering I asked the cashier which item on the menu contained the largest amount of organic foods. She wasn't sure, but the owner immediately came over to help. It is always a plus when the owner engages his/her customers!!!  See you soon"}
{"text":"I wanted to LOVE this place-the menu looked so delicious but the food was terrible. We took it to go so maybe that's why but it was all smooched together. Yuck. So disappointed. I'm a vegan and was so excited for this. Huge let down."}
{"text":"Oh my!!! Try this place! Especially for Vegans or vegetarians like myself.  Summer rolls are perfect!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato pancakes were to die for. Everything had great flavor. We sat outside and enjoyed the AZ weather"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot. Healthy, quick, beautiful food. Great selection for all lifestyles- vegan, vegetarian, meat eater, paleo- choices for everyone!"}
{"text":"I really do try hard to like this place, this is at least my fourth time here but I think I will give up. The service and location are good. The food is okay I guess I do question how healthy it is, not much in the way of low carb options and $21 for an okay salad and ice tea is really crazy. Oh well plenty of other places in this town."}
{"text":"Holy deliciousness!! Stopped here in my way home from a gig and SO glad I did! I have a hard time finding clean healthy, gluten free food that tastes delicious at restaurants sometimes and this place delivered on taste and presentation. I got a chicken and hummus \"bowl\" which was more like a plate but who cares what it's served on when it tastes that good. Chicken was perfectly cooked and had nice flavor and was served on a bed of humus, lentils and quinoa. There was a little salad of arugula, tomato and avocado on the plate which paired really well with it. My favorite part had to be the charred lemon. I squeezed that bad boy all over the salad and chicken and it was SO good! Like a smokey tart flavor, amazing! Wished I lived closer because I would be back here in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch last week and was impressed. So many great options on the menu. I had the superfood salad with tofu and really enjoyed it. The tofu had great flavor and I loved the beets in the salad. Also enjoyed the kleanse juice which had a great kick to it!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch there. I ordered the kale salad with the addition of chicken and my daughter ordered the chicken sandwich.  The chicken sandwich was really good. The bread was great and the chicken salad was  tasty. My daughters comment when my kale green apple almond salad arrived was \" Bet you are glad you added the chicken\". The chicken was the only good thing about the salad. It was super moist and had a lot of flavor. Otherwise it was just a bowl of kale. I played the game of spot the raisin and almonds with my daughter."}
{"text":"Giving it 5 stars now that the old manager is gone. They have great people working here now and the food is amazing! Cauliflower wings are the best here!"}
{"text":"Not really my cup of tea.   I was told it was like chop house but the only similarity is that they sell food and healthy drinks.   They are really over priced and the food size is small.   I had the Carne as asada which was tasty but $25 for a sandwich and drink is way too much.   It just felt snobby.   Considering where it is located I should have guessed what it would be like."}
{"text":"I'll keep this review short and simple - I came here to eat breakfast today. They don't make breakfast food during the week?! Only the weekends. I have never heard of a place doing this. Left here empty handed. Giving them two stars for the nice set up and inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is one of the better heathy organic places I've been. I really love the bowls, haven't had one I didn't like yet. Prices are actually reasonable for the ingredients and area."}
{"text":"Loving the organic options, seared salmon ( although I forgot to ask the source of the salmon and it isn't promoted). Had a glass of Pinot Noir with lunch. Fabulous and friendly service."}
{"text":"I ordered the Caesar Salad.......well, what their menu calls a caesar salad. It was $7 for a small bowl of romaine lettuce and some grated Parmesan cheese. I added the grilled Chicken for $5 more and received almost half a chicken breast. Thankfully I asked for the dressing on the side because it did not taste anything like caesar dressing.  $12.00 for about $2.00 worth of food. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Visit #2 definitely left something to be desired. The first time here we had the turkey sausage with pesto and it was excessively salty. Great flavor but way too much salt for a \"healthy\" dish. Regardless, it left us feeling excited to get back.  Tonight we had the burger and the chopped salad with chicken.  I can't say that it was bad, because that would be a tad harsh. It just didn't have the flavor I expected. It was bland and nothing to write home about.  Needless to say I will be back, but won't be quite as anxious to get there this time around."}
{"text":"Here is the deal. The food is good. It's fine. It is convenient and it is in a nice part of Scottsdale. However, it is way overpriced. Some of the wait staff is downright rude! RUDE. The person who just served me seemed annoyed that I even dared to order. I wanted to sub something out because I have food allergies. Even though I was clear about this, my food had the item! I wasn't trying to be annoying but I could have had a severe reaction. Just be aware if you go here."}
{"text":"What happened, Kale and Clover? I used to love this place... until I walked in today and noticed that ALL my favorite menu items were gone. No more carmelized cauliflower steak, hummus and veggie wraps, veggie burger sliders or spicy Thai curry with tofu (which is been replaced with chicken). These delicious vegetarian/vegan options were the reason I kept coming back, despite the long drive. The only ones we're left with now are basically appetizers, salads and side dishes. Boring. I ended up ordering the southwest quinoa bowl, which was quite good, and the only reason I rate my experience 2 stars instead of 1. But seeing my favorite menu items disappear kind of ruined my day, as I was looking forward to enjoying one of them. Really sad and disappointed. I probably won't be returning anytime soon, unless Kale and Clover goes back to their original menu."}
{"text":"My wife, in-laws and I all are here last week and everything was incredible. I wish I could say what they had but don't remember. As for me, I had the salmon and it was so so good. Atmosphere and patio are nice and so is the staff. I'd highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were on vacation and looking for a restaurant with fresh food.  We were not disappointed.  The green gazpacho was unusual and full of tasty flavors.  The shrimp with penne was perfectly cooked (I.e. no \"rubber\" shrimp) and the crispy chicken was indeed crisp...the veggies prepared retaining their freshness.  Our son is an executive chef so we took the time to tell the cook how much we enjoyed the dinner.  He was delighted that we took the time to seek him out and said it meant so much to him.  Clearly he was serious about his work."}
{"text":"Their food is ok, though they are expensive for what you get.  To get 2 eggs with bacon and one pancake will run you $13 plus (not including a drink).  There is some unique options here worth trying.  \"The good egg\" is a much better option just on the other side of the starbucks. Have better quality food for better prices with very nice servers.  Kale and Clover, 11AM breakfast ends means 11AM breakfast ends!!!  Even a couple minutes before 11AM if someone else has ordered a lunch menu item,  you ain't getting breakfast food.  They do have a yogart parfait option instead but it's pricy too,  (2 yogarts and 1 tea is $23)."}
{"text":"It's refreshing to have a healthy option in the area.  They have Kaleidoscope Juice options when you first walk in to the left (that are reasonably priced for what they are) which is great if you are on the go.  I willllllll say....their food is pretayyyy' prettayyy' pricey.  It is tasty, and great for vegetarians/vegan (if you swing that way) but it isn't some place I can go everyday in good conscience because of the price point.  Still, it's five stars for what it provides, just be prepared and glance at the menu before.  Also, check out the patio on a beautiful day!  It's dog friendly so it's great for a fun brunch with your pups."}
{"text":"Not in love with this place. BF and I came here during an off hour, between lunch and dinner. Ordered the cauliflower wings, they were good but you would think they would present it like wings, with carrots and celery and a little ranch to pair with the hot sauce. Wouldn't order it again. BF ordered the wheat kale pesto with turkey sausage, it was good. We also got a steak sandwich, came with a side salad - we were specific what kind or dressing we wanted on the salad.....no salad dressing came with our meal.   When you go out to eat you don't want to have to keep getting up from the table to get items that should have been delivered to you from the get go.   No a fan but I can see where this place would be great for someone who is looking for a GF kitchen.   I suggest Jewel Bakery (serves meals too.)  Customer service was EH from the girl with long brown hair."}
{"text":"With the word Kale in the name I was nervous I'd be served a piece of lettuce and a lemon wedge. Boy was I wrong. We had a wonderful lunch and a great wrap I was pleasantly surprised. Glad I went in and experienced the place instead of dismissing it as TOO healthy. Great spot"}
{"text":"Having just eaten here, my tastebuds are dancing!  You order at the counter and then they bring the food to your seats. There are tons of vegan and gluten-free options. I came with two friends and so I was able to try a lot of dishes, and one was more delicious than the next! Both the Vegetable Chopped and Superfood salads were gigantic (as they should be at $10 a pop) and delicious. They forgot my apricots in my salad and were very gracious about it, quickly adding them.  I especially recommend the miso dressing.   I also tried the 'Faux Pho,' a vegetarian version.  The broth was particularly good and tasted almost like meat---very savory. The black bean tacos were tasty. Be aware, the menu doesn't list that they come on corn tortillas.  A great breakfast/lunch option in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"They were not very accommodating to someone who had a restricted diet. The guy running the counter was more concerned with visiting with the girl that was behind the counter than helping first timers. I don't think we'll be back. The food wasn't even that good."}
{"text":"I so hate to not leave a good rating, because I very much wanted to love this place. After all...they serve wine unlike Chop Shop. Here's the deal, I ordered a chopped salad and to me there was nothing chopped about it. Maybe it's just a personal preference, but big chunks of salad and not very many veggies doesn't impress."}
{"text":"The vegan options here are limited, uninspired, and overpriced. I had the quinoa tofu scramble ($7) and was so sad when it arrived at the table. It had SO MUCH quinoa (cheap filler which should've made this less than $5), edamame, red pepper, avocado, broccoli. It was seasoned but not very well. So disappointing. At the very least (one star) they didn't serve the food to non-to-go customers in disposable crap.   I also ordered the sweet potato hash ($2) which wasn't cooked like I've ever seen. The texture was not something appealing in the slightest. The potatoes where bland, barely seasoned, one-note textured (did these ingredients even touch the griddle?) with limp red peppers (who knows if organic).   I wouldn't recommend this place to a vegan, let alone an omnivore."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  I've only eaten here once but really enjoyed it.  It's following the recent trend of healthy lunch and dinner options popping up through out the valley.  Definitely worth a stop when your planning on a light evening meal."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for dinner on a Tuesday night.  Slow night. Mostly empty. The chef was  a woman we had not seen before.   Disappointed to discover the portion size has been cut in half. We both had the Seoul food bowl. Tiny portion even with my double order of protein. The rice was hard and chewy. Way undercooked. The dish was very under flavored. We asked for more of the sauce and that helped.  Also, two of the menu items we wanted to order were sold out/unavailable.  Overall we were very disappointed and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Short Story- Great Ingredients - Lovely Atmosphere - Taste misses the mark for price range. (Lunch was $34.50 before tax and tip) I note this review is based on only one lunch visit and may or may not be typical of what they normally serve.  Long Story-  Kale and Clover Mindful Kitchen is a health focused fast food kind of restaurant. You order at the counter, get a number, get your drink and seat yourself. The dinning room is open modern and very airy. They also offer a very above average patio with comfy sofas.  The fist thing I tasted was my tea. The teas are flavored and I thought the strawberry/kiwi green tea sounded interesting. I tasted it and it was just slightly flavored water that was an anti freeze color. I didn't taste strawberry or kiwi the tea tasted like water with a little green tea in it. I felt the tea missed the mark.  My favorite plate was the cauliflower wings. They were tasty but with one unbalanced herb. Would have been a little nicer if they were presented more like wings with a little celery or carrot sticks.  My lunch was the super foods salad. It was a light salad but filled with many nice ingredients like kale, romaine, red quinoa, beet shaving, avocado, almonds and lemon dressing. The salad was lovely but two things brought it down for me. One was the added chicken. The chicken was flavorless like chicken that you eat in a hospital. The other thing that brought it down for me was the lack of dressing. I never in my life got a salad with not enough dressing before so I didn't even think of asking for more dressing. The couple bites I got with dressing were much better. Most of the salad turned out to be dry. I did notice the table next to me got up and asked for more dressings for their salads so it wasn't just mine. In the end it wasn't an enjoyable salad and only was sustenance.  My husband had the Jambalaya. He said the turkey sausage in it was very good but the rice bowl was too salty for him. I never heard my husband complaining about too much salt before so it must have been extremely salty. He also said it was too smokey too. My husband also left half his food and he never does that.  Watery Tea, Tasteless Chicken, Lack of Dressing for salad, Too Salty Too Smokey Jambalaya all equal to missing the mark.  I expected delicious because I had delicious food from the sister restaurant Sumo Mayo.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet up with some friends for a casual lunch that won't weigh you down or make you feel guilty afterwards. They have a great patio dining area that is perfect for those days the weather is nice enough to be outdoors. My only complaint is that there is so much spinach (think: entire bag you'd buy at the grocery store) compared to the amount of veggies and fruit that top the salad. It may be a personal preference, but I like my salads to have a bit more substance for the price."}
{"text":"We checked this place out based on the reviews and the vegan options on the menu.  We are so happy to have found another great restaurant that serves fresh and delicious food.  We had the Kale Power Salad which was fresh and flavorful. Great large summer salad.  We also had the Southwest Quinoa Bowl that was full of wonderful flavors.    We are looking forward to going back and trying other dishes!"}
{"text":"I used to recommend K & C to friends and acquaintances - not anymore.  Sunday night we purchased a takeout order of two super salads, each with a side of salmon. The bill was over forty (40) dollars for two people. The portion was so uniquely small, I questioned whether or not they split the order.  My wife informed me (who eats there a lot) how the portion size has steadily reduced from two years ago when they opened, to the now portion size of Sunday night's 'dinner'.  When I wake up at midnight in need of a snack because the dinner wasn't big enough to feed a 4 year-old, KC, you have a problem.  Sorry K & C, you're off our list, and, I'm happy to tell anyone who's got two seconds to hear me out just what a dick move this was. You really had a good thing but blew it.  We're out."}
{"text":"The superfood salad with chicken is unreal! So yummy. Honestly, the chicken blew my mind! So happy we stopped by!"}
{"text":"This place is fresh and inviting! I loved the menu, especially that hey identify which items are vegan. The food was tasty, came out quickly, and the service was wonderful! I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Faith had recommended for me couples weeks ago and I liked the strawberry banana one. So i had that today. People who work there are really nice and friendly. I would recommend Kale and Clover to everyone"}
{"text":"The environment is beautiful - inside and out. People working were very friendly! We really enjoyed what we ordered! Super fresh, bright, and clean presentation! We also didn't wait for our food long. We will be back!"}
{"text":"For far too long I drove past this restaurant without going in. Maybe it's because I don't like kale so I thought I'd be turned off. I made a huge mistake and have been missing out! This food is phenomenal. It's fresh, it's full of flavor and there's plenty too choose from. From salads and sandwiches (they even have burgers), to my very favorite thing so far on the menu. The hummus and chicken. Sitting on a bed of hummus lies chicken , marinated tomatoes with the best seasoning I've ever tasted, quinoa and avocado. I got a side of pita but it was so good it didn't even need the pita. The only downfall is that the food is a bit pricier but you pay for the quality of food you receive, making it well worth it! This restaurant has the feel of an original Fox restaurant before they got so big and powerful. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a healthy alternative quick or leisure lunch, the staff is pleasant and give great recommendations. I actually like their food better than True foods. I seriously have food cravings for the chicken and hummus plate, love, love it. I can eat clean and not be hungry 10 min later, and have a great open ambience to enjoy it in. And in their beverages they have my favorite Waiakea water, yay!!! Great job"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful for anyone who has a gluten or dairy intolerance! So many options."}
{"text":"LOVED this spot!! The hummus is so good! I ordered a veggie wrap (it is a bit pricey, but they give you VERY large size portions!) I will definitely be coming back, when I am back in town! I wish we had spots like this where I live!"}
{"text":"So it's been nearly a year since my first and last trip to kale and clover and I must say, they stepped their game up! Last time the veggie burger was a bit bland but it was better this time, a little more sauce, less dry. And the side salad was tasty, much better than the carrot stuff I had last time. Tea was good, not too busy, nice aesthetic, and good service. My grandma enjoyed her chicken salad sandwich. Good healthy food, still pricey, but a good variety on the menu. I will be a return customer now!"}
{"text":"My absolute new favorite place!  Everything is super flavorful and healthy.  My favs:  Veg Chopped Salad (great with tofu and salmon too) & Spicy Curry Tofu.  Just tried the Chicken & Hummus bowl, amazing.  Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and immediately became a fan. The name might suggest to many, as it did to me, that this is a vegetarian place only. Not so. Yes it has a large selection of vegetarian items but it also offers a reasonable number of meat choices. I had the Seoul Food and liked it very much. I choice a beef add on and it made it all the more delicious. Certainly a place I will be patronizing in the future."}
{"text":"FRESH! The food is so fresh and healthy. I love the chicken and hummus plate. The kids serving of the rice and chicken is so good too. For vegetarians, there is a yummy eggplant panini that I could eat again and again! The staff isn't super pleasant but who cares with how good the food is! They have really great grab and go cold pressed juices and \"milks\". The one with coffee is so good! This is a great spot to get amazing flavor with farm to table, organic, gluten free, clean clean clean food. Amazing!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Tommy James & The Shondells - Crimson & Clover)  Oh Now I won't really know her But I think I could try her Kale and Clover  Ah Well I'm mindful of walking over Now I've been waiting to taste it Kale and Clover Over and over   Modern, green, fresh, and clean that's what I feel when I walk into this place.    Modern since this place is like walking into a interior designers home.  Green cause the place is organic and whole.  Fresh and clean, cause I feel like I was just walking through a rain forest that just got rained on; hopefully the interior designer doesn't have carpet haha!  I came here with my friend and we didn't know where to start, but shot for the a spicy ginger cayenne juice.  For our entrees we ordered the Kale & Clover Salad and the Seoul Food Bowl.  The ginger juice was spicy indeed plus sweet.  It was called the Cleanse and now I understand why; felt like I just went through a colon cleanse after drinking it!  The Kale & Clover Salad came with kale, apples, almonds, raisins, and sprouts with a sherry vinaigrette.  Overall, I liked the salad, but the kale was tough and bitter as it should be I guess.  Think adding another element to smooth it out would be great (i.e. mix of romaine).  The taste and crunch of the salad was perfect; apples and raisin helped with the sweetness.  We added beef to our Seoul bowl for some protein.  The bowl was filled with kimchee fried rice, mushrooms, carrots,  broccoli, bok choy, and an egg atop.  Kimchee in general is a strong flavor already.  Overall, the mushrooms gave it an extra flavor while the carrots, broccoli, and bok choy helped give this dish a crunch and welcoming subtle-ness from the already powerful flavors.  The egg for me was just an extra mellowness, but it works!    In the end, Kale & Clover deserves love and welcome from all that enjoys eating a clean and healthy meal. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a treat!  The DH and I wanted to grab a dinner, not too fancy (we didn't want to change from moving clothes) but still wanted some high quality hopefully organic with a lot of gluten free options.  The food was just gorgeous - so fresh looking (eating does start with the eyes).  And the taste - my DH said, \"if I wasn't married to you I would marry this green gazpacho\".  Yum - it was tough to share it was so good, but we needed room for our other food.  The highlight was the Tofu Thai Curry that subbed out steak for the tofu (you can add steak or chicken or salmon to any dish).  The steak was really well cooked, high quality and tasty.   We'd totally forgotten that when we'd been at Central Bistro they told us we should check this out when we were in North Scottsdale.  They were right! I can see why some folks might be disappointed in cost - I think it's difficult to set expectations here.  It looks and feels like a fast casual place - you order at the counter and then they bring it to you.  But the food quality and cooking quality are like a pricey sit-down restaurant.  If you come expecting to pay for that pricey sit-down restaurant to get this level of quality, then you're going to be nicely surprised."}
{"text":"Lots of veg and GF options but has meat for everyone. Friendly staff. Modestly priced. Fresh, healthy and interesting food without being out of most people's comfort zones. Gluten free brownies, chia pudding and buffalo cauliflower were must hits."}
{"text":"Fantastic healthy food in a friendly environment. I have the chicken and hummus and my wife had a salad and both were fantastic. we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Got take out and it was the first time trying Kale & Clover...delish. Great, light salads. I also had a chance to try their carne asada torta - 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Grayhawk.  The lettuce cups are delicious as a starter.  If I were making this dish at home, I would use extra firm tofu instead of the traditional variety.  But, if I were to make it at home it would not taste anywhere as good, so that is a non-starter.  The veggie burger is also good (and the bun is awesome).  However, if you do not LOVE chickpeas, you should opt for a different dish.  I've only tried lunch and dinner, but I look forward to returning for breakfast, and particularly look forward to trying the mushroom and spinach frittata.  The atmosphere is great and the patio is roomy; the venue is unrecognizable from its former lives.  Moreover, this place is always busy.  The high quality food justifies the fairly high prices (as compared to similar nearby restaurants)."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this restaurant as they have healthy options and is close to my home. I ordered four appetizers to go. The avocado summer rolls had no flavor they were extremely bland even with the spicy sauce. The organic tomato soup was almost bitter in flavor which is not understandable as tomato soup should have a hint of sweetness. This time of year with all the seasonal vegetables available everything should taste fresh and flavorful. The redeeming item was the Gaspacho which was good. I suggest the owners taste the food. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"So happy to support a local business that has amazing, heathy food. Tried the grilled chicken with hummus, quinoa and lentil salad, buffalo cauliflower, cheat day burger, turkey bolognese with zucchini, and all the gluten free desserts.   Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick lunch with my mom and we loved it.  I am gluten free and always a bit suspicious of gluten free bread options but I listened to their recommendation and had the chicken salad on gluten free bread.   It was fantastic.  The chicken salad was flavorful and fresh.  The toasted bread was some of the best gluten free I have had.   The portions were enough to share with my mom.   The restaurant is clean and bright - great place for a Saturday lunch."}
{"text":"Faux pho was good, but $14 expensive. I had dental work therefore needed soup and soft so it did the trick. Hubby had chicken humous w/ lentil and quinoa and that was priced well at $12 and very tasty. I liked my sons jabalaya ( turkey sausage) with brown rice."}
{"text":"If you're trying to eat healthy food, this may be the place to go.  Lots of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free menu items.  Cauliflower wings were fun.  Even the items that aren't Veg, or GF seem to be on the healthy side - like the turkey jambalaya.  I gave it a go and it was surprisingly tasty and a nice portion size.    Area is a little small and the patio is a bit iffy.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Good variety of vegetarian vegan and healthy items. Clean. Fast service. Had the K Cleanse, Avocado Summer Roll, Green Gazpacho & Super Food."}
{"text":"the food is great, the staff is nice and helpful, i like their concept and vibe.  only thing keeping this place to be a 4 star for me is the price- just a little too high for me to come on the regular. which is too bad, since i live so close to K&C."}
{"text":"Glad to have a health fast casual offering on the northern side of town. Had the Vietnamese Steak sandwich which was very tender and flavorful. My wife had the salmon which was cooked perfectly, and my dad Soba noodles which had a wonderful flavor. They even did a grilled cheese for my daughter off the menu."}
{"text":"We went here with some friends this evening. Two of us are gluten free and I'm dairy free. This place was our dream restaurant. So many options. I had the farmers market salad and my friend got the veggie chopped salad. Everything came out perfect and as ordered. My husband got the Jambolaya and cauliflower wings.  He loved the Jambolaya! It had a lot of flavor. The entire table were obsessed with the cauliflower wings!!! They were so crispy and good. The dipping sauce was perfect for them! Our other friend got the streak torta. All of the food was very good! This place will be one of our new frequent restaurants we visit! Can't wait to try more of their menu items, especially the smoothies! Also, the decor is very hip and clean. Love this place"}
{"text":"We have only had the opportunity to try the juices and milk drinks.  The prices appear to be slightly overpriced for items that may have not been prepared \"fresh\".  The wife had a brief conversation with one of the cashiers and the cashier stated all of the juices are prepared the same day.  I am positive that this is not accurate as we have been there at opening and mid-day and juices that have expired or are a few days old are being sold.  The cashiers also seem to be overwhelmed at times (waited about 10 minutes for an iced coffee).  Overall we have been happy with the juices and really hope this restaurant succeeds.  I believe some competition may make this place better as they would have to raise the bar on their service."}
{"text":"We hit Kale & Clover as it was a relatively local option for dinner.  While the menu isn't huge, there are enough options to slow a first timer down.  The staff picked up on this delay and helped ensure I understood the options, sizes, and even made a few recommendations.  I ended up going with the salmon entree, my brother's girlfriend hit a salad with salmon, and my brother ordered another entree.   The price to portion ratio seemed about right to me.  I will say adding salmon to a salad provides about the same size fish as the entree, so it comes down to 'what else' you want with your salmon.  The best way to describe the taste of the fish is to say I ate every bite.  Between the three of us, we didn't have much left at the end of dinner.  Overall, for a meal with healthy feel, it didn't set me back too much and certainly didn't leave anyone hungry.  I'd recommend giving them a go."}
{"text":"Just visited kale and clover for the first time tonight with my husband, and we both absolutely loved it!  The service was great, the girl at the cash was so friendly and informative!  I got the carne asada torta and my husband got the turkey panini.... Sooo delicious!  We also shared the cauliflower wings, they are amazing!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome! I stopped in today for a late lunch and was so impressed with the delicious, healthy menu and the excellent (counter) service.  I had the chicken and hummus and while there could have been more chicken the flavors were excellent.  I would highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I come here often when I'm home for college and typically have a decent experience. Today i stopped by to try the breakfast menu and was greeted by a worker who seemed bothered by my presence... maybe because I was in only a few minutes after they opened. When i tried to order, he let me know that they only serve eggs on the weekends and i would have to order something else. Maybe this is true but I can't seem to find that statement anywhere. More than anything, I was unimpressed with his agitated attitude."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! Great vibe and decor on the inside and they played great chill indie music. I loved how they marked what is vegan and what's vegetarian. I got the quinoa veggie burger and it was delicious. Fresh bread and overall one of the best veggie burgers I have had. I like that you order at the counter and they deliver the food and clean up too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice, clean restaurant. Cute patio. Food labeled healthy but nothing organic really. Also, I thought maybe they would have wild alaskan salmon, not farm raised. My salad was served in a large bowl but only half full with mostly lettuce. Just a couple olives, chickpeas, etc. I was kind of surprised. It did taste fresh though. I am 100% in favor of paying extra for healthy food but seeing it's not organic and mostly a bowl of lettuce I was disappointed. Perhaps It would be better if I'd chose a different menu item."}
{"text":"I love the Modern American vibe to the restaurant. So far I've made two visits. On both visits I ordered the same dish...whole wheat spaghetti and meatballs with marinara sauce. It was full of flavor with a generous amount of sauce and included about 4 meatballs...maybe 5. I don't quite remember. I thought the amount was plenty when compared to the amount of spaghetti. I really loved the dish, but wish the serving was a little bigger. I suppose it's portion controlled to ensure it doesn't have too many calories in keeping with the health-conscious theme to the restaurant. I've also purchased a bottle of Karma Juice; specifically, the Nutty Monkey, which is a drink that includes almond milk, bananas, rolled oats, pea protein, peanut butter, dates, and maca. I loved it as well. I drank close to a whole bottle along with my spaghetti so I kinda over did it. The drink is a smoothie in a bottle, but it's very fluid so not something I would really consider very satiating, but that's me. I found the outside seating to be very inviting. It would be a great place to sit with friends were it not summer. I can see the outside being utilized often come late fall. Oh, I've also tried their jambalaya. Now that dish is winner too. The jambalaya on its own is very filling. Can't wait to try what else they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Really great mix and tons of flavor. Definitely a great lunch or light dinner option. Everything is fresh. Definitely some of the more unique combinations. We had jambalaya and southwest quinoa salad. Both were great and we saw others. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food and service is fantastic! Super healthy, yet absolutely delicious! I might have to move back to grayhawk just to eat here more often. Juices are so good! The Cleanse is my fav! My only criticism would be the price. Juices and meals are a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place because I had heard good things but none of it lived up to the hype. The service first off was poor, wasn't acknowledged and the staff up front was too busy talking amongst themselves. After ordering the food Togo they prepared it and left it sitting on the counter without notifying us it was ready. Finally the salads, the kale salad was quite bland and not worth the price. The chopped chicken salad was decent but again not really worth the cost. Overall poor experience but maybe they just didn't have it together at this time."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant. I crave the Carmelized cauliflower steak. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time, and when I saw that Local Dines had a deal (pay $10 for $20 of food and bev) I jumped on it.  Didn't realize it was so far away...about 25 miles. Yikes. But still excited. The decor is awesome. The menu amazing! Staff not so friendly. And then, when he told me the certificate was only good 4:00 or after  (it's currently 3:00) and I mentioned that I drove 25 miles specifically to try the restaurant, he would not budge. The food was good but not amazing. I asked for avocado to be added in my pannini , which they forgot, and when I let them know he said he would bring some for me.  The bowl had three tiny thin half slices of avocado that looked day old.  Our bill for two people for lunch was $30 which seems high especially for mediocre food. The best part was the honey lemonade. But I wouldn't make a special trip to go back."}
{"text":"This place is a little off the beaten path for us but wanted to try something a little different than our go to, so yelp led us here to this cute little spot. Easy to order, fast healthy food. There is plenty of healthy menu choices to satisfy anyone's dietary needs."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Kale and Clover!  Delightful spot with the best black bean and quinoa tacos.  I always leave feeling like I given my body some delicious and nutritious food!"}
{"text":"Such healthy food I love how many options of appetizing food that they had. I finished my whole plate! I got the chicken and hummus and I thought it was going to be a small plate but it was not the case at all! I also received lentils, quinoa, and a side salad and they were all amazing! Definitely would come here again."}
{"text":"Kinda slow and the gentlemen working didn't even offer to get us silverware when we were the only ones there!! Otherwise the food was great! I could have the superfood salad everyday"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the juice - that was the best part for me. My salad was pretty good but it seemed like the delivery of our food took pretty long. This is one of those \"order at the counter\" places and then you sit down and they deliver to you. I will most definitely be stopping in to pick up cold pressed juice again - it was delish!"}
{"text":"It was good. I like the decor. Staff were friendly and attentive. Lots of healthy choices. Very similar to flowerchild. I had the seared salmon plate with quinoa and some arugula salad. Where Flower Child excels is having all of your taste buds firing with tasty, seasoned food. Kale & Clove fell flat here. I actually added salt and pepper, which I never do. Good, slightly pricey option in the area."}
{"text":"The valley needs more restaurants like Kale & Clover. A place that serves higher quality food in fair portions at a decent price (at least for the food). Kale & Clover has a pleasant cafe-style setup. Order at the counter. Get a number. A runner brings your food. The dining room has a modern ambiance and there is also a nice patio.  My wife and I went splitzies on a Cheat Day Burger and a Turkey Panini. The burger is perfect. the quality of beef is incredible and it was cooked perfectly. The brioche bun adds a flavorful touch. The panini probably should have just been called a sandwich. The bread is toasted but not hot or pressed. Nitpick aside; it's a delicious sandwich. Although, it felt like the chef got a little skimpy with the avocado. We both had side salads. Nothing special. A nice mix of greens and tomato with a great dressing.  The burger was $12. The panini was $10. A $20 for $10 Local Dines gift certificate (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) cut that down nicely. We'll certainly be back sometime soon."}
{"text":"I just called in my order for pick up to Kale and Clover. I love the breakfast menu (bummer it is only available on the weekends), but the lunch and dinner menu is just as exciting! The Commuter sandwich is the choice for this morning. It is big enough to share when you add the sweet potato hash on the side, but I enjoy it so much that I don't always WANT to share! The coffee and tea options are good and I usually grab a chia pudding from the ready-to-go area for a tasty snack later in the day. This is one of the places I can go with friends that have dietary restrictions (gluten free, vegan, etc) and know they would find something they would like on the menu. Overall, great fast casual place with delicious and healthy food options."}
{"text":"We just tried this new restaurant after we saw it on the news.  It is fast, healthy and delicious. We had the spring rolls which were accompanied with a spicy sauce. The Faux Pho which was gluten free and vegetarian... just the right amount of kick with fresh jalapenos and a good variety of veggies.  And the salmon with quinoa was really tasty and a nice size portion.  I highly recommend visiting this new establishment! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my new favorite restaurant. If you're in the area, you have to stop by.  Everything here is so fresh and organic. They also have a ton of different choices for everyone based upon your lifestyle!  Cannot say how stoked I am to have this place close by."}
{"text":"NomNomz: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: Casual & trendy  Wow, so glad I found this place! A hidden gem in North Scottsdale, I'll definitely be back to try other menu items.  Nomz: Excellent all around. A casual spot, with some upscale items. I asked what their top orders were, as soon as she mentioned seared salmon - I was sold. The dish is incredible, and totally worth every penny ($17). Quinoa, roasted tomatoes, green beans and some sort of lemon herb sauce mixed into the quinoa, it's beyond delicious. Their entire menu looks great, and lots to choose from. Appetizers, salads, sandwiches, protein bowls, sushi, entrees, all ranging from $8-$21.  They also have an assortment of fresh organic juices from the local company, Kaleidoscope (so yummy), coffee, beer and sparkling wine.   Overall experience: Great! The healthier options are great for a quick lunch dinner spot, or even takeout. Will definitely be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I found them randomly because I live in the neighborhood and am so happy I did!  So far I love their veggie burgers and tofu curry bowl.  I'm on a mission to try everything on their healthy and delicious menu. I also really like their stylish and casual interior and great service :))"}
{"text":"Delicious & healthy with great customer service and a delightful patio! Lots of menu options for different dietary restrictions that are also clearly labeled.  Green curry tofu bowl and cauliflower wings were both super tasty! Only downside is that it was on the pricier end of quick service food."}
{"text":"Just came here for lunch /dinner and it was so good. This was our first time here.. so we weren't sure what to expect. I'm obsessed with kale so I knew this would be my new fav. We walked up to the restaurant which was so cute and minimal with a cute patio and floor to ceiling glass walls. The vibe was super zen and relaxing. I ordered the kale salad added chicken and avo which should definitely already be in there, but besides that it was so good. Side Note: There are two types of ppl in the world the ppl who know how to make salads and the ppl who don't. They definitely do which is so refreshing. The salad was delicious and a great size. I ordered a matcha water frapp and the carrot coconut soup (probably not the healthiest but whatever it was incredible) my husband ordered the chicken panini which he loved. This is our new favorite spot I can't rave enough about it. I wish it was a little cheaper, but maybe I just won't order everything next time lol. Overall 5 stars and the ladies at the front were so nice! Great new addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Bright, fresh and clean   Interesting menu with lots of delicious food choices! Each item has a code so you know if it's gluten free, vegan, vegetarian. Super handy.   I'm not \"one of those\"  people... I eat meat. But I'm in love with the cauliflower wings. It's just cauliflower florets battered in chickpea flour and deep fried in canola oil served with a homemade hot sauce. I'm satisfied!   The nachos, yummy!  are also vegetarian and filling! The staff is friendly and always gives great suggestions."}
{"text":"Chopped chicken salad was good, service was weak. Cost was little high but it's Scottsdale. Tables were all dirty, the girl brought my salad, looked right @ the dirty table (corn/dressing) but didn't even acknowledge it or CLEAN it. 20 minutes later when another girl came out to push the chairs in & courtesy wipe the tables, she took the extra table decorations off my tablet & put it back on the other table, still didn't clean either table."}
{"text":"Have tried both breakfast and dinner and haven't had a bad dish, although I will say the turkey sausage breakfast was very salty.  Thought the basic wine choices were perfect for this type of restaurant, and the few beers they had were also well selected to be paired with most of the dishes.   Their energy drinks looked appealing but I thought were overpriced.  Check out the $10 chocolate milk in the drink case! The general menu is just slightly overpriced, but they have no competition that I know of so I wouldn't expect that to change.  Dinner with the wife was $60 with two dinners, one beer and one hot tea.  Breakfast with the family (wife and two girls) was $83!  Yikes!   My wife and daughter tried some basic coffee drinks but neither of them liked theirs. Weird feature is the hidden silverware.  Buried over in the corner next to the cream and sugar for coffee.  I had to wait in line with another gentleman while the woman in front of us finished doctoring up here coffee while our food got cold.  I guess, tell us where it is when we order or, better yet, just have it at the counter so we can take it straight to the table. Conclusion: They have only been open for a couple of days, so we expect some issues and are hopeful they will be corrected.  Because of the food my wife and I will be back.  Because of the prices we probably won't bring the kids."}
{"text":"Kale & Clover serves up a tasty menu of healthy salads and sandwiches.  This is a great place to get your dose of veggies in flavorful form.  I will say the prices seem a couple dollars high given the portions, but I can overlook that since I enjoy the Thai Noodle Salad so... HOWEVER, I have ordered takeout from Kale & Clover three times and precisely three times one item from my order didn't make it into the takeout bag so please do yourself a favor and double check your bag before leaving if you order to go!"}
{"text":"This place has a \"healthy living\" kind of reputation. Even the name infers Carnivores need not apply. But as true carnivore myself, I can assure you that everyone will find something they like in here. The vibe inside is a combo of \"whole foods\" meets spotless hillside dinner. Everything about this place says the food is truly better here! The welcoming establishment is compete with courteous wait staff who are happy to help. Start with the gazpacho from the appetizer menu and then go from there."}
{"text":"This is so me...enjoying Brandon's favorite Superfood with savory salmon! Can't wait to try the many other options to include Faux Pho, wraps and their own cold-pressed juices. I found #myhappyplace at #kaleandclover #HealthyAndHappy #thankyou"}
{"text":"So I have been here twice now - the first time I ordered soba noodles for lunch. It was tasty, although very saucy.  I would give it 4 stars.   Went again on a Saturday morning, and would give it 2 starts (thus, the 3 star average). I ordered the egg white burrito, only to be told that they were out of egg whites. My friend ordered a different item, and was told that they were out of potatoes. Apparently a truck had not showed up... In a Saturday morning! So I ordered the quinoa tofu scramble, requesting the sauce on the side due to dietary restrictions. Despite the the big sign that advises customers to advise if any allergies so they may be accommodated, I had to basically beg the guy and sign a waiver in order for him to serve the dish with the sauce on the side because \"it would taste different than the chef intended.\" I mean, I get it, but when you have allergies or restrictions that require modifications, I think it's buyer beware.   Ultimately, I got my bowl with sauce on the side and ate it plain, and guess what? It was delicious! No sauce to distract from the fresh ingredients and healthfulness of the dish.   I will go back again and hope they are fully stocked (or that someone would have the thought to run next door to frys and get potatoes). But for now, it's three stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!!! The food was amazing. I had the quinoa and black bean tacos. Delish!!! I love that they have a bunch of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options. I am going to have to make this a regular stop whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after hiking Tom's Thumb on a Friday late morning. It was pretty slow, so we went right up and ordered our meal. I got the chicken and hummus, which is a very popular menu item. My husband got the go-to turkey sandwich. My meal was average; definitely not the best chicken and hummus I've had, but I am dying to try the Spaghetti Bolognese and Kale Power Salad. It just could have used a little more flavor. I'll be back to try those soon."}
{"text":"K&C is right down the street from my work, so I like to pop in for lunch from time to time. The prices are a little steep for my weekday-lunch-liking (or maybe I'm just stingy?!), but it's a perfect place to splurge.  I've gotten a few salads that are always refreshing and delicious, but I honestly can't see myself veering away from anything but the chicken and hummus plate in the future. I've gotten it for, oh, about the past 4 or 5 times I've been here, and it's always so delicious! Perfectly grilled and portioned chicken breast, a quinoa/lentil mixture, a little tossed mixture of dressed tomatoes/avocado/arugula, all piled on top of a generous portion of their hummus. I'm picky/annoying about hummus. I love to make my own, but mostly hate any store-bought. Ordering it at restaurants that aren't exactly Middle-Eastern can be a crapshoot on if I'll like it or not. Kale and Clover's version is perfect! Smooth (but not too smooth--I told you I'm annoying), garlicky, yum. The charred lemon half they serve on the side is perfect to squeeze over the entire thing. There is nary a lentil or tomato when I'm done with the plate. It's friggin' perfect.  Their iced coffee is also a hidden gem. All in all, they are one of my favs!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful restaurant! The service was great and the food came out quickly! I had the zucchini panini which was perfectly toasted and so flavorful! The veggies were nice and thin that when you took a bite it did not squish all out of the sides, hate it when that happens. Perfect and very tasty panini, oh and also served with a side of carrot chick pea salad! That was yummy too. My husband had the Seoul Food bowl, it was good but not exciting. It was just like a brown rice veg saut√© with an egg. Probably wouldn't order again. But all of the food we saw coming out looked awesome too. Definitely worth going back. The atmosphere was inviting, clean, and lots of options for vegans and carnivores!"}
{"text":"Another salad joint. Has some protein choices that turn their bland salads into something worth eating. I like the salmon. Somewhat expensive for this type of eatery."}
{"text":"Loved it! Popped in for lunch with a girlfriend. Neither one of us had been there before. I'm vegetarian. She is not but she's a sport and we decided to share an exploration of the menu. We ordered the cauliflower \"hot wings\",  the arugula salad and the veggie and hummus wrap. The girl who took our order was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. The wings were yummy, neither of us \"do\" spicy but these were delightfully full of flavor that the wrap cooled down perfectly. The salad was pleasant to the eye and a party in the mouth. Also they put the salad in two bowls, because we were sharing. This was a nice touch and if all of it had been in one bowl I'd have to tell you that it was a generous salad. The wrap was so delicious. Hummus, avocado, sprouts...it had flavor and texture. Truly a delightful lunch. My gf tried three of the four tea/lemonade offerings and didn't care for any of them; the lemonade was sour and sweet like a cough drop; the hibiscus tasted like water with a hint of that bitter dry taste of herbal tea. I had water; it hit the spot. We will be back to continue our shared exploration of a Tempting Menu."}
{"text":"A MUST iF you are a vegetarian or vegan! Friendly and helpful staff.  I purchased the avocado rolls and the vegetable salad- holy moly it was BOMB! So many favors and I was completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is fantastic. First off, the restaurant itself is just cool looking, any place that has grass on the wall is ok in my book. Secondly, the food is awesome. I highly HIGHLY recommend trying the gazpacho soup (trust me, the soup is better than the name if you're hesitant to try something thats name sounds like the sound a sneeze makes) I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was perfectly made. juicy, seasoned, and came with a good sized salad on the side. I will be coming back often, Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch and wasn't disappointed.  This place is nested on the corner of a shopping center.  It has a nice corner patio area that you can sit in while enjoying the Arizona sun.  The menu has some delicious options both healthy and even vegan.  I opted for the steak sandwich and it did not disappoint.  All of the flavors came together fresh and tasty.  Staff was friendly and accommodating as they should be.  I'll be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... Fresh, unique and tasty smoothies and salads. Definitely pricey but worth it for eating farm fresh foods. Highly recommend for health conscious people."}
{"text":"This was very successful in the genre of \"healthy but we try to make the food good enough for you not to notice.\" I got perfectly cooked zoodles doused in a hearty bolognese sauce. It was so good that I might've forgotten I was eating vegetables for a split second. The warm staff and open, airy, naturally lit setup were added pluses that might keep me eating healthy next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Kale and clover is truly a mindful kitchen. Today is my third time here. I wanted a few data points to review since the restaurant just opened.   First, let's talk about their breakfast. I would have loved to post a photo of their amazing sweet potato pancakes but my daughter ate them so fast there was no time. They were fluffy and delicious with a lightly crisp outer edge. Real maple syrup. Soooo good. I had the acai bowl, which I've only had in Hawaii. It was good. Filed with granola, fresh fruit and shaved coconut. And then, my son ordered the turkey scramble. We had to take it to go so we could make it to our volleyball games but I was able to snap a photo in the car. I only wish I could have captured the incredible aroma. It was mouth watering. He snarfed it down but I was able to get a bite. It was heavenly! And to get him to eat vegetables was a bonus!  Such a great change from boring breakfasts in the area.   Breakfast ranks 5 stars.   Now, for lunch. I'm obsessed with the superfood salad. It's flavorful, well textured and probably has a great balance of vitamins. My only complaint is I wish there were more beets and a little more advacado. That being said, they probably have it measured our for calorie consumption.  The summer rolls are tasty and light and there's a great selection of vegan and gluten free choices.   I'm so excited kale and clover has opened in our neighborhood. They'd better get used to seeing my family around:-)"}
{"text":"Great place to go for healthy food! Restaurant has a good vibe and is always clean. Would like to see more fountain drink options or kombucha on tap and possibly some desserts. Overall this place is a good option if your gluten free and/or prefer healthier plates. Try the cauliflower wings, they are tasty! I would have given this place 5 stars but sometimes the staff at dinner time seem like they are ready to leave and/or distracted by something."}
{"text":"Great fresh food - a little pricy for salads but I love it anyway - service is alway great and outside seating is available!  Win win"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh quality organic natural and creative menu. Great for vegetarians and gluten free . Cozy outdoor casual area to enjoy your meal. I'm not a vegan, veggie or gluten guy but I like this place a lot!"}
{"text":"I waited very patiently for this place to open. Big fans of Local Bistro we knew we would be in for a treat with this place. The decor is fantastic with a large outdoor seating area - that is very dog friendly, always a perk! It's an order at counter place, which I don't always love, as it rushes me to choose what to order but now I have been several times I have a pretty good grasp on the menu. The menu - gah! Soooooo yummy! Each meal has been tasty, fresh and thoughtful. My only complaint is the choice of oil they use in the kitchen, vegetable. Gross and doesn't really fall into the line of organic and fresh eating. Hopefully that changes one day."}
{"text":"I had the Southwest Quinoa Bowl. We had spent the day and evening visiting with a great friend who'd just had open heart surgery at the Mayo Hospital. He was doing great (considering), we were hungry and we were painfully focused on how important food is to our health. The SWQB was wonderful!!! I'm one of those few to whom cilantro tastes like bar soap shavings. They left it off for me!  Had a nice red wine in a well-designed plastic 'glass\" modeled after Ridel's but with a horizontal finger dent.  Sat outside in the wonderful Scottsdale night. Arrived last minute. They were gracious.  I loved the food. My wife had the Kale Salad. She raved about it too.  Pleasant design, attractive, gracious staff and tasty, healthy food.  At one point I pointed with my fork into the bowl and said, \"This is a perfect example that healthy food, good food, can taste good, can taste great!\""}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place! The food is perfect, so diverse and so healthy. I found excellent gluten free options, such as quinoa tacos and Thai food! The vegan and vegetation dishes were very tasty.  My husband and I especially wanted to thank Hunter and Tristen! The team there is so nice and helpful. And they totally understand the importance of healthy and delicious food! I felt like I was eating at a restaurant in San Francisco. Loved the people and the food and the vibe. Also wanted to thank Savanna as well! Thank you all for making our day!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere and the menu!  I particularly enjoyed my salad and Chia seed Pudding!  A beautiful patio and the employees were wonderful!  My husband and I live in the neighborhood and frequently dine out!  We want to see Kale and Clover succeed bit we do feel that their prices apart from the salads are a bit high!  I get the same gluten free brownie at Flower child for quite a bit less in example!  Just sayin!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and fresh and really just everything you could possibly want to experience during a nice breakfast or brunch! They also let dogs on the patio so it was a delightful place to stop after hiking! I will certainly be back to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place reminded me a lot of the little eateries in Santa Barbara that I used to go to on the regular--all excellent, fresh and \"feel-good\" food.  My friend and I just moved to the area and we were looking for a good place for lunch, specifically for a good salad since that's what we were craving.  Kale and Clover has a modern twist on the cafe ambiance with great, fresh menu choices ranging from burgers, to pasta, to salads and cold pressed juices. I ordered the Thai salad with chicken ($5 extra) and my friend ordered the garden cut salad. Both were perfectly dressed and the buckwheat noodles on my salad were fantastic. Great selection of vegetables on my salad mixed in with fresh mint---mmm!  For both our salads and one drink we paid $30...not bad, though I wish they didn't charge so much extra to add a protein.  Overall, great ambiance, great food and a place we'll be visiting again for another lunch date."}
{"text":"Service is great! Patio is very nice and relaxing! The band is good, and this is a good place to dine and talk. Not too loud, just good ambience overall.I ordered Seoul Salmon, it is ok, nothing extraordinary. the Chicken Pallaird is ok. Foodwise is average. Same concept and price point as Flower Child."}
{"text":"I have to say I wasn't happy w/ this restaurant. I ordered the Greek Salad no feta and was informed that will make it vegan, perfect. I got my salad and let me tell you, for $10, there was nothing special about it. The kalamata olives were off, the dressing was awful, and there was nothing crazy great or even a little great about the salad. I also had the guacamole and chips, the chips tasted cheap, probably not even organic. I ate the guacamole by its self which wasn't too bad. Of course nobody ever came to check up on us even though we were the ONLY table at the restaurant. The girl came once and took my hubbys empty plate away (he liked his meal) but didn't say anything, didn't ask anything, as if she didn't want to be there, zero personality. Awkward. I've had the hummus appetizer before which wasn't too bad but decided to try a salad today. Never again. Sorry but there is nothing high quality about this restaurant, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and seating. Clean and bright. Delicious, fresh, whole foods and drinks."}
{"text":"What a great healthy place to eat!  You can stay there or order out, we stayed in.   Great food, great service.  Gave it a 4star only because we want to try other items offered.  That kale salad is soon good.  I had the turkey sandwich, hubbie had the Vietnam sandwich.  We enjoyed our sandwiches.  If eating healthy...this is a place to go!"}
{"text":"Very proud of their food and for the price it's just not that good. If you want a salad with protein, you're looking at $17-19 bucks and I'm ok with that if its good but it's blah"}
{"text":"My new favorite! Friendly staff, amazing healthy food and a good vibe. As a \"mom\" of two fur babies, my pups love that they can be included in Sunday brunch on the patio."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night. I had the curry sub chicken. It was yummy! Very mild  flavor. Could have used a little more kick but I didn't mind. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Husband had the salmon salad which I tasted-it was decent. Also very light and healthy tasting. He said the salmon had a touch of fishyness to it at the end. The food is healthy tasting but not to the point where it tastes like cardboard. We felt it was a little on the pricey side for a casual walk up and order type of place. I liked it because you don't feel overfull or bad after you eat there."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a healthy, slightly small portion lunch or dinner. Almost everything on the menu is amazing, but my personal favorite is the Carne Asada Torta. Only downfall is the staff is very hit or miss, in attitude, service and knowledge of the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place - their half off wine bottles and the menu is great/ my favorite item is the Kim chee rice. The decor is beautiful, and the staff is friendly. I love to recommend this place to friends and even like to meet clients here for a lunch meeting. I would highly recommend Kale & Clover!"}
{"text":"The food is good but why market yourself as \"health food\" if you are not serving organic produce and grass fed meats? I hope that AZ will catch up with CA and not serve food contaminated with pesticides etc... If this place would change to true health food, it would do really well. It is very hard to find \"clean\" food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Dog friendly patio..! Spicy tofu is my favorite .. if I ask for light on oils they are the best !! Very clean efficient restaurant... sister to Local bistro and sumo maya we love to take our pup here ( Local and Sumo don't have pet friendly patios ) The only issue is there are now no working misters outside.  They worked at some point awhile ago as I go here frequent !!    But, the  last two times we were there with our pup and had to sit outside  the staff said they don't have them. That's too bad as there are many other yummy places that have misters we go until it gets cooler out. Mind you when it's sweltering our pup stays home !"}
{"text":"Good food but lately going downhill because of excessive prices and high employee turnover. There's new people every time i go in and now there's a weird faced blond girl that has such a terrible attitude I just want to run away whenever i walk in the door. She emanates negativity and is driving customers away. The young boy who looks like a high school jock bully from a 90's hollywood flick and drives a maserati is just confusing. Does he own the joint? Anyways the food quality and atmosphere is suffering from negativity. Please fix it. Would be very sad to see this place go down and not up"}
{"text":"So happy this new healthy place has opened up in N Scottsdale. Love there food. I tried this place with a girlfriend of mine today and we absolutely loved everything we got. So much flavor. At first I was not sure if this place was going to be good. When it comes to healthy food, sometimes it's missing flavor. But no lots of flavor and big portion sizes as well. Prices very reasonable as well. You basically order your food at the counter and take your number sit and they will deliver your food. We loved the outside seating. Lots of large comfortable seating area. We will be back for SURE."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Very healthy options in many different food genres. Good food and I didn't leave feeling like I gained 10lbs. I had the pho and my fianc√© had the salmon. Both worth trying! I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Had the Zucchini Panini with a side of salad. Was really good. Good place and good service. Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I feel it's time to \"man up\" and post this not so positive take on \"Kale & Clover\"...  Must've been a financial-existential crisis: \"Are we really living in the world of the $10.00 smoothie?\" And then I blacked out.   When I came to, there was an order of the quinoa and black bean tacos in front of me. (Or was it a half order?  I'd call it \"mini-tacos.\") Ehhhhh. Fell over.   When I came to, the food was gone and there was a nice aftertaste. Being familiar with this area, I expect robust prices, but I think \"a little less price and a little more portion\" would make me feel better about these $11 mini-tacos that tasted OK but left me still hungry. (Add meat? Add $4.00) Oof. (And now that I see another's review and a much larger portion, I'm wondering how I got these very small tacos. Mistake?)   Instead of chancing the flatline again, I glanced around and found myself admiring the fresh look and the nice patio. I noticed an empty dining area and people standing in line. Wait a minute - getting woozy - why this waiting in line? A wave of \"juuust chilllll\" washed over me as I recalled how much I prefer full table service when paying the \"quality\" price point.   Definitely a nice space with nice people and good food, but if I'm gonna be price-point-passing out, I insist on resort poolside with eye-popping sunset views.   Footnote- in all fairness, they offer a $9.00 smoothie too. I've come to learn that these kinds of prices are becoming offered more and more commonly in Phoenix/Scottsdale but I still have to stand by my \"need more quinoa taco in my quinoa taco.\" Deep breath with extra meat. Ahhh"}
{"text":"An overpriced deli. Sandwiches for $12. Quality keeps going down hill and portions smaller and less side dish options. Just okay food at top dollar because it's in Scottsdale.   Won't be ordering from this establishment ever again. Ordered for pick up and realized when I got back to the office that the chips we ordered with our sandwiches weren't in with the order.   I called to complain and explained that driving back wasn't an option. Didn't seem like the employees cared at all that items were forgotten in the order and the best they could do was offer a $3 gift card. What a joke!"}
{"text":"Here are the facts:  1. Unfortunately terrible. I waited awhile to try this as people kept telling me it is overpriced and not very good....but I wanted to support local business and it was just as they said. Not impressed at all.   2.Food lacked so much flavor and I got a bowl for $17 for LUNCH and I could have bought that in a freezer section with more flavor. Just being honest.   3. Highway robbery, so much so that I emailed the company to get a refund and never heard back.   4. I did tell them that with these prices, I expect their food to taste as good as Pita Jungle and Flower Child. Now those places have good food!  Save yourself the $17 for a meal and go to Flower Child or Pita Jungle for flavorful food and at a more reasonable price.   From a fellow foodie...."}
{"text":"ok we got here and it was not super busy. the employee we talked to was super cute and friendly! i loved her. i ordered some spaghetti squash (with currants and pine nuts) it was not the most exciting food i've ever had. i also got a simple salad  underwhelming i paid $4 for extra tofu but there was not a ton there and what was there was bland and undercooked. i like what they're going for: mindful food. very (new) american. we ordered a matcha and shared it but it was super sweet and kind of thick?? we couldn't even finish the drink between the two of us because of how overly sweet it was. there's a cool grass panel but the grass is not real :-("}
{"text":"I've been to Kale & Clover once to dine in and ordered twice for pickup/delivery. I haven't been too impressed by the food and for similar menu items and prices, I prefer Flower Child. When I did dine in, the staff had a hard time getting our larger (7 person) order right, both at the register and with the food. They missed a couple entrees and then got a couple of protein additions wrong. Overall, it took too long for lunch and the staff seemed more outwardly frustrated as us for being there, than trying to get our order right.  When I have ordered for pickup my orders have been right but I just didn't like the food that much - I've tried a few of the salads, but the best item I have had here might be the Seoul food bowl with salmon (basically Korean fried rice), though they tend to overcook the salmon."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time the other day and it was REALLY good! I had the quinoa and black bean tacos. They were definitely worth the drive.  And plus their Honey Lemonade is to die for! I will definitely be back when I'm in that area. Yum!"}
{"text":"Such a fresh look. Great menu, accommodates every type of appetite. Breakfast, lunch or dinner give this \"cute\" place a try its on our thumbs up list."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating at Kale and Clover.  My husband has recently decided that he's trying to eat a vegan diet, and this restaurant offers several choices for him that he enjoys. I loved what I had each time I've eaten there, and our 3-year-old was even able to find something on the menu that he ACTUALLY ATE which is a rarity at most restaurants.  The service was courteous, and our special order item was made correctly."}
{"text":"Great food and quick service. They were out of the Karma juice I wanted so I settled on a different one. I had the Faux Pho which was very good. We went on a Saturday night and there were only a few other folks there."}
{"text":"I loved this little gem of a joint. The atmosphere is a perfect level low key, not terribly noisy so you can actually hear your dining companions during conversation- that's a rare entity these days.  Typically I have some kind of reaction to foods that claim they're local, organic, and yet contain soy, to which I am intolerant. (Can you hear that, Wildflower, Panera, etc?) but with Kale and Clover the food was freshly prepared and I had zero digestives issues either during or after my meal. I can't tell you how phenomenal that is in my life. My order was the signature Kale & Clover salad with the grilled to order chicken. Great portion, kale was perfect, dressing amazing and a great mix of ingredients. This place is on my list now!"}
{"text":"We went on Saturday for dinner. Not very crowded. There are ample seating inside and outside patio which is dog friendly. We ordered Superfood salad with tofu and curry chicken. The salad is super fresh and portion size was huge. The rice was al dente. Green tomato Gazpacho was little on the salty side but was interesting. Love the casual atmosphere and friendly staff and quick service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Today I had the shrimp pesto with string zucchini instead of pasta. It was made hot and it was delicious! Perfect sauce. Wish it has more overall, as it left me a little hungry. I wound highly recommend it if you like shrimp, pesto sauce, zucchini. Fantastic. $12.   I also got the gazpacho. It was green. And tiny. But delicious. $6.   Wish they sold soda here. Got a small drink, $3.  Pricey. Smaller than used to portion size, but everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in today looking for some vegan food and the chef was so accommodating! She spoke with me to find out what kind of burrito I wanted , and made me something delicious ! Super friendly and super yummy, definitely recommend . Also, the price wasn't bad for the portion. The coffee is good too, and they have almond milk for us vegans"}
{"text":"I read an article about this place before it opened and finally got over there to give it a munch. I was really impressed with the overall experience.   I choose the Vietnamese Steak Sandwich. It was outstanding; the grilled marinated beef was cooked to perfectiion (med-rare). It also had pickled vegetables, cilantro, mint, lettuce, and basil on it. I loved this so much I started eating slower at the end so I prolong my food-gasm! My boyfriend (the salad and salmon lover), had the Greek Out Salad and added grilled Salmon to it. He went crazy for the greek salad but when he tried the salmon I saw his eyes roll back in his head with sheer pleasure. He said it was the best piece of salmon he had ever had. How could this be, it was farm raised? Well I tried it and I understand what he was talking about; it melted in my mouth. Cooked to perfection.  We both had the slenderize juice which was red grapefruit and mint. It was super refereshing on a warm AZ afternoon. I have to admit the 50 dollar bill was a bit much for lunch, but all in all it was a great experience and  we both will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've had everything on the menu and can say it is all yummy and has that \"homemade\" quality to it. I usually have a distaste for salty food, but I love their \"chicken & hummus,\" the chicken is pretty salty, but the hummus and lentils are soooooo yummy. I also recommend going for breakfast and trying the sweet potato pancakes. The ambiance is a bit hipster/cool and there is no waiter - you wait in line and order from a big menu on the wall and then sit at a table and wait for someone to bring it out to you. The staff are always sweethearts and the food prices are fair for what you are getting. Try out their awesome and ever-changing assortment of ice tea flavors too."}
{"text":"First visit yesterday.  Great healthy food and i love the modern look and eating environment but it's too pricey.  The portion sizes of the salads is like a small lunch portion.  Add some meat to that salad and you have a very expensive salad that you could easily make at home at a small fraction of the price - which is exactly what we will do!  Value proposition is just not there unfortunately."}
{"text":"Modern upscale counter service restaurant. So glad to find 14 vegan menu items to select from. The menu offers items that are actually healthy.   I tried the Thai Noodle salad with Tofu as the add on. Comes in a large bowl for $14. It was delicious and the marinated tofu added just the right savory flavor. It's a bit pricy, but I will come again when in the area."}
