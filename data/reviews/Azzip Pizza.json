{"text":"Love this place! To be honest, usually pizza is not among the top options when I eat out with friends, but I'm glad we went to this place. Customized pizza, OMG, never thought about we could do this at CU, particularly after so many times of those regular pizzas. Also, I in general prefer thin crust, so this place is perfect for me. The only small problem I have with this place is because they have the oven out, so I think there was a bit of smoke, esp during the rush hour, which made my eyes somehow uncomfortable after seating inside for a while. So I may think about taking out next time."}
{"text":"While I wish they used fresh mozzarella instead of deli sliced cheese, the concept of this place is genius. I got a large: half Hawaiian and half Italian. It was big enough for me to bring home leftovers. For $8-9 you could get a much more substantial pizza from Papa Johns, but this place gets points for customizing."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza I've ever had!  Just try the bacon chesse burger pizza. If you don't feel good about it, I will pay for that pizza."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza. If you're vegan, like me, it's wonderful -with a gluten free option too. Great value and great service."}
{"text":"I love Azzip and recommend it to everyone. Even on Thursdays when it's outrageously busy and the line moves slowly, the staff members smile and are working well together. The crust is always perfect and the unlimited veggies are a great plus to already very good combinations of toppings."}
{"text":"Love the vegan pizza.  Best in town.  And unlimited vegetables at no extra charge.  What a find! It is great to see local restaurants provide vegan options."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely addicted to Azzip Pizza! It's a weekly (sometimes twice weekly) lunch stop for me. Super tasty and affordable. The crust has a delicious cracker flavor and the toppings are fresh and unique. My standard make your own combo is a classic pizza with red sauce, pepperoni, and olive blend,  it I love their suggested combos too - Orange and Bleu, Chicken, Bacon, Ranch, and their monthly specials. Go on Thursday for a free drink and melt in your mouth chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"Good pizza but... called and was told open until 8:00 pm. Got families' orders and drove to town, fed meter, walked to Azzip to find closed at 6:55.  Not good way to keep customers.  Follow up. Owner contacted me to apologize and make this right. Sitting in Azzip now enjoying a delicious pizza with my family. Food is great, really appreciate being able to customize pizza with lots of veggies, service is good, and pleased they want to do things right"}
{"text":"Very good pizza at a great low price. They have toppings for what ever mood you are in. I highly recommend coming in and giving it a try you won't regret it"}
{"text":"The pizza tastes really good, except that it is a bit too oily. The service is nice and the staff always welcome you with warm smiles."}
{"text":"Azzip is easily one of the best places on campus. So kind every single time. Accommodating. Friendly. Even when I'm drunk! Thank you AZZIP for such consistent and friendly service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Fresh customized pizza. Almost every day I go there, there is a Hooked deal! So lovely and kind staff too!"}
{"text":"It's pretty much a chipotle place that makes pizza. Was walking down green looking for a place to eat and noticed this new restaurant, so decided to try it out. I've been to Pie Five back in the chicago suburbs, so this is pretty much the same thing. You get to pick your own toppings and they make your pizza in front of you. Pretty neat, and it does only take about 5-6 minutes for it to cook.  I ended up making a buffalo ranch chicken pizza while the wife made a pesto chicken one. They were pretty good, and wasn't overly priced. Though I remember being a college kid and a penny pincher, and if I were still a broke and in school I don't see my self coming back here too often with some other cheaper choices around. Though give it a try, it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Love this concept. Great pizza. Love the bbq sauce w spinach, sun dried tom, mushrooms, peppers. Daught had chicken with ranch and pesto sauce, spinach amd it was incredible. Will be back to Azzip a lot!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place at least weekly. They are really nice and their service is so quick. Even if there is a line all the way to the door it is less than 5-10 minutes.  The pizza is good! I love the special pizzas of the month/week and I love the ability to make my own pizza. The Mac and Cheese pizza was so good, I'm so upset it was only monthly!"}
{"text":"They now offer vegan cheese and vegan chicken! And it's the same price as non vegan. I'm not a vegan but a friend had it and said it's awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab a quick lunch or dinner. The workers were so nice and attentive, and the price was totally worth the size and taste of the pizza. Gave me tons of meat, I feel like they could have given me half the amount and it still would have been enough! Very cool place, hope it gets good business!"}
{"text":"I would consider this a hidden gem as it never seems too busy. They make and bake your pizza very quickly. The ingredients seem to be of very high quality. Try it on Thursdays because it is free drink and cookie day."}
{"text":"Delicious! Quick pizza however you like it. Great price, $6 and change for a personal pizza with four toppings on it. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite places to go out to eat. A healthy spin on a personal sized pizza. Although this small chain primarily sells pizza, they have options for everyone. These consisting of hearty pizzas full of different meats and cheeses for your typical drunk \"frat star\", and light plant-based options for the vegan girl in your Gender Women's Studies class. The food is phenomenal, the service is quick, the staff is friendly, and the price is reasonable. My only complaint is that I wish they had more stores open throughout Illinois."}
{"text":"Good pizza made on the spot. Nice variety of ingredients, unlimited veggies. A touch on the pricey side, but worth a try if you like thin crust pizza custom-made."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizzas I have ever eaten in life. If you like thin crust pizza with freshly baked in oven thing this is the place to go. Also the option of  custom making a pizza and choosing what toppings you want is one the things I like about it. Also it's not that costly either."}
{"text":"Gluten-free and vegan options worth a visit.  It's Pizza. But with a decent red sauce, free unlimited veggie toppings, vegan cheese, and a 10 inch gluten-free crust, it's not JUST pizza.  It's fast. It's budget-friendly.  Before I eat here again I need to discover whether the gluten-free crust contains egg. I will be really sad if it does, because it's really easy to like this place so far."}
{"text":"Came here right after they opened.  Everything we tried was good, fresh, made to order.  The ordering system is a little chaotic, but i'm sure it will get better with time.  I plan on being a regular!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to give chains a 5, but mmm yum! The Pizza around here is obviously curated to the drunk college student, but not this place. I particularly love the vegan options, and they always have a special (day of the week specials). The staff is very nice and the owner cares and is equally as pleasant. I do wish they put out oregano, though."}
{"text":"The price for the size of the pizza is unbeatable! Because I'm from MD, where things are normally overpriced , I was also happily surprised with the options for toppings for the amount the pizza cost. Also the cookies are bomb!"}
{"text":"I red the reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. There is large and small personal pizzas and salads. It's easy to make a custom pizza.various sauces and toppings.a good vegetarian selection. The pizza we got were very good. Could use more cheese. I am not an extra cheese kind of guy.the pizzas cook really fast.the bacon is extra crispy .the crust is softer and had a slight taste of biscut dough.the crust is not crunchy or rubbery.we had a very good experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Azzip Pizza is literally SO good. I have been there so many times and each time I get a \"Big Zip\" for $8.22. The place is amazing and the pizza cooks in about 2 minutes. It is the build your own concept and I have never had a bad experience there. Also, I go there about 4 times a week.. Don't worry I hit the gym, sometimes.."}
{"text":"RIP Azzip. You were the best and dearest, the one I truly loved. Your thin crust pies loaded with unlimited veggies, meat, Ski and BBQ chips kept me satisfied and fat every damn time, all through college . You were heaven, perfection and delight wrapped into one. I chase other build-your-own pizzas across cities but I am yet to find something like you. You are my dream pizza place but you left us all too soon. I miss you"}
{"text":"You MUST MUST MUST try this place. The best analogy I can make is that it's the Subway of pizza places - you walk in and tell them how to make your individually-sized pizza, but they have THE BEST ingredients. Plus, it's inexpensive, super fast, and it tastes amazing. It's worth a trip to campus for a really good pizza - a fantastic change in town rather than any other place in town. This is coming from someone that loves downtown Jupiter's pizza as well as Papa Del's."}
{"text":"Excellent place to get a personal pizza that tastes amazing!!  Thin crust (love) with one meat and unlimited veggies for very cheap ($6-7.50).  Absolutely will return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Azzip is an assembly line-style, customizable pizza place. I had no interest in coming here until I found out that they make VEGAN PIZZA FOR THE SAME PRICE AS NON-VEGAN PIZZA. Do you even understand how rare that is in these backwoods? You don't even understand (unless you're vegan): vegan drunk/junk food in this town is limited to garlic breadsticks and water (Yeah, that's right. Fries aren't always vegan. Not at McDonald's, anyway). There is no stumbling to a kiosk down the block for vegan cheese-laden heart-attack-on-a-stick like we're in NYC. We are not in NYC, son.   True, it'd be cool if vegan pizza cost less than non-vegan pizza considering the fact that vegan pizza doesn't require the cost of raising ACTUAL ANIMALS, but that's the USDA for you. I'm just happy that it doesn't cost MORE than non-vegan pizza like other vegan specialty foods do.  When I found out about the vegan options here, I blew my phone the fuck up texting people who might be interested. I had to go try it. The food looked amazing in the Yelp photos.   All right. The pizza did not taste as good as what the photos looked like. It was not tasty, period.   The sauce was weak and not flavorful. The dough-- the base, the mother of the pizza-- was not good. It tasted like how play-doh smells, you know what I mean? It had the consistency of play-doh as well. I wanted to run away when I saw that they had pre-rolled a sad, flat looking piece of dough out, but I stayed to give it a chance. I only like thin crust pizza but this wasn't a crust at all. It was just unyummmy, undercooked flatbread. Good pizza should have everything on point from the bottom up.   There was no artistry in the ingredients either. At Chipotle, they have creative, proprietary blends of even their most basic ingredients. Azzip was nearly grocery store-to-pizza level of involvement. The sauces, the toppings, the spices were just meager and uninteresting.   The vegan chicken was also really bad... I've tried a lot of meat alternatives and have made my own seitan, so I can tell you that this chicken was subpar. It tasted like cleaning chemicals. The consistency was good though.   The good part of the pizza was that the vegan cheese was fantastic. Daiya is known for making great melting cheeses, and they delivered. This has nothing to do with Azzip's performance, but at least they carry it.   All in all, I would come back only because they can make vegan pizza. Not because their pizzas are made well. I added another star for this. Otherwise, Azzip would definitely be a two-star place. The food is not worth the cost, considering how basic and untasty it is."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza and the guy who makes the pizza is really polite and respectful. He is always cheerful and smile at the customers. You do not see that often in many restaurants here. I hope you all enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was a little skeptical. But I loved how clean and inviting it was when we went in. I was surprised how reasonably priced the pizza was! And it was absolutely delicious. I most definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"I first had Azzip Pizza when I was passing by one day and they were offering samples. It was pretty good so I decided to go back and give it a real try!   This fast casual eatery was pretty quiet and I was impressed by how clean the restaurant was. (I hope that when this place becomes more busy, they keep up with the cleanliness!)   I ordered a \"big zip\" and my friend ordered a \"little zip\". The staff makes the pizza in front of you and adds as much or as little of specific ingredients as you'd like. They are very friendly and will add as many veggies as you want with no extra charge!   The big zip was easily enough food for two girls and costed only $7.50 before tax (with no meat added). The staff was VERY friendly and seemed to be excited about having customers come in.   The pizza was pretty good, typical thin crust pizza. As a veggie fan, I really enjoyed the limitless veggies on my pizza! It only took a few minutes to make, which was awesome. My only 2 complaints- the cheese wasn't completely melted. It could've probably used another minute in the oven. Second, I was disappointed that there was no option for whole wheat crust.  Regardless, I was very pleased with the atmosphere, service, and food. I will definitely be back and would recommend you try it too!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in Champaign for those with dietary restrictions (and those without)!  Dairy-free cheese, tons of veggies, and they have a separate cutter for vegetarian/vegan pizzas.  Will always choose Azzip over any other pizza place in Champaign.  Thank your for thinking of vegans and vegetarians!"}
{"text":"This place is just like Blaze Pzzia. They have the same line sort of thing but I think the food and toppings are fresher. This place is all so great for lunch."}
{"text":"One of my go-to spots on Green St! Azzip is fast, well priced, and delicious. Their thin crust is always perfectly baked, and I love how you can just pile on as many vegetables as you'd like. I always get the vegan Daiya cheese for the extra $1.   My go-to order is Italian Red and Pesto for the sauce, chicken or Italian sausage for the meat, vegan Daiya cheese, and mushrooms/spinach/green peppers/red onions for the veggies."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Choose your best combination. The crust is amazing. Adding some chili flakes in the end brought the pizza to a whole new level."}
{"text":"Their pizza is very average and incredibly expensive. The toppings looked questionable as well. I was disappointed. It's like chipotle but for pizza. I actually enjoy chipotle and am willing to spend the money though because it's more filling. I wish they would offer more specials or have a more expansive menu. I'm not a huge fan of this style of pizza service anyways so if this is your thing don't listen to me."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! Tried for the first time today, and fell in love with it right away :) The pizza dough is thin and crispy, just how I like it. The pesto and garlic sauces were extremely flavorful. I have to say this is probably one of the best pizzas I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Azzip Pizza was running a promotion on Hooked last week for 50% off pizzas. I was pretty hungry after class that day so I decided to give it a try.  The line was nearly out of the door and it wasn't even 5pm yet, but seemed to be moving so I figured I'd wait it out.  I got to the front of the line and tried my best to recite a very specific order. I had a big zip which was half just red sauce and sausage, the other half was a chicken pesto with literally every topping.  Since I had two different meats, there was an upcharge and my 11'' pie still only came out to about $5.50, which was a pretty good deal, I'd say.  My more \"traditional\" red sauce and sausage half of the pizza wasn't bad. I thought it needed a little more sauce, and the sausage wasn't anything special but still alright. I feel like coming from the suburbs/Chicago my pizza standards may be a little high in general.  The other \"everything\" half was better, I'd say. The pesto sauce was pretty good and most of the toppings tasted fresh. The chicken was kind of buried but it seemed to be tender and blend well with the other toppings.  Overall it was great for $5.50 and definitely a unique concept as far as the build-your-own pizza goes, but I think I'd prefer a more traditional style pizza place if I had to pay full price at Azzip."}
{"text":"Went in at 6 pm on a Thursday and not many people there. You can get a bunch of toppings for a flat price, and the pizza cooks as fast as advertised. Tasted very fresh to me with quality ingredients. Smaller pizza and fountain soda was under $9. Might not be enough food for someone used to eating a whole pizza in one sitting from a chain place but then that itself is just no way to live. About 45 minutes after I left I could still smell a nice pizza smell on the outside of my drink cup."}
{"text":"I read a few reviews before heading to Azzip and was absolutely starving. A quick walk from my office and I was in line. It was pretty empty so I was able to walk right up. Someone immediately came over and helped me. At Azzip you build a pizza: size (big is 11\", lil is 8\"), sauce, meat, and veggies. A lil zip was more than enough for me (it comes to about 6 medium sized pieces) and it was only $7! They let you have as many veggies as you want so I got plenty of spinach and tomatoes. I waited about 5 minutes and my pizza was finished! Checkout was super quick. The pizza itself is pretty good. There wasn't a ton of sauce but the sausage was good and the overall taste was very pleasant. Not the best pizza I've had but this is probably the best pizza on campus and you cannot beat that price. Hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"This place was great! It just opened up on green street a little over a month ago.   The pizza I had made was great it has barbecue sauce and pulled pork and topped with crushed up barbecued chips and drizzled with sweet soda syrup which I thought was strange but it was quite good!   Very reasonable price too, $7 for the small which was more than enough for one sitting for me.   Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I called last Wednesday, to make an order for pickup. The man on the phone informed me that their pizzas take a mere 2 minutes and 20 seconds to cook & that I would be much better off coming in to order it so it would be fresh. \"How precise!\" I initially thought which changed to the realization, that they might be making their pizza in a microwave! When I walked in, the smell reminded me of subway which made me a little anxious about my decision to try this place. I went with ranch sauce and chicken. I like that they list the farms that provide their meat. That's a nice touch if you care about where your meat is sourced. When you walk up to the counter, you basically find yourself at a sandwich line but instead of loaves of bread, there are two sizes of pizzas. I saw a girl busily rolling out crust so that's a good sign that it's made fresh in store and there's also a real oven. When the woman at the line started assembling my pizza, it soon became painfully obvious that it was probably her first job ever in food service. She was soooooo sloooow and needed instruction from some of her more seasoned coworkers. I went down to the cash register to pay. The employees there also didn't seem to have much experience ever working jobs. The girl on the register didn't really know how to use it and she busily chatted with the girl who boxes and serves the pizza. What felt like way more than 2 minutes and 20 seconds later, I finally was walking down the street with my pizza. In the end the pizza was definitely bursting with flavor but Azzip Pizza is just another fast casual chain and I'm not sure it's worth going out of my way for it. There are only two sizes and they're both pretty small and designed for one person so don't expect to come here with a large group of friends to socialize or anything."}
{"text":"My new favorite place ever. Great as a snack to share or a meal. So healthy too!!! I love the option of endless veggies. This is the best thing ever. The service is friendly too."}
{"text":"Restaurant review Although Champaign does not have a Blazed or Pie Guys, Azzip comes a close second. It is a chiptole version of thin crust pizza. You step right up and select the size of your pizza and the associated sauce. I went with the italian red which was a bit under powered in spice/flavor. You get to chose one meat and each additional one for 1 dollar, finally you get unlimited veggies. I found that the selection was quite limited with spinach, sundried tomatoes, baby portobellos (however they are so finely sliced), and green peppers. Avoid the chopped garlic and onions at all cost as the oven does not cook them well enough and they end up tasting raw. Overall I actually was impressed with the thin crust even though it lacked the crunchiness and smokey flavors you get when cooked over a brick oven. For a quick meal inexpensive meal you can't go wrong with Azzip pizza.  Pros: Inexpensive, quick, customizable pizza  Cons: Lack luster sauce, not cooked in a brick oven, very thinly cut veggie ingredients  Hidden deals: Hooked app gets a big pizza for a little zip price at dinner on some days  Health code rating: A. Clean report. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=2305"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! It is a different type of pizza. I personally love this place because of their pizza-bar where you can customize your pizza. For the pizzas, you can choose from a variety of toppings, sauces, and types of crusts (gluten-free or regular in 2-3 sizes). They also have cookies and salads. If you like thin-crust pizza, this is great. Also, if you like to see your pizza being made in 5-10 minutes it's great. It doesn't pack on as much of the crust as regular pizzas would, but that doesn't bother me because I don't like extra pizza dough anyway. It's a must-try especially for those with dietary restrictions!"}
{"text":"Went there when it first opened. Friendly staff. Good idea about the pizza, poor execution.   My friend and I both got too much sauce on our pizza that it overwhelmed a multitude of toppings. I paid $8 to eat tomato paste. I've had other friends report the same thing about getting too much sauce. Perhaps we all got the wrong pizza makers, but it's enough to discourage me from going back."}
