{"text":"The food was great and the place too. Kind of empty for a Saturday night. The service was also great, the lady that served us was very friendly and funny!

The dishes vary between 4 and 7 dollars, some portions are smaller than other, but I ordered a fried rice with shrimps and I has more than satisfied. 

Definitely recommend the place! Great food, great place, great prices!"}
{"text":"Um yeah. I'd bet hands down that every other Asian would call this place out for what it is: Manchu Wok with chairs. The food is over-salted, drenched in oil, and the waving cat in the window looks like he could use a tune up. Poor waving cat. 

The only reason this thing is still in business is because it's the only Chinese restaurant within a 2-foot radius of Spadina and Queen. But if we all shift our gaze 2 metres to the north of us, we'll find a magic dining palace called \"China Town\". As the name implies, you will find ample dining options that serve some of the same things on Steamy's menu... but this time, it'll be edible."}
{"text":"This place is currently open for lunch but as of Monday, they will have Tapas and dinner options as well. 

The atmosphere has really improved since the new owners have taken over. It looks fresh and lovely and everyone is so friendly. 

I love the buffet Chinese style where the food actually tastes delicious, unlike that processed, greasy grub you can find at other Chinese buffets. Their prices are reasonable and you leave feeling very full. 

I look forward to Tapas!"}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful find. After a day spent at ROM and tasting sake and beer in the Distillery District, we were hungry and wanted something good. We saw the sign and ran right in. 

The service was polite and prompt. We tried the appetizers tasters plate, which was okay. I wouldn't order rolls by themselves, I don't think. We did have the veggie sweet chili rice noodles. They were really good, and actually spicy. The really spicy plate was the spicy fried rice. It was amazing. We added the shrimp on top. We had two orders of the grilled shrimp with chili-lime sauce because the sauce was amazing. The calamari cakes were really good too. The sweet potato fries were tasty.

We also each had a beer. We ate quite a bit and drank, and the bill was just over $70, which was very reasonable for four people."}
{"text":"I have walked past this restaurant many a times without actually setting foot in it because it was always closed. Then, one fateful night my friend needed to vent - and we were on a hunt for a nice spot to eat and drink at.
After failed attempts, this is where we landed and I am so glad we did.

The service was impeccable - he was friendly, polite and prompt - and it as almost out of place because it was not a white-linen table sorta place, and I certainly didn't expect it, but surely was welcomed.

It was very quiet place too - there were just 2 full tables...maybe that accounts for the amazing service?

I had the appetizer taster, which came with 2 kinds of hot rolls and a cold roll. The presentation was awesome. The hot rolls were awesome.  The cold rolls? not so much. I love cold rolls and while the taste wasn't too bad - it only had noodles and shrimp - no carrots or lettuce or cilantro - and it was loosely wrapped that the contents threatened to fall out after the first bite.
 The entree was okay. I thought the proportion was a bit on the small side when I first got it; turned out to be the PERFECT proportion. I think the reason I thought it was small was because I'm so used to getting a mountain load of food when I go to a Chinese restaurant that, what was actually a \"normal\" proportion looked small to me.

The price wasn't that bad either - in fact, I'd say for the amount of food I had and the excellent service - it was perfect.
Now that I have their business card, I'm going to try the tapas for lunch- stayed tuned!!!"}
{"text":"I have walked by this restaurant many times, always wanting to try it, but always with other plans already made. Yesterday, plans were changed. 

We came in, where greeted by a very nice waiter, and shown to our seats. He told us a bit about the menu and asked us what we would like to drink. I glanced at the drink list and quickly noticed $3 beer. Woot! The happy times began. 

Next, to the food. Tapas is awesome if you have never had it. You get a small dish, for a small price, so that you can get multiple things. Perfect for anyone, like me, who has a hard time making food decisions. 

Between two people, we shared 6 dishes; all were spectaciular. The presentation was artistic, and the taste was full of flavour.  

I was happy when I left, and will be back; often.

Have I mentioned the $3 Beer?!"}
