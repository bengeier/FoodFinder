{"text":"For a Sushi Place that's run by Korean's well I will have to say that they did a DARN Good JOB when we went there for dinner last night before heading to a Blue Jay's Game. I have had incredible sushi that's for sure but for the location and the price that Sushi was great. Service was great, we got Soup, Noodles & Dessert \"Compliments of the House\" If  I'm ever in the neighbourhood I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This place is just alright.  The owners of the restaurant are Korean and I feel that Japanese people make the best sushi. The Sashimi plate was pretty reasonably priced, but only consisted of the basic fishes. I only came to try it because it was next door to my hotel. I probably should have done more research and found a better sushi restaurant.  I hear Toronto has many good sushi restaurants. They were pretty nice though.  However, the restaurant was also pretty slow on a Thursday night.  Mind you, this was at 9 pm at night and there were maybe only 3 tables eating."}
{"text":"Grand Ichiban Sushi just opened on the West end of the entertainment district.  The restaurant was spotless clean with a warm bright feel.  The fish was fresh and delivered quickly to our table.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Will definitely go back.  Great place for dinner before heading out to a movie or nightclub."}
{"text":"i just got take away for lunch here. their veggie selection is pretty minimal. i know sushi is dominated by fish but just because i hate fish doesn't mean i should have to make do with just 2 or 3 options for vegetarian sushi. it's like having going to a pizza joint and having the \"vegetarian\" (mushrooms and green peppers) as your only choice when there's a whole new world like broccoli, red onions, hot peppers and other glorious vegetables out there. enough rambling, i got the imaginitive cucumber & avocado roll. it was too big for one bite. sushi rolls should be made small enough that you can shovel it in in one go without looking like you're going to choke to death. too much rice and pretty boring. that's about it!"}
