{"text":"Pigged out here a month ago and I'm still full. The family ordered 2-clam strips, Fried shrimp and cheese sticks. Good amount for the $."}
{"text":"The hispanic woman at the window was by far the worst customer service I've EVER received. The food was ok. I went there on a Sunday I believe because Pete's fish and chips was closed (I love their fish squares and their sauce) so I decided I've passed by here plenty of times before why not try there. Big mistake. So I went in the drive through, i ordered fish(cod) and shrimp and my sister ordered the BBQ wings. So 23 minutes later, YES 23 MINUTES!!! And we are still there, so around the 15 minute mark, I started waving at the lady attempting to get her attention and she would smile and turn her back at me while she was on the phone. So another 5 MINUTES passed and I decide u know what I'm just going to have to go in so as I'm putting the car in drive she comes to the window and is like \"how may I help you?\" so I'm confused at this point and I'm like I'm still waiting on my order from 20 minutes ago is there a problem with the order? She gets an attitude like \"20 minutes? It has not been 20 minutes the wings take 12 minutes to cook\" I'm like I have my receipt right here with the time I paid, so she looks at my receipt and prints a new one from the register and says the time right here says it's ONLY been 19 minutes your food will be out in a second...... And I informed her 19 minutes is damn near 20 minutes and needless to say after a couple more minutes of me and her debating and me begging the Lord himself to give me strength to not go in there and whoop her ass, the cook brings my food out and apologizes for the wait my fish and shrimp were hot af but the chicken that took \"12 minutes\" \"the reason why we were waiting so long\" was barley warm...... Wtf..... Never again I promise never again"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the last year and I can say that these guys have stepped up their game. The guy in the front was telling me how they got all new fryers, a new flat grill, and a new charcoal grill. He recommended the double cheeseburger with natural cut fries...OMGGGG was I in for a treat. I've always called myself a burger aficionado and have always been on the lookout for a good burger. This burger is GOOOOOD!!! Maryln's is the spot!"}
{"text":"Ordered the wtf pastrami, was definately wtf, not so much pastrami. It was incredibly bland and had weird textures. Chicken sandwiches are alright and gyro was okay. Everything looked kinda sloppy but they did rush it to my house within 25 min. Yelp's eat24 gave them an hour so i kind of wished they took their time."}
{"text":"Maybe they were just having an off night. We ordered online and said the food would be ready for pickup in 10-20 min. It was 40 min. Finally get back home and find that the whole order is wrong, except the drinks. Everything we asked for was the opposite of what we got.   I paid for extra toppings and didn't get them. We asked for medium burgers, got well done. Asked for no tomatoes, got tomatoes. We just ate everything since we didn't want to drive another 20 min round trip and they were closed, so we couldn't call. Don't think we will give them another shot, too many mistakes on the first try."}
{"text":"I delivery order from Maryln's. It was fast and amazing food. Love their Fish and burgers!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"In town for the first time and saw this fish and chips place. Stopped by and the guy behind the counter was the most courtisious.  I had the whiting and shrimp and I must say it was one of the best spots I ever had. Glad I drove down the wrong street."}
{"text":"went today on a chance that it might be the same place that used to be at 7th st & maryland. it was!! the service was terrific, the cod was terrific, the place was clean, the pricing is incredibly fair. a bit busy at 1:00 pm though. i will return. she has another place at 10th st & buckeye. thx for the good experience oshea."}
{"text":"Stopped by a restaurant on Camelback to pick up some of their Teriyaki sauce and met the owner. He proceeded to give us a card for a complimentary meal and told us to give it a try. We loved their flaky, delicious fish. Their were extremely courteous. Treated us like family and they have a Grade A from the Health Department, which is wonderful in my books.  The establishment was so clean and didn't smell of fish. We are definitely new customers."}
{"text":"Went here last night. Place was not crowed at all. Wondering what it would be like. They have 4 choices of catfish, talipia,cod and whiting. We had catfish and shrimp and cod and shrimp. It was all very good. Best catfish I had in a long time. The fries were not real good. The shrimp was good. We also got the fried zucchini. That was the best I have ever had. I will be going back very soon. I recommend this place except for the fries."}
{"text":"Very tasty cornmeal  crusted catfish..Extra star for the super friendly service by the young lady who took our order. My brother and I are LE retired, we noticed the neighborhood is a bit risky with more than a few opportunists hanging around outside eye balling people looking for weakness..Be alert , and get some tasty fish.."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, and wasn't disappointed! There was a very friendly woman working the front who made the experience wonderful! And the philly and fries is a must try."}
{"text":"Loved. We ran into this place on our way to the Suns game. The environment rocks, everything we ordered was delicious and the kid working there was nice and funny. If we are ever in this area again we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Get fish. My mother -n- law wanted a sandwich. One of her last fish sandwiches and I'm thankful this place had a great one to offer her. Will be return as much as possible to honor her memory."}
{"text":"First time there last night, thanks to yelp! I loved their fish sandwich (cod) and their butter pecan ice cream is so delish!! Sam wss super friendly. We woukd definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We've ordered here more than a few times for work. They are prompt and error free with some of the best food! Love it!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Friendly people and very good food and the prices will invite you to return.  I've tried several items on the menu but I keep going back to the cod fish and chips.  They also offer catfish and tilapia fish and chips.  Another favorite of mine is the shrimp and chips.  I work in the area and have found this to be one of the best place to eat.  I eat here two and sometimes three times a week.

Maryln's is family owned and the owners are always there."}
{"text":"Great fish and shrimp.  We ordered the cod and shrimp.  Generous portions!  The service was great and very helpful.  I was confused about the breading on the fish though.  We ordered the batter but it seemed like we got the corn meal coating instead ... however, it was good all the same.  I would definitely make the trip to Maryln's again."}
{"text":"Food is good! But my husband and I have been there twice in the last month and have found a big strand of hair (both times) deep fried in our shrimp! Thought we would give it a second shot since what were the odds of it happening again! Welp we were wrong! Super disgusting will  not going back there for sure! It's a shame since the food is good but apparently the cook doesn't know how to wear a hair net!"}
{"text":"Mike from Chandler, AZ

I work in South Phoenix, and I found out from a local in Phoenix, about Maryln's.

I went and got to try out some of there food is real good.  A place I would recommend when driving down the street South Central Ave.  They make there food fresh to order and have a nice selection of things to chose from the menu.  The food is reasonably price.  If you are in to seafood give them a try.  Maryln's is worth it."}
{"text":"Great fried food! I wish they had clam chowder. The food is pretty similar to Pete's fish and chips."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner here on 10/12/14 we both ordered the catfish combo and she ordered some oysters on the side food was not good at all catfish had skin on it. And was rushed cooked I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great service and delicious food. I ordered tenders, onion rings, and clam strips that were mouth watering. The best place to eat in Phoenix. I'll be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place lived up to the reviews. We split a double burger and the 4 pc cod fish and chips. I especially liked the spicy cocktail sauce. The breading on the fish was thin and it surprised me how meaty the cod strips were. The fries were strongly seasoned (thumbs up!) The staff was friendly and food reasonably priced. We'll likely be back."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had Bruh! And they gave us some fried Oreos and it was great! The service we received was very friendly and he made us feel welcomed for our first time eating there. The only sad part was that we didn't order enough food. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I came to Maryln's thinking I was in the mood for some fish and chips, I guess I was wrong lol. As soon as I saw someone eating a burger I had to try one. I got the double cheeseburger with pastrami. I probably should've gotten a single, TOO MUCH FOOD! The atmosphere is great, also Kool aid on tap, ask them for one of their mix's and thank me later. Also you have to try the Maryln's sauce, it goes on everything. Whoever made this sauce must be a culinary genius. I will be back here at least once a week, I love the feeling of eating with family and that's exactly what you get here."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in that part of Phoenix and she really wanted Fish & Chips.  She cooks a lot of fish at home so she really knows fish.  We went in and met Sam, the owner.  Very friendly gregarious man.  Also we noticed a group of what appeared to be local men having lunch and just shooting the breeze.  Very friendly atmosphere and very clean.  Well, the fish was GREAT!  GREAT! GREAT!, and combined with the friendliness of Sam you can`t go wrong.  VERY REASONABLE PRICES.  Also, I was told that Sam uses the highest quality ONCE FROZEN WILD CATCH ALASKAN COD.  This fish is straight from the Bering Sea, no preservatives, no fillers.   Highly recommended that you eat there tonight and you will surely make it a habit!

{"text":"Enjoyed the catfish and the fried Oreos.  The place looks clean and organized and the staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"O'Shea has got to be the friendliest most attentive guy I've ever met behind any counter. The food is reasonably priced and hella good! Go see this hole in the wall, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food and on top of that great service. And definitely get the fried oreos!!!"}
{"text":"great fried seafood!, also they have fried okra!!
Definitely will be coming back!
Thought the Kool aid on tap was Kool too!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and chill atmosphere, great prices and by far the best in south Phoenix if not the whole Valley can't wait to have the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"These guys are good!! Not only their fish but the rest of their menu is ridiculous !!! There delivery service puts them over the top!!! It's about time someone did it like them!! Great job guys"}
{"text":"Was looking to try a new place for dinner and Maryln's did not disappoint. I ordered the 3 piece fish and 4 piece shrimp and left stuffed, great portion sizes, and very reasonably priced. Not to mention great customer service from the entire staff. And they have kool-aid! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is in the hood but the food is great if you like fried fish I mean the best, they have wonderful customer service also so don't judge the area it's in. Just needs a better or a second location because it's hard to get real good seafood in AZ."}
{"text":"The fish and chips here are about the same as you'd get from the frozen food section.  Nothing to get excited about.  The portions are large but the quality is meh."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get fried fish and Shrimp in South Phoenix. Service is excellent alway with smile. Location clean. Food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Wow...after all these years of reviews I finally give my first one star.  Went to Marylyn's this evening and am writing my review barely an hour after purchasing \"dinner\". Yes, it's fried food- its not meant to be haute cuisine I get that, however this food was not even edible.  Firstly I went through the drive thru and it took a good 12-15 minutes to get my food so that was a strike before I even allowed the potential biohazard pass my lips.  I ordered cod and chips, clams, fried mushrooms and onion rings.  I had to throw out the fish, 'shrooms and rings because they tasted like poo poo.  They had a strange funk that gave me the feeling that to eat them in their entirety would bring on a horrid case of \"the runs\".  The fries and clams were edible (I just hope they don't detonate in my small intestine later tonight).  So how bad was the food?  After throwing out the majority of what I paid $17 for at Marylyn's I drove over to Taco Bell and bought \"pretend Mexican\" to get the putrid taste from my mouth. Yeah I needed the frankenfood created by Senor Taco and Senora Bell to remind me that sometimes while thinking fish and chips (UK Comfort Food) is impossible to screw up...even the impossible is indeed possible.  \"Danger Will Robinson\" \"Danger Will Robinson\" Danger!  Danger!"}
{"text":"Ehhh! It does have a drive thru but I still like Petes better.   I do not have anything nice or bad to say.  I just think some people might love it and others not so much.  I pass on this one!"}
{"text":"For those from Phoenix- if you've ever see \"The Wire\"-the gang members are always eating \"lake trout\" sandwiches. Well, in everywhere but Baltimore, that fish is called whiting. If you miss a good lake trout sandwich- they got your stuff. Otherwise, best catfish in Phoenix. By a mile."}
{"text":"I've been complaining recently how crappy fish & chips restaurants are out here because nothing really stood out. My old favorite place, Good Guys Seafood, has closed down after a very short tenure, so I thought I was out of options until someone online recommended this place. 

Fish & Chips aren't really something I crave all the time, because its just fried foods and I'm not a big fried food eater anymore. But I seen the reviews for this place and had to try it. 

It's a little ways away from my place (East Mesa) but occasionally we travel a little bit to try a new place. 

It's a pretty small place and I like that. The staff was incredibly friendly. I ended up getting the 3 shrimp/2 fish combo. The prices are pretty typical for these types of places. The food, was, decent. Its only fried fish, so its not gonna be anything incredible. They give you an alright amount of fries, could be a little more, but it was a $7 meal, so not to bad. The tartar sauce they give you (you can ask for more no charge!) I don't know if its handmade, or from a carton, but it was the best tartar sauce I've had and I'm not a tartar sauce guy. It was so sweet and addicting and a good french fry dipper. The place kind of reminded me of Good Guys Seafood that I mentioned earlier, except Good Guys gave slightly bigger portions. Overall though, I'd probably visit this place again. Maybe try the pastrami sandwich or a burger next time."}
{"text":"Maryln's Fish & Chips is one of my go to spots! This little gem is in the south side of Phoenix! They have a variety of foods from fish and chips , wings, Philly cheesesteak, gyros and more. The food is always delicious and the customer service is always top notch. We like to get fish & chips (catfish), wings. I would also recommend the wtf fries and if you like them spicy, you can add jalapeños. The prices are fair in my opinion for the quality of food you get. They also have dessert and a pretty awesome variety of cake, and pie slices. Maryln's has Thrifty ice cream as well so I would say that this place has something for everyone in the family. The space inside the restaurant is not too big so if you wanted to bring a group of more than 5 it would be tough! The inside is nice clean and modern. I definitely recommend this place to all"}
{"text":"Great quality food and service. The fish tasted fresh and didn't upset my stomach later on like other low quality fish places can.Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fish guy but I read the comments here and had to try it. I got catfish and shrimp combo. Got to say it was BOMB!!! Loved it!! Customer service is on point."}
{"text":"Nice place. Clean. Friendly staff. Food was prepared fresh and timely. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"First time here... We checked Yelp and then went on a whim because it was Thanksgiving eve and we were so busy cooking we forgot to eat dinner.  I got a cod sandwich with coldslaw; my hubby got a fish & shrimp combo. We both enjoyed our food and thought the cod was fried just right and seasoned well.  We called in our order, and got there in 15 minutes. Our food was ready to go.  I only gave 4 stars because it was my first time there."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! I love this place. My Saturday is mostly spending downing wings, burgers and fish!! Must try!!"}
{"text":"Made my first visit last week. Clam strips were average but the cod was fabulous! I'll be back . I want to try their pastrami sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been to many fish and chip place in the valley,but all of them are sub-par. They all either have low quality fish or generic batter and are proud of their product! I thought I had a decent fish & chip restaurant called Mandy's and that's just what they were \"decent\" but 10 times better than Pete's. Then the Brother in-law of the owner of Mandy's opened a Fish restaurant called \"Maryln's\". 
  
  Maryln's fish is top quality and they have a option of the regular seasoned corn meal batter or the owners special seasoned pancake batter!! The seasoned pancake batter is the BOMB (very good)! The fish selection is also great. choices from cod, catfish, whiting or Tilapia. If you order a fish sandwich then your really in for a treat. the bread that is used is baked fresh everyday in the bakery that is in the building! No other (and I mean no other!!) fish & chip place uses fresh baked bread. The fries are seasoned well and taste great! Plus there are many other seafood and non seafood option to satisfy anyone taste (burgers, shrimp, wings and desserts).

  Now on to a important part, The SERVICE. The regular staff is mostly family members, another woman, and a helper/ guard. When the Owner is there then your in for a real treat. He is extremely friendly with customers often times giving out free sample to customers if they are unsure of his food! He actually cares what you think of his food and will change something if you don't like it. Once when I walked in he was in a meeting with a beverage distributor. He was unsure about what new drinks to ad to his offerings, so he actually asked me to join in on his meeting with the distributor! He asked me which of all the drinks he had a option of would I drink if he carried it. I chose Snapple and he told distributor to start bringing Snapple with his regular shipment! Talk about having customers in mind! He also like to chit chat with customers and get to know them. all around great guy and sometimes funny.

  The restaurant itself is kind of in a bad location due to the fact you have to do a U-turn to get in the parking lot when heading northbound. also parking is limited but once you get inside you will be very delighted. The restaurant is  very bright and clean. even the restroom is clean! There are 2 huge flat screen tv's on the walls. Plus The employees are happy to hand over the remote so you can watch something you'd like to watch! Easy to understand menu and large selection of drinks and great food what more can you ask for? For the hands down best place to get some fried fish head to Maryln's!!"}
{"text":"Best fish I've come across in town with prices that demand repeat visits. Puts pretty much every fish and chips place I've scoped out in Phoenix to shame. It's an eccentric mix of southern style fried foods, tasty Philly cheesesteaks, superb pastrami and the most heavenly fish and shrimp.  

 Although, it's an iffy place to stay in and eat because even with amazing food, tidy interior and great folks behind the counter offering excellent service there's this guy who \"works\" here that just skulks in and out of the place that keeps turning the TV on and off to drown out people that make the mistake of sticking around to talk. Not clear what he does other than scowl at people and make the place tense, but the food is absolutely taking the trip out to pick up and thankfully they have a drive thru to bypass going inside."}
{"text":"Had the fish & shrimp combo. The catfish had a nice even crust and flakey white meat. The shrimp were big. Fries had a nice light seasoning. As a side got the coleslaw which was pretty good. And Kool-Aid... that's different!"}
{"text":"These guys are good!!! It's hard to find great fish and soul food that is made just for you. These guys def know what they are doing and Their delivery service puts this place over the top of their competition !!$ it's about time someone did this and I'm Glad it is you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Just happened to be working in the area and clicked on my Yelp nearby button. It was a Friday and what more could you ask for other than some tasty Fish.

This is one of those restaurants that you would not typically go to unless you are in the vicinity or knew about it before coming here. The building is pretty old and they are located in an older part of PHX.

They have an interesting menu with all sorts of fried critters as well as burgers, pastrami sandwiches and even the famous Philly cheese steak. Nice!

Ordered the 3 pc Catfish / 4 pc Shrimp dinner and a side of Jalapeno Poppers. The poppers were stuffed with cream cheese and came with a side of ranch. The fish dish came with french fries and a side of tartar and cocktail sauce.

Really enjoyed everything that showed up on my plate. The meals were simply prepared with a very casual eating area to enjoy yourself. Both the catfish and shrimp were tasty and I'm looking forward to coming back again in the future.

This is not one of those high end eating establishments and you can even hit their drive thru when you're in a hurry. Just kick back and enjoy a cool mom and pop restaurant where you can actually see the family hard at work.

See ya there next time when I'm in the area. Who doesn't like a big basket of fish and chips when you are hungry and just can't resist the craving. FISH FRY TIME!

{"text":"The food is so good! It's not often that places live up to their hype, but Marlyn's certainly does. 
First off, their location is great, the restaurant is clean, bright, and welcoming. Our cashier was great, gave us plenty of time to decide what we wanted to order (it was our first visit). We ordered a burger, BBQ wings, and fish and chips, we chose cod. 
The burger was great, huge for the price we paid. The wings were great, crispy and seasoned. Whatever barbecue cause they used was phenomenal. Now to the best part, the fish and chips. We're usually a pete's family but after eating here, marlyns will be are go to place for fish and chips. The pieces are huge, they're made to order, and the breeding is phenomenal 
Hands down, Marlyn's has set the bar high for any other fish and chips place. I can't believe it took us so long to check this place out. We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"They have great service! Their cat fish is the best fish in Phoenix. I've gone to Mandy's down the street but it just isn't as good as Marilyn's! I'll be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"There is no reason (none) to cook at home when you can get fresh, hot, and perfectly cooked fish at Maryln's. It's not fast, but good things come to those who wait. Friendly service, excellent food, great prices! Simply the best!"}
{"text":"They have the best Fish in town!. Every time i eat there the food is served fresh and hot and perfectly made. I recommend to go there and try it. You will not regret it. They even serve my favorite desert fried oreos which taste amazing! They have fresh bread and meat for there sandwiches. They are fast at delivery always on time and most of time before."}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment a few times. I have found that the pieces of the cod  fish vary notwithstanding identical two piece orders. The fish is a little dry. The one thing that is consistent is the place is skimpy on fries. This last time I found the fish portion even smaller. I am no longer willing to pay $2,50. for each piece of fish they serve. The 2 piece fish order. in my opinion, is a rip off."}
{"text":"Honestly all their food from the wings to the fish to even the gyros are really good. Some of the best fries in town too. I don't think they have a bad dish."}
{"text":"The service was curtious. The food was great and tons of is very large portions. The WTF fries are awesome, fish/cod was nicely done, the triple buger was yummy and you cant fit it in your mouth. Great"}
{"text":"Totally suprised by this place. It looks like nothing special from outside, but its a jem. If it werent for Yelp, I never would have tried it. The place is easy to miss....so look out. Positives: clean, well set up, good customer service, affordable, tasty food with variety. Drive thru available or sit inside. Negative? Didnt have more yoom in my tummy for these tasty bits.
-tried cod fish, calamari rings, bbq hot wings and okra=all good. Give it a try."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California n had to Google fish locations and this one was the nearest location 30 min from our hotel . No hesitation we made this trip and let me tell u this fish is  so fire great place we will be back next time we are  in town for sure. Its better than our fish in Long Beach cali lol"}
{"text":"Great  I actually got to full off  the koolaid. I ordered fish and shrimp fried crispy and they did just that for me. I cant wait to come back and try the juicy burgers they look delicious."}
{"text":"This place continues to amaze me. My husband and I first strolled in for ice cream and left with fish and chips! Since, we've tried cod, shrimp, oysters, cat fish, and the burgers. I am not a sea food fan, but I'll take an order of fish and chips from here any day! The batter is perfectly seasoned, not too over bearing. I love the fries...tonight we had the burgers. I have to admit...I was skeptical because burgers at a fish place aren't that great! My was I surprised. 1/4 pounder charbroiled to perfection! 

I've yet to have ice cream :), but it's okay. Next time I'll add some fried zucchini to my order!"}
{"text":"Ok, I am pretty new to the area so I have not tried too many fish spots  so I can't compare too much, but I do not know why anyone would try anywhere else in the south part of town for fish and chips(ok maybe just for the misters to stay cool at that other place- you know where I'm talking about all over town- the patty cake place ) but this is a MUST try spot in town. Ok, maybe this is not your part of town, but worth the trip to south Phoenix. A little hole in the wall, but Great food, and very friendly staff. I could go on and on, but try it out for yourself, because I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is always consistently good. It's the only place to get quick and tasty fried seafood. The cod is delicious and the food comes out fresh and hot. Not fancy or complicated."}
{"text":"So i read some great reviews but that is not what i got! Except for the delivery guy he was sweet and cane 10 minutes before the actual arrival time

My burgers where all cold the bun was hard none of the extra stuff i ordered for got cheese on all 3 burgers My french fries where soggy and cold and they still gave the wrong drink but now i know and i will not be ordering or visiting here anymore
Im just utterly dissapointed !!!"}
{"text":"So this is the first time I've ordered from this place. I got the catfish, shrimp and fries. I LOVE it! The cheesecake was a little small but maybe that's a sign I need to shed a few pounds, haha. The delivery was fast and I am very pleased with my meal!"}
{"text":"I normally don't eat seafood but when it comes to this place I can eat it all day every day! Incredible quality and amazing service, the food is always hot and perfectly seasoned. Must try it!!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chip spot. Fish is not greasy and the fries are on point! Skip Pete's and come here instead!"}
{"text":"Love the seasoning they put on the fries. I've gotten the shrimp and chips twice and I'm addicted. So good! I want to try their hot wings next time. The guy that helped me with my first order was awesome. I placed the order through the app and meant to choose the 10 piece. When I arrived, I realized I only chose the 5 piece and he had the rest done right away. Everything was hot and fresh and extremely delicious. I'm not a kook aid lover but I saw they have kool aid \"on tap\" ha!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to have some great comfort food, it's hard to find good fried food but this is the spot to check out. The fish is so good u can't have just one piece. I love the COD and the fried onion rings. I recommend you try it. The apparently use fresh fish that is not frozen because when you take a bite it melts in your mouth. The neighborhood is quaint and up and coming but overall good choice to try."}
{"text":"I visited Maryln's fish and chips on yesterday after finding on yelp. As a native Californian, I am always looking for a food fish place and so far this has been my best experience in the valley. I had the 3 piece catfish special with the fries and it was very tasty. The restaurant is very clean and open ans the staff is friendly. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"While waiting for my car to be serviced across the street, the BF and I decided to walk over here for lunch. From across the street we saw about 5 cop cars in the parking lot and my BF said \"It must be good if there is a bunch of cops eating there\" lol.

I got a basket of 2 pcs fish (cod)  and 3 pcs shrimp and the BF got the 3 pcs fish (2 cod, 1 catfish) and 4 pcs shrimp. We also got a side of hushpuppies to share. 

I like how you can choose what type of fish you want (cod, catfish or whiting). The fish batter was light and crispy. It wasn't at all greasy which I was afraid of. It was long pieces of of fish filets, not no weird square shaped patties. I was very pleased with them. It came with tartar sauce and a spicy red sauce. I liked it with the red sauce more. I got to taste a piece of the catfish and thought it was quite good, as well. It had a cornmeal batter and was comparable to what you would find at most southern restaurants. The shrimps were also tasty. They were of decent sized and cooked nicely. Hushpuppies were yummy, too. 

Our baskets came with fries and a drink. The fries were seasoned with seasoned salt. Nothing fancy but they were fresh and crispy. Our meal for two cost us about $25. Pretty good value. I would come back here if I'm in the area. 

Yup, definitely go where the cops go. lol."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through grub hub. Food was pretty hot and the order was mostly right.. Fish n chips n shrimp was very good. Cocktail sauce better than mandys. Only reason i didn't give 5 stars is cuz i got sweet potatoe pie when i ordered cheese cake for dessert. But the driver acknowledged it and said he would bring pies complimentary next time. I'll order again!!

 Funny side note my order came in a churches chicken boxlo. My bfs in a regular non colored food box. We found that funny.."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a quick bite or to go order.  Not special, but not bad."}
{"text":"If you are a Louisiana transplant and miss fried catfish from home, this is a decent quick fix!  I want to try other things on the menu, but I can't ... the 2 piece is just enough for me; but if you do the fish and shrimp, they do a good job there, too!"}
{"text":"I seriously do not understand all the 5 star reviews for this place, but this is yet another establishment that leads me to the conclusion yelp needs to somehow programmatically weight ratings based on what you have reviewed and and what others have.

It's just not that good.

I get it, it's a fryer joint, but it just leaves much left to be desired.

I ordered a ton of things here when I was very hungry and needed something quick to bring home for the fam:

Fish and Chips
Shrimp and Chips
Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich
Clam Strips
Zucchini
Okra

Not one thing was good... I ended up tossing it all.

The philly was disgusting. I've literally gotten ones out of a vending machine that required a heating in the microwave that rival this in quality and flavor.

Fish and chips was lackluster, but the best of the bunch. It's a small step above Gortons, and I mean small.  The fryer oil had to have been deteriorated as it had an everything flavor too it that was undesirable. The fries sucked... soggy, frozen, blah.

The shrimp was over cooked, and by the looks of it just some crap frozen butterflied food warehouse crap.

Clam strips where way over done and just tasted bad... they definitely gave up the flag of dirty oil.

Zucchini and Okra were just slop.  Mushy, no seasoning before they were battered.  Just a total waste of money.

I wasn't expecting to be blown away with quality, but I at least expected this place to be relatively good at what they do, especially considering the ratings on yelp. It's just a fryer and some really bad ingredients prepared with apparent apathy for quality.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the burger.... bad decision. The burger was sloppy, the baghad grease all over it as well as the wrapper for the fries and burger.... way better quality elsewhere will not be returning...for burgers, fish or anything for that matter!"}
{"text":"We found Maryln's on groupon and since we were taking the kids to the drive in movies and were in the area we decided to give it a try... Well as we first started pulling in we thought wtf... It reminded us of the Detroit MI area we just moved away from and We almost turned around, but happy we didn't! This place is fantastic! They had a lot of options including corn meal instead of flour batter which was so cool because my husband has an allergy to flour/wheat.... They're shrimp was a lil over done, but they were huge and juicy and their cocktail sauce was awesome!!!! It had a nice spicy kick and I even used it to dip my fries in;0) the man that helped us was very nice and when they accidentally made one of my husbands catfish battered in flour he went back right away and made another piece no hassle even when we said it wasn't a big deal! I had cod and my husband had catfish and the pieces were huge and delicious!!! My kids all got chicken and fries and an order of jalapeño poppers and they were happy and ate it all!! We brought our 3 kids, my husband and I and spent $24 total and couldn't be happier!  We live an hour and a half south and don't know when we will be back in the area, but if we are...we will be going back!! Oh and when we do return I'm trying the philly cheese steak I was way to full to get one to go, but next time it's on;0)"}
{"text":"Not bad

Maryln's Fish and Chips has a very large menu. They offer everything from fish, shrimp, wings, chicken strips, burgers, sandwiches, clam strips, calamari, oysters, fried chicken and all the usual fried side items.  

Maryln's offers three kinds of fish, Cod, catfish, and tilapia.  I ordered the two piece cod.  My entree came with a side of fries.  The combo and a drink was a little under $10.  The meal was good. The fish was served hot and fresh as were the fries.  As I said the fish was good,  just nothing really stood out, it was a typical fried fish. Marylin's even offers four different flavors of Kool-Aide, I haven't seen that in many fish places. I think my nephew would enjoy their drink selection.

The staff at Marlyin's are very friendly and accomdating and they have a menu online and you can order for delivery."}
{"text":"I didn't get oily or soggy items. The bag was still steaming hot when I drove off. The fish was hot and not soggy at all. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I held them up and they stood up straight, not soggy or oily.
This is my first time here for the fish.  8 pcs of fish AND fries with fixins are cheaper than 8 pcs of just fish at knock kneed, which is my favorite. This place is convenient with a drive thru, they take cards, and employee was very friendly. 
They have a bakery in the back where they make their buns and pastries fresh. I come here for their hot dog buns. Soft pillows just like bread used for Sonoran hot dogs. The place is nothing fancy but the bread is something special and somewhat of a secret.

Dine local, shop local."}
{"text":"Best cod!!!! I enjoy eating here! I like their shrimp and their burgers! Worth the trip or even have it delivered which works when I'm super busy and I can get it without any hassle :)"}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for 5 years and knew nothing about this gem. The fish and chips were excellent, the dipping sauce was awesome, and the guy at the drive thru window made us laugh. I won't be leaving south Phoenix anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was looking for something to eat around the area and found Maryln's. I read a lot of good reviews, so I figured I'd try t out. 

My husband and I arrived at about 8:30pm and was greeted by a very friendly gentleman. We ordered at the drive thru, but after we placed our order, we asked if we can just dine in instead, but the gentleman said they were closing soon, so we said it was okay. No biggy, understandable, we came a little late.

There are 3 different kinds of fish to choose from: Cod, Catfish and Tilapia.

We ordered: 

2 piece fish and chips, Tilapia
3 piece fish and 4 piece shrimp combo, Catfish
4 pieces of jalapeño poppers
1 order of fried calamari 
1 large black cherry kool-aid

Both fishes were very flaky and had the perfect crunch. Each piece of fish were huge, especially the Catfish. For the shrimp we got the butterfly shrimp and that was good too. Loved the fried calamari. As far as the jalapeño poppers, eh it was alright, but I wouldn't order it again. Also the tartar sauce was soooo good. I usually don't care for tartar sauce, but their tartar sauce was delicious! 

Overall, the food was great and the service was great! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are a steal and the appetizers are awesome. Love the fish and chips the most though!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!

Crispy fried fish and fries just the way they should be served. The fish is fresh, not watery or greasy. Hubby enjoyed the two piece cod basket and I had the catfish basket. Basket includes fries and a roll. We also bought coleslaw to share which we didn't need because there was so much food in the basket.

The restaurant was clean as a pin. From our view at the counter the kitchen was spotless.

Cost for lunch was $18 with two drinks and tip.

Definitely on our \"we will eat here again\" list.


Just made our second visit. Same great food, same great service."}
{"text":"Been eating here for last 15 years. Best catfish in city and would highly recommend. It's so good I've followed them from 7th st to central ave and now to 10th st and Buckeye..."}
{"text":"Ordered twice more since the first time and it's a hit with my guests. The catfish is excellent, as are the lightly battered fries. Love the triple burgers too. Everything is very good, keep it up!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in Maryln's :(...
Went in on Friday 10/27/17 for lunch, after telling my best friend/ sister about this place, and what do I find? No chicken !!! I was not able to stay and enjoy a good lunch because no chicken and limited items available on the menu due to limited ingredients in the kitchen :(
SO VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED!!!
Will not return EVER!!! and risk not being able to eat anything from the menu if not sure kitchen is stocked up!!!
Made me look like a food, had to find another place to eat at, last minute, and no compensation offered !!!!
If I could I would give this establishment a negative start!!! 
NO LONGER ON MY LIST OF FAVORITES!!! and have lost a loyal customer!!!!"}
{"text":"Found them searching for something that delivers and did not disappoint. Fish & chips, calamari and wings were great and the WTF fries... Wow! Great service. Will definitely be calling again."}
{"text":"I tried three things here: fish / shrimp / wings.  Added a side of coleslaw which sadly ended up being my favorite part.  Here's why: it is indeed possible to cook something in oil without completely saturating it.  When you have soggy fries, soggy oily fish, decent shrimp and fresh crisp coleslaw - it's not hard to understand why the only thing not fried was my favorite.  Of course I knew everything was going to be deep fried - but if your oil is fresh and you pay attention to your temperatures, these things don't happen.  They were friendly and the food was prompt, but in this case that's just not enough to sway the vote."}
{"text":"They food is perfect for take out dinner. It's nice to have such yummy food that is prepared when ordered and delivered hot. The catfish is delicious. And I love the kool-aid on tap. Lol. I've never seen a place with kool-aid on tap. Awesome."}
{"text":"This place is going to put Pete's Fish and Chips out of business. I have had everything on the menu food is delicious the desserts are delicious love that they have Kool-Aid number one fish place to go to now"}
{"text":"Best Fish  and Chips I've ever eaten. Owner and staff are super friendly and helpful. Place is super clean definitely recommend this hidden Gem just south of down town Phoenix. Try it out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Saw that this place had good reviews so I checked it out after hiking the Holbert Trail over at South Mountain. Similar to other fish & chip locations in town, but quality of shrimp was really good and everything was hot and fresh. Great taste! Would return here no problem. It's easy to drive by this place so keep an eye out for it if you're looking. It's on the west side of the road."}
{"text":"I have been a fan for years since the 80's of this kinda cooking! Well at M's store on the south side you get great service,  agreeablewait times & a much more food then you anticipated! Now listen & a lil reminder to all of you new age, feel good peeps. Ass, Grass or Cash Nobody rides for Free, they deliver but it will cost you baby! You can really get your rocks off with a tasty touch & brilliant frying of Catfish & chips over here! Love yourself with the wings, I prefer parmesean garlic & Meds Xtra crispy. This meal, not only is it one deep fried example of how to eat like a king on a budget that WE use everyday but for now just tell rest of them to fuck off & get their own!"}
{"text":"Hard to imagine that as good as Marilyn's is that there are only ten Reviews here. Okay, so the neighborhood is not so good, but I have been there in the morning (11 AM), afternoon and evening and all is well. Just now Reviewing and NOT certain why I have waited so long. Maybe I just didn't want share. 

The fish? OMG, the best! Have had all three varieties of Fish (Cod, Catfish and Whiting) but being from Boston, COD is my absolute favorite and this is the very best \"Fried Cod\" I have ever had. Don't generally like Catfish, but Marilyn's is terrific! Want to try ALL three, get the three pieces with one of each and you will know which to order next time. The Owner has tremendous pride in what he does and obviously, that can be seen in his \"Product.\" NOT fond of the Tartar Sauce, but doesn't matter because the Fish is so extraordinary. Unlike most Fish and Chip joints in Phoenix, the do NOT use the same batter on everything. Makes a BIG difference. Can't go without ordering Fish and Chips, so have only had Shrimp as an additional Menu Item and they were excellent.

You just can't go wrong and if you are like me, you will get a craving every couple of weeks. FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"Awesome food even better service ! I stopped by here after hearing so much about it and it did not disappoint ! For anyone who hasn't tried this place I would highly recommend to stop by . Tried the cod with Okra was fresh and crispy !"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover. The food is delicious.  Inside is clean and the workers are really nice. You can tell the food is freshly cooked."}
{"text":"I got the Gyro and Mac Salad it was awesome! my son got the Cheeseburger fries and cheese sticks.. IT was so good... Love the thrift ice cream and Kool Aid.. thanks Guys! i will be coming back with delivery order soon.. thanks again !"}
{"text":"First time I have to say its better than Pete's fish and chips, I don't know why I never stopped here but glad I finally did.... I'll definitly be back  friendly and welcoming place,  my order was a carryout and by accident they forgot my burger and they guy was so nice and brought it to my house that's customer service, for that I have to say I'm glad to be there new customer..........."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking good!! Don't let the exterior fool you! The people working here have always been super friendly and helpful. The food takes a minute to cook as it's cooked fresh to order but I'll never mind waiting a little longer for delicious, fresh food! The hamburgers here are some of the best I have ever had. The bread is so soft it literally melts in your mouth. The onion rings are amazing and the jalapeno poppers are the best. The chicken is high quality and breaded to perfection. Oh and their homemade ranch is the best! can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  The onion rings were totally fried crisp, no onions in them.  The chicken wings were over-cooked also.  The delivery was quick and very thing was well wrapped.
."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars so I have a 4 
This is my first time coming to WTF after seeing it on the news as a great place to eat. I thought the staff was very friendly and I really enjoyed eating there and I rarely like eating inside fried food spots.They were so kind as to bring me extra shrimp with my order just as a courtesy and I thought that was really cool. It's really nice how they combined like four different restaurants in one spot so you have many options and the Kool-Aid along with other soft drinks is a great touch. I'm very familiar with fried fish and shrimp as my family used to own a restaurant when I was younger. I would say everything was overall tasty especially the fries however the shrimp and the fish had a little too much coating. Shrimp and fish are light textures so overload of coating and seasoning can seem a bit overwhelming. Overall, it was good I would just say a little less would've went along way. My husband and I definitely decided we will give this place another try and maybe update our score as well."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place.  Ordered fish and shrimp plate, side of okra, onion rings, and clam strips.  The cornmeal breading was not seasoned.  The clam strips were good.  The okra was bland, which was disappointing as that is a favorite side dish of mine.  The shrimp cocktail sauce was not even a quarter of the way filled in the tiny cup, but was tasty.   Overall I thought was okay.  There wasn't really anything that was delicious and stood out as something I would crave to go back for."}
{"text":"Great food & awesome service! There are so many tasty choices! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this spot for 2 years now and it really is one of those hidden gems. I highly recommend everyone try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Amazing Fish and Chips (I ordered a 4-piece of cod with fries), the fries were seasoned perfectly, and the fish had the perfect texture and consistency with a nice flaky outside. Looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Prices were good. They are very very Thrifty with the Mount of sauce I give you. And when they give you a small container of sauce it is not even a third full. Did find a few dark pieces in the fish I did not like that. I also think their combination should come with a little coleslaw."}
{"text":"Excellent little joint. Don't let the name fool you. Yes excellent Fish and Chips, your choice of Catfish, Cod or Tilapia. I've had the Cat and Cod both very good. They also make a Great Pastrami sandwich. Philly also  good. Wings too. Don't forget the $.99 cone! Ad it to your list!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!!! I grabbed the 2pc cod, 3pc shrimp and fries all for under $9.00. #DEAL"}
{"text":"I first tried this place in the summer when I was working nearby. I am familiar with the family that owns this restaurant and love fish, so I tried them out. I got the 3 shrimp and 2 cod meal with chips and it was great. Love their cocktail sauce! It's got a spicy kick to it. I could do without the chips, nothing special about them. The jalapeño poppers are delicious. I recently purchased a Groupon: paid $15 for $30 worth of food, a good deal. I suggest eating the food ASAP as it is not the same when reheated. 

All in all, I recommend this place to any one in the area looking for friendly service and a great meal."}
{"text":"The fish and chips here are so delicious!! Maryln's Fish & Chips is very welcoming and clean restaurant. I will continue to go back there for more services! The prices are reasonably considerable!"}
{"text":"I don't go eat fish and chips too often but this food was pretty good. I got the catfish, fish and chips plate. It was very good. The food came out in a hurry. The fries weren't anything special, i wish the seasoning was sprinkled more generously.  The workers and maybe owner, not sure. Where nice people and talked us up, gave us some 1 off coupons. I want to try different things they have on their menu as well.

The catfish was good, came out freakishly hot and be warned, don't bite into it, break a piece off and attack cautiously. The breading wasn't in excess, it was enough to give that flavor and crunch, but didn't over power my catfish flavor. They have tilapia, whiting, and shrimp as well. Their vinegar tomato sauce deal, was eh.... and tartar sauce i wish had more kick. That is what really prevented them from getting a 5 star. 

i will come back because it is right next to my work, i love little mom and pops like this."}
{"text":"FRESH, FLAKY, FLAVOR this is how I could describe the FISH! I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem of a restaurant here in my old neighborhood.  I currently live in Seattle and have been spoiled by the fresh seafood of the Pacific Northwest.  I actually think Maryln's is better than anything I have tried in Seattle.
Soem have made negative comments about the fries.  We have been here twice and have had 2 different kind.  Once, wafftle, the other was thick cut.  I have no problem with either. they were both great.
The young man (son of the owner) working the drive through is a customer service oriented worker.  We had time to chat a bit, since all orders are made to order!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great food and spectacular customer service! Especially the little guy working the front register, Amir! So sweet and kind. Do yourself a favor and try the Fried Oreos! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and fast. Food came out hot and fresh. I will recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"I'm just here for the kool-aid! The food is pretty standard, but I'm boring because all I order is the calamari and mozzarella sticks every time because that's my fav. 

The kool-aid is great it tastes like heaven and diabetes. They have different flavors, but my fav is red!!! I like strawberry kiwi too... try it out, very affordable spot."}
{"text":"Great wings! Thanks so much for sponsoring lunch for our school's Teacher Appreciation Week."}
{"text":"Great fries and I LOVE the breaded mushrooms. Thanks again for sponsoring lunch for the teachers at PCA!"}
{"text":"A perfect surprise!  Central may not be the safest looking place to stop and eat, but this place was amazing. The guy at the front was super nice (sorry, forgot the name) and treated everyone like vip customers. Food was great with all fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Ordered the 3 shrimp 2 fish combo. The fries were tough and had the texture of microwave fries. The shrimp was great. However, I requested catfish and I'm almost 1000% sure that what I got wasn't catfish at all. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"If I could give Maryln's 10 stars I would right now! This the place to go for the best fish and chips ! And the best chicken strips! There were 3 different types of fish to choose from and the chicken was perfectly moist and friend ! The service was superb and the place very clean ! OMG and they have fried Oreos!! AND they have Kool-Aid on tap !! I'll definitely keep coming here !"}
{"text":"Originally, we were going to go to Pete's for fish and chips, but I remembered that my friend recommended this place. As we walked through the doors, we were greeted promptly so that was a nice welcome. It was pretty dark outside but the restaurant was well lit and very clean. We were given menus not only to order but take home. I like to sample different items esp when it's my first time. The menu allowed me to choose a few different items and it didn't break the bank. We were told upon ordering that since the food was made fresh, there would be a little wait. We did notice it took about 40 min for everything to come out but was entertained by the t.v.
We started off with the jalapeno poppers and fried mushrooms. Yummy!! My main dish was the Pastrami sandwich and although it was good, the bread was so soft that it fell apart as I was eating it. I also shared a plate of fish and shrimp with my husband. Let me tell you that I don't care too much for  fried fish, but the batter on the catfish was great. It was evenly spread, flavorful and had a great crunch to it. The shrimp was huge and had good flavor. I was sad I didn't order this as my main meal. I actually ordered a burger too, but was stuffed from all the food and had to take it home. I haven't had Kool-aid in ages so it was refreshing to wash down my food with it."}
{"text":"Delivery in South Phoenix is usually terrible even with big pizza chains. Pizza is usually the only thing that delivers too. 

They have a wide range of food from burgers, wings, philly cheese steaks, and seafood. The wings are really good and the pastrami is amazing. 

Every now and then they have fried oreos or other cool things to try."}
{"text":"OMG! Maryln's Fish & Chips needs a billboard. After reading the reviews; I had to see for myself. Man, I tried a few items.. 
Shrimp&Chips-must have with the Red Sauce, Tilapia&Chips-Mouth watering, Catfish&Chips-Super addictive, Mozzarella Sticks w/Ranch Dip-the batter is perfect, Onion Rings-Sweet & Nice Crunch, Kids meal chicken nuggets&fries- my girls loved it!  Topped it off with a 0.49 cent ice cream cone. I'm a Cali. Girl and those who know Cali. I felt like I was at the Redondo Beach Pier eating fresh off the boat seafood.  I will be back for more."}
{"text":"a great fried fish that I've been tried for a long time! Worth to try for sure!"}
{"text":"First time today...prob my last as well.
Placed order thru Yelp, got confirmation via email. 
Picked up at drive thru, came home, took pictures. 
Sat down to enjoy my food...temperature was perfect, quality not so much.

I really wanted to love this place, but can't give it more than 3 stars..

If you look at the photos, you can compare the quality of the clam strips I got today, to what was posted 2 years ago..huge difference. They were way overcooked and it seemed to me, they ran out and just used the tiny scraps at the bottom of the bag for my order. Not cool.

The cod was chewy, also overcooked, felt like it was twice fried. 
The only thing I did enjoy were the fries and the red sauce that came with the order...also service was fast."}
{"text":"I was headed to a more familiar fish & chips place down the street for a snack, and then noticed that the police were eating lunch at Maryln's -- usually a good sign in my opinion. So I stopped in at the drive-thru where the very polite owner took my order. His son (couldn't have been much older than 12) then greeted us at the pickup window, and he too was very nice. When the owner realized that we hadn't actually offered fish, he insisted on adding a complimentary piece to our order so we could try it. I thought this would mean a small bite, but nope; it was a full fillet of tilapia. Service was all-around excellent, especially for a drive-thru experience.

I drove off happily with my clam strips, okra, and tilapia, plus chicken nuggets with fries for my son. Everything was quite tasty, including the spicy cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, and the ranch (it's the runny style that I prefer). I shall most certainly return, and next time I'm ordering fish. Oh, and I learned from a neighbor that the name is indeed a typo -- owners decided they liked it that way, so they ran with it. Ha!"}
{"text":"Smh... licking my fingers.. Hands down the best.. I looked and looked. 24th st and Jefferson boom!! There's not many places like this in the valley!! Must try!! I'll be back!! Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Excellent food, especially for the price. Clam strips were delicious, fish is fresh and perfectly breaded. Tartar sauce was amazing! Good fast delivery!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food! The fish and chips was by far the best tasting in this state. The rest of my party tried the gyro and burger and they thought it was amazing as well. Every thing about this place was awesome, the food, the atmosphere. I had a really great time and enjoyed the company of the owner. He took special care of my entire party, and you don't get that kind of special treatment anywhere else! If I could rate this 6 stars out of 5 I would!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great food and amazing customer service.  Two fish combo; 1 with catfish the other with cod, oysters, Hush puppies and okra! !! Food was fresh and pretty fast. Pricing are very reasonable as well. If you're in Phoenix this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Best Fish and Chicken in Town !!!  Kool-Aid on tap !!!
Good Customer Service !!!  Everything tastes homeade and is delicious ....  Variety of Selections ... Good food at a good price ... And did I mention the Kool-Aid !!!"}
{"text":"I went today for lunch. It was my first time. The gentleman working the counter was very pleasant and attentive. I like that you can choose what kind of fish you get with the fish and chips. The food was served hot and fresh in about 7 to 10 minutes. 

The breading was different than anywhere I've been before. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. I believe it was corn meal based. The fish meat was very tasty, not dry or undercooked. All in all, I was quite satisfied with this little place."}
{"text":"Hawaii born resident - visiting Arizona eating a great tasting Cod fish n chips with a great price to go along with it in the middle of the desert  and can't think of any place back in Hawaii that's better ............. something must be wrong....    Lol!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best!! Very satisfied .!! My husband brought some home one day and it was the best philly cheese stake I have had in a while. I also tried the wings and they were also very good. It is definitely a go to. I give it a 5 star bc the environment there is friendly and also the restaurant is very clean. And of course THE FOOD IS AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"It's so good here... We would go to Pete's fish and chips, but by far this is soooooo much better. Will be coming here forever and ever.... The quality and quantity you get for the price you pay it's unbeatable."}
{"text":"Service is above and beyond excellent, restaurant is really clean and kept up, the food is superb 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I literally had to create a Yelp account just to attempt to steer other innocent people away from this restaurant.  Based off of the reviews, we thought this would be a good place to eat, but that was simply not the case.  The food was old, soggy, and mostly not what we ordered.  We ordered the 10 piece fish and shrimp with fries and cole slaw, all of the fish was to be cod.   What we received was 10 pieces of assorted fish, definitely not all cod (if any of it was), that appeared to be sitting around for at least an hour.  It was chewy and devoid of any flavor.  The fries were a similar story.  Despite ordering the cole slaw, we received potato salad that was sub par as well.  The meal was unequivocally worse than any I have had at a Long John Silver's and you would be better off going there for a meal."}
{"text":"This place has the best food. We loved everything we ordered.
I highly recommend the cod and the wings. The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Having lived in South Phoenix for almost a decade, I thought I had found all (okay, at least most) of the cool places to eat. Maryln's is definitely a local secret that needs to get out. The food is fantastic! I had both the cod and the catfish as I was being rather indecisive that day. On my second visit the service was just as great as the first. Love finding cool local places like this that still take pride in their food and establishment."}
{"text":"Wet to try out some fish and chips and we were pleasantly surprised by this little gem.  The fish was made to order so we knew it was fresh.  When it came to the table we were blown away by the portions.  We both got the $7.99 3 pc and couldn't finish it.  That just doesn't happen with us.  We can eat!  The place was clean and the server was a super nice gentleman.  He asked everyone's name which made it a personable experience.  It was 30 mins away but we'll be doing it again and heading up to South mountain."}
{"text":"My wife and I are new in town and we're looking to get our fried fish fix. A co worker of mine mentioned the place so the next opportunity we had we jumped at it. Staff was VERY friendly and inviting and even addressed me by name after he learned it. Food was hot and kook aid was great. Fries had good seasoning also. Definitely would go back to try something else on the menu. Great job guys."}
{"text":"Bomb.com

They must use high grade secret batter. It's just too addicting. After eating there couple of times it's just been absolutely amazing every time. The food is always fresh, cooked right and delicious. Definitely recommend for those who haven't tried it. They even deliver"}
{"text":"To me this place wasn't that great. I ordered a two piece catfish and the batter was super thick, staff were inattentive and no where to be found. It seemed pretty popular as the parking lot was full. I didn't even eat half my meal before I got a little disgusted for spending the money and hopped up to toss the mess in the trash. I'll pass and stick to Pete's Fish and Chips!"}
{"text":"Really tasty. I ordered the  fish and shrimp combo it was pretty good the catfish was very well cooked not greasy at all which is usually my first complain about fish and chip spots. Second thing I worry about is usually the fries but the fries here were good, not amazing but tasty and most importantly didn't tasty like it was fried in fish oil which is gross. The fish was battered perfect and flaky on the inside I loved it. I also ordered a gyro which was pretty good. Overall I'd probably order from here again for some fast fish to go. Although one thing I will say the different styled takeout boxes through me off a bit and they had a Texas restaurant insignia which made me think where these boxes came from. But overall I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best Fish & Chips place we have ever had!  The Jalapeño poppers are the best!  You can't go wrong with the fried fish or shrimp.  The WTF fries are a must try. All their sauces are homemade.  This is a gem in the desert.  This place looks great inside and you can tell that it translates to it wide selection of food.  Glad to discovered this place, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Saw this place driving home from South Mountain & decided to make a u turn and try it - just out of curiosity. SO GLAD WE DID!! The people here were super friendly and attentive. We got wings, okra & fries... Great prices and to be frank - good as hell!! My words won't do them justice so just go try for yourself! Then come back, give them their 5 stars cause of how satisfied you are and then go tell all your friends. We'll be back anytime we're over here & I'll be spreading the word. Found a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been here before, considering its close proximity to my house!  After checking out the reviews on Yelp (and seeing they had a drive-thru), I made my over there, ordered a 2pc catfish and 3 shrimp meal, as well as a 10 piece order of BBQ wings.  Everything is made to order, so I had to wait at the window for a while for my order to be ready.  After a while, the cutest kid (based on other reviews, he must the owner's son) brought me my food, politely telling me that all my sauces were inside the bag.  The catfish was deliciously seasoned and cooked!  Moist and flavorful, just like it should be!  The shrimp were butterflied and breaded and served with a spicy cocktail sauce -- so good!  The BBQ wings were just as good!  I love this place, and I'll definitely be back!  My ONLY complaint is that the drive-thru wreaks of a trash smell, presumably because the dumpster at the back of the property (behind the drive-thru) was open.  So I just had to keep my window rolled up while I was waiting, and hold my breath while the window was open. LOL."}
{"text":"FOOD WAS OKAY, NOTHING SPECIAL, NOT WORTH THE PRICE IN MY OPINION. 

I tried this place cause my Husband insisted we try it. I wasn't impressed at all went once and never returned. This location is down the street from a fish n chips place I prefer, I would of expected this place to be bomb NOPE! We had a sandwich which didn't have much meat and full of grease and fish wasn't to my liking."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times before thinking it would be a good idea to stop in some day and see what they had. I finally stopped in and found out it was, indeed, a very good idea to do so.

While fish & chips is front and center of what they do, they also have sandwiches, burgers, chicken wings, shrimp, and more, mostly deep fried. But, I had to go for fish & chips. If that's what they're going to build their business around, it had better be good.

It is. I chose the cod (you can also have whiting, catfish, or tilapia). The fish isn't processed, it's cut from filets, and it's hand breaded then deep fried to crispy perfection.

Also had the clams and mushrooms, both deep fried, and both very good. Their fries are a bit limp, but that makes it easier to sop up the vinegar if you decide to go tradtional on your fish & chips.

Next time I'm driving by thinking it would be a good idea to stop in and get dinner, I'll be more likely to do exactly that."}
{"text":"Guilty pleasure. Don't let the neighborhood scare you away, this place is a dime. Marlyn's always has solid food. Blows the other fish and chips places out of the water, you get a choice of cod, catfish or tilapia (cod is the best!). Service is always friendly and O'Shea is a sweet guy, always remembers us by name. Their fries are delicious, their food is made to order so it takes a few minutes, but piping hot food is worth it!! They have their own version of Pete's sauce (ketchup and hot sauce) which is a little spicier but goes great with just about everything. I always make sure to get a side order of fried clams, but I've been told their fried oysters are awesome as well. They also have burgers, wings, sandwiches and gyros; something for everyone. Can't go wrong if you need to get a greasy fix."}
{"text":"Great tasting food with awesome people that make you feel welcome!  Thanks for an amazing experience, definitely will be back for our fish & chips fix"}
{"text":"I came here because of the rating, thinking that Yelp would generally steer me in the right direction.  This is one instance in which Yelp got it wrong, for me.  I do not understand how this place could have 4.5 stars!????

The primary reason I am giving this place a 2 star and not a one star is I hate to give mom and pop type establishments a 1-star review.  I understand the potential ramifications of negative Yelp reviews, thus, I want to be careful with my critique of this restaurant, while being honest about what I experienced.

 I sat close to the wall on the right side of the entrance and I could see in the kitchen fairly well. The reason I would never go back is that I saw a woman in the back eating food and then turning and preparing food to be served. That made me stop eating my food and instruct the young person with me to not eat the food that I know was probably handled by hand.  I observed a man walk in from off the street and then pick up my tray of food and then deliver it to me.  Not, so bad, since the food was in containers and on a tray, but he dropped off our food at the table and left.  He never washed his hands.  I also observed other people eating food back there and handling food.  This is how illnesses are spread.  

I ordered the WTF fries, I didn't eat much of this dish.  I also had 6 chicken wings and some sides.  The wings were ok.  The calamari and okra were ok too.  

Sadly, I would never go back here. I feel bamboozled by their cute pics online."}
