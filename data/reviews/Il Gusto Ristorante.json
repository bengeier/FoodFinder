{"text":"Great food! No... Amazing food!
Had an excellent meal and top notch service.
Got lucky with the lady friend after our night out there too!
The food MUST BE aphrodisiac...Hahaha!

All in all - GREAT value, service, quality and price!"}
{"text":"I've been there for dinner several times and have yet to be disappointed.  There's a nice patio which is great on summer evenings.  I've only sat inside once, but it has a very cozy atmosphere.  Anything I've ordered from the menu has always been excellent and friends I've gone with said the same about whatever they ordered.  Great pesto!
Service is very friendly and price is very affordable."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. 20 minute wait at Mitzy's, so we wandered east on College Street, and came upon Il Gusto, which was barely half full. First impressions: Super-friendly service. Terrible brewed coffee. On the great-service side, the waitress offered to make us Americanos instead of brewing a whole pot of coffee for our refills. Americanos were pretty good.

And the food?  Not so good. Omelette was overdone on the outside and completely dry on the inside. Deep-fried wedge potatoes are tasty (nothing like salt and fat)... but how about serving something more subtle and healthy?  Hollandaise sauce on the poached eggs was thin to the point of translucense and lemon-yellow.

All in all, friendly server aside, a very mediocre brunch, not worth leaving the house for."}
{"text":"I remember coming here a couple of years ago with a group and one of my friends knew the chef or something? So there was that feeling of \"we're going to get treated nicely\" and we were. Can't remember what I had to eat (likely some pasta) but it tasted decent and the place seemed nice.

Was there a few days ago and had a different experience. Sat on the patio by myself and there were maybe four other parties sharing the space with me. Inside there must have been one group of maybe 2-3 people. So the place was not busy... Didn't take long to get served or have my food order taken, but the amount of time to get a drink was a lot longer than it should have been given the slow night. When you decide to make a preemptive strike and order another drink when you are only half way through your current one then something's not right.

I ordered the salmon. It apparently came with a salad which arrived 20 minutes after I ordered it. I'm not a chef but I don't think it takes very long to make salads, does it? The salmon then came about 15 minutes later. The waitress apologised for the wait, which is nice to know they are aware, but the wait wasn't really worth it. The salmon had way too much salt on it. I felt my sodium levels rising with each bite. And it came with some very simple penne pasta in tomato sauce. I don't really think of pasta when it comes to salmon, but I guess I didn't read the menu properly.

Anyway, wasn't too thrilled with the food or service my second time around. If the food comes quickly and doesn't taste too hot then I can deal with that. If the food comes late and tastes amazing then I can deal with that as well. Late food that doesn't taste good is lame. Also, I finished two pints of beer in the time it took for my food to arrive. Not a good look."}
{"text":"I know I should be aware of bad service during Taste of Little Italy. But this is not an unexcpected event - so they have more than enough time to hire extras for this specific weekend and serve better. I don't want to hear people apologizing, I want to be decently served. 

#1 The food: I asked for a simple salad and they forgot to put some items on the salad, like parmesan cheese and nuts - my salad turned out to be greens and vinaigreette, basically, and I got no discount for it. I tried to grab a waitress to complain, but she was too too busy, so I gave up and had it anyway. 

#2 The drinks: I asked for some shots on their menu, they didn't have lots of things to make drinks. I started creating my own drinks based on what was left on their counter (basically Frangelico and vodka, as far as I remember.... I also had the last shot of Kahl√∫a)

I stood on their counter so long waiting for the change, with no sight of a waitress, some customers mistook ME for a waitress. This was really bizarre.

I might give them a chance in another situation."}
{"text":"Ahhh \"Il gusto\"... Paraphrasing in Spanish, will be \"el gusto... raro\".

That's to say, the place is definitely Italian'ish, but with an interesting twist. The way they treat you totally depends on being part of the community. If you are, they smile, If you are not, they fake a smile.

That bunch of local people around us were treated as if they were part of the family - their kids were hugged, their elderly got free glass of water, their king-size moms got compliments on their beauty... We were not blessed with such a respect, so were just sitting there in the corner, waiting for the orders to arrive, feeling like we were some miserable and unexpected nuisance.

It took those guys forever to bring us a relatively obvious menu choices. Food quality was decent, and portions were big. All cool, except for that feeling that we were not welcome at Il Gusto. And I didn't even rest my cowboy boots over the white tablecloth, or spat a chew on the floor! Oh man...

Overall, a-ok. I can possibly imagine dropping back in there, I have guts - but will not enjoy."}
{"text":"In this economy there are certain phrases that are music to my ears: Rainbow Cinemas, two for one, metropasses for post-secondary students and prix fixe. Il Gusto happens to incorporate one of those, though I wouldn't mind if it included the others.

I decided not to dick around and ordered the Prix Fixe special. House salad, a pasta dish and a lovely soda can circumference creme brulee. My group decided to order some goat cheese dip and bruschetta. The goat cheese dip was flavoured with jalapenos and served with tortilla chips which I would've been down with it it was a Mexican restaurant but alas, until someone proves the Italianity of tortilla chips I'll remain disappointed. The bruschetta was served in toonie-sized slices which is so not kosher because bruschetta was invented as a cheap way to get rid of kitchen produce leftovers and stale bread. All of my indifference towards the appetizers vanished when I lowered that first bite of pasta in to my mouth. So friggin' good. I got a dish with clams that was pretty damn awesome, the marinara sauce had a great kick and was a nice departure from my usual rose sauce. 

On to the creme-brulee-moment-of-truth. I had this stunning epiphany as I tried desperately not to shovel the entire petite serving in to my mouth. I need more creme brulee in my life. I knew it existed and that was enough. I felt like it was a pretty average desert, one that didn't get much love in my belly. All this has changed, I now covet creme brulee like I covet the perfect cream cheese icing."}
{"text":"The prices are terrific, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. The food is pretty good, but not worth the wait.

We got there at around 8pm. The place was busy, but not packed. It wasn't long before we noticed that Il Gusto only had one waitress and one chef working on a Friday night. They both seemed quite busy, and to be honest, this made me feel a bit apprehensive.

We sat down, looked at our menus, and waited for the waitress to pick our orders. When she finally got to our table, we ordered the Bruschetta as an appetizer, and the Gnocchi on Heaven's Door and the Veal Parmesan as our entrees.

It took about 20 minutes to get our appetizer. The Bruschetta was good, but nothing special. It seemed like a watered down version of the italian favorite. It was just toasted bread with mozzarella and diced tomatoes, nothing you can't make at home for half the price. There were no chopped onions, no hint of garlic or olive oil, and no basil. It felt very basic and bland.  If you like your bruschetta with all the works, skip it as an appetizer at Il Gusto.

We thought our food would be ready as soon as we finished our appetizer, but we were wrong. We had to wait for another 20-30 minutes to get our entrees. The Gnocchi on Heaven's Door was amazing. It melted right in your mouth, and the Gorgonzola sauce was probably the best I've had in Toronto. The Veal Parmesan could have been better. The meat was a little dry, and the whole plate was covered in tomato sauce.  You couldn't  take one bite that didn't taste like you had a spoonful of tomato sauce in your mouth.

It was another 15 minute wait to get our plates cleared, then another 10-15 minutes to get our bill. The waitress was very apologetic about the situation, but the damage had already been done. The whole night was ruined by having to wait way too long for everything."}
