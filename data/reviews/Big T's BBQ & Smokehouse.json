{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since I tasted their goods at the Taste of Calgary last summer. Maybe it was an off day or my expectations were too high but I thought my experience could've been better. I ordered the beef brisket and the dry rib tips. The beef brisket was tasty but I've had more tender and flavourful brisket before. I didn't care for the dry rib tips at all ... too much bone and fat and not enough meat, I thought. If I go back, I'll try something different. Warning: the spicy Chili is really spicy (I can eat hot stuff but even I found it to be very hot)."}
{"text":"Really good experience at Big T's overall. The hostess, backed by a completely full house, told us that it would likely be 45 minutes. We opted to risk the wait and were pleasantly surprised after being seated after only 14 minutes.  I opted to try the meatloaf after seeing that it was featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here!\". It didn't disappoint. It was flavourful, juicy, and delicious. The cornbread was pretty dry, but I don't expect much from cornbread.  For dessert, I tried the apple cobbler - the crumble was very dry and was more like just oats sprinkled on apples.   Our server was not attentive at all, leaving the host and a supervisor to bring us refills of our beverages. When we were paying the bill, she would actually look away from us, instead of attempting to engage in any conversation.  That being said, the other staff were extremely friendly! and the food, overall, was delicious. Make sure you check it out."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. Went for lunch, my nephew ordered deep fried pickles, couldn't eat them because the pickles were too tough. He ate one and sent them back. Our server had recommended the dish and when we sent them back the response from her was one of disbelief, \"these pickles were voted the best at the Calgary Stampede\". That may be true, but this batch was not edible.  I had a pulled pork sandwich, it was cold like it had been taken out of the refrigerator, fries were fairly warm and soggy. I told the server after we had eaten about our disappointment, but there was no real concern. I told her that I had eaten at Big T's in the past and asked if they had changed ownership or something, she said no. We were charged for the pickles, no apology and the sense that no one cared, I felt uncomfortable even giving my feedback.  That is the reason I will never be back and will not recommend this place to others. The bill came to nearly $50 with tip and no alcohol."}
{"text":"Must Have: deep fried pickles, hush puppies (available as an appy or as a side with your meal), brisket.  Avoid: cornbread.  It's cold.  It's feel like a rubber block.  It's not good at all.    This place has decent food but I think The Palamino, Jojo's BBQ truck, and even Tony Roma's serve up better bbq."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for years wondering if it was worth the stop. Having lived in Texas for 5years it was going to be hard pressed to meet my standards. However, all in all it didn't do too bad and I will be back to try it again.   I shared a $45 meat platter with a friend and it was pretty darn good besides the cornbread. The brisket was a bit dry but with a little splash of their sauce it was much better. The cornbread was extremely dry (days old) and should not have been served. The meat was well smoked and tender and I recommend the pulled pork and ribs. Prices were pretty steep but hey it's Calgary."}
{"text":"Big T's is a pretty decent formulaic facsimile of a southern BBQ joint.   They've got the wood tables and the blues posters on the walls to create the rustic casual vibe you'd find in the Deep South.   But that's about where the similarities end, unfortunately.   Sure, they offer all the right items - pork ribs, chicken, brisket, pork butt - but they just lack the succulence and that true smokiness of the real deal.  The food's not bad, just uninspired.   But when you love BBQ as much as I do, a decent approximation is better than no BBQ at all, and that's what you'll get if you pay a visit to Big T's."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. We got the deep fried pickles to start then the Elvis platter. 10/10 its all so delicious! Wear sweatpants and come hungry."}
{"text":"This place disturbed me. There were flies everywhere, landing on the massive piles of meat piled up in front of you. Everything tasted similar... and not a leafy green in sight. \"Good Value\", sure. But then again, you often get what you pay for in Calgary, unfortunately."}
{"text":"To be honest I would love to give this place 5 stars because the food was great and our server was lovely, but the woman who greeted us at the door and brought us to our table was sooooo rude. I would highly recommend they do something about this - the first person you talk to at a restaurant should be friendly at least. The meatloaf was amazing, cornbread so amazing and light I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went there for a business lunch on a Monday. My lunch partner had not arrived yet so the waitress seated me and then ignored me completely. Even though the place was pretty much empty. The service improved somewhat after that but I wouldn't give it high marks.   I like the ambiance - kind of old west with blues music playing in the background. I had a barbecue pork special. It was pork on a bun with coleslaw, beans and french fries on the side. The food was OK but nothing special. I think I may have been spoiled by my exposure to good Southern US barbecue - Big T does not measure up to that."}
{"text":"Awsum food Great service Wouldn't call it a \" family \" restaurant with a buncha hill Billy red necks dropping F bombs every 30 seconds with a family seated next to them with 4 children. Their hot sauce is epic"}
{"text":"I went to the new Deer Run location not once, but twice (Was with different groups) in the last week and coincidently had the same server, I believe Natalie?  I am a huge fan of the deep fried pickles, they are wonderful (both times) and worth going in just for those!  I really like the spicy coleslaw, and the dry ribs fell off the bone they were so tender and tasted even better.   Our server was very knowledgable about the menu and answered about a million of my friends questions...thanks for having such a great sense of humour. Drinks were kept topped up and food arrived hot and in a timely manner.   I love trying new places, but won't be back if the service wasn't at least as good as the food.....I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The only restaurant I have ever purposely not tipped. Dry, bland everything. Never take a visitor here with Alberta beef in mind. They will just have fuel for an Alberta joke."}
{"text":"I took my mother here for a late lunch / early supper and it looks like that will be the only time I choose to be a patron at Big T's.  We asked the waitress about a good appetizer and settled on the Deep fried dill pickles. This was my first experience with said dish , it was partly the recommendation and partly the curiosity. Not knowing what good fried pickles are like I can't say if they were good or bad I can say that I didn't like them and I am a fan of fried food and pickles.    I had a brisket and it was dry'; various sauces are provided to go on top but I found them all lacking in both viscosity and flavor. The bun that came with was stale as all hell.   I just don't think the quality justified the expense and can't see myself returning in the near future.  On the plus the server was nice and the food came out promptly and the restaurant was nice enough."}
{"text":"This place equates to my worst nightmare of a restaurant. I feel about it like I feel about most Mexican restaurants, everything is mass produced as the start of the day then reheated and slopped on your plate for a high price. You are crammed at a small table where there is not enough room for your plates and small children run around you screaming. The food isn't bad, but I wouldn't choose it over pub food I could get down the street- or a frozen pizza at home. Not for me at all."}
{"text":"The food was ok... nothing to write home about. I've definitely had better bbq, even here in Calgary. The food portions were very large, which translates to very good value for the money.  But the flavour of food itself was \"meh.\""}
{"text":"We have been going to Big T's for about 4 years now. The food is always great and they have very friendly staff. I think it would be a great location to have a party because of the huge platters... I believe they are big enough for 10 or more people. Located right across from Mcmahon Stadium it's convenient to grab a bite before or after the game. The lunch specials are around $8 and the portions are perfect"}
{"text":"The smell of Big T's BBQ is enough to make anyone salivate, if they came hungry or not. The food itself holds up to it's rich aroma. This place offers a full-range of traditional BBQ meats, from pulled pork to smoked chicken to their own catfish ??? sandwich. When I ordered the half-chicken, the server asked what type of homemade BBQ sauce I wanted  with it. I ordered Big T's original sauce, but she brought out all of the others in a basket with my meal, thereby rendering my selection meaningless. Which she couldn't account for. It was cool though because the Carolina mustard was definitely worth a try. The portions were large and the whole atmosphere worked well. It has a New Orleans blues theme with posters of old musicians hanging everywhere, wood tables and that smell makes you want to eat in a weird way. You half expect to look over and see a chubby bluesman sucking back ribs and cornbread -- which they serve with all their meals. Worth a try if you're hungry and looking for some southern smoked BBQ meats."}
{"text":"I've lived in Florida, Kentucky, Texas and Arizona.  This BBQ is pretty close to very good BBQ restaurants in those states and better than anything in North Carolina. In town for only a short visit and when this came up on Yelp had to give it a try. The place was packed with folks who looked like they've been there before and clearly like their BBQ. Kid friendly and the staff worked hard to keep us happy. Tip a little extra."}
{"text":"I'm from Toronto but the past 2 times I've come to Calgary I make sure to stop by.    Had the deep fried pickles today, creole shrimps and spicy coleslaw.  All super delicious.   Will be going back tomorrow for their brisket.  I love their brisket because it's so flavorful and tender but not drenched in sauce that takes away from the natural taste.  You can add your own sauce to it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Favourite place to eat! I love the Pulled Pork Sandwiches, the deep fried pickles are Great too!"}
{"text":"If you want hot, delicious, home-made food with excellent service, then you should check out Big T's!  I'm not a huge meat eater so I unfortunately cannot compare to actual southern BBQ.  However, the ribs, chicken, pulled pork and catfish po' boy that my family ordered were all very good!  And the beans - homemade baked beans.  Not an easy thing to pull off and they were yummy!  The portions were just right and the desserts were excellent!  Most importantly, service was fast and staff was attentive.  With 2 growing kids (especially my 12 year old son, who surprised everyone by ordering the largest meal), we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very average. You'll come away satisfied but not feeling like it's some of the best BBQ you've ever had and can't wait to return.  My ribs were dry, not served hot, and not very meaty.  Tasted like they were warmed over.  The corn bread was not fresh and it is not served with real butter. Onion rings were good. Not much really to recommend here.  Having said all that about the food, I should mention that the service was terrific."}
{"text":"Had the gutbuster. Good food, wonderful service. Would definitely recommend a visit if you consider yourself to be a carnivore."}
{"text":"Located in the strip mall across from McMahon Stadium and behind Motel Village, Big T's BBQ is good value for the money when your inner carnivore's been kept in its cage a bit too long.  AMBIENCE/SERVICE: Right when you walk in you're greeted by a waft of smoked meat and BBQ sauce. Servers were nothing out of the ordinary, attentive and friendly for the most part, but we felt a bit neglected at the end of our meal trying to get the bill and some more water. 1.5/2.5  FOOD: As all the other reviews have already said, the portions are quite large, expect to spend anywhere from $15-25 and get properly filled. Anything more imo you should be confident in your ability to finish a huge meal or be prepared to bring some home. I got the Gutbuster ($17.50), a gigantic sandwich with pulled pork, brisket, Andouille sausage, jalapeños, caramelized onions, and mozzarella cheese. I thought the meat was a bit on the dry side, but the overly heavy sauces supplied took care of that for the most part. This sandwich comes with a fork and knife, but to our server's surprise, I was somehow able to straddle the beast in my hands with minimal slippage. My larger friend struggled to finish his prime rib beef bone ($29), even contemplating life after the 3rd bone, but it excellent nonetheless. Stoners beware: the meals here are no walk in the park, do not underestimate the portions here. 1.5/2.5"}
{"text":"First time to this Calgary eatery. Ordered the ribs and meat combo. Chose the St. Louis ribs and brisket with baked beans and chilli on the side. The ribs were perfect, not so with the brisket. The brisket was chewy and firm. All bark too. As for sauces, the traditional was the standout. Bourbon sauce was bitter, hot was too hot and mustard did not impress. The beans were great and the chilli was tasty but overwhelmingly tomato flavoured. They use brisket meat in it.   The service was top notch and the Long Island iced teas were fantastic."}
{"text":"Second time around and will for surely be my last first time I went I had ribs and thought they were decent nothing special really .... Today I went and started with the Mac and cheese and it was pathetic to say it nicely .... Then had a lunch special which the brisket on the bun was good ill give em that but overall it is def the tv show that keeps this place a float"}
{"text":"The dusty rib ends are a super tasty way to start a great meat-fest... The ribs are great with lots of options in terms of the sides!  The new management group has done lots in terms of the excellent renovations to provide a nice wide-open clean appearance rather than the older setup that had multiple levels and lots of corners.  The staff are super friendly and helpful.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Haven't been back for a long time, not sure why because I always leave with a smile on my face.  Some renos were done since my last visit a bit more sleek and modern look.  It looks great but lots of hard surfaces so it was fairly loud.  The designer of the bar stools should be made to sit on them for 2 hrs, butcher blocks don't make good seats.  The meatloaf was awesome as usual but the brisket was overdone and slightly dry.  I had mashed and potato salad as sides but did not like the potato salad as there were more onions than potatoes.  And the onions overpowered every other taste, so I would not recommend the potato salad.  Worth the visit just for that delicious meatloaf."}
{"text":"Not worth going IMO. We did not enjoy our lunch at Big T's and won't be going back.  I had a pulled pork sandwich which needed more \"Carolina\" Style sauce, not the nasty \"house\" BBQ sauces they give you in the bucket. My fiance had the butt rub burger which was terrible and dry. We also ordered deep fried pickles and were very dissapointed with them too. Not even home-battered, just bought junk.  Don't bother with this lame BBQ."}
{"text":"I went here with a foodie from Texas. I actually flew out for a weekend just to get BBQ with him. Therefore, we were complete snobs at Big T's and I am going to share this snobbery with you.  BBQ places in Texas all have their own vibe and style. No two places are the same, and they are definitely not like a Chili's. Lots of them are cafeterias that have spunk, there are dozens of microbrews in ice buckets just waiting to be consumed, augh, dining at one of these places is an EXPERIENCE. Walk up, order, get your number, wait up to 10 mins, help yourself to chips, wait in anticipation, and gloriousness awaits. Better yet, grab a tray, order your food and sides cafeteria style, and sit on a bench in the 90f heat at 9pm. Big T's, however, is just like any other banal, boring, uninspired experience in Calgary. Walk in. Wait for one person to tell you where to sit. Sit in restaurant with contrived interior style. Wait for another person to come. Order. Wait 15-20 mins for mediocrity.  We were fine with this crap until my friend asked the server for a the moist cut of the brisket. In Texas, the response is always along the lines of \"certahinly, bayebeedahl!!\". In Calgary, it tends to be long the line of: \"we cannot do that.\" We scoff, she continues: \"we pre-cut the brisket, mix it, and put it in bags\". Yes. She said that. Almost proudly. We didn't have to ask her to tell us that they only smoke once a week instead of nightly.  Knowing BBQ, the food was average to below average. If you never had BBQ, you will probably think it is pretty good. It falls really short from what real BBQ should be. Calgary has incredible access to good beef and pork and there is no excuse for it being this half assed. Pre-cut and put in bags. Wow."}
{"text":"How can you not love a place where the staff wear shirts that say \"I like my butt rubbed?\" lol (I am assuming that they're referring to the meat, but I don't know what people may be into. . . I'M NOT JUDGING ANYONE!)  My work has had Big T catered lunches before and they've always been meh. I honestly think it's harder to keep a huge amount of food at the right temperature so their food isn't represented to it's full potential.  Having a craving for ribs, a group of us decided to try Big T's. The fact that none of us had been here was a bit of a surprise, but awesome that we'd all be able to try something new together!  I'm forewarning you that I didn't get any healthy veggies whatsoever, so my meal was very monochromed - ribs with mashed potatoes, corn bread and onion rings. But was very robust with flavor! And the housemade BBQ sauces that they brought out to the table complimented the food really well. My fave would have to be the Carolina Mustard.  I'm glad I gave this place a try, it'll definitely go on my list of BBQ places to hit up should I ever have another craving for ribs!"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait on a saturday night. Service was excellent, ( thanks Chris). Hush puppies were devine. Go hungry servings are large."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant two times. I don't know what the big fuss is.  The food doesn't taste fresh off the grill. The edges are burnt black. I know BBQ is supposted to be dark on the edge and taste great. NOT BURNT AND DRY.  Service is great and the atmosphere reminds me of the restaurants when I lived in San Antonio Texas.  I do enjoy the sausage that they have, and the pulled pork is also good. Stay away from the ribs as they are the burnt food I was earlier talking about.  You get to put your own sauce on what you want. They had 4 different choices at the table."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a friend on Saturday evening at Big T's BBQ & Smokehouse at the Crowchild Trail restaurant location.  We arrived without reservation and the place was busy but the server found us a spot.  I ordered the half rack meat combo for a cost of $28.  The next decision was to determine the rank choice, meat and side dishes.  I decided on the Big T's Memphis Baby Backs sauce-less ribs which were good, along with the Sliced Brisket which was fabulous!  The sides were mixed vegetables; broccoli and carrots which were good, and the smashed potatoes with gravy, mmmm gravy, and as Tony the Tiger would say, they're grrreat!  I would most certainly return for another helping of BBQ!"}
{"text":"Tried out the new location in Deer Run today. I was really excited to try this place again after having a good experience at the old Heritage location. Unfortunately, my friend and I were really disappointed.  We had the deep fried pickles, which were delicious (and the reason for the 2nd star) but came at the same time as my friends main. They had forgot/had ticket issues and my main was missed. A while later, my pulled pork sandwich finally came. The bun tasted stale and overall it was really bland, even with the addition of their sauces. I expected a lot more from a restaurant that specializes in BBQ. My friend had the Mac and cheese, which was dry and had very little cheese. She was also disappointed.   Overall, prices were higher than the food quality and I wasn't impressed that my order was misplaced. Usually management will offer a discount or some type of comp for this, but that did not happen. We well not be going back."}
{"text":"We had a delicious lunch here today and will definitely come back. I had an excellent brisket filled bun, paired with potato salad and cornbread. My companion enjoyed a bowl of brisket chilli, topped with cheese and served with tortilla chips. It was very tasty, a nice tomato based sauce, but quite mild.  In both dishes the brisket was incredibly tender, juicy and soft. Quite flavourful and not too much salt on the crust ( which could have been a tad crustier). The meat was enhanced by a very good house sauce.  The warm corn bread was correctly crumbly but it didn't fall apart. My only disappointment was the potato salad which needed a more piquant dressing.  Service was friendly and quick and the decor was modern and comfortable.  I don't know why we waited so long to visit."}
{"text":"I have been about 5 times over the last 6 weeks as I have been in town for work. It seems like the taste of the food has declined since my first visit. I now firmly believe the food relies on the sauce, which is delicious. The meat has been drier each visit and the cornbread has not once tasted fresh. A good indicator would be to pay attention to how many corn breads are being sent back uneaten to the kitchen. I saw several go back untouched. Although the the location to my hotel is convenient, after my visit tonight I'm not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times since it opened. At first, it was great. Like so many restraunts that \"make it\", they seem to have gone on auto pilot, no longer trying, but just coasting.  Over the last  couple of years it's been hit and miss--mostly miss.   Last night my ribs were dry and cold in places. Hush puppies were good, cornbread w bit stale I thought.  This was my last time! No more chances."}
{"text":"Anybody who gives this place less than 5 stars is insane. This is the best bbq I've had in Alberta and let me tell you I love meat more than a pornstar on paydays. Giant platters, great service, free parking and really friendly. If you're hungry I'd get the Elvis Platter. If you're not hungry I'd go with the Elvis platter and take some home.  So get your bbq on at BIG T's."}
{"text":"I've been to Big T's a couple of times now, and found it to be just so so. My last visit the meat that I had was overcooked, hard to chew and hard to swallow. The service was okay, just have to say for the price I'd rather spend it somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here with old Freind last night. She had brisket sandwich and I had brisket melt.    Don't think I got the brisket melt name right.   It was brisket onions peppers and cheese on a roll.  Very good. Amber liked her sandwich a lot too.   And it smells so good in there.    It was very busy so the room was a bit too chaotic and loud to enjoy it the best. And they give you bottles of sauce to add. These are also good.  But they were not labeled.   And even though I asked which was which, I quickly forgot.  So I don't know which one I liked"}
{"text":"Went here with the fam. 10 was overjoyed with his kid's burger and hush puppies. Hubby and I both got ribs. He with regular sauce, and mashed taters and gravy. I had honey bourbon with dirty rice. Hubby loved all of his food.  My ribs, slaw, corn bread, and beans were amazing. The dirty rice was so spicy it nearly blew my head off. If you're into that sort of thing, awesome, but for me, pain is not a flavour.   We had a lovely young man as a server. He was attentive without being a nuisance, and the food arrived quickly. The ambiance was pretty perky, but it was right after a Stamps game. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"First looks at the area around 'motel village' in Calgary led me to believe that the food basically got better the further away you got. On a lazy evening mid-trip, I'm glad I didn't call an Uber to run away, but instead walked over to Big T's. The bartender was lovely, the beer was cold, and the food hit the spot. It's not Jack Daniel's Invitational level BBQ, but it was definitely better than you would expect from such an unassuming strip mall joint.  I don't think any trip to Canada is complete without Poutine, so I was pleased to discover that not only could I get Poutine here, I could get it with pulled pork on top and have a delicious local dark Saison to wash it down. For the Poutine, the fries were crispy and well salted, the gravy was smooth and savory, the curds were melty and didn't overwhelm the pork, and the pork itself was moist and flavorful. I would've liked some more smoke character on the pork, and personally I love when I get a bit of dry bark on smoked meat, which unfortunately did not happen. As for the sauces, the mustard was tangy and played off the pork deliciously, but I definitely liked the hot best.  I was in the mood to hang out at a bar, mindlessly watch some sports, and enjoy a tasty bite. Big T's took care of all of that. If you're on this side of the city, you should definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Came here just for a beer and some snacks with my foodie friend. We ordered some hush puppies and rib ends. Both were tasty but I don't think i would order them again.   Service was good and portions were big. I would come back to actually try a meal."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a BBQ restaurant since the last time I was in Hawaii, and this place didn't disappoint. Corn fritters, cornbread, brisket, ribs, pulled pork...smokin' hot BBQ sauce...I was really pleased with the selection. Oh, and don't forget the deep fried pickles!  We ordered some appies (fritters, pickles, onion rings, wings) and one of the meat-eriffic platters, knowing full well we'd have lots of leftovers (three boxes full!). I'd say we left with full tummies and having sampled a great variety of their food.   My only hold-out for the last star is that I really was hoping to see some awesome collard greens on the menu!"}
{"text":"Southern style family restaurant. Lots of ppl, Hand rubbed ribs. 4 of us ordered baby racks, big t's special, meat loaf. Pork and chicken combo. Fast serving. Nice !"}
{"text":"We went to the location on crowfoot. And from the moment we walked in had a terrible feeling as there were several people waiting to be helped. Finally when the hostess came around she didn't even bother looking at the patrons who've been waiting for over 15 minutes just to ask how long the wait time was. And to top it off she had a sour look on her face while ignoring customers. I'll never go back. This doesn't even deserve 1 star"}
{"text":"The deep fried dill pickles will change your life! More likely your life span but totally worth it."}
{"text":"\"Genuine Southern\" BBQ\" in Calgary?  Its April 19 and its snowing!  Like Al Gore, they misjudged global warming I guess.  This is pretty good bbq.  Brisket is very tender with nice smoke flavor (with Canadian Alder, nice touch).  Lots of rib choices, but I did not try.  Andouille sausage was fine.  Onion rings crispy and not too greasy.  EXCELLENT mustard BBQ sauce.  Cord bread moist, but slightly sweet,  Beans and slaw are nothing special.  This BBQ place could survive Northwest of Kentucky in most US states."}
{"text":"Exactly as advertised. Southern style BBQ and Smokehouse food at extremely reasonable prices, staff was friendly.  I shared the deep fried pickles with the person I was with, and they had the chilli for their main course while I had one of their burgers -- both dishes were very enjoyable.  Cheesecake and chocolate cake for dessert.   Ultimately, the good quality food and reasonable prices are what pushes this to 4 stars -- a shared app, 2 meals and 2 desserts and soft drinks was only around $60."}
{"text":"BBQ is an art, like any form of cooking and to be good at it requires a lot of passion that can make you look like an obsessed freak or misunderstood artisan. Many people I meet that fit this description (mostly chefs) are single or divorced. A few I've met actually sleep in their kitchens so that they can check on the dough for the baguettes or tend to the smoker. I've seen a lot of that in my years in a kitchen, and though I have never really gone that far, I can say that I'm a little obsessed when it comes to cooking.  Big T's is a place that I've always driven past, but never eaten at. Since they took over the space years ago from a Spanish paella resto, they have been churning out BBQ ever since. The stadium location, I imagine doesn't hurt as well, considering that most football fans love meat an whatever form it may come in. Let me tell you about my first visit.  The first thing that will hit you as you walk into the casual space is the aroma of smoke. It's a welcoming aroma that usually signals that something good is going on here. The decor is the usual BBQ joint decoration, with the signs, chalkboard specials and other Deep South bric-a-brac you usually associate with this kind of thing. Not overly packed at lunch, but there were quite a few tables full of regulars to keep the service staff busy.  Big T's doesn't specialize in any certain style of BBQ, like many of the US meccas like Kansas City, Texas or Carolina. They smoke meat, using Okanagan applewood that results in a unique and flavourful assortment of whatever you fancy. On this day, I opted for a 2 meat (on a bun) combo with beef brisket, andouille sausage with a side of dirty rice and their house slaw.  The sides were done well, showing an attention to detail. The rice was a mix of long grain and wild, giving a nice textural contrast and visual appeal. It's cooked with green and red bell pepper and diced andouille sausage with a nice blend of spices. I can honestly say that I'd be good with a big bowl of that rice. Being Asian, I can say that the amount of meat just in the rice would be enough to carry it as a meal in itself. Great job.  The slaw was also done very well, preserving its crispness and just enough acidic bite in the dressing.  The Andouille sausage is different from the varieties available in the South, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. The fat distribution and texture of the filling is much more even, which results in a juicy and plump end product. I would've liked it with a little more spice, but that's what hot sauce is for.  Speaking of sauce, Big T's has 4 types of signature sauces that are made in-house (Original, Maple Bourbon, Smoking Hot and Carolina Mustard). All are tasty, depending on whatever meat you are enjoying.  Brisket was nothing to write home about. It's served sliced and when you're gonna serve smoked brisket sliced, you have to do it to order. This order was uniform brown throughout and sadly showed no evidence of that signature smoke ring that you should see in good smoked brisket. Was this brisket smoked offsite and brought in? Flavour was fair, but of course the resulting texture was not very juicy.  With a vast selection of meat, appetizers and sides to choose from, Big T's won't disappoint the picky. In fact, if you're in for a meat feast, there's the infamous Elvis platter - a $95 platter of almost everything that walks, with a selection of sides and buns.  All in all, I think that pricing is fair, the food is good and that Big T's does a good job in reminding us that it's nice to be on the top of the food chain."}
{"text":"I only had the pulled pork with spicy coleslaw salad and I must say they were both very decent.  This is definitely 'fast food', but considering they offer whole cuts of meat, can't be too unhealthy ;)"}
{"text":"I dined here on a  Friday night and noticed quickly that they had gone through some distinct changes. To be fair it had been a couple years since I was here last and it was probably needed. The food was fantastic and the service was great, I was disappointed that they got rid of their butt-rub lager though."}
{"text":"This was one of my usual places to grab good BBQ before I left Calgary.  I recently returned and I'm finding things aren't what they used to be.  This place has definitely gone WAY downhill.    I ordered a standard brisket sandwich.  This should be a walk in the park for ANY reputable BBQ joint and something they used to excel at in the past.   What I got was a joke.  A bun with a sliver of brisket on it, maybe 3 ounces worth of meat.  You could tell just by looking at it, that it was a terrible cut, nothing but tendons and grizzle.  I took one bite and found out that it was also ice cold.  It was so cold that I thought maybe they had run out of cooked brisket and served me something from the fridge.  Not only that but it was completely tasteless.  I'm not the kind of person to send something back unless it's REALLY bad.   This got sent back.  Along with the next one which was even more of an embarrassment.  Finally, I just sucked it up and ate a cold sandwich, which I informed the manager looming over my table after having sent back two plates.  To my surprise he made sure to point out that I would be paying for my meal.  As if I had planned to go in there without paying?  I hadn't even hinted about compensation.  What an insult.     I'll never be back.     Since returning to Calgary I've noticed this trend across many formerly fantastic places where people are willing to pay significantly more, for significantly smaller portions, terrible quality and questionable service."}
{"text":"A nice find near our hotel. Imagine this North Carolinian finding a barbecue restaurant in Calgary with South Carolina mustard based barbecue sauce! I enjoyed the brisket (we are out West) and my son had the Butt Rubbed Burger. We both left satisfied."}
{"text":"Very expensive here for what you get on your plate. If you have been to Texas before and have had REAL BBQ, this place pales in comparison but we were in the area and I had heard U Gotta Eat here had just done a taping at this restaurant. So it has to be good, right?  Walked in a little after 5pm and there were only 2 other occupied tables. Got a booth at the top which is a really cute little area past the open kitchen. This place was clean and I liked the casual atmosphere and the lovely aromas coming from the cooking area. I like open kitchen style. Service - lackluster. They lose a point here. The waitress would barely answer your question and flit off to wherever. It's not like she was busy. We were counting on the food to be a hit. Not so impressed. :( I ordered a rack of ribs so I could bring half home and I was really excited about the sides including the corn bread. The corn bread is said to be made daily. Not sure about that - it was underwhelming and cold. Would it be too much for them to warm it up a bit if they boast that they take the time to make it fresh? The rack of ribs was the smallest I had ever seen. Seriously, half of what you would get at Tony Romas, just to compare. I forget to mention to the waitress that I wanted baby back ribs and I got the defaulted St Louis Style (I was not asked either which I wanted). Fattier and NOT fall of the bone tender. I just wanted to cry! The bourbon maple sauce it came with was good but I had to ask for extra and the ribs do not come all nice and gooey and saucy.  Also on the plate was a tiny potion of beans and coleslaw. Both not bad. The beans had a hint of spice to them which I liked and the coleslaw was decent.  My chosen side was the mashed potatoes. I asked the waitress if the potatoes were real mashed or packaged prior to ordering and she stated that they were real, homemade with some added fluff filler. WTF? What does that mean? OK, I will bite, I got them. NOT real potatoes, I do not care what anyone said and they were not fooling me by dumping the oversalted gravy on top of them! Ladies and Gentlemen, while this may sound like a heap of food, it was so not, it was ridiculous! My husband got the 2 meat option which included a very small portion of brisket and a tiny smoked chicken breast. He was done eating in about 10 minutes or less. Sad. His ordered side was the burgoo soup - spicy, flavourful and warm.  The woman seated next to me long after we had finished eating had the baby back ribs and I could overhear her saying that they were fall off the bone tender. I could not help that I felt that I had got ripped off. The waitress knew it was our first experience there, why would she not have made it the best meal possible for the same price to us? Why, to save the restaurant a few bucks on the crappier ribs? $70 for a below average meal for 2 people. Plus tip which we cringed to give her. We could have gone for Pho 4 times for that amount of cash. Live and learn, not likely to return."}
{"text":"MMMM BBQ! Came here with a whack of us to celebrate a day in April. They were able to accommodate a large group which was nice and it was relatively quick.   Again being celiac, I have to be careful of sauces, and they did have one that was GF, and so was the corn bread. Had a delish order of ribs and coleslaw. It's a southern BBQ place and that is what you get!   Plenty of options and good flavor. And reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Fall off the bone baby back ribs, the best mashed potatoes and gravy I've ever had and that's great advice because I'm pretty picky! We had an awesome time with our friends Tom and Doreen while visiting Calgary! Pricing is a bit steep... Plates are large enough to share! We also had the apple crisp which was good except it was halfway cold."}
{"text":"I'd be lying if I said that Big T's appearance on You Gotta Eat Here wasn't the driving force behind our visit to the restaurant a few months ago. My fella also loves him some BBQ, so I surprised him one day by taking him here.  Our server was delightful, though the food was slow coming out. There was only us and one other family in the place, so we didn't anticipate waiting so long. Good things do come to those who wait! But by the time the food came out, we had polished off a pitcher, and were kind of beer-full. I know, I know, we're grown ups, I swear.  We started off with the fried pickles. My theory about fried pickles is that they all taste the same. They really do. No matter where you go, if they're serving fried pickles, they will take like the next place's fried pickles. I am waiting for someone to prove me wrong.  My fella had the ribs with slaw and hush puppies (aka dinner donuts), and I had a chicken burger. We were so stuffed by the end! The fella loved his ribs. My chicken burger was good too. I was especially pleased at all the sauce options. I do love a good sauce.  The thing is, the food was kind of expensive for what it was. No deep fried pickle is worth $11, folks.  This place is worth a try, and we'll probably go back one day. It wouldn't be the first place I would recommend, but I would not warn anyone away."}
{"text":"Good food, good service the taste is incomparable to any other bbq place I've ever had !"}
{"text":"Here's the rundown. This place, conveniently right across from McMahon Stadium, is just ok with me. The decor is definitely inspired by classic southern bbq's. There are old blues posters on the wall along with alot of pine. This can make for a great environment, especially if you are aiming for good bbq. The food, on the other hand, tastes like they don't care much (or assume there aren't enough people in Calgary that don't care or know about BBQ). The house BBQ sauce is ok....you might find yourself using it more than often considering how some of the meat is quite dry."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of BBQ and smoke. This place has done it from the ribs to brisket bang on. Been to BBQ pits from all accross this continent and this place  is definitely top five material. Number 1 north of Kansas City. Brisket, slaw and Deep fried pickles are the things paradise is made from. Would give 6 stars if they let me"}
{"text":"Great food, check! Great portions, check! Great price, check!  After previously trying and enjoying some of Big T's dishes at the market, I wanted to sample the rest of the menu. With four people looking for a fun take out meal, we opted for Big T's \"Big T Platter\".   I knew the platter was going to be big, described as including brisket, pulled pork, ribs, half chicken, rib ends, sausage, coleslaw, beans, fries, gravy, cornbread and buns. I was not prepared, however, for the giant container plus bag of sides and sauces that was handed to me upon entering.   Given the $74 price tag, I was expecting enough food for four people. The platter could easily feed closer to 5-6 people with average appetites.   Highlights included the fall-apart-tender brisket, savory gravy (don't turn down the offer for sauces!), and spicy coleslaw."}
{"text":"The food definitely varies from visit to visit, when it's good it's delicious, when its not you regret going since it's kinda expensive. I've been to Big Ts quite a bit for the past few years and would love to share some of my experiences with everyone.   I usually get the meatloaf and brisket, well seasoned and delish, or the dry rib ends, which are juicy and have an excellent spice. I usually stick to the two mentioned above, but have tried others in the past; the catfish was very meh the time I had it, not much flavor. Chicken breast was dry and bland. I used to get the pulled pork but it was dry once so I switched to brisket.   Fries are the large thick cut variety, I usually get those they are pretty good. I had the mashed potato once and it was kinda water, don't recommend. Chili was good, but quite spicy.   Every meal comes with beans, coleslaw and a piece of cornbread which is really awesome, they are usually pretty good. They always bring 3 sauces to the table for you, and if you order takeout they give you tiny dishes of the stuff too! However they seem to give a lot less food when you order take out.   So after all that, I would recommend you give Big Ts a try, the barbequed meats are quite delicious and I get a craving for it now and then. One of these days we might try the giant Elvis platter ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent meal last night! My son declared the Mac and cheese the best he's ever had. Service was so quick and our waitress was super friendly! I had one meat and two sides. It was so much food! Brisket was so tender and tasty. You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry then come here! Good selection of meats and ribs and chicken,(only saw one fish item on Menu) Food is distinctly smoked and very good if you like that kind of taste. Servings are huge so I recommend the half portions when you order, unless you are a bigger pig than me! Good blues plays in the background, Waitresses are cute and helpful. Decor is \"Southernly\" All in all, good night out if you are looking for a \"Rib nite\"!"}
{"text":"I have heard a few people talk about this restaurant over the years, it was always some place we were going to try.  We tried it and we won't be going back.  The shrimp creole appetizer was good.  Te dinners include cornbread, which was so dry and stale.  The beans were undercooked, my chicken breast was dry, the ribs were dry as well.  Tony Roma's has our business.  A huge disappointment.  The restaurant was busy, service was good, will not be going back."}
{"text":"Huge portions and authentic southern style taste. We went for lunch and I ordered the beef ribs which came with corn bread and some other delicious sides. The meal was so filling that I couldn't eat dinner that night and nor could the person I went with.   It is a little expensive though, but well worth it."}
{"text":"I don't know why Big T's is rated so poorly on here, I think it's a delicious place.  Southern Food is a delicious style of food that should be available everywhere. Big T's isn't really near where I usually am in Calgary but I make an effort to pop over there every now and then to satisfy my meat fix. All of the food they server there is delicious, from the ribs to the brisket to the beans to the corn bread. I have absolutely no complaints. I also recommend grabbing a Big T to drink as real iced tea is delicious. The server was nice although I never experienced any of the gimmicks described here in other reviews.  I recommend checking this place out, even if these other people don't like it that just means it's easier for me to get a seat!"}
{"text":"From the moment you step in you are welcomed with the sweets aroma of cedar wood and very clean, mid century modern decor. We got the Big T share meal and it was packed full of delicious meats.   The service was great and so was the atmosphere. I will be back to try our the brunch menu next time."}
{"text":"My new \"go to\" place in Calgary. The cornbread, deep fried pickles, the ribs ... oh my sweet heavens, the ribs !!! Oh, before I get too carried away, the gawd damned chilli-dog could quite possibly alter your view of the universe and bring about world peace... for real!!! The staff here are fantastic and I'm not sure, but it wouldn't surprise me if they flew in some little old lady that everyone calls Mema to make the cornbread..."}
{"text":"We visited Big T's with friends last summer, and were wowed by the food and smokey meat goodness. We vowed to bring my husband's parents the next time we came and order the Big T's platter so we could try everything. We arrived to an empty restaurant...we thought they were not open. After seating ourselves and ordering, the Big T's platter came out, along with our side of hush puppies. We were surprised to see a large mound of fries with not a lot of meat on the platter. The ribs that were supposed to be included on the platter came out about 10 minutes later, very carefully portioned to be 4 little skinny ribs for 4 people. The brisket and pulled pork portions were hardly enough for 4 people to try a bite, and the brisket was all fat with no beef. The sausage was burnt to the point of being crunchy, with little flavor left besides char. The meat portions were all on the small side. If you are looking at their website, ignore the photo of the platter--ours was half a platter of fries then a half of the remainder were the sides of beans & slaw etc. We were really disappointed...if we had not been there before and had such a good meal previously, we would not have been back. Not sure if they have changed a chef or they are resting on their \"You Gotta Eat Here\" endorsement (which there was a large sign in front of the restaurant referring to) but we rather doubt we will be back, as I do a better kick-ass smoked barbeque than what they are doing now."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Man these Calgarians must be spoiled to not give this place 5 stars! Faux BBQ ma azz.  I saw this place on \"ya gotta eat here tv show\" (google it) so i wanted to check it out. I have tried a lot of BBQ places and even made a few good ribs myself, and bones down this is the best beef ribs I have EVER had. The smoky goodness never stopped coming and the succulent tenderness is there right down to the bone. Their maple bourbon sauce and rubs were bang on. Yes the service is a bit slow and the girls run ragged, but the place is busy. Also the fries were awesome as was the coleslaw. I didn't care for the corn bread, but I don't no matter were I go. The beans were really good to.  Compared to this place Montana's beef ribs are a single star.   Ya gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"This place is always crowded and has great food! We go there for brisket and ribs. The portions are huge and the drinks are great! What's funny is the joy on people's faces when they get their food, it's priceless"}
{"text":"I simply cannot compare this place to the BBQ places I have eaten at in Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas and Kansas in terms of value or taste. None of those places had their baked beans taste like they are right out of the can. If you are going to serve corn bread at least use a decent recipe so it is not so dry and cold that you could use it for a hockey puck. Their meat portions are very small and they need extra sauce added from the table to give it some flavor and moisture."}
{"text":"They've renovated since I've first visited. It suits the BBQ smokehouse theme. It's a smaller restaurant but not too loud or congested. There was a decent line up and we were told the wait would be 45 minutes, but it ended up being only a 10 minute wait. The service was quick and the food came fast, which kept the line moving faster than they said.   The prices are reasonable. A platter for $43 will feed two people. It's definitely a place for the meatatarian. You get an assortment of brisket, chicken, pulled pork and ribs, with a side of coleslaw and beans.   So that said it's a decent place for the amount and quality of food. It's nothing that stands out anymore than a Montana's restaurant though. It was featured on the show You Gotta Eat Here, and they made sure to advertise that in their menu. They also offer a bucket with a trio of sauces to add to your dish, which is nice if you want to mix flavours but they are chilled so it throws off having a hot dish of BBQ'd meat.   The server was great, very friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Great food, but service was okay.  I was hungry and the menu described the meatloaf as a heaping serving of meatloaf with cornbread and two sides. Having never been before, I heard the food was worth visiting. I was disappointed by the serving size and the sides looked like they had been re-heated from the day before. The meatloaf was good, but I had hoped for a larger portion. They should rename the place \"Little t's. Big T's on a Diet.\""}
{"text":"Good food for a reasonable price. Louisiana jazz in the background. If you like meat you need to check it out. I ate for two days in the leftovers of an 18.00 ten meal. Good fresh cornbread! Drinks are a reasonable price too!"}
{"text":"The food here is good but the wait time is way too long and definitely not worth the wait. I came here on Thursday at 345pm, ordered food for takeout and it took 45 minutes from the time I paid for the food to come to me. I've come other times and sat in and waited around 30 minutes on average. If you come here make sure you aren't starving because you'll be waiting a long time for your food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had drove in from edmonton and he had seen their resturant on the show you gotta eat here. so we located the wonderful establishment in calgary and what luck we had too ! The Grand Re - opening !!!! Perfect evening !!! The deep fried dill pickles were too die for, the most perfect consistency of batter !! They did not Soggy up :D they had my favourite beer waspberry wild rose beer on tap !!! My boyfriend had the gutbuster and i had the meatloaf  :D i have not lived until this moment !!! Chili fries and cornbread !!!  The service was so down to earth and friendly, the owner makes regular rounds asking everyone how their meal is and help his staff too !!! Completely won us over !!!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I know nothing about BBQ... I was a vegetarian until a few years ago. Now that I've discovered meat it's all I ever want... so I nabbed a coupon for this place off deal find. It's looks kinda ghetto from the outside..and inside lol.  I started enjoying myself when I ordered iced tea and it was real iced tea, not nestea. Deep fried pickle appey was good,  but hard to finish even between two people. My hubby and I both had brisket on a bun. The worst part about this meal was the cornbread...my mom makes it and it's delicious but here it was cold and oddly rubbery. My brisket was great... Yum yum. Cole slaw was edible, which makes it the best restaurant slaw of my life (many bad experiences). We would have had a better time if our server made eye contact or smiled or something, but she was limping so who knows maybe she sprained her ankle and the boss won't give her a day off. In that case id be pissy too. But our food came out lightning fast and our drinks were never empty. Id go back for more!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here with some friends on a snowy December Sunday. We came when they open and were the only table. Since I was meeting up with the gf for food in an hour or two, I decided to get the smallest brunch item which ended up being amazing.   The breakfast sandwich with brisket for $6 is unbeatable. My friends ordered the southern eggs benny for $14 and basically got the same amount of food as I did. The brisket was tender and tasty with the supplied bbq sauce on the side. The egg was runny and the coleslaw/hash browns on the side were solid.  I ended up with a full belly and found probably one of the most amazing value brunch item in Calgary."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves Big T's. And he loves chicken & waffles. When I found out Big T's was now serving brunch I knew I had to surprise him.  After mulling over my choices, (smoked meat and cornbread eggs bennies, shrimp & grits, breakfast sammies and more) I decided to also order the chicken & waffles. The chicken & waffles were described on the menu as, \"Buttermilk waffle with 3 pieces of smoked and then deep fried chicken.\" Sign me up.  The restaurant was quiet, however, our food did take quite a while to be served. I wish I would have remembered to take a picture of the plate when it arrived (not just the attached leftovers picture). There was literally more than half a chicken on top of a golden waffle that seemed almost half a foot high. I was not expecting the giant portion size for $15.  The first bite of chicken was amazing. The crust on the chicken was so incredibly crunchy (it was cornmeal based) and the herbs were strong and flavorful. The smokiness of the chicken underneath made the chicken sing. I cannot stress enough how awesome this chicken is.  The waffle was fluffy and seemed to have a beautiful vanilla flavoring to it.   After half a waffle and one giant piece of chicken, I was too full to continue. I was sad that I had to quit because eating this chicken while it was hot out of the fryer was  addicting. I'm sure it will be delicious as leftovers which I can't wait to enjoy.  I cannot recommend enough trying out Big T's brunch as soon as you can. I'm sure this will become a brunch spot favorite for anyone that ventures in."}
{"text":"I guess you would figure I would go after some Barbeque while in Calgary.  This place just happened to be near my hotel, so I walked over there.   They had a few different selection of meat.  I went with the St Louis Pork Ribs, which came with cornbread, hush puppies, baked beans and coleslaw.  I wouldn't expect to find great ribs in Canada, but these weren't that bad.  The St Louis Style had a decent dry rub on it with some sauce.  The sauce wasn't that great, but the dry rub and pork were fairly decent.  The meat didn't have a lot of smoke flavor and I was disappointed to see the chefs using the microwave.  As for all the sides, I thought they were all below average. http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/fSFbPfq35Kn5SOIc87OXSA?select=cfmL-ppbVNeGdCf6i2-hOw http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/fSFbPfq35Kn5SOIc87OXSA?select=04vU6QXltiq2sMekDuYcsA  All in all this place wasn't bad, but I would only come here for a sandwich.  But Canada isn't known for barbeque.  I would give this 2 stars if it were in the USA, but since its Canada I will give it 3."}
{"text":"I had no idea what I was getting myself into when my frisbee team suggested heading to Big T's after our last fall league game of the year (which just so happened to be Halloween night and I was dressed as Wendy from Wendy's... see the photos on my profile).  Big T's is kinda like cheez whiz. It adds some personality to your meal. Servers included. Our server had a nickname for everyone at our table as she took our orders. There were easily 15 of us there. Other personality adders - menu items like the Butt Rub Burger (guess what I ordered?).   Although I enjoyed my Butt Rub (ideal after any strenuous exercise), I was a little jealous of the folks in our party who ordered the two meat meal.  Yep, your choice of any two meats (sliced brisket, pulled pork, smoked chicken breast, meatloaf, Andouille sausage, catfish and dusty rib ends). The chili was something to shake your fist at too... no bull.  Remember to also try the hush puppies. I'm not going to tell you what they are, but they sure are tasty."}
{"text":"Didn't know they had lunch specials until I happen to drop by today. Awesome value, same delicious bbq. Also got a poutine to go cause I couldn't get enough. Best bbq in calgary!"}
{"text":"Where to begin! First off service is incomparable. All the servers were so friendly and happy to get you anything you need! They always have a smile on their faces and a warm welcome greeting! Already impressed, they sat us quite quickly and came with water with it.   The food! Amazing! Delicious! Came with a bit of time but the wait is definitely worth it! GET THE MAPLE BOURBON SAUCE YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED! I was super impressed with how fresh everything was, potato salad? Fresh. Ribs? Fresh. Fries? FRESH! The sauces they give you are all made in house and each one of them is super tasty! I got the ribs and personally I should've gone with the more lean cut because I don't like a lot of fat on my ribs but the St. Louis is still dang pretty good! Not super sweet as you may think and it impacts such a big flavor on the ribs overall flavor! The fries were very crispy and salted just perfectly, I like to taste the fries without sauces and quite frankly they don't need any! The potato salad was not overwhelming and is quite subtle with the ribs. Cornbread on the other hand wasn't as moist as I hoped it to be but the hush puppies were AMAZING! So delectable and tasty!!   The environment here is so welcoming and humble!! A very friendly environment, with laughs and joy all around!! That is super impactful on a restaurant's status because no one wants to go to a dull and sad restaurant... IF YOU ARE EVER IN CALGARY COME HERE TO EAT!! YOU WONT REGRET IT I PROMISE!! I'm a big foodie and here it is so worth the wait. Ironically I'm from Texas and this place beats barbecue back home by a long shot.... sorry"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ ribs, not the best  but I enjoyed them. The price is decent and portions are huge."}
{"text":"Very good ribs!! Definitely in my top 5 ribs ever had. I really liked the maple bourbon sauce"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family for dinner and received a warm welcome, promptly seated, and the server wasted no time offering to get our order started. She took time to explain local favourites from the menu and answered all questions.   Now onto the food - DELICIOUS! Even the kids cheeseburger was great (my wife tried it) and we had both the St.Louis Ribs, & Pulled Pork. Sides were great too (even the homemade mash with gravy was a stand out item). Also loved the bucket of other BBQ sauce flavours that get brought to your table. This is what good BBQ tastes like."}
{"text":"I really don't know why I keep going back to Big T's.  The food is just average but the service is abysmal.   The waitstaff are always surly and even the most mundane request is met with contempt."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Excellent southern BBQ, great sides (beans were very good, smashed potatoes and gravy were insane), blues playing as they should be, some local craft beers on tap, a couple TVs for sports, very nice decor, friendly and efficient service.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The BBQ here is quite good.  I have to be honest.  I don't frequent too many BBQ places but from my limited experiences I find Big T's BBQ to be up there.  The prices are reasonable and service was prompt and polite.  The sides are plentiful and have lots of choices.  The cornbread is pretty good (I have experience with that)."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. The food is amazing but the service is absolutely atrocious. As I write this I've been waiting over 40 mins since coming in for brunch. And the place is over half empty. Please do something about this big T!!!  I can't deal with this poor service!! Ended up leaving after waiting almost an hour. Staff were unapologetic. That is NOT how you treat customers."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, had good service regardless of the reviews... Plenty of food for a good price."}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware!  Seriously.  If you don't like meat, don't go to Big T's!  I was almost sick after leaving my meal at Big T's.  Not because I don't like meat or because the food was bad or anything like that, but because I saw and ate so much meat  it's enough to make anyone sick, even the strongest of carnivores.    I went in with a group and actually ordered a group meal.  They brought out a giant platter of all these different kinds of barbecued meat.  There was different smoked meat, chicken, ribs, and pulled pork.  It was served with a bunch of fries and other sides, like salad and potatoes.  It was just enough for the four of us, but I was with two other girls and one boy.  If it were all big eaters, we would have needed something a little extra.  If you are a meat-lover, you will most definitely LOVE Big T's.  They know their meat, and they serve it well."}
{"text":"Went to Big T's when my Friend was back in town, so we had a group of 4 so the obvious thing to do was get the Elvis Platter!  If you don't know what the Elvis Platter is, it is just a large platter filled with meat and fries! All of the meat was very good, I'm not a huge fries person so I didn't eat very much of it but they were good as well. The small side dishes such as the beans were mostly very tasty, but as usual my one complaint of Big T's is the coleslaw, they just don't serve very tasty coleslaw which was a sentiment our entire table shared which is a big disappointment as that was basically the only veggies on that platter (fries don't count). I can't comment on the corn bread as I don't like corn bread but my compatriots stated that it was fine, it's corn bread.  The Pulled pork and the riblets were our overall favourites, I barely got to taste the chicken as I was already bloated meat sack.   Overall great experience if you like Meat, and having boxes of food to bring home. I like the decor, it has that Southern BBQ Feel to it. Pricing is not the cheapest, but splitting the platter up is actually quite economical if you have around 4-6 people (trust me there's more than enough food on that thing to go around)."}
{"text":"Massive portions. Meat and more meat. Not really the place to bring your vegetarian friends but if you do, the deep fried dill pickles and hush puppies are to die for.  Had the Gut Buster sandwich ($18.50) which consists of a hoagie bun loaded with cheese, jalapeños, brisket, pulled pork, andouille sausage, and topped with caramelized onions.  Save room for dessert. The Smoked Maple Cheesecake was out of this world."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and we got there around 5:30p.m. there was no waiting time we got sat down really quick. The waitress was very friendly and very knowledgeable about the gluten free. My partner cant have gluten, so the waitress really made sure what would be good for her to choose from, and there was plenty on the menu. For myseld I order the \"meat loaf dinner\" the meat loaf was very flavorful and juicy, had 2 sides to choose, dirty rice and it was just the right amount of spice, the second sides were deep fried tomatoes, those were amazing. I would come back for sure"}
