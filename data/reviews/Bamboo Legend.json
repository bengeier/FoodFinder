{"text":"Craving for Vietnamese pho and happened to drive by this place. It said it was a Thai and Vietnamese restaurant so we went in. Looking at the menu it only had 4 Vietnamese soup and no other dishes so we settled for Thai food. The food was quite good and very tasty. Particularly good was the basil veggie and tofu."}
{"text":"If your new to Tai, this place might excite you, however if you know this style of food at all, this place is pretty average if not below.. Red curry has a nice taste which was the saving grace, however it has a soupy consistency, where as a good red curry sauce will run thicker with more depth in taste.. They use frozen vegetables, overcooked shrimp, creamcheese wantons were also overcooked (should be somewhat soft on the shell)  and all thought they look large on the outside, if you break open you will find a very small amount of ingredient Inside, as opposed to many others.. 
With stiff competition from place like 'Ben Thanh' just up the road, I was surprised these guys didn't live up to their 'legendary' name, and bring some competition to the area, especially with the premium prices they ask.. Back to Ben Thanh we go!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars if I could. Because of the proximity to my workplace, I've been going here for almost four years, everything is fairly consistent. 
- Tom yum soup is bland and they overdo it with the cilantro. I had the good fortune of trying their special pumpkin dill soup one day and it was damn good stuff (even if it wasn't specifically thai).
- Basil chicken is very good, and their creamy coconut curry is fantastic. It's what keeps me coming back. 
- I'd pass on the fish cakes, calamari, tango mango chicken and massaman curry. I found them all to be one dimensional and boring.

Unless you get the lunch specials, I find their dishes to be overpriced for the portion size, especially since you have to pay additional for rice. 

The restaurant is clean and homey. The dine in service can be slow, but friendly."}
{"text":"I went with a friend, the restaurant was very clean and quiet. We were served immediately and the server was nice. We ordered the chicken spring rolls, drunken noodles, and coconut soup with shrimp. The chicken spring rolls and drunken noodles were very good. The coconut soup was ok, it needed more flavour. For dessert we had the mango coconut sticky rice which was the best. The mango was very fresh and the rice was perfectly sweet!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai restaurant and has been for a while now. While the service varies, the food is constantly on point and is good enough to keep the 5 star rating. Their food is always fresh and full of flavour. The coconut soup is probably the most incredible thing my taste buds have had the pleasure of eating, and I wish I could take a giant pot home with me. I mean, I'm really not much of a soup person but this one is something I could live off of. Salty, creamy, sweet, tons of fresh veggies and tofu that's never overcooked. The coconut curry is also one of my favourites as it's packed full of deep, well built flavours. 

Only minor issues that I would have with this place is the service can be slow at times since they usually only have one person working, and the spice level on the food (especially curries) changes from day to day. Some days its mild and some its relatively hot. Being a spice lover I personally don't mind but this could pose an issue for some. 

All in all, if you're looking for a good quality Thai meal at an affordable price I would highly suggest this place, it's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This was my go to place for Thai food. Not anymore. My Chicken Pad Thai tasted like someone dumped salt in it. My girlfriend's Vegie Pad Thai was burnt (apparently it's possible) and there was onions in it even though we confirmed with the waitress that there shouldn't be any. When I told the waitress my food was too salty she gave me a dirty look, didn't even offer to make me another at first. Finally she offers after we asked if there's anything she can do, but at this point I was fed up with the whole situation. After I politely refused she left the plate in front of me and left. We didn't eat our food but was still forced to pay for everything, even the other patrons were in disbelief."}
{"text":"We went to try out this place based on the positive reviews it had received and it was conveniently close to where we were bowling afterwards. The place was fairly empty when we arrived and we were told we could seat ourselves wherever we wanted. 

I had ordered the hot and sour soup, which was quite underwhelming. It was neither sour nor very hot. I wasn't expecting the black pepper in the soup nor the bell pepper, and there was a fair amount of oil in it. 

We had ordered the chicken creamy curry with two bowls of rice. The waitress had told us it was a very large portion and said that one of those dishes could last her three meals. When the dish came out, it was definitely not as large as we thought it would be. I don't consider myself to be a huge eater, but I could have definitely cleaned up the entire plate on my own. The curry itself was alright, it was mainly string beans, some red bell pepper and chicken peices, not the best curry I have had. 

We had wanted to order a second curry dish but couldn't get the waitress's attention so we had to go up to the counter to order. The service was slow, and the food wasn't impressive. Will not be my first choice for thai food."}
{"text":"Great $14.99 dinner special that included a mango salad, spring rolls or fish cakes, chicken curry and a small dessert! Good, friendly service. Clean place. Wasn't very busy but I'd be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food always great. Cozy warm atmosphere and owners and staff that truly care about their customers."}
{"text":"A friend and I went this evening  for my second visit at the Oakville Third Line location.  I was very impressed with the curried dish I had the first time and wanted to take my friend here for something a little different.

First let me say that he restaurant was spotless!  Very very clean! The interior is smallish but tastefully decorated and had a nice cosy and inviting feeling.  This restaurant is a family run business with 2 locations.  The third Port Credit location was flooded out and closed down so I'm told.

Our visit was on a Wednesday and there were only 3 other tables being served.  Our waitress was very attentive and recommended 2 dishes.  The drunken noodles (we added beef) and the  Creamy Curry Coconut - Panang (we added chicken).  A bowl shaped clump of sticky rice also came with the meal.  Both were absolutely delicious!  We both had Singha to drink (Thai beer) also very good.

My only complaints are the portion sizes were slightly too small and both dishes could have been a little hotter (temperature wise).

I'll definitely be going back again in the near future."}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant you will ever experience!! Its difficult to narrow down my favourite dishes because everything is so good, but I could eat the Green Curry and Panag Curry every day. I have tried many Thai Restaurants all over the GTA and Bamboo's Pad Thai and Crabmeat Wonton's are unbeatable !!"}
{"text":"Great food and good customer service. Spicy basil chicken was pretty delicious ( they even had black peppercorn stem buds plenty of them actually) the drunken noodles tasted great but lacked sauce , I thought they will be dipped in gravy/sauce."}
{"text":"Friendly service experience with a smile.  I get the green curry every time, my wife gets the Bamboo Legend Pad Thai and swears by it.

The crab won tons are great too. They make a great exotic bites when you don't want to show up at somebody's house empty handed."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food. Had the chicken satay and the curried soft shell crab and was thoroughly satisfied."}
{"text":"Great spot in Mississauga. Spacious enough to accommodate a baby. Definitely recommend visiting when you're in the area. Dinner visit. Food is delicious and service is awesome. Had the green Thai curry dinner special with mango salad and dessert. Fried calamari is a great starter! L"}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese beef on rice vermicelli.  Also sweet and sour lemongrass soup is tasty."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Pad Thai which is an obvious go-to was very good. Cashew chicken was also excellent. Only did take out but inside of restaurant is very nice looking and servers seem very nice. Great Thai"}
{"text":"Local , homely, always great food and service. Try the drunken noodles or the green chicken curry with coconut rice  . We always get both for take out . Food is always well made and rest for pickup on time."}
{"text":"Disgusting food ... Tried it twice! First time around ... the service was super slow and the chicken overcooked. second time ... The pad Thai was super dry with hardly any flavour. :(
Will never try again."}
{"text":"Me: \"What the heck is fusion pad thai?\"
BL: \"It's pad thai with tomato sauce.\"
Me: \"So it's wet like spaghetti?\"
BL: \"No it's dry like pad thai.\"
Me: \"But is it sweet like spaghetti sauce?\"
BL: \"No, it's savory, you know, like pad thai...\"
Me: \"OoOooohhh...\"

...this had to have continued for a few minutes until...
BL: \"You should just try it...  Sounds like you'd like it...  It's like ... uh... pad thai.\"


Yada yada yada...  it was amazing.  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"After circling the block a couple times, I found Bamboo Legend tucked in the back of a big parking lot next to a Marble store that you can probably see from Dundas (take your second right after Winston Churchill). I did a take our order of Pad Thai and Chicken Satay (my standard measure of a Thai restaurant. Upon ariving, I discovered it was Viet-Thai restaurant - even better! My Pad Thai was delicious, although not as spicy as I anticipated. Satay was juicy and the accompanying peanut sauce and pickle salad thing was the perfect side dish. Will return if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Last minute lunch choice on a Saturday. Family wanted to try Thai. Had the Chicken (maybe Curry) Pad Thai (spice level 4) and it was amazing. Red Curry couldve been more spicy but overall definitely a great Thai experience!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai resto by far. Haven't had any place like it! Located by Dundas and Winston Churchill, in the CIBC plaza. The google maps doesn't show it up properly sometimes. Hard to explain, but whatevs.

I've taken a few friends here, and one of them said \"this place is the most authentic Thai place I've eaten at... the presentation, the way food is prepared...\" They also serve BOTH types of Pad Thai (tomato sauce red and regular).

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND...
- Philly Crab Meat Wontons
- Authentic Pad Thai (non red)
- Curry Soft Shell Crab"}
{"text":"I ordered a mango salad with chicken, dressing on the side. When my order arrived, dressing was on the salad and the waitress claimed I never asked for dressing on the side. In addition, the chicken was untrimmed thighs and had a lot of fat on it. Service was poor, quality was mediocre. Wasn't terrible but wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Great food! We did take away and the spice level and portions are perfect."}
{"text":"A nice little Thai restaurant tucked away in Oakville/Mississauga, Bamboo Legend offers good food at fair prices. Lunch will run about $10 a person, and you get your selection of red, green and concunt curries (with beef, chicken, shrimp, etc.), pad Thai and other traditional Thai food.

The shrimp red curry was nicely flavored, and you can add some hot sauce and chili to spice it up some more. 

It didn't blow me away (but I've only tried one dish), but it's a nice, quiet place to have a lunch with a friend or two.  I'll come back to try other dishes as well!"}
{"text":"It's been about 4 years since I have been to Bamboo Legend.

We were greeted kindly and ended up being the only diners while we were there. The establishment seemed clean.

He ordered seafood pad thai. I got the chicken pad thai. We were never offered drinks. Strangely two glasses of water arrived after we were done eating. The seafood in the pad thai wasn't fresh. My chicken pad thai was standard but nothing special. We both found the portions to be small.

Not blown away. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Friendly service and nice decor.

Ordered bamboo legend fresh rolls, curry pad Thai, and the mango chicken.

The fresh rolls were really fresh and tasty and came with a tamarind dipping sauce.  Curry pad Thai was spicy and was a generous mound of noodles with some veggies although not sure cabbage is a good veggie for pad Thai.  Mango chicken was a runny mess of sauce with slices of chicken breast and a couple of slices of mango.  Not very good IMHO.

Place was quiet when we came in but it took over 20 minutes to get our fresh rolls and another 15 to get our mains.  They seem to have a steady stream of takeout orders for pick up which may have affected service for eat in clients."}
{"text":"I decided to give Bamboo Legend the benefit of the doubt and give them another try to see if they would surpass my last experience dining with them and hope that my next updated review would be more on the positive side. Sadly, as you will read, it did not. 

We ordered 1 pho with well done rare beef and beef ball & 1 grilled chicken over vermicelli with spring rolls. I wondered why the extra complimentary sides (either choice of ginger salad or Tom Yum Soup which come with meals off the lunch menu) were even bothered being offered. 

TOM YUM SOUP & GINGER SALAD:
The Tom Yum Soup, was disappointing to say the least. It came in a teeny-tiny bowl and felt very watered down without having any broth or real substance to it. The tofu in the soup was cut smaller than bite-size pieces and there were hardly any pieces in it. The ginger salad contained about 1-2 iceberg lettuce leaves which graced a small blue trimmed plate, with 1 cucumber slice, 1 tomato slice and 1/4 of a cut carrot slice... 

WELL-DONE RARE BEEF with BEEF BALL PHO:
There was some sort of strange smell and weird after taste to it. It just didn't taste fresh. The bowl was rather full with noodles than broth or anything else. 

THE SERVICE:
Nothing has changed since my last visit here and this happened yet again. Just when we had come in before another customer, the other customer got served before us (it made me wonder if I had something on my face). I mean there has to be some sequence to serving customers, right?

After yet another disappointing service experience and low food quality, I'm pretty sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was awful and the food was disappointing. 

I asked for no peanuts in my papaya salad and it arrived with peanuts. No problem. People make mistakes. The salad was delicious except that it's only 30% papaya and the rest is carrots. I didn't expect a carrot salad when I ordered a papaya salad. 

Next when I ordered my curry, I asked for extra spicy. When he brought my dish I asked if it was spicy. He stutters saying \"... Yes?\" but turns out he forgot. He then brought me every single type of spice from the kitchen, which was a nice gesture but still very disappointing. 

The sticky rice was soggy and couldn't be traditionally eaten with fingers. Every time I picked it up, it would fall apart. I was brought up with traditional Lao and Thai cuisine and sticky rice is supposed to be sticky. Right? 

I wouldn't recommend going here. I gave 2 stars for the nice decor."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Mississauga. This location on Winston Churchill and Dundas isn't very busy (we usually come on Friday evenings, and it isn't busy at all), but the staff is superb and the food is incredibly delicious. On our last visit, I ordered the Green Curry special with Sticky Rice and Papaya Salad ($13.99) and my boyfriend ordered one of their Pad Thais ($10.99). The portions are large (particularly the special I ordered), and was so very flavourful. I've also ordered their chicken satay appetizer with peanut sauce, and it was delicious! I'd highly recommend this place - the staff is friendly, and I believe they have a number of vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"The place is like a Vietnamese pho restaurant but more fancy. The service what a nice lady who was very patient and polite. The tables were mostly in fours (as in # of chairs) and some in six. The music was calming and everything was pretty neat and clean. The washroom for the girls inly had two stalls and was somewhat small but it was fine because it was clean. The menu had starters and main meals from Vietnam and mostly Thailand. I got the glass noodles which came with a small salad on the plate it was served in and my brother got the chicken and shrimp pad thai. They were both pretty good but I liked the glass noodles better because the flavour wasn't as strong. The pad thai was made with tamarind sauce and tasted like it had some spice like cardamom or coriander. (Not that knowledgeable in spices sorry). My little brother ordered the chicken spring rolls and it came with a dauce that was slightly vinegary. The spring rolls were basically two giant ones cut in half. There weren't that much meat in them, mostly vegetables. The outer part of the springroll was really crispy which was nice. Overall the experience was good."}
{"text":"We had a birthday dinner here for my sister in April. The food wasn't so great... the pad thai tasted like ketchup which is my number 1 sign to run. I tried a bunch some of other people's dishes and nothing but the fried chicken wings were good. The green curry tasted like water and not a lot of ingredients.

On top of that, a restaurant should never accept a reservation for a party if they can't accommodate. Nothing ruins a party more than having food come out sporadically over 2.5 hours. 

My sister and I noticed new tables getting their food consistently while some of our guests were kept waiting for over an hour and a half. Apparently to not piss off the other guests they staggered our bill and made other orders ahead of ours so some of our guests got lucky and the others got the bad end of the stick. 

We were having the birthday cake by the time my sister in law got her dinner which everyone felt bad about. 

They ended up giving her a 10 or 15% discount but everyone else who waited almost as long got nothing.

No apologies were offered with the discount and I really had to ask them to compensate her. 

Better thai places in Mississauga fortunately."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai place in Port Credit but unfortunately my very brief review is largely in vain because I just found out that they'll be closing on June the 29th and I feel pretty bad. Even though I live quite close by, I only recently popped in for the first time and it was after dropping in yesterday (my second visit) that I found out that they'll be shutting down...could I have done more? My server (and the sign out front) said that the owners want to take a break to pursue other interests and travel after eight years of running the place but might they have stayed in business had I frequented their place more often? I guess we'll never know for sure.

Anyways, the \"Authentic\" Pad Thai (tamarind sauce) is very good and the \"Classic\" (sweet tomato) is even better. Also highly recommend the spring rolls and especially the crispy tofu. Nice, fast, friendly service and it's a rather lovely and well adorned spot in an otherwise nondescript strip mall. 

So try them out if you can in the next couple of days. Otherwise, I guess it'll have to be one of Port Credit's several other Thai restaurants which shouldn't be a problem: as a previous review stated, there's no shortage of them. But I do think that Bamboo Legend was the best of the bunch, so I'll miss it and wish them well in their future endeavors!"}
{"text":"We just had a tasteful meal with good portions and a friendly atmosphere. My new favorite Thai foot restaurant."}
{"text":"We went to try  this place because of all the positive reviews. 

I exceptionally loved their decor. The food was okay, not the best. 

Would probably not go here as a first choice for thai food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for amazing Thai food this is the spot. I'm rarely on the West end of the city so finding this spot was pretty rare. 

Apps: satay chicken, chicken wings, and crab wontons. All amazing, though my favourite was the wontons delicious cheese sauce on the side.

Mains: authentic Pad Thai, Panang curry, shrimp and chicken vegetables, and Thai fried rice. 

9/10 service, 9/10 food, 8/10 ambience. 

Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, service was good, maybe needing a bit more interaction with their guests.  Had Chicken Tom Yum soup which was awesome.  Also Green Curry Chicken with Jasmine Rice.  The flavours were great, but the Green Curry Chicken had an oily film which masked the coconut flavours.  I'd still come back tho !!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots in Mississauga for Thai cuisine. When you have a craving for pad thai, this place is difficult to beat. Everything I've tried has been very good to excellent. I have not tried everything, but my sample size would lead me to believe everything else is at least the same quality for taste and portions.

The decor is very nice, hand-made from what I've been told. This is the new location from the old one right on Lakeshore and Hurontario. 

I've been greeted by the owner each time I've eaten here. Super nice guy, this chain is a family run business and he is definitely very passionate about his restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but sadly I didn't. The staff were friendly, but service in general was lacklustre. It took us too long to get our order in and when we asked for extra cutlery we never received it. The place wasn't busy either, it was less than half full, so we can't chalk it up to busyness either. 

Now for the food:

Green Curry Beef - the meat was tough, the veggies lack seasoning and the bamboo shoots in the curry itself was overwhelming. They need to wash the shoots more before they put it in because it really ruined the flavour profile of the dish. (1/5)

Calamari - below average, doesn't taste fresh and is akin to those frozen calamari rings you can get at Walmart. The tangy mayo that came alongside was decent (2/5)

Soft shell crab curry - I thought this was the best dish of the night. Again, the veggies seemed like an afterthought, or just randomly chosen to add bulk to the dish. (3/5)

My sister also ordered the teaser Thai iced tea for two bucks, and it came in one of those glasses you serve bourbon in (as pictured below). I thought they made their iced tea quite well actually, most other places make the drink far too sweet and with too little of that tea flavour, so this was really pleasant and refreshing. 

I may order one of those iced teas to go someday, but I'm pretty sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"Friends and I got some take out from here. We got the daily special, which was either a red or green curry, mango or papaya salad, and spring rolls or fish cakes for $16. Considering there were 5 of us, they were pretty quick at preparing our meals.

I got the green curry, mango salad, and spring rolls. Spring rolls were deliciously crispy even after a car ride, and stuffed full. Mango salad was nice and fresh with lots of mango slivers. Green curry was full of flavour and had just the right amount of kick. The portion size was slightly on the smaller side, but that could be just the take out. 

Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch and boy was it delicious. Their lunch menu is amazing with loads of choices, decent price and decent portion. For $10 you get a soup or salad and entrée which for me was Pad Thai with chilli flakes on the side (got to add a little heat).

The food was flavourful, presented nicely, perfect portion and was brought to us quickly. Each bite was always better than the last. It's got the perfect amount of vegetables and peanuts and grease, awesome combo right! The soup was tasty and a good way to prep me before devouring my meal.

Next time, I will try their drunken noodle entrée which looked really good. Similar to the Pad Thai, its filled with peanuts, vegetables and grease. Can't go wrong.

The service was pleasant. My water glass was always full and our plates were taken away as soon as were done. The place was also, nice and clean which put me in a zen like mood.

Would I come back here again, most definitely!"}
{"text":"We just randomly went to this place for a quick dinner. It was a pleasant surprise. The food was great.  Staff was courteous. Loved coconut curry. 

Being vegetarian we do not have many places/ choices to eat  but happy to find this hidden gem. 

Will go again."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food and portion sizes are really good. Always nice to go in with a couple of friends to enjoy some thai curry!! Their lunch specials are great too, and so are their combo's. Thai green curry and basil chicken are the best!! 
The service isn't always the best and have to always insist on getting water, napkins etc. Funny how that's an issue even when it's not too busy. 
Other than that - everything is really good. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, we just moved to Oakville from Toronto. My girlfriend and I tried this place based on the high ratings. It's not bad, however not up to the standards we were used to in the city. The place seems very...white-washed (and I say that as a white person). The decor looks like a mixture of pottery barn, they serve you water in mason jars, and there is hand sanitizer on the tables for lord's sake. Also no Thai iced tea to speak of (come on!)
As for the food - we had the crab wontons to start (which were good), followed by a lemongrass soup and a basil chicken dish. The soup was a little bland, and the basil chicken was rather salty. Having cooked Thai dishes before, I'm not sure why they are adding so much salt to the meals  Fish sauce and curry paste should give you all you need.

Overall...a half-decent meal, on the expensive side for a Thai restaurant (average entree is $15), would have given 2.5 stars for the entire experience. Doubtful would try again."}
{"text":"This is easily my fav thai/asian restaurant hands down! Been going here for quite some time now, since it opened actually. This place is seriously a hidden gem, it looks tiny from the outside but its very beautiful, clean and quiet on the inside! The owners and workers here a extremely friendly. The best thing about the place is the FOOD! The food is amazing! Everything I have tried has been delicious. My personal fav's are the drunken noodle, chicken pad thai, celantro chicken, basil chicken, crispy chicken wings, mango salad, calamari with the sauce! Chicken/pork Vermicelli! Uggh! To many to name! Anyways, I would highly recommend this place to anyone! Also, they have great lunch specials! Go here now! You wont be dissapointed! :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be good. But the price went up and the quality went down. However there is really no good Vietnam/Thai place around the area. Overall, its a ok place considering there is really no decent Vietnam/Thai cuisine to choose."}
{"text":"I come here often and noticed a few changes since the management has changed. Not quite the same as before.  But still pretty good. My favorite is the soft shelled crab dish which is very hard to find. Great selection."}
{"text":"Great food and Great service. We had the Red Curry with seafood, Cilantro - Kha Tiam Prik with chicken and Thai Eggplant & Basil with beef. All very good, I would recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"We've been going to Bamboo Legend since it opened, many years ago. At first, the food was great, the service was great and we had no complaints. Over the years, the food seemed to go downhill a bit and when we'd order wine, they had nothing left on the wine list except the most expensive wines. We gave up a few years ago and just stopped going.

We decided to give it another try and were pleasantly surprised that the food is once again delicious. The three of us ordered different noodle dishes and other than the lack of spice, we were very happy with them. All were very tasty and the portions were plentiful. We also ordered the calamari and the fish cakes as appetizers. The calamari was very tasty, as was the dipping sauce. The fish cakes were some of the best Thai fish cakes we've had. They were cooked just perfectly, rather than being a little overdone and rubbery as is often the case.

Our only real complaint about the food was that it wasn't very hot. Everything was warmer than room temperature, but not as piping hot as it should have been.

The main reason for my 3-star review instead of 4-star was that the service was just terrible. We were told to sit wherever we wanted to, but sat for at least 5 minutes before getting menus. Then we waited at least another 15 minutes for the server to come back over to take orders. He didn't even mention drinks, just said \"okay, what do you want to order?\". No apologies were offered for the time we had waited. 

A table came in while were were sitting. They waited 15 minutes and walked out. We also heard others complaining that they had been waiting too long for service and heard the server apologize several times to others. 

The restaurant wasn't overly busy, but there was only one server and I think that was the problem. Once we put in our orders, the food came out fairly quickly so it wasn't a problem with the kitchen.

Having said all that, the food was good and we will most likely be going back. We've also ordered take out once since that visit and the food was just as good and piping hot."}
{"text":"I wish I could write a positive review but so many things went wrong when we went for lunch today.  I'm not sure where to start.

For starters, the service was not good.  It was slow, haphazard, and potentially overwhelmed as well.  It was a very busy lunch with a fair number of tables.  There was 2 waitresses.  They were not rude at all... if anything, they were courteous but just not aware and they made errors on other tables.  They gave people soup when they ordered salad, they delivered items to the wrong tables... just a bunch of noticeable small things.

The food is where lots of things faltered.  I first got my salad and wow, it was really disappointing.  There was maybe 12 iceberg lettuce leaves and half of them were limp and pink edged because they were OLD.  I have a picture of it on my phone but I won't post it here because it's unpleasant looking.

In terms of the actual entree, the spicy Thai basil with shrimp was flavourful.  It was plated fairly nicely but the size was eye raising as in disappointing.  I may have gotten only 5 shrimp on the entire plate.  There was maybe 1/4 red pepper, less than half a carrot, and maybe 1/2 cup of green beans.  I couldn't believe how little food there was.  I looked at other tables and they were the exact same except they had a ridiculously giant portion of rice (I asked for no rice).  It's clear they use a lot of filler rice and rice noodles in their lunch portions to get the person full.

My husband's order didn't fare any better.  He had the green curry combo that came with fish cakes and papaya salad.  The salad portion was big but there was very little papaya.  It was mostly cabbage and carrot.  The 3 fish cakes were tasty but they weren't very large (notice a trend?) and his green curry was ridiculously small.  It was in a tiny soup bowl with zero vegetables and maybe less than 1/3 cup of chicken.  The largest thing on his plate was the rice... it was probably 1.5 cups of rice.  

I did try his curry and it was very tasty and flavourful.  So I will say that this restaurant is talented but they're cheap and they have poor quality.  The other reason for saying that aside from our substandard meal was that the table beside us found a HAIR in their curry.  Ew!  I cannot recommend this place to anyone in good conscience.  It's too bad as I think they do make great tasting food but not good meals."}
{"text":"For some reason, Port Credit is littered with Thai restaurants. What's even more strange is having two Bamboo Legends less than 1km apart. The one in the Metro plaza is spacious and quiet around lunch time. The menu is very simple. 

The green curry was rich and silky but I didn't think the string beans were a good fit. I would complain about the small portions but other dishes like the pad thai or fried rice seemed to come in more generous portions. A couple of people in our group had to take half their Pad Thais home.  

Positives: 
Very spacious and nicely decorated 
Friendly and attentive staff
You get a decent meal for $10

My pet peeves: 
They have a nice looking bar but serve beer in dirty old bottles
The side salad is actually a fist of Dole Mix with a squirt of ginger dressing"}
{"text":"We used to come to bamboo legend a lot back in 2007, but the service and food went down. Everything was inconsistent and slow. But we decided to try it again.

The service was just as slow, but there should be more than one server. We waited a long time to have our order taken and we ordered waters which didn't get there until we had to ask again. The server was a bit frantic as well.

Our starters were calamari and fish cakes, the fish cakes were good. The calamari was good, but lukewarm, still crispy and the sauce was nice.

When we ordered our mains, he didn't ask for a spice level and by the time we got order we had forgotten about that. He also never checked in on us or asked how our food was. He also was out of the wine we wanted and tried to up sell us to the highest priced bottle.

The mains were great, despite the service. I had the Drunken Noodles. The overall flavour was amazing. The vegetables and noodles were cooked perfectly. The beef was a bit over and it could've been spicier. I definitely recommend the Drunken noodles.

Ambience is nice and clean, nothing has changed. Their plants need water as well."}

{"text":"It's a lovely small restaurant and it's tucked away in the corner of the plaza. Around lunch time it  always gets very busy. The server is super polite and friendly. The dishes are flavourful and delicious. The portions are adequate and sometimes too much for me to finish. Love their authentic pad thai, pineapple fried rice, Cilantro and Ginger. The other thing I love about this place is they are very vegan friendly. They have quite a few veggie dishes on their menu and they are more than happy to accommodate for my vegan diet. Most importantly, it's really not that expensive at all. Their lunch special is just $7.99. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes on the menu."}
