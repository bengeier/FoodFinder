{"text":"Everything was EXCELLENT!!Scallop Risotto OMG.Great pick for Charlotte Restaurant week. Thanks to George the owner. Just great.  A must visit. We will be back"}
{"text":"This place is great! Great service and food, plus the owners were very warm and inviting. 

Started with Calamari and the arancini bites, both were incredible. Arancini bites are hard to find around here, so I'd definitely reccomend those. 

I had the scallop special with rissoto and my husband had the pork tenderloin medallions. I HIGHLY reccomend both. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Me and my family tried this place for lunch last Saturday after my sons basketball game. Weather was nice so we asked to sit outside (better for kids). The decor seemed to suggest a semi-upscale place. Our server was fine. Food was not. The fries came out cold and the cheese on my sons grilled cheese was barely melted. My tuna melt and my wife's reuben were average. This would have been understandable if we were at an average diner. Prices were on the expensive side. As I waited to pay for the overpriced food, my wife on sons waited for me on the sidewalk. My youngest son picked up a few pebbles and some crotchety man (owner/manager?) came out and yelled at him to put down the rocks. Bottomline: overpriced average food in a pretentious want-to-be-upscale-bistro setting."}
{"text":"Never again, take my advice and stay away. $175 for dinner for 2 (including a cheap bottle of wine). We had a inattentive waitress who was rude and condescending when I ordered the special which was lamb. \"Its really expensive are you sure,\" is what she said even though they were not that expensive. They were horrible though, very fatty and overcooked. Not good at all. Needless to say the whole experience just sucked and will not be returning which is a shame because the place is very close to my house. It's cute from the outside but the inside is like walking into the 70's and the place needs updating. Like a complete overhaul."}
{"text":"The food was very slow to be served and the portions were so small, as compared to what we paid. It only took one time to understand that this is not a place to return."}
{"text":"We ate at Cafe 157 last night and all 4 of us had excellent meals. The crab cakes were excellent, as were the very rich chocolate mousse cakes. We will definitely return.

Most restaurants are so loud these days that you can't talk across the table. It was so nice to be in a quiet environment with plenty of room between tables and no blasting music."}
{"text":"visited this restaurant during restaurant week. The food was good and the atmosphere was great ser ice was also very good. If you have not tried it go check them out. This was my first time."}
{"text":"They should rename this place \"The Rip Off Palace of Mediocrity\". The food is average and The portions are small. They charge additional for everything.!!! Want cheese on your pasta? That's $1.50. Want bread? $2.75. If you must go here, don't make the same mistake we did and not ask for the prices of the special dishes. We got the special fish dish and was shocked that it was $36 and just fair. Oily and too many favors. Don't bother going unless you are satisfied with overpriced mediocrity."}
{"text":"I live in Mathews and the owner is an awful person. He said terrible things to my wife and son for parking there once. 

Now and then when my kids have an event at the karate school next-door I see this scumbag policing his parking lot. 

You may enjoy your dinner, but your children may hear the F word - depending where you park. This in the one and only place I haven't visited in my home-town for that reason. I tell all my neighbors and have boycotted the place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since moving to the area 9 months back and have never been disappointed.  Reasonable priced, well-crafted sandwiches for lunch and real yummy entrees for dinner.  The old bank-type building it inhabits provides a nice atmosphere and the service has been excellent.  I am not much of a foodie but my wife and sister are and they both love it too."}
{"text":"Im not sure which was better; the beginning of the meal when the waiter paid far too much attention to my party, or the second half of the meal when the waiter completely ignored my party. The moment my mother and I set foot in the restaurant an older male waiter wrapped an arm around my mother and led her to a table in a most uncomfortable way. He then proceeded to laugh about how my mother looked 18 years old and that she was too young to drink, not in a cute way, in a weird way. During the meal I received a text message and when I checked it, the waiter appeared at my table and condescendingly said \"Excuse me, what are you texting your boyfriend now?\" Well excuse me, last time I checked I am the customer, and I can do what I well please while I am eating.  The food was fine, but it had small portions, and really wasn't worth the price I paid for it.  The only highlight was when the male waiter stopped coming to service my table, we flagged down a waitress so we could pay our bill and she was so friendly and sweet. I can say without a doubt that I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Since we live only a few miles away, we wanted to try a local restaurant.   We should have left immediately when I noticed that only less than half of the tables were occupied at 7 pm on a Saturday night.  Word must have gotten around that Cafe 157 is overpriced and underwhelming.   The restaurant is positioning itself as an elegant dining experience based on the prices, but when the entr√©e arrived while we were still eating our salad, that was clue #1 that this was not to be an elegant dining experience. And the portion size is inadequate given the prices they are charging.  The food is average at best except for the dishes that are oversalted.  Stay away if you are looking for good food or value for  your dollar."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time during restaurant week and the overall experience was fine. I talked to Dora a couple times while making and confirming the reservation...she was super friendly and helpful! When I actually entered the restaurant, however, whoever greeted us probably shouldn't have been standing at the host stand. Our server was nice but seemed distracted. 

The food was fantastic...the salmon was cooked perfectly and the chocolate mousse cake was to die for!! I wanted to order 15 more pieces to take home!"}
{"text":"This was a very nice little restaurant in an old converted bank. It's in quaint downtown Matthews. Service was a little slow but the food more than made up for it. The fish and chips was fantastic. My business associates had the buttermilk fried chicken and it looked and tasted amazing. Cool little place that i will eat at again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. The atmosphere is very nice--refined but not stuffy. Service was friendly and attentive (but not too much). The restaurant was not very busy for lunch time, and my order was taken quickly. I ordered the cod sandwich. It was very tasty. The fish was flavorful, and the batter was crispy. 

Only downfall was that the server offered the choice of fries or salad with my sandwich. I opted for the salad. The salad was very good, but it appeared on my bill as a substitution with an added fee of $1.50. Not very happy about that. Otherwise, this place gets high marks from me.

Walked by the patio. It looks like a very inviting, fun place to dine. Checked out the restroom (ladies'). It was one of the cleanest restrooms I've seen in a restaurant! That is always a good thing."}
{"text":"We've been here a hand full of times and do enjoy the food. The last 2 times the service was amazing but it was hit or miss before that. The food has always been great. I ordered the Cajun pasta with chicken and it was really good. We will continue to eat here as it seems to get better everytime we go."}
{"text":"Nothing very adventurous on the menu but the food was solid. I enjoyed the wedge salad and pork tenderloin."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for the Democratic National Convention and was staying in Matthews. The hotel I was staying at recommended this place for my birthday and I was very pleased. 

The service was great. The server gave us some great recommendations and was very hospitable. Definitely lived up to my expectations of Southern Hospitality. The food was pretty good as well. The fried pickles were amazing. There had a light and extra crispy crust. I had the fried chicken, which was alright. Nothing spectacular, but well done. The folks I was with had their scallop special which was excellent. Possibly the best scallops I have ever had. The only complaint I have is that the beer menu is a little lacking but they did seem to have a good wine list. Also, the hostess was a little rude. I asked her to take a picture as it was my birthday, and she seemed really put out and snippy.

This is a great local place that I recommend to those passing through and living in or around Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant not only in the Matthews area, but all of south Charlotte.  Its one of the few places with excellent food, a casual atmosphere, and good wine / beer / cocktails.  Plus, there is beautiful outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"All servers are rude and we never got waited on. They just kept walking past us and acted like they were busy. Tried to give place a 2nd chance. Go to food truck Fridays instead. Food is terrible and overpriced."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and noticed the negatives were about service, price, and beer selection.  All of that seemed great to me.  We were there on a Thursday for lunch and it wasn't crowded so maybe the service problem is at more crowded times because for us it was excellent.  The server was there when we needed her but not in the way when we didn't.  The beer selection was perfectly adequate for a place this size as they had five or six craft beers on tap and many more in the bottle.  We decided to try several appetizers and the price for four large plates (more like meals) plus two craft beers and tea was just over $40.  The appetizers were so big two of us could not finish them completely.  On top of that we both agreed that three of them were the best of those dishes we've ever had anywhere!  The flatbread was excellent with thin crispy bread with just the right amount of tasty cheese and veggies.  The calamari was crisp on the outside (breading) and tender on the inside served with an excellent white sauce.  We've tried spinach and artichoke dip from hundreds of restaurants as it is one of our favorite snacks and the dip at Cafe 157 was the absolute best, no question, and served with fresh pita triangles that were perfect.  We will definitely return to check out their salads, sandwiches and dinner menu.  Oh, and did I mention that they have a very nice patio for enjoying the spring weather?"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time. Was ushered in with a friendly greeting by a very nice gentleman at the front door. We were here for restaurant week and they were offering both their queens fest menu and regular menu which was nice to have options! My husband and I chose the restaurant week menu. Lobster bisque was wonderful  (made from scratch) as well as the pork osso bucco and filet mignon. Our waitress was wonderful and attentive. Our food was very good but it was the service and personal attention and southern hospitality (something those of us from the north can really appreciate!) that will definitely put this on our list of places to return to! 

One recommendation would be to dim the lights a little. It was very bright in there."}
{"text":"The food the atmosphere the service has always been great and going to Caf√© 157. You can stay and eat with some drinks and just pop over to some of the local bars in downtown Matthews. I definitely recommend this place for any outing. 

I just went there and apparently made the mistake in parking at the parking lot for Cafe 157. Owner locked The parking lot. I was told that he locks it when the restaurant closes and does not open it again until he opens the restaurant. This would not be a big deal, but it was Saturday and they're closed Sunday and Monday. After spending over $200 at that location I will not be returning to Caf√© 157 despite the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment a few times. As Gado-Gado, and now Cafe 157. The food is good, service friendly and pricing reasonable. Every time I have been here was for a group dinner. They have a nice space off the main dining area that accommodates large parties (25-30). Nice bar area upon entering and the restaurant is very open. Location in downtown Matthews makes for a convenient lunch/dinner spot."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time last night during the Champagne tasting, the pairings were on awesome!  I am looking forward to the next tasting! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to spent over $100 and had to refuse my dinner which was lower quality chicken than buying a $1 McChicken @ McDonald's"}
{"text":"Everything was great. My family and I were there last night and the service was excellent. The food was perfect. The baguette was soooo delicious. You must try it. We ordered 3. I had the beef tenderloin and they were delicious plus the potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just perfect. My mom got the split pea soup and she said it was delicious. My husband got the burger and he said it had flavor and it was cooked perfectly. My brother got the crab cakes and that was delicious as well. Everything we had was yuuuummmy.  Also the lemon cake is soooo good. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhhh never again. Just keep on keeping on. You're welcome. Never had a good experience here."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in this restaurant and boy am I glad I did!  The service and food was amazing.  My table ordered 3 different entrees and all were awesome. We also ordered the a piece of chocolate mousse cake for dessert and a fight almost broke out because we only ordered one.  I will definitely be going back...maybe tonight."}
{"text":"Very little food for the price. Over priced for what you get. You don't even get a side of bread or a small salad with your entre. Their sandwiches sound good but we got entres that were just ok. We had to go through a fastfood restaurant for a side salad to even feel like we'd had dinner (and no, we're not big fatties who need tons of food).

If you're a guy, beware of the urinal. There's some sort of attachment in it that splashes urine back on your pants."}
{"text":"I really like Cafe 157. Although the menu is not very adventurous, the food that is served is always very good. The Fried Pickles... To. Die. For. I usually have the salmon and the chef will always cook it Medium Rare for me. I love him for that! I will say, the Salmon entree used to come with a fried polenta cake but now it's served with just rice. Yawn. Being half Italian and half Sicilian, ( please understand I have to say I am half Sicilian or my Sicilian Mother will flip her lid), I need the fried polenta cake put back on the menu. It was DELISH!!!

From the previous reviews, I know this place gets a bad wrap for slow service but I have never had a problem. Of course when we dine there, we are usually not in a hurry anyway. Our server last night was super attentive and very professional. He even was nice enough to move our party from outside to inside last night without hesitation. It seems the local bees wanted to join us for dinner and my children were not happy with the dinner crashers.

Cafe 157 use to have Dinner and Wine pairing events but I haven't seen them advertised lately. These are/were great events. For X amount of dollars you get a 3-4 course meal and a different wine with every course. The chef comes out to explain the dish and the Sommelier explains his/her choice of wine paring. It's a fun event with no more than 20 people. You get to eat good food, drink good wines and meet some new people. What more can you ask for? I do hope they bring the event back. It was always a good time."}
{"text":"First time visit, and we were so impressed!  The building is an old bank, and has plenty of character.  The staff was so pleasant, and the food was amazing!  Dora was our waitress, she was very honest about the menu.  She also had us laughing the whole meal!  It was a great date night destination for us and the other couple we were with.  Definitely a hidden gem in Charlotte.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"If you're in Matthews you must go. The little place was phenomenal!! The owners are very much involved in the day to days and always greeting customers. A must stop in Matthews, the beet and arugula salad is my lunch go to and the dinner specials rotate ALWAYS amazing. The owner makes a great martini"}
{"text":"Would definitely not recommend, as we got food poisoning there. My wife and I had dinner on August 13th and both had contaminated beef. Needless to say after multiple rounds of vomiting we went to the doctor and confirmed food poisoning. I called to complain to the manager and he said that he would process our claim through their insurance company; which doesn't really help as our claim was already processed through our insurance. I had to take time off work and we had to get sitters to help watch our child."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and the food is consistently delicious! The meals are always prepared with excellent complements, we've enjoyed everything we've had here. There is a very nice outdoor seating area and easy parking in the back. Will add Cafe 157 to our go to list."}
{"text":"I had the Cajun Penne', my wife had the Sea Bass & we shared a creme' brulee.  I couldn't have asked for better food, or service.  The presentation was nice, atmosphere was calming, modern/ classy, & Dora was a great server that was personable.  

As for the prices... Don't be stingy when it comes to good food.  I think it was very reasonable for the quality, & feel they should be charging more.  

Cheer's!"}
{"text":"Charming atmosphere and beautifully decorated.  I love to stop by after work here to meet friends for a glass of wine and appetizer. Love the cozy little bar area.  The veggie flat bread pizza rocks!  The owners Dora & George are usually there and always make me feel welcome. Nice covered patio too."}
{"text":"My husband and I always go to Cafe 157 for our anniversary; it's only been 3 years but I look forward to the food all year long. Dora was our waitress once again just like in the years before and she was awesome as usual! Our anniversary also happens to be her birthday so we always have fun chatting. This last visit, we got the fried pickles for an appetizer. They were delicious, crispy and the dipping sauce was good enough to drink through a straw. The portion could've been alittle bigger but who doesn't want more fried pickles. As for the entrees, I got the cajun penne pasta with chicken and my husband got the beef tenderloin with potatoes and asparagus. Both entrees exceeded our expectations and we didn't leave a speck on our plates. Since we were celebrating, we also indulged in dessert. I got the chocolate cake and my husband got the cheesecake. Once again, it didn't disappoint! When the check came, Dora told us that dessert was on the house since it was our anniversary. We were so shocked and appreciative. Little things like that make a difference and will continue to keep us coming back for many years to come. If you're looking for a quiet, intimate restaurant to have a nice date night or want to support small local businesses, Cafe 157 is your place!!"}
{"text":"A very nice late lunch.  Nice cozy place with a touch of class.

Quite a nice Italian menu and lots of seafood options.  I especially liked the cream sauces which is a specialty.  Service was superb and iced tea kept flowing.

A large place with plenty of room for large groups and office parties.

They also have a martini menu which would be fun to try, but not for lunch today.

Location is smack in the middle of downtown Matthews, a decent little town southeast of Charlotte.  Cute stores and they have retained the shop fronts from the past.  A nice town to stroll about on warm days.

Cafe 157 is a decent place to try out."}
{"text":"Was not crowded on a rainy Saturday evening, so we were seated immediately.  The service was very good, efficient and friendly.

I had the sea bass with risotto special.  The risotto was wonderful, the sea bass seemed just a tad undercooked, but was flavorful.  My wife had some very good crab cakes.

Overall, I'm not sure it was fully worth the slightly spendy price, but the atmosphere, service, and food combined for a pretty nice evening.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Fantastic veggie lasagne...eggplant, zucchini, tomato, onion, roasted red pepper, squash and portabello. Wonderful sauce, with cheese on a few layers, and basil. Not fried so this is a healthy, vegetarian option!! Tried the Aroncini...another favorite of mine. Crispy and light on the outside, creamy, smooth and wonderfully made inside. I love this place and how they make their dishes. Wait staff is very attentive and a pleasure. Highly recommend for a single, couple or group dinner. Lastly the limocello cake, though brought in is BRILLIANT!!!! Loved it! The creme brulee made on house is wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Great spot! Food is always good, patio is lovely, and George & Dora are always so very welcoming. Definitely a recommended place!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend last week on a Tuesday night.  We both had Gazpacho soup which was wonderful.  I had a salad and ate most of my friend's chocolate mousse cake which was amazing!  She had salmon that she enjoyed.  Service was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing! My husband and I have been twice in the past 2 weeks. Every single item we have tried is delicious, the service is second to none, and the atmosphere is perfect! We have added Cafe 157 to our list of favorites. We will be back again and again! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. We had the Arancini balls for an appetizer. I had the penne ala vodka with blackened chicken and my husband had the fish and chips. Delicious hot fresh food and great service. Matthews is a quaint town. Def worth the trip."}
{"text":"Foods was okay.  The service was great.  I am guessing the regulars don't come here for the food but for the charismatic staff.  I had a fish fish with aromatic base sauce which was tasty enough and my husbands chicken which of course I sampled was tasty too.  But I will totally be back for the lovely service.  Everyone was super friendly and in an area with a few dining options, not many, 157 will do well because of the service.  The wine selection is pretty good too.  The decor of the restaurant is a bit dated, not at all trendy but that's okay. Why put money into the building when you have an amazing team.  Give them all a raise!"}
{"text":"Our food and service were both 5 stars. Our party of 5 ordered steaks ranging from rare to medium and they were all perfect. The only reason it is a 4 is the decor. Lights dimmed and table covers would be a great change."}
{"text":"Came here for Queens Feast.  First time at Cafe 157.  Got here at 6:31 pm for a 6:30 pm reservation and was promptly told \" You're late!\"  Really not a good first impression.  I would rate service two stars and the food four stars so that's where I come up with the three star rating.  Salmon was excellent and the crab cakes were hearty.  Maybe if the service/experience improves we'll come back."}
{"text":"An absolute treasure!   This place is amazing!  A friend of mine lives closeby and recommended that we try it, so one rainy afternoon we went there and it was incredible!  The building is sort of odd(former bank), but there is street parking in front, and plenty of parking in the back.  The hostess greeted us with a smile and sat us right away.  The server was amazing, the food came out quickly, and everything was hot, fresh, and delicious.  They have a very good selection and variety of food for every taste, and you feel like you are in a place that should cost way more than it actually does to enjoy wonderful meals there.  We plan on becoming regulars!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Cafe 157, good atmosphere friendly staff. 3 out of 4 meals came out correctly. Mine was first over cooked then under cooked. Food was very good they missed the mark a little but I will be back."}
{"text":"Service was so bad we finally gave up and left. We were seated promptly,  then waited 20 minutes  to see a server. We ordered drinks and food. 15 minutes for drinks to arrive. We requested water which took another 15.  An HOUR PASSED ,  our food Never arrived."}
{"text":"Such a horrible experience...the food was horrible...the owner is a jerk...and the cops were even present when the owner started some sort of a scene outside. I would never return."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times in the past year and always receive excellent food and service. The regular menu and the specials are quite good. Our food is always served hot and together. It's a gem in the heart of Matthews."}
{"text":"My mom and I canvassed \"downtown\" for all of 5 minutes early Saturday evening for a new favorite eatery to share some Christmas cheer, but it would have to be divine food ... nothing less.  We didn't notice it was a restaurant at first but stopped in to check.  Mom requested to see the menu while still in the car ... we are quite serious about good food and accept no substitutes.  Well ... WE FOUND IT AT 157!  We are sure that you will, too.

ENJOY!  (And please provide a review )"}
{"text":"The food is so-so. They try to present themselves as a fine dining establishment but their waiting staff didn't get the memo.  Beware, the sides that come with the entrees are proportionally SMALL and if you complain, to bad, you'll have to order an additional side which is 3 to 4 times larger than what you get with the entree!  It's a shame (because their food is not bad), that they let a customer leave dissatisfied from having to pay for a $ 3.00 side unnecessarily.  The old saying, \"It's not the money, but the principle\" is fitting.  I definitely won't hurry back."}
{"text":"We haven't been to this location since it was Gado Gado, which was 3 years ago already. Oops! We decided to stop by for appetizers and a couple drinks this weekend to see how it's doing. 

The dining room was pretty slow, so I imagine you don't need a reservation. The patio looked busier and is a really nice space, weather allowing. We opted for the bar and were the only patrons on a Saturday night. The bartender was very attentive and friendly and quick with a recommendation! On Saturday nights they have $1 off their beer list (not a great selection, just bottles). 

He recommended the Arancini (I think that was the name) balls - basically hand rolled risotto and cheese balls, flash fried. These were delicious! There were 5 in the order and served with marinara. Really, if you go, get these, so good. 

We also tried the calamari, and again, I was impressed (well, not impressed with myself when I realized I was eating a fried double header, oops again). The calamari was fresh, not chewy, and there were also zucchini chips in the dish. Both appetizers were really good and made from scratch. 

I left feeling like I needed to eat a bowl of lettuce, but that was totally my fault! I'd love to go again for a full dinner - but in the meantime it's going to be on the short list for higher end appetizers!"}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch spot.  Quiet enough for good conversation   Great service.  They were flexible and allowed us to switch some things up on the menu items.  Delicious salmon cakes over greens. I would go back there just to eat the exact same thing.   Parking on the street was easy.  The staff seemed really interested in providing good service and they were personable."}
{"text":"I had the lunch salad special  with salmon patties and it was outstanding.  I wish it was on the regular menu.
Nice place, good food, friendly service,  easy parking."}
{"text":"Great relaxed bistro in the heart of DTM (downtown Matthews.)
It's a cool old converted bank building with a relaxed ambience inside.  I have come here for many a dinner, and have brought out-of-towners here.
The service is gracious, and the owner George is very kind.
Standouts include the crab cakes and shrimp and grits, and in the fall, they have the perfect butternut squash soup.
An excellent choice in Matthews!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place we just discovered for lunch. Excellent food and staff. We will positively be back here again."}
{"text":"Had dinner and dessert. AMAZING LAMB. Louis had crab cakes and loved it. Must try it out. You"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner this evening! Cafe 157 has a menu That will suit the taste of almost any customer and the prices are very reasonable.
The staff is also very friendly, and tries to accommodate any request.   Have a wonderful dinner... Even considering they were slammed for restaurant week.  Will definitely come back again..."}
{"text":"Had a nice meal here with my family.  It was very quiet, no smoking allowed outside, nicely lit outdoors, pleasant staff, nice all around atmosphere.  Pricey though, I had to stick with the burger and fries....

Best damn burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wow. We started off loving it -- our server was super friendly and personable. Really, I thought we should invite her over for a cookout. Amazing calamari appetizer. BUT we got the check and seriously almost died. Our bad for not asking price of daily specials, but, OMG... $45 for \"rack\"of lamb (undercooked and tiny). $35 for small filet of halibut (lovely).  Are you kidding me???? Most expensive item on the regular menu was filet mignon at $32. Nothing is ever more expensive than filet. The food was good but NOT worth those prices. RiDONKulous. I am so upset I will not go back. I feel taken advantage of. Could have been the start of a something great. Now, it's just another Cautionary Tale. Ask the price of off-menu specials, people!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice. Owner is complete jerk!!!!!!!!!! The menu was very limited but the Chicken Mediterranean I ordered was excellent. Then the owner came over and asked how our meal was to which I replied great. Then the owner asked to see my daughters IPad. She handed it to him. He asked me how to turn it off so I showed him. I thought he was playing a game with us.... Then he started to berate me about how my child should not be on her electronics during dinner and should engage in the meal. I thought he was kidding?!? Then he continued on and on and on and topped his insults off with telling me that I need to, and I quote, \"be the parent and make her obey me!\" I was completely shocked!!! I have never seen anyone have such poor customer service let alone tell me how to parent my child. I'm a paying customer and my daughter was certainly not disruptive to anyone. We literally had been to two other places but the wait was too long. I guess we should have waited because I'm sure the other establishments in the area would not insult me at the table. Will never go back! Guess I should have read the reviews first because it looks like I'm not the only person who's had issues with this psycho!!"}
{"text":"Such prime location in town, I always wanted to stop by and try this place. 
I have to say I'm disappointed, not only the food was average and over priced, the service was poor and the location inside is in desperate need of some updates, outside looks great, the lights and the sitting area, it really catches your eye. 
The staff looked like they hated their job, at least our waitress, except for an older gentleman that greeted us cordially a couple of times. 
Our waitress was either having a bad day or hated her job, inattentive and border line rude. Maybe the staff needs updating too. 
I ordered the special prime rib and although tasty, it was tough and full of fat, small portion for the $$
Sad to say but I doubt we will be going back."}
{"text":"So I had such a great experience the first time, I decided it was time to head back to Cafe 157 for dinner.  Oh well :(

To start, the service was REALLY slow.  I mean starting to wonder if the cook went home slow.  They weren't packed: 3 inside tables and a handful outside so I can't figure out why except they're short staffed.  The wait staff wasn't a help either with our drink glasses sitting empty until someone notice we were dying of thirst. 

The food wasn't great either.  I had the fish and chips which isn't a hard dish and considering it was $16, I figured it had to be good.  Strike 2: the batter was soft and they didn't put the fish over the chips so the batter got worse over time.  

Finally, the check was stupid expensive for what we ordered - Strike 3.  

During the time I was waiting for my food, it came to me that the problem with this place is that it doesn't know what it wants to be.  Everything it served up like you'd find in a white-linen restaurant  upscale restaurant (condiments served in small cups, expensive menu, upscale menu items).  But the music is a mix of loud rock hits (Sweet Child of Mine played at one point), the tables and booths are lower rent and the service is SLOW.  

I really really really wanted to like this place after my first experience was so positive but unfortunately it was not to be.  The good news is that their patio is still awesome so maybe eat elsewhere and have drinks and deserts on the patio."}
{"text":"Went there for Christmas dinner with our special needs son. The manager was cordial and engaging. Especially with our son. The food was excellent as was our server. The pork medallions with the onion reduction sauce was super. The mash potatoes were just average. My iced tea never went below half full before a refill. My son ate the fried chicken meal and completely cleaned his plate.  We both had the wedge salad. Remarkably like Outback Steakhouses' . An enjoyable evening for a Christmas away from home."}
{"text":"Cafe 157 continues to be our favorite restaurant in the area      they are very accommodating and the food is fantastic no matter what we order"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely loved this place. The food was amazing and the waitress was Johnny on the spot. She didn't miss a beat.  We both ordered the specials, my husband the Surf and Turf and me the scallops. For starters we had martinis and the risotto balls. Everything was delicious. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, wonderful staff! My daughter took us for Mother's Day and it was really good! The kids had eggs Benedict for the first time, I had the short rib and polenta. The desserts, salad and soup were also very good."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. Not worth the price! Burger had no taste and my friends Alfredo was drenched in oil. Was a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"While the ambience may leave a bit to be deaired, the food makes up for it!!!  The calamari was the most tender I have ever had, with a delicious lemon aioli. The fig and prosciutto flat bread was also exvellent, and large. The bread basket was a tender inside, crispy crust brioche with olive oil, herbs and parmesan cheese cooked into it. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Ok this is a great location with average food. If you want to sit outside in picturesque downtown Matthews, people watch and absorb the atmosphere-this spot is highly recommended. Sit at an outdoor table with one of the few apps they offer and enjoy a glass of wine. 

Parking on street-busy Trade Street area."}
{"text":"Today was my third visit to Cafe 157. The previous two visits were good -- the food is usually tasty. Today, I went for lunch at 1 p.m. with a colleague. The food was good but I was TERRIBLY disgusted by the tall female server with the long, blonde hair who came to the table with a visible runny nose (left nostril, to be exact, and I know this because I could see it as she stood over my guest and I asking for our drink orders), which she wiped with the back of her hand. I would have made a complaint to the management on the spot but I figured they were already aware that she was VISIBLY SICK with a runny nose and cough (and she audibly coughed while serving other customers) and allowed her to work anyway that my complaint wouldn't have made a difference, so I decided to vent my frustration this way. With her contaminated hands she touched my unwrapped straw and the limes that garnished my drink. I also watched her sit in the back of the restaurant and roll silverware into napkins while coughing with an uncovered mouth. TOTALLY DISGUSTING!!! This says a lot about how seriously the restaurant management takes the health and protection of its diners."}
{"text":"As always George & staff are superb. Attention to detail & caring. We go there only on special occasions so as to enjoy the grand treatment.  Cafe 131 does use the farmer's market across the street. A huge +!!"}
{"text":"This review is not about the food, which was good.....our server on the other hand was mediocre at best,and should not be in the Restaurant business.
Wanting to take plates when we weren't finished, to then asking,
'Are you finished now!' two minutes later in a somewhat surly manner! 
When you are talking about how bad the service is during the meal it doesn't add up to having the best dining experience!"}
{"text":"Corvina fish on a bed of couscous. Just an amazing fish that melts in your mouth. I can't say enough about the relaxing atmosphere of sitting out on the porch while enjoying this 3 course meal which started with an amazing Caesar salad and ended with a true New York style cheesecake."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place. Food is always amazing. The owner hand picks all of his fish and steaks weekly. Very high quality. He takes his time coming around talking with every table. The patio is so pretty. We had the lamb chop special, out of this world cooked perfectly. Also had the vegetable \"lasagna\" with zucchini and eggplant layers. Creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. Service always so good. A Matthews gem."}
{"text":"Service was okay, prices were reasonable and food was okay. We had spinach dip as an appetizer and it was pretty good. I had lemonade to drink and it was very good. We also had cheese burgers with fried and a side of potato salad. The burgers were okay nothing special, fries were fries and the potato salad had a weird taste in my opinion. If I am near the Matthews area I might stop by, however I will not make a special trip."}
{"text":"We had s very nice time at Cafe157!!
The food and service were very good. We were happy to meet one of the owners and Dora was exceptionally friendly and gracious. We really felt at home. 
The atmosphere of a former bank turned into a great al fresco restaurant is comparable with any in Providence or Boston!!
Looking forward to a return visit before we leave Matthews!!!"}

I came here for lunch last weekend and enjoyed it very much.

The atmosphere is nice, clean and modern.  I almost felt a little under-dressed considering I was wearing running pants and a sweatshirt but oh well.  The servers were very friendly the lunch menu offered a good variety.

I ordered a salad that had a thin-sliced of grilled chicken breast on top...it had goat cheese, cranberries, pecans, etc.  It was very just enough of everything and the dressing was a nice vinaigrette that added just enough flavor to the meal.

I also tried the butternut squash soup and that was good.  It was everything it should have been, creamy, comforting, a little sweet but also savoring.  It was very good.

The man ordered a burger that came with applewood smoked bacon and fries on the side.  The burgers are made to order and very fresh.  It was a good burger!  I was surprised but it was juicy and hearty.  Well done.

My ONLY gripe is that I think they are a little overpriced...especially their lunch menu.  My salad ended up being nearly $13 and really there wasn't much to it.  We walked out of there spending what we normally would for dinner.  I think it is perfect for a nicer lunch with family or friends but to just stop in for a quick bite...you leave feeling a tad bit merked.  

All in all I like this place.  Matthews isn't offering a whole lot these days so I am glad to have Cafe 157 as an option."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends. Rich ice cream, friendly staff and really nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for a few years, and have to say things have improved! A great location with excellent outdoor seating that can't be beat, and friendly very involved owners. Dora is great! The past two times I've had fish dishes and they were excellent. Great martinis as well. A very good spot for dinner in Matthews or just drinks! I'll be back more often."}
{"text":"Let me first say, restaurant was not busy as it should've been because the food was absolutely delicious. The owner Who is very cordial and polite came out and personally introduced him self. My wife and I had the calamari which was tender and crispy. I started off with the red beet salad which was just absolutely spot on and I finished with the scallops which were done perfectly. 
I totally recommend this place for the food service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went on Friday with my wife for lunch. She had the rueben sandwich and it was very good. I tried the cobb salad, and although it was pretty good, it was WAY overpriced. When I saw a $10 salad, I was expecting a pretty decent meal. I got a pretty expensive side salad instead. For that reason, they are chopped."}
