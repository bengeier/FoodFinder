{"text":"Came across this place because I saw the grand opening sign when I was in the area. I been craving Filipino food since I moved to Vegas and thought I'd give it a try. The customer service was excellent and the owners were very friendly. The food was delicious and hit the spot. So many different food options and I love how they make it fresh. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"2nd time coming to this location. first time we came on a sunday around 7 pm, on yelp it says they are open till 8pm but was already closed. handwritten sign on door says they close at 6 on sundays.  ok, not a big deal. came today to try the food.  sunday at around 12:30 pm.  door closed.  with closed sign. no note or anything to indicate if they will open at all today. i dont think im coming back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at ISLA GRILL. Food was jam packed with flavor and taste. I had to turn my Tosilog in to the chef because I wanted it to have more crunch. Nonetheless I enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant for the first time and everything we ordered were good. All the \"silogs\" we're really yummy! Sisig and BBQ were also very good. Will definitely be a regular customer and will be our go to place for good Filipino food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cuisines has to be Filipino food. As a long time fan and an adopted brother to a Filipino sister I have to say that I was extremely impressed by everything we tried. The owners were great and helped me pronounce something that I have been saying wrong for years apparently haha. I would definitely try the always classic Lumpia!! It is a winner for sure."}
{"text":"Food is good BUT they have to set their hours according to customers instead of theirs. It seems like they can close the restaurant whenever they want to. On yelp it says it's open but when I went there, the sign says it was closed. And this is not the first time that it happened. So unprofessional and bad reputation. I've been waiting for this restaurant to open, now that it is, they can open whenever they want to. I guess they really don't need the business."}
{"text":"Came upon this place as I was on my way home. My belly was beckoning some warm soup as it was a chilly night. I walked in to see the friendly cashier stalking up on coconut juice and immediately ordered a can. I ordered tapsilog and their specialty soup. Everything was prepared fresh and made to order.   I shall return. Hope he keeps his promise and has my favorite soap opera playing on my next visit."}
{"text":"Im surely comeback. I love the batchoy soup. And its cheaper great service.. very nice place its clean also.."}
{"text":"They say they deliver but phone listed says it is temporarily not in service.  how do we order food for delivery then. Am sick at the moment and Would have loved to try the food, especially the sinigang and the pork bbq and java rice"}
{"text":"Sad this place didn't last very long. I came for the breakfast and opened the door and it's completely empty. Doors unlocked and nothing inside. I guess they forgot to lock up or didn't care to."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have an awesome Filipino joint down the street from me. You betta come hungry because their serving's pretty big - and pretty cheap! My boyfriend and I got breakfast and it was perfect. 2 scoops of rice + 2 eggs & FREE coffee!! The owners (?) were freaking awesome, so nice and so welcoming. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has good food! The best sizzler plates, especially, Sizzling sisig! And they have La Paz Batchoy, although I'm not a fan, but my husband loves it! It's just that their location is not great, wherein people would notice their restaurant. It's newly opened so it needs to be advertised more. Otherwise, great food, very clean, and the owners are very welcoming"}
{"text":"Based on my experience, I'll have to give 2-stars. However, I definitely want to give them another chance and plan on visiting in a few weeks from now in hopes that things have improved in it's efficiency.  From the quick encounter, I can see that the owner is genuinely a nice person, so I definitely want to see Isla Grille succeed.  Between this restaurant and the one next door, my husband and I made the decision to dine at Isla as we could see that we could get a quick meal from the outside as they already had food out in trays as we are accustomed to when visiting an establishment like Panda Express. Upon ordering, the counter worker proceeded to write down our order which I thought was odd, but okay.  For my order, I asked for half rice and half pancit. Per the counter person, they charge $1 for half-n-half. No problem, I'll pay it.   In all fairness to the company, it was 6pm and dinner time, therefore, they were busy with taking phone orders. However, I still expect outstanding service, especially when it matters the most, during peak hours.  I paid for mines and my husband's meal. For drinks, as I saw they had a water dispenser, I told the counter help that we would just have waters. While swiping my card, the POS errored out. So once the system was cleared, I swiped my card again. When I sat down and reviewed my receipt, my husband was just placing the cups of water he got from the dispenser. Unfortunately, the receipt indicated that I was charged for two water bottles...ugh!  I returned to the counter and asked for a refund as I didn't realize they had bottled water and that the intention was to dispense our own water. The counter person sincerely apologized and attempted to figure out how to do a refund. She also asked the owner to which he also didn't know how to do a refund. And honestly, I get it because I work for a software company and I have helped many clients with having to do refunds and for some reason, it just isn't an easy task to complete. So because it didn't appear that anyone knew how to do a refund, I just took the bottled water.  So after waiting for sometime, the counter help asked from the counter, \"DO YOU WANT WHITE RICE OR GARLIC RICE!?\"  I didn't even know that garlic rice was an option, so my husband and I got garlic rice. When our order finally arrived, guess what? I got all garlic rice. I looked at my receipt and could see that I was not charged for the half pancit. So this is the problem right? The food was already in trays at the counter, had the order been filled instead of written down, my husband and I wouldn't have had to wait and my order would have been correct the first time.   My husband ordered the dinaguan (pork cooked in pork blood) and chicken adobo. He loved both. I for one will not eat dinaguan, so I'll take my husband's word. But the chicken adobo was good. I ordered the beef dish that was very good and to be different, I also got the sweet sour fish. Well, the fish was very hard. Hoping for a good experience, I attempted to eat three of the sweet sour fish to no avail. When the counter help came by to ask how we were doing and if she could take anything, I did mention to her about the fish. She did apologize but also added that because they have to keep it at a certain temperature, the heat probably dried it out. Honestly, I didn't expect a refund for the fish because they don't know how to give a refund.  Two days later, guess what? That POS error, I was charged twice! Because Isla did not know how to refund me, I called the bank to appeal the charge and it was promptly reversed.   So with so many filipino restaurants in the vicinity, and if you're following me, you'll see that I've been to many, it's obvious that no two filipino restaurant is the same. Keep in mind that the Phillipines is made up of several islands and so the cuisine differs from the north, south and in between. This is true of Isla. So much so that their pancit even looks different from what I'm accustomed to. One of the dishes that was extremely popular the night of my visit was their soup, Batchoy, a dish I've never heard of. And because of this, I do plan to try it.  So with so many issues I encountered with Isla, I'm not mad, just disappointed and yet hopeful. There is definitely a great opportunity to improve and I would love to see Isla succeed. I'll be back in a few weeks and I'm hoping I can update this 2-star rating to 5-star."}
{"text":"First time in this place. Noticed sewer smell coming from next door. Lost my appetit. Complained about it. Ordered fresh lumpia it's very salty & inside the wrapper is only sweet potato/carrots & romaine lettuce. Never ever coming back here again. The bbq pork/chicken skewer  & java rice r good."}
{"text":"Best food in town love Filipino food. There chef is one of the best I decided to come and try excellent launch feel like homemade food. Make sure you try chicken inasal . Such a great customer service I will recommend them to my Friends and family............."}
{"text":"Nice owners with selection of Tapsilog, Bangusilog, longansilog even spamsilog...had the BBQ pork with garlic rice and a cup of the Batchoy soup. I'm glad there's something close for my comfort food!"}
{"text":"Great service from the staff. The breakfast menu is cheaper than other places and the portion is pretty much the same. They actually give you 2 scoops of rice and 2 eggs. The sizzling sisig was great. The palabok tastes pretty good too but I personally think it needs sahog (meat or fish). They just recently opened up. I wish them more success. I can't wait to visit again and try the other dishes they have."}
{"text":"New spot that opened by my house. Noticed it when I went to get sushi across from them the other day. I ordered the tapsilog, which is garlic rice, some sort of beef and with eggs. It was delicious! The flavor mix of the beef with everything was amazing. I live close, so I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this place to open since we saw the sign facing ft apache. Finally was able to go in and order, we were the first ones in today. They were all so nice. I ordered the Bangusilog - and for $5.99 that's a great deal. Especially after seeing the portion you get. Now for bangus, it's really hard to get it right because it can either be too crispy or too rubbery. So I took the chance with it because I really wanted bangus lol. We took the food to go and when I got home I was surprised at how much food you got for $5.99-- took a bite of the bangus- and man, that was THE BEST bangus I have ever had! The crisp was perfect, it wasn't over cooked or under cooked. It was amazing! The eggs, were also a perfect over medium, and the garlic rice was so good, the garlic was not over powering at all.   All in all the service was great, and the food was amazing! Definitely coming back to try their lunch! :)"}
{"text":"Pro: Staff was really cool.  Cons: The food.  We ordered two bangsilogs, a batchoy and a three item combo.  They were really salty and it took them almost an hour to get it to me.    They're new so hopefully this is part of the learning."}
{"text":"Excited this place is open. Saw the balloons out front of the restaurant.  Bright, fresh decor with some rustic touches like slate and exposed wood make this place feel more homey than a typical quick serve, strip mall, restaurant.  The owners were super friendly.   Lots of menu options - breakfast, lunch, and catering.  Great portion size on the pancit bihon - fresh and not greesy like it can be. Oh so yummy. They even made my girl her favorite, pinak bet, even though it wasn't on the menu. Mini-lumpia melt in your mouth.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"The best filipino restaurant in Vegas. Highly recommended. Excellent food taste in affordable price."}
