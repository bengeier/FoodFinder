{"text":"Cheater coffee shop. I went with my niece to this place because she wanted a bubble tea drink. It was average. The reason that I made this review is my observation of how another customer was treated. One the menu there was preserved mango and fresh mango bubble drink The lady ordered fresh mango bubble tea. When the tea was done, the lady customer noticed that it was not fresh mango bubble tea. She brought this to the owner/server's attention. Guess what the owner said in a loud arrogant voice. \"It is the same. If I had fresh mango bubble tea I would have made it for you ! But I don't have it ! Just try the preserved one I made and it is good !\" The nerve of this owner. The lady customer said she wanted fresh mango and that is why she ordered fresh mango. She is right. The owner/server is definitely wrong and arrogant ! The nerve of some people ! The lady customer then said she was charged for fresh bubble tea and got preserved mango bubble tea. This is not right at all. The owner again said in a loud voice \"It is the same price!\" How can fresh and preserved be the same price. Even a teenager knows it is not ! The owner does not even have the decency to understand that when her customers order something because they want something ! If it is not available can she just change the order?? One of a kind joint ! The lady customer then said she will not go back and she is right. I would not go back to this joint either ! Further to this the owner/server sat down to chat with her friend loudly like in any asian restaurant. No ambience at all ! This should be better brought to the attention of the Better Business Bureau of Canada !"}

{"text":"I don't know how to make a Cappuccino myself... but I drink enough to know what a good one tasted like.. or how it suppose to be made... 

I. C. Coffee House is the worst one I ever drank... even from home baristas... and he supposed to charge people money for that?? 

Espresso was off!! It was like drip coffee...so watery... 
Milk was not steamed hot enough to produce any milk foam (advice get a temperature gauge) the barely hot milk does not have any texture and have no firm foam... 

I was basically drinking a drip coffee with some light foam on top....... 

I need to go to Indie coffee shops downtown to have my espresso fix NOW!!

Why there is NO WHERE to get something half decent in the area!

No only the drink suck, the environment is not comfy... though they do have free WIFI...  

I might have to stick with Starbucks when I am up in Markham.. at least I know what to expect!"}
