{"text":"I have gotten take out for a couple of times since then and havent been disappointed again. Service is quick and corteous."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here several times and tonight was my first time coming in person. The food is amazing, we had the spicy peanut tofu, chicken spring rolls, and wonton soup. Everything was delicious and the service was fast and friendly. The prices were very reasonable and the restaurant was incredibly  clean and quiet. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"C'est Bon?  Well, it's good... SOME of the time, but when it's bad, it's BAD!  We got  an order of chicken fried rice and an order of general tao chicken for take out.  The bad: Chicken fried rice: we ordered small and it was more than enough for two people! But nothing special, mostly bland and the frozen peas they had thrown in there were not even fully cooked.  The good: General tao chicken: This dish, on the contrary, was fantastic! Slices of chicken breast, cooked to perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, glazed with this amazing sweet, tangy, and spicy general tao sauce!  And again, generous portion size!  I would definitely recommend the General tao chicken, which, not surprisingly, happens to be their speciality dish, but I'm skeptical of other dishes at this location.   Food: B+ Service: N/A Food presentation: B+ Atmosphere:N/A Prices: B+ Recommended?: Yes?"}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I purchased takeout of the Mixed Veggies, Salt and Pepper Squid, and Shrimp Egg Rolls for me and my friends today for lunch, October 6th, 2015. The order was supposed to feed 3 people, and it was portioned for 1 person only. But that wasn't the only problem with our order,  our food was spoiled. The vegetable order was spoiled with black mold growing on the vegetables. The squid was tasting spoiled too. This was my first and last time I'm ordering from C'est Bon ever again. And what really grossed me out about this place was that while I was waiting to speak to management, another customer called in to let them know that their order was spoiled as well. Customers beware! Not worth it, go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"It's the best Chinese food, for real. We always get the crispy ginger beef, general Tao chicken. I also like the honey garlic ribs and the basil chicken. I like the wonton soup and my partner likes the hot and sour soup, it's very peppery. If you live in the neighbourhood this will become your go to for Chinese."}
{"text":"What a dump.  We ordered, they confirmed delivery within the hour, after 90 minutes, we called and they said the order would be there within 5 minutes and 60 minutes later,no order.  We called back only to be lied to again.   Once the order arrived after 2.5 hours later, we called the restaurant and got nothing but attitude and bullshit.  Never, ever again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Dinner for Two this evening, on a whim because neither of us wanted to cook, and have to say that we made the right choice! The food was awesome... GREAT chicken wings with a little peppery kick, chicken chop suey was fresh and perfectly cooked (ie. not soggy and droppy, like too many places!), chicken balls with real chicken pieces, fried rice with many veggie, chicken, and egg pieces... we drove right through Chinatown on our way home from work, and decided on C'est Bon for a more \"Canadian\" version of chinese food (having grown up in northeast Ontario, I have the craving from time to time - no judgment!). AND the price was right under $30 for our takeout, where we would have otherwise been we would have easily paid over $60 for two at the local Mandarin. No regrets - I'll definitely be checking out their more authentic dishes the next time!"}
{"text":"C'est Bon means \"It's good\" in French. Personally, I think this place is more than good, it's awesome!  C'est Bon is a Chinese restaurant that offers not only Chinese food but Thai and some Japanese cuisine as well. The restaurant is small, cozy, warm looking, very clean and has very friendly staff who provide excellent service. I love the look of their dark furniture, beautiful Asian d√©cor and calm atmosphere.   The menu consists of: appetizers, dim sum (steamed & pan-fried), soup that include spicy Thai soup & chicken wonton. They also have fish, crispy duck, a variety of rice and noodle dishes, sweet & sour, chop suey, vegetarian meals, manchu & szechuan dishes, C'est Bon 'all time favourite' options that include General Tsao chicken & shrimps in lobster sauce etc. This is just to give you an idea; there are tons of other dishes.  I've tried plenty of their dishes and I've been happy with all of them. My personal favourites have to be the general tsao tofu ($9.95), orange chicken ($10.50) and szechuan chicken noodles ($10.50). The food here is not oily or salty like you may find in other Chinese restaurants. Everything is cooked perfectly, the food quality is great and the dishes are presented very nicely. The portions are good and the prices here are very reasonable too. Besides the gigantic dinner menu, they also have a great inexpensive lunch menu.  Overall, C'est Bon is a great pan-Asian restaurant.  I would recommend making reservations if you're planning to go in the evening since this place is small and can fill up pretty fast. Don't forget to order the ice-cream for dessert; they take it too the next level here. I ordered vanilla ice-cream and it was presented to me in a cocktail glass goblet full of ice-cream drizzled with gooey caramel and strawberry sauce and dusted with cinnamon! This is a perfect way to end any meal."}
{"text":"After trying out the other C'est Bon location and loving it, I decided to check this location out with friends. This C'est Bon has a free parking lot in front of the restaurant which is convenient for those driving in.  The place looks somewhat unattractive from the outside but it's not too bad inside. The interior is rather small, casual and quiet. I right away realized that I liked the other location better as it was more alive and trendy in comparison.  The food at C'est Bon is excellent! Reasonably priced, the menu offers a wide variety of Asian dishes, the portions are good, and the food is very yummy. My group shared a bunch of dishes and my favorites have to the spicy peanut tofu ($9.95), satay chicken ($10.50), hot and sour soup ($3.25) and more. The food is hot, fresh, flavorful and filling.The service here was really good too- friendly and efficient.  C'est Bon is a great Pan-Asian restaurant with tons of yummy and reasonably priced options. Personally I rather dine at the other location south of Yonge and Eglinton since that location is more pleasing to the eye."}
{"text":"The American-style Chinese food here is super tasty! I actually don't order the takeout, instead we dine in because it's small/quiet/intimate and NEVER busy.  Which makes me sad, because I really like this place and don't want it to go out of business. The chicken balls are good as is the basil chicken.  They pretty much have everything on the menu ... but it can get pricey if you don't pay attention to what you're ordering. I would keep it to 3-4 plates max if you want to keep the price down.  Each plate can feed 3 easily."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great service. Noticeably fresh ingredients. The flavors just jump off the plate.The spicy dry cooked beans are amazing. The garlic eggplant is terrific. And the ginger chicken, mentioned by another reviewer, is so sweet it should be served for dessert. The prices are not the cheapest (nor the most expensive) but you get what you pay for here. Oh, and ice-cold Tsing Tao is only $5 a bottle so at least you don't get extorted on the beverage side of the menu. The restaurant itself is always empty and I have no idea why except that it seems everyone in the neighbourhood orders delivery - go there around 7pm and the phone doesn't stop ringing. Service is friendly and fast. Decor is not trendy or upscale but it's clean, white tablecloths, etc. And you'll have to ask for chopsticks (that's the mangiacake clientele, not an indication of the food or restaurant's philosophy). Best chinese in midtown by a  wide margin."}
{"text":"Walked into this place on a quiet Tuesday afternoon after the lunch rush. They were hardly any people. The service was prompt and we had our selection of tables. It was an average meal and nothing about the food stood out. The hot and sour soup was thick and served immediately. We also ordered some vegetarian dumplings which were rather undercooked. Finally the Cantonese chowmein was oily and not particularly tasty. Overall, it was not a satisfactory meal."}
{"text":"Have lunch here.  Great value and pretty tasty.it doesn't pretend to be gourmet. Just a good local joint. Order in food is hot and generous."}
{"text":"Horrendous. I tried C'est Bon tonight---my first Chinese food experience since moving to Toronto earlier this month. First off, the prices are high. They charge almost $4 for a side of rice barely enough for two people. Every other Chinese place I've ever been to gives you rice FOR FREE with an entree. We had two entrees delivered along with dumplings and a soup. The hot and sour soup was entirely too peppery and a weird shade of orange. The sweet and sour pork lacked flavor and their house specialty chicken was bits of chicken breaded and soggy in a dry seasoning, no sauce. Very strange. Both entress had the exact same misc. vegetables, no variety. The steamed pork dumplings were OK, mind you they were $10 for 8. We will never order from here again. Lackluster, overpriced food. Ick."}
{"text":"Tasty food, delivered quickly, no msg, chicken spring rolls and crispy beef are favourite items."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a lot. The most recent time I noticed my portion of noodles was a lot smaller than usual - about 60% what it usually is! I called the restaurant and they said portion sizes have gone down due to their costs. They were unwilling to do anything for me despite being a frequent customer. Also, the guy who delivers is super sullen and once got pissed off at me for ordering via JustEat. I'll take my money elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off since they took over the fish and chip by the same name, and the had the slogan \"more than just fish and chips\"  It was fine back then, when there were no nearby options, but now this place has got to up it's game.  The demographic that goes nuts for egg rolls and chop suey is fading quickly.   The average midtowner knows of at least one of the Congee Queen, Time, King, Star places that are much much better.   Or, if the place is still Taiwanese owned, how about rocking a real Taiwanese menu, instead of a mish-mash of mostly fake Chinese food?  I gave 2 stars. One for each dish they do well. Crispy Ginger Chicken. When done well, it's crispy, caramelized, sweet, and savoury. When done poorly it's a salty, soggy, mess.  Can't tell if it is different chefs, or just an inconsistent one.   The other dish is the basil chicken, which like the above is great when they do it well.   Typically, I don't deviate from these 2 dishes, but each time I do I am met with disappointment.  Recently I got the chow mein that was full on soggy. Totally unacceptable these days.    If any of the employees that might read this, ask yourself honestly - how many of the dishes on the menu would you say are authentic? How many of them would you order of you were a customer? Yea, thought so....."}
{"text":"Do not waste your coin on this place! The food is very BLAND,ordered garlic baby bok Choy.....no garlic,Shrimp lo mein no flavor,mancho beef was ok all you taste is the heat. Egg roll was good,spring roll ok. DO NOt waste your money head down to. Rol San Spadina and College"}
{"text":"Sometimes this is great lunch spot, but seems to be on a downward spiral.  Over cooked sticky rice, spring rolls frozen in the centre, and burned tofu...  Too bad, as was a regular there for the past 5 years.  What happened?"}
{"text":"Meh Over priced somewhat authentic Chinese food. Smallest portions i have ever seen for Chinese food.  The French name and non-Asian clientelle tell it all. Not the best Chinese food you'll eat.  Save your money and go to Dundas."}
{"text":"Bland. Everything tasted the exact same. The Pad Thai had no flavor. The egg roll wasn't authentic. And the sesame chicken was dry and far too sweet. I will never revisit."}
{"text":"Chinese place with a French name? Pretentious, or just stupid? Sweet and sour fish was mushy as hell while the broccoli was raw. the whole dish smelled funny, like freezer burned, same with the hot and sour soup, and the steamed rice. Sesame chicken was hilarious. I think they used a whole bag of sesame seeds. Completely covered in sesame....couldn't taste anything but sesame."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Chinese food and I generally like most of dishes. I really couldn't finish the hot and sour soup. It was not hot or sour, just with chunks of black pepper which occasionally cracked under my teeth and made it spicyish.   The meat was overly salty and had to be digested with a ton of rice and water. I wasn't a fan of the spring rolls either, which is really hard to dislike.  The only good things were really the service and the carrot and the cabbage on the side. There are just too many good places to eat nearby....."}
{"text":"Love this place, been going here for years, they have a wonderful vegetarian selection aswell"}
{"text":"Had General Tsao chicken here for the first time. The service wasn't particularly friendly and it felt like a long time to wait for my food (keep in mind I was one of the only people there). At least my drink was cold? The food was decent. I've certainly had better though. The decor in the building looks cheap and artificial. They really should repaint that roof. It looks ghastly and unkempt.  If I'm ever in the area, I might consider trying this place out one more time but then again, why even bother? I'd be better off with the Subway next door..."}
{"text":"Placed order at 6:31.  Told it would be delivered at 7:20.  Called to find out where it was at 7:50 as it was well over the 50 minutes.  They could not tell me where my order was.  Called again at 8:10.  This time they said they would call the driver.  Order showed up at 8:22.  Food was barely warm and the sauce for sweet and sour chicken was not packed with order.  Very disappointing.  Life is short; misery is optional.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"Extremely rude customer service when taking a delivery order. The lady was very impatient, impolite and snappy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! As a vegetarian, it's always hard to find places that will accommodate you AND be delicious, but C'est Bon does it so well! Their General Tao Tofu is definitely amongst the best things I've ever eaten!  The egg rolls are also awesome, and the Shanghai Noodles (no meat of course!) My spouse is in love with their Chow Mein, and I wish we were a more adventuours couple so we could try out the rest of their menu.   On top of the delicious factor, their delivery is always *crazy* quick (maybe due to the fact we live 10 minutes down the road...) but we got 4 egg rolls, 2 large General Tao Tofus and 2 large orders of Rice withing 15 minutes of calling once and it was fantatsic!  Their eat in is unfortunately not so great though. Since so many people order out, the one waitress in charge of their 6 tables pretty much swarmed us the entire night, and was almost willing to spoon feed us our meals. If you want to really enjoy the fine cusine at C'est Bon, order out, do not eat in!!"}
{"text":"I occasionally come here for lunch, until yesterday, i have decided i cannot ever come back to eat again.  I asked the server if there was anything with soup and noodles, the lady gave me a choice of pork or chicken.  I chose chicken. The lady then brought me noodles in soup with sliced chicken. After i had a couple of bites, the lady asked how was the food as they have never served this before.   Everything was ok until when i got back to work, i began to get cold sweats, then began to vomit. I got sick from the noodles.   Unfortunately, I don't think i will risk to come back again."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place for many years now, and I must say, their food is great and delivered fast and piping hot. I love General Tao Chicken, but it's hard to find a place that makes it the right way. And they do!! Their portion sizes are generous and the quality is spot on. They have a great menu with everything you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. I have never been disappointed with this place and highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This is location is my neighborhood's Chinese restaurant. I've been a repeat customer of theirs. It's unfortunate that they are unable to take any feedback.   Upon calling to reorder another item, because my first item wasn't good ... I was told that's \"how it's supposed to be\".  With other options out there they've lost my business. It's quite unfortunate that after remodeling their interior, they're unwilling to even hear feedback.    There are options north of Lawrence that offer much better value and quality."}
{"text":"This place doesn't get everything right, but when they do, it's amazing!  The fried chicken wings and B.B.Q. pork spareribs are fantastic. I love the sweet & sour chicken with pineapple, crispy ginger beef, c'est bon spicy cicken and beef with broccoli. The ingredients are super fresh and they use quality cuts of beef and chicken breast.   Avoid the noodles, which are disappointing, and go for the fried rice. It's great and comes in two sizes. My personal favourite is the B.B.Q pork.  It wouldn't be a review without mentioning the deep fried Mars bar. It's normally amazing but the last two times I ordered, it was rather greasy. So, proceed with caution.   In addition to the noodles, I would stay away from the beef in black pepper sauce and dumplings. They are a swing and a miss. Also, the sesame chicken is so candy-like in texture it nearly pulled out a filling. I would not recommend it for anyone with dental work or loose teeth. The spring rolls are meh.   This isn't the chinese I grew up eating but it is the best I've found in midtown."}
{"text":"So tasty, when I lived in that neighborhood I usually had some general tao chicken, and some ridiculously spicy fried rice, and I was never disappointed."}
{"text":"First time trying this chain. Ordered a vegetarian combo for lunch and I was very happy with the portion size and taste. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The annual Jewish tradition is Chinese food on Christmas. Any half way decent Chinese place should be rammed to the gills with Bubi's and the collected Mishbuka(sic?), desperate to get their nosh on.           The fact that C'est Bon was a quarter full on Christmas Day should have been our first warning sign.  The  inclusion of only forks and no chopsticks should have been another. I have nothing against American Chinese food and its important contributions to North American food (see General Taio, Chop Suez, Chicken balls... the list goes on), but it has to be done well, which means an that some things on the menu that aren't completely bland and \"westernized\" I had the large chicken Lo Mein. The meat was meh, the sauce was meh and the portion was huge. Sigh.            This may have passed muster with an older generation but I hope that most younger food inclined people in Toronto have at least been to a few spots in Chinatown or to the great Chinese Cuisine heartlands in Markham and points north, You can also get half decent noodles at all the generic pan-Asian places uptown. (Hello Spring Roles!) There is so much more to Chinese food than big portions of badly sauced noodles and boring veggies. Ces't Bon Bills itself as authentic but its just not done well."}
{"text":"This is a very good Canadian-Chinese food establishment.   I would give it 3.5 stars if that option was available.   Not a destination place, but definitely an option to try if in the area.    I think their main business is take-out, as the dining room is quite small.   They have good lunch specials during the week; I don't know if these specials are available on week-ends."}
{"text":"This place has the classics and its good food.  I'd recommend it for a quick take out fix if that's what you are looking for.  in fact, it's perfect for that.  If you are looking for something more authentic or a wider range of items you will have to look eslewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every vegetarian dish from them is amazing especially the peanut tofu and spicy eggplant. Spring rolls were perfect,  not oily at all. Really fast delivery time too. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"What was I smoking the night I gave them five stars.  The only real good thing here is the General Tsao's Chicken.  The search continues."}
{"text":"I have had the experience of both dining in and having my meal delivered to my home. The name of the place includes the word, \"authentic.\" I don't think I've ever had authentic Chinese food prior to going to C'est Bon so I'll have to take their word for it. Mind you, on the menu you will find the American classics like 'Chicken Balls' and 'General Tao Chicken.'   As mentioned by Joy S., the portions are quite big. I would recommend you eat at C'est Bon with an empty stomach.   Service is excellent. Staff is friendly and efficient. If dining it, you want to call ahead of time as seating is quite limited. If you decide to order delivery or take-out, then seating shouldn't affect you in any way.   The menu is quite extensive so you're overwhelmed with choices. Each section of the menu is divided up into categories [i.e. rice, poultry, vegetables] so make sure that you have an idea of what you're jonesing to eat. If not, you might take a very long time deciding what to eat... which may lead to you annoying your dining companions... which in turn might have you lose the privilege of dining with said companions. You can always take the easier route of ordering the 'Dinner for 2' or 'Dinner for 3' combinations.... that always works too.   The food is pretty good and I recommend everything on the menu; you wont feel queasy after eating it. Definitely try the Fried Mars Bar as a dessert. I don't want to know the calorie count or the fat content, but... it's really good! You have a Mars Bar in a Spring Roll shell.   For the last few times that we were patrons of C'est Bon, we have had delivery. The fastest time it took for our food to arrive was 30 minutes and the slowest was 45 minutes. Unfortunately if you don't live within their boundaries, delivery may not be an option.   Yay, I am a fan."}
{"text":"I've only been here once. I was on my way to the theatre when my SO and I decided to grab a bite beforehand. Walking along Yonge, we see C'est Bon and decided to try it out. We were greeted and seated immediately. It's a cozy little restaurant and there seemed to be a lot of regulars/loyal customers. The d√©cor was interesting to look at and the menu was really extensive. The service here was great, really quick and helpful, and they were really friendly.   My SO ordered Peanut Chicken and I ordered one of their signature dishes - I think it was called the C'est Bon black bean basil with Chinese eggplant? I think it's supposed to come with little bits of chicken as well, but there wasn't a lot in the dish when it came. This didn't bother me though. It was tasty, but a little too oily and salty for me. I had to portion it with a large amount of rice. My SO really liked the dish he had though.   The downside is that you have to order rice separately, it's not too expensive, but I suggest getting the Large size because the serving plates are generous depending on what you order.   Overall, I had a nice experience and the people that served us were incredibly kind. If I'm ever in the area, I might go back, but will probably order something else."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout at least 3-4 other times.  Today I called and not only had the most lifeless person take my order, but finally after struggling to ask for two veggie spring rolls, an order of Thai Curry Fried Rice and Szechuan Shrimp was informed they don't take debit and never did.  IT'S ON THEIR MENU, YES THE TINY INTERAC SYMBOL.  He then proceeded to hang up on me.  I'm in the food service industry.  I treat people in the same industry with equal if not MORE respect.  What a JOKE."}
{"text":"I love chinese,and I was frequenting this place regularly. What stopped me was that their customer service is sometimes okay,and sometimes AWFUL. They don't serve what I like to order on the weekends. And also,I wanted my sweet and sour sauce on the side instead of on my chicken balls and they said IMPOSSIBLE! I asked if I could even just pay extra for more on the side and they still said NO! who runs a business like that???  The real kicker was when a guy came in (while i was waiting for my takeout) and bought food for TEN people and the guy told him if he wants more than two packets of hot sauce he has to pay extra!  cheap !!!!"}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for pork.  Moving to Vancouver- my last meal wanted to be something that was well revived.  The dished were covered with a surguably mess, and 4 of the the three dishes had ASIAN BLACK hair in it.  I  threw out out the dishes because  my fiends and I were utterly disgusted.  When phoned back I was expressiveness my response- they wanted the dish back that to see ,y  puke and hair and puke in it.   I said ok and they said it was not worth reselling- OMG!! I will never ever order there again.  It was DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place is sick! Do not order here!"}
{"text":"Doesn't seem to matter much what you order; consistently good Chinese with items that can be hard to find in a neighborhood spot.   Moo Shu, fried pork dumplings, Crispy Ginger Beef, and a decent mango salad all hearty recommendations. Service is good too...compared to the passive aggressive sullen pusses you get too often."}
{"text":"C'est Bon, I wanted to like you, I really did but you had to go and break my heart ...  The food here really surprised me. But it wasn't the food that will prevent me from ever returning, its the recent experience.  I have been here twice, the first time we had amazing service from a very nice guy, he was very friendly and talkative. That would have been my first visit and I found C'est Bon from their coupon in the entertainment book. Which was for a free entree, I made sure before ordering that if I ordered rice that it would not be the free entree as rice is just a side if you ask me. The waiter insured us that they will remove the middle entree, which sure enough they did.   So we decided to go back after a couple weeks and there was different people working, a woman who I assume may have been the owner and a guy. The woman seemed to be ignoring people and eventually just disappeared and left altogether.  Anyway, we had another coupon, ordered the exact same food and when the bill came, the rice was the one that was removed..   Then we were told that's the way it is etc etc, basically he was trying to tell us that we were liars. That's a good way to keep customers from returning, the right thing would have been to fix it but he was very rude about the whole thing. Why be surprised when you don't get a tip is beyond me.  Based on this experience, I don't care how amazing the food is or isn't , I will never go back."}
{"text":"As the immortal Inigo Montoya said \"lemme esplain, no, there is too much, lemme summup\". This is a teeny restaurant with a French name that serves Chinese food while playing European classical music. They've been around for more than 10 years so clearly they are doing something right. They have about 10 parking spots in a tight lot (shared by the Subway next door) and about 10 tables. The decor is nice but the tables are kind of low-end, one of ours was wobbly. The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is pleasant except for the subway rumbling underneath you every so often. The bonus is that they have a patio, but it faces the parking lot and Yonge St. I noticed that they used a tea bag instead of loose tea leaves so for those who are picky about their brew that might be a turn off; on the plus side you don't get tea leaf build-up in your little cup. If you have never experienced the joys of deep-fried chocolate you absolutely must try the fried Mars bar (which apparently was invented in Scotland?) it is ridiculously good. The place was pretty empty for a Saturday night, so we enjoyed unhurried but prompt service. The food was very good and when they say something is spicy they mean it's spicy. It is traditional Chinese fare where you'd order a couple of different dishes to share. We go mainly for the Mars bar."}
{"text":"So I was out a-wandering on a nice, sunny day and I walked by C'est Bon, a restaurant I've been meaning to try out since moving into the area almost two years ago.  We decided to order from the lunch menu, since it's a hell of a deal. I went with the Kung Po chicken, and it was pretty good. Although it wasn't even a little spicy (boooo!), the dish was relatively flavorful and the portion was surprisingly generous. (I could've used more sauce, however.)  Unfortunately, my dining partner went with the Szenchuan Pork Noodle and she wasn't impressed. She was so unimpressed, in fact, that we would up switching dishes. (I'm just that nice of a guy.) I didn't think it was a terrible dish, to be fair, but it was definitely lacking in flavor. It was just one bite after another of the exact same taste. Some spices, some garnishes, anything might've helped."}
{"text":"I feel like C'est Bon has been around forever and yet I'd somehow never tried it before. We were looking to order some Chinese food for dinner one cold November night and I figured the time was right to finally give this place a shot.  Big mistake.  We ordered three items:  Home-Made Egg Roll: This basically tasted like a frozen egg roll you'd buy at the supermarket. There were no distinct flavors or textures contained within, and the filling all came out on the first bite. Some kind of sauce might've helped but all that was provided were a few generic packets of plum sauce.  We moved onto the mains hoping for an improvement. No dice.  Sweet and Sour Breaded with Fresh Pineapple: This was dominated by the garden-variety and very familiar sweet-and-sour taste one associates with sweet and sour chicken balls. It's as though they took a whole jar of that sickly-sweet concoction and dumped it into a bowl of breaded chicken. It was pretty nasty, actually. Making matters worse, the chicken was completely soggy from swimming in that sauce.  C'est Bon Spicy Chicken (\"One of our own creations and one of our best sellers\"): If this is one of their best sellers, I'd hate to see what does poorly on their menu. This really had virtually no flavor whatsoever, and it goes without saying that not a hint of spice was to be found. The chicken was mushy and the veggies were forgettable. What on earth would possess any restaurant to serve a dish this terrible?  So yeah, needless to say we shan't be ordering from C'est Bon again."}
{"text":"Cheap, big portions, huge selection of items, and quick take out.  What more could you want in a Chinese restaurant?  They have the typical non-authentic combo plates: fried rice, chicken balls, chicken chop suey, and an egg roll, all comes in a huge take out container than feels like it weighs about 10 pounds, for $7.  There is also a mix of more authentic dishes, and a dozen or so vegetarian dishes, if you're in to that.   Dessert choices are a fried mars bar or fried banana, according to their online menu. Ok, sure. Just roll with it."}
{"text":"Over priced, below average in selection, below average in taste.  Not entirely bad, but u can get much better and at a more reasonable price elsewhere.   If you have to stay in the area, I guess u can do worst, but it's not somewhere I would recommend."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how let down I am by the quality of the food I just had from this restaurant. I've been in for lunch once or twice to their location by Sporting Life and it was pretty good. Not so with this location.  Let's start with the good. The sliced BBQ pork appetizer was edible. That's it. The only good thing I've got to say.  The chicken balls (craving from childhood, pls don't judge!): were hours if not days old, dry as chalk, hard and not even remotely hot. I'm fairly certain they saw the inside of a microwave just long enough to warm them before they got to me.   The Beef Lo Mein: wasn't! I don't what it was but it wasn't Lo Mein and their less than 2oz of beef in the whole order. It was a tray of overlooked noodles in a slimy brown/red sauce. No veg of any kind save a few pieces of green onion and beef ($1 extra) would not have covered the palm of my hand in a single layer.   All in I bought a $32 dollar meal and 90% of it went in the trash. I'd advise you look for another place to eat/order!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this family owned restaurant and eat here regularly, lunch, dinner and take-out. There are two locations, one near Davisville and Yonge, and the other north of Eglinton just north of Sporting Life. This review is for the one by Sporting Life at Yonge and Blythwood Rd.  The owner and the chef are from Taiwan, so they seem to be at home cooking Thai, northern and southern Chinese as well as the Hong Kong style.   My favorite dishes are the fried pork dumplings, crispy ginger chicken, orange beef, Cantonese chow mein, and the stir-fried green beans. Their soups are never hot enough unless you ask for them to be hot temperature and hot spicy!   For lunch their specials are very good value, with $6.95 getting a full meal with soup, main and rice.  Service is excellent both in the small restaurant as well as for local delivery."}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to review C'est Bon! Familiarity means forgetting how special something is.  Everyone's laughing at the 'authentic' part of the title. So am I. It's authentic Chinese-Canadian food, complete with egg rolls and fortune cookies and fried rice. It is not what you'd get in Chinatown. That said, if you grew up with Chinese-Canadian takeout C'est Bon is miles and miles above the rest. It's less greasy and less salty, and more diverse -- not every Chinese takeout will have rice vermicelli or glorious black bean sauce or big boxes of perfectly prepared green vegetables. Or piles and piles of tofu on the menu. Vegetarians, this is where to get your tofu fix. The black bean sauce is absolutely to die for. I keep meaning to order other things but I keep going back to the black bean tofu. Everything they do is done well.  I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, although the storefront and patio look pretty nice for the class of restaurant. I always get delivery and it's super fast -- if they say 40 minutes it'll probably be under 30. They've never gotten an order wrong (despite the weird poor quality of the phone in a very loud kitchen) and everything is always hot and fresh. The free-delivery area is huge and there are two locations depending on whether you're north or south of Eg -- the 2680 Yonge store is the southern one, so if you're north call the other number.  I'll miss these guys when I make the inevitable move to a less expensive neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Chinese in a big city. Better than most, but still very predictable. The General Tao was excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - and it's my new fav place for that chinese food craving.   The staff here are friendly, especially the manager.  He takes extra care when serving you.  Restaurant is clean and modern.   I've been here for the lunch specials. Both times I ordered the General Tao Chicken.  It comes with rice and some veggies. I have a feeling that chinese tradition the veggies are served cold which is new to me.  I find it odd since this is the second chinese place that has done this to me.  Not a fan of my broccoli being cold but I just leave that to the side.   The portion is generous and just enough to stuff you for the rest of the day.  Most specials come with a spring roll OR soup.  And to top it all off you get a fortune cookie in the end...   Hope your fortune is a good one! :)"}
{"text":"Per my usual Xmas tradition, I ordered Chinese food for Xmas eve. Given I was at a friend's place, I was more than happy to try somewhere different that delivers to her part of the world.  First off, delivery took 2.5 hours. Now, I understand it's Xmas eve and the weather's awful, but if you don't want to take an order, say we're taking no more orders rather than it'll be an insane wait for delivery. My friend insisted we order from this place and we decided to wait until after 10 PM to have dinner.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the homemade egg rolls might be better if replaced by the frozen variety. Cooked properly, but taste dreadful. Beef ho fun was missing soy sauce, luckily there were sufficient packets to remedy this. For an \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant, this isn't a dish that should be wrong. General Tso chicken was average and the only dish that tasted like something. Chicken fried rice was below average, no discernible pieces of chicken to be found.  Admittedly, Xmas eve is not the time to be evaluating a delivery, but given the turnover, this should have been far better."}
{"text":"The most noticeable things in this restaurant are:  1) the strange straw roof over the bar/cashier that brushes against your head if you're tall 2) the chefs in the back talking very loudly in Cantonese in the kitchen  The staff here were very polite when I went. The lunch specials are priced very well at $7.95 including rice, soup, spring roll and fortune cookie.  The food was good. The wonton soup was satisfying but only had 2 wontons. the rice was fresh and the meat was not soggy with minimal amount of breading.  I would come here again. They have no wifi."}
{"text":"BOY COTT.  I hope the douche bag owner goes to hell.  The food isn't amazing. it's alright. I've been there so many times and the owner has always been rude to me ( i think now it might be a racist thing) despite the fact that i tend to order more than normal (i like take away for lunch the next day) and tip high.   One day, i placed an order for pick up that was meant for 10 ppl. I spent some good coin. When i went thereto pick up i asked him for hot sauce. He gave me two measly packets. I asked for more given the number of ppl. He gave me shit for asking for more going into his costs. I'm sorry but i don't see how two packets is enough for an order for 10 ppl, and then he tried to charge me 25cents a packet. I was not being unreasonable in any way. I just hate cheap people and i'm done with this place. It's an analogy and tells you how he must manage his kitchen.   Based on this experience, i don't trust his food. He'll do anything to save a buck or two.   Oh and on a few occasions, i've seen him yell at his staff pretty bad.  Now that you've read this story, keep an eye out for yourself and let me know what you experience."}
{"text":"Before you read this review, I am Korean and my companion is Chinese, and we both have been to many, many Chinese restaurants in Toronto, Markham, Richmond Hill and North York. Compared to those Chinese restaurants, this was quite a disappointment. The only reason we tried the food here is because we live at Yonge and Eglinton. The conclusion we have is there are NO good chinese restaurants around here.   On a Saturday night, we decided to get Chinese take-out and watch some basketball on TV at our place. We ordered House steamed pork dumplings and Ma-Po Tofu with Minced Chicken. Please note that we did not taste our order immediately after being cooked, so perhaps that is the reason for how it tasted, but then again, I don't really think so. First of all, the pork dumplings had some mightly thick wrappers and the filling wasn't that tasty, compared to other dumplings I've tasted at other Chinese restaurants. They did not provide enough sauce. The Ma-Po tofu is a favourite of mine and this wasn't a bad rendition but they did not provide any rice. I don't know how it is at \"White-people style\" Chinese restaurants, but anytime you order Ma-Po tofu at other Chinese restaurants, they always provide rice. What else soaks up all the sauce? It tasted okay, the sauce was well seasoned but they did not give enough. The tofu was cooked nicely and the chicken was a bit dry.   Given the price and SMALL portions, this restaurant does not stand up against any other Chinese restaurants in the GTA area. If you are in desperate need of okay Chinese food, you can come here. Also I wanted to mention, on a Saturday night, this place was completely empty while surrounding restaurants were filled."}
{"text":"I've never actually been to this place. I do take out only. I don't know about it being authentic Chinese cuisine, but it hits the spot on a lazy day when you don't feel like cooking. I mostly order in on the weekends (Sundays usually) and it usually takes only 30min. Large portions, quick delivery and ok vegetarian options.  Good bang for your buck and the only place I order in from.  Only once was my order mixed up. I ordered a green bean tofu dish and because they were out of tofu, they substituted it with little crumbly chicken bits! (not acceptable!). I called, they were apologetic and credited me for the amount of that dish. Problem solved."}
{"text":"It's standard Canadian-style Chinese food, done fairly well but it's not going to rock your world or anything.  Had the Kungpo chicken, mixed veggies, and shrimp-fried rice, all were good."}
{"text":"Best General Tao Chicken Ever! Why? Because its actual chicken!!! lol  The whitest meat I have seen in any General Tao Chicken I ordered before.    best location is the one on Yonge Street before Eglinton by Subway.  Parking is easy as its in the plaza and you don't have to find parking on the street.  Although its not a busy place ever, it is the Authentic Ces't Bon Restaurant and is nice and quiet.    The Shrimp Schechwan is amazing too!    So far, everything I have ordered there has been pretty good and I am a very picky eater. The Dumplings were nothing special and too big for my liking, that's my only bad critique of this place.  But everyone has their own opinion I guess."}
{"text":"We got Beef Broccoli, Cantonese Seafood Chow Mein, and House's Chili Prawns. They were okay. The portions were not that big for a Chinese restaurant. There were just too many broccolis in all the dishes. Where's my protein? :S I liked House's Chili Prawns the most. I agree with other reviewers that this place is more pricey than other Chinese restaurants. They offer delivery service."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  I am just writing a quick review to balance the strangely high rating.  The place is called C'est Bon -- what kind of Chinese restaurant has a French name?  Anyway, the food is worse than the Chinese food you get at the mall.  It's particularly bad.  Toronto doesn't have any good places to order Chinese food.   If you want good Chinese food, you'll have to head to Chinatown.  Otherwise, order a pizza."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. The service was quick. The food was okay. I ordered wonton soup, spring roles, steamed rice a tofu dish and chicken dish.  Everything was as I expected."}
{"text":"Not fancy, not fine dining, not exclusive, but tasty and simple. I go there often since it is steps away from my workplace at Yonge and Eglinton. The lunch specials are good (soup + choice of dish + spring roll for around $9). The pad thai is good - not unique but tastes good. I really enjoyed the spicy basil thai fried rice.   Good service too. They delayed my companion's meal by a few minutes so mine was waiting. They were extremely apologetic and took my food to reheat it in the microwave.  Nice place if you want a casual chinese meal."}
{"text":"Walked in to a quaint little place with a French name on a Chinese Board and a Hawaiin like tikki shack as their bar / cashier area. Initially I didn't have high hopes for obvious reasons but I was pleasantly surprised. There seemed to be a never ending amount of people walking in to pick up their take out orders so I guess this place is more popular for that than dine-ins. Which is understandable as it looked like they only had about 6 tables altogether.   We ordered the Tom Yum soup, extra spicy, which I found amazing and it also tremendously helped open my sinus and taste buds for the evening. If you have a flu / cold, this is a must-try menu item on the list. You can thank me later. We also ordered the Manchu chicken and General Tao chicken and I completely agree with Sherry K. on yelp and found the General Tao chicken really good. I wasn't too fond of the Manchu chicken or the service as such but am looking forward to a trip back to this place to try their other items, perhaps their Schezwan Shrimp as a lot of people who were walking in seemed to be ordering it that day."}
{"text":"I have not even finished my meal yet, just the appetizers, and this restaurant is so damn good, I'm writing my review now.   If you seek American-style Chinese, this is the LAST place in Toronto that does a top notch job. Do yourself a favor, and come and eat the food immediately."}
{"text":"This place is as EXPENSIVE AS HELL!  Stupid me - I forgot my previous experience with this place when they stuffed menus in our mailboxes again.   I made the mistake of ordering from them again.  The portions are SMALL - and WAY, way too pricey.  The food is MEH - and not worth it.  Go somewhere else.  You've been warned.  (You wondered about the cost?  over $70 for 5 small dishes - when I can get MORE food than this at other places for close to half that price.)"}
{"text":"Delivery takes 45- 50 min. Big portions. Hot delicious food. Great specials/ combos! Only place i order chinese from!"}
{"text":"Warning! Warning! Warning!   I have lived in the area for years and always kind of wonder about Cest Bon - my mistake. Yelp ratings were mixed with both low and high ratings.   Sorry I'm not sure how this place received high ratings. Maybe it depends on who's cooking that night. I think i got the fifth string apprentice cook (your fired!) or maybe the cook quit and the dishwasher took over.   Oh my, words cannot describe my experience. My taste buds are ruined forever.   Utterly horrible. Actually kind of disgusting.   Here we go.   Vegetable chow meIn was the worst I ever had. A weird sauce and overcooked noodles.  Usually chow meIn noodles are crispy but the noodle I had was soggy. Rating 1/10.   Second dish was their so  called house specialty - sweet and sour chicken. Chicken was ok but the sauce and breading were off. Not sour enough. Rating 4/10.   Third dish was Ma Po Spicy Tofu with chicken. I have had this dish hundreds of times (not exaggerating!) and this was by far the worst I have ever eaten. Rating 3/10.  I hate to offer such a poor rating but it was simply BAD food.   So unless you have no taste buds, the food here is garbage (actually great place for it)."}
{"text":"I always knew of Ho Lee Chow being the worst Chinese food in Toronto but now the torch has been passed on. C'est Bon offers all day delivery and prompt service; where they go wrong is their awful food, especially their house specialty Spicy Chicken."}
{"text":"I've walked by this little Chinese restaurant many times but decided last night to give it a first try.  We were promptly seated.  They may have been having some heating issues as it was a bit cold and they appeared to have been compensating with a space heater.  We were seated promptly.  The staff were very friendly.  The food came quickly and was quite good.  We had vegetarian spring rolls, chicken wings. General Tao Chicken and pineapple and shrimp curried rice.  All of the dishes were tasty and the portions were generous.  While eating, I notices a steady takeout business including two pick ups from Uber eats. It was good food for value as well.   I would eat there again."}
{"text":"The quality of food at this place zig-zags quite a bit. One day, it'll be fantastic and the next time, an absolute disaster. Keep seeing new wait staff there as well. Either they're changing chefs remarkably fast or there's a strong need for quality control."}
{"text":"Times like this I wish yelp had half stars, I would have rated 3.5. The food can be the most amazing Canadian-Chinese food I've ever had however more than once I've had a brutal experience. I only get take-out, It is expensive but you get a 10% cash discount on pickup. I ordered for 2 last night and it was $63 for chowmein, 3 mains, one springroll and a small steamed rice however it was one of those amazing bang on nights and well worth it. The last time I ordered for 3 $78 and it was so terrible I walked back and asked for a full refund which was the only time out of more than 20+ orders where I actually did that. I'm thinking maybe they put a note in my account not to screw with me because I will return and be a very polite pain. Sidenote: they make you ask for chopsticks, I hate that because I always forget. They should ask me every time how many chopsticks I need. General Tao. Crispy Ginger Beef. Honey RIBS!"}
