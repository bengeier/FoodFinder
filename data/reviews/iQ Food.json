{"text":"I love IQ Food! It's my go to spot for a quick healthy and filling lunch. The staff are always super friendly and patient when I can't decide what I want to order (the menu all looks so good!) My favourite is the super sorrell but the 5 star is becoming a new regular order. Definitely recommend stopping in here if you're in the area! Also, the portion sizes are super generous and I often end up saving some for a 3:00 pm snack :)"}
{"text":"Excellent salads and boxes. I have tried the Sparta and  Winter greens box. It's a fresh great financial district option. Dressing are given on the side."}
{"text":"First and foremost, did you all know how much SODIUM is hidden in your \"healthy\" IQ food? Too much. Way too much! Just check their website. 

The food is terrible - the Spicy Salmon was barely edible as it was dry and unseasoned. The rest of the box was a mishmash of ... I don't know, ingredients? It was not good. I ordered dinner from a different place as I couldn't eat or possibly be satisfied with that less-than-mediocre food. 

The iced tea was good. 

Don't waste your money. Place some greens and quinoa in a bowl yourself, throw a dressing overtop and call it some fancy name. Voila!"}
{"text":"Good food, but Bad customer service and handling of vegetarian orders.
I am a vegetarian and used to enjoy stopping by this place on my walk home to pick up a healthy and easy dinner for myself and husband. However, on the last 2 occasions I have order the Lima bowl and requested that the chicken be replaced with tempeh, but instead I found chicken mixed in with the tempeh. The first time it was 1 piece of chicken, so I didn't complain despite my queasiness. The second time my husband's Lima bowl was full of chicken along with tempeh. Our dinner was ruined. I place a call to complain only to get a voicemail and I left my concern on the recording. That was over 2 weeks ago and I have received no response or compensation from QI"}
{"text":"I've never heard of this place but happened to be in the area and thought I could check it out. Everything in there looked really fresh and service was fast, even though lots of people were waiting. My main complaint is that there was no vegan protein available, all the boxes had to contain some kind of meat. I opted out for the avocado toast which was ok but I was really disappointed with their selection."}
{"text":"I think they need to improve their dishes as the fish and chicken are too dry.  Last time I saw a lot of flies at the dessert bar."}
{"text":"Very expensive, long lines and not worth it. Didn't go back after the first time - overhyped."}
{"text":"iQ Foods' description on their website about the food they serve: \"The kind that makes you feel like climbing Kilimanjaro. We make almost everything we serve in house, from scratch. Only whole grains. Only lean proteins. Only good fats. No refined carbs. No bad fats. No fried anything.\" - what can go wrong with this?

My ultimate favorite is the Lima Box.
Which includes: Roasted Chicken, Aged White Cheddar, Avocado, Corn, Black Beans, Grape Tomatoes, Cilantro, Lime Wedge, Hot Sauce, and Brown Rice/Quinoa

Absolutely delicious and highly recommended to try if you work in the area!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.  On one hand, there's nothing on the menu that I couldn't make myself at home for a quarter of the price.  on the other.... I'd have to clean up afterwards.  :)  

I'm not one to buy a food court lunch.  If I'm going to pay for lunch I generally want it served to me with a wine option.  As it stands, on those days that you forget or decide that the leftover meatloaf isn't going to cut it this is a good option.  

Each box, salad or wrap is put together with care - as if it was for their own mother - and the ingredients that are meant to be crisp are crisp, soft soft, and chewy chewy.     

as a plus, you can substitute pretty much anything and they have features that really take advantage of seasonal (if not local) produce."}
{"text":"Soo good especially considering how healthy it is! Finally guilt free and satisfying. Favs are Lima or blueberry crunch in second"}
{"text":"Yummy. Fresh. Healthy. 

A friend introduced me to IQ Food and boy I was quite impressed by how delicious this healthy box was! 

I had the Apple Cobb. Warm chicken breast, apple, cheese, quinoa, spinach, dried cranberries with a side of honey dijon dressing. Perfect balance of flavors with every bite!

This will definitely be a regular lunch spot for me! Can't wait to try some other salads! Forgot to mention, the serving was super filling too. Healthy eating never tasted soooo good!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch often, at least when it's not too busy. Some days the line goes out the door. Even when there are about 10 people ahead of me in line, the service is pretty quick, but there are faster (and someone less popular) places in the area.

They have 6-8 pre-planned bowls that you can choose from, or you can customize your own bowl. You can also swap items in the pre-planned bowls. This is great for people who want to avoid specific ingredients, or like to swap their dressings.

My favourite is the Lima, which I usually take with the jalape√±o vinaigrette.

The portions are a good size for lunch, but a little on the pricey side.

It's easy to see which people have never been here before as they get confused with the order system. In this restaurant, there's a line for ordering, and then you stand around waiting for your name to be called. This can be confusing for newcomers."}
{"text":"One of the best local places around my work.  Price is high, but quality of the ingredients is top notch, just found that the portion sizes have gone down even more from their already small portions.  I'm kinda surprised by this, which caused a downgrade of a star for me.  I don't think I will go back for such a miniscule portion.  Hopefully it was just an off day, I'm sure I will actually go back at some point! :)"}
{"text":"Service was great and the food quality was exactly as described - healthy, fresh, and delicious. Had a phenomenal experience and enjoyed the chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came to Toronto for two days and stopped into iQ on my way out of town and was blown away. The Lima was excellent. My body thanked me for the clean fuel when I went for a workout later. 

Hearty and tasty salads w/ some carbs, smoothies, baked goods, and coffee, served ready for me to run out the door, like I usually am. I would come in everyday if I lived in Toronto. The finishing touch that sealed the deal for me was the avocado toast. I make it at home in California at least twice a week, and even there where avos are plentiful I get strange looks on occasion. And for me, coming from San Francisco, the prices were great."}
{"text":"Best quick, healthy, and tasty food option in Toronto. PERIOD!"}
{"text":"I was about to downgrade my rating to 2*  for my bad experience on Aug 7.  I purchased a Lima lunch box that day, returned to my office which is 10 mins away by foot, to find that the hot sauce/dressing was missing.  It was a very busy day at work and I couldn't afford myself an extra 20 mins back and forth for it.  I called the number on their receipt, hoping that someone will be able to deliver it to me.  What was I thinking???  I called at the peak of their lunch rush hour, and no one even bothered to pick up the phone.  I ended up eating my Lima box sad and dry.  It was the worst lunch box I ever had from iQ!  So I wrote to tell them that I was extremely disappointed.  Didn't hear back, so I made up my mind to go to Flock instead whenever I have a salad craving.  

But they made it up to me!  A little late, but better late than never.  Their Experience Manager apologized in her response and explained to me that my email, for some reason, went into junk/spam.  Today I redeemed a lunch box on the house.  And yes, iQ Food, you won me back!  There are many new health and organic food outlets downtown today, but iQ remains my favorite!

What I learned from the bad experience?  I would check my takeout order before I leave their counter every time!"}
{"text":"Generally good. Boxes can be inconsistently assembled particularly in terms of how much dressing ends up on it but usually works out fine. I found a rock in my food once and emailed them about it, never heard back. Otherwise hard to complain. Real food done well."}
{"text":"Portion is on the small side based on the price. For the location of the restaurant, and the quality of the ingredient, it's not unreasonable."}
{"text":"So rumour has it they make $10,000 a day - can anyone please confirm this?

After all the hype, i HAD to try it out. I planned a whole lunch hour to get myself there and stand in line did thorough research on what to try - i don't work too close so i needed to get this right.

The long line up can be discouraging however they have a car assembly line like production line making those sweet lunch boxes so fear not you'll make it to browsing the internet at your desk back on time! 

(a) Lima box - my favourite! loved the vinaigrette and all the toppings - had it with quinoa.

(b) Sparta box - with brown rice. I wasn't too crazy about it however i am the only one i know who did not like it as much. Its a GReek salad with rice or quinoa - your choice. Cherry tomatoes, get, cucumber and dressing.

Whatever they're doing, they doing it SO right. I wish i had shares in the joint!"}
{"text":"I still love the Beet & Goat Cheese wrap (and occasionally the sweet potato & lentil wrap).  

But sometimes I'm drawn to other options on the menu - and then I realize they almost all have chicken in them.   I'm not a vegetarian, but I generally prefer to have a meatless lunch.  I've asked if I can omit the chicken, but they tell me the price stays the same (and IQ Foods is *not* cheap by any means).  I'm told I can substitute it for tofu or tuna.

I'm a bit surprised that they don't have more vegetarian options.  I'm not even a vegetarian, but even I know that not all vegetarians like tofu?!

Less than 25% of the menu items don't contain chicken.  Seems odd.  And a total of 3 items don't contain chicken, tofu, or tuna.

C'mon IQ Foods!   Bring on some more meatless lunches for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"So happy that there is a 2nd iQ Foods now open, even closer to my office.  This one is on the ground level, just East of Ki at Bay & Wellington.  Lots of seating, very fresh and clean atmosphere, plenty of natural daylight.  The lines can be long at lunch, but they move really quickly.   My favourite lunch choice has always been the Beet & Goat Cheese Wrap, and they've beefed it up a bit lately by adding kale.  I wasn't sure if I was thrilled about that at first, but it really is a welcome addition!  Especially since the price of the wrap is not really any different from the menu choices with meat - so I'm glad there is finally more bang for the buck with this one.

I'll always wish for more non-tofu vegetarian options.  I've covered this in my review of their TD Center location.  

Awesome menu, if a little on the pricey side.  Lots of great healthy options.  Oh, and this location has some muffins, cookies, and coffee!"}
{"text":"So I thought I was the only one who noticed the changes in the quality and size of their lunch boxes but it looks like I'm not the only one!  I've been a big fan and supporter of this place since it opened but have noticed as of late that their boxes are getting smaller and smaller.  I went there last week for lunch and was thoroughly disappointed with my Glow box: measly amount of quinoa, sweet potatoes were sad and mushy, my avocado was not fresh.  Hopefully the owner(s) will read these reviews, take note, and return IQ to its original glory."}
{"text":"Still unbeatable in the financial district! I always get the Glow on my vegetarian days and the Lima when I feel like something spicy. The boxes are more filling than they seem to be (love the roasted sweet potatoes!). I go at around 11:30 or after 2 to avoid the long lineup."}
{"text":"OK - Generally I like the place. Worth the wait, food is fresh and quality is high.

I have to admit, walking away with my Lima lunchbox today was pretty disappointing.

All the ingredients are there, but the quantity is much, much smaller than usual. Is this place starting to cheapen itself with tiny portions now ??

I hope this is not a trend, if so I might have to strike this location from my list, which would be very sad.

Boxes filled with quinoa or rice, and a selection of healthy toppings - there's competition out there. IQ better not slack off"}
{"text":"They made salad taste amazing...I always feel good coming out of here.

Trendy place to eat, the staff is friendly! Check it out"}
{"text":"I've tried a few of their lunch boxes and have enjoyed them all.  A bit on the pricier side but fine as long as you don't go everyday. 

Lunch lineup gets really long but moves quickly."}
{"text":"I pass by the TD Food Court and come across this new company.  There is a long line up always for a new place.  I want to give it a try and order Sparta (Grilled Chicken, Grape Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Feta Cheese, Brown Rice and Extra Virgin Olive Oil & Aged Balsamic Vinegar) and a Tomato soup total $13.75.  The food is stored in a rectangular paper box.  The taste does not mix together with the chilled cucumbers on top, the brown rice a bit hard and the chicken on the side warm.  When I put a spoonful of the food inside my mouth, it is no where near the Four which also presents the food in the same way in Commerce Court East Concourse.  The soup is not extraordinary.  

With that price range, I expect at least to be good.  I can spend less money with better food.  Although it stress the chicken is not bagged and is only with 50 km from shipping, it does not give me the fresh chicken smell and taste.  The chicken if it is the theme should be much better.  A bit disappoint !!"}
{"text":"Go to place for the bankers and lawyers who eat out every meal. The boxes are fresh tasting and unique and customization is easy. Lines are huge at the lunch hour rush, but generally the place is quick in non-peak times. The decor itself is a bit sterile and the seats not very comfortable, but it works with the fresh/healthy theme and the idea of not staying long. The concept is miles ahead of Freshii and a pioneer in the downtown healthy lunch scene."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy food, from snacks to small bites to hearty boxes and desserts. Servers are so friendly and helpful. They allow you to customise your meal if you order a box. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Iced tea with carbonated water? I could see that it was bubbling up when they were pouring it in the cup so I asked if it was carbonated. They said \"No, it is not carbonated and it's just how it looks when we pour it!!! \"
Turns out it was actually carbonated and they had no idea what they are actually serving!"}
{"text":"nice place! i got a avocado toast. it was good.  my husband got the apple cobb salad , it was delicious."}
{"text":"I bought the \"glow\" box. Great salad. Absolutely yummy! Topped it off with a lime and turmeric kefir water. Perfect meal for me!"}
{"text":"Never really been into all veggie food but this was exceptionally good. Def going back."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while traveling. It's a nice place with a lot of vegetarian and vegan options. I got their salmon box with a cacao smoothie. Very delicious. Would visit again! It's faster if you order online."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite salad spot!

Their salad is fresh and tasty.  I am a carnivore and I actually get salad from there.  There portion is good that will not leave you hungry and can last the whole work day.  The all veggie no meat five star was my favorite item on the menu.  I used to like their seasonal squash soup,  but there was one time it was extremely salty that I have to dilute with water and reheat in microwave.

Service is fast despite the long line.

You can order by Ritual ahead of time.

Oh they are card only (no cash)."}
{"text":"I've never had such a satisfying and filling salad before! 
One of my coworker raved about this place. So i decided to try it out. I got the Lima box as she recommended. No regrets! Food arrived within 20 min after ordering. The ingredients are very fresh, good portion, a lot for a lunch meal actually. On top of a bed of brown rice, there are avocado, cabbage, chicken breast, corn, cherry tomatoes and garnished with jalape√±o cilantro. The sauce is spicy and had such a kick to it. The chicken are surprisingly moist. Love the taste and texture of the veggie combination. I was so stuffed after eating just half of the salad. It didn't taste like salad but it was a salad!! I didn't have any of the empty feeling I usually have with eating salads lol. 
 I rushed the ordering process, should've subbed the cherry tomatoes with avocado. So yea their salads are highly customizable,  you can substitute any of the ingredients you don't like, or add extra ingredients. 

I would recommend iQ food and I am looking forward to order again!

However, most of their salads are high in calories and sodium, there's a reason why they taste so good. So if you are on a diet, better customize your salad."}
{"text":"This is one of my go tos when I don't have a lunch but don't want to eat unhealthily! 

IQ is your typical box salad/bowl. They have a range of different mixes. All the ingredients they use are fresh and you can taste it when you eat it. This place is good for vegans and vegetarians. And they offer chicken and salmon for those who cannot forgo the meat! (Me) 

Great boxes that filly you up for 11 bucks are:
The glow
Lima

And they have seasonal items on the menu as well, they change this about every 2 months.

The desserts and smoothies are also delicious and healthy. A lot of vegan options are offered for the desserts.

In addition to the great food they offer, this location is very fast with their service. They have a great set up where you first order with your name and then another station the pay, and another to wait for you food which never takes more than 3 minutes. 

This is an awesome place if you need to go quickly and go back to your desk right away! 

My favourite!"}
{"text":"Right at the heart of financial district at bay/wellington, iQ offers lots of healthy choices for a nice sit down lunch inside where there's free wifi or for take out. 

This was my first time visiting and I ordered \"Lima\" ($10 after tax) which had chicken, spicy corn, grape tomatoes, avocado, white cheddar, jalapenos, pickled cabbage, cilantro, lime juice, brown rice and hot sauce. The staff were friendly and service was quick. I'll be back again to try out all their other options."}
{"text":"Best lunch spot in Toronto!  A bit pricey (meal + drink = ~$15) but worth it for the fresh fruits and vegetables.  Warning though, the Gingerade isn't the best but everything else I've had has been great!"}
{"text":"Overpriced hipster-businessman food. The kimchee doesn't have any Korean ingredients in it. The meals have horrible pun names, so the head chef must be a bit of a head case. Financial district people line up because there is a line up in which to be seen.  Grabs hold of fading trends and appropriates them into a sub par approximation of other, better fast food restaurants' attempts."}
{"text":"They should call this place TASTY-YUM Food Co.!

iQ is a healthy, quick, take-out place in the TD Centre food court.  They offer a menu of boxes, salads and wraps, all focused on keeping things healthy, fresh and very flavorful.

I like the idea that they do a few things really really well.  The line-ups can get big, so come early (although the line does move - they are very efficient).

The wraps are great- full of flavor, filling, yet fresh and light tasting.  Overall a great lunch spot while in the downtown core."}

{"text":"This place is a little too tree hugger for me... had a brown rice with chicken and assorted veggies, in some spicy sauce. It definitely seemed like it was on the healthy side, but didn't really taste that great- was expecting the chicken and rice to be warm, didn't taste right cold."}
{"text":"Mmmm wow! I was sceptical about the hype but I'm definitely jumping on this bandwagon! 

Incredibly fast service and straight forward, fresh offerings. 

I got the Lima - oven roasted chicken, spicy corn, black beans, grape tomatoes, avocado, aged white cheddar, jalape√±os, pickled cabbage, cilantro, lime juice, brown rice, hot sauce. 

To be honest when I opened the box I was unimpressed. Sure colourful, but a mish mash of unassuming ingredients which looked like a small quantity since the box wasn't very full! 

But was I ever wrong! Just an explosion of flavour truly! Beautiful combination. It's dressed with a very bright and tangy lime vinaigrette of sorts which is so refreshing! Served with a little container of hot sauce which was a great pairing. 

When I went to Kupfert and Kim I wasn't as impressed, though they have similar type of offerings. I'd say iQ seasons with more bold, bright, and fresh flavours (only judging by this one dish I've tried)! Will definitely be back to iQ!"}
{"text":"Yummy and trendy spot to stop for lunch in between business meetings. I was in town for a few hours and a friend suggested this joint (within walking distance from Union Station). They make beautiful salad boxes - great variety - and healthy snacks. I Really liked that all ingredients are locally sourced and the menu varies depending on availability of seasonal produce. 

Another + seems to be that you can order your meal online and come pick it up without queuing. 

A little pricey but good quality."}
{"text":"Debit card or Credit card only! They have gone cashless. Located in the TD Food Hall and accessible thru the path.

I visited twice and I ordered the Apple Cobb Salad and Lima boxes on separate visits. They make it fresh on the spot and they are pretty quick on getting orders out during the lunch hour rush.

The boxes look very fresh every time and I just can wait to eat. The Apple Cobb Salad is definitely not really my favourite out of the two. The honey dijon vinaigrette definitely had a wasabi spicy kick to it. I thought that sauce ruined the entire box for me. 

So on another visit, I gave them another try with the Lima box and for sure I love the taste of the ingredients and the hot sauce was amazing. Everything complemented each other. 

I will be back again if I want a healthy meal and will try a different box. They also have seasonal items as well so it's definitely a good place to check out."}
{"text":"Pros:
+ Chic ambiance, very clean, there's a few sit down spots
+ Food is yummy, very healthy, fresh, high quality ingredients
+ they put the sauce on the side by default

Cons:
- The value is bad. The portion is small for how much it costs

Other:
+ No cash, only debit / credit / phone"}
{"text":"It was a perfect, fresh, interesting, healthy lunch.  Plllleeeeezzzzeee open one in Boston!"}
{"text":"The food is so so good, deceptively good since its supposed to be all healthy. There's some article claiming that each dish is some 800cal..,,can't attest to that but if you are looking for a place serving good quality healthy (?) food during weekdays, iQ food is it"}
{"text":"Holy crap, I just got this sweet potato box off uber eats and I'm blown away. I wasn't sure about this orange citrus dressing, but it was so good I was licking the container. Maybe I was just starving but this was the best healthy meal I've had delivered in a long time."}
{"text":"Folks we have winner on hand here if you are tired of mundane food court offerings that leave you bloated and unsatisfied this place will not only satiate your food craving you will come out feeling light and not bad on what you had. 
My friends kept on recommending this place to me for the past few months and these folks are what you health conscious eaters (read health food deliveries and reading of all the ingredients, calorie counter etc. etc.) and they enjoyed their food so much that even cancelled their pricey food delivery service and tend to have an almost daily meal at this spot. With so much pressure on moi the expectations were sky high, I was expecting something a tad better than food court offering which I avoid like a plague and just another health craze. 
I am happy to report this place works I felt full after the meal I had here and still felt light. I tried their bellwood box and it was fresh and full of so many ingredients that I am curious to know what their food costs are as surely with that much on offer it will be on the higher side of the spectrum. Not overwhelming by any means I would describe it as a very hearty salad. 
We came here in the evening and my friends had their menu options picked already (the sales person even knows them by name now) and good thing for regulars is that they have their regular menu and seasonal offering so one wouldn't get bored. 
I would recommend that if you are within the vicinity and part of the lunch crowd you owe it to yourself to give this place a try. 
4 Stars!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick light lunch...  Line ups move fast.  I tried the Spartan box which is basically a Greek salad with super foods and it was delicious,  light,  and full of protein.  My group were all pleased with their orders with the exception of a peculiar probiotic drink they had. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Favorite lunch, hands down. Tried few of their boxes and loved them all. Spicy salmon and mission chicken are probably my favorites. Their iced latte is a treat too!"}
{"text":"I would very much like not to love this place.  It is cloyingly pretentious, full of corporate d-bags, overly stylized, crazy long line ups, overpriced, etc.  Sounds horrible, right? NOPE -  it's damn good.  It's healthy and delicious and the flavour combinations are interesting and complementary.  I eat here a solid 4 times a week at about $11.50 for lunch.  The line moves shockingly quickly.  The service is sometimes friendly-ish but frankly its a quick lunch spot, so who cares?  I am not kidding when I say that I contacted them about possible franchise opportunities.  That is how much I truly enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Help! I've fallen for iQ and I can't get up from this table full of delicious rice bowls, vegans GF treats and superb lattes! If they had laptop plugs I might never leave. Delicious - and amazing customer service.... except when the kitchen gets my order wrong or forget components, which happens a lot more than I'd like. But here I am, still at the table in full appreciation."}
{"text":"Loved it! Delicious food, especially if you are craving a hearty healthy vegetarian salad. Didn't expect to be so full. I ordered the 5 star."}
{"text":"I came yesterday night and my Lima and raw cacao almond still tasted great ! I think I'll come here more often in the night now!

Add tempeh to your boxes, for a vegan protein pick up and Who ever does the avacodo toast, they don't skimp out on avocado, It is as delicious as it gets, thank you for making art on my toast."}
{"text":"You can feel the hipster vibes from a mile away with this one. iQ is a fairly expensive (about $12-14 for a box) shop tucked into the Bay & Wellington area there is also an indoors location if you follow the path down from Royal Bank plaza) that looks unsuspecting but is in fact quite a popular joint among the healthy eaters of Toronto (from what I surmise). I tried the Purple Haze and Apple Cobb boxes  (both seasonal, I believe). The latter was absolutely delicious - generous portions of goat cheese topping a tasty and flavourful medley of quinoa, chicken, pear and perhaps a few other minor notes. The former, however, was more or less a radish salad with a few extra ingredients - not bad but not very memorable. I've also tried iQ's variant of a peaches & cream smoothie which is a bit pricey for a drink (about $8 if memory serves) and was alright."}
{"text":"It took me a bit to find iQ Food!  I tried to find the one on York without success, and so took a stab at this one, and finally found the entrance around the corner on Wellington.  I was glad I didn't give up too quickly!  This was a great option for a quick, light dinner.   I had a Lima box which was great!  Lots of fresh vegetables, black beans, avocado, cheese, tasty chicken and brown rice.  I loved the spicy dressing!   I also appreciate that they try to use locally sourced ingredients; this is always a bonus for me!   Service was fast and friendly.   Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food!"}
{"text":"Located in the PwC Tower, you can definitely expect to stand in a long line at iQ during the week for lunch, but it usually goes very quickly. Service is friendly and pleasant. It's good food. I mainly enjoy the Lima box with brown rice and some substitutions on the standard ingredients, which they easily allow you to do. It's not really clear that you don't have to stick to the standard ingredients on the board, but all you have to do is ask. For any box, I have always been able to substitute a few \"basic\" or \"premium\" ingredients, same for same, with no extra charge.  For $10 (Lima box) it's maybe a couple of bucks over-priced. Yet for quality and freshness of food, it's also probably fair. Portion-wise, I find it ample and filling.  The avocado toast, on the other hand, is definitely overpriced for the skimpy offering. You'll chide yourself for this and never buy it again (at least that's how I felt).  The lentil soup is good but without knowing the sodium content, not something I'd buy regularly. I have yet to try any of the smoothies etc.  Although the dishes seem fairly nutritious, as with all prepared food, the customer needs to be self-informed.  iQ continues to state on their website that the nutrition information is coming soon, but it has been many months already.  I have a suspicion that they don't want you to know the nutrition content.  Regardless of the \"nutritious\" angle, like all other prepared food: it's OK once in a while, but not on a regular basis.  Given this location's proximity to the Rogers Centre and the ACC, if you do need a quick meal, it's not a bad option. They're open until 8 PM even on week nights and open on the weekends. Their decor is cool and well done; I like the concept. This location does have limited inside seating and a small patio."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Chicago and found this to be the perfect spot for healthy eating while traveling. Reminds me of Protein Bar."}
{"text":"Awesome and healthy lunch spot...tasty and super fresh!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place after a co-worker recommended it, and I am so happy that I did. Their menu items are on the pricier side, but it was totally worth it and delicious!

I had the Butter Squash salad with quinoa. This comes with chicken, roasted butternut squash, beets, green beans, goat cheese, honey cider dijon vinaigrette pumpkin seeds, green pea shoots.  I love their approach and philosophy on food. Almost all the ingredients are made in house from scratch. It's fresh, whole grains, good fat, no refined carbs, and no fried food. It's not only tastes great, but is healthy for you too!

I love the decor inside. Inside it feels very bright and airy. There is also this great green wall on the left side of the location. 

Service was quick and efficient.

I'll be back to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Love the Avacado toast! The lentil soup for the south Asian palette may be a lil off but I think it's a great healthy protein specially the day you do not was to feel like a cow (grazing salad). Tried the Turkey Chilli and was very impressed. Just the perfect balance of spices and heat toned down by the sour cream and Avacado.

Great place, quick service and most of all - amazing online ordering tool. It's ready by the time you walk over!"}
{"text":"This place was so on point in every single way I don't even know where to begin. 

Very trendy, very clean, upscale and simply fabulous. 


THE DETAILS: 

The options were fantastic. I'm on this fitness kick and it's hard to find actual healthy food that's quick while on the go. I was visiting Toronto from Vancouver and I was so excited to stumble across this place since my options were so limited. The combinations of ingredients were awesome and all worked so harmoniously together. As harmonious as the service actually, it was all just wonderful. 
I didn't want goat cheese in my bowl and he offered to throw in some avocado instead, I won't lie, I was really stoked and surprised. I didn't even think that was an option so when he offered to sub it I really appreciated that! Super friendly, I wish I caught his name! The other staff was very friendly & helpful too while answering some of my questions. I just had to ask about all the amazing looking healthy deserts!! And they were all Actually healthy and the one I tried was delicious! Things I could actually eat, finally! Yay! The brownie was so moist and decadent. It has cocoa powder and yam in it and has everything I'm allowed to have! Lowest calorie count for deserts on their menu. A MUST try. 

I had the 100k chicken bowl and it was beyond fabulous. That basil-jalape√±o vinaigrette was boss fucking sauce. Just, wow. They need to bottle that b*tch and sell it in grocery stores. Amazing. I could drink it by itself. Seriously. 

Annnd I have to mention that during my 20 minutes dining in the place, I saw a flood of really good looking well dressed business men and women. Mainly men though... Actually the majority were men Hahaha. Seems like a hot spot for a good looking men in nice suits... Something I noticed haha kind of exciting .. just saying. . ;)

{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, so I came back for lunch. I am upgrading them to 3 stars because the Lima box and date cookie were both good, and service was quick. I am hesitant to upgrade them beyond 3 stars because their Iced Americano and Blue Magic Smoothie were completely disappointing.

I ordered an Iced Americano, Lima box sans cheese, and date cookie. 

The Iced Americano was super disappointing. I didn't think it was possible to make disappointing coffee (I am not a picky coffee drinker), but it is. I asked if they put anything in it, because it looked light brown (like iced tea), and they said they didn't. It tasted more like water than coffee, so I was able to put 2 and 2 together. Come on, guys. Pilot Coffee is highly revered by my hipster friends, so it's a shame I wasn't able to really try it.

The Lima box was good, a solid 8 out of 10. If you're going to get it, keep in mind it's pretty spicy. They were good about accommodating me, as I can't have dairy, so they omitted the cheese and gave me extra avocado instead (at their suggestion). That was nice of them.

The date cookie is apparently a bestseller and sells out quickly, so I had to try one. It was pretty good. Soft, tasty, not too sweet.

My friend ordered a Blue Magic Smoothie, which she has had before, and was disappointed. It didn't taste like it did the first time, was thin, and tasted like nothing but lemons. 

Verdict: I'll be back for another box, maybe the spicy salmon,or cookie, but I will never order another beverage here because based on our experience, they are inconsistent at best, and disappointing at worst."}
{"text":"If you are okay to pay 7$ for a piece of toasted bread and avocado or 5$ for a cup of water downed lentil soup, this place can give you a take out, since there are literally 4 small tables only.

To be fair, very nice staff, very nice interior design and variety of Salad boxes, plus rent is not cheap, but I am a student and I am hungry."}
{"text":"Sparta was delish but in my opinion, a little too small of a portion for a meal with limited protein. Needed more!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. The concept is perfect. It should be exported to other cities."}
{"text":"Tried Roots for the first time. A bit disappointed on the dried and dying cabbage and how little cottage cheese I got... flavour is alright. Healthy option tho!"}
{"text":"I had the Lima, which was loaded with veggies, chicken, beans, and a tangy slightly spicy sauce, served over brown rice. Super filling, I couldn't finish it. Service was really quick and friendly. The food isn't complicated to make but there's a good variety in one box and it's healthy as well."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious and such nice staff! They guy who rang me up gave me awesome suggestions and food was ready fast. Spicy salmon salad is AMAZING! Chia pudding is a perfect pick me up in the AM!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy lunch option, IQ Food Inc. is your go to place. Yes, the prices are a little on the expensive side but usually healthy food isn't ever cheap. I like their variety of boxed salads. They are all packed with protein and even if you get the salads without protein, they are pretty filling. I usually get the Cobb Salad which had chicken, apple, quinoa, spinach, a few other ingredients topped with honey dijon dressing. Total price works out to $13 but it's a decent sized portion for lunch. I like this location because it's stand alone store compared to the location inside the TD food court which always has a lineup."}
{"text":"cool concept but i wouldnt go back.
i got the \"five star bowl\" which was veg. halfway through it i was already done with it. i'd recommend the bowls at kupfert and kim instead. my bowl hd a weird aftertaste."}
{"text":"I got the spicy salmon box and it was actually really good. I am not usually a salad person - I hate paying $15 and have a salad that barely fills me up so I was skeptical about this place. But the salmon was very flavourful and went great with the other ingredients. The box had some pickled onions, spinach, brown rice, avocado, etc. The dressing was a Siracha vinegrette - it was ok and kinda subtle which was nice.

The service is ok, they don't take cash which is really weird. Price is on the high side but if the salad is healthy and fills me up then it's worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"I read the reviews from the other IQ locations and heard people raving about their salads. Coincidentally this location in particular just opened not long ago, so I decided to give it a try for the first time. I got the C++ salad, for $12. 

I thought people were exaggerating in their reviews about how good it was...but clearly they aren't. I saw one girl write about her feeling 'clean' after eating it and I'm like wtf - but i completely know what she means now lol. I got that same feeling - how? I don't know. but you do. 

When i first got the salad box, i was disappointed because it seemed like i paid for some overpriced small salad. but after i finished it, i completely agree that it may seem small, but it's actually very filling. But keep in mind I got the C++ salad which had chicken in it - not sure how filling the meatless salads are. 

One thing i really liked was that they default put dressing on the side for you, so you can pour as much or as little as you like. the dressing is really good - its a dijon mustard salad dressing. it complements the salad really well and improves your appetite due to its sour / tangy taste. 

One other thing i really liked was that they source everything locally - and they are proud of this. you can see them displaying where in ontario they got the mustard, the cabbage, etc. great way to support local farmers and businesses. 

their shop is super cute and this location has little nooks for people to sit/eat. i think i saw 2-3 tables, but no more. also love how they have a two level bench for people to chill on while waiting for their food. def helps seeing how i noticed sometimes they have line-ups out the door. 

i will make sure to try their baked desserts or drinks next time - they do look expensive, but i have a feeling it's worth it. one thing that caught my eye was the sweet potato brownie?

**tip: they are cashless, so make sure you have cards on you for paying."}
{"text":"pretty impressed  4.5 surprised there isnt as many reviews as this is a popular lunch spot in yhe biz district.  i ordered the salmon witj oniom or ginger not sure what it was but absolutely delicious.  highly recommend for a healthy meal.  prices was alright nothing to scream and shout about.  but good eats none the less."}
{"text":"Efficient service and quick preparation. Fresh ingredients and just the right size proportions (as opposed to American \"here's a trough of greens for you with a gallon of dressing--now go be healthy!\"). But holy HECK was it expensive. Sadly, I think no more so than other less healthy or fresh options would have been as well.  Moral of the story: Don't get hungry in Toronto unless you are rich."}
{"text":"I had a delicious sounding meal (tofu quinoa with avocado, broccoli, and other mixed veggies). The problem was the lack of dressing (for which they charge extra even though there is not enough in the first place) and the uncooked broccoli (tough to digest). Overall, the meal was very plain and it set me back $11. Nevertheless, their gluten-free, sugar-free, vegan desserts are wonderful as are their cold pressed teas of various flavors. Still expensive though (brownie = $4.50 or something like that). I guess they charge the work crowd for convenience."}
{"text":"I often go to this location to fulfil my weekend cravings for healthy takeout options. The place is pretty quiet on the weekends. There is enough space to sit and enjoy your meal and hang out with friends or family. 

The service has always been consistently awesome. Everyone that works here is very friendly and helpful as well as incredibly efficient. The restaurant has a pretty decent range of healthy offerings including small, sweet and savoury snacks to large meal boxes or smoothies. My personal favourite snacks are the sprout & trout (very light but pricey), as well as the incredible CRACK CUP which looks like a giant reese's peanut butter cup but does not taste like one. It is filled with dates, chocolate, and nuts and it is definitely one of my favourite desserts. I have also tried the raw cacao & almond smoothie which is a sweet, light, and refreshing beverage made with almond butter, almond milk, bananas, and raw cacao. 

My favourite meal box is cobb off guard which has goat cheese, cranberries, chicken, and onions. I find this box is lighter than other box options but very tasty! When I am looking for something heavier, I often order the sparta box which consists of your choice of grains (which can also be replaced by greens), chicken, onions, feta, and tomatoes. 

All boxes were filled with fresh ingredients and were of a good sized portion. You can add any ingredient to your box (for an extra cost) as well as make substitutions for grains vs greens or vice versa. This place is a good option if you are in the area and looking for a healthier alternative for your next meal."}
{"text":"Ordered the Apple Cobb Salad. Love the sauce that came with it. A bit of spiciness in the salad makes a good blend with the vegetable. The portion was good enough. 50% of spinach, 25% chicken and apple and the rest are the other vegetable. Service was really fast, probably took 5 to 8 mins max."}
{"text":"A trendy and modern place for a healthy lunch or a cup of coffee!
I had the Lima and it's really yummy. Every ingredients went so well with one another. Service was quick and not crowded at 11am on a weekday."}
{"text":"Loved my recent iQ experience.  Had the Blueberry Crunch quinoa box and a freshly squeezed  grapefruit juice. 

The Blueberry Crunch had grilled chicken, blueberries, feta and whole bunch of other stuff on a bed of quinoa.  All the ingredients were super fresh and well-prepared.  Juicy chicken; plump, enormous blueberries, fluffy quinoa, crunchy nuts...the list goes on.  The grapefruit juice was also delicious.  They told me they just finished squeezing it and it tasted like it. 

Service was friendly, polite and quick.  I found the food court it was in to be quite comfortable.  It was well lit with nice seating, making for a good venue to enjoy my tasty lunchbox.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My go to place for health food, I've tried a few different combos but Lima is my favorite as all the ingredients go well together and you get some spice too!

Located in the food court of the TD Building, come during off hours or you'll be in a super long line."}
{"text":"My go to place for health food, I've tried a few different combos but Lima is my favorite as all the ingredients go well together and you get some spice too!

A great place in the summer as they have patio seating although it's in between large buildings unfortunately so don't get sun."}
{"text":"If you're in the financial district after 7PM on weekdays and craving a solid vegan meal (or smoothie or treats), check out IQ! They're open later than K&K in the PATH, so perfect for late dinners and going back to the office. Here you can find breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks as smoothies, bowls, energy bites, oatmeal, etc. Many options are vegan, but not all. All nutritional info can be easily found on their website Partner knew that I have a sweet tooth so brought me home the vegan breakfast cookie, which is a very decent size, not nauseatingly sweet, and is filled with healthy ingredients including goji berries, carrots, and various seeds. It tastes like a less sweet version of a carrot cake, so some may find it bland but I thought it was much more wholesome than some of the way sweeter vegan cookies at K&K, and doesn't leave you with a sugar high afterwards :)"}
{"text":"Best healthy food in the city. I freaking love it here. Not as much as I love cheeseburgers and stuff like that, but if I want to eat something healthy... This is my top spot. It's like kupfert and Kim + meat."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience and meal here.

Stopped in before an event at the ACC with my momma bear for a quick, healthy bite. I got the spicy salmon salad (bowl?) and my mom got the sparta option along with a hot tea. Ingredients were super fresh, very tasty and pretty reasonably priced (about $30 for two meals with two beverages).

Would absolutely return if in the area and recommend if you are looking for something yummy and not super bad for you too ;)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to grab lunch to go, and now they have this new location in FCP! As per usual I did my order online and totally customized my box to my liking. This way you skip the 30 minute lineup and don't waste your lunch hour. I always get the tempah because it is the most amazing tempah I have ever had. I love getting their seasonal boxes so I can try the new fusion of flavours! 
It is super convenient, whole foods, dressing on the side so you can determine how much you want on it. The portions are generous and they have delicious desserts as well - crack cup is a must try. 
At one time I was quite mad at them for discontinuing my fav box but they've won me back and then some. I have even walked 20 minutes (one way) just because I had a craving for IQ Food so that should really tell you something."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to healthy lunch place to grab a bite. My favourite is Lima and I like to switch toppings around to keep it interesting. Regular toppings can be substituted with others like chickpeas and something like extra jalape√±os is no extra charge. I had the mission chicken at first and did not like that at all but am quite happy I gave iQ another go. It gets extremely busy around noon when the offices are on a lunch break so order online before hand or go a bit early or later during the day."}
{"text":"I've  become addicted to this place.  I stick to 2 lunch boxes. 1-  the Saam and the 2- Grilled chicken (I forget the name). I have to say, hands down to this place. The food is super healthy and you feel good after eating it. I come here once or twice a week now. I hope it never changes. Conclusion: the different layers of flavor burst in your mouth and the food is super yummy!"}
{"text":"I like this place and I've been quite a number of times. You get healthy and fresh food in a few minutes. So far, so good.

Only thing is the girl who takes orders (brown hair, shoulder length, doesn't wear a bra) tries to be cool and semi-ignores you, leaves you to wait for no reason, except that she wants to.. Only gives minimal communication. Does she think she's really cool? Not sure. 

Often you get them look at you then look away without saying anything while you're waiting quite a few minutes.

Could do with improving the service of the people who take orders and telling them they're not really actually cool and hipster, which is what they seem to think."}
{"text":"My go-to item from here is Peaches and Greens smoothie! It is absolutely addicting (and super-healthy as a bonus!) 

Their lentil soup was bomb too! Filling and guilt-free! 

I am very impressed by the food selections there as well as snacks and coffees. This place is perfect when you are on a detox and need something healthy and delicious.

I haven't tried their hot boxes yet but heard only great things!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place!!! Fresh food and smoothies and teas and espressos. My dream!

I had the Blue Magic smoothie which was delicious but I would've preferred a bit less almond butter in it. I also had the lentil soup which was piping hot and totally hit the spot. Finally, the star of the meal, which was the Apple Cobb salad. It was divine.  It has chicken, apple, cheese and other goodies. I finished the meal off with a chocolate brownie, which is very good and very chocolate-ty but after a couple of bites, it became too chocolate-ty for me and I had to put it away (and I'm a chocolate fiend!!!!). All in all, a great meal. The portion sizes don't seem big at first but I was very, very full (and only got through half the smoothie).  

I will be back!

I wish it opened a tad bit earlier so I can grab a smoothie bowl for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"I havent had solid food here yet but only because I tried their smoothie the first time and got hooked. My friend had their lunch boxes and claims that she feels great after it and that it's actually yummy. Their blueberry smoothie and their almond smoothie is very filling and delicious. It's a good place to get healthy lunch. But they only take cards, no cash!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try out this place because of the average 4 stars review. Honestly very shock of how much I didn't like this place. 

I ordered sababa, which is the box that comes with cauliflower. I'm surprised how much it costs, over $13 after tax. But oddly as a main ingredient, there's only few small pieces of cauliflowers. Also I didn't like their homemade salad dressing.

The build-in kale is $2.21, even I didn't want it, but I didn't know I can get rid of it and the box would be $2.21 cheaper. 

The ambience is quite off too. Seems to be a place with nice and high-end deco but also weird music playing at the background.

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan. Never a bad experience. Havent read the reviews but I'm sure someone has mentioned the lineup at lunch. Yes, its long; but it also moves relatively quick. There are at least 6-8 staff that make the boxed lunches and three counter staff processing orders. This place is a well-oiled machine.

Looking for healthy? Dont mind spending a few extra buck? For $12-14  you get a brilliant meal, fresh with lots of unique extras."}
{"text":"Great presentation and good quality fast food. If you need a quick, healthy alternative, then this is a good choice. It can get a little pricey and the portions are smaller than at other similar eateries."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE !! The people there are amazing! The food is also amazing. It's a healthy box with a mix of veggies, meat and a base of quinoa. Their ingredients are fresh and I love the amount of cheese they gave us (yummy!)

You can help yourself to the water jug. It's a very aesthetically pleasing and  calming place to eat brunch and talk with friends."}
{"text":"I stayed around the corner from iQ during a recent business trip and I ate there 3 times but wish that I had gone there more.  I often think of Lima and wished that there was an iQ in San Francisco. The food was always fresh, tasty and filling.

The line was always super long during lunch but it actually went really quick so don't worry if you are way in the back of the line."}
{"text":"I love iQ Food and am PUMPED about the new King St West location since it's so close to home. They offer all their nutritional info online and you can customize your bowls to your needs. Healthy and delicious.

Everything it made really quickly so getting take-out from here is awesome. If you're really short on time you can order through Ritual and pick it up"}
{"text":"Excellent burrito bowl. The sauce by itself is very tangy like hot sauce, but when tossed in salad, it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Oh boy, this place is pricey. If you want to spend over $10 on lunch you have to wait 30 minutes in line for, this place is for you. I've visited the iQ location in the PATH (TD food court), and each time I visit, the line gets longer and longer (although, to be fair, each time I've visited was around 11:30 AM, when the lunch rush begins). I've ordered: a) the Lima ($11.26, including tax), and b) the Spicy Salmon ($13.75, including tax). I'm told you can order online and pick up your box as the more efficient way of ordering, so I suppose that's one way to curb the long wait. 

The food is quite good, but nothing spectacular. For its price point, I was hoping for more. The Lima had a good kick to it, and the pickled onions in the Spicy Salmon gave the meal some life - although the one tiny piece of salmon in the sea of greens and brown rice was very disappointing (really, I had to squint and look twice before I even found the salmon, and for a box over $10, I'd like to think size wouldn't be an issue...). 

To be honest, with all the options in the PATH, I'd rather spend my $ elsewhere, particularly with salad I found merely average, a price point that didn't match the quality I found in my own orders, and the not-so-enjoyable experience getting my food in the first place (wading through the crowds, long waits, etc)."}
{"text":"My bosses and I ordered from this location via Hurrier on a Tuesday evening around 6:30 PM. Unfortunately, the experience wasn't great. As per my other in-person visits to iQ in the past, the overall product had potential for greatness but, when considering the experience in the aggregate (including price point and value), it was very sloppily put together and left us sorely lacking.

We ordered 2 Limas and 2 Spicy Salmons with very diet-specific requests on the Hurrier order (i.e. quinoa to replace the brown rice in the Spicy Salmons, and no avocado in the Limas). While the Limas were fine, the Spicy Salmons came with, wouldn't you know it, brown rice - something that wasn't part of anyone's diet. There were no napkins in the delivery bag, cutlery haphazardly thrown in, boxes slightly ripped at the edges and sloppily put together. The boxes also weren't labelled, so we had no idea which order was which, and which order belonged to whom. 

Considering the price point, it was a really disappointing experience. The ingredients were indeed fresh, but the portion size was also quite small - overall, it isn't the best salad you can get in the Financial District. You can take your money and put it elsewhere, if you're looking for value, quality, and above sub-standard service. 

For 4 meals, we paid around $62 (included any Hurrier fees, for those ordering through the app)."}
{"text":"Famished at lunch, I wanted something hearty and still healthy.  iQ looked like a winner.

I ordered the Lima Hotbox with quinoa.  It came with quinoa, aged white cheddar, grape tomatoes, avocados, beans, corn, grille chicken and a chili cilantro lime sauce.  It was beautifully put together and I love the colors, but does it taste as good as it looked?  Yes, this is a winner indeed!"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Location: 5/5

The fresh food revolution is here. Some of the most nutritious \"fast food\" I've ever encountered! Fresh, flavourful, and packed full of the most celebrated super foods (quinoa, avocado, and salmon are menu staples) - their meal boxes are a must try! I got the lima box that is highly recommended and I was not disappointed (be careful with the hot sauce though)! They offer smoothies and cold press juices as well made from produce sourced from local farms for the freshest ingredients. The store gives off a very effortlessly cool vibe with its tiling, blonde wood accents, and Edison bulbs. Even though I went during the weekday lunch rush, our order was filled very quickly and we were able to nab a table to sit."}
{"text":"I went here once about a year and a half ago and was quite impressed with the Lima box. I just had it again today for the 2nd time, and I don't know what happened in the past 2 years, but I was not impressed with my box at all. 

The red sauce they used tasted really synthetic, and they put way too much of it on. It overpowered the dish with its less than stellar taste. Also, the cheese they used was extremely low quality. Really salty with bad texture. I understand that cheese is expensive, but to be honest, it was so bad that the dish would have been better with no cheese at all.

Generally speaking, the dish didn't taste fresh at all. It had this slightly stale, languid taste that made it seem like the box had been sitting out for a few hours beforehand. I usually bring my lunch, and this just goes to show why it's better to make these types of salad dishes yourself. Cheaper, healthier and control over the ingredients."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Excellent food. Cashier gave me attitude when I asked for a cookie and she was texting while I was waiting for her to give me change. Please fire this girl! Otherwise everyone should try the ginger and molasses cookie!"}
{"text":"If I worked downtown regularly then I would eat at this place once a week. It's in the FCP food court.

Today I had the $13 beet salad. This is one of the best meal salads I have ever had: delicious, highly nutritious and filling. It was worth every penny.

I also purchased an interesting sounding sweet potato brownie for later. Ingredients did not appear to include obvious flours."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and my go-to is the Lima bowl which comes with oven roasted chicken, corn, black beans, grape tomatoes, avocado, aged white cheddar, jalape√±os, pickled cabbage, cilantro, and brown rice. They give hot sauce on the side which I usually drizzle half on top as it's quite spicy! I also add sweet potatoes and free run eggs (hard boiled) which cost a bit more. I've found that the ingredients are fresh whenever I go. I had the bowl without the add-ons before and it's still delicious, filling and colourful! There's a lot of different textures in the bowl so the taste is unique in every bite. 

I'll be back to try more things on the menu. If you're looking for a healthy meal in downtown, you should definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Okay so the gist of this downtown lunchtime healthy food staple is seasonality and sustainability. So when you come here your colon will thank you and you will find the menu creative and full of interesting combos. On the downside your wallet will not thank you. It's expensive for a casual lunch hour at work. If you are budget conscious, I would only come here for their hot drinks and soups when you are needing nutrition to nurse a cold/flu. There is a juicery beside them with juice shots containing oil of oregano, etc... that are also useful for getting your immune system back on track."}
{"text":"Don't know this location. Too bad you can't delete a wrongly entered review."}
{"text":"Smoothies are so good, interesting in taste, too. Loved my arugula salad, with baked sweet potato and avocado, delicious. Will keep going back as long as I'm in Toronto. All staff are all very nice."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the care they put in the food. They care the food and they care their customers. They are opening up a new one and I can't wait to go have the IQ awesomeness there."}
{"text":"Who told these guys that healthy food was allowed to be this delicious?? And this unique?? well whoever did...it seems to be working quite well because they are busy as hell. But it's alright because they have an amazing ordering/paying system that keeps the line moving!"}
{"text":"The hipster vibes are strong with this one.

Average rating due to high price point. I arrived for lunch on Saturday afternoon and managed to get a seat with guests (can't imagine how busy this place must be on weekdays). Rustic/industrial themed interior is as Liberty Village as it gets, but I won't hold that against them.

I'm skeptical about the freshness of the ingredients used here. The roast chicken in my salad was definitely on its way to a better place (not in the danger zone yet, but decidedly stale), and the cream formed a thin skin on top of the coffee...hmmm. The staff seemed somewhat bemused by the sight when we asked for a fresh cup, so it made me wonder if they're used to that.

Portion sizes are decent and we left satisfied, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to return here again - it's a case of A+ idea, B for execution. I would go here again if the only other choices were fast food. On the plus side, the gender-neutral bathroom was sparkling clean."}
{"text":"This is a great healthy option for lunch or dinner within a few blocks of Union station. They have a nice patio area beside the street, so we opted to sit there since it seemed quite loud inside. Seems a lot of suits like to eat here for dinner before heading back to work. The orders came through quickly but I was expecting more vegetables in my Lima bowl. It was good, but the blue magic smoothie was overpowered with the taste of almond butter. It's quite pricey; remember you're paying for their rent in the financial district, which costs quite a bit more than rice and beans. 

Their theme of natural, organic, wholesome, Vegan, gluten free foods is nice, but wears a bit thin: for example, maple sugar seems pretty refined to me - how else can you account for a day of boiling tree sap into something so delicious? The point is - dessert doesn't need to be pure and healthy, and playing fast and loose with language doesn't make it \"better for you\" either.

The single bathroom is quite clean and spacious (good to know if you're carrying luggage with you)."}
{"text":"I have had IQ before, but an acquaintance and I went to this location near Bay & Wellington and I ordered the Lima, which is a good choice with its spicy sauce that one mixes in. The portion looks small, but is completely filling perhaps given its chicken and beans.

It does give one a healthy feeling. They make some allusions to sourcing sustainably (whatever that means) and having organic food, which sounds great.

Unfortunately they served our food in boxes even though we were dining in, which was disappointing because I know they do have bowls, but they never asked us. It is probably a good idea to mention it to them proactively if you prefer bowls over take-out cartons. Also, disappointingly their plastic cutlery broke on me as I was trying to dig into the food so they should either find a better supplier or switch to the real thing. At $12/salad prices they can afford it.

With that said, and as much as the food tastes and feels good, the place is so busy and so packed that I recommend to only those with patience. There is a rare patio, which is a good idea if you find seating and several stools inside.

Finally, they can accept online orders so choose that option in order to reduce waiting time."}
{"text":"Good coffee (Pilot roasters). Marzocco machine. Good prices. Fast service. Want: more fast breakfast options. Overall, great stop right outside Union Station."}
{"text":"First of all, this place made me feel a bit out of my element as I rarely hang out with suits.  However, this place is literally across the street from Deloitte and smack dab in the middle of the Financial District.  So be prepared...

To describe iQ, it's like the salad bar of Whole Foods, with already set dishes, you pick one, and it's even served in the same cardboard-type box with a compostable fork.

Lima (~$10) - Really delicious and it had a 'kick' with freshly chopped jalapenos and a spicy dressing.

I loved that the dressing was served on the side.  However, what needed improvement was that I wished that they labelled the garbage bins because I didn't know what was recyclable, compostable, etc.  Staff looked like Westcoast, granola lovin' hippies who dressed as though they work at MEC/Lululemon.

Good, fresh, fast eats, for cheaper than Whole Foods as the weight is quite substantial.  Great alternative if you're in the area/seeing a show at the Sony Centre!"}
{"text":"In Toronto on business, I ventured out for a vegan lunch and was thrilled to see so many options! I chose IQ by accident--I couldn't find the place I was looking for and found myself in a mall food court. I didn't recognize any of the chains (this being a foreign county and all) but am so glad I settled on IQ.  I had the peaches and green smoothie, which was only slightly sweet and bright green as the name would imply. I also ordered the 5-Star box, full of a variety of colors, textures, and flavors including quinoa, avocado, roasted broccoli, cashews and pepitas. It was a little on the pricey side for both, but I didn't mind. I wish my local mall had a spot for healthy options like this!"}
{"text":"You gotta go at 11:30 for a fighting chance to not wait 30 minutes to get your food. 

But its healthy and its good. my favorite is the lima. I always enjoy it and it makes me forget that i just waited 30 minutes for something im going to consume in 5."}
{"text":"my go to lunch spot...quality ingredients and just delish"}
{"text":"Super delicious. Spartan is my go to meal! Just wish their portions are bigger or have an option to order reg. & large size!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5.

I've been going to IQ for quite some time now. From experience I have not ventured far away from the Lima or Sparta as the other lunch boxes which I have tried were not very good. For $10 dollars a box it's a pretty solid choice for lunch however they have recently increased the price of all their menu items and I feel that the size of the portions has decreased with time as well.

What you can expect from the IQ if you get the Lima or Sparta is a well balanced lunch with your proteins and veggies that you probably should have and/or could have made at home for lunch for a lot cheaper. 

If your going to have IQ for lunch, 12:00PM is when the line is the longest so I would suggest waiting 15-30 minutes for a faster line queue."}
{"text":"Great salads,  coffee and baked goods! It's a little pricey but the ingredients and flavours more than make up for it,  and I love that they use locally sourced goods!"}
{"text":"I love their salad. It's so good even without the dressing. Healthy and good but a lil pricey."}
{"text":"personally, I couldn't eat this everyday (I'd need a burger after a while). also not sure it's quite as healthy as they claim (see Toronto Star article). the food here, however, is as fresh as you can possibly get. the flavor combinations are clever and tasty. IMO the boxes are good value and filling. the coffee and baked offerings are pleasantly good.

service is friendly and efficient. the decor is clean and inviting.

no complaints really. it's a competent restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend and i stopped in for a snack and to just chill and talk. Place was clean n i loved their sweet potato chocolate brownie. Deducted stars: (according to my friend) an employee kept glaring at my back every time he turned at my direction just coz i asked for something."}
{"text":"iQ is one of my to go lunch places in the financial district. The staff there are very welcoming and polite. There is always a long line up during lunch time; however, due to their exceptional customer service, the wait time is surprisingly short. 

I absolutely love the Lima lunch box. The chicken is incredibly moist, tender and full of flavor. All the ingredients compliment one another from the crunchy texture of the cabbage to the bold flavors of the jalapenos. I usually add an extra dollar to switch the brown rice for quinoa! Not only is the food good, it is presented beautifully. I love watching the staff make my lunch box from start to finish. Really neat experience!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I officially dub iQ Food on York St. as my favourite restaurant for lunch in Toronto. 
Let me give you 10 reasons why this restaurant is worth going gaga over: 

1. It's so refreshing and healthy. I often find that afternoons are when I have the lowest productivity and my drowsiness is frequently exacerbated by heavy lunches. I can personally testify that this will not be the case after eating iQ. 
2. The online ordering system is amazing. You pay via credit card and select a time you want to pick it up and it will always be on time. Just pop into the restaurant, and there you have your lunch.
3. Flexibility with portions and ingredients. You have so much agency over what you want to exclude/ add in. If you find that the lunch box is not filling enough, an additional $4 will give you ample amount of meat. 
4. They make tap water look cool. Upon ordering your lunchbox, they will immediately offer you a glass bottle of what looks like sparkling water (it's just filtered tap, but the illusion is pretty cool). 
5. It's so delicious. The Maple Greens, Lima and Glow are my personal favourites, but really try everything on the menu. Lima is good if you feel like getting chicken. I especially enjoy the sweet potato which gives the lunchbox a bit of a sweet taste. Glow is a quinoa lunchbox and is complemented with hummus. 
6. From what I can tell, the restaurant seems to be environmentally friendly. The lunchboxes and napkins are all made of recycled material. 
7. The free wifi game is strong. I really appreciate that. 
8. Reasonable, affordable prices. I can dine here for half of the days of the week and still manage not to go broke. All lunch boxes are around $8-$12, not bad for a delicious, healthy meal. 
9. Smart decor. I really love how they placed mirrors on the ceiling so that you can see all the ingredients they are adding in. It's aesthetic and at the same time extremely smart. You get to see how they are preparing the food. 
10. Amazing service, really approachable people. I've never had a bad experience dining here. All the servers are extremely friendly and make me feel right at home.

After dining here for at least 30 times now, I think I have perfected my order. Try out my favourite customized lunchbox: 

Customized Lima lunchbox: 
oven roasted chicken, spicy corn, black beans, grape tomatoes, avocado, aged white cheddar, jalape√±os, pickled cabbage, cilantro, lime juice, brown rice, hot sauce

{"text":"You may think salads/vegetable could not be substantial or filling; healthy food won't be delicious. However, IQ Food will change your mindset. 

Recently I am changing my lifestyle to be more healthy. IQ is very close to my office; I would go there to get my lunch after exercise. 

The menu is very simple and they listed all the ingredients on the board. At first I would wonder why people would pay over $10 for salad, but once I tried it I would understand why. The ingredients are very fresh, the proportion of each ingredient make a very balanced favour. I like they put the sauce on the side, and I usually put 1/3 of the sauce only since it is most of the sodium and sugar coming from. The meal indeed is filling and I don't need an afternoon snack. 

It worths to mention their coffee is very nice too. It was first introduced to me as a nice coffee place from my coworker who is an European coffee drinker."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the financial district, directly across Deloitte and equinox gym. Love everything about this place! They offer organic, healthy food and drink options, service is friendly, interior is modern and chic! 

I recommend getting the avocado toast. Amazing!!! Perfectly seasoned!!! Avocado, chilli flakes, cilantro and line are on sprouted toast. The big red smoothie bowl is amazing as well!!! It's a mix of veggies and fruit topped with granola, coconut and nuts. I couldn't even taste the spinach!!! They offer loads of drink options, from freshly squeezed juices to kombucha and tea! Coffee is a bit on the lighter side though so make sure to get an extra shot of espresso in your drink! 

Their lunch boxes are spectacular as well!!! You can literally see each ingredient and everything is so fresh and light! Had the number one option, which was a bit of a Mexican style. Didn't even have to ask for jalape√±os or hot sauce cause it was already included on top. 

They offer free wi-fi and outlets are easily accessible everywhere, definitely a great place to get some work done or get some reading in!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars better than your average fast food spot but you do pay a lot for it

Fast food doesn't have to a heavy grease bomb as I experienced at iQ food.  I'm used to seeing them in the Finance core but it was nice to have them outside of banking area.

This particular location is not very big but it does have a few tables for you to use.  I will admit that I like iQ because it's always bustling with a lot of well trained staff.  This location is no different.  I easily counted 5 people working here and no one was just standing around.  They were all busy making the orders coming in via apps or in the line up.  I can imagine this place getting crowded quickly during the lunch.  We did arrive after the lunch time to grab a few bites so it wasn't too busy.

The menu is fairly simple with salads, bowls, smoothies, and toasts.  They also have some baked goods available. In addition to their listed salads, you can customize to what you'd like as well.  Prices are not cheap... for a salad it starts up as a vegan salad at $12 but add on any meat like chicken and it jumps up to $16 for a take out salad.

Kale Caesar salad with extra chicken - I have to admit that they really shoved as much ingredients into the box.  When I opened it, it was clearly packed up the top.  I can see a lot of baby kale, large slices of Parmesan cheese, grape tomatoes, seeds, and chickpeas.  Nothing looked wilted and they all seem fresh and not pre-cut in some off site location.  I do like how this is not your typical caesar and it was quite flavourful.  Expensive for $16? absolutely but you're also eating wholesome vegetables and not a processed pre-made baked good.  4/5

Mr. Peanut smoothie - This was really rich and thick... made with peanut butter, banana, dates, almond milk and cocoa, you gotta love peanuts cause every sip is like liquid peanut butter.  It's lightly sweet so they didn't make this a sugary sip which I can appreciate.  With other shakes in the area being $8, I felt this wasn't outrageous but definitely up there in price.  4/5

Overall, it's a great alternative to other fast food spots on Queen St West.  You can feel good eating this and not have the sugar crashes or heavy feeling in the pit of your stomache.  Not only do you feel lighter after eating this, so does your wallet.  The meal came up to $24 in total... pricey absolutely but I like feeling light around my waist as well."}
{"text":"Decent salads but could be a better size and quality for the price they're charging. I ate the Spicy Salmon ($12) which was overall tasty and I appreciated the good ratio of meat, veggies, and carbs. I also liked that the dressing was in a separate container but it could be because it was delivery. I found the portion to be pretty small though and was hungry again soon after. Overall, it's a healthier choice than many other food court offerings but for a similar price point, there are fresher, more filling and more interesting salads elsewhere."}
{"text":"Would give more than 2 stars since I think the quality of their boxes is relatively good compared to other fast options, but they missed giving me the free run hard boiled egg in the Spring Market Bowl (which is the main reason I wanted that bowl). Didn't find out until I was back at the office and by then it was too late. Not happy."}
{"text":"I like IQ  and have enjoyed the Wellington location. Unfortunately, the service at this York location is substandard, sloppy;  simply not on par with the quality/ethos of the food.  

Manager:  please share with your staff that your food is great but service needs to be too!  
The downtown crowd expect both at this price point."}
{"text":"This place is right in my work building at 18 York PWC building. The food is healthy here. I usually order here st least once a week. I usually get the Lima box which has rice, red cabbage, cherry tomatoes, avocados, white cheese and chicken or the salmon box is pretty good as well. It's a bit pricy but very tasty and healthy.  There's locations everywhere.  This place gets packed after 11:45am.  Usually when I want to not wait in line I get my food at 11:30.   I was told of you go around 2 pm they're trying to get rid of the food so your get bigger portions. When you go during rush hour the portions are smaller."}
{"text":"Always a great (albeit expensive) lunch (that takes a long time). 

I work not far from this location, but despite the proximity I rarely end up eating here because the lineup and wait for food can last up to 15 minutes, and at lunch, I don't want to just stand around. 

Having said that, for what its worth, I really believe this is the best, healthfullest and most delicious food you can get in the path. Their creations are delicious, as well as healthy, and I feel GOOD (not exhausted and tired) after finishing a box for lunch. 

Strong reccommendation on a day you have a little leeway in your lunch hour."}
{"text":"IQ was delicious! They were efficient during lunch rush and I had the spicy salmon box.  Loved every bit of it. I left a star out because I've gone back 3 times and their salmon was different in portion every time. Happy when I get a bigger piece because I'm paying $15 for it but disappointed when I got a very small strip of it because I was paying $15 for it...  I am also not a fan of it being a cashless place but I guess it helps with the till being more accurate at the end of the day."}
{"text":"I generally veer towards IQ when I don't bring a lunch to work.

The boxes seems small but the food is hearty and quality, and I think the best bang for your buck in the area.

The price for a box is around $11 and fills you up with a healthy array of proteins, grains and veggies.

My fav is the Lima box (black beans, chicken, corn, brown rice, avocado...) and the seasonal Sababa box (roasted cauliflower)."}
{"text":"The lunch lines are always long whether it's in person or online. If you want to place your order online and pick up right away, it's not possible. To pick up at a time you want, you'll have to order it early in the morning. If you order at around noon, you'll need to wait 40min before you can pick up. Waiting in person will take roughly 20min.

However, the salads are amazing. My favorite dressing is honey dijon and you can swap in any kind of dressing without charge. Be careful if you want to swap out brown rice with quinoa because that'll cost you $2 - yikes. This is also the reason I'm docking a star. 

I'm loving the maple greens salad right now - the squash is such a great addition. The salmon salad is alright, but I'm not a fan of how they make their salmon. If you want a piece of salmon, I suggest going to Pumperknickel. The best thing is that the boxes will last you till dinner!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Since my office is across the street this is pretty much my cafeteria. Sure there are days where I want to have a few drinks and eat delicious comfort food but there are some days where all I want to eat is kale and quinoa and I will happily pay a premium for a place that will cut up raw vegetables and throw it in a box over a bed of grains and leaves. iQ is the place for that and I love love love their food. The lovely people will even grill a piece of salmon for you. Everything is so great here. All of their boxes are delicious and it just makes life so easy. 

The only problem is there isn't really that much space to sit since most people order their food and take it to go (understandably so as we are in the financial district). And this also means service is meant to be fast, not exceptional. Again understandable so no huge complaints here. 

I wish there was an iQ beside my house because I would order dinner from there everyday and be a happy, healthy camper."}
{"text":"I've come twice for a take-out lunch and tried the salads. On my first visit I gave the B3 a try. This salad has a great mix of a little bit of everything on a bed of kale. Overall I was really impressed. The prices here aren't too bad either. They're slightly more premium than most salad places.

On my second visit I tried the Siracha Cobb at the suggestion of a co-worker. I also grabbed the pineapple mint juice. The cobb was less than impressive. I think my problem was that I let myself succumb to the hype of my coworker. The salad was good, but not as good as explained, nor as good as the B3. The pineapple juice was also a letdown. I couldn't taste any mint whatsoever.

They're really trying to promote the fact that they're now open early in the morning. My two visits were weeks apart and both times I got a coupon for a free hot beverage to be used before lunch."}
{"text":"The service is not particularly friendly but it's efficient. Staff and clientele tend towards tragically hip. But who cares, the food is fresh, \"clean\" and with tons of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options. I had fresh pineapple juice and a GF brownie made with sweet potatoes that was moist, rich and tasted of very dark chocolate tbut not very sweet - perfection. I also tried the Lima box (chicken, avocado, beans, pickled cabbage, tomatoes, brown rice, spicy sauce) - I'd come back here in a second! My taste buds were surprised and delighted by the different flavors and textures. They offer free wifi in a very bright, spotlessly clean and modern space that is not typical of the fast food model. It's not cheap but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.. They changed the date and oat cookies to a much much smaller version for the same price. No longer worth it. Tear tear"}
{"text":"During my one month stay in Toronto, I cannot count the number of times that I came to iQ. I've tried most of the bowls on the menu, and I can't say that I haven't liked any one of them. 

My favorite is the Blueberry Crunch with quinoa, primarily because of the perfect way every ingredient mixes together. The green apple slices add a nice crunch, while the blueberries add a great sweetness. The grilled chicken pairs surprisingly well with the fruit, and the feta cheese and mint just ties it all together. My next go-to is the Cobb Off-Guard, which is a healthier play on a Cobb salad. The spinach is the salad base, and it's then topped with chicken, roasted pecans, cranberries, goat cheese, and pickled onions. Each of the ingredients just make up the perfect bite, particularly the creamy goat cheese. I would also recommend the Bellwoods for something a little different. Don't get turned off by the grapes because it actually contrasts really well with the yogurt curry sauce and the bowl as a whole! 

For a little something extra, the lentil soup is very clean-tasting with just lentils and spices to warm your stomach. Their energy balls, or raw truffles, are also a great pick-me-up for the middle of the afternoon. If I lived in Toronto, I'd probably eat iQ all day every day, but until then I'll be waiting for something similar in the US!"}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it! My sister has a crazy bad allergy and this is one of the few places in the neighborhood to serve her with no issues.  Super friendly, a bit pricey but worth it if you suffer allergies in the financial core."}
{"text":"iQ Food serves offers a wide array of clean, delicious, thoughtful food. The menu consists of a comprehensive array of local ingredients. Items offered are fluid, they varies based on season. List of ingredients are available at request. 

I had the \"Glow\" ($8.85+tax). Glow is comprised of quinoa, kale, avocado, pickled cabbage, shredded carrots, sweet potato (substituted it with almonds), hummus and lemon vinaigrette (substitute with creamy Dijon vinaigrette). I love the acidity of the Dijon dressing. It's strong on its own, but as a dressing, it adds a level complexity to the salad. The pickled cabbage complimented the hummus. The combination did not disappoint. 

The staff was helpful and accommodated my strange detox dietary needs. I will definitely visit again, since I will be on this detox for another painful two weeks. iQ Foods made it a lot more bearable!"}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch on Friday; had a great time. I was in and out in 5 minutes, and enjoyed the modern design. The food was great, although the paper box provided was a little bit deep and awkward to eat around. The food was great after stirring it up, and was evidently very healthy."}
{"text":"I have come here  a couple of times for the sweet potato brownie. I always bring different friends to try the brownies with me.  About a year or two ago   One of my friends saw  fresh sweet potato brownies being pulled out and requested one of those instead of what was on display.  The employee started glaring at my friend when  was getting his money to pay for his brownie .  He kept glaring at my friend throughout our stay at IQ  while we chatted and charged our phones.  This is why the rating is so low, otherwise this IQ location is very clean with some cool health products . The Sweet Potato Brownies are  a must try, and If you see fresh ones coming out, request those as brownies fresh out of the oven are preferred to those at room temperature."}
{"text":"Tired of Starbucks for coffee at Southcore Financial Center? iQ Food is just a few steps away. iQ has only a few coffee choices, including lattes, americano mistos, flat whites, etc, but the coffee that they produce is excellent. It generally takes several minutes for the coffee to be made, so iQ is not recommended if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Great food, consistently good quality, attentive and efficient service. Best option for foodcourt."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my healthy-eating friends. I like the food here. For around 10 dollars, you got a salad with a piece of meat. I am not vegan and I want meat. The salad is incredible tasty. I don't usually choose to eat raw food or salad for lunch, but I would not mind eating here.
Tip: order online during rush hours
My favourite: lima and spicy salmon"}
{"text":"So healthy. Got the Lima Chicken. It was very flavourful and spicy - exactly what I wanted. There was corn, candy tomatoes, cheese, Sriracha, jalape√±os, avocado, and a few other garnishes all on a bed of rice and some cheese to give it that extra flavour. It was so good.

Also had a molasses cookie, which was so great.

Service was great and atmosphere was awesome. Will definitely be coming back to try more of the menu!

{"text":"Tasty salads and coffee! I love how they have seasonal boxes featuring local ingredients which, when combined expertly together, taste amazing. The boxes themselves cost less than $15 (still a bit pricey) and service is pretty quick and efficient. I've only gone to this location as it is the only one open on the weekends. Both times it's been pretty quiet. 

The last time I was here I ordered the 100k box! I think one of my fave seasonal boxes. All the ingredients went so well together and it was a great healthy meal that didn't feel heavy on a hot summer's day. Will be back for more if I'm around the area."}
