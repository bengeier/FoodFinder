{"text":"I was excited about trying Jessie's due to the number of positive reviews on Yelp and other websites.  I'd like to say the staff were extremely friendly and that was a wonderful positive about this place.  I ordered the souvlaki plate as this seemed to be a popular choice.  The positives were that the food was fresh and the salad dressing was amazing.  I found the meat to be over cooked and dry, difficult to even cut through with a knife.  The majority of the plate was filled with rice and very little meat.  At $14/plate I felt the amount of meat was insufficient.  I really wanted to enjoy it but overall I would not recommend due to the value for money.  A+++ to the staff though, they were extremely pleasant and hence a 3 star review."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with coworkers because they kept talking about how good the food is. So I had to try it and I was very happy with what I received.

I ordered the small chicken souvlaki. It was a good size for a small, but a little pricey. The total with a can of pop with 18.70. Usually when I go to a Greek place I'm use to paying $12-13. 

The chicken was cooked perfectly and so was the rice.

Overall I would go back, it was great for lunch. Call ahead though because it can get really busy. 

Only downside other than it's a little pricey is that that don't have their menu post online anywhere. No website. Nothing. So you literally have to go there unless you memorized the menu to know what's on special that day or even on the menu.

Will update when I try more food. Until than happy eats."}
{"text":"Love Jessie's! Great place for a breakfast or a lunch, very generous portions. There is some seating if you wish to eat in, but tight for space. Owners are pleasant and charming. If you go on a Wednesday, make sure you try the brownies, very tasty."}
{"text":"Everyone at work raves about this place. Very busy at lunch time, I assume 95% of their business is between 12-2 pm as there is not many good options in the area within walking distance of all the companies. Jessie's totally takes advantage of this, as a burger and fries cost $13.50. Why is a caf√©/diner charging $3.99 for fries and $8.87 for a burger. Odd! They had roast beef with salad for $15.60 as a lunch special. The burger was nothing special, they do make them to your liking, however I asked for tomato lettuce and mayo and got onions tomato lettuce ketsup and mustard. Yuck! I hate mustard. So not only did it seem overpriced to me, I got a burger I tossed half way through because I personally do not like mustard. Fries are salted and vinegary which were ok. I gave one star because you can not give 0.

Very disappointed, they are charging prices like the keg milestones and Kelsey's at lunch, for take out? Still: odd experience to me. 

*** Since someone messaged and said I don't know what I'm talking about and hardly go out: The Keg, Milestones and Kelsey's all have lunch menus that all their burgers are under $20, so I will stand by my statement and say for a cafe to serve a burger at $13.50 is just plain silly and a mega rip - ps see my review on the keg mansion and keg Montreal. ***

You can get a cookie for $2.49. Rice and salad for $10. What an odd combination lol

Anyway if u like paying too much for your lunch, go here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hidden in an industrial area. If no one told me about this place, I will probably never come here. My colleague drove me here for lunch. Surprisingly, the line was out of the door. I assumed this place is got to be good. We had waited for almost 25 mins to get our orders. Before I share the review of my order, I have to highlight on the hygiene of the place. While we were waiting in line, I saw a cockroach running on the counter. At a glance, I thought it was just a bug. However, after it was quickly crawling on the surface of the counter for roughly 5 sec, I am certain that it was a big roach. 

The servers know my colleague since he has been here for several times. However, my colleague told me that their attitude today was off and it was short staffed. After I told him about the roach, he was shocked. Interestingly, he used to come with another co-worker together, and he said he spotted a bug another day in the restaurant. Because the bug was crawling fast and the server picked it up quickly, he couldn't identify the type of the bug. Therefore, today's incident was not rare. 

Anyway, I was brave and strong enough to try my chicken breast plate. It tastes good but it is not gonna overcome the issue of the cockroaches."}
{"text":"The food is good but it's not the best value. Ordered a small souflaki plate for lunch, came to $13.44 with tax.  Meat was a bit dried out, not the best.

I've eaten here before and I Iike their side salad options, there is a bean, beet, and green salads. The portions are quite generous and there are daily specials. Today it was meatloaf."}
{"text":"Wow! Some of the freshest ingredients in the area. A family run Jem. I travel 20 minutes to go here for lunch and always worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Two minutes to Hersey Center. Great place to get breakfast and lunch.  They accommodated with everything we asked for and our kids are very picky. 
Food was very fresh and the owners were amazing. 
Thank you for making us feel at home.

{"text":"I have been going to Jessie's on Matheson for nearly 15 years. This place is an absolute Mississauga classic.

An FYI for everyone reading this: this place is strictly a lunch style diner. It is not a restaurant where you bring people you are trying to impress. Its a place to go grab a lunch made with REAL ingredients served up by Chris and his great staff.

There is a reason that this place always has a line up out the door around 12pm- the food is fantastic. If they have a special on, get it. If they have clam chowder, get a small one to go.

It is not cheap to eat here. And for that reason it is 4 stars- not 5. The best thing you can get at Jessie's is their salad with their house dressing. I am not kidding when I say its the best salad dressing you'll find anywhere...its so freaking delicious.

It is $15/person to eat here no matter what you get. Thats just the way it is. But I'm happy to pay it because its a family run establishment by Chris and his food is of the highest quality.

Food 5/5 Pricing 3/5  Experience 5/5 every time"}
