{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We had been to this location under the past two owners and had better experiences. Unfortunately, there's not much good to say. Menu was very limited which would be ok if the food was exceptional. We were not impressed at all. Everything was very basic, not worth the prices. We were a party of 6 on a Friday night. Made reservations but they weren't ready for us when we arrived. There were only a handful of other tables but service was slow and inaccurate. When our checks finally came, those were wrong too. From start to finish, just a bad experience."}
{"text":"The chicken Parmesan was outstanding!  The staff was friendly and attentive.  One of the owners even stopped bye to see how I enjoyed my meal!  I will return to try the French bread pizza."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Friday at 7 and when I showed up they were not open. Why would you allow people to make reservations if your restaurant is not actually open. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, pretty decor and very clean. Good location. Satisfactory service. Average food (my $29 pork chop was extremely dry). Very small portions and pricey for what you get. The menu does not have a lot to offer. Went in early August and their website was not updated for their monthly menu changes (Still had Sept menu posted on 8/9/16, Very disappointing). Loved the original 21/82 restaurant, had high hopes when I saw the Grand Reopening. I really wanted to love this place. Disappointing to say the least. Don't think I'll go back to give it another try. There are so many other great places to eat in Cleveland's suburbs."}
{"text":"The menu is the same tired, old, bland food found at too many other restaurants in Brecksville. Sadly, Bistro 2182 is a far cry from the restaurant it followed. ."}
