{"text":"Put my timer on and it took 9 min 21 seconds to get a drink refill. Absolutely unacceptable in any establishment."}
{"text":"Funny how people are quick to judge others because of mistakes! We're human people get over yourselves!! If you were critiqued for every thing you did wrong at work I'm sure you wouldn't like it either. Things happen people get a life!!"}
{"text":"This is a great local bar to attend if you are in the area. Food is great. You are greeted promptly. Danielle was our bartender ! She was very sweet, attentive, and made great recommendations !"}
{"text":"I used to live being here, but the quality of service has gone down significantly. Our food used to come out in 15 minutes, not it takes at least 25-30... That's if they remember to put in our order. I'm sitting here with an empty beer and no food in front of me."}
{"text":"This was disappointing.  Many of my friends have told me this was the place to be, however the amount of attitude I recived from the waitress and the less then appealing food (which was over cooked and cold) made me never want to return."}
{"text":"Awesome bar to hang out at. various age groups, young and old and VERY reasonably priced. I'm there every Thurday for $1.00 tacos and cold cheap bottles of their finest Miller Light."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Amazing food and service every time I come in. Very attentive. Sara is bae."}
{"text":"Crabby server, slow service, understaffed. We arrived on a busy Saturday night for dinner. Waited a long while to get waited on and waitress was annoyed that we had started a bar tab. Food was decent but cranky waitress who seemed annoyed by our presence was a thumbs down"}
{"text":"Trivia on Tuesday nights starting at 8pm! The special of the night is also a burger and a pint for $5 with happy hour specials until 9pm! Come here and spend ten bucks and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar & restaurant - happy hour everyday til 9:00pm. Daily food specials are delish besides pretty much everything on the menu. Attentive service too!"}
{"text":"if i could give zero stars, i would. i have never in my life had more terrible service than i had here tonight. our server was jessica. and she was THE. FREAKING. WORST. we will never be back here again. this is unbelievable. i have never written a review like this before and i hate to bash local places, but clearly this girl cared about regulars/friends more than anyone else in the bar. the table next to us had 12-14 bottles on their table and we waited a half hour for our check. and she screwed it up. TWICE. ridiculous. get your crap together.  *edited for yelp as i didn't want to get deleted for swearing. see their facebook for a raunchier version..."}
{"text":"A co-worker told me about this place and how they have specials everyday of the week which sounded great. Walked in for the first time and did not get greeted and just sat ourselves. Waited a little while for someone to greet or even give us the menues.   Then came Leah... She was new on her first night .  We did not know the menu and she did a great job. She was very tentitive and made the experience worthwhile."}
{"text":"I live right by this place, and it's the only reason I come here. The service is terrible and seems to be worse every time I come back. They are severely understaffed - one bartender for the whole place, including all the tables. The food is good but nothing special. Often you can't get the celery and ranch you asked for to go with your wings, and you wait 15 minutes for another beer. Unless you're local and this is the most convenient place to go, it's not worth coming here."}
{"text":"Good local place, food is surprising really good. Met a few friends had a fast meal. Service was with a smile. No mistakes. Drink was cold made to order. TVs everywhere. Clean -  table - floor and bathroom. A turtle really - yup they have that as well. Crisp bacon.  Yum."}
{"text":"Haven't been there for a while last time food and service were pretty good this time not so much. Went on steak night strip steak was cooked properly but very tough. They ran out of baked potatoes so had to get mashed it was (730pm). They were okay except for gravy. Service was very slow. I hope the  Fairview Tavern which I under stand is the same owner has not declined so much."}
{"text":"I found this place on one Saturday evening when I biked around the town. Based on 3-star rating on Yelp, especially about their service, I was initially hesitated to stop here for my dinner. From the outside, this place looks like a dive bar, nothing very attractive. In fact, it looks a bit disturbing to me. But, I was so hungry and I thought the worst case I would just only get one drink if the service was an issue as many people complained on Yelp and go somewhere else. I decided to sit at the bar. The bartender came to greet me immediately and asked me whether I looked for just a drink or food as well. She said that every Saturday they have special which is steak with salad and another one side dish (e.g. green bean, baked potato, fries, onion ring, sweet potatoes fries) for $10. $10 for that kind of food sounds unreal to me, so I decided to give it a shot. It was surprisingly great! The salad was fresh with good portion and the steak was huge. on top of that, my bartender was very attentive and friendly too. I left this place on that evening with very impressive feeling about the place. I, however, was quite confused about what people complained on their service since the service I had on that evening was great.  I decided to go back to this place again a week later.. and for sure it was Saturday evening since I wanted to get the $10 steak meal again :). The place was packed and I couldn't find the available seat to sit at the bar. So, I had no option beside sitting at the table. I waited about 10 minutes until one waitress came to greet me and asked for drink. The waitress was actually a bartender too (but not the one I met on my last visit). Everything was soooooo slow. I decided to move to the bar immediately when the bar seats were available. Once I sat at the bar, the same bartender I met on my last visit - her name is Amanda - came to greet me and get my order immediately. I started to understand more about those complaints from people about the slow service here. I guessed that they probably sat at the table, not the bar area, which I just experienced the same thing. I ordered the steak meal and again it was great as I got last time.   After the second visit, I always come to this place on Saturday evening for their special meal, either the $10 steak meal or $14 salmon. Both dished are phenomenal., not kidding! Both Steak and Salmon are huge. I don't think I can find any of this deal, quality, and taste at any restaurant/bar around this area.    Overall, I think this place is a little gem that you should try. They, however, have the under staffing issue for sure. Their bartenders actually work as a waitress and food runner as well.  With many redundant tasks, I think that causes the slow and inattentive service and the frustration for those people sitting at the tables. Beside the under-staffing issue, based on my own repeated experience, I found that not all staffs here are friendly. I have been visiting this place for almost 10 times now and came to the conclusion that only three bartenders that I would like to get a service from. One is Amanda. She seems to be the youngest one among all of them and great looking with long hair. Another one is one with the eye glasses on. I didn't asked her name.  I think she is the only one with the glasses though. And, the last one I didn't ask her name either. I'll ask their names on my next visit if I see them and will update this info again.  Some tips: - Please \"do not expect any fanciness from here\". It is just a small bar.  - Try to sit at the bar if you want a fast service. - Try to go there on Saturday evening for steak or salmon specials  - Look for those bartenders I mentioned.  P.S. In my thought right now, I think shouldn't tell you guys these tips since I have to fight harder for the seat at the bar on Saturday evening :) JK  .....Good luck everyone"}
{"text":"Place is a shot and a beer, the chairs are some of the worst around. Someone needs to give the manager a screw driver and tighten them up. Every single one is loose and wobly."}
{"text":"I do not know much about this place but I do know that their $10. Strip steak dinner with salad and a baked potatoe cannot be beat. The salad was good and better yet the steak and potatoe were cooked perfectly. The reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is that management did not have enough staff. The servers were so busy they hardly had time to just put your meal down and jump to the next table. But for a great steak with a price less than the grocery store you need to try it."}
{"text":"Stopped in to see Furious George play. Had never been here before. It's your typical neighborhood bar. We had great service despite the crowd and had some great mac and cheese (we added hot sauce and tomatoes). Only complaint is that the mac and cheese was a bit rich bit still very flavorful! Oh and get rid of that damn dusty fake fern in the woman's bathroom!!! :)"}
{"text":"Five star for a neighborhood type restaurant and bar. Atmosphere is bare bones bar. The music was about five notches too loud but good tunes. Drinks are dirt cheap. Service was spotty but very friendly server, to be expected for a busy Saturday night. We ordered the mussels which were cooked in wine with garlic and tomatoes, very yummy. Husband got the steak special and said it was very good. You get a strip steak, baked potato and salad for ten bucks!  And the salad is medium size with lettuce, carrots, cucumber, tomato, red onion and cheese, no skimping there. He ate every bite. I had the Mediterranean chicken pita. The chicken was juicy and tasted like it just came of of the grill outside. There was so much chicken I ate half of it before I could eat the sandwich. It had lettuce, tomato and feta Cheese. The only change I would make is to get the sauce on the side because there was too much.  I will return for sure the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Okay.  So we went again because my son's friend is working there.  He convinced us things were better.  Nope.  Worse.  Just skip this place.  Waitress in training: fine.  Bitch training her: no.  Bad service, worse food."}
{"text":"Just another bar... but good food and great specials... And a super friendly eniorment.... and there is a blue turtle there ...."}
{"text":"Let me first say that the food was good. The problem with that place is the service sucks. The table was sticky when we sat down. So much so that we thought the menus were purposefully glued to the table because they were stuck to the table. When the waitress FINALLY came to our table (after having to get our first drink from the bar) she could've cared less when we observed about the table. Her personality was awful. That place could be great if they hired front of the house staff that cared. Not sure I'll go back which is too bad for the bar because I live right down the road."}
