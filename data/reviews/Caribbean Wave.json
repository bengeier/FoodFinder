{"text":"I stopped in here confused and freezing after a bad hair appointment. I'd called ahead to order takeout which was ready for me. I ended up staying to eat and warm myself. Not only was the food delicious, the staff were kind and patient with me. Lovely people, yummy food, generous portions and great prices. It is well worth my almost 2 hour transit ride to return here."}
{"text":"2 stars for customer service. Good food, guyanese style. Prices are decent too. But the lack of a smile or greeting the customer makes me not want to return. It's like they are bothered by you. Particularly with the youngest one there."}
{"text":"Okay, just an update. On my last visit this Caribbean wave was not as friendly as I remembered it..... I went later at night and ordered some take out. The food took 45 minutes to come out (I only ordered the jerk chicken and roti) and the atmosphere was more bar oriented. There was a conflict and almost a fist fight right in front of us. All me and my boyfriend wanted to do was grab our food and get out of there. I would go back to Caribbean Wave but only during the day because the night time crowd really detracts from the experience."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and got the jerk chicken wave chow mein, and boyyyy was it super salty. Service was ok."}
{"text":"This is my penultimate stop for Caribbean food in Toronto. My university was close to this restaurant and I have frequented this place for years. Albeit I go for one dish repeatedly and this is the jerk chicken fried rice. Anyone who appreciates Caribbean food must try this place. They have a mix of Chinese and Caribbean food and it is exquisite. The prices are much lower than expected for the quality of food and the portions are massive. Their noodles are also great and the roti stands up to the best in the city. The venue is clean,  brightly lit and well serviced. The owner works there regularly and ensures things run smoothly.  There is also a bar next door that runs at night time but I have never been there. Note that their hot-sauce is quite \"hot\" so add with care. They carry a nice selection of Caribbean drinks and a good selection of bottled beer as well."}
{"text":"best caribbean food in the east end. roti with beef curry is my fav the wings are better than the wing shops around their jerk chicken and fried rice is a hit. nice and clean restaurant ."}
{"text":"First came here with my family to try the food and haven't stopped coming back. Great and friendly staff. Serving sizes are family sized and food is very tasty. Big fan of the fried rice!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Pre-ordered & went to pick up 30 minutes later to be told that my order was not processed! WTF?!   Also they have audacity to place a sign asking that you do Not use your mobile phone while ordering yet I had to wait over 15 minutes for 1 client to place her order & chat with the waitress...   The pepper shrimp was delicious."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I ever experienced since I moved to canada. The short asian lady clearly needs to learn how to interact with customers. I arrived around 10:15 pm when the lady informed me that the \"west Indian\" side of the restaurant was closed. Not sure how I was suppose to decipher that there was a West Indian side and a Chinese side from the name of the restaurant. It seemed she was already annoyed at the gods before I arrive because her attitude was atrocious! I sat by the bar and watched as she continued to serve other patrons for 15mins before me and my partner decided to leave. A  male employee seemed willing at one point to assist me but was definitely too busy to take my order. Honestly if Ritz didn't close at 10pm I wouldn't have even known that this place existed. My first and last time going to that restaurant and I will surely share my experience on other social media platforms.  Brief recap. 1. Poor customer service. 2. Unwelcoming atmosphere  3. Lack of staff  4. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"We had the spicy shrimp, mixed fried rice and wave jerk chowmein. Everything tasted SO good. We would definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"I got the jerk chicken chow mein. It was fresh and tasty but everything was way too salty! Still drinking water right now"}
{"text":"We found this place randomly but have been coming back ever since! The oxtail stew and curry chicken is delicious! Best I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This used to be my Jerk chicken go to spot in scarborough about 5-6 years ago. The quality has gone down significantly. Just ordered today; My jerk chicken was too salty with lack of spices. And the girl who took my order was short as if i owed her somethhing when i tried to clarify my order. $9.50 for jerk chicken & rice & peas?... There are better places in the city."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, if a sign isn't appealing to the eye, I usually don't bother with the place.  So yes, I do judge books by their cover.  Admittedly, I once got a pretty looking book and the novel turned out to be craptacular.    My cousin ordered take-out from here and normally I don't trust her food choices but she (kind of) redeemed herself with this place. This is definitely the best place she's ever picked and I've already gone back for more without her.    One of the best items on their menu would be their Jerk Chicken chow mien which is packed with flavour.  Their fried rice is also very good and a must try.  Though their oxtail is not as good as what they have at The Real Jerk, it is still very good.  I'd definitely go here again if I had a craving for oxtail and don't want to take the trek out west."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Caribbean Wave a bunch of times an the food has always been good. But today the food was just gross. The Caribbean Wave rice we ordered was stale an cold. We had to send it back. The veggies we ordered tasted disgusting and was swimming in a pool of corn starch liquid. We drove all the way to Scarborough to eat at this restaurant today an needless to say it was a great waste of time."}
{"text":"Greatsized portions for the money. Always tastes great, never lacks flavor. Service is friendly,environment is clean. Shrimp fried rice is so delicious. Recommended."}
{"text":"This is my third time being here. For whatever reason the food is dropping grade each time. The jerk chicken with rice and peas has become the staple here. Unfortunately they were out of rice and peas today so had to settle for the the wave fried rice with jerk chicken. The jerk flavor was nonexistent this time and over saturated with soy sauce. Also ordered the chilli chicken which was a suprised hit. The service was great as always. The food was average to say the least.  Overall rating of 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Clean! Lots of Space. Not the usual crammed up caribbean restaurant. Clean tables and chairs. Family oriented place. Great for the couples too.  Wonderful dishes!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome friendly service and food! First time there based on past yelp reviews, and it did not disappoint.  They serve a slightly different jerk chicken than what I had envisioned, but it was tasty and I am glad we ordered too much so I can enjoy it for another two days!  Thank you and we will be back when we are back in the area!"}
{"text":"I can only rate based on two dishes, but each was fantastic. I had oxtail with peas and rice, and it was delicious. The oxtail meat was practically falling off the bond, and it was well seasoned with lots of gravy. The flavor was good, mildly sweet, somewhat smokey and really savory with lots of Caribbean seasonings, as is typical of Trinidad style stew. The portion was a lot larger than expected, with rice and peas enough for two. The chickpea roti that my husband had was also really tasty, and the portion size was huge. The dhalpuri was soft and stuffed with ground, seasoned split pad between the layers, and the inside was packed with chickpeas and potatoes. The filling was not the type that is swimming in gravy. It was very thick, which made it easy to pick up and eat like a sandwich. Oh, and the hot pepper sauce that was served alongside the meal was so tasty. Really spicy and full of tangy, peppery flavor. Not the thick kind you plop on the side, but the you're that you can sort of sprinkle drops of over your food.  The lady who was on cash and waitressing seemed to be the owner, though I'm not sure. She was really nice, bringing us an extra plate in case we wanted to share, despite us not asking. It was a good idea, because my husband couldn't help but try my oxtail once he smelled it. There is a good selection of drinks from a self serve fridge, and there seems to be a bar as well.   It's not a fancy place, don't go expecting any creative food presentation or tablecloths, but if you want some delicious, authentic homestyle Trinidadian food in a friendly, laid-back atmosphere, this is the place."}
{"text":"My favourite local spot for Guyanese style fried rice.  Only place I can get better fried rice is my grandmother's home cooking, lol!  Service is friendly, prices decent and food always great. My favourites are fried rice, pepper shrimp, and jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I think they should add a dance floor too!  The food is so good The pepper sauce is amazing People are friendly Service is a bit slow But worth it!!  I haven't been there for a while but would love to go again!"}
{"text":"I visit Caribean Wave at least once a month. In the few years that I have been going to Caribeean Wave they have won a couple awards-to which I am not surprised in the least.  The food is very appetizing, albeit I only order a handful of items off the menu so I can't say everything is good (not a big fan of their chlli chicken). However, their jerk chicken and fried chicken are amazing. You can order this on top of fried rice or have it separately. Also, the pepper shrimp is probably the best thing there. Recently, my group of friends and I hosted our annual Christmas Party and we decided to order from Caribbean Wave since it was close by. Most of my friends had never tried Caribbean Wave but were interested in trying it. We made a large order on Boxing Day and expected it to take at least 1 hour - however, they were able to make it within 30 mins. That night the owner was there and was extremely gracious as she provided additional sauces, plates, forks for free of charge. Once we came home we were surprised at the quantity of food. Everyone was greatly satisfied with the food. If you are a fan of spicy food I would definitely try Caribbean Wave. Good price for generous portions of food."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I'm craving some authentic Caribbean  food. I have tried the oxtail with the rice and peas and it was delicious!  I have recently tried the jerk chicken with the rice and peas and it's definitely not like the ones I have had before.   The price is decent considering the portion size and taste."}
{"text":"This place was visited from Yelp. It's a small restaurant in Scarborough.  The place could use some fixing up and cosmetic work but the food was absolutely the best take out Caribbean food!!! I had curry chicken and my hubby had chicken roti. They were both delicious and the chicken was marinated and cooked perfectly.  The next visit we had jerk chicken and peas and rice and husband opted to have the roti again!   Well the jerk was great and spicy but so flavourful. It did not burn your tongue off while eating as some restaurants do and call it jerk! The meat was also marinated beautifully and melted in our mouth.  I left off one star because of the restaurant aesthetics."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our recent trip to Toronto, and this was one of the meals I fondly remember and wish I could get again. After staying in downtown Toronto for a few days, we stopped at Caribbean Wave on our way from the zoo to Niagara Falls. Boy am I glad this place is visible from the highway because it is a real treasure and really made my day. I got chick peas and potatoes which were spiced really fantastically. But I was super envious of my husband's (ridiculously large) choices. First, he got jerk chicken lo mein, which was amazing. Combining Carribean flavors with Chinese food is brilliant and so well executed here. The even better standout for me was the roti. How can bread be the best thing I ate? I don't know, but it was. It was flaky, doughy, amazing, and enough to feed a small family. I really regretted not getting my chick peas in the roti after I tried it, but my husband reluctantly let me keep eating from his because there was no way he'd finish it anyway. If I had to say something critical about our experience, the service was a bit slow. But the woman who took our order must have apologized 10 times for the slow service. Not necessary. When the food is this good, it can be a little slow to come out. So now the challenge is for us to book another Toronto trip and find an excuse to get to Carribean Wave to overdose on roti, jerk chicken, and other fantastic food. We will definitely be back and I will definitely not forget that the roti is a must order menu item."}
{"text":"They copy your driver license information. The service is nice but the quality of the food is questionable. The server is friendly. I order the curry chicken and rice , it was lukewarm when it arrives and not much flavor, very bland. My friend order the fried rice with chicken and it also serve lukewarm. Is the food cook fresh or just been sitting there?? One more negative point is that when we pay with credit card , they check our driver license and copy all the information on it for security reason. Some BS! There is no reason you need the customer address for credit card. You have been warn!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is terrible. I've been here before and have had the same re-occuring issues. I called to make an order for a party I was going to and the lady kept cutting me off mid sentence then got short with me because she couldn't understand what I wanted."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times over the past few years. It's a solid choice to get your grub one.  This time for the table we ordered the fried fish (yum!), mixed fried rice with chicken in top; noodles with veggies and chicken on top and jerk chicken.  The jerk chicken wasn't good and it looked too liquid-y.  The rice and the noodles dishes were too salty for me, which is sad because the chicken was nice and moist and tender.    It's a big place that can hold a group of people and they do takeout.  The service is really nice - they even offered to warm up some dishes as they had been on the table for awhile."}
{"text":"The only WAVE we experienced was our stomach's turning all the way home after we left.. If you want this food, order ahead for pick up, it's slow and interior is ugly. The jerk chicken was POOR, bad rice/peas, terrible gravy. Curry chicken decent. Average prices, both felt 'off' afterwards (unhealthy)."}
{"text":"Great meal. Great portions. Great prices. So yummy. Hit the spot for flavour. Real \"wok\" taste on the fried rice. Ox tail, jerk chicken and fried rice were good. Clean restaurant. Good service. I would most definitely return."}
{"text":"The overall taste was good for a fast food restaurant. The portion was big.  The jerk chicken on their fried rice taste good. The rice is a bit too salty for my taste.  But I still loved the combo. But definitely has an Asian twist to it.   Lam curry with rice was so so.  The pepper shrimp taste good."}
{"text":"This is really good best to order is jerk chicken with fried rice and oxtail curry.  It tastes so good"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday, around 10:30pm. While going thru the menu, the server informed that very few items were available at this hour!! The choice was quite limited. We ordered Jerk Wave Chow Mein and Jerk Chicken Fried Rice. The quality was average, nothing special to highlight and also not much to be disappointed.... just simple average."}
{"text":"Got a jerk chicken fried rice to go for $7.75 For the price you get big portions and a whole lot of meat. I could hardly see the rice with all jerk chicken that was piled on top.   I know jerk chicken is suppose to be a bit salty but I found everything to be heavily salted. The fried rice was dark brown with all the soy sauce they put on it and the jerk meat was so salty that it had a burning sensation. Even so the meal was pretty decent and very filling.  Like most reviewers have stated already the staff there are very friendly and service was quite fast. I got my order within 5 minutes and there were many people that ordered take out and about 6 tables being served. at the same time. There are also many seats for dine in aswell."}
{"text":"I looooove the chicken wings, I think they are the best in the city."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken and got home to find what looked like chicken scraps with hardly any edible meat on them. Everything was dry and crispy like it was scavenged from the garbage."}
{"text":"Huge portions, friendly service, clean and warm environment. Prices are very affordable for the amount of food you get. Jerk chicken is really spicy, but waitress provides a pitcher of ice water to prepare. Chicken curry is flavourful and boneless (which is rare to find). Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I have been a chef for 16 years now and i find i am very picky when it comes to finding a place to eat. With that being said i got the oxtail with rice and peas aswell as the curry goat with rice and peas and the fried chicken wings and i was not disappointed. I LOVE Caribbean food and this is by far the best i have ever had. The oxtail was melt in your mouth tender. The curry was full of flavor and the wings were perfect. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants amazing food at a great price."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Friendly service, decent food, clean and cozy. Large portions, good to share. We ordered Guyanese style fried rice and chow mein shared between three."}
{"text":"Great Caribbean restaurant in the markham/scarborough area. They have everything from chow mein to  jerk chicken to poulari to dhaal and even curry!  This visit we had the wave wings (spicy), shrimp curry, black bean beef...unfortunately they were out of poulari :(  The good: - generous portions - delicious in house made hot sauce - food is seasoned perfectly - friendly wait staff who are happy to recommend dishes - veggies in the black bean beef were perfectly cooked - generous with shrimp in the curry and beef in the black bean beef dish  The cons: - wait was a bit long for food  Urge you to visit and likely will serve as lunch and leftovers for next days lunch or  midn8ght snack :)"}
{"text":"inconsistent, food taste good some times, other times stale or spoiled tasting. Bought food on Thursday decent and fresh, bought food on sunday thought I ordered from a different restaurant just terrible, not sure if they have different cooks for during the week and the weekends. Ive tasted better and would rather go to hakka lengend or tangerine."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews, my cousin and i decided to check this place out. I had studied abroad on a Caribbean island for 2 years, so i've come to love their food. Anyways, we were seated promptly walking in ( mind you that it was a weekday for lunch we popped in, looking for a quick bite). We were greeted by smiles from the front counter and everyone seemed so welcoming-so 5 stars for the great atmosphere.   We came to the conclusion of ordering  jerk chicken with chow mein noodles( since it was so highly raved about) . To our surprise it was the perfect amount to be shared among 2 people, and we wern't feeling all that piggish to begin with, so good choice on our part. waitress was super nice. the food was great, other than the fact that it was a bit too salty for my liking, i still finished my portion no doubt. Maybe it was just an off day, which i get. Very affordable food..worth checking out and  definetly going to return to try some of their other dishes and reminisce of that beautiful island!"}
{"text":"I love here, my family and I eat it all the time. Would highly recommend it to anyone. The jerk chicken with fried rice is amazing; the fried rice alone is so good. But my family's favourite is the chicken wings (regular + honey garlic) and special chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Tasty food. No complaints here. I would return again.  I ordered the chow mein with a baked chicken on top, the potato balls, sweet and sour chicken and wave chicken wings.  The wave chicken wings are basically Wings tossed with pepper flakes."}
{"text":"Overall a great fan of this place! the food is great and for the price the portion size is huge! 1 dish can feed 2 people more than comfortably.. Overall I would give this pleace five stars but lacks one solely based on atmosphere... Everytime I have been there the place has been almost empty and the people that are there tend to be older men who wont stop hitting on you which can be quite annoying especially when you just want a quick bite in peace. Other than that; in terms of the food its great! but for the ladies... i'd suggest take out!"}
{"text":"Great Service - Great Food - Great Food to Price Ratio  Upon arriving at the restaurant we were promptly greeted and seated.  The waitress approached us and explained the menu and gave us suggestions.  The food was great. The serving sizes are family size - one order can feed two.  We ordered a lot of food and ended up having to take some home.  The amount of food they give you to what they charge is FANTASTIC.  We ordered:  -  Curry Beef -  Whole Friend Chicken -  Fried Rice -  Chowmein -  2 sodas  With tip we paid $63.00 and served four people.  Incredible.  The food tasted great also.  The curry was a little spicy for me but that is everyone's personal preference."}
{"text":"I don't make my way over to Morningside too often, but that's exactly where I found this restaurant. Through the power of Yelp I sorted by rating and went to one of the highest ones. This place is definitely a hidden gem. Almost all of its neighbours have gone out of business and the restaurant itself doesn't look anything special inside or out. However, the food tasted much better than its plain appearance. Not too spicy, but still lots of flavour in both the noodles and the chicken. Guess the old cliché about judging book covers still holds true"}
{"text":"We were hungry and didn't want to spend too much on takeout. I got the ox curry on rice and a friend got the jerk chicken on rice. The portions were large, had a nice kick of spice and well worth the $10. They don't make it too hot but their hot sauce lit our tongues on fire. Definitely have milk on hand if you get it. The mango sauce was a nice addition to the spring rolls as an appetizer. This place is nothing fancy but good homestyle Caribbean food."}
{"text":"Food is not bad but the service is terrible, I think the owner's daughter works there, she really rude."}
{"text":"Excellent foot, great portions. I definitely recommend the jerk chicken. It has tasty flavours, and the meat itself is very tender.  I will have to say that the curry goat was lukewarm when we received it. After asking for it to be nuked in the oven, it tasted much better. However, I still recommend the jerk chicken.  The staff is friendly and relatively attentive. I would most definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Be sure to try: chilli chicken, pholourie.  Chilli chicken here has a different outer coating versus hakka chilli chicken. It is also finished with a tamarind based sauce which is sweet and tangy. Hot sauce given on the side is a must. Removing a star because quality has been variable over the past few orders. Order in advance for take-out.  Pholourie here are more dense than what I'm used to but are a good value."}
{"text":"If I want some salty greasy Chinese jamaican food with really spicy hot sauce, this is where I come. I recommend wave wings and fried shark *drools*"}
