{"text":"When you enter the mall go to the food court area, once you enter it is the last unit. 

One of the few Chinese takeout places that give you great tasting food in copious amounts for $6.50 after tax. 

note-(one box can usually be shared between two people but I am a glutton & one box is devoted to me)

Their top items are:

Singapore noodles- (spicy thin rice noodles with curry, shrimp pork and leeks) \"Super tasty & gives you a nice feeling of full without dragging out hours after the act has been done.\"

Black bean beef noodles- (thin sliced beef and black beans with sliced onions slathered in a savory brown sauce on top of rice noodles) \"Full of flavors, but is a bit oily. I get this sometimes when I know all I am going to do after is vege in front of a t.v.\"

Sweet and sour chicken or pork on fried rice. \"My favorite is the chicken version as it is not as heavy as the pork...yet still fills me to satisfaction\"

Fried chicken on rice. \"On days when I do not feel like consuming tons of sweet  or savory sauce, just the bare goods.\"

This is strictly a take out place but there are several tables if you choose to eat on the spot, as far as take out Chinese this is the best for taste quantity and price."}
{"text":"Let me get one thing straight - this is NOT quality food - but it is damn good CHEAP QUANTITY drunken night meal type of food. 

Best place to order fried squid tentacles - it'll be so full the box barely closes.  

Their party trays are phenomenal value for your buck - it'll be covered in aluminum so heaping it creates a mound which for that alone, gives this place a 4.

If you can walk in to a dingy messy place with sticky walls and crazy steam and still say I'd like to place an order for something fried please, then this is for you! If you're a bit more particular about first world things like sanitation, ambience and customer service, this is not the hole-in-the-wall cheap chinese food you are looking for."}
{"text":"Hidden gem inside Scarborough mall! 
This place is sooo damn cheap! 
My partner and I got a fried chicken and fried rice meal for only $9. This thing feeds 4 people!!! 
The chicken is surprisingly juicy!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Chinese takeouts in Scarborough. Wouldn't recommend to dine in but the food makes up for it if you decide to eat here. I ordered chicken fried rice to go and they pack the container so much you can't even close it + it's cheap!"}
