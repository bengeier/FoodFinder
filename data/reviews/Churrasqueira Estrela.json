{"text":"The chicken isn't anything special compared to other portuguese chicken restaraunts in the area."}
{"text":"For taste and quality of portugese chicken this is the place to go.  They also have authentic dishes on their hot table at all times. But what keeps me coming back is the charcoal setup they have. And that's rare to find in a restaurant.  

Edit:
Dropped it from 5 star to 4 star since i think quality has slipped lately."}
{"text":"Excellent Portuguese Chicken. Fresh off the charcoal rotisserie!!!  I haven't tried anything else on the menu, the Chicken is Superb!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best BBQ chicken in Toronto.  We get take out from Estrela at least once a week.  The BBQ chicken is outstanding.

Everything I've tried from here is great.  They also cater. We use them for birthdays, Father's Day, Mother's Day, all special events.

You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"One of the very few authentic Portuguese chicken spots in the city. Rotisseried on a real charcoal fire pit (unlike other places that use a regular BBQ grill). They have been extremely consistent with all their food from the chicken to the potatoes to the other tradition dishes. This place is the real deal, friendly staff as well. Mainly a take out spot but there are a few tables in there for some sit downs. Also with a bakery next door how could you go wrong!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for lunch yesterday. I am new to Portuguese food so was excited to try this and I'm glad I did. I couldn't decide between chicken and fish but In the end I went with chicken. Their portions are huge so get prepare your stomach to be full. I will definitely be back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Super good chicken barbecue! They have many sides available too! Although I don't know the names i just order by looking at the display and they are kind enough to tell the foods name. 
Most of the people coming are ordering take out, their food is so affordable or i should say very cheap and they have big serving sizes too when you wanna eat like a hungry man. The restaurant have decent sitting area for dine in and the staff are nice as well. If you're craving for Portuguese food then i can say this is one of the good ones in North York area."}
{"text":"Great Portuguese chicken at great prices! 

Small takeout place with a few tables for dining in, we picked up a full chicken, large rice and medium potatoes and it all cost around $24 for around 6lbs of delicious food. 

The chicken and the sauce are the star of the show, the chicken is juicy and packed with flavour and the sauce is spicy and addicting. I couldn't stop eating and picking at it even after I was stuffed. The rice and potatoes were also good, the potatoes were garlicky and soft and the rice was a great complement to the chicken. 

Service was really quick, we were in and out in about 5 minutes, the food is ready-made for fast takeout. 

If I lived nearby this would definitely be a weekly meal. I would probably make the drive just for the chicken though, the seafood also sounds delicious and I'd love to give that a try as well!"}
