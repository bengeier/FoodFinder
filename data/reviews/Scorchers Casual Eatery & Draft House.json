{"text":"Best hamburgers in town and just love their Wings.

Let's update this review.....they still have the best hamburgers on Broadway and the best big wings..love them!"}
{"text":"My buddy basically lives here so it has to be a decent place. I came to scorchers before golfing about a month ago and was pleased with the service. I had the special with mojo sauce and since I hit mojo golf balls it had a huge significance on my golf game. Bottom line- good beer, good food, and the lake on your left."}
{"text":"Great service! Friendly people. Customers are also friendly and nice. Best place to go to in Lorain. Pool tables are available most of the time. Food is good. Typical bar food with a variety of options. Prices are reasonable. Beers are cheaper for Browns, Cavs, Indians, and Ohio State games."}
{"text":"Went to this place for drinks on two occasions.  First time...the service was slow and the bartenders were unprofessional.  The second time...which was last night were ULTRA unprofessional and disrespectful.  So I spoke to the person who said she was the manager and after speaking with her for 30-40 seconds realized that this individual could not have been the one in charge.  

Both times I went at night...so I don't know what the day crowd looks like.  But either way they won't see my money anymore."}
{"text":"Not a fan of sports bars but parking easy enough, the service was excellent and our bar server

was very attentive.

   The food came out the way you hoped hot and flavorful.

  The wings had fresh garlic on them not powdered and the sauce clung to the wings.

  The fries were nice and crisp not soggy at all.

   The cob salad was a thing to be hold.

   The drinks were well made and hit you where you should be hit.

     Great open atmosphere ,good food and great drinks.

 Everything a sports bar should be.

 Bon appetit."}
{"text":"So upset. Ignored at the bar for the first 15min.  Ordered food that took OVER AN HOUR. Was not very good at all. I forgot how much I dislike coming here. Then I forget and come back."}
{"text":"Great service. Good people. Great food and good beer. Defininate must stop."}
{"text":"Always good pool table are sometimes pack but other then that always cool and chilled"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service, bar tenders aren't really interested in \"non-regular\" customers.  Ignore people who are standing right in front of them and are very rude when you call them out"}
{"text":"We have been here several times.
The joint is hardly anything to get excited about. Food is typical mediocre bar grub. Service isn't any different. Dysfunctional would be a kind term. The only thing going for them is they are the only joint open near the Palace theater. This last experience put the nail in the coffin...food order went in at 6:49 pm, we were told it might take 30 to 40 minutes due to the crowd. Ok, 60 minutes later and we notice customers that arrived after us getting their food orders. Management and staff tell us our order was more difficult. What is so difficult about heating up a cheese quesadilla? Ended up taking food to go because the concert was due to start. After returning home we opened up the \"to go\" only to find both quesadillas burned and an additional order of wings cooked until they were leather. All we can say is NEVER AGAIN!!
To all...beware...they don't care..."}
{"text":"Just looks like a local bar. I stopped for lunch on a cold winter weekday.  Only two other groups in the place, and almost empty. Had the wings special. They were very good and it's their specialty. No table service, you order at the counter. 

Atmosphere is a bit divey. It's a sports bar with air hockey, pool tables, TVs and Keno."}
{"text":"Came in to simply get a drink. They asked for my ID, but obviously they asked for ID in order for us to get into the facility. Bartenders were rude, even told other patrons at the bar that they could not serve us. Unprofessional and distasteful. I will never come back here again, extremely disappointed with their service."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place to try good beer at a cheap price. I got 2 Bud Lights and 2 Sam Adams Octoberfest drafts for under $10. They have a couple pool tables and lots of tvs to watch the games."}
{"text":"Got to admit, this is one of my favorite places.  It is a little out of the way, but worth the search.  Great food, especially for the price.  Great selection of beer on tap.  I believe it is 20oz glasses for about $3.50.  Most of the food is between 5 and 10 dollars.  TVs all around.

There is no table service for food or drinks, but don't let that get in the way."}
{"text":"TVs everywhere tons of beers. Super friendly service really great wings. I stopped in last night to play NTN trivia, the same bartender was here the next night remembered my name and what I ordered."}
{"text":"Give this place the business they deserve...

THE UP-SIDE:  Look, this is downtown Lorain.  While I love the city, it can be a little on the shady side at times.  I gotta give big props to any business that fights the good fight and stays open in downtown Lorain.  

In addition, this place does have a good selection of bar food, a ton of open space, a pool table, and friendly service.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:  Like I said, the neighborhood can be iffy.  

THE SUM-IT-UP:  It's a neighborhood bar with neighborhood bar food.  Nothing special for the highly selective and snobbish, but just perfect for folks looking to kickback and drink with friends - probably the best place for doing so in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Comfortable neighborhood sports bar. Great blend of people the way it's supposed to be. I've eaten at nearly 300 wing joints in this country. Bayou Kicker traditional wings are in my top ten.

It's a sports bar. Forget the reviews picking apart stupid crap. 5 pool tables. Plenty of TV's. 2 Sand volleyball courts. NTN trivia. 30ish handles. Great service.

My only knocks on the place are: 1. No beer menu. With thirty handles plus bottles there should be a list to read. 2. No Golden Tee! Video golf is a sports bar staple.

I was going to 4 star this place because of the beer list and golden tee issue, but I'm not whiney insecure twat like a lot of other Yelpers."}
{"text":"For the past 3 months my husband and I have invited family and friends to play volleyball at Scorchers. It was a very peaceful and good time. And the group has spent several dollars on food and drink while we played each time. 

Our latest game was scheduled for Saturday, July 8. We show up and the site manager tells us we can't have the volleyball Or use the courts because their was a \"previous\" incident on the court. 

Bullshit. My husband and I had to call ALL of our 15+ invited guests and cancel what was set to be a good evening of volleyball, food and drinks at Scorchers. Because of this, I will never ever patron Scorchers again and I will tell all my friends and family to do the same. 

Pretty sure there was no such incident and Manager had a different motive for why he didn't want us on the volleyball court."}
{"text":"Came to wing night. The wings were good but the ranch is watered down for dippin sauce. Kinda annoyed I couldn't get a drink menu. It's ok for group of friends, pool tables and outside patio is really nice."}
{"text":"First, I've never been too a scorchers. Walked in, looked around and sat at a booth. And sat. And sat. We had no idea you have to order at a counter by the bar. So after asking the bar tender we ordered. First of all if you see people sitting looking confused, say something!!! The area is pretty much a ghost town and there was only one other table of ppl. 
Second,the menu had a pic of some nice looking  nachos. I ordered em. Like $4.50 later I get a handful of bagged round chips with cheese whiz and a cup of jalape√±os. Not at all what was expected. The pretzel bites looked burned and had no flavor. The cheese quesadilla was good tho.
As far as drinks, it was nice too see Angry Orchard on draft but, I had too show the bar tender which tap had the beer I wanted and mind you, this was my first time having it and oh yeah, I don't work there SHE DOES!!
All in all I highly doubt returning which is a shame as it's close too where my daughter now lives."}
{"text":"WAY THE HELL TOO LOUD - it's a place to drink and eat - not a place to socialize with colleagues! I suppose if you are from the area and this is your spot - I can see the love for it. 

I tried the wings and coming from Buffalo - I will tell you - these wings are really GOOD!

The place isn't the cleanest, but you have to think - BAR!"}
{"text":"Scorchers USED to have the best bar food around, but lately they have gotten pretty bad. I recently went in to order my favorites, I got an order of wings and my favorite mushrooms. When I got my wings, they didn't give me my blue cheese dressing; didn't even offer it. When I asked for another dipping sauce for my shrooms, he charged me an extra .50. Really? The wings were horrible and dried out and the place looked like a dump. Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. STAY AWAY. go to b-dubs if u want GOOD WINGS."}
{"text":"The bar area is big and pretty nice, drinks were cold, bar food was average, but not bad at all. Lots of options. Our server seemed alright until another patron requested another drink because his drink didn't taste right. He requested a new shot from a new bottle, which she eventually obliged, but not without an attitude and commenting about the situation while taking our food order. The bartender apologized to us as if she was apologizing for the other customer and it honestly came off pretty racist. I can't imagine receiving the same treatment if I had requested a new drink. The situation kind of pissed me off, so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Scorcher's is about as good as it gets in downtown Lorain. It's like God came down from the clouds and dropped a decent, clean well thought out bar in the middle of the hood. 

They have a very large food menu and as far as bar food goes it's better than average. Want to go home and eat your bar food? Call ahead and pick up your order or just stop in an they will pack it up for you in less than 10 minutes. 

The bartenders are always very friendly and the owner is typically there at all times. The bar has a decent beer and liquor selection.

I love the way this place is set up. It's large and the booths and tables are very spread out. They have quite a few televisions if you want to take in a game with friends. Want to play some games? They have two pool tables and a couple dart boards. They also have a great music selection on their juke box.

A great place to hang out with friends or that special someone if you are looking for a relaxed, laid back kind of bar. Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"I must have Dortmunder Gold.  I must.  I flew home with a six pack in my luggage last month.  Yeah, it's that bad.  We have great beer in Texas, but sometimes only a Dortmunder will do.  

Scorchers has Dortmunder on tap (and other Great Lakes beers, plus the usuals).  This is a great bar to come to if you actually want to 1) sit and 2) have a conversation with the people you came with.  They have many tv's for sports, trivia, this crazy boxing arcade game with a speed bag hanging from it, and last time I was in there they were playing Iron and Wine (nice and wholly unexpected).  

The food is bar food, but decent bar food.  As you may have noticed, I'm a fan of fried cheese and here they have mozzarella wedges instead of sticks.  I love getting my starch in cheese in new forms.  

I've noticed that there are definite waves here.  I went during an NFL game in December and the bar was full of 30 - 40 somethings yelling at TVs.  The SECOND the game was over the place was EMPTY, and a few minutes later is was full of early 20 somethings.  

Generally, it's a laid back sports bar, that caters to a diverse all-ages crowd.  It's just down the street from Ghoulardi's (or whatever it's called these days) and at first I would retreat here when the bands at G's would get especially enthusiastic, now I tend to skip G's and go straight to Scorchers."}
{"text":"Great place! Me & my husband sat at the bar ordered a round of drinks. Bartender was friendly & gave good recommendations. She made the Long Island perfect. We ordered dinner as well. Great food. They also had a pool table area. Will return for fun & more drinks soon."}
{"text":"Not many places to get decent wings in this town. Scorcher's fills that void. Great draft beer collection but i had a bad glass of Dortmunder Gold. maybe the keg sat too long?
  All in all if you want wings and beer, scorchers is the place to go. decent atmosphere, no drunks."}
{"text":"Friendly, cheap and fun. What more can you want from a neighborhood bar?"}
