{"text":"Was not impressed. I ordered chicken strips for my daughter.  The coleslaw was on the verge of going bad.  The chicken was burned.  The fries were cold and floppy.  The lemonade tasted like dirt. The place was filthy and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude.  If I could give it zero stars,  I would."}
{"text":"Ordered the family pack which included 25 wings, fries and garlic bread.  When I checked my order the fries were cold.  I asked the lady can I please have some fresh french fries.  She immediately got an attitude and told me they was not cold.  She did take them back with an attitude and gave me some fresh ones with salt and I said no salt.  I didn't want to address the issue again, so I took them. The fries were salty and the wings tasted as if they were sitting there and hot sauce was applied to them. Not to mention the garlic bread didn't even have any garlic butter whatever just toasted. The wings were very small. Very disappointment, customer service very poor and food was not good. Will never visit this location again!"}
{"text":"Occasionally the wings from this place may taste a bit dull or strange but most of the time we return because honestly when they are prepared with patience by the employees they are really good!!! Which is most of the time thankfully!! However ALWAYS check your order!!! They have a habit of forgeting a order. The place isn't the nicest inside but its good food that always brings us back (:"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Baseline and was always a customer of the Original Long Wongs on McDowell and 28th street....but I have to say the wings here are better.  These wings had a lot of meat on em, service was friendly and the place is a bit of a dive..but the food is great!!"}
{"text":"For starters, any business restaurant or not that makes me pay their credit/debit business fees, automatically gets one star. Secondly, theyre not boneless wings, theyre chicken tenders dipped in sauce... an entire bucket of sauce. I couldve opened my own rib joint with the amount of honey bbq they gave me. Finally, i am now dealing with the aftermath in the bathroom as we speak."}
{"text":"It's nitty, it's gritty, the food is AWESOME and the clientile & staff is straight hood! It's in the middle of the REAL south side of Phoenix right off of Central & Baseline. It's crazy awesome. At first glance ifs pretty colorful and kind of cool, if it were wiped down with rags dampened with clorox! LOL! 

This is TOTALLY my kind of place!! Its straight hood! It's in a strip mall and is between a Chinese food place and a day labor place. It's kind of crazy there. If you're dining after dark I FULLY recommend ordering things to go because there's been shootings there before. Two that I know of, but YO she shouldn't have looked at her like that! GAH! JK! 

There are a few retro video games there and a couple of pool tables and there's also a bar in the back! (yay!!) but the bar scene isn't that great. But the booze is cheap! (double yay!)

Like all Long Wongs, this place is known for their hot wings which are made fast, cheap & delicious! their suicide wings are the owner's pride and joy and trust me... they're HOTT!! I once downed an entire pitcher of Margaritas while scarfing on a dozen trying to win a bet. And at the end of the night, I prevailed while holding my head up HIGH before I crashed down to the floor cuz I was trashed! 

They have the usual greasy spoon food and it's all at fair prices. They also have bbq and solid dinners. Like speghetti or steak dinners. I'm a huge fan of their fried zucchini. 

This place is very rough around the edges but it's still the small neighboor place that it was intended to be. Where those in know which side of the menu to order from. Where drunks get trashed in the back room bar. Where hustlers get gullable rez girls (like me) to bet them $20 a ball at some 8ball. where sometimes fights break out - but it's not a terrible thing. I don't know how to explain it... Its home. It's rough, it's the hood but the people are real. There is NO pretention in this place. It's straight up good food at straight up good prices. You can have a great time here - I have had many... just keep an eye on your purse."}
{"text":"The wings here are not all that great anymore like they used to be . you get wings and nothing but bone. i bought some lastnight and each wing finished in one bite drenched in sauce i guess thats the only thing good about them . but i was so dissapointed. you guys can do better cmon"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I went to Long Wongs because the name was funny and the place seemed kind of shady and I was feeling adventurous. I don't remember Chinese food being on the menu, however wings, ribs, burgers, etc. are. I got the wings and they didn't disappoint. Not to spicy and plenty of flavor. I can't wait to go back and try their other offerings."}
{"text":"I been going here as long as I can remember. I love the honey hot. I get them every time I come in. I love the fact they have wing specials everyday (wings, fries and a drink combo). Perfect prices and very good customer service. The girls are very fast and accurate when putting orders in. Wings are made fast, hot and ready to the order. DÃ©cor not that great and location not the best either; but hey great wing stop if you are craving wings :)"}
{"text":"I tried to place an order for 100 wings and they told me I couldn't place it because they had too many orders already.. baffled. Horrible customer service and it was just a phone order."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! Everytime we go our experience has been great!! We get the honey hot wings extra crispy and the kiddies love the jalapeno popper burger! The fries, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, mushrooms & zucchini are all pretty tasty. The place looks ghetto and don't be surprised to get hit up for spare change outside. The booths & chairs are ratchet so we've always took our food to go. What they lack in looks and charm they make up for in taste as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Love Marcia's long Wong's! They have some of the best wings, I always get the 25 wing family meal with extra fries instead of garlic bread. The medium is just right not to hot and not to mild! The pricing isn't bad either and when you you place an order over the phone it's usually only like a 10-15 min wait for your food. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"WOOHOO!  Wings that are meaty enough to be worth the price and spicy enough to satisfy!

Driving up, the address and strip mall are screaming \"Don't get out of your vehicle here\" GHETTO...but since I am a white boy trained in brazilian jui jitsu, I am not worried.  I got out of the truck, acknowledged the skaters and gang bangers and proceeded to the door of the restaurant.  

On walking in, the menu items and prices are written on the wall in magic marker.  Some have been changed, some have been removed, and some have been made into weekly specials.  This night, a dozen wings is going for $6.50 before tax.  I place my order and proceed to wander around the empty dining room.  It is clean and spartan...a jukebox that advertises free play...several 1980's vintage video games...no restroom  available...

When I ordered suicidal wings, the lady behind the counter asked if I was sure about suicidal...that I might want to try hot first.  Being a reckless and brave person, I reconfirmed suicidal.  She told me that the order would take a few minutes, and asked if I minded seeds in the wing sauce.  I let her know that if seeds were required for hot wings, I would be OK with them.

The wings are hot, fresh and generous...I have been gratified to have to put 3 bites into cleaning the meat and skin off the wings.  They are hot in seasoning and temperature...I could only get through half an order before having to switch to tortillas, carrots and ranch dressing to cool the fire.  

Forehead sweating...tears in my eyes...Marcia's Long Wongs got it right.

Give 'em a try...even tho the restaurant screams GHETTO."}
{"text":"Food is great but employees are beyond subpar..! 
They hang out in the back and avoid helping people and when you ask to order something that isn't already made they literally yell from the back that they don't want to make it. They chat while you place your order so it's a wonder how they get it right. Only reason there is more than one star is because the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Seriously what happened to this place. They use to care about the business. Dirty dining room. Homeless and drunks out front arguing and panhandling. Not sure who's running this place but you need better management."}
{"text":"Wanted some wings yesterday so I stopped in with my girl, we got 18 wings.. Honey hot (bomb) medium (perfectly spicy but not too much) and bbq (good balance of sweet but not too much vinegar) and some fried pickles. Took about 15 minutes to get our wings so next time I'd call in the order on the way but overall very tasty. Got the right amount of wings none were missing. Also note they don't have Chinese food as is listed under their food bio, probably was miss entered as there's a Chinese spot right next door and the signs kinda run together. Highly suggested if you need wings on the south side!"}
{"text":"I love the hot wings here more than hemorrhoids love buttholes! I've been to other long wong's as well, and these are hands down the best. Friendly service, delicious entrees = heaven! Worth the drive fo' sho'"}
{"text":"Rating the service as it is below sub-par and unfortunately has been for sooo many years. I wish there was something closer in South Phoenix to rival them, surely they would appreciate my business. The ALWAYS forget something out of your order.... Like 100% of the time. It could be something like a whole burger order or an extra ranch that you PAY for. They tie up the bags so tight that its almost impossible to check your order before you leave. I called today after they forgot something I PAID FOR out of my order. The \"manager\" Maribel sounded clueless and admitted they forgot it, as it was still sitting on the counter. I asked her why this happens all the time \"its cuz were busy\"... no customer service skills. I asked her managers name, she said she could not give it. I don't want his home address, just his first name. I can't tell you his name she says.... Marcia's has been in SO Phoenix for close to or over 20 years and their customer service is to assume that people who are patrons to their business deserve sub-par service. Tell everyone you know.... I will!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years it's my favorite place to eat wings! I love very far but drive at least once a month to go eat wings here! Unfortunately my last experience on Friday was HORRIBLE!!! The customer service is none the girls and the cook are rude. They messed up my order and then didn't want to fix it correctly. The portions are getting smaller and smaller. Might have to find another wing place"}
{"text":"Went into long wongs again bc I just don't have many options when it comes to wings. I told the girl taking my order about the missing wings on two prior visits to this location. She told me I should have called about the missing wings. I said I didn't want to sound ridiculous about missing a wing. It wasn't worth the trip to pick up a single wing etc. Anyway it happened more than once and because I really wanted wings I was willing to forgive as long as I had a chance to vent. So I paid for a dozen honey hot wings and the nice girl who initially did not offer any discounts or extra wings, went in the back and explained to the cooks my situation. This was very kind of her to do. So the cooks or owners as it seemed gave me an amazing 20 total wings for the 9 bucks I reluctantly paid on this occasion. I was more than pleased about this particular event and think they deserve the 5 star review. The wings were delicious and now I will make it a point to count my wings before I leave each time. Thank u long wongs, u made my night."}
{"text":"It took me this long to find out but it's true!!! Their wings are really as bomb as everyone says! We stopped in at 10pm on a Friday to order some wings to go. Nothing else was open in that area that really appealed to me.. I ordered 8 of their honey hot wings (you can't do 1/2 and 1/2, unfortunately) and took them to my moms. I thought I'd be the only one enjoying them but my family members tried some and we were all hooked!!! Such amazing flavor, the sauce is phenomenal! And they are nice and crispy (just how I like it!) a little priced for wings, but not any pricier that B-Dubs or Wingstop. It is definitely a hole-in-the-wall kind of restaurant. Buf if you're looking for good wings, this is the spot! By the way, they have lots of other stuff too, not just wings! But the name can be a little deceiving... no Chinese food here lol"}
{"text":"If you plan on ordering food online prepare to speak to a smart ass girl on the phone. She was really rude and I'm not sure how she still has a job there. I've been coming here since I was little when they had a hidden bar in back room and that kind of behavior shouldn't be there. 

Anyways, I always get the family special here that comes with garlic bread, carrots, wings, fries and ranch. For some reason they started serving little bag of fries for one person so prepare to fight over them, unless you order a box of fries. 

Overall, needs improvement on the customer service side but the food is great."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to this place it hasn't disappointed. The service is great, the food is on point, the wings are delicious. A little run down appearance wise, but food and service 5/5. I'm glad we have this in South Phoenix."}
{"text":"loved my options  and made  a great  choice  i didn't  see many  photos  so i posted  my items.  loved  it and newly  remodeled"}
