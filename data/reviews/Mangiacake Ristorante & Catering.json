{"text":"Mangiacake is near the AGO, so I stopped in for a quick cafe au lait, after seeing the David Bowie exhibit (until Nov 27 - must see!). The owner Raj and his staff are the best - welcome everyone with a smile. I look forward to coming back for lunch soon."}
{"text":"We went here randomly for breakfast but arrived a little past 11 so we missed it. But we were still out and about wiling to explore the menu. We ordered 2 coffee's and a cookie,. Service was great though. The place is kind of small. It felt very Italian even with me having overlooked that it was Italian. The cream in my coffee wouldn't mix so they changed everything for me. Everything was ok with this place and they had a decent lunch menu but we went elsewhere for lunch since we just didn't feel connected to the place."}
{"text":"Mangiacake funny restaurant name, growing up in up North in the Italian hood you know what this means and the mythical story to go along with it. lol

Feeling like a panini in around China town?  Bizarre but not really as it's at the extreme border close to the Art Gallery of Ontario. Just a block north. 

We split two paninis, one with chicken breast and brie the other was a turkey with tomato. Too bad they weren't grilled on the outside like one's at Cafe Supreme but the taste was alright. 

Nice atmosphere, cute ceiling bulbs and chandelier, wood floors, chalk written menus, restaurant is in one of the converted standard Victorian 3 story row houses so it's got character. Washrooms upstairs, main restaurant eating area in the front, kitchen in the back. 

Good selection of sandwiches and home cooked pasta dishes like a lasagna, and soups. Fast and friendly service. 

A panini and soup was perfect for a -7 degree day in Toronto. It hit the spot. :)"}
{"text":"This place was so cute. Such a nice atmosphere and interior. The food was good, simple and classic. Not too special for the area, but I would definitely visit again. I got the antipasto with two types of salads and the grilled vegetables. The small was not a lot of food but it was the right amount for the price. The coffee is really good, and so are the paninis. They messed up my boyfriend's order, he ordered a sandwich without cheese and it came with cheese, fine but could be better."}
{"text":"Came to this shop from a voucher deal and positive reviews at the time I saw the deal online.

Came on a sunny Saturday around 1:30 pm. The place is small, casual and one of those that was converted from a Victorian house. It wasn't very busy at the time. Not sure if there's another patio in the back but we took seats in the front patio, which was small, only seat 2 pairs. But it was nice as it was under a tree and next to small flower beds and you some people watching as they come along the sidewalk on this quiet street.

The daily special panini that day, which was pulled pork panini, was sold out at the time, so we just order straight from the menu. We got a steak panini and a salmon panini. Each plate came with 2 olives and a simple vinigrette salad on the side.

We enjoyed our paninis. Tasty and the breads were toasted to perfection. We had our paninis with olive breads, as oppose to white or wholewheat, which I thought was a more special choice and more flavorful.

The salads were also quite good. I wasn't sure if it was balsamic as I normally don't like balsamic because of the smell. But I find the smell for this one not at all repulsive.

Overall, this is a nice little joint for a small casual meal. They had cakes/desserts and coffees, but we didn't get any during this visit so I can't judge those.

The thing I do like most is the service. The owner Raj was an attentive and jolly fellow. He served us personally and informed us with details of their specials. He was also very apologetic for not being able to provide the daily special panini as they were sold out of the pulled pork. By the time we were ready for the bill, the owner wasn't around and the girl that attended to us was also quite friendly. We tipped 20% and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Ah, Mangiacake.  Was that you that I heard beckoning pale little me, from across the street at lunch today?  Well, here's my answer.  
  Small, cute cafe/sandwich outfit, with a petite patio (yes, it's that small) out front.  Service today was exceedingly friendly.  As in, we're lonely, come and see us!  Have a panini!  No, come back!  Pleeaassse!   Which, I suppose is better than the gate keeper reception I've received at other, lesser, establishments.  
  I found the menu to be bit busy.  The lettering in the menu board, as with the tiny take away menus is really small.  It's as if you should already know what you are about to order before you walk in to receive your excess greeting.  
  Ok, ok, ok.  What did I eat?  Soup and half panini lunch special.  I enjoyed the Woodbridge Panini and a side if a lemon basil basmati soup.  The panini was neatly pressed, with a good sluce of provolone, some salami, and I think, ham. You have a choice of bread- I just guessed, and announced 'olive'.  What else is available?  I have no idea.  Note: mini script on the menu.  The soup was light and lemony, without being too tart, but was lacking the promised basmati rice.  A few spare grains were tossed in, but looked lonely, swimming about the bottom of the bowl.  However, for a tidy $8, I say, not bad."}
{"text":"Finally! After so many times passing by this place, I got to go Mangiacake Ristorante for lunch with a few of my former co-workers for my birthday lunch.

It's a really cute little restaurant with seating in the front, and some seating in the back. I had ordered mysel the special, which I believe, was a pulled pork sandwich (unfortunately, my mind is drawing a blank, because I ate there about a month and a half ago -- this is what happens when you don't yelp right away!)

Anyhow, food was great, service was absolutely awesome. The people there had helped my coworkers light up some candles and sang happy birthday to me that day (although, the candles had actually made the fire alarm go offf. Whoops!)

Will definitely come back for a lunch some time soon."}
{"text":"Mangiacake is a great little cafe, specializing in paninis. I used to eat lunch here a lot when I was working at Mount Sinai Hospital. It's also a good place to eat if you are visiting the AGO. 
They have a small patio out front (on McCaul) and a bigger patio in the back. Staff are really warm and personable. They're always happy to make recommendations and kindly moved me from the patio to an indoor table when tons of bees started surrounding me once my food arrived!! (They were very apologetic about the bees!). 
There are tons of yummy, fresh paninis with names like \"Vespa\" and \"Woodbridge\". Portions are pretty big. You can add a salad and there are so many to choose from: chick pea salad, mushrooms, tomato/bocconcini, etc. Soups are also great in the winter. I also recommend their arangini (italian-style risotto ball, fried and served with tomato sauce -- amazing!). I don't think it is on the regular menu, but they offer it occasionally as a daily special. 
All in all, a great little lunch spot in a nice location!"}
{"text":"My relationship with this tiny McCaul street cafe is scant though I have been here a million times. I come in, I grab a coffee, I plunk down my laptop, try the wifi (it never works), hang out for about an hour, and then leave. In the days, it's never very busy so it's actually a pretty decent place to relax and read.

They have a patio and a back seating area. It could actually fit a surprising number of people. Mangiacake serves breakfast, paninis (obvs), salads, soups, and desserts but I've never worked up the nerve to try anything.

But insofar as it's a coffeeshop and quiet place to chillax, this place is ALL right. I will have to come back and eat something sometime.

Obligatory Title Pun: Yo, that word is a slur. Isn't anyone else outraged?

Menu Readability: Chalkboard, but get this: tiny lettering.

Need to mention: Washrooms are upstairs, which is kind of unheard of in this city. 

What this place teaches me about myself: Am I paninophobic?"}
