{"text":"NO STARS were deserved!  A group of about 12 of us ate here and have never had such a terrible experience. The waitress??  took our drink orders and eventually came back for our meal orders. Sill no drinks served. We saw our orders on the shelf waiting to be picked up. Watching them sit and get colder and colder while we got madder and madder. Still no drinks either. I should mention there was only one couple finishing their meal when we got there so it was not busy at all. Finally she brought a couple orders, the first being a cold sandwich instead of the hot food waiting. Still no drinks. Then  the owner/manager? started bringing some of the food. The waitress?? then took about 15 minutes figuring out how to fill a glass with water or iced tea serving them 2 at a time. She kept running back to the cash register for some reason.  The rest of the food finally arrived except mine as it was not prepared for some reason.Some of the dinners were COLD! They were taken back and partially reheated with one I know of still being cold inside again. I was given a salad to compensate for not getting my food. When I got my eggplant parmesan at least it was fresh and hot. It was filled with ricotta that was strange. Very soft and runny. It did not taste like ricotta at all. Then my friend and I were charged more that the others so we went to the owner who had the nerve to tell us that we ordered from the dinner menu!  We all had the same lunch menus and never saw the dinner menu until he waved it in our face. He very very grudgingly changed the price. Beware of this place."}
{"text":"Best pizza that I've had so far in the Phoenix area!  It's not what you'd expect if you're looking at the place when driving by. Glad I gave this place a chance! The bruschetta and pepperoni are delicious!"}
{"text":"A 2nd visit that was just as good as the first! We tried the pasta this time and it was tasty, filling, and priced great. Even though we arrived 20 minutes after the \"lunch\" specials ended, then server offered them to us anyway. A nice, friendly touch."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the House Specialty pizza and the bruschetta.  The pizza was delicious!  We loved the crust, sauce, and toppings.  The only thing I would change about it is the mushrooms.  I prefer fresh sliced mushrooms and these seemed to be out of the can.  The bruschetta was also very yummy!  It's nice to have a good local pizza place in the neighborhood!  We will be back and look forward to trying the pasta dishes as well."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! This was the first visit for my husband and myself.  We were at the MIM (Musical Instrument Museum) and decided to get dinner afterwards, I did a search on Yelp  and Pezzano's was right up the road, thought we would try it out.  I got the stuffed eggplant parmigiana and my husband got a sub.  My eggplant was cooked perfectly and the ricotta was silky and smooth.  The pasta was perfect and the sauce was very good!! My husband's sub was fresh and very tasty (of course I had to have at least a bite!).  The garlic bread that came with my eggplant was awesome!! It just melts in your mouth and it was LOADED with garlic, which is alright by me, I'm a huge garlic lover!!  Our server was very friendly, outgoing and humorous - adding to wonderful experience at Pezzano's.  We don't live anywhere near that side of town, but we will FOR SURE be going back soon....and frequently!!"}
{"text":"We've lived in this area for awhile, and have been bummed at the lack of decent restaurants close by. 

Problem. Solved. Pezzanos is in an unassuming little spot in an office type complex. Pizza? Phenomenal. Thin crust, flavorful crust and just the right amount of cheese. Our lunch portions of pasta were HUGE. The meatballs have a beautiful texture and are delicately seasoned. Penne with broccoli? Yes. 


We were served by the restaurant manager who is attentive, and hysterically funny. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable!! I was a little reluctant because of the perfect score Pezzano's had. Wow, it lived up to the score. Staff is great and the owner comes by to make sure you are happy with the food. Holy crap the food!! By far the best and most authentic Italian food I have ever eaten. This man cuts no corners and you can taste it in every bite! It was strange that we were the only ones in there because of the quality. I felt like Adam Richman describing the orgy of flavors and textures that were exploding into my mouth. Yes, it really was that good. 

If you want an amazing, authentic Italian meal. You owe it to yourself to eat here. I had the fettuccine alfredo and my wife said the eggplant parm is to die for. I actually signed up for yelp so I could leave this review after having the app for over a year. I will be coming back! No question."}
{"text":"Pezzano ha thr migliore pizza. MI mancheranno Pezzano's."}
{"text":"Full out authentic Italian pizza. The chef had the Italian accent and the food was cheap but also delicious"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Phoenix and probably the whole southwest. Amazing meatballs and pizza, pasta is unbelievable, fantastic hot sandwiches... everything is so fresh and delicious. The service is perfection and the prices and portions are so reasonable. Very friendly and comfortable atmosphere. You've got to try this place, it's a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Really good New York Style Pizza. The best Meatball Parmesan Hero as well. They even speak Italian to each other, reminds me of home."}
{"text":"Back again! Very good pappardelle bolognese! The pizza is always great too! Nice neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"I recently moved here from New York City and I have tried a number of pizzerias in the north Phoenix area. This place is undoubtedly the best and comes close to New York City slice. Close enough that this will be my go to pizzeria. I haven't tried any of their other items but I've had a pizza delivered and I've picked up the pizza.  both times I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"We ordered for the first time tonight. The guy on the other end couldn't have been nicer. My boyfriend picked up the pizzas and said the decor was nice. The pizzas themselves were really, really good. We had the Pezzanos Special which was super good and his kids and a half cheese and half pepperoni which could've used more pepperoni,  but other  than that was good too. 

Give this place a shot some time. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! Friends recommended it. Yelp reviewers recommended it. We had to try it. This little, unassuming restaurant,  located in a strip mall beside PVCC serves the best Italian food I have had in years! The owner was very friendly. We said we wanted to start with the bruschetta and he suggested we order the small plate, since we were planning to follow it with entrees. It was delicious!  Next,  I had clam linguine: loaded with clams in a natural sauce (refreshingly,  not alfredo sauce), atop a huge portion of homemade linguine. My husband had the equally impressive chicken parm which, he said,  was excellent because the chicken wasn't too thick or too thin or overbreaded. We were the only people in the restaurant at 5pm on a Monday but, during the hour we spent there, 6 people collected take-out orders and 2 other families arrived to eat-in. We will go back. ... soon!"}
{"text":"I must be crazy or my taste buds off. I thought the food was pretty tasteless . I've tried the baked Ziti, fettuccini , and pizza. I make a better fettuccini sauce .... Service was good...but a little to good. The waiter in my opinion was over to much. Started to bug me. So unfortunately I don't think I'll go back ."}
{"text":"So we ordered this place for take out based off the other strong reviews.. We got a pepperoni pizza which was ok and the bruschetta which was disappointing.  It was drowning in oil and there was no liner in the box so it was an oily nightmare. I was really looking forward to that bruschetta too.. ugh.. The owner seemed very nice  but they don't take Amex, which is annoying, so all and all we probably won't be back.  I wanted to try some other stuff on the menu that looked good but we were pretty disappointed so probably stick with our normal Pizza/Italian joints in the future.."}
{"text":"Three stars because my first visit about a year ago was 4 stars and my visit on 4/24/15 was 1 star.  

So as not to be too lengthy..here's a list from last visit.

1) Had to walk thru cigarette/cigar smoke to enter the restaurant.
2) The smoke was being drafted into the building because the front door was propped open so there was a haze of smoke and stink in the eating area.
3) The server was friendly but completely overwhelmed and ineffective with three tables and to-go orders being picked up.
4) I ordered a Peroni and bruscetta while I waited and decided on a to-go order. After several minutes, server returned to say they had no Peroni.  I settled for another beer. 
5) So much time passed that a friend went to find out if my order for to-go was going to be taken. Finally another server who had just come on shift, arrived to help me. 
6) I asked for extra mushrooms on to-go pizza and server never wrote it down or told the guys in the kitchen ( I could hear everything she was yelling to them)
7) My bruschetta never did come.  When the to-go order arrived, I cancelled the bruschetta
8) The chicken parm. to-go was packaged in flimsy styrofoam so the very greasy sauce leaked out in the bag on the way home.  There are much better packaging options for meals with sauce. The pasta in the order was very mushy and grainy.
9) The veggie pizza is made with canned mushrooms - nasty.  Good thing I didn't get the extra mushrooms I asked for. Whew.
10) Finally...and this is not the restaurants fault, necessarily, but the table of two next to me was occupied by a wacked out woman who was loud and had a very foul mouth with the F-bomb in nearly every sentence.

Really a bad experience from beginning to end.  Can't imagine ever returning to this place with so many other options."}
{"text":"Love this place. we got the pasta and it was so good to Bruschetta was good too. I went back a second time just to get the bruschetta. Today were going to get pizza and I know it will be so delicious. Can't wait to try more pasta and pizza"}
{"text":"GReat service great pizza and really enjoyable. THe staff was fantastic and the cook/chef checked on us! We will be back and have been twice! Come out and support this Pops and Pops place!"}
{"text":"I'm back !! The crust is to tasty to stay away !  Get sum ! If your in a rush jus pick it up there fast !"}
{"text":"Oh man, that was some good pizza. 

My buddy and I picked up a veggie pie for the Cardinals game and these guys make a serious pizza.  at 16 bucks for an extra large it's not super expensive either.  Their cheese was authentic and delicious.  The sauce was rich and flavorful and their crust was just the right amount of crunchy and doughy. 

We called ahead and our order was done in the promised 15 minutes when we arrived to pick it up.  I will definitely be getting more pizza from here."}
{"text":"Once again, they outdone themselves! They have now created smaller version of the bruschetta that allows me to order it every time!!!! Gotta try it.."}
{"text":"the BEST Italian food in the area!  Love the Pasta and Pizza.  you MUST check this place out"}
{"text":"What a find! Had lunch here with my choir director and his family last Sunday, and will definitely be coming back. It wasn't the easiest place to locate, in fact I had to drive around the block a couple of times before I saw it. (It's in the little strip mall behind the Circle K on the northwest corner of 32nd street and Union Hills; there's a sign on the marquee, but no sign on the restaurant itself!) Outside it's nothing special but inside it is nicely decorated in the style of many mom-and-pop Italian places, with a medley of Frank Sinatra tunes playing in the background. 

And the food! Everything here is apparently made from scratch, and you can really tell. Our table split the bruschetta appetizer, which was not like any other bruschetta I have had. Basically a pizza-type crust piled high with diced tomatoes and fresh basil tossed in olive oil, cut and served in pizza-like slices. The olive oil soaked nicely into the crispy-chewy crust and the flavors of fresh tomato and basil really stood out. I had the antipasto della casa as my entree - I should have taken a picture, it was almost too pretty to eat! Artfully arranged, curled slices of salami and provolone, surrounded by thin slices of ham, on top of a bed of fresh greens, olives, sun-dried tomatoes and peppers tossed with a delicious homemade dressing. The rest of the party shared a pizza (large half-pepperoni and half-sausage) and while I did not try any, I can say that it looked and smelled delicious and everyone else was raving about how good it was!

We were waited on by the owner and he could not have been friendlier or more accommodating - he refilled my iced tea glass 5 times! (With a little good-natured teasing - yeah, I guess I was a bit thirsty that day.) We skipped dessert but I can't wait to bring my hubby back here to try their tiramisu, not to mention their pizza and pasta dishes. I love finding little out-of-the-way places like Pezzano's Pizza! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"When I walked in I was a little apprehensive, there is kinda a funky smell in the eating area but the food was pretty great.  I looove their crust.  I had the pepperoni and also the house special, the house special was fantastic.  My son loved the pepperoni.  My only complaints:  it took a while to get our food and the pizza was a little over greasy (to the point of being liquidy at some spots.  None of that will keep me from going back though!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The sauce is out of this world as is the homemade pasta. Looks like the tomatoes are from Italy. Yummy."}
{"text":"Just moved back to Phoenix and saw the reviews for Pezzano's in the neighborhood.  I ordered their house special and the bruschetta.  Quick turnaround on the order, 15-20 minutes and the staff was pleasant enough.  As for the food, I was blown away by the bruschetta and it was surprisingly filling.  I only had a couple slices of the pizza, which was a pretty solid pie, but I think the bruschetta will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Wow! My husbands idea to come to pezzanos. And it did not disappoint. The manager/waiter/hostess/busser gentleman was very nice and he made the place very welcoming. 

We had bruschetta and like all the other reviews say- it's amazing! Fresh and delish! The put fresh basil on the bruschetta. :)
We also had the Caesar salad- nothing spectacular but it was ok. 
We had the veggie pizza and the white pizza- from our table we could see the dough being tossed. It was really neat. 

We will definitely come back and try some pasta dishes. They are def under staffed but maybe when they get busier they will add more people. 

The bathrooms were clean except I think the place needs quite some work and detailing."}
{"text":"If you love your food drowning in garlic this might be the place for you. My husband ordered the meatball calzone and this was his first mistake. It was a far cry from what a real calzone should taste like. Chopped frozen meatball drowning in ricotta cheese is not my idea of good. He couldn't eat it and sent it back. Then ordered a meatball sub and this was a bit better but very tasteless aside from the overwhelming amount of garlic. I ordered the lasagne and was also disappointed with the flavorless meal except for the taste of garlic that didn't leave our mouths for hours after the meal. We also ordered lemonade and upon completing our first glass we were told that they didn't have any more lemonade and that we would have to order something else. What?!?! Needless to say we certainly will not be going back to this place. If I could give less then one star I would. Avoid this place if you don't want to be sick to your stomach after eating."}
{"text":"We had reservations today for a large group.  The reservations were for 15, but there were only enough seats for 11.  We had to get ourselves more chairs.  The \"waitress\" brought menus and took our drink orders.  She went away and came back and took our food orders.  No drinks yet  She put the food orders in.  Still no drinks.  The food was up on the serving station.  Still no drinks.  The food sat on the serving station for 20 minutes.  Still no drinks.  No food.  (water isn't a hard drink)  Finally some food started coming out.  No drinks.  First round of food delivered was cold.  More food came out.  No drinks.  Food orders wrong.  Sent back.  AHHH   Water being delivered!  Cold food was sent back.  Burned calzone   Antipasto with boiled ham??  ugh    
Never saw waitress again until check time.  She was putting checks down and I asked if we were allowed to get dessert.  She said yes.  I asked why she was delivering checks without asking. Oh, you want dessert?  good grief    Several people ordered the same thing.  One lady was charged for the dinner portion, but she got the same as the others.   The waitress said that she was given the dinner portion.  Diner informed her that she didn't order the dinner and that it was the same as the other two people.  
Did I mention that there was no one else in the restaurant the entire time except for our group?  On the way out, one diner said that it was the worst service that she has ever received.  The \"waitress\" made a face at this person and rolled her eyes, commenting that she is only one person.  Her tips?  next to nothing    Some left her NO tip at all.  She didn't deserve any tips.  
The one diner who said that it was the worst service ever did not even hit the nail on the head.  There is no describing the service.
It was our first time there and it is truly the very last time.
I hope people read the reviews and take them seriously."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight, it was delicious. All we got was a cheese pizza, because, if they can't do that well, why bother trying anything else right!? My kiddo ate two whole slices and said \"okay, this is SO good\" about ten times. 

We will definitely be going back!!  Not sure why it has the two dollar signs, ten bucks for a 14 inch pizza is cheap!

Try it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor!  Excellent food with fast and friendly service!  We've been there twice in one weeks time. Salad dressing is to die for. Pizza has a great crunch to it  meatballs....delicious"}
{"text":"I love , love , love  Pezzano's !    I have a real hankering for New york Style pizza at times and now I am thrilled to know there is a pizza place that can satisfy my craving. Mom and Pop shops hold a special place in my heart and this little hidden jewel is one of them. The owner is a sweetheart who is engaging and personable. makes it feel like you hanging out in your Friends parents kitchen .
They have a killer White Pizza ( Ricotta and Mozzarella no red sauce )  that is too die for.  Did i mention I love it? 
Oh by the way I dare you to try their Bruschetta . it's tasty enough to be a meal in it's self!   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The pizza is great! Flavorful sauce, quality cheese, AWESOME crust, and the slices are pretty decently sized. Great place for lunch- quick, clean, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great deal! The owner was super nice and told us to come back for the pasta. My boyfriend and I will definitely regular this place =)"}
{"text":"Today I got the shrimp ravioli special and the boo got the Trio. It was delicious! 
SHRIMP RAVIOLI SPECIAL $16.99-a lot of sauce, two huge ravioli's stuffed with cheese and 3 large butterfly shrimps with tail still attached in a creamy sauce! I ate it ALL!!! Oh and a glass of moscato! 
TRIO $11.99- it came with eggplant parmigiana, lasagne and fettuccine. Out of those 3 the boyfriend enjoyed the fettuccine the most it hard a creamy sauce. 
Garlic bread was good and filling. Our waiter Tony was great he was a character! Made us feel comfortable and was at our table when we needed something instantly! We will def be coming back!
Oh I can't forget the $1.99 salad, the boyfriend actually got that and liked it he stated it got better at the bottom!"}
{"text":"Here for the first time. Not overly busy. Have to wait on pizza 20 minutes because they ran out of mozzarella for the pizza and have to go buy some. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I love this place !  The food here is delicious, and very authentic Italian.  There is no skimping here when it come to the finest ingredients.  The pizza is cooked to perfection, with a really nice crust. The Egg Plant is to die for.  Prices are very reasonable too. The Owner Cosimo is really a great guy, does most of the cooking himself, but always finds the time to come and greet his guest.  The Manager Tanino is your host for the evening, He will take excellent care of you, never have to ask for anything from him, he hast it all covered, and never leaves your glass empty.  He makes it a point to remember your name, and will greet you by that on your next visit guaranteed. The Restaurant itself is immaculate, and comfortable with an \"Old World\" charm.   Try this place once, and you'll never eat Italian anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Great alfredo!  Staff is very friendly and helpful. We have been there several times and it is consistantly great!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place doesn't rate higher in my book is due to the fact that the owner sits outside and smokes in front of the building. And because the door is left wide open the smell wafts in, it makes sitting in the dining room unpleasant. 

The food, I must say, is pretty good from my limited experience there. The pizza was delicious and the staff is super friendly. I think maybe take out might be the solution in order to avoid the smokey dining room."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza! Quality far above any pizza chain pizza! Fresh ingredients to die for. A crust that you could enjoy all by itself. Memorable sauce. Flavorful cheese of high-quality. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this pizza joint. Right when we walked in the little old Italian owner greeted us and continued his pacing around singing in Italian. The restaurant was empty, although this doesn't always mean bad food, this time it did. We ordered their \"House Specialty\" pizza which was thin but not too thin, olives, raw white onion chunks(I think they attempted to cook them but they were very raw) black olives, tomato chunks, very dry sausage bits and canned mushrooms. We also got the meatballs. Took everything home to dig in, upon inspection of our order we got two small meatballs for 6 bucks. I wouldn't be adverse to that price if they were amazing, these were not. Very bland and over cooked. The pizza crust was good but needed salt, that was the best part of the pizza. Every bite was dominated by the slimy huge slices of canned mushroom. If you're charging 17 bucks for a pizza please use fresh ingredients. They got the one star for the funny little owner and a crust and sauce that had potential. Everything was just extremely BLAND. We had to use salt, garlic, Italian seasonings, and Parmesan cheese just to make it edible"}
{"text":"Yummy! This place is the real deal.

We ordered a large pizza to go. My husband picked it up and said the guy that runs it is really nice and the atmosphere would be good enough for a date night. 

The pizza has a perfect thin crust, lots of gooey good quality mozzarella, and a tasty sauce. The \"large\" is more of a medium compared to other pizza places but well worth the money. I am slightly ashamed to admit that my husband and I polished off the whole thing in one night. It was that good. 

I really want to try some of their pasta dishes. If the sauce is an indication of how the pasta entrees are then I am in for a treat!

Look for coupons in the Money Mailer- there are some really good deals."}
{"text":"Definitely nothing that it looks like in the picture, ordered to go and the sauce doesn't even resemble tomatoes or marinara, cheese taste cheap. Not a big fan. Not my kind off pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered a to-go pizza last night for the first time after catching some good reviews about this place (it was Lucky's the last time I was at this location many years ago!) and I do not regret my decision at all!! They were totally great about my order (I asked them to take longer since I had guests coming over and I wanted the pizza to stay warm) and the pizza was delicious! I ordered a cheese with half pineapple and light on the sauce. That's what I got!! The only reason I hadn't given this 5 stars was because I really was hoping the slices would be a tad larger. I'm from Queens so I'm so used to the large slices you can fold and eat. Other than that, this place rocked and I WILL be back! Looked very nice and classy on the inside too :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered out from Pezzano's for the first time. At 6:10 on a Friday it was only a 15 minute wait. We got the Hawaiian pizza and bruschetta. The Hawaiian was good and the cheese was the freshest I've ever had. It was kind of oblong shape, so I know they had just hand thrown the crust. The bruschetta was warm and dripping with olive oil. Honestly, I could have done with a little less olive oil and more basil, but everything was incredibly fresh and the guys working there were super cool."}
{"text":"Eat here with my Father and Family every few weeks.  Outstanding food and Service.
The employees and owner are wonderful.

The special seafood pasta I had one week was Delicious and they did not skip on the sea food at all !  Big Full sized Shrimp, muscles, and calamari. The owner told me it was spicy and I told him that is exactly how I like it.

Give this place a try and you won't regret it !"}
{"text":"Just ordered for the first time. Got a large cheese pizza and chicken Alfredo to go. It was a mixed experience. For me in the end it comes down to the food. The actual Alfredo sauce was not very good and tasted like a whole stick of butter. Now the chicken itself was good and prepared well. The garlic bread however has now left me with garlic breath for the next couple days as there was beyond excess garlic on it. In the end the pizza was actually done extremely well and although it is quite greasy, the cheese itself is really good as it comes apart while you bite into it, and I must say the crust was the best part.  All in all I will be trying them again, definitely the pizza however I don't think I will try their pasta again."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from here twice now, REALLY like the crust. We have only had the House, haven't ventured out past that, but TONS of toppings and the crust is still crunch not soggy, Love it! Definitely recommend trying it if you havent and are in the area!"}
{"text":"As of January 2015 it is the best pizza and Italian food I've had in the valley.  It is truly a hidden Gold mine of taste."}
{"text":"We recently moved to this area and have thoroughly enjoyed this local pizza joint.  Great friendly staff for dine in. No delivery yet their take out has always been really fast. 

Pizza is in the New York style: slightly thin and not overly doughy crust. Great selection of toppings yet we have stuck to the sausage, which some of the best we have had. 

Glad we have a local pizza place of such great quality and can't wait to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"After perusing pizza places in the N Phoenix area, I found this hidden gem (thanks Yelp!). I needed some food to bring to my mom who lives up in this area. We ordered a cheese pizza (14 inch for 10 bucks... can't beat it) and an order of bruschetta (7$ ish). The man who was working there (the owner?) was really friendly and they had our pizza ready in 15 minutes. The pizza itself was surprisingly good. Very classic NY style pizza with a good sauce to cheese ratio. The sauce was also nicely seasoned and flavorful. The bruschetta was good, but a bit on the greasy side. The flavors were nice despite this and the bread did not get soggy, so that was good. If I were in the area, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure a little locally-owned pizza/pasta place could really get any better. In fact, it was higher than my expectations.
See, I just took a cross-country trip with my friend Jimmy. We made a road trip movie. Anyway, almost a month on the road means you eat a lot of pizza. Some of it was passable, but most of it wasn't. We are both originally from the East coast, so we know pizza. We are both from different parts of Upstate NY. We *know* pizza. He had been raving about this place for a few weeks, so we decided to have a business meeting there.
It's in a non-descript strip mall in North Phoenix, just like everything else up there. But as soon as you walk in, you realize it's not just a strip mall eatery. The decor is crisp, but warm. There's not a lot of clutter anywhere in this place. The tables are nice, as are the chairs. It just feels cleaner than a pizza joint.
We started out with the bruschetta. My mouth is watering, because the leftovers are in a box on my cupboard. It is served as a pizza, cut into slices. It's LOADED with olive oil, fresh garlic, and freshly topped tomatoes. The dough is chewy and crisp, just the way I like it. But what really made the whole thing pop? The salt. It had the right amount of salt. I hate when people don't salt stuff. Salt and olive oil, in fact, is one of my very favorite combinations of all time. There was enough olive oil to sop up on the plate with the crust from the bruschetta. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I can't wait to eat the pieces sitting there, waiting for me.
We ordered a pepperoni pizza, slightly burnt. It. Was. Perfect. When they brought it out, and I saw that little amount of grease on top, I knew it was going to make me cry. It almost did. It was that good. They use fresh ingredients, including the cheese. It was ooey and gooey and perfect. I even had grease dripping down my hand, which is a sure sign of a real pizza pie!
They carry Pepsi products, too. I never drink pop that late in the day (I like sleeping), but I couldn't resist.
Dessert was tiramisu, of course. It wasn't heavy like some I've had. It was perfectly spongy.
There's a TV behind the bar area, too.
You have to go check this place out. The owners are super friendly. They are also very clean. As soon as I took the wrapper off my straw, they came and threw it out. A piece of lettuce on the table was gotten rid of immediately, too. 
I'm going to go dig into that bruschetta now."}
{"text":"Finally... Pizza in Phoenix that has good crust !
Best Pizza I've had in Phoenix for quite some time. 
They make the pasta for the Ravioli and Lasagna in house.
Good sauce. Good meatballs. Innovative take on Brushetta.
Experienced staff. They will have a full bar available by the end of November.
I look forward to exploring the menu..
Worth a try."}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant has the misfortune of being situated in a strip mall that has a DES satellite office, a Circle K in the front, a barber shop, Physical therapist, Marcel's bar, and not much else. Signage is bad. There are little signs one would miss that advertise their 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $4.99 but as to where in the strip mall they are, one can not see it without a huge neon blinking sign. I think their business is dumb luck or patrons of the strip mall tenants which is a shame! I visited this place today about 11:45am. As I pulled up, the cashier was standing right outside the doorway, smoking. Not cool. (I didn' appreciate butt-breath as he was taking my order). I was the only one in the restaurant. The decor is modern and it is clean, bright, and simple. There is a basic, behind-the-counter bar, with a few stools set up. There are about eight four-time tables. I asked for the advertised special. I wanted a slice of pepperoni and a slice of cheese, along with a diet Pepsi.YEAH for that - no none seems to carry Pepsi products in this town! I only waited about 5-7 minutes and got my box. I did not open to check it because how hard is it to mess up the order - I'm the only one there.  I thought the box wasn't too terribly hot. I drove the two miles to my home, threw my keys on the table, washed up for lunch, sat down and WOA! You have got to be freaking kidding me? Two pieces of pepperoni. And, it was lukewarm (mind you, we all know how a pizza comes to us with melty cheese in a cardboard box and ten minutes later it is still hot magma? My trip took me less than that! ) I proceeded to at least try the first piece unreheated. The crust was thin and crisp, and the sauce was a tad heavy but had just the right amount of basil and garlic. The pepperoni was, however, a greasy, undercooked mess. I have never seen so much grease leech through a cardboard box. The entire top of the pizza was undercooked, but the bottom and outer crust were perfection. Had they married the two, this lunch would have been a \"wowza\". Reheating the second piece only made the pizza worthy of the trash can.  Note to self-government this place another try, but order the pasta next, hold the smoke! I hope this locale does well for such a weird location. I'm going to give them another shot."}
