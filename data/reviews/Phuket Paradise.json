{"text":"Amazing value for afternoon lunch that can't be beat. Huge portions that include either a spring roll or a soup. Surprising the coconut chicken soup was really great and definitely made for a good appetizer. If your looking to get the best bang for your buck in thornhill, this place is it."}
{"text":"Phuket Paradise....what can I say about this place? 

Well...one thing is that it's definitely far from paradise..hahaha...It's a pretty basic place...looks like it's from the 90's. 
For the lack of Thai restaurants in Richmond Hill I have been to this place several times...sometimes to pick up take out and sometimes for lunch. 

Some dishes like their cold spring rolls are pretty awesome and the tom yum soup is good. However I'm not really crazy about anything else in that place. Their main dishes like Pad Thai and other noodles and rice dishes are just okay... too much sauce or weird sauce flavour....I ordered stir fry veggies and it was practically raw, the sauce they used was kinda gross, so I didn't even eat the dish. 

Bottom line...I don't think I will be back...unless I get an order of take out of their cold spring rolls...They are pretty awesome , like I have mentioned! ;) 

The service is fast and good...nothing special."}
{"text":"I like this place. The food is decent enough, service is not so bad considering it never gets that full (that fact should tell me something) The only reason I come here is because they have a chicken version of szechuan szechuan's crispy ginger beef which I really like. This has to be the only reason I visit.

I've had several other dishes such as pad thai, mango salad, green curry beef and each one has been pretty average. Not great but not bad.
Come to think of it, I'd give a 2 for most dishes"}
{"text":"I come here for one thing and it's amazing every. single. time. The damn creamy curry.
Usually if you get it with a meat it also comes with string beans.  I ask them to sub out the meat out for eggplant and it is just perfecttttt.  The curry is mild and is legit one of my favs in toronto. The portion size is also HUGE here. it'shard to finish the dinner portion on your own. 
I should note that the place is kind of grimey though, nothing fancy, but you won't care once you try the curry!"}
{"text":"My favorites: coconut soup, green curry shrimp, ice tea latte thing they make, and mango salad.

Big portions!"}

It's very obvious that this place is Chinese run, given that they don't realize how funny their name can be, and that they have many Chinese dishes on their menu. Even their receipts have Chinese printings. That should raise some flags in your mind about how authentic this place is. But being the only choice for Thai food in the area, you don't really have a choice. After my first visit, I don't think this place is all bad. Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss.

We ordered a Thai combo for 4 for take out. They said the food will be ready in 10 minutes and they weren't kidding. I arrived about 10 minutes after I placed the call and the food was ready and packaged and sitting on the counter. We took the food home to eat and it pretty much confirmed my suspicions on authenticity. I'll comment on each item.

Red Curry: Best dish of the night and tastes authentic. The dish is loaded with flavor and chicken pieces.

Phad thai chicken: I've had phad thai at many places and there seems to be a wide range of difference. PP's phad thai feels like Chinese stir-fry to me. It seems to be missing some key Thai ingredients. Too light on the fish sauce, not enough eggs, and I think they used onions instead of shallots. 

Basil Beef: I don't feel the basil. It kind of tastes like regular Chinese stir-fry beef with veggies with an added spiciness. Compared with the red curry, the there's a lot less meat in this dish. Not bad, but doesn't feel Thai enough.

Tamarind Shrimp: I never want to eat this dish again. This is not tamarind. This tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce, and not a very well made one.

Their prices aren't cheap, but not outrageously expensive either. The portion size is generous. I would come again, but I'm definitely going to stick with the curries. I suspect this place uses powders for some dishes. I don't see how they could have prepped my meal so quickly otherwise. I'm most disappointed by the Phad Thai and the Tamarind shrimp. But I wouldn't mind ordering a curry again."}
{"text":"Reincarnated from \"Wok on Yonge\", this restaurant has very basic decor, and a huge menu of both Thai and Chinese dishes. My favourite dish is the cold spring rolls appetizer, and I often get the mango salad and Tom Yum (thai lemongrass) soup. I've found the Thai curries vary from tasty to meh, and the Pad Thai is just okay, in my opinion. On the Chinese side, I really liked  the Crispy Ginger Beef - it reminded me of Calgary Ginger Beef, which I sometimes miss! Definitely not the healthiest choice, though.

Service also varies, though it's usually pretty good. More often, I get take-out. Prices seem average given the amount and quality of the food."}
{"text":"The possibility of puns shined bright in my head, but I restrained myself.

Paradise, it ain't, but I went to Phuket, and I liked it.

The place is very non-descript. It is clean, welcoming and bright. The menu is primarily Thai, but they also feature a large number of Chinese dishes.

I had a Thai Coconut infused seafood soup. It came quickly, was nice and hot and had a nice balance of flavour. This is at the core of Thai food, that blend of tastes with the lemon grass assertively tweaking the mix.

As an appetizer, we indulged in the cold rice paper rolls. The dip was very tasty, hut the rolls fell flat. They had an unexciting melange of vegetsbles with cellophane noodles, and not the usual shrimps. I regretted not listening to my wifenas she urged me not to order 2 serving of the appetizer.

As mains we ordered a Green Curry with heef and a Seafood and chicken Pad Thai, with a bowl of steamed rice. The Pad Thai was authentic and good, with a good amount of tamarind to arrive at the right taste and colour. The Green Curry was delicious, with an ample serving of delicious and tender slices of beef. This was a 4 star dish.

We drank Jasmine tea with our meal. Overall the food was good, the portions large and the vibe OK. At $52 before HST it was a bit pricey.This maybe due to the fact that we were charged for 2 teas."}

If I going to rate Phuket Paradise based on their Chicken Pad Thai, It would deserved a 1 star... 

Lunch Special from $6.99 with soup or spring roll. The selections are quite good with both Chinese and Thai fares... Maybe that is NOT a good sign? If a Thai restaurant serving chow mein..?? 

Both the Coconut Soup and Tom Yum Soup were really tasty, especially the Coconut soup which tasted good without being creamy. The Tom Yum is on the sour side, but my Yoga classmate seemed to enjoy that. 

Green Curry Chicken which suppose to be 3 chili spicy lack the spiciness, but I was surprised with all the veggie and the use of white meat in the dish. 

Pad Thai... stay away from Pad Thai.... the only thing is good about it is at least Phuket Paradise didn't use ketchup. But the Tamarind sauce they used tasted blend and the dish is kind of lukewarm not hot from the wok! 

Deco is nice but the whole restaurant smelled like bleach. But maybe I should feel assured that they scrubbed the floor really clean??!"}
{"text":"Not the best experience here. One of the Worst fried rice I've ever had at a Chinese place. Their general Tao chicken tastes a little bit like cheap hot sauce.. Not amazing.. But not HORRIBLE. If no other place is open, this place will do for cheap Chinese in a pinch. Did not like that the owner insisted on a tip when I was ordering take out as well."}
{"text":"Hard to find -Â food is just okay, but portions are gigantic. Considering that you can share one plate among two people, it's great value for the money. Restaurant is never busy, honestly don't know how they're still afloat, but I'm not complaining ... it's tranquil place to grab a bite most weeknights. They do take out too, but portion sizes are smaller.

A long time ago - used to be home to Chopsticks, at the time, Thornhill's only legitimate Chinese restaurant."}
