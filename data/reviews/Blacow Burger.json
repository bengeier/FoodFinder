{"text":"Really high prices for average food.tried this place with my wife for brunch.Let's just say not worth the time.Service was great.Sadly that's the only great part.If I'm going 2 pay $33 for a couple's meal I expect 2 be paying 4 quality food not just quality service because that's what I feel I paid for."}
{"text":"Blacow Burger has been a nice addition to Fort Mill.  The prices could probably be a bit more reasonable (and the service can be a bit slow), but overall we have had nothing but good food served here.  Local beer on tap is a plus (especially when they carry Legal Remedy).  This is our go to burger joint in Fort Mill now that I am vegetarian.  So far, they have the best black bean burger I have had in this area."}
{"text":"Food was great, although they messed up on our order...twice....when it was corrected it was good. I really like the yummy truffle fries!  My only gripe is the price...it's pricey for burgers as fries, but we really did enjoy it!  It's definitely a place is return to every once in a while for a good burger!"}
{"text":"The hangover burger is amazing. And they have a drive-through takeout window. Me and my husband here all the time."}
{"text":"Milkshakes are a little thick and it can be a bit pricey, but otherwise it is a good burger and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot! Friendly staff and delicious burgers! The truffle fries are my favorite as well as a nice creamy milkshake to finish off my meal. Now be careful: you may be in a food coma when you leave!"}
{"text":"Great food! Juicy fresh burgers and best chocolate shake I've ever had. Love the poutine too. Only bad thing about this place is they can't handle volume well. If you go when there is a lot of people, be prepared to wait a long time for the food!"}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich (I know...its a burger joint) is fabulous!  They offer great service and food.  It's a bit pricey for a burger...however it is a step above.  The atmosphere is very hip with lots of attention to details."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family Thursday evening. Service was quick. I had the classic, cooked perfectly, the bun is very good , one of the best I've had. Cheese and bacon fries are very good too. Nice and creamy. Kids gave every thing 2 thumbs up! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Another wonderful burger. Had the classic and it was terrific. The Crispy Balsamic Brussel Sprouts are the best. - top this off with a LRB Alibi and it was a perfect meal.   Wait staff was nice and gave good service."}
{"text":"When i go to a new burger-type place, I like to try whatever spicy burger there is on the menu. The 'Flaming Cow' fit the bill and did well in its intended purpose. After leaving the restaurant I was still enjoying the subtle burn. I ordered the sweet potato fries with it and they were the perfect complement; string sized, were pleasantly crispy with a nice complement of saltiness. The presentation of the fries was inviting to the palate. The wife enjoyed her 'Cabellero' burger with avacado, crisp string onion rings, and bacon. Certainly Blacow beckons me to come back and try my most favorite salad, the Lettuce Wedge Salad."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time today and felt it was good but not outstanding. Lots of things to learn but will be back to try again. First - the smoke. The dining room was pretty filled with it and the bathroom was even worse. Could definitely smell it in my clothes afterwards. The fries were good if not a little greasy and desperately under seasoned. Not a big issue as that is what salt and pepper is for table side. Had the Wagyu burger which was again underseasoned and a tad over cooked. Again, not a huge issue as I can address that next time by ordering it medium rare to rare. The bun was, I fear, a tad stale or maybe just of the firmer variety. Nine if these issues were a huge deal and the 4 stars is because it has huge potential - I would definitely recommend it as I am sure they will get better over time"}
{"text":"It's so heartening to find a non-chain restaurant in this area. I'm here for work and was more than pleasantly surprised to find such a yummy burger. Feeling cheeky, I got the Gangnam burger and upgraded to the wagyu patty. It was awesome! I tried both the cheese fries and parmesan truffle fries, and would lean towards the latter if you had to choose. Also, pretty good beer selection on draught which  doesn't hurt.  I'm here for six more weeks and will definitely be back to try some of the other gourmet burgers."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my wife and had two of the cheapest burgers, two fries and two drinks and it was $25.68. The fries and burgers were pre prepared and under a heat lamp. If you like cold food and high prices you will love this place. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is decent..but $13 for a mediocre burger and fries is a little much. You can get much better quality food in fort mill for the same price."}
{"text":"Updated review!  -- The food is still so perfect and phenomenal!!!  Freshly baked buns... super juicy delicious burgers EVERY SINGLE TIME!!  My favorite is the FLAMING cow!!!  So so so so good!!  I dream about this burger, especially when I'm out of town for a while...!!!  Onion straws are BOMB!!!  Cinnamon sugar shake might be the most delicious milk shake I've ever had the pleasure of drinking !!  I cannot day enough good things about this burger joint!!!  It's just SOOOOOOOO YUMMY & I can't live without it!!  Join the rewards program because after just one taste, you will be back... again ...& again... & again...!!!  SIMPLY DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the pork belly bun and it was amazing!  The bun itself was very soft, the meat was tender and flavorful and the toppings were the perfect touch. We also ordered the truffle fries and they were the best I've ever tasted. Perfectly crispy and seasoned! The mac n cheese was a winner too, our little one gobbled it up :)"}
{"text":"Driving through the area I decided to stop for a Burger. I was looking for a decent sit down restaurant with some good quality burgers but instead found Blacow via Google. My wife and I decided to give it a try since the menu looked pretty interesting. They had a variety of options and the burger variations sounded delicious. Prior to ordering I spoke with the owner and he explained to type of beef used etc. I decided on the Blacow burger and it was awesome. Def would go here again for an inexpensive top quality burger."}
{"text":"Their burgers are very tasty and of good quality, I always get the Flaming Cow, an amazing combo of flavors.Others I have eaten with have chosen varies burger options and have been happy.  The onion rings are excellent and they give you a savory sauce that goes well.  Ordered the truffle fries once and was not impressed-almost a shoestring fry, with minimal truffle flavor, would not spend the extra money again.  Local craft beers on tap is a bonus. Service is upbeat and curteous-order at the counter, they bring you your food to the table and always follow up to see how the food is and to clean empties.  My only complaint, (and this is slight), is that we always ask for medium rare burgers and they are usually cooked medium, the reason we eat the burger instead of sending it back is that it is still flavorful and juicy, but we will continue to work on that medium rare request next time.  As a burger connoisseur, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  Had the classic burger and fries.  The burger was excellent and done perfectly.  The bun was fresh and soft and came grilled.  The vegetables were crisp.  The fries were hot and very tasty.  My wife had the chicken sandwich which she said was moist and delicious.  You order at the counter and then sit down.  The food was delivered fairly quickly to the table.  Overall an excellent choice for lunch."}
{"text":"In town for bmx world's and found this place on yelp. Came here for dinner. Food was great. Good home made onion rings. We had the chili cheese burger and the the classic with grilled chicken. Service was good, tv's throughout the dining room. Menu has something for everyone.  Chocolate shake was delicious."}
{"text":"I'll come back but they've got a lot of learning to do before I wander in the door again. Pricy beef burgers (pretty) but they overcooked the meet to a crispy char. Onion rings were homemade but greasy - cooking oil wasn't hot enough. $14 for lunch with a soda. Good luck!"}
{"text":"We found this place on our way to Charleston,  AWESOME find!! The owner took the time to go through the menu with us and was so nice. The food was AMAZING! Got the special of the day..\"Nutty Goat\", one of the top 10 burgers I've ever eaten, hand cut sweet potato fries were perfect and putine fries were like so good!! Great variety to choose from and such a unique upscale menu for a great price. The atmosphere was fun and modern. Recommended for anyone who loves to go beyond the ol backyard burger.  Definitely a 5 star recommendation!"}
{"text":"This is OK. Interesting burger combos but not cooked enough when asked for super well done. Liked it the first two times but not my fave. It's good for Fort Mill to have something new but not my fave."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the creative choices that they have here. We got the Blackcow burger, which has deep fried avocados on it, and the hangover burger, which has egg, bacon, cheese  and fries on it. The parmesan truffle fries were delicious.  I would specify how you would like your meat cooked, otherwise it is pretty well done."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a whim and loved it. We will definitely be coming back regularly. We split the earth burger, Gangnam burger, Brussels sprouts, and onion rings. The Brussels sprouts were out of this world and the earth burger was fresh and delicious. The service was great as well. I highly recommend Blacow Burger."}
{"text":"I have to echo others and question the change to table service. I can say that our visits had stopped because we just didn't want to mess with the extra time and expense of table service. Recently my son begged to go for lunch so we gave it a try. Our waiter was a nice young man, but still...why the change??  The interior is still set up for counter service, so it just feels odd (and I hate to say it, but maybe a bit desperate?) that it isn't. It was peak lunch time and there were only two other tables, so I'm wondering if others feel the same.   A big positive is that I will say the food seemed better than I remembered. I had a fried chicken sandwich that was really, really good. My son's hamburger was great.   Please bring back counter service - at least at lunch!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Fort Mill needed a burger spot and this is it!  Flaming cow and Cabellero burger were amazing. For the Cabellero we upgraded to a Wagu patty and it was worth it (extra thick, rich, and juicy). The standard short rib is good, if you don't want to pay the extra $2.  Onion rings were excellent, too. I have picky eaters and both kids devoured their kids burgers!  Customer service is excellent, food came out quickly... Very impressive especially since they just opened 2 days ago."}
{"text":"We tried out this place for the first time based on positive Yelp reviews but unfortunately did not have the same experience as the 4 and 5 star reviewers. We were there around 4:30 on a Sunday. We ordered The Hangover with mac & cheese and The Swiss Fun-Ghi with poutine. Simply put, we were completely underwhelmed and everything was mediocre at best. Nothing special about anything we tried. I think The Hangover could use one less layer so that it can be picked up and eaten without using a fork and knife. I started to order a draft beer but was told there was no alcohol sales on Sunday. I asked if that was a SC law or county law, and the waitress said no, it was due to \"lack of documentation.\" I'm not sure what that meant but just said ok and ordered water. Speaking of the waitress, she was a very sweet girl, but she was sweating profusely, to the point that sweat was pouring down her cheeks. Honestly, it turned my stomach and made me lose my appetite a bit because I kept thinking it was going to drip into my drink or food. And last but not least, the restaurant itself looked grimy and dirty. They weren't busy at all yet most of the tables weren't clean when we arrived (in fact, the waitress had to wipe down our table after we sat down), and the floors and windows were filthy. Also, I would suggest playing some music. To not be crowded, the restaurant was very loud due to several small children, and I think some background music would help drown out some of the noise. Based on this visit, I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"In terms of creativity this place gets a 6/5. Very creative concoctions and that means a lot to me. Probably the most creative in the area. And the only place I know of that sells a Wagyu burger.   The burgers (that I've had) have been good...which I just checked to see the name of one and it seems to be removed from their menu online. The blacow is also good.   So why a 3? Inconsistency. I feel like the business is having somewhat a crisis of identity with a fairly recent push to have servers vs ordering and having it delivered (not sure if this is so the customers now shoulder more of the responsibility of paying for the runners', now servers', paycheck?). It also feels weird to walk into a place not designed to have a \"wait to be seated\" section, and then wait. I saw a couple people walk in and want to order and stand there confused as to why they now needed to wait.   Speaking of, The wait has always been long, and now it's been longer the last two times I went and there's been servers taking orders since now I have to wait to be seated. Decide. Wait for the server to take my drink order. Get my drinks. Then food order. Then wait for it to come out. Then wait for the check, wait for them to run my card, and wait for my card to be returned. The old way of order, pay, food delivered, & eat was much better. Regardless of if I've been one of two tables or there's been a normal amount of people, the wait has always been long every time. Not a place you can come to if you're on a lunch break at work.   The price was a tad high before having servers (to a degree rightfully so), now it's even higher since you have to tip.   I want to end on a high note - the ambiance is great with industrial details and low lit mood lighting and the staff is always nice.   Overall, I'd still recommend it if you want a new burger or comfort food experience. Avoid it on kids night or during rush hours. I'd return a lot more frequently if they went back to self order, looked into the delays, and brought back the Frog (I think that was its name) burger."}
{"text":"Took MIL to Rock Hill to coupon- while she shopped we ate at this burger spot.  Everything was on point- the strawberry milkshake and the unique burger combinations. I don't recall the names because I wrote this review later, but my hubby's burger had jalepenos and ghost pepper sauce (it wasn't took much heat) and my burger had mushrooms/balsamic dressing and caramel used onions with arugula.  Like I said, not your ordinary burger toppings.  I hope to come back and visit soon!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Blacow for quite some time, and have always enjoyed the high quality burgers- the Waigu beef as well as the turkey burger. Really high quality meat served on a very good Brioche bun. The fries are crispy, both the standard and the sweet potato fries. I tried the Brussels sprouts, and they were excellent. Not inexpensive, but well worth what you pay for the quality. They have recently changed from ordering and paying at the counter to a full service restaurant. This is OK, but hopefully the service will be better once it catches on. I highly recommend Blacow for a good burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Love the Bang Bang Shrimp and burgers.   Service can be spotty but great food can make up for It.   Great choice if you love burgers."}
{"text":"They DO NOT have 50 cent wings on Wednesday anymore.  We stopped by at 8:40pm on Wednesday and the chairs were already flipped up on the tables like the place was closed. No one was in a hurry to greet or seat us and when we sat down the friendly server  offered us beverages.  We had planned on going and trying the wings solely for the great deal because Empire has incredible wings around the corner for the same regular price but we wanted to take advantage of the deal to test out these wings. The server informed us they stopped the wing deal about 2 weeks ago. We excused ourselves and ate elsewhere.  This place does have a yummy burger and I would recommend that and the fries. It is a little pricey when you add the drink and a side but the burger and sides were yummy in the past. I was really turned off by the chairs being flipped over with 20 minutes left until close. I'd probably go at lunch but will likely not plan to try again for dinner knowing how eager they are to close."}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious, haven't eaten there recently but when I went a while back it was delicious. Not a huge fan of their Mac n cheese or fries but burgers are good quality it seems!"}
{"text":"Food is good but wow is this place slow. 30 min for a burger and fries? Not sure if I caught them on a bad day or what. Call in orders, drive thru... 6 tables waiting on their food. Unacceptable in my opinion."}
{"text":"1st time here and the burgers are awesome and delicious! Definitely worth the trip and will be coming back to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed during this visit.  Why do they have table service with waitstaff now?!  It used to be so great as a fast-casual joint (order at counter, you seat yourself, they bring the food when it's ready).  If you're gonna be a table service restaurant then you need a host/hostess waiting at the front door, not standing in the back of the restaurant.  So we walk in and nobody is there.  There's a sign that reads \"Please wait to be seated\".  Do we wait at the front or walk to the counter in the back to order?  Well, we walked to the counter to order (like we always had in the past) and then when we said we would be dining in they sat us at a table and took our order there.  You can't be fast casual and table service, it's just awkward.  But, the burgers are still fantastic!  So that's worth 3 stars.  P.S.  bus your tables and sweep your floors throughout dinner service, it's gross  P.S.S.  stop closing off tables by flipping chairs up onto them while people are still in the restaurant, you're either open or closed, not both. And it was only 8:30 on a Friday."}
{"text":"Their Flaming Cow delivers a tasteful punch. I prefer mine with blue cheese to the menu suggested ghost pepper cheese. And from time to time they have a \"Nutty Goat\" special which is devine, I hear it will be added to their permanent menu (soon I hope)!    Also throughly enjoy the truffle fries on a cheat day and the brussel sprouts when watching the waistline :)"}
{"text":"It's nice to see a sign off the interstate for a non run of the mill restaurant. This place is reminiscent of Smashburger- but better! Glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"I've gone a few times but I haven't been wowed.  Every says it has the best burgers in Fort Mill, but to me they are average.  Is it that Fort Mill doesn't have a good burger place?  It's worth giving it a shot, but don't go in thinking you're going to have the best burger ever."}
{"text":"So I definitely enjoyed my meal at this spot. We had the Blacow burger and the burger special that day which was a Korean Pulled Pork Burger.   Both were delicious.  For side we had Garlic Parmesan Truffle Fries as well as Mac and Cheese.  Again, both were pretty darn good.  My hold negative about this spot is they don't seem to be able to handle burger temps well.  I asked for my burger medium and it definitely came out well done.  It was a wagyu beef burger and in my opinion it is a crime to cook that well done.  All in all it had fantastic flavor though.  The Tempura avocado on the Blacow burger brought a lot of flavor and great texture to that burger.  I really enjoyed the authentic flavor of the Korean pulled pork at well.  Cant wait to get back there and try some other menu items.  The chicken wings sound great and so does the poutine.   I didn't make it to a shake, but they looked tasty.  The staff was super friendly and super helpful with explanations of the menu.  Great spot to check out with family or with friends."}
{"text":"Driving through the area from the Columbia area of South Carolina and stopped in because of Yelp reviews. I got the chili cheeseburger with brussel sprouts and my husband got the Swiss Fun-Ghi. Y'all, this may be one of the best burgers I've ever had - juicy and flavorful. And the sprouts were to die for. We'll be making the 1 hour, 20 minute drive when we want a delicious burger."}
{"text":"Just had burgers tonight! First time there.had Caballero berger! Delicious,very big berger. Had the parmasean garlic fries. Also delicious.  Also had onion rings.  Also tried the chocolate shake. A little too chocolaty.  Over all i would recommend this restaurant.  It is pricey  though. Very good servers."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers with lots of options, friendly staff, love the fries and brussel sprouts. Good beer selection. Casual and family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Consistently good food Love the Poutine. As good as the poutine from Toronto.  All burger are cooked to order and done very nicely.  And milkshakes are legit"}
{"text":"Hamburgers were very good,loved the fries BUT. They need to clean occasionally.  The windows were extremely dirty, the base of the tables were covered in dust, the ketchup bottle was sticky, the napkin holders were not clean even the salt shaker top was covered in dust   I watched a waitress wipe off a table and she wiped it onto the floor.  There were fries that she just wiped onto the floor!  I am sitting there eating a great burger wondering if they don't keep what I can see clean what does the kitchen look like.  I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to go back the next day! Definitely the best burgers in the area. I had the hangover burger and it was worthy of its name. Layered with gravy fries and cheese curds. It was so good. The truffle fries are a must. They have really good steamed buns too! Did I mention they have beer on tap? A++"}
{"text":"I had not visited  before the new table service, yet clearly saw that they need to revert to the old system.  Pretty dead and still had to wait to be seated. Should have been our first clue. Weird service and did not receive a refill. My burger had lots of ingredients and still lacked much flavor. Again, weird. For the prices, lackluster flavor ( plus the fries were bland)and queasy  aftertaste,we will not return."}
{"text":"This was awesome! I love the Asian style Blacow burger with fried avocado, teriyaki sauce, and carmelized onions. The poutine fries (gravy and cheese curds) were also to die for! This is my new favorite burger place."}
{"text":"We really liked Blacow Burger the first couple of times we went there, but ever since they changed to a server based style rather than ordering at the counter, it's gone downhill.  Last 2 times have been slow, tough to get a refill, so we did that on our own, and the fries have been cold.  Kind of just not ok lately."}
{"text":"If I spend $45.00 for 3 burgers I expect more than a 4oz charcoal briquette. I was so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow - great burger and ambience. Might be the best burger in the Charlotte metro area!"}
{"text":"Big Willie and truffle fries were amazing! Wish there was one closer to where we live! My son says he would eat here everyday!!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to preface the 3 stars with, this place probably makes the BEST burgers in Fort Mill. I'm a big fan of getting my burgers medium-rare and trust few places to get it right. Tonight we had the Caballero and the Gangnam, specialty burgers with a more SoCal and Korean flavors that I'd rate 4.5. Mac and Cheese has perfectly balanced pepper with the cheese. Fries are consistent, crunchy and fresh.  Understanding that this is a small business, sometimes it's difficult to monitor order accuracy and keeping pricing consistent. In this case it was the Poutine which didn't have the gravy, and the younger staff probably didn't understand that I was testing the service by calling and telling them of the issue to see their response outside of an apology, which we at least got the apology.  Also pricing between the website and the menu for the two burgers were a $1 difference between online and the in store menu, easily reconciled by updating the website to $10 per burger.  That being said, if none of these things bother you, I'd recommend hitting this place up if you've never been there. Food came out in the 15 minutes promised and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to many places that have good burgers but none as great as Blacow. They make everything from scratch including their rolls. Love the Hangover burger and they have the best sweet potatoes fries on the planet.   Highly recommend upgrading to the Wagyu beef. It melts in your mouth.   They serve a variety of bottled beer. My only wish item is for better wine choices.   My husband and I plan to bring all our out-of-town guests to visit and have recommended this place to our neighbors who now love it too.   Great for either lunch or dinner. Service has been very friendly and it is kept clean.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. I had the Swiss Fun-Ghi and it was cooked perfect! We ordered take out and my husband had to drive back to the restaurant to get the lemonade that came with the kids meal. When we got home, we realized it was a cup of water and not lemonade...disappointing. Other than that, great food, will eat here again."}
{"text":"We went at 2pm on a friday and service was fast and food delicious. There is alot of seating for the hole in the wall appearance. i had the F R O G  burger.. and the crispy balsamic brussel sprouts as my side. Delicious!! The bang bang shrimp was tasty too. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries. The fries are house made and are skinny cut and delicious. I had the burger that had guacamole, bacon and onion straws on it. It was fantastic. The Asian inspired options sounded interesting and their beers were all craft beers. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers - be sure to order cooked how you want and they've never disappointed! Some incredibly innovative and unique flavors and the BEST BRUSSEL SPROUTS I've ever tasted.    Blacow recently added sides to each burger order - really a much greater value."}
{"text":"Amazing burger! The last place I had a burger like this was in Vegas. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Very good burger spot.  Friendly service and spot on food.  Wasn't anything amazing, but easily a place I would go again.  the Gluten Free bun is what let me down.  Pure Knead is the best bun for burgers followed by canyon bakehouse, but this tasted like a dry Udis bun, which are by far the worst GF buns, but at least they had one available!"}
{"text":"We pass by this place every time we go to Nothing Bundt Cakes but never checked it out. Last night we finally did it.  The waitress came right away with the menu and explained everything to us, including the special of the day and that every Wednesday they have wings 50 cent a piece. My husband and I both decided to go with the special of the day. A hamburger with triple bacon, candied, jalapeño and apple smoked, I have Parmesan truffle fries and my husband the onion rings as side.  They menu is very interesting with good options and they price is regular.  I fell in love with my French fries and the onion rings were pretty good too. We didn't like the ranch dressing, however they had a dressing of their own that was good! I enjoyed my burger very much, it wasn't the best I've ever had but was good and most importantly, cooked the way I ordered it - medium rare. I really enjoyed the service and how fast the food was done.  I can't wait to go back and try their wings!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome burgers. We found this little gem while visiting the area. The lady at the cashier was extremely helpful with all the questions we asked. We wanted to order everything in the menu.  The combinations are quite interesting but you can also make your own, which I did.  Burgers took about 10-15 min to be brought to our table but worth the wait. They were delicious and we wanted to go for more."}
{"text":"We visited recently and while the food was great, they now have table service which was not so great. We waited a few minutes to be seated because no one acknowledged us. After we were seated, we saw one party walk away from the door because no one acknowledged them. If you're going to have table service, you need to have a host/hostess, especially considering all of the other staff is at the opposite end of the restaurant. Service was also very slow even though they weren't busy. They need to go back to counter-service, which seems to be the norm for most burger joints now anyway."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? It's been awhile since my husband and I been here so we decided to stop at Blacow for an early dinner. Usually you just walk up to the front, place your order and find a seat...fast food style. They have changed their service where it is now dine in...restauramt style where they seat you and take your order. All I could say is that I am very disappointed. Poor customer service. After we got seated another couple walked in and was seated. They waited about 5-10 minutes to have someone to take their order. 5-10 minutes may seem short but they were not busy at all. The waiter who seated them didnt even bother coming back to take their order. Another girl came and  took their drink order...took another 10 minutes for them to get their drink so they got up and left. We finally got our food and my husband had ordered chilli cheese fries. Of course they didnt provide him with a fork or anything so he ended up eating the chilli cheese fries with his hands. Im disappointed and sad to see what have become of this place. They need to change back. The food is great but we will no longer be coming back to Blacow."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. I had the big willy....the candied pork belly was delicious. Kind of a hip looking place inside. Didn't expect it in a strip mall. By far my new favorite place to eat a burger now."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place definitely earned the Best of Charlotte award!! Blacow Burger was lights out and their homemade onion rings and fries are legit! Must come!"}
{"text":"Really good omg. Idk if I was super hungry if the food was actually that bomb but it really got me going. The prices are a little high - kinda like umami burger but it's worth it. They have truffle fries too! Our $17 meal consisted of the blacow burger, parmasean truffle fries, and a soda. It filled both of us up and we still have a little bite of the burger and some fries leftover. You order ur food and they bring it to your table -  like mcallisters. I'm very satisfied with our food. I would definitely recommend! I personally loved the fried tofu on our burger but my boyfriend said he would've like fresh avocado instead. The burger has a nice teriyaki type sauce that compliments the avocado well.   I recommend eating your truffle fries with ketchup as it really enhances the ketchup for me and made it taste like umami burgers house made ketchup."}
{"text":"service is slow like a tortoise crossing the street (a tortoise is probably faster). The food is over rated. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic new burger restaurant with excellent burgers and gourmet fries! Wagyu beef Blacow burger with truffle fries garnished in cilantro was wonderful as was the salted caramel and coffee shake. Only been open a month but they are fantastic! They also have poutine fries where they air ship the real cheeses used for them. Awesome and authentic!  Went back here last month and the food is just as good as it was when I reviewed it earlier.   The poutine is wonderful."}
{"text":"Bold vision executed pretty well, actually.  We were on the way from Charlotte to Charleston and needed a quick place to go for lunch. Burgers are generally pretty safe, so I opted to stop at Blacow while I kept an eye on the weather.  I got the slightly-unfortunately-named F.R.O.G. burger, but it makes more sense when you learn it has a fig, raspberry, orange, and ginger reduction. This reduction also holds together the arugula, bacon and a very thick slice of basil goat cheese.  The verdict? Not bad. The fries were awesome. The burger was cooked medium-well, when I prefer medium (and I wasn't asked how I liked my burger, either), a mistake that seems to compound when using short ribs as meat, as the meat part of it was drier than it should have been. The taste was unaffected, fortunately.  As for the other components, they tasted good individually but overall it didn't quite get to \"top burger\" status. It's probably more of a quibble than anything else, as overall I'd still rate it a very good burger. After all, that reduction was delicious.  Worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Was interested in this place because they offer different types of meat and buns, and I thought that was really cool. They have a hangover burger which is absurdly huge. I walked in, was immediately greeted by a very nice waitress (I shoulda got her name, apologies). I told her it was my first time, and was tryna see what they were all about. She was very knowledgeable in the menu and was very kind and attentive to me, big plus. I had the \"caballero\" burger, and French fries. The fries were delicious, but the burger was so-so :/. I expected more flavor from what I got, but it wasn't really there. Just tasted like a regular burger no big deal, so perhaps next time I'll go with something a bit different I guess. Restaurant was clean, and dishes, cups, cutlery were as well.   Only downside in my opinion:  *flavor. Again it could just be my choice of burger.  *they played Michael Jackson music in the kitchen, instead of the actual restaurant. And I like MJs music, so please play it on the sound system. Eh, that's more of a plus I guess lol."}
{"text":"1st the Good: The truffle fries are awesome.             The staff was friendly.  The Bad: pretty much everything else. We ordered 2 burgers. The 1st one came out, was wrong, got corrected and was half eaten all before the 2nd burger made it to the table. We were the only customers. My burger, the Blacow, which was the 2nd one, was super well done. It was so well done that the char on the outside was nothing but completely burnt meat. The other burger was cook medium well but she said it had almost no flavor.  Overall way too pricey for burnt, flavorless burgers.   1st and last vist."}
{"text":"Best burger they have non gmo and serves IPA  Must try a good non chain gig . Have great shakes and wonderful customer service easily accessible from highway ."}
{"text":"This review for the AMAZING customer service that I received yesterday. I placed an online order for around 7 meals that I was dropping off to a group.  I was SO impressed with the customer service experience we had with Braxton. Once he realized that we were separating the meals to different people, he took the initiative to bag the meals individually, labeled each one, and added napkins, condiments, and silverware to each. I was really blown away because this made the lunch drop off 100x easier.  I didn't personally try the food but everyone raved about how great it is :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be so much better before they decided to implement waitstaff. Before, you ordered at the counter and then went to get your own drink and find your own seat. Once the food was ready they would deliver it to your table. It was great.   Now, you have to wait to be seated, I don't know why. Once you are seated you are often served by some kid who has no idea how to wait a table. Half the time I have to go refill my own glass. In the end I am expected to tip this person for the poor service that I never even wanted. It is so frustrating that I may stop going here even though I LOVE the Flaming Cow burger. PLEASE GO BACK TO SELF SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite burger joint! I love the Asian inspired options also. The kimchi fries are amazing and they're not scared to top it with extra kimchi! I've had the Blacow (waygu), Caballero, Fungi & swiss, and Gangnam (kimchi burger). All were great. Awesome onion rings too!"}
{"text":"I don't always give 5 gold stars but I think this place might deserve it. Nice clean location. Everyone seems really nice and happy to work there. They are still new so I am cutting them some slack. I am sure they are working out the details. I have the Blacow Teriyaki Burger and it was really awesome. I lived in Japan. I love Japanese flavors, or Unami, and this hit it out of the park. Made me feel like for a split second I was in Tokyo at my favorite Teriyaki place. They even have Wagyu beef. Well played...well played indeed."}
{"text":"I had the Flaming and my friend had the Blacow (Waygu).  All in all i think it was a good burger with a good bun to meat ratio.  Bun was soft and meat was juicy with decent flavor.  But to be fair theres not much you really can do to a burger that can change the game.  Reason why i gave it 3 star is because I do think its a bit pricey to pay $13/&17 (Me: Burger, truffle fries, and water Friend: Waygu, reg fries, tea) for lunch.  They should at least have lunch specials to keep cost down.  Staff was friendly with good service.  I would go back if i'm craving for a burger.  Good Luck!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this on a Friday evening when every other place around had hour long wait times. Amazing burgers!! Meat is high quality and tons of flavor. Fries were very good and my daughters wings were equally as good! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We waited for over an hour on a week night to receive our food. When the food arrived it was only lukewarm and was cold within minutes. The burger did have great flavor, but again it was practically cold. Three different waiters came to get our drink order. It is to my understanding that the table service is a new concept here, and I would really recommend to this business to go back to ordering at the counter. The manager was walking around seemingly oblivious to the fact that anything was wrong, but it was clear that all the tables around us were unhappy as well. We were very excited to try Blacow but hate to say we won't be back unless there are some major changes."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Blackow burger. The price/ quality balance is great, and the food was good. I got the flaming cow, which lived up to its name. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Burger was so good. I got the Swiss fun-ghi burger with poutine as my side. Both were so good. I have never had poutine before and I really am disappointed that I have missed out on such deliciousness for so long. I have also read reviews about the macaroni and cheese so I can't wait to go back so I can try that!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here after church for lunch. I was treated as though I was stupid because I didn't understand that a Pork Belly Bun was an entire sandwich, not a type of bun they were offering.  Our food comes, and this \"bacon\" (I was spefically told it was bacon) is nothing more than 2 one inch strips of pure baked fat with a tiny piece of meat on one side.  A random, very sweet waitress asked if our food was good and I told her mine was not.  She came back to our table and said the man who was so rude was going to come apologize.  He didn't bother to come.  It was our first and last trip.  I will not recommend it to anyone that should ask me about it either."}
{"text":"What an awesome find!  After a college visit with my son, we stumbled upon this gem off of one of the exits on the way back to Charlotte.  An interesting menu that definitely peaks curiosity with items like the Gangnam Burger, southern chicken club, bacon ranch cheese fries.... balsamic glazed brussel sprouts.... yup.... I'm right at home!  I opted for the Gangnam burger with grilled  chicken instead of the short rib burger. And it was definitely good!  Juicy with a great umami flavor that I think of when eating most Asian themed food.  My son had a cheese burger which he also enjoyed. Instead of fries I opted for the brussel sprouts and was so glad I did!  Delicious!  These are not you grandma's Brussels.... these were fried beyond .... well they were still recognizable.... but amazingly good with a tangy sweet balsamic reduction.  I did steal one(or five) of my son's fries which were perfectly done.   The food was awesome  The service was great too!  I would not have tried the Gangnam with chicken if it weren't for the friendly young lady who took our order and recommended it.  I think it's really cool that they have a drive-thru too although the inside of the restaurant is great to dine.  The outside is unassuming but thin inside is nice with giant TV'a if you are interested in watching a game or something  Needless to say I would totally come back with the rest of the fam and friends whether visiting my son or in need of a tasty creative burger!"}
{"text":"We ordered The Classic with Hand Cut fries and The Gobble with Sweet Potato fries. The counter staff seemed eager to help, but when questioned seemed poorly trained, if at all. We received the fries about 10 minutes before our burgers came out which was annoying, but seemed common amongst the other customers. When we tried to get Ketchup, they were out of Heinz in the pump and gave us some fancy ketchup packets. Being originally from south of Pittsburgh, this was a terrible substitute. The Hand Cut fries however were fried well and tasted fresh. The Sweet Potato fries needed salt.   After finally receiving the burgers with now cold fries in hand, the Gobble patty was pre packaged, not fresh ground turkey and didn't have sprouts because they were out.  They have been open for a week and are out of sprouts and Ketchup. Get with the program. The Classic had too much bread to meat ratio, the sauce had a strong vinegar taste and the bottom bun was stale.   Analysis: Two trips in one. 1st and last.  Spend your money at American Burger Co. they have it figured out better there."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today the burger and fries were excellent .the service was A1 only negative I can say is put salt and pepper shakers in the table.will be back again."}
{"text":"Just tried this place today and it was great! The burgers came out so quickly. The food is great!!! My burger was cooked perfectly and the Mac and cheese was awesome!"}
{"text":"Been twice, delicious both times. Their mac n cheese side taste home made very good."}
{"text":"I won't be back because the price was too high. I got the Caballero and it was good, but, not worth the price. It does not come with a side. I paid for my fountain drink. My daughters got a kids gluten free cheeseburger (on a gf bun for $1.50 xtra) and a kids chicken tenders. My bill came to $27.80. I didn't even get fries and it's not a sit-down restaurant. That's just too much money for what it is."}
{"text":"Service is HORRIBLE. I placed and paid for my order online. I arrived 10 minutes after the email said it would be ready and I am sitting here 20 minutes after the time it was supposed to be ready still waiting. There is no one at the counter ordering. Employees are talking with one another. No one is even looking my way. Not the way to do business."}
{"text":"This place is a bit on the expensive side but the variety and specialty burgers and sides are worth it when added to the great service we received. Our waitress was named Paris and she was very knowledgeable of the menu and every time we visit encouraged us to try new things on the menu, that do not disappoint. The fried brussel sprouts are amazing. The \"earth burger\" veggie burger is mediocre the veggie-head never complains when we eat at this upscale burger joint because of the truffle fries."}
{"text":"Blackcow consistently delivers a great quality burger....very good combinations, cooked well, sides are always very good also...nice place, always very clean. Definitely our go to burger joint."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger spots, hands down.  It's always clean and the food is consistently amazing. The truffle fries are really good but the onion rings are the star for me (sides-wise).  This place was super accommodating to my wife who also has gluten intolerances which ups the stars for me."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers and fries. The burgers are made with top grade meat, are juicy with great flavor. This is a local place and not a chain. Great people and service!"}
{"text":"Tried Blacow last night for something different - nice surprise!  Burgers were great + the mac cheese and Brussels were AMAZING!!! Very nice staff. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great. Service not so much. A kid came over or us and showed us the beer list and didn't come back \"at all\" so we got a different girl to wait on us.  The burgers were great but the servers not being being knowledgeable and being real \"quick and go\" make me want to have a beer and burger else where .. and \"yes\" i have waited tables and bar tended for many years ."}
{"text":"Awesome Gangnam burger & Flaming Cow burger!! Lots of different side choices. Excellent customer service & friendly staff. Monday & Tuesday they have fantastic beer specials & 50¢ wings on Wednesday! Definitely doesn't hurt that I live 1 miles away and my apartment complex has a partnership with them where we get 20% off all food!"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are excellent. The first time we ordered over the phone, the second time we dined in. The service was terrible!! We got our drinks, ordered our food, the food came out and we didn't see our waiter until he handed us the check AND then he ask if we needed refills. I'll be ordering take out from now on!"}
{"text":"This place was soooo good! The burger selection was diverse with tons to choose from and the pricing wasn't too bad, pretty average price for a good burger.   The only thing that I was disappointed in was that I asked for my side order to be mac n cheese and ended up with fries. Honestly I didn't notice until I ate half the fries, but they were still good anyways.   Can't wait to come back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. I ordered the Cabellero burger with onion rings and couldn't eat it fast enough. The seasoning and attention to detail were off the chain. My son finished all his chicken tenders too, which has never happened. They got something for everyone.  Atmosphere and cleanliness were 5 star as well. Nice to have a place like this in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"Talk about your pleasant surprises. My Wife and I stopped here to check the place out. It has a nice casual vibe to it and we were greeted by our server Chloe. The menu is a burger lovers dream. You have every type of burger here. Meat, Chicken,Turkey and Black Bean. Today we split The Caballero with a Wagyu patty, which was loaded with flavor as well as an order of Garlic Parmesan Wings and they were some of the best I've ever had. With so many varieties of items, it's safe to say we will be back. Chloe was charming and a good."}
{"text":"Go here for burgers.  I've been twice, both times for lunch.  Best in Charlotte?  If it isn't the best it's right up there.  Conveniently located off the interstate and worth the drive from wherever you are.  Blacow is quality.  I had the \"classic\" and the Cabellero both times with onion rings.  The burgers are plentiful and hand formed from fresh meat, not frozen and you can tell.  The onion rings, not sure how they do them but OMG they're wonderful.  Blacow must have a \"sauce guy\" or had someone that knew what the hell they're doing when they came up with the sauces because all of their sauces are delicious and perfectly compliment the dishes.  The onion ring sauce doubles down on the sheer awesomeness of the rings.  If you read my reviews, you know my daughter is very sensitive celiac and must eat gluten free.  Blacow takes care of her.  The beef is gluten free, and the fries are done in a separate fryer as to not contaminate.  They offer gluten free buns and she felt great after eating there.  I also have to give kudos to the waitstaff.  Braxton who was my server both times was educated and made me and my daughter comfortable about eating there.  That's huge.  His service was great also as a whole.  Other in my party have ordered off the Kids Menu (Chicken tenders) and Sweetie had the Shrimp Tacos.  She's pescatarian and they had a few options for her.  The shrimp tacos had nice size shrimp that we of good quality, you can tell.  Braxton recommended the wings and I did see them come out of the kitchen and they looked great, so I'll check them out next time.  Blacow is great and you should definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"This place is in a good location, halfway between downtown Fort Mill and Tega Cay.  Although it is located in a small strip mall, the interior is really pretty and every chair is padded (unlike some of the area's newer burger spots).    You order at the counter, but food is delivered to your table.  I ordered The Nutty Goat, the weekly special, which was a burger with garlic herb goat cheese, pecans, pickles, pickled onions, and chipotle aioli.  I asked for it without pickle but it came with.  I ended up removing the pickled onions - they were tasty, but there were a lot of them and since they were cold, I felt like they were detracting from the burger.    The burger was DELICIOUS; one of the better burgers I've had, and the best in Fort Mill by a considerable margin.  I ordered onion straws as my side and they were equally good - perfectly crisp with a subtle spice to the breading.  The salted caramel milkshake did not taste like either salt or caramel to me but I have no complaints, because it was really good - perfectly thick and creamy with excellent flavor.  Quibbles:  the price - my meal, which included a bottle of water, was close to $20.00 with tax, which is kind of a lot for a Saturday burger lunch - and the pacing.  My bottle of water was delivered 4 minutes after I ordered; within 15 minutes of the order I had my food.  My shake, however, did not appear until almost 25 minutes after the order, and only after I had returned to the counter to ask about it (I had forgotten initially that I'd ordered it; the person dropping off my food did not mention it at all.)  Regarding pricing:  I saw some reference in reviews to a $7 burger. All burgers today were between $9-$12; the weekly special was $11.00.  All sides are listed as \"Starters\" on the menu at $4 in price; the menu indicates burgers come with hand-cut fries.  I asked if I could have something else, and was told I could select from any of their sides.  Two thumbs up on those onion straws:  MUCH better than the other local joint.  Oh, and the bottle of water was $1.50 - I was happily surprised with that price."}
{"text":"What a find! We loved the  taste combinations they have. Worth trying if in the area."}
{"text":"The burgers are great and have a very unique offering of Korean flavors. It used to be an order-at-the-counter place and all was good. Now they have switched to having waiters. That's Fine and all, but that really means about a 15% price increase and the decor and layout do not suite a server type restaurant."}
{"text":"IDENTITY CRISIS???? So let me be clear. The burger was ok on its way to being good.  The service was what it is at a place like this. Young man politely took order and later brought to my table.  So where is the reason I gave them three stars??? I thought maybe it should of been 2 star.   So I am not one to typically order a $9-12 dollar burger for lunch, but I did today.  Here is my beef with this place and why I honestly do not think they will be in business long.  We agree it's a pricey lunch burger. With that burger come a few good things such as unusual toppings, but what is important is what you don't get. 1. I ordered burger fries and water.  For 14$ I get a cup for water that is the size of a specimen cup.  If I'm paying 14$ for a burger, I'm not here to rip off 5 extra ounces of Diet Coke. 2.  If you want salt/pepper, get ready to go get a hand full of those packs that have a miniscule amount of product in them. 3. Napkins- what can I say? They are the kind that if you touch them, they disintegrate.  Cheap cheap 4. Condiments-  if you want them you have to go to front station and fill those miserable little soufflé cups. So the lesson is thus. I think if you pay twice the going rate or more for a burger, some things like a ketchup bottle, salt and pepper shaker and a napkin that stays together are warranted.  If you are cutting corners that drastically on the front of the store, i shutter to think how and witg what you are cutting in the back of the store.  Good luck, I feel you will need it."}
{"text":"Great black bean burger! I love that both sides of the bun is grilled! Turkey burger was also great! Fries stay warm because they are in a stainless steel container and the place is very clean. Still waiting on liquor license for beer and wine."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister as she's eaten here before and I must say, the food and service were great!  It's located within a strip of other businesses, but you can find it on the end.  We ate in and were seated pretty quickly- they brought over a liter glass bottle of water for the table.  They have burgers, hot dogs, salads and great sides (their crispy brussel sprouts are to die for).  My sister had a burger and I had the hot dogs (the entree comes with two hot dogs and a side) and they were super delicious.  Did I mention how inexpensive it was?  It was definitely worth trying and I can't wait to bring my hubby here!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cabellero burger, mac and cheese and a drink. $13.08. Soft drinks for diabetics are limited to Diet Pepsi, water or unsweet tea and saccharin from the 70's. No Equal or Splenda. Burger was good but not great. Mac and cheese was dry and bland. Salt and pepper only available in packets. This is an obvious for max profit business. Prices and menu are chef quality but all else is at a minimum budget. Menu doesn't match fast food quality condiments and accessories. I don't know when it became acceptable to pay restaurant prices and have everything else at minimum effort and budget. You order at the register and food is brought to you tag table same as Hardee's but at twice the price"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch with family.  I had the Gangnam Burger.  Burger was seasoned with bulgogi and topped with kimchi. It was delicious.  Family all enjoyed their  lunches.  Blacow did an outstanding job renovating after previous restaurant closed. I did not realize how large of a restaurant it was; and is very well decorated."}
{"text":"I loved this place! You have to go to the counter to order, but the quality of the food was so worth it! The Waygu (Japanese Black Cow Beef) is very tasty and the variety of burgers makes this an adventure. They even have one called 'Gangnam' which includes Kimchi.  I had the Swiss Fun-Ghi on a gluten free bun, which contained Waygu, Sautéed Mushrooms, Baby Arugula, Carmelized Onion, Swiss Cheese & Truffle Mayo. I loved it!  They have all kinds of Salad, which you can get topped with one of their Burgers. Also really sweet people waiting on us."}
{"text":"Went back to Blacow tonight for the last time. A 41-minute wait for a hamburger is beyond ridiculous.  Decent quality at a premium price with crap service. Nope.   I gave them a other try and got burned again. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"So we finally tried Blacow Burger tonight! (We got Togo-ordered on line & picked up) It was great!! I had the Wedge salad & classic Cheese Burger. My husband had the Chili Cheese Burger and cheese curd gravy fries.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Of the many new burger joints in the area this is one of my favorites.  We went for lunch over the weekend and left stuffed and happy.  There was a bit of confusion at the register when we ordered but once everything was settled we got our plasticware and took a seat. Our original table was wobbly so we decided to move. My chocolate shake came out first and it was delicious. Our food followed which was two hangover burgers one truffle oil fries and one poutine fries. We may have been in pain from the drinks the night before and over ordered in hopes of alleviating the consequences of those choices. The hamburgers may not have had large patties but with everything they put in the hangover burger it sure was huge! Each fry side we got was more than enough for two people. My truffle fries were amazing they tasted as if they had been hanging out in a truffle oil pool just moments before coming it me. But in a good way I promise! My boyfriend's vanilla shake came out when we were about half way done with our food.   There were a few kinks that were expected as a new place but our meal was delicious. I will have to return to try another one of their burgers. While I enjoyed my hamburger there were so many items other than hamburger I can't quite attest to the quality of their meat."}
{"text":"The 3 stars is strictly for the food. I was really looking forward to well crafted burger with great flavor and awesome side dishes. Unfortunately, I didn't find that here.   Decor-great location, right off highway and in lovely Fort Mill. Dining room is quite large with many tables and booths. Don't remember a specific theme on walls that I could think of. Nothing special, but nothing terrible either.   Service-only 1 girl working that I saw. She was very nice and greeted me with a smile, which surprisingly doesn't happen everywhere. She was also the person serving food to tables. Over all, she was very pleasant  Food-let's start off with burger. It was presented well and looked very good, but that was not the case. It lacked flavor and meat had pieces of fat or something that I could've chew. Fries were bland and Mac n Cheese was just ok.   Tip-it was almost completely empty, only 1 person in entire place. Guess, that should've told me something."}
{"text":"First visit. Totally just a drive by decision to try because we turned that direction coming off the interstate. Great place to eat and now on my exit list in Fort Mill SC!  Huge party ordered before us, but didn't seem to slow up the service at all. Had the regular burger. Daughter had the turkey burger. Excellent taste for both. Bun was delicious and soft. Burger was good just right. Upgraded to chili cheese fries. Great decision!"}
{"text":"I tried a plain burger and also the Gangnam Korean burger. The Korean kimchi was a nice touch, but they were both very greasy. Even had grease on top of the bun. The plain burger actually tasted a little like a McDonalds burger. I felt bloated the rest of the day too. I just don't understand why burgers like these cost $10 or more.  Just down the street there's a place called Burger Craft that serves lean grass-fed burgers for slightly less price, and without the stomach ache. I'll be going there for my burgers going forward."}
{"text":"Best burger place in the Fort Mill/Taga Cay area!  Blacow takes a unique spin on traditional burgers with a gourmet menu complimented by one of the best milk shakes i've ever had.  Their fresh cut fries are delicious, and you can't find a tender and juicy pork belly sandwich/bun anywhere close to their flavor and quality.  I'll be dining here again soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is new so I might try it again in a few months. We got a to go order from here without any issues. This restaurant is located right off of 160.   I got the flaming cow burger. It came with the patty, ghost pepper cheese, jalapeno chips and sriracha mayo. It also came with lettuce and tomato. I asked to add onions to it but did not receive it. The burger was ok, a little overcooked. It was also a little under seasoned. The cheese was good and spicy. Not crazy spicy but it definitely had a kick to it. I didn't care for the jalapeno chips. It was very bready (is that even a word?). I also got the onion rings, they were pretty good.   My coworker got the funghi burger and she said there were only 3 mushrooms on it. She said it was just ok. My other coworker got the chicken cali burger-it came with the grilled chicken, avocado and chipotle ranch and bacon. She said the chicken was a little dry. They also got fries with their order and thought they were average. One asked for a side of chipotle ranch and was told that they didn't have chipotle ranch which was strange since it came with the cali burger. Someone got the onion straws and thought they were good and spicy.   Overall, this place has potential. It's worth a try. It is al la carte though!"}
{"text":"First time trying the place. Overall good experience. Gourmet burgers, fries, and milkshakes. The fries were really overpriced and the burgers were borderline too pricy but good food and atmosphere. They have a pretty cool sink in the ladies bathroom too."}
{"text":"I had the Hawaiian hamburger and mac and cheese. First, the hamburger was perfect. A little messy, but that is the way a Hawaiian burger usually is. Great sauce. The mac and cheese? THE best $3 mac and cheese ever. A big bowl, and did I say, $3? It is set up like a fast casual restaurant, but they actually had a wait to be seated sign and seat you and a waiter comes to your table. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried Blacow for the first time and took the employees recommendation and had the Blacow burger with Wagyu beef patty and hand cut French fries. Perfect!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu too. There is an interesting turkey burger too."}
{"text":"Many people have commented on the great burgers and I agree. They are fresh and flavorful with interesting toppings. Cooked just right, neither greasy nor dry. Try the parmesan garlic fries on the side. Nice beer selection for a burger place. But I especially want to commend the service. The guy at the counter explained the menu and helped us narrow down our choices. The food was brought out to the table very promptly. Everyone was quite courteous. The dining area is spacious and there are various sizes of booths and tables to accommodate different size groups.  Multiple TV 's throughout but the volume is kept low so it's not a sports bar atmosphere. Great experience and will be back."}
{"text":"The menu and prices makes you think you are about experience something new and wonderful. Its just a good hamburger at an elevated price."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to the Fort Mill area! Burgers were excellent, definitely the best in the area!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. My husband's soda had black specks floating in it, and when he pointed it out to the server, he asked \"What would you like me to do?\" Husband ordered the Blacow burger and Brussels sprouts. They were fine, but his burger was a little rare. I ordered the Cobb salad- it was disgusting. Tons of lettuce and very little else, the sliced eggs were gray, and the ranch tasted funny. Our little boy ordered macaroni and cheese which tasted rancid- he wouldn't eat it at all, and I didn't blame him after tasting it myself. Got him a Slim Jim when we got back on the road- not a parenting win, but he was hungry. Very disappointed in a place that looked really cute."}
{"text":"After visiting some friends for the weekend we stopped by here on the way to the airport and this was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had anywhere in the country.  The bun was freshly made and nice and warm.  The patty was amazing....melted in your mouth.  My wife who barely eats meat and doesn't like burgers even loved it and commented that that's one burger she could eat regularly.  Too bad theres nothing like this here in Seattle.  We'll be back some day to try others."}
{"text":"I love eating here and the burgers are fabulous!! They are always willing to accommodate my weird order. The fries are really good when they are hot. I also like that I can call in my order and pick it up at the window. Definitely will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I tried this place sooner?  It's in a small strip center and had assumed this was an order at the counter, sit and wait kinda place.  Instead we were greeted by hostess who sat us in a booth and took our order.    Obviously a place known for it's burgers, based on the name, but the couple of sides we tried were phenomenal.  I wasn't hungry enough for a burger, so I ordered the Nathan's hot dog plate, 2 chili dogs and 1 side for $9.  The dogs were pretty good, but the brussel sprouts were really good.  Charred and served with a reduced balsamic.  My daughter ordered a bowl of loaded potato soup and a side of mac n cheese.  The soup could have been a little thicker, but the mac n cheese was ridiculous!   Looking forward to coming back with more of an appetite for a burger."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Full disclosure - I love fusion-concept restaurants and this place fit that bill. They do have your standard burgers so it's a win-win for everyone. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to eat a better quality meat patty or enjoys Asian fusion. If you are upset about the price, well, there is a Burger King nearby. In life, you have to pay extra for quality."}
{"text":"This is truly a gourmet burger with an Asian twist. This place was recommended by our friends so we decided to give it a try. We were well pleased to say the least! The service was great and the staff was friendly. You order up front and take a number, once the food is ready they serve it to you at your table. They even clear your table after. We wanted to try a little bit of everything so they were kind enough to cut our burgers in half so we could all share between the two couples. My favorite burger is the blacow it was well seasoned. Moist with a touch of sweetness but not too much where it was overpowering. The poutine fries was to die for! It's a huge portion that could be shared by the whole table.  Parmesan fries and onion rings where good as well. I loved the fact that the fries stayed crispy even though there was a gravy like sauce drizzled on top. The hangover had everything but the kitchen sink on it! It was my next favorite burger. To me it was a perfect combination of ingredients therefore it didn't even need ketchup or anything else added. The best part is that the burgers are made to order just the way you like it. We like ours medium rare, most places won't cook it that way and if they do they always screw it up but here ours burgers came out perfectly. They use high quality beef and ingredients and apparently the buns are made from scratch! That's why you can definitely tell the deference between a gourmet burger versus a McDonalds or five guys burger, they just don't even compare to here! It may be pricey than other burgers because it's not your regular burger.... Its well worth the price for the type and quality you get. Wish we had one where I live because I would definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I would consider this one of the best hidden gems in the area.  I love food and burgers for that matter ... but wagyu as a burger... pessimistic at first but now believe it's a phenomenal concept.  I am a restaurant person working in the industry as well for over 20 years ... great food!!! Keep it up! Sorry for the bad comments from people who do not understand good food takes time and effort and great food is not suppose to be cheap! I think you are right on on the price point!! BRAVO!!"}
{"text":"Damn we wanted to like this place, Fort Mill needs more restaurants so badly.  The burgers were excellent, we really liked them., but pricey. The fries....just OK, not worth $3.  We ordered four burgers and  only three burgers were brought out. Had to go ask about the missing burger, staff seemed to be discussing who screwed up, was there a screwup, etc. Finally got the missing burger.  At this point a manager really should have stopped by and said, \"Hey, sorry about the mixup.\"  Nothing but teenagers running this place, so that didn't happen.  I hope nobody mortaged their house to get this place up and running.  It may not make it due to the high prices and iffy service.  It's a shame."}
{"text":"Cute place. Order at counter. Server really nice and knowledgeable. I ordered the Pork Belly  sandwiches and Baldie got the Classic burger. His burger was delicious, juicy, flavorful. We ordered truffle Parmesan fries that were perfectly seasoned and deliciously crispy. The regular fries were pretty good too. One out of two of my pork belly sandwich had more fat ratio to meat. The other sandwich was the opposite. However both were a little bit dry on the meat part. Other than that, it was delicious. The cilantro, carrots and all the other additions to the sandwich made it very flavorful. The rice bun with nice and soft and fluffy and the sauce they used was delicious. I would definitely go back but I would probably get a burger."}
{"text":"Best burgers we have ever had!!! The fries were delicious! I wish they would expand into the Cola, SC area."}
{"text":"The food was great, and the service was excellent. I definitely recommend Blacow Burger if you're in the Fort Mill area."}
{"text":"Had the Hangover.  Truffle oil was overpowering and took away from the burger.  Also had black bean patty on the garden salad. Nothing special and the citrus dressing was too oily.  No one came over to see how we were doing. Overall not worth the high prices."}
{"text":"We are here on their GRAND OPENING! The staff was friendly and explained some of the components on their menu. Its a little pricy, but its top grade, fresh meat and AMAZING flavor.  I got The Cabellero burger. It ranked in my top 5 burgers of all time. Seriously good. Well seasoned, crunchy onion strings, well cooked bacon, melty cheese, and DELICIOUS chipoltle mayo. I need to talk about the guacamole by itself for a second. Usually I'm dissapointed with the guac that comes on a burger. Its like they dont try to add flavor, might as well just be mashed avocado.   NOT THIS PLACE! I would eat that guac in a bowl with a spoon. So good. I kind of want another one even though I'm full up. (I didnt get a side, the portion of the burger was filling by itself)   All in all, super happy. I'll definitlu be back, and I hope they do well!"}
{"text":"What a great experience!! I was heading over to Charlotte with my husband when we decided to stop into Blacow. Now let me tell you that I know burgers! While pregnant with my 2 daughters, that's all I craved and all that I ate. I've eaten everything from the $20 fancy burgers to the $1 fast food burgers so I know the difference in the quality of the burger.  With that said, I order the flaming cow burger with an order of cheese fries and a coffee shake. You could tell the fries were fresh, not like McDonald's fries and the coffee shake was good, not too sweet. The burger was definitely the best part of the meal though. The meat was cooked perfectly and you could taste that it was a good quality beef patty. Instead of tasting like rubber, it actually tasted like meat. The ghost pepper jack cheese added a nice kick to the burger along with the sriracha mayo.   The staff was very friendly and the overall we had a wonderful experience. I would definitely come back here and would recommend Blacow to anyone who's looking for good quality food."}
{"text":"Garlic Parmesan Truffle Fries!!! Can we say it again...Garlic Parmesan Truffle Fries!!! Trust me...get'em, they're awesome. Burgers are the best in the Charlotte Metro area too. Almost lost a star or two because it's a touch pricey and the cashier always seems mad (the guys who delivers the food though is on his A game with service) ....but no lost stars. Thank the fries!"}
{"text":"Best artisan burger I've had in years. I tried the Nutty Goat and the flavor and textures were incredible. I will be back to try their other burgers for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Gluten and Dairy Free options. Try the Goat and F.R.O.G. Loved loved loved."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this awesome burger place in Fort Mill. It used to be fast casual with more Korean inspired burgers, but now it's a sit down and most of the Korean inspiration seems to be gone.   The menu is still awesome. I decided to go with the nutty goat burger this time. The goat cheese was awesome. I also tried some of my friends hangover burger which was pretty good, but a lot going on. We tried the Parmesan truffle fries, the cheesy bacon ranch fries, and the poutine. My favorite was definitely the cheesy bacon ranch. I've had the Brussels sprouts and they are awesome.   I didn't have room for dessert this time, but I definitely want to try a shake sometime.   Now that it's a sit down restaurant, the service seems to be a little slow, but the food makes up for it.   I definitely recommend trying out this place for some great burgers!"}
{"text":"Cashier was super friendly and nice. However, we ordered our burger medium-rare and it was medium- well and we got our order to go. We got home and they never gave us one of our fries."}
{"text":"Been twice in 3 days.. the burgers are super good and the creations are on point. So glad we went out to try it. I had the blacow burger which has tempura avocado, teriyaki glaze with some other things. It's fantastic. The meat is fresh and a combo and top quality meat - Wagyu, short rib etc.  Took our friends today and they got the big willie - has pork belly bacon on the burger - they said was he best burger they've ever had.  I must admit - if not the best, it's top 3... The onion rings are the best I've had for sure. Not overly greasy and the sauce is great!   I read people complaining about price - As I did about Wahlbugers in Myrtle Beach.. But the prices here are not bad at all based on the type of meat used and the creations with the Asian fusion. You will pay $10-$12 for your burger entree but that also include your side. This isn't McDonalds so stop thinking that should be the price you pay. I'm telling you, the food here is incredible.   The fries could have been warmer - but didn't change my opinion. We love this place and will be back often.    My next choice will be the flaming cow that should pack a lot of heat. Ghost pepper jack, jalapeño coins, surracha etc.    Anyway, hope you try it and enjoy as much as we did."}
{"text":"Great burgers! For 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 2 drinks it was a little over $30. A little more than we wanted to spend, but the food was very good."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, homemade buns, and hand cut fries.  If we lived remotely closer, I'd try some different menu items, but for the same price as Five Guys ($25 for 2), we got higher quality food with a more comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Even though this is a burger place, I ended up getting the southern chicken club without the bun/cucumber/ranch, partly because I wasn't sure how I'd like the short rib steak they used to make the burgers. My sandwich was delish though so no regrets. Hubby got the swiss fun-ghi burger which he enjoyed as well. I saw a suggestion to get the parmesan garlic fries and am so glad I did because they were so good. The fry servings are also very generous which I loved. FYI  consider this place 5 stars, but hubby said 4 since he's had slightly better bleu burgers."}
{"text":"Excellent burger.  Premium meat but the difference is the bun.  Great fries and shake."}
{"text":"Great food and great service for this neighborhood burger joint! If you haven't tried it you're missing out! Blacow is the BOMB!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice & thought the burgers were very good both times.  They have a plain burger & then a variety of other items that I would have never thought of but glad they did.  I had the Caballero but subbed avocado for guac.  My friend had the fruit salad for her side & it was all fresh cut.    Only reason I don't go more often is it's out of the way for me."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Blacow changed from \"fast casual\" format to standard table service.  As a loyal fan, this is a downgrade in experience.  Hoping this is just an experiment to compete with recently opened Smashburger, and fingers crossed Blacow returns to the original fast casual format.  With the old format, as a family of 6 we could enjoy a great meal in 30 minutes.  The new format (albeit with early kinks) is 2-3x slower.  Blacow, please bring back fast causal!  We  Blacow.  Great meal, very family friendly format with \"fast casual\" (think Pei Wei, Panera, etc).  Located in the space formerly occupied by Jumpin Java, this is a welcome addition to the Baxter area of Fort Mill.  Some of my favorites: any burger with the Wagyu beef, the brussel sprouts with balsamic (def beats fries), and the salted caramel milkshakes.  The kids like the macaroni and cheese, or the cut fruit, as sides, and of course any of the milkshakes.  Atmosphere is relaxed and clean.  Service is fast and low key."}
{"text":"Of course, my eye was drawn to the expensive burgers on the menu and so I enjoyed their Hangover Burger even though I was not hung over. Big beef patty, bacon, cheese, a fried egg and a french fries/poutine thing on the burger. When delivered to my table, the thing was seven inches tall. Do people try and bite into this monster?  I took much of the burger apart and ate some with knife and fork until it was down to a manageable size. Tasty beef and the egg was nice. Bacon was very bacony.  For my side dish, I chose the mac & cheese which was okay not great. A big portion but needed sriracha for some kick.  Great service and a neat spot that's right off the highway and easy access. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they didn't understand that I wanted a different cheese on my burger but, they got it wrong twice. The patty itself was good but I can't say much for the rest of it."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and fries. Had the caballero burger and it was delicious. The burger with the marmalade and the goat cheese was also good."}
{"text":"I had the Nutty burger (substituted for a turkey patty). It was everything I could have hoped for! Presentation was great!"}
{"text":"Blacowwwwwwwwwwwww. Perfect way to describe the burgers here.We are in love! This place apparently is fairly new. Heard of Blacow thru word of mouth. Boy they didn't steer us wrong with the burgers here. Oh how i wish i didn't have any complaints but i do. Just one complaint that is so major to me. When we arrived the tables weren't cleaned or wiped down, as we looked around we also noticed how the floors appeared to not have been swept what looked like in days. The bathroom wasn't the cleanest either. Being that it was all of probably two customers in here sitting down when we arrived im just a little confused to why it wouldn't be a little more tidy ? That issue would definitely have to be addressed before i step foot back in Blacow."}
{"text":"I have found an new burger joint for me to now go to.   The first pics are the Korean burger with pull pork so awesome and right on the mark.  The next 2 are the caballa and this month's special with like 3 types of bacon. Everyone enjoyed theirs and was a pleasant surprise. The fries were nice too.  Sweet tea was not overly sweet which is the way I like it.  It would have gotten 5 stars except for wait to be seated. They weren't overly crowded but needing to be seated as a little bit pointless. Would be better to leave the menu on the tables and just keep an eye on who's coming in.  Definitely will be coming back again. So many options that need to be tried out"}
{"text":"Well.. if you think you can order online/app at 7:11pm and swing by after leaving FMHS, to grab your 1burger on the way home ... you would be sadly mistaken! It's 7:31 and we are still waiting on our carry out! AND THe PLACE IS EMPTY!"}
{"text":"Could have been a 5 star.... the food was amazing. Great burgers! Amazing fries! PRICE.....? Stupid! I got a burger and parm truffle fries and a 12oz IPA $22! I don't mind paying $22 for a meal. But not a order at the counter burger place! There are other burger and beer places near by where I can pay $22 plus tip and get a just as good if not better for and have it all served to me. I went back up to buy a 16oz hop drop and roll, $8.25. Seriously... that's stupid!! I give it 2 starts cause it was good! But I will not be back tell the price drops to what it's worth."}
{"text":"Stopped on my way down 77 on a Friday night with my wife and eldest son.  Decor is run off the mill which set me off at first, but one look at the menu got me excited.  Lots of unique menu items.   I got the Blacow Burger, Kim got the Hangover and Michael got the Flaming Cow.  Thumbs up across the board.  They went traditional with fries and I picked balsamic vinegar baked brussel sprouts.  Darn fine choice.   Service could have been faster, but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"\"The gobble\" was one of the best turkey burgers I had in a while.  It was a healthier version of a burger.  You will not be disappointed"}
