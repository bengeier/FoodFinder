{"text":"Very bad food. Honestly couldn't eat it. Had to go get more lunch elsewhere and ended up tossing most of the food i got at Zita. Chicken was full of fat and cartilidge GROSS! Salad tasted like someone dumped vinegar all over it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked over to the lovely man standing at this place. He was so friendly and greeted us with such kindness. We asked him what he recommended and he pointed out the Gyro/fry/drink combo for $7.49. It was delicious and so filling. While eating he brought us dessert! It was also delicious!! He was so kind and inviting! We would recommend this restaurant to everyone we know."}
{"text":"This place is Not Good...Not Good at all. The Gyro meat was less than warm and the tzatziki sauce had no flavor. My wife had a greek salad and she thought it was below par. The good things I guess were the french fries and free soda refills. The only person happy was my 9 year old daughter...she ate at Sbarros."}
{"text":"The woman working the counter seemed to resent me ordering food. I tried to order a gyro and a large drink and I ended up with a combo plate of fries and a small drink. I asked not to have any of the green tomatoes but she didn't listen and after the first large heaping spoon full of tsaziki sauce I asked her to stop and she added another. The food in my opinion was not worth the price and of poor quality."}
{"text":"So good! Best falafel I've ever had! Generous portions and everything was very fresh! Awesome little family ran place! Come try it you won't regret it ;)"}
{"text":"Won't be eating here again. The tzatziki sauce was waterey and bland. Should be flavorful and creamy. The service was ok but the food was subpar."}
{"text":"We tried this new place in the Superstition Springs Mall Food Court. Even though we ate close to closing time, all of the food looked very fresh. We enjoyed the beef and lamb gyros as well as the salads and the yellow rice was very nicely seasoned with saffron. We will definitely be going back SOON!"}
