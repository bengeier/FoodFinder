{"text":"Usually we receive great service but of late the food has been a tad inconsistent. We have been going here since the place opened. The original owner sold the place many years back. He remained onsite to help with the transition for awhile. Since then some of the items on the menu have taken on slightly different flavours. They are okay but unexpected. I will return because it is fairly dependable so when I need a fix of German food this is where I come to get it."}
{"text":"I am all about supporting local business but sadly this will not be one of them. After reading the Yelp reviews for Sauter's Inn we decided to try their breakfast menu. Big mistake.  I ordered Eggs Benedict. This dish is the measure of any good breakfast cook/kitchen and when done right you can usually trust everything else on the breakfast menu to be palatable. I was served overcooked yolks! I asked the server to send it back to the kitchen and she did so with a puzzled look on her face. Apparently no customer has ever complained about ruined Eggs Benedict before. A short while later a new plate returned to my table. This time the egg yolks were done right but the English muffin beneath seems to have only been given a remote glance of the kitchen's toaster. The home fires were beyond disgusting. Home fires should have more flavor than just the grease from the deep fryer. The Hollandaise sauce was also bland and flavorless. In summary, this has to be the worst Eggs Benedict I have ever been served. I also have to mention the tepid barley drinkable Coffee. Free refills only make it worse.  I don't fault the staff for the terrible food. I blame the business owners. It appears that they don't care about growing their business anymore and are content with the few repeat customers who care more about routine rather than the quality of of the food being served to them.  We will not be returning, Ever."}
{"text":"Been going here for years but after ownership changed, the food went downhill.  Schitzel are paper thin and not worth the money.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"what a cute joint! a half-timber building with a dining room decorated in a ton of German/Hungarian knick knacks all over.   super quiet during lunchtime on a Saturday; we (including a few others after us) had come in thinking the signs outside meant all-day breakfast, but alas brekkie ends at 12 here. the lady (owner?) was kind enough to suggest a different place down the road for all day breakfast but one look at the menu and I figured it'd be worth a shot staying.   so glad we did cause the food here is delicious; the WIENER SCHNITZEL is so tender and breading nice and crisp. we opted to order a creamy wine sauce with mushrooms on the side (from the Geschnitzeltes Züricher Art dish) and ohhhhhhh my it was so heavenly. the Hungarian-style CABBAGE ROLL also hit the spot; a good amount of hearty with meat and rice filling and homemade tomato sauce and everything well seasoned. both entrees came with home fries (pretty basic) and vegetables (potatoes, cauliflower, potatoes, broccoli) cooked in a light white sauce that was also so bomb.  in comparison with the dinner menu, the lunch options (half the price!) are just as plenty and portion sizes aren't skimpy at all. this restaurant completely took my stomach back to Germany - DAS IST GUT."}
{"text":"Worse place ever! Food was served lukewarm. Meals were prepared in a microwave. My spätzle was still watery and they didn't even bother to drain it before serving it to me. Bill for 3 people was over $150. Waste."}
{"text":"Traditional German food, the staff is extremely nice and welcoming. Pretty much the only people that go here are seniors that eat schnitzel, but the pasta I got one time was really good. It is a tad more expensive than a regular family restaurant but thats because its a really small family business."}
{"text":"The wife and I have driven past this small enclave of Bavaria on Kingston Road in Ajax multiple times and said we should try it out.    So we stopped by. Before entering I checked Yelp!  Sadly there were only 5 reviews but with the majority offering 4 of 5 stars we went it.    The place is the German version of an English pub.  We were there at 6:15 pm on a Thursday.  There was only us and another couple there.    My wife noticed a musty smell.  Similar to a cottage being opened for the first time.  We had the pork schnitzel.  But you don't go to a German pub for a hamburger or veal parmigiana.  I had the breaded schnitzel and my wife had un breaded with gravy and spatzel.    Both meals were hot and the portions decent.  I found that I needed something on my schnitzel as it was dry especially with home fries and red cabbage.  My wife felt hers was a bit tasteless.  I guess I was underwhelmed by the food but the musty smell and lack of customers left us with a cold experience."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a friday night. it was not very packed. but from the beginning looking at the outside design. it really did look like a german pub in old style germany. The interior was very nice and the staff was friendly.   The placed was not very packed for a friday night. Immediately we saw the specials were the german pork hock, which is a famous german dish, and the garlic butter pork chop. so we decided to ordered the specials as well as the appetizer of escargot garlic butter.   The complimentary german and escargot were disappointing, as they were both pretty cold. and the escargot was barely heated at all. The garlic bread was also cold You can tell it was pre-done a while back.   on to the main course, the German pork hock, had a good layer and was oven backed. although the outer layer was very soft, the inside when you get to the core is very overcooked and rough. So overall it is a good dish, but by no means the best it could be.   The garlic butter pork chop was not bad, although it was nothing special. it was particular soft, or particularly tender.   The desert was pretty good. the desert was perhaps the best parts. the raspberry puree for the desert is one of the best part of the peach marbila.  and the apple strudle with ice cream, it is very hot and taste ready made.   Overall the 4 star reflect a good dining experience, although of course i would not say it is the best german food around."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit Sauter's for the very first time on my birthday. We were a party of 4 and immediately mentioned that we'd be ordering schnitzel. Since I know Schnitzel is usually made with veal I didn't bother to ask but my husband thought we should since I don't eat pork. To my surprise the server said \"it's pork!\". I asked if it was all pork and she said yes but there is chicken too or veal.. an extra dollar for veal. I was relieved and agreed even though I found it odd since prices were already pretty high on the menu.  Kind of unprofessional.   Anyway she took all our orders and comes back to tell me that they are out of veal but I could have chicken!  I was really disapointed at this point since it seemed there was little if anything on the menu that I could order. I asked about the daily specials and she said duck, so I agreed to have the duck and then she told me \"it's not part of the birthday special\"   I told my husband to order the duck instead for me, and I would order what he wanted. We asked what the duck was exactly and she said in a heavy indian accent \"Duck feet\"  We were all very confused so we opted to just forget about it.  I ordered the hungarian goulash and when it arrived it had a pungent almost indian mango chutney flavour to it. The sauce was full of tomato peels and the spaetzle was HORRIBLE and dry (I'm German and we cook German food at home all the time so I know what I'm talking about)   Everyone was disappointed with their entrees and the price was very high. A really bad experience, one I'll never forget and definitely not going back to try the schnitzel whenever veal becomes available!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat brunch here on Sundays almost every week.  They have a great breakfast special for $4.99 that keeps us coming back.  The food is good and you get large portions for the price.  The service is friendly and quick.  We've been going there every week for almost a year and haven't had a bad meal.  The decor is old school and quirky compared to any modern restaurant but that's what makes it different."}
{"text":"i went to this place based on an online recommendation. and really expected something great. first ordered an appetizer and felt like it was cols. the escargot. so really was disappointed with it. and the bread provided was not very good it was cold as well.   the restaurant decor was nice. i ordered a pork hock. and i felt it was very big certainly definitely seems more a portion for two people. i think the taste was not bad. but the meat was overcooked.   got desert afterwards. had the peach desert. i felt it was very good probably best thing in the meal because of the puree they used. the raspberry puree was very fresh and just the right combination.   overall i felt this place was not bad. but not spectacular by any means. i would go to it sometimes. but probably only once in a while. i would recommend those in the area who crave german food should give it a try."}
{"text":"This restaurant is delicious. Generous sized portions. Hot food. Nice atmosphere. Whenever iI go there. Usually fridays i find the place either packed or not busy at all. It is hit or miss. I usually get the sampler dish that has a bit of everything and it can feed a family of four no problem! I highly suggest eating here."}
{"text":"The $4.99 special is what drew us here. We were surprised they still offered it on the weekends.  One slice of toast, 3 eggs, home fries and your choice of one of the following: 4 sausages, 2 pieces of peameal bacon or 2 pieces of side bacon.  Everything was cooked perfectly and delicious. The coffee is bottomless and an extra $2.25 but it is worth it. This was hands down the best coffee we've ever had. It's some commercial blend that is brewed in a machine right before it's served to you. The aroma is something we've never had before. Will definitely come back for the coffee alone. Our server was very friendly and accommodating even though we brought two young ones. The atmosphere was very quaint and relaxing. Great start to our day! Thanks!"}
