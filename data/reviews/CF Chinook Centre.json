{"text":"Great Mall Im happy to see their expanding it. Cool shops indeed. Nothing really here to complain about!  Love the touches to the sculptures of the polar bears for the winter! and the sales in some of the stores!!! Keep the good work up."}
{"text":"The general consensus is parking BAD, Stores Good.  I can say I agree. I worked retail for a couple years at Market so I know how lame malls can be.   I will agree something HAS to be done with the traffic flow. Four way stops and three way stops just don't cut it. Apparently stop signs are the center of all confusion. The parking here has made me want to cry on a number of occasions.   Also people parking on the end of parking rows in a non-stall causing unneeded traffic jams should be towed or something! Tickets aren't enough because they are impeding traffic flow!   The mall seems to have strange peak hours. Most malls can trend for regular busy hours but Chinook I find is busy at the strangest times.  I like the selection of stores although I find the higher end stores have some pretty snobby staff. I have gotten lots of attention from Coach, Burberry and Tiffany so kudos for customer service.  They also have stores that other malls do not have such as the lego store! I like coming here once and awhile. Still having lots of reno's inside though."}
{"text":"Eh- it's okay...BUSY all the time. Parking is a nightmare and full of people. Stores are great but i would rather leave with my car intact...thanks"}
{"text":"Canadian malls are so cool. The only problem with Chinook mall is now that I'm back in the US it makes the malls near me seem really lame. We don't have giant polar bear statues :(."}
{"text":"good variety of stores - many high end stores and a really large centre. found it quite surprising that there were no sale racks in the stores we checked out - have never been in a mall without them!!   would recommend checking out the floorplan before you go so that you can park close to where you would like to go as it is quite a hike from one end of the mall to the other!"}
{"text":"Parking sucks, I hate that it takes cars right up to the pedestrian traffic but the new parkade is pretty good.  The addition of the new shops is awesome, love this mall!"}
{"text":"Parking - the stall lights in the underground parking don't work, so ignore them. Just suffice it to say that you will find a spot on your own eventually - sometimes quickly, sometimes it takes a little longer. It has an Apple Store, a Chapters and a Second Cup - I'm happy.  The Purdy's there doesn't sell their Chili Chocolate squares - I'm not happy (The Southcentre Mall's Purdy's gets my business.) Clothing and everything else - it's a mall. Most anything else I need is also in just about every other mall, so no sense driving all the way there and look for parking if not in the area. BUT, what wins them for me - they support community with the Remembrance Display and Poppy Fund service in October/November. And they do have the largest and possibly best-run Stampede Pancake Breakfast in the city. Both of those are must-attend events."}
{"text":"Probably the biggest mall in Calgary, Chinook Centre has everything shoppers would need. The parking situation has always been an issue however, and now they're giving away my secret on lame radio ads. Park behind the place. How stupid are people, that they need to be told to find parking around the back of the building? I know how stupid they are because I've witnessed these lunatics drive in circles waiting to pounce on an available spot in the heavily congested front end.  So, there. If you're stupid or just have a tendency to drive in circles, you can park around back. I can't believe they have to take out ads informing people of this, but what the hell. It must be some prestige thing to park in the front, because you know, that way people...can SEE me....  That's sad."}
{"text":"This mall has almost everything, but it's long so not always convenient if you need stores at either ends. And it is always busy!"}
{"text":"This place changed so much since my days here as a greasy teenager. Always the place to go after school, this mall is the centerpoint for many kids in my highschool. Had a few jobs here as well.  Nice ambience, as well as a few stores you wouldnt find anywhere else in Calgary. All hail the food court!"}
{"text":"I dislike this mall for a number of reasons. Parking can be a major pain in the ass sometimes, and some of their parking lots are creepy. The mall in itself is huge, making it pretty difficult to get from one end to the other, add a Saturday crowd to that matter and it is even more difficult. Personally some of the store they have that can only be found in Edmonton (Hollister, Abercrombie, Forever 21, etc.), I don't care for so that's not an appealing factor for me to go to this mall. Their fire drill seems to go off fairly frequently too, but you can't hear the announcement over the general sound of mall goers so there's this constant questioning of \"Is this another drill, or should I really be running for my life right now?\" Also, at Southcentre there is security constantly walking around, creating this sense of security, but you don't have that at Chinook so I wonder what happens in emergencies? Oh and there are far too few washrooms considering the size of the place (a complaint that can be made for every mall from Cross Iron to Southcentre).  What are my positives? I guess it is like a one stop shop. Wanna see a movie? Go bowling? Grab dinner... maybe some drinks? Do shopping? It can all be done in this one location that is easily accessible by road or transit! And it's a kind of central location so it isn't too difficult to access. Yeah... that's about it."}
{"text":"I really cant stand this place.  Reason being is its very hard to get in and out of there in a car let alone on foot.  It seems the whole of Calgary comes to this particular mall!  Sure you have your Chapters, a nice Sheffields & Sons, and decent food court but in the end its just too cramped for me.  Mind you since they built the new underground parking it has helped immensley....but before that this place was an absolute nightmare to get out of! With its cramped design, tons of shoppers and sitting just off a very busy street I try to stay away as much as I can!"}
{"text":"One of the biggest shopping malls in Calgary, it carries some big names in fashion and other stores. Highly recommended if you're in town for some shopping."}
{"text":"I can understand why people complain about the parking but you can avoid the whole horror show by parking in the underground parking in the back of the mall. It's not a big deal. I like this place because it has lots of stores that other malls in Calgary don't have like Scotch & Soda and Nordstrom. I'd recommend coming to this place if you're looking for something different that Southcentre won't offer."}
{"text":"I find market mall Sephora better. The staff at this location tend to stand around and talk rather than help customers."}
{"text":"Really liked it... Lots of variety ..."}
{"text":"Sure, it's not dissimilar to many malls I've been to in the U.S. This one offers an Egyptian theme, particularly in the attached movie theatre to the south-side of the mall. I was taken aback by the amount of multiple locations of various vendors (Jugo Juice, some of the technology vendors etc.), to the point of having 3 or more locations, which seems to me as unusual in U.S. malls. I enjoyed having lunch from Thai Express, walking around the mall in general, and also browsing the Chapters bookstore (although it seems to highly resemble Borders stores in the U.S., I can't seem to find any info the two store chains are related in any way). Last Saturday the place appeared to also provide a haven for Stampeders escaping out of the rain. Certainly a more enjoyable mall than others I've been to across the continent."}
{"text":"Great mall with lots of selection.  During the Christmas season it can get a little crazy trying to maneuver through the sheer volume of people but that's true of most malls at that time of year.  Parking is never really an issue and the Ctrain has a stop just 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"Huge variety of stores and some high end boutiques. Some parts of the mall need a face lift as other parts are absolutely gorgeous.   Food court has many options to choose from, but not a lot of seating on the weekends. Make sure you scout out a seat before getting your food!    Parking stalls underground and covered parking have green and red lights to let you know if a spot is occupied or unoccupied. Very useful feature which I thought was super cool, I definitely think it's a feature all major malls should have.   In my opinion, I think Chinook is much more better than cross iron!"}
{"text":"Chinook center, is the biggest mall Calgary has. It has undergone several renovations over the years. The addition of the new wing, is very clean and bright. It makes the rest of the mall seem like it needs updating. I like the new underground heated parkade. It makes shopping with the family a little easier. I even like to take my jacket off, and leave it in the car. Also the car has a chance to defrost on those minus 20-30 temps. Located in the mall, is a  fair sized food court  with huge windows. If anyone remembers the old food court, It was a tiny little thing located by the professional building off the second floor. located in the center, is also a movie theater, with a few arcade games and fast food restos. located also in the center on the lower level is a bowling alley. If you like 5 pin bowling then you'll like this place. (I just hate wearing the shoes). A little history, at the end where the movie theater is located was a Woodwards food floor, which later became a Safeway that was also accessible from the mall. On the outside perimeter their are a few full service restaurants, like Globefish, Joeys, etc. On the outside (not accessible from the mall) is Chop. Its a stand alone, that share the parking lot with Chinook, located on the southside. All the restaurants are not accessible from within the mall, with the exception of Boston pizza. BP is located on the upper level, close to Sears down the west corridor. If your shopping for a B-day present etc or simply for yourself, Chinook is almost certain to have what you need."}
{"text":"Love, love. love the new addition at Chinook.  It has definitely added a new feeling to the mall.  Here's why I liked it so much....  1. Parking in the new North parking deck.  The ceilings are high enough for my ginormous SUV to fit no problem (just make sure when exiting you don't go through the West parkade because it is very short).  The lights to tell you which stalls are open are awesome too.  Even on a busy Sunday there was tons of open parking.  2.  High end stores & stores that you don't see at every mall.  Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Hollister, Burberry, etc.  Awesome stores even if you are just there to browse.  3.  All that extra square footage means that even on a busy Christmas weekend it wasn't that crowded.    All in all, I will be back to finish my Christmas shopping!"}
{"text":"The underground heated parking at Chinook Centre is a god-send in the winter. That is when I go there most often, for a reprieve from the cold weather. I do my best to avoid busier times and the Christmas shopping season, it is too busy and stressful. It is a very large mall with lots of regular mall stuff, plus some offerings that are less common place. There is a large movie Theatre, a bowling alley and a several department stores. There are numerous restaurants. The food court is as ordinary as can be in regards to selection. They have a merry-go-round in the food court - great for entertaining young kids. It is often crowded and the layout of the mall is a bit strange, it just kept getting added onto over the years, growing increasingly larger.   Some places of Interest at Chinook Centre.  *** Phil and Sebastian Coffee *** Sephora *** Georges Cookies *** Nine West *** Rocky Mountain Soap Company *** Mac Make-up *** Globefish Sushi *** Hat Store"}
{"text":"Best mall in Calgary? You could say so. They have almost everything here. Movie theatre. Foot locker. Food court. Apple store. And even a Zara and HM. There are also many restaurants around this mall as well."}
{"text":"Yes, Chinook Centre is the biggest mall in Calgary (I specify Calgary because I realize that CrossIron Mills mall in Balzac is much bigger now), but I rarely go there.   Yes there is a HUGE variety of shops there, but It's ALWAYS packed. Especially during this time of year, it's unbearably packed and it's only going to get worse in the weeks approaching December.  And although I absolutely LOVE their movie theatre, I find the mall and the store owners to be rather pretentious.   The last time I went there, I asked a store owner if I could try something on and she just looked at me and responded by saying \"ONLY if you're seriously considering buying it\". Well I'll tell ya what, I wouldn't BUY something I didn't try on, so I just turned around and walked out.  Definitely not the greatest mall I've been to, and quite frankly even if it was, you wouldn't catch me there very often."}
{"text":"Love, love. love Chinook Centre.  Favorite mall in Calgary. Especially since they have gone through so many renovations over the years and have acquired allot of great stores.  1. Parking and there is lots of it. I prefer to park by Nordstrom's underground and each time have had no problem finding any. It's always busy but I always find a spot to park my massive SUV.  2.  High end stores & stores that you don't see at every mall.  Anthropologie, Tory Burch, Burberry, etc. etc.  A bit for everyone. From high end to the basic's like Gap, H&M and all that good stuff.  3.  Fantastic food court with lots of variety. Everything from A&W, Choices, Thai, Chinese food as well as plenty of seating.    All in all, I will be back many times."}
{"text":"Ah, the Chinook Mall. It has morphed so much over the years. At one point back when I lived in Canmore, this would be the mall we would *always* hit up when we came to town. They have always had a great variety of shops, which was a godsend as a kid. I have two older sisters, so while they and my mom would spend hours clothes shopping for this and that, my dad and I would hit up the electronics stores and anything else not related to clothes.  I quite enjoy the expansion they have done, except the part where it's made parking that much more of a pain. These days, I'm more likely to just avoid it all together unless I'm looking for something specific (ie at one point the Phil and Sebastian coffee shop there was the closest one to me).  On the upside, their food court is quite spacious, with lots of windows at one end - that makes it feel quite huge, and depending on the time of the year, the sun will blast through.  Inevitably, I'll be back. However, I will likely opt to go via transit, as parking can be quite nightmarish."}
{"text":"While visiting in Calgary, stopped by the Chinook Centre.  It's a great mall.   There's utilitarian stores like Sears and Zellers, Apparel stores like Hollister and Roots, as well as Electronics retailers like Best Buy Mobile and Apple Store.  It's a good Middle Class mall.  The food court has a lot of variety.  It also has a large movie theater on site. It's appears to be a good one-stop shopping place.  A good place to kill a few hrs. The only thing missing are ultra -Luxury stores like Rolex and Louis Vuitton.  There is a Burberry store though."}
{"text":"My fiance and I stopped at this mall for a brief visit on our way home from Vancouver back to Edmonton. This mall is pretty decent. Parking can be a pain in the butt but we were able to find parking on a Saturday mid-morning after circling just a couple times.  Inside, you'll find your staple stores, plus some exclusive stores such as Nordstrom's and the Cineplex movie theatre. The mall is kept quite clean, tons families, couples,  friends walking around.   This is definitely one of the nicer malls in town, if not the nicest. If you're stopping in Calgary for a visit and want to check out a mall that should most people's needs, then I'd recommend this one over any other."}
{"text":"Now I have to start off this review honestly and say that I'm not really into shopping malls to begin with. I avoid crowds, but I love shopping- so if I have to go to the mall, I'm probably going to do it on a weekday morning.  My mom and I ventured into Chinook on Saturday specifically to visit La Senza and spend a gift card. It seemed like we were pretty lucky with parking- we found a nice big spot immediately in the back parking lot. I see that other reviews talk about how parking can be a nightmare here, and I can totally see it. They have a valet service, and traffic around the mall was totally bananas by the time we left.   The inside of the mall is spacious and quite nice. They have an interesting mix of stores, both high-end and small boutiques. And a LOT of cell phone shops.   It took us a very long hike to find La Senza- the mall has a unique layout and it is easy to get lost (and I come from the city of West Edmonton Mall, so I know what I'm talking about here!) However, we did find it and the ladies inside were lovely and very helpful and we managed to spend the whole gift card.   So it seems like a pretty decent mall, though it doesn't have many of my favourite stores all in close proximity.  Pros: more exercise as part of your shopping experience :)  Cons: a LOT of walking."}
{"text":"Larger, usually more crowded than the other malls, good selection of stores. My hubby gives this Mall 4 stars... me 3. I have seen many a Mall in my day and forgive me for having visions of open air malls in Hawaii but this Mall for me is just average-style. I do not like the location for us, but if you live south, everything you could possibly need is in this Mall. Sephora, Body Shop, Shoppers, Lush etc for the ladies, tons of clothing stores, Sports stores for the guys, Build A Bear for the kids... What I do like is the Food Court and how that is laid out compared to other Malls and how clean it is in comparison too. The Chapters in the Mall is amazing as well as Coach... I could go on and on. The movie theatre right there is attached as well as Chop ( I recommend for drinks only over food) if you want to wet your whistle while you shop! Lots of Mall security who are high visibility - never hurts. So much traffic though. Just getting into the Mall when it is busy on a weekend is nuts! Goes with the territory! Happy Shopping!"}
{"text":"Very large mall, lots of shops and a decent food court. I visited on boxing day and the crowds were insane...Black Friday has nothing on Boxing Day madness! I would definitely visit again, just on a different day!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  For us, this alone was worth the drive from Edmonton.  It has far more \"outlet\" type shops than Crossiron Mills, and an upscale vibe.  Definitely the place to shop if you're in Cowtown for a visit!"}
{"text":"This is your basic mall with all the regular stores you would find in the USA or Canada.  It is a modern and clean shopping center with many of the popular stores so you should be able to find what you're looking for here.  Not the fanciest of malls in the world, but it does the job quite nicely when commuting around Calgary."}
{"text":"I'm just going to assume this is for people not from Calgary... because if you've been in Calgary for more than about a month and HAVEN'T been to Chinook, I can only assume you've made the conscious choice to avoid it, and thus don't need my review.  This is basically THE mall in Calgary. If there's a major retailer that routinely shows up in malls, there's a pretty good chance it's in Chinook, and it's that kind of \"it has everything\" mentality that brings me back here again and again and again. It's a well known and accepted fact that most guys aren't mall people, but I'll be the first to admit I'd almost rather go to a store at Chinook rather than a standalone store, cause I know chances are I can kill 3,4 or sometimes 10 birds with one stone here.  To add to that, it's not only nice and close to a C-Train station (about 3 blocks away), but if you're too lazy to walk THAT (and sometimes I am) there's even a FREE shuttle bus that runs from the station to the south end of the mall, right in front of one of my other main reasons to love this mall.... the movie theater!  Sure, these days lots of malls are located right by movie theaters... but there's the catch. This one isn't NEAR the mall, it's ATTACHED to the mall, which (especially in cold Calgary winters) is a very good thing. Add this to the fact that this is, I believe, still the biggest theater in Calgary, the only one with an IMAX screen, and home to one of the cities 2 Ultra AVX auditoriums AND D-Box motion seating, and this is one \"best in the city\" location attached to another. How do you beat that?  Of course, if you're driving, you should be aware that parking here can get a bit crazy at times, and leave some people pulling their hair out... but given that you're going to the most frequented mall in the city which is built at the intersection of two of the main drags (thus negating the chances of a big lot) that's to be expected, and I think they do a lot better than I would have expected, given the circumstances. (Bit of a tip, if you enter from the west into the area behind, or park in the garage beside the theater, these are probably your best options in terms of finding a spot.)  ...and besides, how many times can you say you've been to a food court that practically looks like an amusement park? That alone should win it some cool points there."}
{"text":"I like that this mall is central in the city of Calgary so that people form the north and the south connect here. It is busy any day of the week and at anytime. I also like that they are now creating a big pedestrian bridge to go over rather than the sidewalks getting full of people waiting to cross as it is such a popular mall.  However, as it is so popular and this mall has stores in it that most around the city don't have such as Tiffany's, Kate Spade and the Apple Store the fact that the mall has very little parking is inconvenient.  However, I do like that the mall has a caracul in it to help keep kids occupied."}
{"text":"*DINOS, TIGERS AND CROWDS OH MY!*   Chinook is the largest mall in Calgary, it's hard not to expect noisy crowds of people (some going the wrong way) other bumping into you... but during early morning and the middle of the week the places is virtually a ghost town. By noon that's when the rush comes due to Lunch time and people taking breaks.  For the most part the place is clean, the food court has a fair variety of foods, Chinese, Japanese, Greek, Southern hospitality, and your A&W, Subway etc...  What makes the dining experience worth while is the ceiling in the food court, a cleverly designed moving art with various types of aerodynamic contraptions spinning and flying in circles. Occasionally the mall will offer free fashion shows, breast cancer awareness and random new Art Statues that magically appear over night.   The main entrance has an exceptionally welded Metal tyrannosaurus, standing 15 feet tall and starring out to the parkade.  Now about the Parkade the key is to remember where you parked because the place has 3 main parkades going through multiple directions. Once your inside your coordination misleads you to believe you know what direction your headed in. Once walked 30 minutes across the mall thinking I was heading SE, to only find it was on the other end.  It can be emotionally draining spending a day walking around, with the overwhelming stores to choose from, the pushy commissioned sales clerks and trying to find your way around the place.  The mall just finished a recent expansion and new wing to the mall.   My only advice is to go on-line and do research about the mall, figure out what you want, where to go and what store suits your needs. It helps to have a plan when going to Chinook."}
{"text":"Very big mall in Calgary. Lots of stores, choice is wide from high, expensive stores to cheap ones. Everyone should be able to find something suitable for him. There is also quite big food court. When you are in Calgary and want to do some shopping this place is worth visiting."}
{"text":"Best mall in Calgary. Great mix of stores, lots of parking."}
{"text":"This is a great mall. Lets just with just the parking,  I as a visitor to Calgary have been to this mall about a handful of times and have never had an issue with parking. My last visit I went into the underground parking and was amazed by how advanced, as a parking lot can be, this one was. Above each parking stall is a red or green light, and you guessed it, red means occupied and green vacant. Fantastic. A visual to help guide me through this place instead of randomly searching rows. There also were numerous attendants located within the area, they were even directing traffic. The mall itself looks brand new and modern, it really has ever store that you could possibly want and need. The food court itself is huge and again has a wide variety of \"eats\". The only issue is actually getting to the mall, the way the engineering group has the roads and metro the traffic can become brutal."}
{"text":"Meh... I use to love this mall. It use to seem so huge and full of everything I've ever wanted. Lately, I've been struggling to find the stuff I need when I go here. It's not that the stores have changed, it's more than it just doesn't seem to cater to the late-20-something-yyear old. I think it's a great mall for teenagers, rich people, and kids. And I'm not in that group...   For me, Market Mall and TD Square have this mall beat.   On the weekends, this place is packed. Parking is incredibly frustrating because of MacLeod Trail. The food court is just ok, doesn't have anything I'd really run for. There aren't very many healthy options, so I usually end up settling for a sandwich at Cultures.   The new extension of the mall is pretty fancy. It's got all the high end stores that I like to go into and pretend I'm rich. I never buy anything though. Talk about off the target market. The building itself is kind of outdated now...especially compared to TD's new redesign.  For me, Chinook is just ok."}
{"text":"It's alright the mall. There is 3 stores I absolutely love H & m and below the belt and urban outfitters and blue notes. Clean friendly and good sections.  Great movie theater IL add for a positive"}
{"text":"If you asked me what a good shopping mall should have I'd say: convenient location, ample parking, a wide variety of stores, good hours, walkability, entertainment venues, a solid food court, restaurants and of course washrooms in the right places. Does Chinook Centre have all this? Short answer: yes and then some! Full breakdown below:  1) Convenient location? Yup! Right on Macleod and Glenmore with the Chinook LRT located just a short walk away. Small secret, Route 506 is a free shuttle bus service to/from Chinook LRT/Chinook Centre for those who have trouble walking or just need a break. There are also dedicated Mayfair Taxi spots and Car2Go spots, so there are no shortage of options to get to/from Chinook Centre. Score: 5/5  2) Ample Parking? Yes and No, there are over 5,500 spots (most underground) making it Calgary's largest heated parkade. So yes there is ample parking, but the \"no\" for parking is because you have to know where to look. The front surface lot (East) and most immediate underground areas are typically poor choices. I recommend checking the rear (West) surface lots and underground, but avoid the Nordstrom area (used to be the spot when it was Sears, but busy since Nordstrom came in). Surface covered parkade can be hit and miss out back. Also the area by Shell and Nordstrom out front is usually a safe bet due to its awkward placement lol ;). They even do valet parking at this mall on weekends... lol. Not free like The Core though! You will have to pay. Score: 4/5  3) Store Variety? ABSOLUTELY! A little bit of everything, something for everyone and a range of price ranges from affordable to very high end. With over 250 stores there's really too many to list, check out the list online! Score: 5/5  4) Hours? 9:30am-9:00pm Mon-Sat, Sun/Holidays 11:00am-7:00pm, more than adequate! There are some exceptions on some anchors like Chapters, Shoppers and the Movie Theatre of course (check online). Score: 5/5  5) Walkability? Yup! The layout of this mall is pretty simple to navigate once you're familiar with it. You can even do it pretty strategically to cover both levels with minimal/no overlap if you know what path to take. Escalators and elevators are in the right places. It does get fairly crowded, but the walk ways are wide enough so you can get past the slow pokes. They even categorize the floor plan a bit, for example most cell phone stores are in the same area and most high end stores are in the same area. Score: 4.5/5  6) Entertainment? The best theatre in Calgary (see my separate review for why I think it's the best). There's a bowling alley as well at this mall! No other major activities though. Score 4/5  7) Food Court? Great balance, a little bit of everything from greasy to healthy, from super cheap to a bit more expensive. Sweet to Savoury... you get the point. Score 5/5  8) Restaurants? MMhmmm: JOEY Chinook, State & Main, Bazille, Double Zero Pizza, Boston Pizza, Globefish Japanese Bistro and Chop. Great options, just docking a point for variety, Score 4/5  9) Washrooms? These are so-so, they have them located throughout the mall but they're kind of in these odd spots away from everything and you find yourself rushing to them rather than conveniently using them. Score 3/5  Simply put: Chinook has something for everyone! Given my breakdown above you may be wondering why I gave it a 5/5 overall instead of a 3 or 4. This mall is a 5/5 because it's the best Calgary has to offer despite a couple short comings, if all the malls in Calgary were the exact same distance apart I would always choose Chinook Centre because it offers more overall. Market Mall, South Centre, The Core? No contest... Some might argue CrossIron Mills and it would be close because they have some strong anchors. But Chinook would still edge it out because CrossIron doesn't have the quality of theatre Chinook does nor does it have the restaurant options. So if you only get to visit 1 mall on your next major shopping day, choose Chinook Centre :)."}
{"text":"Best mall In Calgary! Lots of exclusive stores plus merry go round. Large food court and movie theatres. Bowling alley is 5 pin only.  No five star as portions of mall corridor are way to narrow from the 1980's"}
{"text":"I have a need/hate relationship with Chinook Centre. Despite all the reasons I don't like visiting, I find myself here about 6 times a year for various reasons. After the expansion, the selection of stores is phenomenal - if I need a variety of items (like for Christmas shopping) this is usually the place I end up (though I'll find a weekday to do the shopping instead of an evening or weekend). I love that there's a Phil & Seb in here and Victoria Secret was a great addition.   The minuses? It's extremely busy. Parking is generally non-existent and can be endlessly frustrating. I've had a bad experience with the new underground parkade (fire alarm pulled & it was 1.5 hours before I got out of the parkade, including firemen asking me to not idle when possible due to air quality issues) and it lets out onto Macleod Trail which is pretty inconvenient when traffic is heavy. All the parking lots are generally stuffed full of people during peak times and the 3-way stop in front of the mall off Macleod is a mess at the best of times. Don't bother turning into the mall from northbound Macleod, go the back way through 5th St.  All in all, I'll keep visiting Chinook but when I can head somewhere else I do that instead."}
{"text":"Chinook Centre is, for lack of a better phrase, a constant and consistent gong show.  Easily Calgary's busiest shopping centre (including the new one out in Balzac, as Chinook is still far more convenient for most Calgarians), visiting this place feels like entering a war zone.  It scares me a bit.  Chinook is big and filled to the brim with anything you need.  My personal favourite is Mexx, although truthfully I don't go there to buy anything.  I tend to save my money for the outlet stores, but their Mexx is a good size with great selection.  I absolutely love the theatre here, but avoid it on the weekends.  It is not designed to accommodate the massive amount of people who show up for new movies.  Going up the stairs is depressing, because you see the mess you're about to get yourself into.  But they partly make up for it with a Tim Hortons (timmies and a movie = awesome).  Chinook has the same flaw found in most malls that I absolutely hate.  The open space in the middle to look down or up to another level.  Aesthetically, it makes sense for a few reasons.  Functionally, it's a complete wast of space.  When the mall get's busy - which it does, often - the narrow room fills up quickly.  All malls should be designed without that void in the middle.  Compared to Market Mall or the new CrossIron Mills, it's like playing frogger on a busy day.  But, despite the frustrations found at most malls, Chinook is a great place to do some shopping."}
{"text":"Great mall. Nordstrom is a great addition. Really enjoyed our recent trip there. Good food court. Excellent atmosphere and great attitude of salespeople in stores. A must go, if u like high end stuff and have money to spend. Recommended."}
{"text":"My love hate relationship with Chinook Centre shifted to hate after battling it out for parking a few days ago. It was insane! I drove slooooooowwwwwlllly around the entire parking lot before scooping up a spot, only to fight the crowds in the mall to do some shopping.   Chinook is one massive rectangle which is giant pain in the ass when you want to visit two stores on opposite ends. It's great exercise but bad for time and stress levels. I do love the selection of stores, which is why I love Chinook. I love their tasty and open food court, which is a great place to catch a break, and the events. I love the movie theatre and bowling alley (although I wish they had a grocery store) and I can't wait until they finish renovations... They have all the big box stores in Calgary, a Zellers, Sears and a Bay, a Zara, a Lululemon, an Aritzia, a Rickies, tons of shoe stores, a FCUK, a Mac Store... I could shop forever and the new stuff is going to be tops.   But the parking. ARGH. Basically, if I visit Chinook it has to be a day trip to make the huge ordeal worth it. Chinook is great for shopping but badly designed for everything else. Unfortunately it also appears to be the main hub of activity for all of Calgary's High School population. No wonder it's so busy."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chinook centre for 10 years but it has been quite some time since my last visit!  I was really pleasantly surprised!   Abercrombie     Hollister        7 for all mankind   Kiels  Target  Williams Sonoma  Pottery Barn  This place has really been done up nicely!  I'm amazed at all the high end shops here now!    I walked by the food court and they really did a nice job of it!    This has to be on par with the Eaton's Centre in downtown Toronto, Carrefour Laval in Laval, QC and Vaughan Mills!   The underground parking would be sweet as well in winter!    Malls have sure come a long way in the last 20 years!  It's more about the experience and everything has gone more upscale!"}
{"text":"Chinook is a unique mall in that it offers medium to high end stores. I love that you can shop for almost anything here. The only downside is that it is not accommodating to young children. You cannot rent buggies and there is no free indoor playground. Underground parking is convenient and great. There are stalls for families with young kids so I guess that's a plus there. I just really love that there is Nordstrom there now! I tend to stay on the north end of the mall where all the specialty retail shops are like Tory Burch, Tiffany, Coach, Burberry, Stuart Weitzman, BCBG, Kiehl's, Seven for All Mankind, and Le Crueset. It's a huge mall so bring your walking shoes!!"}
{"text":"ugh, I hate it when I have to go to this mall.  Luckily, I only have to go maybe once every two years. Today was one of those unfortunate days. To start, parking sucks.  There are so few spots near doors, especially on the backside, and it's always so full. Second, this mall is always teeming with people. This is the #1 reason why I will not go there around any weekend or especially Christmas. Third, it seems that every overpriced store in the world is in this mall, selling impractical items for Hollywood prices. Fourth, everyone who seems to shop here and work here are pretentious. I'm not even exaggerating when I tell you that I was basically shoulder-checked by 3 people today and I was there for less than an hour.  I was practically plastered agaist the wall and apparently that still made me totally in the way of the weekday shoppers and so they felt it was their right to let me know that I don't fit in there with phyisical force. Lastly, I hate the layout of this mall - so spread out, weird offshoot hallways, few escalators, etc, etc. etc. Sorry to vent on ya, Chinook, but you will never be my go-mall. Not even top 10, and I don't even think we have that many malls in Calgary."}
{"text":"Meh, another wannabe Beverly Hills mall with high end stores that have very little interest for me."}
{"text":"I went to the new Chinook Centre opening last night and although I have been to hundreds of store inaugurations in my life, this one has to be by far the most glamourous and the most stupendous.  First thing that stood out for me was how amazing the organization was, the registration so easy, and parking was basically a breeze because of dozens of parking guides.  The red carpet leading to the entrance was actually the skirt of a chinook centre goddess who led you to the elevators.  You entered two floors of newly remodeled Chinook centre floors with over 14 kiosks of free alchohal and food.  We are talking all you can eat and an endless supply of personally shucked oysters, chicken and beef skewers, funky chinese to go boxes complete with fresh sushi and chopsticks.  There were miniature tacos and burgers and half a dozen desert tablesbrim  filled with dark chocolate, and truffles, and carrot cake  and and and.  Lets not forget the sleek goblets of champagne, red and white wine, hearty portions of scotch and scrumptious apple martinis.  I was reeling with all the options, when you saw a station next to empty it would be replemished in a bat of your eye.  The stores were bright and glistening and people were given beautiful red and white gift bags, brimming with chocalate and calvin klein undies.  If this opening is an indication of the new Chinook Centre, it will undoubtedly be a huge success with over 40 more new shopping locations. 5 stars"}
{"text":"I like this mall. Its nice inside. Lots of great store. Very spacious and airy to walk in. They have a huge parking lot. They also have one underground too. Just perfect and convenient. Also its close to downtown so that is a plus for someone like me who lives downtown.  Most people come here because of the theater. Its a Scotiabank theater so its bigger. Also the theater is newer and its great to come to this mall just to go to the theater.   They have some artwork to see inside. So that is plus."}
{"text":"The new renovations are great!  The new heated underground parking lot has tons of space if you ignore the faulty \"free spot\" indicators that aren't calibrated properly and they're getting great anchor businesses such as the Apple Store and Tiffany's.  This mall is family friendly and conveniently located if you live in the south."}
{"text":"Trendy, chic and adorable clothing... Purr has it all! This is a fantastic little shop on 17th that is every girls dream come true. There are so many fantastic dresses in this store I could just get lost in it. I spent a fair chunk of time wandering around this store lusting over dresses and inspecting the fabrics. This is a pretty busy store and the only disappointing thing was that there wasn't more change rooms, three is definitely not enough for this place. This place is filled with adorable fashion and I'm sure I could spend my entire pay cheque here! This is an all ladies fashion store with tons available for those of you who follow the trends - check this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was heading over to the Chapter's in Chinook Centre when I remembered that I hadn't checked out the new wing yet.  Coming down MacLeod Trail South, I spotted a new turn off, which I thought would lead me into the parking lot in front of the new wing.  Instead, it lead me straight down into the new North Parkade.  This was the start of my venture into the new wing.   The new wing is pretty swank.  The parking lot itself just smells new.  Its got high ceilings, it's well lit, and the little green and red lights above the stalls to tell you whether a spot is open or not actually work.  While I walked to the escalator, I even noticed some background music playing.  That's right, music in the parkade.  Featuring higher end stores that I'm used to seeing in Vegas rather than Calgary (think along the likes of Coach and Burberry), the new wing certainly sparkles in comparison to the Chinook I'm used to.    If you're worried about parking, go on a Tuesday evening like I did.  You shouldn't have any trouble finding a parking spot, and if you stop in the middle of the mall to look at all the shiny new sights, you won't have to worry about causing any collisions for the people behind you.  When I left, I followed the parkade through to the backside of the mall so I could head back downtown.  It linked up with the West Parkade before it let me surface.  There was a definite transition.  I felt like I was crossing over to the wrong side of the tracks.  The low ceilings, the dim lighting... the new and the old just don't quite match."}
{"text":"Review #27 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  Being the closest mall to my place, I like going to Chinook when I am in much need of retail therapy sessions.   What's to like: - lots of good shops - not that huge that it will tire you to talk from one end to the other - lots of parking spaces - good size food court  They can improve: - maybe add a few more restaurants - improve that main macleod vehicle entrance/exit where most of the time, drivers do not know who has right of way or who's supposed to yield/stop - add a few more restrooms - i dont know who's responsible for that escalator to the theatres but someone needs to fix it cos that's not working most of the time"}
{"text":"Chinook, Chinook, Chinook why you gotta be such a weekend gong show?! My gosh, from the moment you drive up (yah, drive up, not even parked) you can feel the eminent chaos that will ensue.   Once you find parking, (allot about 10-15 mins to find a spot or you can pay $11 for the valet service) you enter the largest mall in Calgary. I enjoy the selection of stores and restaurants. There are tons of cool stores like Nordstroms, Apple, Sephora and many, many, many others. So if you're looking for something in particular you're almost guaranteed to find it at Chinook.  But if you don't like the excessive crowds, the endless lines and the bustle of being contained in a building with 5,000 people do not go to Chinook, well on the weekends. During the weekdays, Chinook is probably one of my happy places in Calgary."}
{"text":"Why review a mall?? Because I can!   So since last year or so chinook has a fresh new wing! I call it the \"west wing\" hahaha... It's pretty sweet and makes the mall feel more complete. Though the majority of stores are clothing which does not interest me that much.Though certainly is enough here to make me want to come once in a blue moon. I definetly come here for Christmas shopping every year.   The food court here is quite good! A lot of seats as I rarely have trouble finding a seat, even during peak Christmas season. Another feature I really like is the new underground parking lot , when I get a ride here during winter I greatly appreciate avoiding the cold on those -20 days.   The bad?? The parking lot that tells you how many spaces are available is buggy and faulty. Droves of mall rats of course, myself included! And also the security are very snooty towards smokers like myself and apparently are banning smoking completely in 2012. Little do they know.... Anyway Me and one of the Calgary transit bus drivers think its ridiculous !!  It's a mall, it's a decent size and if I am their for more than 2 hours I loose my mind! End of this review....   15/30"}
{"text":"Probably the most popular mall in Calgary.  With a few exclusive stores like Nordstroms and the Lego Store, close proximity to the ctrain station and a fairly large food court, along with a variety of shopping destinations, you could see yourself spending both time and money here.  Depending on your shopping needs this is the mall to go (or avoid) during Christmas time.  There's a little bit for everyone.  There's even a merry-go-round in the food court for the kids ($4, $8 with picture)."}
{"text":"I liked this mall a lot! My bf brought me here and we went on a mini shopping spree! 5% tax at the mall for a Toronto girl is amazing! I heard that the mall is recently redone and it looked new and fabulous! I actually saw the mean girl from the bachelor canada behind me in line at AX lol random. I just love Alberta ppl, everyone is so nice even at a crazy packed mall! Wish there was a big Holts here tho! Good selection of stores overall and clean! :)"}
{"text":"The crappiest parking in the world. How much did chinook spend on their red/green parking stall light setup, to have an error rate of 80-90% wrong at the start, to utter failure in 3 years? The crazy tight windy underground parking absolutely sucks.  They had people directing for pedestrians, but they needed people for directing stalls. They have decent shops, but it's too big for it's own britches in terms of parking."}
{"text":"With all the renovations this mall has done recently in the past few  years i think it still rates the #1 Mall for the Calgary Area :D Personally i enjoy it because of Guess and the Movie Theater :D"}
{"text":"Review #22 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge  Pros: Large selection of shopping, lots of name brand stores, there's even a Victoria's Secret.  Movie and Imax theatres lots of parking Restaurants  Cons: TRAFFIC GETTING INTO THE MALL OFF GLENMORE IS INSANE!!!! It seems like no matter what time of day it is, it's totally freaking backed up with people trying to turn left and go into the mall.  And then Macleod gets backed up too. The most frustrating thing about this mall is trying to get in and out and get a parking spot. It's damn annoying.  The parkades don't all connect, sometimes it's confusing trying to get out of them. Also if you go to a late movie and went into P2 through the mall entrance they close it off, so you have to go outside into P1 and then walk up the ramp and then into P2 to get your car.   I just wish it wasn't so damn busy.  Why does everyone like Chinook so much? Why is it so busy? Does everyone live at the mall or something? It's crazy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite mall in Calgary... You can find almost everything you want and the prices are the same than everywhere else.. Additionally, it is very beautiful and have a nice ambience..."}
{"text":"The new wing is open and the stores in it are a welcomed addition. I used to work in the mall at Old Navy and seeing the transformations since then are great.  With so many stores that Calgary has been missing, it's hard to believe that it's taken this long to attract some of them with all the oil money floating around the city.  I'm glad to see that Cadillac Fairview was able to do it.  Sure the mall is crowded most of the time, but just like their marketing messages have been saying over the years: PARK IN THE BACK.  I've only had problems finding parking at this mall once, and that was on boxing day, which was a stupid idea to go to the mall anyway."}
{"text":"The new wing is nice, and adds a lot of great stores that are new to Calgary and/or Canada.  There's a great cafe in Phil and Sebastian's, as well as \"new\" stores such as Coach and Abercrombie & Fitch that will be intriguing to some.  The new parking lot is cool, with lights above each stall that indicate if it's open or occupied, lots of lighting to make it bright, and fans to keep the air circulating.  However, the stall status lights often don't work, which is uncool.  The food court is average, with a good assortment of foods that should allow almost anyone to find something to eat.  It loses points for the merry-go-round smack in the middle of the food court, which takes up space that could be used for seating and is generally annoying.  As Sapna mentioned, this mall is usually packed.  In November and December, it's a write-off.  I went in November and there were police helping direct traffic into and out of the mall.  The week before Christmas I can understand, but November?  Those police would be much better allocated trying to catch the guy trying to steal the stereo out of some guy's Escalade.  (Speaking of Escalades -- what ever happened to those spinner rims that were all the rage a few years ago?  Those sure died out quickly.  The worst were the fake \"spinner\" hub caps that cheap people put on their Honda Accords.  But I'm not judging.)  Chinook is definitely one of the best malls in the Calgary area, along with CrossIron Mills, Market Mall, and South Center (eww...that last one is actually not that good).  In fact, maybe Market Mall isn't that good either.  Even being so crowded, Chinook probably beats out CrossIron Mills as the best mall in Calgary (and area -- thanks Sapna) because of greater selection and a good coffee shop (P&S, mentioned above)."}
{"text":"As my flight to ORD was delayed, I took this as an opportunity to check out the Chinook Centre.  What's the saying?  When in Rome....  Anyway, first thing's first -  this mall is ginormous.  I was afraid that parking would be a nightmare, but it seemed to flow pretty well and I even scored a spot next to one of the elevators.  Win.  [However, I had to make sure I snapped a picture of the exact spot I was in as I was convinced that I would get lost and never be able to locate the rental car again.]  Store-wise, nothing really seemed to stand out to me. The selection of stores seemed pretty standard and a good mix of both high end and more affordable.  I think they have random attractions throughout the mall, like model airplanes or something?  The one thing that stood out as different than the US was HUGE food court.  Like, what.  Tons of Asian food, too - not just Panda express style stuff.  Yups. *sigh*  After quickly walking through one more side of the mall, I decided it was time to leave as I didn't want to risk missing my flight.  And, for those of you that care, I actually navigated my way back to the rental with no problems.  Yay to the Tory Burch store reference point."}
{"text":"Way to go, Chinook Centre, you have removed everything that made you interesting: the fabulous mosaic flooring in the centre court, the dinosaur statue, the carousel, the fanciful airplanes that circled above the food court. All of these were removed and replaced with . . . nothing. Empty space.   Now you are no different from every other mall in North America. That's sad, really sad."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I've been in the retail world for my entire career. And I still love it.  I had only been to Chinook Centre once before on a mall tour so I was excited when the Hubba Hubby suggested we hit up the mall to check out Nordstrom when we were in Calgary last weekend. And what a great experience from start for finish!  There's tons of parking and it's all well signed. We ended up in one of their many parkades and it was easy to find parking and then find our way into the mall. The mall itself was also really easy to find, at the corner of two main intersections that was well signed.  The two level mall has a ton of great stores - I wasn't specifically looking for anything so I couldn't tell you if they're missing anything obvious - but we loved the selection and the layout. Props to the mall for having a lot of way finding available - both with the handheld mall directory and maps, as well as the electronic versions.  The food court is expansive, both in selection as well as seats. The place was packed for a Saturday afternoon but we were able to find great seats next to a fireplace to enjoy some Thai Express. Really, anything that you were in the mood for can be accommodated in this food court!  Chinook Centre was clean, which was fantastic to see especially with so many people in the mall that day. And we just got good vibes from it - bright, airy, vibrant, comfortable."}
{"text":"Came up to Calgary to do some shopping with a favorable exchange rate.  Headed to the Chinook Centre to fill up the truck with goodies.  Nice upscale mall with all the things you would expect to find.  We roamed, we got lost, we got found, and we made purchases all the while.  Stores open at 11 Sunday.  Crowds are well established by 1.  Will be headed back on the next trip up."}
{"text":"I went to check out the Chinook Expansion today.  Parked in the North Parkade, in the basement of the new expansion building.  The parkade is very well lit and lots of aids to help you find your parking spot.  They have thought of everything, especially for handicapped parking spots, which are close to the entrance of the shopping centre.    The escalator took me to the main floor of the new expansion buidling where the fancy shops are.  It's like being in mini Las Vegas Premium Outlet Shops with all the designer and fancy stores like Burberry, Coach, Fossil etc.  I can see many shoppers buying expensive handbags and walking out of the store with their purchase.    It's nice and airy in here.  It's not so claustrophobic as CrossIron Mills, I find.  I think the rest of the mall may have to keep up with the new expansion side."}
{"text":"It's Calgary's version of Yorkdale Mall in Toronto.  It's big, has a bunch of decent stores and yes...for all you fruit lovers...it has an Apple Store. The three times I've been here, the whole car scene was nuts!  There was 9...yes NINE...9 security guards directing traffic at their main entrance.  Parking is a nightmare...right in the middle of the day and getting in and out of the place was no easy task. If you don't need to go there...don't.  I would avoid the whole mall rat race and go to the other malls around the area.  The same advice I give for Yorkdale!  Shopping should be fun not a punch to the CHINook!  Bwahaaha!  Couldn't resist. Cheers!"}
