{"text":"Northern Mexico food, at its best. Beans are homemade and good, have not got sick yet, so its been fresh. You do know, 9/10 times its bad beans, when you get sick, lol. They throw in some chips and salsa's to spoil your meal, buy hey, its up to you. Service is good and football (soccer in america) is always on, yeah. I do breakfast here sometimes and its the spot when I am hungry after work, so its a no miss for me. Posole and menudo too, not just on every other full moon when a democrat is president ;) They also have small bar in the back, but alcohol is not my thing so, who knows. Check it out, don't be scared."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but probably not any better than something I'd get at filibertos for cheaper. It just seemed to lack flavor. The service was okay and the food was served quick so otherwise no major problems."}
{"text":"With a move I took out here recently I had to stop to a little family owned local joint for some Mexican.  It's nothing incredibly fancy, but I enjoyed it.  The service was very attentive, and they can fill up pretty quick.  It sucks to see some of the bad reviews on here because I got an impression of a hard working staff.  The prices are also incredibly reasonable.  I plan on returning,"}
{"text":"Doesn't taste like authentic mexican food, nothing is spicy not even the hot sauce. Super cheap about everything, refills on drinks, chips & salsa, etc. Okay tasting food, but not flavorful at all."}
{"text":"If you don't want fancy,  this is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.  Shrimp and fish street tacos are amazing.  Love their salsa and green Chile. My husband went here as a child. Family owned for decades. Family and service is very friendly.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Susie's is my favorite Mexican restaurant I have ever been to.  The pesole is perfect.  The lengua tacos are delicious.  The enchiladas and rice and beans are unbeatable.  THE BEST Mexican food in town!"}
{"text":"Enjoy this place for lunch or happy hour.  Nothing fancy, just good prices and good food in a laid back environment."}
{"text":"Got Pazole two years in a row here to go.  Great job on the food, but shouldn't have to wait for an hour after I place my order to get someone to pour pre-prepared soup into to-go containers.  I was waiting in the front while several people came up to the front to complain about the service.  They are under staffed, but the food is really good. Call way ahead of time for take out, or be prepared to wait if you dine in."}
{"text":"Checked Susie's out today with Alexander C.  Perhaps I was too absorbed with the conversation that I didn't notice the food or maybe the food itself just wasn't that special.  Between the four of us we ordered a bit of everything.  The soft tacos with lengua, cabeza and pastor were solid - would've been better with more onions and cilantro.  The green corn tamale was bone dry - it was obvious even before I put it in my mouth - the corn husk looked like it had never seen a drop of water.  My guess is that instead of steaming it to heat it up, they had just baked it or even worse, nuked it.  The best dishes seemed to be the soups - Alex's posole had the right color to it and my albondigas contained some tasty pillowy-soft meatballs.  I don't think Susie's is any cheaper than most of the other Mexican joints I've been at.  In fact, El Nopalito's tacos are only 99cents.  Susie's tacos were $1.45 and up.  Mexican food is in general cheap (depending on how much decor you're willing to give up), so the deciding factor is in the taste which Susie's, unfortunately, did not especially shine at."}
{"text":"Always consistent. I've been going there for over 22 years. Green burro, enchilada style with green sauce is my favorite. Husband always gets Carne Asada street tacos which are okay/good. All served with rice and beans. They now charge extra for another order of their micro sized red plastic chip holder, which is funny and maddening at the same time. They have a mean mugger waitress that has worked their since forever and she's awesome, kind of rude but consistent. If you want more crappy tap water you're going to have to ask. Never smiles but great service. Will always love their ladder in the tree and front door. Total hole in the wall. Yum."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place for some authentic Mexican food while visiting family from Boston and was very happy with the experience. the building is old but clean. the staff was good and the food was great. we sampled a variety of dishes and I liked everything. wish we had something like this back home but there's nothing close. we will be back next time we are in town"}
{"text":"Susie's tastes like my Nana Lupe's cooking & she's an old lady from Pinos Altos, NM.     YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time never could I have imagined how good it would be . Best homemade food ever.just like my Nana .Service was good,  place was very clean. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Susie's is fantastic. The Albondigas Soup is out of this world. They serve a mild and hot salsa with a complimentary basket of chips - both are outstanding. The beef tacos and cheese enchiladas are very good. I'm a big fan of Susie's! They've been there for over 20 years so they're doing something right!!!"}
{"text":"If you are going to eat a burrito that isn't good for you anyway, I would choose Susie's. I love this place. The horchata is great. I like to utilize this place for a quick takeout burrito instead of a say.... burrito express. It is comparable to El Charro's, and it's really cheap. I call ahead and never wait."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall mexican food.  mexican coke in a bottle and decent food.  Ive heard if youre a gringo you may not want to head here on dollar beer night, but the staff has always been nice and its got huge portions on the cheap.  Its your typical shredded meats, beans and veggies but its way better than Filibertos but about the same price."}
{"text":"Roach alert:( I tried this place for the first time.  The food was pretty good and very well priced.  I was excited to know that I had found a decent Mexican restaurant close to me.   While enjoying my taco plate with rice and beans, I forked a roach out of my rice. We immediately stopped eating and called the waiter to our table.  She tried to offer me something else, but I couldn't stand the thought of my rice cooking and steaming with a roach.  We walked out and will never be back again.   Things happen, the place didn't look dirty.  I know roaches can be a pesky problem, but people shouldn't be finding roaches in their food.  I feel bad posting this, I mean no harm, but as someone who relies on these reviews when I decided on where to eat, I would want to know if I were you.  Anytime something like this happens, I feel obligated to let people know.   Hopefully they can resolve their roach issue, either way, I can't go back."}
{"text":"Everything was great today! My last review must have been an off day. Had some posole and menudo both were delicious! Enchiladas greet as usual. Just wish they gave bigger hot sauce cups."}
{"text":"Me and the Madre went here a couple of weeks ago looking for a good place to eat in Mesa... we happened upon Susie's. We entered through their crazy awesome door that was HUGE! and was seated quickly. the menu was okay looking, lots of pictures... that's kind of a turn off for me. blah. Menus with pictures *shudder* anyway, the food was drab and not worth the fuss. The decor was drap also and everything needed to be disenfected. or atleast hosed down. The wallpaper and the countless tiles are all from the 70s. I didn't hate this place, but I won't be back unless I'm promised a VERY strong margarita."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican food in all of Phoenix.  I don't know what they do to their refried beans but they taste like candy.  When I lived in Florida I used to dream about their burritos of carne asada.  Good people, awesome food."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Susie's since I was about 5. I used to live around the corner, so we would walk here... and every time, except for maybe a few, I order the same thing... bean and cheese burrito with beans and rice on the side and an horchata. I have had other stuff and I like it a lot, but this brings back great memories for me. I was there when they did renovations. I love when they have a mariachi band. It is definitely a hole in the wall and service is so bad... but it gives it character. PLUS there beans and cheese are like crack... so damn good. Come here with friends when you have the time to sit and chat for awhile..."}
{"text":"Been coming here off and on for over 30 years and it's still great a little mexican food restaurant. The sign out front still isn't lit at night so it's easy to drive by if you don't know where it's at. They've expanded to seat more people as the original only had a few tables. Only downfall is they charge for an extra bowl of chips. Might as well just order a nachos. Quick attentive service and decently priced."}
{"text":"I went to susies for the first time today for breakfast and I loved how authentic there food was the servers don't say much but they were still contantly refilling my drink and the food was so quick to come out , will come here again !"}
{"text":"Came here expecting authentic Mexican food... that's what I received. I mostly came here to get pazole, but everything else was delicious as well. Besides the pazole, we got a green chili burro enchilada style, chili rellano, a beef taco, and rice and beans. It was all literally amazing. Service was decent, atmosphere was acceptable, and they had Sol beer! 10/10 will probably go again tomorrow. Oh yeah, THEIR TORTILLAS ARE AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The only reason I go here is for the posole. The service is sub standard as the lady looks like she hates her job."}
{"text":"Susie's is great--not the best but friendly, dingy and tasty. They try hard to be better than they are, but the proof is in the food. It's good--a little rough around the edges, but good. Strange front door...but I like it when I'm in Aridzona. Not as good as SoCal Mexican, but better than Serrano's by a mile...and Macayo's too. Now, Jordan's on Central...that's the place! But if you're over in Mesa/Tempe, Susie's is a good choice. Aloha...."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch to give it a try again. .. last time I waited for 15 minutes in bar area with no service. ..soo  I just left...  This time... night and day difference. .. New waitress. . Been coming here for over 13 years.. never seen service like this ever.. attentive. . Prompt.. big smile.. food was served almost right away. . Was excellent lunch experience. .  Will definitely start coming here more often if service is more like today.."}
{"text":"brutal wait. 45 minutes for a burrito and taco. No chip refill while waiting, two people running around like headless chickens. horribly understaffed, ITS SATURDAY NIGHT!!!! We should have left but decided to wait it out. mistake. Sadly we won't be back."}
{"text":"{Actual Date of Visit: 12/1/11}  My visit started off rocky.  When I drove up, the outside of the place looked desolate and nondescript.  (Eyebrow raise).  Ummmm is that the door?  As I entered, I noticed the restaurant was really dark and not in a sexy-ambiance kind of way.  (\"Uh-oh\" I thought).  I approached the counter and received the side-eye for what I believed was my presentation of a Groupon for $10 of 20 worth of food.  \"Susie\" (I assume) examined my coupon for about a minute then said \"Ok\".   I was like, \"Sooooo, do i seat myself or...?\"  She answered, \"Have a seat, someone is coming.\"  I sat down and a waitress came to take my order.  After I ordered my food, the waitress came back to tell me the lunch special was excluded from the Groupon.  Fair enough.  So I had to start over again with not a lot of veggie options to choose from.    I got the two cheese enchilada which was good, not amazing, but definitely good enough to order 2 more to go to finish off my Groupon,lol.  I liked the rice that came along with it.  For desert, I ordered the sopapillas.  I didn't expect so many of them!  They taste kind of like a beignet or chinese donut.  Towards the end, \"Susie\" warmed up to me and told me about the student 10% discount and invited me back.  I may go back to check it out with friends, but I hesitate due to the lack of options for the vegetarian."}
{"text":"One fateful day after I moved to AZ, I \"stumbled\" upon this gem (we were specifically in search of Mexican, so I supposed it's not much of a stumble).   With delicious soft tacos, salsa, beans, amazing prices (3 carne asada tacos, rice, beans for around $6 with penny beers- say what!) and a familial feel, Suzie's soon became my go-to for Mexican. Their margaritas are from a mix, the beers on tap are nothing special and the meat does not follow my \"know where your meat comes from\" philosophy, but Suzie's definitely has a soft spot in my heart and stomach!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place with the boyfriend and we are craving Mexican food so we decided to go in . I had the number 13 which was two cheese enchilada with green chili sauce (has chunks of Mexican beef in the sauce) . It was rich and filling . I enjoyed it but the service was SUPER SLOW! We probably will come back but not unless we are in the area ."}
{"text":"I wanna give a five star, so I say five star for the food.  My happy margarita should have had a bit more tequila and the only thing I can complain about is the service, interpersonal skills go a long way.  I really love the authentic food and will come back again.  just make my marg. stronger ok."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice (hoping my first experience was just a bad fluke... but sadly it wasn't). The service at this place is HORRIBLE. My first visit, I told the waiter that this was my first time and he said \"that's nice\" and just walked away. It took forever to get drink refills, salsa for our chips, etc. The waiter just didn't care and treated us like we were inconveniencing his otherwise very lazy day (FYI, we were one of 3 tables in the entire place... it was pretty dead in there). The sad part is the food was actually pretty good, so we decided to give it another shot. The next time we went, the service level was just as bad even though we had a different server (a waitress this time). Asking for extra water, salsa, etc. seemed like such a chore for her... and she'd disappear into the kitchen for long periods of time, then come back with one little thing for one of the 3-4 tables of people (again, pretty dead in there) and would then disappear again... it really seemed like she was avoiding the customers. For such a small, dead place... you would think they would be trying to WOW their customers to drum up some new business, but no... they don't want you here. Customers are just a nuisance to them."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years.  A great place not extremely far from mi casa.  The Front Door is classic and makes it a place you'll never forget.  The refried beans are packed with lard and flavor.  The Star Deduction is for the Posole I've had on my last two visits.  The flavor is perfect, but it came out of the kitchen luke warm and about 95% hominy 5% meat.  I hate to complain but if you guys see this, take it to heart.  It's a very popular item in your restaurant.  Send it out hot and put more than two chunks of meat in it.  Hominy is pretty darn cheap last time I checked, ad some meat to it..."}
{"text":"Great green chile!   I love this place, it reminds me of so many super Mexican food restaurants that I used to go to when I grew up in the Tucson area.  Inexpensive and good."}
{"text":"I was looking for a decent Mexican food restaurant close to work and stumbled across Susie's. Similar in price to Filiberto's but the serving sizes weren't quite as big as Filiberto's is (that's fine with me; I actually prefer \"normal\" serving sizes.) Loved the soft tacos! Ate there while on lunch break so didn't get to try the 1 cent beer with lunch, but made me want to go back on a Saturday to check it out!"}
{"text":"This place has been great since a buddy took me here in 2001. Nothing like a chile relleno and a tall glass of orchata."}
{"text":"Oh dang.  Their chorizo Mexican pizza is to die for! Literally, you will die if you eat this due to the quart of greasy goodness that oozes out of the sausage onto the pizza.  Totally worth the cost of a funeral."}
{"text":"Small place with a Big Taste! I have been coming here for 25 years! The tastes exactly the same as it did 25 years ago as the place is still owned and operated by the same family. I've had about everything on the menu over the years and everything is good. Their cheese crisps are a must try appetizer as they are THE BEST in town! Not the type of place you would typically stop at as it is not fancy on the outside! However, if you do stop in you will not be disappointed. Great food at a good price. Service is good and place is clean and friendly. They use to have Mariachis on Friday nights. Not sure if they do that anymore."}
{"text":"Front door the size of my college dorm room and decor inside as old as the hills. But the food is great. A little hole in the wall that always comes through in taste. My girlfriend is addicted to the carnitas tacos. Tiny street vendor style things, she can't get enough of them.   I go for red chile and am always happy when I leave. Yeah it's not fancy, Yeah, it's never going to make it into Phoenix magazine. But it's good. period."}
{"text":"I love their Menudo & Pozole is always so good here! My favorite place for really good Mexican food in town. My fav is always the soups..... thanks Blanca for great food every time."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in the valley. Nothing Americanized everything authentic. Amazing rice and beans and their shrimp cocktail is so worth it. My husband loves their burrito with green chile. Hope they some day invest in remodeling or updating their space."}
{"text":"i looove susie's. first off, you order a coke and it comes in the bottle, just like in mexico. second, they have plenty of totally out of skew, no perception wall murals with disporportionate people, also just  like mexico. the food is good and cheap. in fact, they won best inexpensive mexican food in Get Out's eating and drinking awards"}
{"text":"Went there a while back for dinner. I was soooooo impressed with their red hot sauce. It was definately the best I've had at a mexican restaurant. Food was very authentic and traditional. Just the way I like it. I have absolutely no complaints, and have recommended them several times already. And you gotta love their lunch special with a beer for only a penny more! Totally awesome. Quite a find here in the east valley, where it's kind of difficult to locate a great mexican sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night.  It was a solid 3 star review.  Burritos were good, tacos fell apart because the shell was so crunchy when I bit into it.  Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.  Filibertos on Main and Dobson in Mesa is better."}
{"text":"This was highly-recommended by some friends who have been coming here since they were kids. The green chili carne was definitely 5-star ... right up there with the best I've ever had. Rice and beans good too, as well as chips and very good salsa.   My husband loves chicken chimichangas/pollo fundidios. So, he got that. He said it was ok, but he wasn't too impressed, as he would rather get his from Garcias or Someburros.   Daughter had bean burrito, and we shared a good cheese crisp.   Oh -- I had a margarita on the rocks. Decent price, but not a decent margarita. Too much like that fakey mix taste and was there any tequila in there? Not bad for the price; but I would just get water with lemon next time.   I'll want to go back to try other items, though I may have to order that green chile burro again .. so good."}
{"text":"Very good food. Traditional old time Mexican. One of my favorites is the number 12, chili relleno taco rice beans. The relleno is made properly. No chili just folded inside an omelette. It is actually stuffed breaded fried then baked in a wonderful sauce"}
{"text":"Granted it's been about 10 years since I came here last, sad to see that the food quality has depleted!  Charging for a second serving of chips or any salsa with entrees. Rice was dry as well as the tamale. Could've have just gotten some at the store and microwaved it myself. Apparently they also charge extra for water because they weren't refilled once during our meal. So disappointed that a landmark such as this has lot it's authentic value."}
{"text":"Suzie's has a lot of good Mexican food, like cheese crisps, tacos, enchiladas, and more. The service is sometimes slow but it is worth the wait. The Shrimp Javier is my favorite. I am a regular here, it's that good. The cheese enchiladas are  pretty good too. It's also kid-friendly which is nice. They also have cold beer, which is nice. Its not expensive, and that's nice too. Its a nice place to go to!!!"}
{"text":"Suzie's a great place for their lunch specials, they have good posole and beef tacos, and I remember they only cost like 6-7 bucks for lunch, throw in a 1 penny beer and you are ready to go back to the office a happy man.  Like someone else posted, you have to know what to expect.  Think a nice sit down Filibertos with bigger variety and a little more food.  and yup, the food's gonna be a little oily, but their salsa is nice and spicy :)  My buddy from El Paso loves this place cause he says the food is pretty authentic, like what his grandma would make when he is home."}
{"text":"I usually just come here for coffee.  What food I have had is just as it should be.  What I love is the friendliness of the waiters.  The music playing in the background just loud enough to hear.  It's upbeat and I feel good after I've been here.   This place is nice and affordable too...."}
{"text":"We order pickup from Susie's often. My bf is a fan of their fajita chicken (& they've always been super accommodating to his specific, custom burrito order) and I am a habitual bean, cheese, & rice burrito consumer. Their tortillas are delicious and their rice is great,  as well as the hot salsa and fresh chips that come with every order. We've also enjoyed their carnitas and quesidillas, also great. Our favorite reason to keep coming back is the horchata - A+++"}
{"text":"Susie's is my local \"go-to\" for some bomb Mexican grub. The place itself is pretty straight forward - low priced, clean, fast, busy and reliable.   I found it through Yelp when I moved to the area and after my first visit, the search for my local mexi-spot ended.  Burrito's are legit. Homemade tamales are AMAZING. Try and enjoy! GOOD FOOD is what I'm going for and they have it!!"}
{"text":"There were 5 of us. I did not really care for either Salsa. A waitress spilled drinks all over 2 in the party. No discount or offer of a free appetizer. The flour tortillas are amazing. I love the rice and beans. The staff could be a little friendlier."}
{"text":"Suzie's is a cool place if you set your expectations properly. The food is decent, not overly memorable but definitely good for the price. The service is always mediocre at best ... but consistent. The atmosphere is hole in the wall / old & crusty ... but that gives it character. I'm particularly fond of Friday night's when they have a mariachi band crammed in the corner playing. Don't go out of your way for this place, but if you're in the neighborhood it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"This review is for take out only.   I've lived near Susi's for nearly 5 years but never tried it. I ordered a simple take out meal and it was ready when I arrived, about 5 minutes later. The ladies that worked there were friendly and kind. My food was surprisingly delicious.   4 stars instead of 5 because the restraunt smelled strongly of cleaning products (which I guess is a good thing) but the scent was a bit overwhelming for me.  I'd go back for take out.. I'd probably not return to eat inside. Ambiance is simole but adequate.  Overall positive experience because the food and service we good!"}
{"text":"So Ive been chatting with MJ K. for a while now.. we both have certain alignments that we instantly could relate with one another.. tacos, eating and yelping!   So we decided to meet at Susie's Cafe for a bite and some chat action. Well this is one of those places.. decent Mexican food at decent prices. Now the problem with that is that there are loads of other places that taste better and are cheaper.. this leaves Susie's it's location value. I was amazed to see so many people coming and going from this place, seems very popular with the locals. Plus if you order a lunch special, 6.95 and up, you can add a draft beer for $.01! Now that's a real bargain!  The pozole was great! Nice thick pieces of meaty pork, nice sides too, though what's up with the lemons? Also order a red chile burro and a beef taco.. the taco came sitting on lettuce, hot food and lettuce, come on! Took one bite, yeah, not so much, oily and flavorless. Now onto the burrito, acceptable. Now I haven't had any decent red chile in some time so being acceptable is a pretty good thing!  Was the food enough to get me to come back.. not really, this visit was all about the conversations! I hoped this place would be better but it just wasn't. Am I saying I would go back, no, I would since they make a pretty mean bowl of posole.. I'm such a glutton for good soup!"}
{"text":"Nachos were really greasy - should have stuck with the chips and salsa - tortillas and green chile con carne were really good - pass on the margaritas - Ladies room under construction and didn't have a light - my search for amazing Mexican continues..."}
{"text":"Had dinner with family. Atmosphere was quaint, authentic Mexican. Small place. Good menu. I had a chicken Chimichanga. It was too big for me to finish. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. I he flan was excellent."}
{"text":"Very good Authentic Mexican food.  Delicious! I would describe the staff as \"Satisfactory\". I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Been here before numerous times and food has always been good, service has been mediocre. Today was pretty bad. My mom got there 5 minutes before and still was waiting for a server to come by. Once I got there took another 10 minutes to get coffee ordered. They were not busy by what I saw and we ended up canceling the food and just paying for coffee. Total time from when we ordered food to when we cancelled was 45 minutes. Not going back :/"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The service wasn't that great and my tacos were very greasy."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had.  Margarita seemed to have zero tequila in it.  Food was very mediocre."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in the valley. Staff is really friendly and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"90 percent of my complaint was door dashes fault, never ordering through them again, anyway when we finally got our cold food that was spilled everywhere in soggy went bags, my tamale was inedible. I'm Mexican so I know my tamales. The albondigas had 4 tiny meat balls that were raw and 99 percent Onions. no potatoes just a few carrot and broth. The tortilla was uncooked AND burnt at the same time, if you've ever cooked raw torts you know what I'm talking about. And the dessert was a sad excuse for flan. It was gritty and the caramel sauce had turns into a hard film. All the food was cold and the horchata was thick and warm. Susie's used to be delicious I grew up eating there but it has certainly changed and I will not be eating food from there again. I couldn't enjoy it so my food all went in the trash. Dining in may be a better experience hit or miss but do not order in, and do. It order through door dash either unless you want to wait 3 hours for your food with no explanation. If you do it's at your own risk."}
{"text":"Overall the services was good but couldn't shake this feeling that the staff was not very fond me. I had the 3 shrimp tacos they were pretty good to be honest. Other than that I was very polite to the waitress thanked them even they did not acknowledge me. Asked all around the table for refills but did not ask me once. Nice little place but rude staff. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot. Great place for huevos rancheros or my favorite, cheese enchilada with over-easy eggs."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place for a few years! They have amazing food, but the staff has always been rude, but I put up w it because of the great good. It is on the dirty side! I got some food to go last night and found a hair in my Mexican Pizza! I won't be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall best Mexican food in Tempe.  It's not fast food either.  Home cooked great portions.  We are regulars here.  It's fresh & full of authentic Mexican flavor.  (And we know Mexican food growing up near Mexicali). The chili Colorado was so tender and the red sauce was PERFECT.  Not too hot but you could still taste your food.  Yuuuummm"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Mesa!  We checked out this place on a whim and I am so glad we went in.  Susie's brought back memories from when I was a little girl and would help nanny make food while we waited for my dad to get home.  The refried beans are creamy, smooth and seasoned to perfection.  The tacos are on point and don't even get me started on the enchiladas..  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  Susie's food is great and has never disappointed.  I gave it four stars only because sometimes the servers leave empty drinks and you have to catch them to get a refill.  Other than that, this place is one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by friends of my fiances. We love trying new Mexican places.  We're almost not even friends any more after trying this place.   You either have not had authentic Mexican food before or your pallet is broken if you think this place is even remotely tasty. Absolutely no flavor whatsoever, completely, totally bland.   I have never been so disappointed, Taco Bell is more impressive.   Not to mention, my fiance was sick at both ends for 2 straight days after eating here. Luckily, we got different dishes and I didn't have that horrible experience.  We would never, ever go here again and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Servers were a bit busy and distracted. But the food was sooooo good. If you are expecting watered down strip mall Mexican food, this isn't your place. The traditional soups are really good. Chorizo has a great smokey pepper flavor. The Flan was also very authentic and traditional and best of all, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday night for dinner on a blind date and was impressed w/this little diamond in the rough! Be careful that you don't drive past it - their signage is not lit up at night and not very big and I flew right by it!   Yes, it's nothing too fancy/pretty, but the food is great and the customer service is fast and friendly. I had the cheese enchilada and beef tamale and couldn't finish it - it was pretty tasty! My date had the Shrimp Javier and said he always orders that and seemed content with the quality. We both had ice cold Pacificos and had a great evening.   I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Arizona for 18 years so that makes me more than qualified to judge a Mexican restaurant when I eat at one. Today for lunch co-workers and I decided to eat at Susie's Mexican Cafe. We had previously visited this place before about 2 years ago and found that hardly anything has changed.   Don't let appearances deceive you. The big red door is the only cool thing about the look and feel of this establishment. We were surprised when we entered and there was a line, but the line was full of people trying to pay. So we had to wait a while to be seated. When we sat down, I saw that the booth we were sitting in was held together by duct tape. Not a promising sign. Overall, the place was dirty. It needed a good power washing from top to bottom and I did not feel comfortable sitting there. However, after living here for such a long time I believe this is just par for the course for Mexican restaurants. Sad.   Everybody who went said the food was good but not great. Surprising given that their motto is \"A Great Mexican Food Place\". They should replace the menus and update them as they have been in circulation for over two years. I had three shredded beef tacos. I think I would have rather had Jack-In-The-Box monster tacos instead. The taquitos looked rather good. I'm sure some menu items are better than others, but haven't verified. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked like standard Mexican food that you'd get at Macayo's or some other Mexican joint.  The lunch specials were $6.75 with our choice of 1 cent draft beer or fountain soft drink. Since I didn't drink any alcohol for lunch you can trust my review isn't tainted. The menu explicitly stated there are no free refills on drinks. Also your first basket of chips was free, but after that they were $2.15 each.  They won't do substitutions on their lunch menu and  they won't split the check. However when you go to pay, you can pay separately. Same difference.   To sum it up it was a sub par experience at least for me. I wasn't impressed, but rather underwhelmed. If you want better Mexican food, I would try Pedro's Mexican Restaurant, Blanco Scottsdale, Cervantes Restaurant, or Carolina's Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Great chicken mole enchiladas. Slighty rude and aggressive roaming \"mariachi\"  guy that forces tips out of you. They have negro modelo even though it's not on the menu, so that's nice.   Don't really go here on my own anymore, usually have to be invited by family. Free food?  Sure!"}
{"text":"This woman called me a \"bitch\" in Spanish...my girlfriend told me because she's fluent. All I asked for was some extra sauce! That's it! She moaned groaned and called me a, \"bitch!\" Never went back and the food isn't even good...Mr. Mesquite has the best tacos over EVER HAD! They have a Scottsdale and Phoenix location. Go there, they won't call you a BITCH in Spanish...lowlifes!"}
{"text":"I must have driven by this place a million times and never noticed it.  A friend of mine has been going there for years and took me. They had a large selection of options and I was overwhelmed.  I settled on street tacos and  they tasted exactly like ones you get in Mexico. I didn't like that they charge for chips refills (2.25) and you get a small amount of salsa but the salsa is fresh"}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite Mexican restaurant in the area.  We have yet to find something we don't like.  Granted, only Bae gets creative and orders new things.  I can't get enough of the green chili con carne chimichanga.  For a while it was always dead, but recently they've had a decent crowd every time we've gone.  Our only complaint would be the salsa.  The mild is pretty watery.  But it is not bad enough to deter us from eating there almost every week.  HH has cheap margaritas and draft beers.  Plus they have breakfast all day so Bae can still get eggs when we sleep in on the weekends."}
{"text":"Let's stop playing around with the less than 5 stars. Lets just stop that  This place is ridiculously good....like RIDICULOUSLY! Fresh tortillas and green chili stew - done, just order it. And the prices - WOW! Beans are like my nana's! Like my nana's nana....posole - even better! Don't go here looking to order enchiladas or tostadas...I mean they're decent but that's not what makes this place a gem...."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, no-frills Mexican cuisine.  The vibe here is like you're eating Mexican food at a Mexican restaurant in AZ from the '80s, and it's definitely possible that all the decor hasn't changed much since the '80s.    I had a horchata and the chile relleno plate.  The horchata was nice- it was very creamy tasting and not too sweet, and they sprinkled some ground cinnamon on top for added flavor.  The chile relleno was quite good.  The breading was nice, and it was a good balance of chile to cheese.  The refried beans in the plate were also very tasty, but the rice was a little too crunchy for me."}
{"text":"If you are writing poor reviews you obviously have not eaten Susie's Chile Verde con Carne.   I dream about it.  And I grew up in New Mexico!  The best  bowl of green chili stew or even better the green enchiladas with melt-in-your-mouth beef anywhere in town.  #13...don't forget the sour cream.     So you with the 2 & 3 stars go back and try the green chili and watch your stars become shooting stars!  I've never tried anything else there.  Why would you when you've found green chili heaven? Man, just talking about it makes me drool.  I'm headed out the door.....Susie's here I come!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went to this place because when we drive by its always packed. This was to celebrate our anniversary. The outside and the looks of the building inside should have told me not to come here. I got food poisoning from the shredded beef. Will never go here again and I feel bad for all those people eating there. DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"I was hoping Suzie's would be a go to place for a Mexican breakfast. But after two tries I will look elsewhere. I gave it a 2nd try and had the Carne Asada breakfast $12+. I ordered with rice but it came served with bland cubed potatoes, typical refried beans, two eggs, tortillas and some small meat that was thin, unseasoned and tough. Honestly it was close to beef jerky without the seasoning. The table seemed bare, salt but no pepper or hot sauce. I decided not to ask for anything else as the wait people were not paying much attention to me anyway.   Considering the price, low quality of food and mediocre service I won't be going back. there's plenty of café's and restaurants in Tempe/Scottsdale. Why waste my time and money here?"}
{"text":"First, I came here with a coupon from one of those entertainment books my daughter's school sells.  Many items were excluded including the lunch specials and the menudo.  Apparently, to be truly Mexican you have to enjoy eating a cow's stomach in soup -- menudo.  So Eli M. and I vowed to return one day.  Ah, yes, I am not even a little Mexican, but suffer from a proclivity to try unusual foods others turn up their noses at.  Enter Groupon.  Having purchased a Groupon that excluded the lunch specials, but not the menudo, Eli M. and I, with some friends in tow, made our return.  I told Eli M. that menudo costing less than $7 seemed a little dubious given the extensive perpetuation process he described, but we didn't let a little thing like that deter us. As the menudo was cheaply priced, I also ordered a chorizo burrito a la carte.  I was trying to max out the Groupon, and soup, regardless of the contents, didn't seem that filling.  Eli M. doesn't eat much and was satisfied with just a medium sized bowl of menudo. In terms of taste however, he said that it was okay.  He said it was too greasy, which is what our friends also said of their food.  Moreover, they have Pepsi instead of Coke.  And the location is a bit out off the quick lunch radius.  So, it looks like Eli M. and I will max out at two visits to Susie's.  Thanks for the menudo."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place months ago. I just didn't have the opportunity to come here until now. I pulled into the parking lot and was surprised how nice the place was (because of the area I figured it may be somewhat ghetto lol) nice, older, well kept building. Service so far was nice and friendly. Smells good  :) I always have a hard time ordering at a Mexican restaurant, since I'm Mexican I've had it all and I usually end up eating the same thing lol. Well I decided to stray from that this time. That didn't make it an easy decision tho. I saw the same things I saw at every other Mexican place. I decided to look at the appetizers. I ordered Mexican Pizza, because it came with their house made chorizo on it. I wasn't sure if it would be enough to fill me up so I ordered the beef tostada. Well the Mexican Pizza was good sized and delicious. But I wanted to at least try the tostada while it was fresh. Both were really good. The pizza was awesome!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was delicious. We had the lunch special #1 and #10. I had the green burro, husband had the red burro. It was so good!! We tried the green corn tamale as well. We also had a bean tostado which was really good too. The only thing was there is no refill on drinks or the chips and salsa. They make you pay $2.25 for additional chips which is silly. Other than that we will ne back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"A small hole in the wall kind of place. Really good authentic Mexican food.  Very reasonable prices and good fast service.  I had the chicken mole and it was really good and flavorful."}
{"text":"Very good mexican food! I've been here multiples times, never disappoints.  I got the shrimp chimichanga, not only was it delicious, but it had SO MUCH SHRIMP!! Chips and salsa were also very good. They have two types of salsas, a spicy one and a chunky one. Both good, but my favorite was the chunky."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 20 years and the food is just as good today as it was the first time! Its hard to describe something as simple as beans being so good but that's just the beginning! Albondigas, chilli reyeno, the rice, its all the best!"}
{"text":"From the giant red door to the affordable food, what's not to like? It is not the best Mexican food ever by any means, but it is solid. I've been here many times, and it's always been consistent. It's also easy on the wallet. I came here after my ASU graduation with some family and friends, and the bill was about $80, even with two pitchers. And how can you turn down a PENNY beer at lunch?"}
{"text":"Had me a Machaca Chimichanga here yesterday. A little pricey but for the portion size received, it makes sense. Deliciousness."}
{"text":"I tip really well because I'm trying to be a \"regular\" as I live right across the street but no matter how much I try to be a great customer I still wait ridiculous amounts of time for anything and they're not busy it's super empty and I just can't get any respect or service and I won't go there anymore. Just super crappy service the food is not good enough to warrant service like that and they are not busy enough to have that excuse either."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Susie's for 10+ years. Food it good. Excellent beans. Yes, it's unbelievable that refried beans can get screwed up. Rice is okay. Tostadas and folded shreded beef tacos are tasty. Real fried tortillas not processed Taco Bell style. Salsa isnt bad. Chips are hit and miss. Sometimes fresh other times not so much. Enchilladas aren't bad.  Service over the years has consistently sucked! Starts with the hostess (the one that gives/takes the check/payment). Absolutley no personaltiy and sets the tone for the restaurant. She is who you see upon entry and exit. I assume she is related, that's why she's still there.   Waiters are not much better. You will have to beg to get a refill because they only refill if you ask. Same with the chips and salsa. The salsa comes in a very small bowl no matter how big your party is.  It is dark and dingy but that's part of the appeal. Bathroom leave much to be desired. Unfortunately, I keep going back because the food is good... that is until I find another place."}
{"text":"We were craving great Mexican food and definitely got the best here!!  Very good service too!  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a good little family Mexican restaurant. They had a Spanish radio station on in the background, the waitresses are friendly, low prices and the portions are big for the price. The atmosphere is very casual so if you're looking for a fancy place this is not it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the parking lot was packed so we thought it was going to be really good! Looked around and there were a lot of Hispanics and then thought, this place will be fantastic! Well I don't know if they feed white people different food but the food we got had absolutely NO SPICE! It was like eating TOFU.  The chips were cold and broken up scraps except for the few on top and they came with tiny cups of salsa that also had NO SPICE.  You get one basket of chips and salsa per table or pay for more.  Disappointing!  We ordered a cheese crisp with green chili and what we got was crispy and cheesy but expected fresh ROASTED green chili's but instead got blanched green bell pepper.  NO SPICE!  I have never had a green chili that had no spice.  Super disappointing!    I had the #1 and the taco was actually pretty good.  I don't like a lot of meat in my taco's so it was nice to have more lettuce and cheese.  Just how I like it.  The salsa, however, had no flavor so I asked if they had anything hotter so they did bring out a tiny cup that still wasn't hot enough for me and could barely tell it was different from what they had already given us.  The green chili burro wasn't spicy either and the meat was too chewy.    My husband had the #10 and he liked his taco's. He said nothing great but OK but said it would have been a lot better with some spicy salsa.  The beans and rice were just OK nothing special to him.  My daughter had the Tamale with rice and beans and she didn't like any of it because she said it tasted like nothing.  No spice.   Anyway, I told her to add some salsa and she said it helped a little but still not worth having to burn off calories to eat something she didn't really enjoy. Same complaint from all of us Gringo's,  LOL!!  I went to the bathroom and got totally grossed out!  They have a toilet in the open area but no lock on the door so I opted for the toilet in the stall.  Went in, and found vomit in the toilet so I tried to flush it down but it would not flush down so I just walked out. So disgusting!!  The service was good except when it came time to pay the bill. Super slow to get out of there.  I would not go back.  I would recommend for snowbirds or anyone that doesn't like spicy food to go here.  It appears there are a lot of people that like this place but it isn't for me. Tempe needs some more spice when it comes to Mexican food. Really not many choices so maybe that is why this place was packed with people?  I don't know."}
{"text":"We waited about 30-40 mins to be seated. Once seated we waited very long for our drinks and the waitresses were not friendly Day just trying to get us in and out I can see why it's a busy Sunday but it would have been nice if they were at least friendly. We waited about 45mins if not longer for our food and it was all cold it was disappointing. We will not be visiting again"}
{"text":"The tacos here are awesome.. but what is amazing here is their sopapilla's!!!! I always get my food to go it's always ready on time and the staff is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"My 1st time here to eat and I have to say.  This was probably the best mexican food place I have ever been too. We had the Mexican nachos for an appetizer and we finished those with no problem. We each had a combo with rice and beans. My GF had a green chili burrito and a taco and I had the milanesa which was cooked to perfection. We didn't think We could finish everything but by the end not plates were wiped clean. The beer is cheap and they have delicious margaritas!!! We will definitely be back again and again. I base a good Mexican restaurant on the people eating in the restaurant and they had a place full of Mexicans and white people. And they do not cater to the white people like other chain Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Tempe. Good people. Good food. You can order large quantities of rice and beans to re-heat throughout the week-if you're a busy student."}
{"text":"Love this place for there posole!!! I get it at least once a week! Just quick tip if you do order things to go call way ahead of time because it does sometimes take a few to get the food. But I have tried posole at many places and this is the only place I will ever go!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap beer happy hour. Good Mexican food. Great Service  1 free chips and salsa basket per table. Yummy"}
{"text":"If you blink you might miss this unassuming little place... and that would be tragic.   A large group of us stopped by after baseball this week... and everyone left happy.  Carnitas plate was outstanding,  the shrimp cocktail huge and fresh,  posole like your grandma would make, cold beers.   The only weak spot was the guacamole... but with the price of avocados right now I'm not surprised they seemed to be offering a creamy dip rather than a chunky side dish."}
