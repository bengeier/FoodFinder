{"text":"Went for dinner to try their carved turkey.  They were out,  was going to take about a half hour.  No problem.  Then a half hour turned to a two hours.  Threw was no white meat fried or baked chicken.  They were out of plates, ice, cups and silverware most of that time.  It's like they didn't know how to manage with a full house.  What we were able to eat was okay.  The turkey was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This buffet has something for everyone.  Not the top quality that you would get if you paid much more, but for the money, you get lots of choices and can have a little of this and a little of that.  We particularly enjoy the Sunday (and Saturday) Brunch.  It is a good value, and everyone can get what it is that they are in the mood for.  There are so many things to choose from, we end up there often because it is such a good value.  If we want to eat at a fancier restaurant and pay 2-3 times as much, then we do.  But if we are just hungry, can't beat the value and choices.  We have been going there for 10-12 years and keep going back.  It seems to be much more crowded on the weekends.  If you want quiet, it is less busy during the week for lunch.  And yes, for those seniors, you save a little on the Sr Buffet for Lunch and between 1-3 that also includes the Beverages (the Hot Chocolate is great)"}
{"text":"OK so its an Old Country Buffet.  That pretty much sums it up.  Never been to OCB?  How about Golden Corral?   The food comes from a food service and is heated back up... how else could they serve so much for so little?  You can get a pretty good bang for your buck here.  TIP - sign up for their emails, and you'll get some BOGO coupons.  We go here a few times a year when we feel like being fat and eating nasty food, its a guilty pleasure.  Really what we go for is the entertainment.  Trust me - you will be the skinniest person in sight.  There's always something fun to keep you entertained, last time there was a woman (mother?) who kept putting her hands up her (7ish year old?) daughter's shirt, and down her skirt.  Something was probably up.  The time before that, the hippo family (really just the mom and dad) kept burping as loud as they could throughout the meal.  It must have been a contest.  OK, food:  They usually have a guy at the grill cooking steaks.  Not bad steak for a buffet.  Pot roast is usually a safe bet, as is baked chicken.  They have all the usual canned, salty veggies as well as a lackluster taco bar, average salad bar, and enough desserts to keep the kids screaming.  Unfortunately they lack what every good buffet should have - good, fresh rolls/biscuits.  Don't bother.    Service: Pretty good, they come by pretty often to clear dirty plates and offer drink refills.  Overall the servers are probably a lot happier than they should be for working here, but just as well that way.  Should you eat here?  Of course!  Go on a night you feel like gorging/heading for a heart attack.  After a glance around the dining room you'll feel a lot better about your figure!"}
{"text":"When coming up for a Sunday breakfast, the cashier stalled for time, making excuses as to why she couldn't ring us up yet. After 11 am ticked on the clock, she finally conceded and allowed us to pay. By that time, the \"Dinner\" prices replaced \"Breakfast\" prices, increasing by almost $4.00 a person, bringing our bill up by over $24 more than had she simply rang us up.  When I got to the drinks bar, there were no coffee mugs whatsoever. I called an attendant and they immediately brought some from the back, but when I picked one up to use, I found old drink residue left within, along with lipstick marks. My next two cups fared the same.   Finally, they replaced the cups with clean ones, but when I reached the coffee machines, they were all empty. FOUR COFFEE BREWERS IN A BUFFET WERE EMPTY.  So, I went over to the iced tea brewers, and poured myself a glass. To my surprise, i found coffee mixed with the tea! When I told the manager of all my troubles, he assured me I must be mistaken. I poured out my cup and showed him the bottom where both coffee grounds and tea leaves could be found, to which he scoffed and said I must have mixed them myself. He called me a liar in front of my own family!   After I calmed down, I went to get another plate of food and found there were no forks left in the holding cups, just spoons and knives. I figured it was understandable, since the place was a bit packed. The same manager was there, refilling the plate trays, and I addressed my concern. He went on a short rant about how they were full that day and couldn't keep up, it was hard to focus on any one task needed, and he'd send somebody over later on. I said okay and thanked him, to where he made an unnecessary  reply of \"Would you like to file ANOTHER complaint, sir?\"    I left broke, angry, and very displeased."}
{"text":"I didn't come here for 5 star food or service. I knew before steeping through the door it wasn't going to be like a Steak 44. If you don't feel like cooking and don't know what to eat, and just want food and you want somewhat of a dining experience, come here. The food is food and the service is decent. Fairly clean from what I can see. Ehh I'll take it. Cheerio"}
{"text":"Had a buy one get one free coupon and still felt like I paid way too much. Prices are not family friendly. Food is tasteless. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'll come here and pay the full price for one plate I fried chicken. But since it's a buffet, I might as well help myself to more..."}
{"text":"One star is to much. Came to breakfast. Food looked like it had been there for hours. It was taste less and dry. It is real hard to mess up breakfast, but they did a great job"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. Normally when I'm in the mood for an extended salad bar along with a couple other options I hit Golden Corral. This place just happened to be closer. Some items were good, some not so much. Some items were fresh while others weren't. My advice would depend on how much time you have to eat and your budget. If you want a quick meal at an affordable price it's ok."}
{"text":"My granddaughter just loves coming here.  The staff is nice and friendly the food is good.  The beverage selection has everything you could want from milk to coffee."}
{"text":"i like old country alot. the selection and quality is better then most other buffets in their category.  for dessert lovers, they offer a much bigger selection. i don't eat anything with sugar, and this is one of the few buffets that offers any kind of sugar free dessert. hometown does not. this place is much better then hometown in all ways. however, old country is not open during the week for breakfast. they have  nice dinner items such as cooked to order steaks, roast beef, shrimp, and alot of other choices. pricing is fair."}
{"text":"I was there on my birthday June 30th with a friend of mine and we both got sick! Food poisoning! And when I tried to contact manager he never got back to me. I left a few messages an nothing! Never Again Going here!"}
{"text":"Disgusting!  Very dirty and certainly not  worth the money.   Wish I could erase the experience from my head."}
{"text":"Too many seats, so little food! Not a lot of options but what's there is really good. -Pros: the drink station, you can choose from soda, coffee (different kinds) and icee, the desserts and salads are also good Cons- the booths ae to small, and it gets a little crowded at times  But overall not that bad"}
{"text":"I am going to be brief as I possibly can. 1) Food is horrible. Several years ago it was descent. 2) Buffet tables are not kept clean and all too often dirty dishes and silverware are mixed in with the supposed clean dishes. 3) Management is indifferent. They only will act when they are pressed concerning an issue. 4) THE SERVERS ARE OUTSTANDING. This has been the only consistent trait of the Buffet."}
{"text":"We just finished eating here. We went at 6:45pm on Saturday 11/30/13. We paid went inside and found a seat. All was fine until we went up to get some food to start our feast.     To our disappointment there was really nothing to choose from. 2 slices of pepperoni pizza, a taco bar, a full salad bar, a couple pieces of meat loaf and some old fried chicken. They were not busy when we arrived either and there were just a few people dining at the time.    They call themselves the Old Country Buffet but, nothing country about it. Mashed potatoes were instant, no fried okra, no bbq the list goes on. Everything they had was old and cold sitting in the window for who knows how long? We were there for an hour and the only thing that came out fresh was a pan of orange chicken. That whole pan of fresh orange chicken was then taken  by the family at the table in front of ours. Yes, literally the entire pan of it. The staff that pick up your old plates were very friendly though.       We will never eat here again due to lack of selection and poor food quality. It was a rip off at $42.39 for 2 adults and 2 children. Very disappointed in the selection of menu items! We will be way better off going to the Golden Corral from now on. The Golden Corral has a much better selection of menu items to choose from! I hope this helps if your like us and are in a toss up between the two resturants. In my opinion the Old Country Buffet on Metro Parkway is by far the worst buffet we've ate at thus far in the Valley!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting and poorly managed. I purchased a meal and then went to the restroom before getting food. The restroom reeked and had filth that was weeks, if not months, old.   I went right back up to the counter and asked to speak to the manager, who was sitting at a table eating. I told him I wanted a refund because I would be taking my business elsewhere: the bathrooms were disgusting, and if the bathrooms were that bad, I couldn't imagine how bad the kitchen must be! Without a word, he refunded my money with no apology, no promise to check out the problem, nothing. Terrible!   I have worked in food service and I know how difficult it can be to keep up on everything, and I know everyone has off-days, but the type of filth I saw and smelled was the kind that were indicative of an ongoing problem. It takes a lot for me to walk out of a restaurant, but I seriously did not feel comfortable eating there after what I saw. Don't go there unless you see a sign that says \"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT\"!!"}
{"text":"On April 18, 2011 my girlfriend Kiley and I went to Old Country Buffet.  As we walked in through the tightly enclosed doors there was a line of old people waiting on the side and the front line girl called us to the front of the line.  Kiley got water and I got a soda.  The price came out to about $17.00 for the two of us.  We walked through the totally what seemed to be unorganized restaurant where the only thing that seemed right was there was food on the left and tables, mostly dirty tables, on the right.   We found a table in a quieter section as we passed through a storm of kids that I wondered why they weren't in school as it was a Monday at noon.  We sat down and kinda soaked in the atmosphere for about five minutes thinking the server would come up but after about seven minutes I told Kiley to go ahead and get some food first.  She got mashed potatoes, part of a baked potato, carrots, a corn dog, and some chili.  She said the chili was good and the mashed potatoes were real mashed potatoes, but the carrots were plain and she did not finish the corn dog.   I got a salad, which had been sitting for a while,  BBQ chicken which was pretty good, carrots which I to thought were plain, pasta which I really enjoyed, rice and eggs which I didn't care for, and a chicken noodle soup which could've used some seasoning.  The server finally approached not even asking if we've been here or telling us his name and walked away before I could ask him a question.  There were no napkins on the table so I had to get up and find them.  Overall I guess I would say it was pretty good for a buffet but there was a very small selection and the salad bar had a ceaser salad and that's about it.  A lady approached our table and asked if we wanted to try some crab jalapeno peppers and I took one.  I wish they would've had them on the food bar because I could've had like ten of them.  None of the food on the bar went empty so I would say the cooks did a great job.  Most the hot food was hot except the fish.  Overall I was a little disappointed.  Would I go again? Yea but probably for dinner I hear they have steak and I'd like to give it a try."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years. Got stuck waiting for car repairs and decided to try them again. They were all right before but man has the food gotten awful! There's stuff on the serving line right now that looks like it's been sitting out for at least 2 hours. Dried out things, mushy things, things with skins that didn't start that way... It's scary.  The maple glazed carrots I got have the flavor and consistency of gelatinous water. The chicken bleeds grease. The cucumbers taste distinctly of veggie rot. The mashed potatoes - which have never been stellar but were at least edible - are now puddles of bland paste that drips off the serving spoon.  I hate to waste money by not finishing what I paid for but I really am afraid some of this stuff might make me sick. I won't be coming back. The only thing that kept this review from being a 1 star is the fact that the servers I met were very nice.   Scary food though."}
{"text":"I think this location is great. The management is really nice, the place is clean and the food is OK. However, i think corps policy on there being no lids for kids drinks is ridiculous. I have a 3 and 2 year old and they always spill their drinks every time we are there. As such we don't go much anymore. Kind of annoying. The reason why they don't provide lids is because they want you to pay for a to-go cup, even thought you just paid for a drink for your kinds."}
{"text":"Our latest visit was on Mother's Day and I was impressed that they were keeping up with clearing plates and re-filling food even though it was so crowded.  There was a big variety of food, even enchiladas.  It's a bit pricey usually and even more so on holidays, but well worth it when you have a growing kid!"}
{"text":"Food....this is one of many bland buffets in the valley. I always leave asking myself why did we come here. The kids enjoy it but they focus on the desserts. Golden Corral is definitely leaps and bounds above OCB in terms of taste.  Ambiance....has that cafeteria feel to it but there is plenty of room. Not the cleanest place but with the traffic they have I guess it passes.  Staff....always have friendly wait staff.  Verdict....if you are famished and nearby, I guess."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner as I didn't want to cook or order off a menu and have to wait for my meal.  It's fine for what it is.  Staff was pleasant and the place was clean.  I enjoyed the food that I selected from the buffet.  Yes, it is straightforward and simple food but most people know that going into a place like this."}
{"text":"I was so DISAPPOINTED!! I haven't been there for awhile but I convince my family who came from out of town to eat here saying there food was great and the price was good. It was a Friday night I'm thinking it would have been packed like it was before but I notice the parking was not full hmmm...so we walked in and I looked around and it was not busy and it was about 7pm. I notice the price when up $13+ but I figure eh no biggie.  So we went to grab our food and the first thing I usually grab was there steak, umm they don't make steak?? They had roast beef instead umm okay :/ so they usually make great pot roast, what no pot roast either?? The food looked pathetic on the buffet lines, the labels for food on the top didn't even match the food wtf??? I walked over to grab some rice and it was low and I saw the worker bringing more rice, so I was like great right? He dumped it in and mixed the rice that has been in there for awhile which I don't have a problem but the old rice in there was freaking crunchy like old stale rice!! I was embarrassed because my family was not impress! The only good thing came out of this was there dessert, well except the yogurt ice cream! What happen to the real ice cream that was there before?? The waitress said, \"how's everything\"? and I said, what happened here it was good before? She just apologized and didn't want to say to much but you could tell she knew a lot of customers wasn't that happy. I will never eat here again unless they bring the food quality back like it was before! Do the business not know they are declining? Hopefully you are reading this OCB and do something about it! Your losing customers! You use to be great what happened!! I just hope Golden Corral don't let me down tonight because that's where I'm taking my family this time."}
{"text":"I love Old Country Buffet....usually. The metro center restaurant is not one I love. In fact it frightens me. On a consistent basic this restaurant fails its health inspection. The food isn't kept at the right temperature and employees are not washing their hands. It's a haven for food poisoning. They've got to clean it up. Before someone dies."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service. GREAT prices. The lady who's job is to just take the dirty plates and cups offera Tapatio or Tabasco hot sauce. She will here and there eventually also ask if we needed anything. Not just our table, pretty much all the tables. She earned a $10 tip from me. Definitely coming again due to service."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.food was not fit for human consumption.super gross.fried chicken tasted sour .hope I don't get sick.save your money!"}
{"text":"Bad service!!! The girl upfront was an idiot the ice cream machine broken no ice and no cherry coke! The food is bla and it took the server 29 minutes to pick up out plates! Horrible horrible horrible! Never again"}
{"text":"Reminds me home town buffet, kids love the milk and slushy machine, and what all you can eat place really allows you to grab your own drinks these days. Love the food and the desserts with awesome costumer service and a wounderful waitress. Thank you for an awesome restraunt experience.."}
{"text":"The food isn't all that great and the Mac n cheese taste like that cheap powder cheese and the staff act like they where scared to come serve us maybe because of our skin color. The place wasn't very impressive I won't be back. I tried it once that's it."}
{"text":"Cheap and good for when you don't want to cook....roast beef was tender and veggies fresh....I will go again"}
{"text":"Food is ok need more meat then 3 different Kinds of chicken. The salad bar is ok tomatoes are green.  Been sitting here for 10 minutes and not one server has came over.  The Mac cheese is not blue ribbon."}
{"text":"We are from Pinetop Arizona and we were looking somewhere to  have to dinner and we decide to stop in old country buffet we are drive of 7:30 PM and the first thing that the girl told us on the front desk we close at 8:30 so would you like to stay the buffet starts at $13.49 wrong decision that rice was like gum knocking have taste I think it was in better off to go to Circle K and get a hotdog with better taste in so much cheaper so if you looking to stop in this place don't waste your time and your money find somewhere else cheaper and much better"}
{"text":"Food was great! The prices are reasonable. The servers were wonderful! What wasn't so wonderful is the person they have managing. The manager on duty today 5/27/16 Bill is a complete arrogant human! This person who is suppose to be a manager of a business was openly having a conversation with one his servers about Memorial Day (it being memorial weekend) the server asked what it means in our country, Bill, not so quietly rumbled on about how Memorial Day is a day where\" we Americans go to the lake and get hammered and relax on our day off.\"  I guess if anyone wants to know what Memorial Day is really about, grab a chair and sit next to Bill for a good ol Memorial Day explanation! How disrespectful! How arrogant! Most of all how pathetic can you be to allow those words come out of your mouth ?!  With that being said, my family and I didn't even finish our meal & left! Never coming back again if this place is managed by an ungrateful disgusting human being!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner . When we arrived the lady at the front counter was very nice but was very slow and a long line formed behind us . After we paid and got a table we started to check out the food . The food was slim pickings as there was not much out there . We got some food sat down and ate. We were not thrilled . The food was dry and cold . So we went back and looked there but was nothing that we wanted . We took a look at the desserts that looked like they were supposed to be cold but the cheese cake and pudding was warm and did not seem fresh . More food was out and it was better . The meat was not as dry the rolls were warm not cold and the Mac and cheese was hot . We sat at the table for a bit and relaxed and we both started to get sick so we headed home . We both ended up getting very sick from eating there . I would not recommend going there ."}
{"text":"I've been occasioning this location since I moved to Phoenix back in 2001 and thought (since asked by the CEO) I owed them a quick review. I agree with many others that the place could use a facelift. It is located in a strip mall that needs updating by the property manager (not the fault of OCB though). Other than that the food at this location is better than average in comparison with other buffets around the valley (including other OCB locations). I've only been here for dinner so cannot comment about breakfast or lunch but I have no complaints about dinner other than I think it would be nice if there was a lower price option for seniors (65+). It should be more like half price for seniors because they generally just cannot eat that much and it seems a little steep to charge almost $15 for dinner and a drink. If it were up to me to make a change for the better and allow for a more affordable dining experience for seniors I would set the price for a senior dinner at no higher than $8.99 and it should include the drink (in other words keep it under $10 out the door). I have a friend that goes with my wife and I and he complained about the price the last time we went (just a few days ago). I agree with him and think OCB just really needs to be more \"senior-friendly\" versus kid/family-friendly and even more so here in the valley where there are more seniors than in most other areas of the country..."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here because I saw that it was under the same company as Ryan's, a restaurant I've loved for many years. Unfortunately, Old Country Buffet did not live up to my expectations. The food was  selection was limited. Overall, everything tasted okay, nothing special. During dessert I noticed a hair in my carrot cake. For that reason, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We had not been here for a year+ or so, and things have improved greatly. Everything that I tried was pretty good, except for some Asian styled chicken bits that was old and very tough. Probably reheated too many times.  The staff is, as always, friendly and helpful.   We stopped for dinner, then came back for lunch a week later. Dinner offerings were a little more upscale, but lunch was acceptable as well. Everything but the previously mentioned chicken chunks was fresh and tasty.   The variety seems endless. We'll be back."}
{"text":"went here for dinner and it was HORRIABLE. they had no meat really that only thing was some roast beef that was extremely hard, the taco salad and taco shells were stale, the featured dessert was hard; there was only one waiter working for the whole place. Very disappointed we all felt very ill after leaving. we don't be returning. Cost way TOOO much"}
{"text":"You know I generally don't have the highest expectations when it comes to buffets as it is,  but this place didn't even come close to meeting those low expectations.  The food tasted bland and gave me chilling flashbacks of junior high school cafeteria food.  And I complained about paying the dollar or so for that,  so you can imagine my disappointment at what value I felt I got for the prices here.  The atmosphere here also is in dire need of updating.  I feel like I am 6 years old again and stuck visiting an old friend of my grandparents.  A little updating and you would get the feel of a place you want to be at,  not a bad memory of a old stuffy place your grandmother took you too.  They say location makes a restaurant.   If this was the case this place would be amazing,  because it's location by the mall makes it a great spot to get a bite to eat.  But with food and atmosphere so bad you leave disappointed vowing to never return.   Hopefully some changes could be made,  because I do feel like this could be a way better place.  But it all boils down to does this chain want to invest in making your experience a better one or are they satisfied making you leave with dreadful memories of junior high."}
{"text":"Always love the prime rib and ham . American style food choice. Staff is pleasant. Not over done on food choice so quality is better than most."}
{"text":"Missed the mark.  The food was mediocre at best, the staff was nice although I could hear the manager snapping at the staff.  I will not return"}
{"text":"We normally go to the southern location and have a great experience there. This time we went to the Stapley location, and had a bad experience. Upon entering the restaurant we had to wait almost 10 minutes for the cashier to come and help us. After that was done we tried to locate a table to sit at, however a clean table was hard to find . The middle section by the soda machines had 10 dirty tables. It was around 8 o'clock p.m. when we got here, store was not busy at all. Wife and I had tacos but in the taco meat there was bone fragments and gristle. I took a picture of the dirty tables bone fragment and gristle. We will be going back to our original one that we always go to and not come back to this location."}
{"text":"If you are coming for the steak, be prepared to eat alone.  By the time you get your steak, the rest of your party will have finished.  The steak is cooked to rare and placed into water to wait for your requested order.  Not very appetizing.  The server places small servings on your plate following the long wait.  Old Country recognizes most of us will settle for something else.  The dining experience: If you enjoy kids running around unattended, this is your place.  Parents are inconsiderate of others, as they allow babies to scream uncontrollably without attending to their needs.  My recommendation is to find an option nearby: many to choose from."}
{"text":"Amazing!   Usually we go to Golden Corral...     As always, the food is better, fresher, and all around more appealing.  The breaded foods were done perfectly, not overly breaded or over cooked. The staff was more hospitable, and welcoming. This shall be our new go-to American buffet."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have much to choose from. Waitresses take too long to clean up dirty tables. Beverage area was always dirty."}
{"text":"I have been cut off ran into had people talking and massively loud in my ear and it's not busy in here at all. And that's just from the staff.  That are working the food area . Using the cleaning towel to push down the silverware it is not a good thing when you're filling them."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant while on vacation. With two small kids (ages 2 & 4), we needed variety. The food was average, at best. The drink station was great, and it included milk for the kids. The empty food items on the buffet were replaced promptly. Most of the food was hot. The dessert selections were more than I was expecting. Our biggest issue was having to wait for clean plates and bowls for dessert. The servers were friendly and always offering to help. Definitely not the best food I've had lately, but an affordable option with lots of variety for a family with kids. P. S. We were there on family night (Thursday). Although we did not participate, there were plenty of activities for the kids to create."}
{"text":"First off its a buffet , not a gourmet one you see at a high class vegas hotel or anything.. We moved here 8 mos ago from out of state and have been to another location but this particular location has been a great one! We usually go on Thurs nights because kids are only $1 to eat. Cant beat that! The food has been delicious both visits. The steak is Ranchers Reserve Sirloin and is always tasty and tender. The  hand carved roast beef is a perfect Med rare and is tasty and super tender as well. The servers stay busy so may not get plates off table super fast but its not that big of a deal.. We overall really are impressed with this location! They even have unlimited milk refills and and icee machine too with unlimited refills!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this buffet sllot. He loves his buffets. The people that work here have been here for years.  They're awesome.  I do have to say we only go when there's a coupon because their regular price is too high for what you get. We're disappointed that they got rid of their stir fry, grilled steak, tres Leches cake. I'm not sure I like how their desserts are now. If they are fresh them their good,  but those little cups go stale fast. Tamales are not good just have enchiladas everyday and fill stuff faster.  We usually won't go if it's a Mon or Tues during lunch.  Just not fresh enough.  We like all the managers except the tall skinny one. We have realized that when he's there nothing gets filled and all he does it talk to the waiters waitresses. Hmmm what else.  Oh and we haven't seen the older lady manager for awhile.  I've never seen that lady smile. If she's gone I'm glad."}
{"text":"I had a lunch here not long ago, but it was nothing exciting. It wasn't even the best Old Country Buffet I have visited. The food was very basic and it was hard for me to find things that I really enjoyed. Because of that I decided to eat healthier options that I don't fix on my own, so I suppose that was good in a way. I would say its a good place to go if you are looking for home cooked type foods, but don't want to cook yourself. Just keep in mind that you won't find food that is overly tasty, if at all, here."}
{"text":"Courteous staff and good food.   Sometimes we miss the egg casserole dish at breakfast - always was our favorite."}
{"text":"This was my first time there and I was pleased how nice it was the place is clean the staff is friendly and the food is really good they have these little pans with steak and mashed potatoes and mushroom or pot roast and mashed potatoes, the steak and mashed were great love it they have s good salad bar lots of stuff, and good desert bar.  Will be coming back"}
{"text":"Went with the lowest expectations and wasn't disappointed. Not a fan of buffets or of fried foods or fatty foods.  The clam chowder was ok. The salads were ok.  No alcohol here.  The hot fudge dispenser at the desert bar was empty.  I was buffeted about by annoying fat ill-mannered  mouth-breathing children rooting around  at the troughs unaccompanied by adults.  I think I now fully comprehend why it's called \"buffet\".  I would rather have root canal than return to this place."}
{"text":"Went here because all of us were craving different things and I now wish we all could have agreed on something...it was not an enjoyable meal.  I tried a variety of different foods...fried chicken, meatloaf, pizza, veggies, and a few helpings of chocolate pudding (the highlight of my meal). My wife had roast beef, mashed potatoes and tacos...she enjoyed the roast but the rest was less than inspiring.  My daughter had a plate of \"children's dishes\" ie mac n cheese, pizza, and other finger food...and of course dessert. We were all happy with our desserts but we're left wanting when it came to our meals...needless to say it wasn't worth giving it a 3rd opportunity.  I just couldn't believe how packed this place was, especially since we had to ask the staff to refill several things we had wished to try.  There was one staff member, I wish I had retrieved her name, that was phenomenal and attentive I feel horrible for not getting her name to give her the props she deserves. She and the dessert were the highlights of the meal."}
{"text":"As soon as we pulled up and parked our car in the parking lot, we were greeted by a homeless couple pushing a stolen shopping cart (unless Wal-Mart gives those things away) and parking it right next to the entrance.  This should have been a sign to not go inside but we went in anyway.  Yep, big mistake!  We paid $14 each to get the buffet, and let's just say we should have taken that money straight to the homeless couple outside and said \"here feed me whatever you got in that fancy cart.\"  Of course, they probably would have whipped up something better than what we found inside at the buffet.    Food selection was all over the map, and everything had the lovely after-taste of stomach acid.  For being called \"Old Country Buffet\" there was a complete lack of \"country food\" options.  Most of the food bins were empty and at the carving station it looked like they were cutting up something that could only be found in small third world countries.    I thought to myself, \"well the food is bad, but I'll fill up and get my moneys worth form the dessert bar.\"  Wrong again!  The ice-cream machines were empty and the slice of carrot cake that I got had the texture of shag carpet ripped out of an old porn store from the 1970's.  The pictures shown above should be classified as criminally misleading, or the marketing team at \"Old Country Buffet\" is playing a prank on all it's customers.  A really good one too, cause it fooled me.  Stay away from this place unless you like playing russian roulette with your stomach.  Eating here felt like going back to High School and being pantsed at an assembly, while some clown juggles tennis balls and gives the students advise on abstinence and safe sex."}
{"text":"Not a happy experience. We arrived for a early lunch, only to find the food looking like yesterday's leftovers. Lots of potatoes in various styles and a variety of vegetables.  By the time we got to the table, my chosen veggies were cold. I asked someone in the buffet area about getting some splenda for my coffee and was told the waitress would be over to help with our needs. It's now 25 minutes later and I finally flagged her down. When she returned with the splenda, I felt like she tossed it at me. A lot of money spent for cold vegetables, soggy salad and bad attitudes. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Ivan is easily one of the worst customer facing managers I've encounter; after a coworker inquired about using a discount card he'd used in the past, Ivan was rude, declared \"not anymore\" before stomping off and leaving his new employee to deal with the fallout. She did great, btw. He super sucked."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today.  The cashier gal was nice, but she made a mistake on the cash register so then we had to wait 5 minutes for the manager to come void it out.  Then we sat ourselves in a booth. The waitress didn't even come by our table until 20 minutes into our meal.  She suggested we get our own drinks and utensils and then walked away.  That was the first and only time she came to us.  So the customer service was horrible.  The food wasn't any better.  The only thing that was even remotely \"fresh\" tasting was the salad bar, the rest was old and gross.  It was $30 for 2 of us. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Old Country Buffett gets a bad rap but honestly to me their food (with the exception of the salad bar) is just as good as Golden Corral. The main difference is that this location of OCB and most others are terribly run down. I mean the atmosphere makes you feel poor for eating there. I like that they have a beverage bar here and you can get whatever beverage you want when you choose to (they have sodas, Icee's, and Cappuccino machines). The service is super friendly and accommodating, well worth the money- I just wish this place could get a remodel"}
{"text":"This place surprised me!! We've been back a few times! Why? They have a great salad bar! Broiled fish! And my one indulgence, coconut cream pie!  There is a nice variety of food. Everything looks and tastes fresh. Your drink is included in the price, which I like. That allows me to have a beverage with my meal and coffee with dessert. The cashier and staff are pleasant.   If you sign up on their website for coupons it makes the price very reasonable. And, they will honor their coupons from your phone!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical, but hungry. It's the only place open on Christmas and they are doing it with gusto here. It's packed and the food is varied, hearty, and fresh. All my husband's favorites are here--fried chicken, Caesar salad, potato salad, roast beef, chocolate bread pudding. Folks are indulging holiday fantasies--a whole plate of chicken legs. A modest salad topped with a mountain of fried shrimp. Soft serve ice cream with colorful if unidentifiable toppings."}
{"text":"The people and service was excellent. Food overall was good, chicken Alfredo was horrible but everything else was good. Steaks were my favorite even though there was a line for them overall was a better experience than i first thought. my thing was just the chicken Alfredo  was not as good a my previous experience"}
{"text":"well my stomach still hurts from eating to much. The food was very good as usual for an old country buffet .Sometimes it is good to get the good old American food for a change over all the Chinese and Indian buffets.Mind you I like them  to Everything I ate was very taste,even the mac and cheese was very good. I dont know if it was because I was so hungry or because of the great selections they offered. But man am i full.Matt s. said I love this place and gave it 5 stars well I came close to 5 but fell a little short because the dessert selection was not quite there.The rest of the food was great though so if you are good and hungry you cant go wrong here lots of good eats."}
{"text":"Terrible. Most l of the food was old, no flavor. I ate less than one plate, and didn't want to eat anymore. I said something to the manager, he didn't seem interested in refunding my 15.00. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"The family and I have eaten here several times over the past few years. The food is mediocre, the restaurant & service was good. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday for lunch. Wasn't that busy. Hostess was friendly and proficient on greeting. Food was pretty typical for buffet food but the fried chicken was excellent. Food was hot and tasty. Would go back"}
{"text":"If your don't mind he lowest of the low class then your good. Myself, I'm upper low class so I come here early in the morning to avoid the crowds, its & things.   Food isn't that bad considering it's a cheap buffet."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices.   Will always be a customer for life.   Manager if you have a problem will correct it in a jiffy.   Class A organization"}
{"text":"Mother & daughter outting and we started with coming to breakfast. Love the variety of food they have here. The eggs they mixed with salsa was on point."}
{"text":"Bland food, but plenty of it.  The prime rib was good but the salmon was kind of overcooked.  Watery mashed potato's.  Baked potato was way overcooked to the point it was hardly eatable.  At $14 it seemed WAY overpriced for such a limited selection of entrees. They do have steaks to order, but only one cook to handle the entire restaurant.  The deserts were very good, if doled out in teeny portions.  The usual screaming children and their bad parents."}
{"text":"Dirty. Smelly. Hardly any workers. One worker was on a date next to my table. He would come back and chit chat back at the table with his gf every 5 minutes back and forth. All while I'm sitting there with cafeteria food waiting for the ribs to be refilled only to find out later they replaced it with corn dogs. THEY NOW INCLUDE DRINKS AND JACKED UP THE PRICE FOR DINNER FOR 13.79. DON'T BOTHER GO TO GOLDEN CORRAL."}
{"text":"We go here about once every week or two for lunch/dinner and love it, much better than other popular chain buffets in my opinion.  Today we went here for breakfast for the first time.  The hash brown and cheese scramble is amazing, and they also have the full nacho bar open even though its breakfast time, which is a definite plus.  The prices are great and there always seem to be coupons online that we take advantage of.  Great place."}
{"text":"If I could give it -0 stars I would!! My family went out for dinner and there WAS NOTHING available! The ham they served was fatty, salty and COLD no deserts available when asked, got told let me find out for you the person responsible isn't very efficient.....no kidding. I asked for something and got told ohh give me 6 minutes......really? Especially when I've caught the lady in charge standing around talking for the past 5!! Even the server that comes around collecting dirty plates even was upset that such a thing is going on. By all means please take your family else where unless your all about wasting your $$$$   They have raised the price for such crappy food. :("}
{"text":"If you don't like IMITATION SALAD DRESSING don't come here. I was extremely disappointed after I was craving a salad bar salad & saw/tasted their disgusting salad dressing. I was hoping it tasted better then it looked in the tub... All of them were super transparent & watery. . Tasted horrible!!!  My husband & I ate two bites of our salads & couldn't even eat another. GROSS!  Everything else is just, eh.."}
{"text":"Not the best but wanted breakfast and had a coupon  for the family. The people are nice don't eat her often.might be awhile for I try this place again."}
{"text":"I paid $30 for just me and my boyfriend; for the oldest, nastiest food ever. The fried chicken was so old that I could not bite into it, it was hard as a rock. The macaroni and cheese was cold. The food that was out was practically gone. The pot roast was so dry and old,  I wouldn't even give it to my dog! I decided I'd try to eat a salad since all the other food was crap. I put sunflower seeds on my salad, old and stale, it ruined my whole night. I arrived at this restaurant at a decent time so I'm not sure why I had such a horrible experience. I will never come here again, it was my first,  only and last time here.  Oh, and to top it all off, the food I did consume,  had me sick to my stomach for the next 24 hours. I've never been that sick before! Take my advice and spend your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I've never met a buffet that I've fallen head over heels for, but there are many that I think are just okay- including this one. To be perfectly clear, the 4 star is for the staff alone, the food quality is... well, buffet quality.  I don't think I can really complain, I mean, it was $7.99 for myself and kids eat free (kids meaning my 1 year old). The lady that was taking care of the area that we sat in was pretty chatty and was really nice to Kayden, very sweet lady really. You'll find everything from salads and soups to fish, fried chicken, and spaghetti. Good ole fashioned food. Some meats tasted like they've been out for a while, fruits and veggies were fresh though.  And the guy who was in charge of the hamburger / hotdog area was freaking awesome. He kept asking Kayden if he wanted a hotdog, it was seriously cute. This is your most typical buffet with your-not-so-typical staff."}
{"text":"Nasty just nasty.  I have no idea how people could give this more than 1 star."}
{"text":"Dinner and a drink will set you back for 16.84, And a  very disappointing meal. Big variety, but low quality. For the same money you could get a very satisfying meal at many other nearby restaurants.  Move along nother worth seeing here..."}
{"text":"This place is decent. I like the food I like the desserts especialy the pudding. The part i like most about it is the chicken it is some of the best chicken i have ever had its definitely the third best the only two better ones being the golden coral and homemade chicken. But seriously try that chocolate pudding."}
{"text":"They have a worker here by the name of Hiba that has excellent customer service skills which is something that is rare these days. I noticed the pizza was half cheese and half pepperoni. The half with just cheese had a ton of pepperoni grease on it so I went to the kitchen and asked Hiba if a pizza could be made without pepperoni. She informed me nicely that all their pizzas came with pepperoni on half of the pie. I asked her if she could cut off the pepperoni part before she cooked it, she said she would give it a try but wasn't sure if it would work because the pizza is really soft before they cook it. I thanked her and went to my table to eat my mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, corn and cheese cake. About ten minutes later Hiba came to my table with a huge smile on her face and said here's your pizza. I was so happy to have my cheese pizza without pepperoni grease on it. I was craving pizza since we debated on either going to a pizzeria or this restaurant before we came here. I thanked her and ate my pizza. Give Hiba a raise!  She really deserves it!! I love the cheesecake here. Reminds me of the cheesecake factory.  Adults pay $13.40 and kids under 12 pay $6. Overall the food was okay but I will be coming back mostly because of the service I received from Hiba."}
{"text":"Food's decent but staff is really great. Its a nice place to good for a meal, great for kids. Today they are having a shamrock hunt for the kids with character appearances by Mickey, Elsa, Little Mermaid, and the Easter Bunny.  Christine is the best!! We always try to sit in her section."}
{"text":"The chocolate milk is the best their is!  The food is what it is. It's a Buffett!"}
{"text":"We have been regulars here for years, and it's a BUFFET. It's not about upscale fine dining -- thank heaven. The staff is very accommodating and patient, and since many of the customers are advanced in years, this is a definite plus. The food is basic hearty fare, and there is a good variety considering the wide demographics this restaurant serves. I'm very puzzled by the scattered snarky reviews on this page. My own experience over the past 15 years or so has been very, very different."}
{"text":"Seriously gross food. I'm pretty easy going.. And I only ate a bit of salad and dessert. The food smells bad and looks even worse. Even my boys who all love food barely ate. So disappointing for how much we paid!!!!"}
{"text":"One star because it was open. Very disappointed in variety of food and quality Customer yelling at young child was a little annoying. A little spend and doesn't compare to golden corral. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place needs to clean up, went today, out of ice, soda machine clogged, my water cup had soap stain,dessert bar had a couple plate of each kind, the other side of dessert bar was empty, almost done my peach cobbler found short hair in bottom, the waitress told manager right away no one showed up, and it wasn't busy at all, overall for the price $13.79 , no steak  and poor hygiene, and manager too proud to show up to apologize.. Thought I told myself never come back but I did, but this time for good...Never again! At least at this location"}
{"text":"This review is for the breakfast buffet at this Old Country. I came here for Sunday breakfast, really hungry after a long tiring Saturday with very little to eat,  and it turned out to be a good choice. In addition to typical American breakfast fare (waffles, pancakes, french toast, ham, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, etc.), they also offered menudo and had an omelette bar and a taco bar. I sampled most of the items and the only thing I didn't care for were the pancakes, which were dry. Everything else was good, including the menudo which I enjoyed a lot. The restaurant itself is clean and spacious and the staff is friendly and efficient. I'm looking forward to trying their lunch and dinner buffets soon."}
{"text":"Monday 4:30, family of 4. Seated immediately. This place is good when your family can't decide on one thing to eat because everyone should be able to find something they like on the buffet. $40 total for all of us to fill up including drinks and dessert. Simple food and plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"Very disappointed very pricey for food that taste like store bought frozen vegetables everything was cold was very bland I can believe I pick this place over Soup n Salad where everything is hot and cook fresh, or I should have just gone home. Much smaller then I remember, $ 23.00 dollars is to mush to pay here that food taste so bad."}
{"text":"Good we like it, always satisfied and all ways clean prices for Senior is very good.  A lot of choices very done we will be coming back soon. We'll be recommending this to our friends. See you soon!"}
{"text":"This is probably THE WORST BUFFET RESTAURANT EVER. I came in knowing and expecting we weren't going to be eating five star food but my god. The food was cold, the cake didn't' taste real, and way overpriced for low quality restaurant. The selection was even that big either. Save your money and go to Golden Corral."}
{"text":"My co-worker turned me on to this place.  I don't understand the negative reviews, this is a great buffet for less than $10.00.  There's a salad bar, taco bar with flavorful ground beef taco meat. Great fried chicken, baked fish, tasty meatloaf, pot roast, decent pizza, good desserts and ice cream.  Tons of sides like green beans, corn, potato salad, pasta salad.  This same lunch buffet would cost you $29.95 in Las Vegas.  The staff are friendly and the food stations and restaurant is clean.  I will definitely be coming here once a week for lunch.  Anyone with negative reviews, lets see you cook all this food for $10.00."}
{"text":"Typical buffet with powdered mashed potatoes, lots of chicken dishes, and a decent salad bar.  Place was fairly clean, lots of food and they were bringing out new pans as soon as the other ones were empty or almost empty, so that was good.  The warm bread pudding with soft serve vanilla was soooo good.  Good for what it is."}
{"text":"This is the place for consuming mass quantities. None of it is really good, but none of it is bad. There's enough variety to make it interesting. There's a lot of space, but the tables get pretty close and it can be awkward moving around at crowded meal times."}
{"text":"For the money you'd think the food would be better.  Than they have the nerve to change extra for a drink,I don't think so. Do yourself a favor and find someplace else to eat.   More is not Better"}
{"text":"What the? 6.99 per person and it's a GOOD quality buffet!! We arrived in AZ very hungry and found this next to our hotel so went straight to it and noticed a lot of cars parked outside which indicated it was popular.  inside, was very neat. Workers were continuously filling nearly empty trays. The food is fresh, lots of homemade dishes, very clean, fully stocked, nice staff! The carrot cake was so fluffy and homemade!! i also loved the fried fish, roasted and fried chicken, peach cobbler."}
{"text":"Used to come here. But recently haven't been coming because it feels like they changed the recipe & doesn't taste that great.   They have different food like a salad bar, soup, American, Mexican, Chinese, Italian, ribs, ham, & etc. I love the chicken noodle soup but recently they added chicken chunks even the bone in there and I'm not a fan of that.   They always change the prices. Sometimes the drink is included in the price & other times it's not.  They do have a room in the back where you can have a party or anything else where you want to be alone with your guests.   On thursdays it's family night & kids are $1.99 and sometimes they play movies in the room in the back."}
{"text":"Working here was one of the reasons I was \"festively plump\" during high school.  Although I worked at the Glendale location before (a loooong time ago), this one is equally as bad.  My family used to be enticed by anything with \"buffet\" in the name.  Oh geez, the stories we have about this place are endless and none of which fall under appropriate topics for dinner conversation.  The food isn't that great, as it's hard to ensure quality when you make food in such large quantities.  Plus, the eating habits of some of the clientle will make you worry.  I fail to see the point of eating a salad drowning in ranch.    Two stars for their dessert selection.  Hot, piping bread pudding a la mode was my guilty pleasure..just don't eat too much."}
{"text":"The most nasty food ever I thought this location would be better then superstition but it's just as worse I wish there was a way to give no stars they don't even deserve one!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Staying in the La Quinta nearby. Family style buffet. Had steak on the grill good salad bar standard desserts. Lots of kids. Pretty expensive. Thats about it"}
{"text":"This is going to be my last visit here....after seeing the owner put a dirty utensil in a sauce after dropping on floor, I'm disgusted!!!!"}
{"text":"A-OK.  3 stars.  Good, clean, American Food chain restaurant.  I bought a bunch of gift cards at 50% off, so I have been to this location several times in the past couple of years.  It doesn't excite me, but the food is consistently/reliably hearty and tasty.  Today I enjoyed the pot pies they had out.  Also, their staff is always friendly and sometimes enthusiastic."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and decided to try this place for lunch.  I was very dissatisfied.  First of all, their prices with drink, are higher than Golden Corral, and their food sub par, both with respect to quality and selection.  On the salad bar, the romaine was yucky - wilted, brown, and some pieces with spoiled, black splotches.  Funny, since the iceberg lettuce selection and the spinach was nice and fresh...I assume the manager was asleep at the switch.  Two or three of the chicken dishes were overcooked and dry, as was the marinated (?) pork dish.  The steamed fish was dry and smelled bad; like the fish was old.  And some veggies were squishy, overcooked like what you get in the deep south.  And no beef selection.  It just was not a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Went there on Mothers Day for lunch 2 pm, dissapointed. For $ 15.00 a person, food was below average, things ran out, not kept plentiful for the crowd of the special day...no special dishes, just plain and many things seemed right out the can,  not homemade. First and last visit there."}
{"text":"When you come to the OCB you should know what you're in for. This is a buffet where the shared ingredient in all the dishes is excessive salt and MSG, but who cares? It's what you came here for isn't it? To stuff your body with food that has a marginal nutritional value? I know it's why I showed up.   I for one like to see just how many plates of good I can put down before I'm forced to quit. Dessert time? Skip the tiny plates they provide and grab a dinner saucer. I did the was complimented as a \"guy that knows what he's doing\"  by the dessert attendant.   Plus who doesn't like a place with \"all you can drink\" milk??    By the way, If you're coming here more than once a month, you're in for trouble."}
{"text":"Service was good but not too many choices... More garnishes than anything. And there was a huge cockroach that crawled out from under the salad bar. One of the waitresses stepped on it and cleaned it up."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this buffet three times, once for a Sunday dinner, once for a Monday dinner and once for a Thursday dinner. Sunday was very busy but Monday and Thursday weren't. However, the quality of the food was just as good during the week as on Sunday. Even at 8:45pm they were bringing out fresh dishes when they closed at 9pm. The only reason I knocked it down a star is the price. I've been enjoying it because I've used buy one get one free coupons so my guest and I have been able to dine for dinner, with drinks, for under $14 + tax. At regular price, which would be $9.99 for the dinner buffet plus $1.99 for drinks is a little pricey.   It's totally worth it to splurge for the drinks, though, even if you're normally a water drinker. In addition to Coke products, they have white and chocolate milk, a variety of coffees and hot chocolate, a variety of teas and Icees!  The customer service is great. The employees are friendly. My only real complaint is that there aren't any napkins at the table. You have to remember to get them when you get your silverware at the buffet."}
{"text":"Good food was really uncertain what I wanted for lunch so I stopped in here.  The food selection seems familiar basic country,asian, and Mexican fair.  My only complaints was that it was extremely muggy inside been one of the hottest days in Phoenix the a/c seem to be struggling a bit.  Also lots of water around the fountain drink on the floor please clean it up :)"}
{"text":"I have to say i was impressed.  I was contacted by the manager and the situation was rectified.  Great customer service."}
{"text":"Price is too high for what you get. The food is mediocre , the employees are rude, the manager was leaning on the salad bar talking on his cell phone.  Steak was tough, fish was dry and selection very limited.  Save your money and spend a few bucks more and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love their breakfast!  Not gourmet, but a nice atmosphere!  The staff is very courteous and never rushes you.  The food always looks and tastes great.  I would tell anyone to go there for a nice time, very homely!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Took the whole family there for a little get together for my Daughters 19th Bday.  We had a great time.  The place was very clean.  There was a great selection food, and everything I tried was good. I especially liked the Pork chop I had!  There was a young man working in our section that was very helpful.  He noticed it was my daughters bday, asked her name and had the employees sing to her.  He came by our table regularly and took empty plates and offered to refill drinks.  We used some Groupons, as well as a BOGO that came to my email, and I had no problems!!  I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a family buffet. :)"}
{"text":"So i got tired of Asian buffet when we decided to go to a buffet.  Not being to one in  forever,  now i remember why. Watery mac and cheese. Really slow service one the meat station. Really the best thing is the chicken fingers, potato, and salad. I don't are how this placed is packed when it cost 62 dollars for four adults with drinks. Totally going to a regular restaurant or a different buffet. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and you could refill your own drink. Those are about the only positives of the place. My husband and I tried just about everything and NOTHING was good. Steak, ribs, chicken, fish all dry and overcooked. ALL of the veggies had a weird taste (green beans, carrots, brocolli, spinach) and I'm a veggie lover. The dessert looked really good but did not taste good at all. Definitely not worth the money. Will not be back EVER. Golden Corral is MUCH better"}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  The food is always cold and I have never reached for silverware and not gotten at least one piece that was dirty.  This will be my last time."}
{"text":"Plenty of food to choose from there. If you are going to go I would suggest at dinnertime."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, and price with coupon was convenient ... food was alright not bad but some are bland. Missing some other food choices since it's now have a different owner. I'm not sure if I will go back.  (Ps: I had a stomach problem after 24 hours)"}
{"text":"Steak was good. The ribs were 3 days old they tasted like they had been sitting there. And very pricey for no reason because the food is not that great. Probably won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"The place smells, must be the carpet, but it stinks. Food is cold. Hash browns we're rubbery. The people were pleasant though."}
{"text":"Found a long hair in my fried chicken, other food was lukewarm and the bath rooms were disgusting. I now know why there was not a line up to get in like other places today !!"}
{"text":"Have wanted to go to a brunch buffet for a while so when I realized this was nearby I suggested it for our after church breakfast. Disappointment reigned when we got there and there wasn't a breakfast item in sight! Found out they stop breakfast at 11:00. Strike one.   There was a foul smell radiating throughout the restaurant. Including by the food. Strike two.  It was only 11:45 when we got there so the over done state of the food was unacceptable. Strike three.   The changing table was right in the doorway of the women's bathroom and there were two unused caution cones next to it that my toddler thought were great to play with. Those should be stored elsewhere. Strike four.   Added bonus strike: the rag being used to wipe down the tables looked dry.   Needless to say, we won't be returning. I wasn't expecting much, but what we got was not worth what it cost."}
{"text":"Prepare to pay big bucks for this buffet if you go during dinner.  The price plus your drink is ridiculous especially if your buying say for a family of four.  However, if you go during lunch its more affordable and ends up being a great value.  The food is delicious depending on when you go ( last time we went at 3PM ) they had steaks, roast beef and ham in addition to chicken pizza and all the fixings including dessert and salad bar.  I am not a big fan of their salad bar.  For some reason, it just doesn't look fresh and I love salads.  I frequent the salad buffets quite frequently.  Anyways, go on an empty stomach and enjoy your buffet.  I sure do !  I don't care who stares and what they have to say LOL its a buffet and I am hear to eat especially when I pay good money for it hahaha.  In closing, if you love buffets give Old Country Buffet a try.  They are better than Hometown Buffet and definetly a little cheaper than Golden Corral."}
{"text":"Food was never fresh. All hard bread and dried out meat.  Save your money and gents. To McDonald's if you want trash. Place looks disgusting! Plates, tables, and counters are dirty. If I could rate this place 0 stars I would. The only thing that's fresh are the fruits and salads. Come in the morning for fresh brownies or cookies. Eminems are outstanding though!"}
{"text":"I would like to give 0 stars  This place is so dirty  Went to get a mug for coffee and I swear it was so disgusting full of dirt the whole rack was dirty I told a lady their. Even a man asked me what I saw in the cup. Then again second day upset stomach. I would never take my family their so disappointed of how it became."}
{"text":"I would never go their again.. this place used to be so much better  Last week we went as a family and ate their my stomach could not handle their food so nasty  My Söns also got upset stomach. Too expensive for nothing"}
{"text":"I had a buy one get one free coupon so I thought I'd try this place. The place is large with plenty of seating. My first clue was not many people there. I have never been to a buffet where I couldn't find one thing I liked. I did like the Coke I had. The food was bland and not flavorful. I asked for medium rare for the steak and got a piece of almost well done tough meat. I was told they had butterfly shrimp on Friday but never found where it was hiding, just some teeny popcorn shrimp all breading. First time here and last time for sure."}
{"text":"The price they charge for a drink is OUTRAGEOUS! Sneak a drink in or say you don't want one and get one anyway."}
{"text":"I am finicky and picky. I don't really like buffets. I find the foods usually old, stale, bland...etc. But not this place. The food turns over quickly, it's warm, its clean, there is a huge assortment of food, the salad bar is fresh, the lettuce is crispy. It's actually the best buffet I've ever eaten at, with the exception of maybe the pricier vegas ones.  Way better than any others in the valley."}
{"text":"2 stars for the staff.  I can tell they really care about the customers but the product aka the food just isn't worth paying for.  I recommend someone tell corporate to revamp everything on the menu because it's just \"tired\" and taste freezer burnt."}
{"text":"This location has too many tables and not enough buffet. I counted 5 counters including the drink station. Freakin' Hibachi Grill has way more selection.   Other Country Buffets are great. This one needs therapy. No chicken enchiladas here. Don't you know, Country Buffet, that's what I went there for? They had a tub of chicken tortilla soup but absolutely no soup bowls. Tortilla soup on a plate leaks into the other foods. Not good.   Oh, and they have French fries but the ketchup is nowhere to be found. And that's what I noticed about all the condiments. They aren't next to the right food.   Hubby said the pizza wasn't good. My chocolate cake was very stale. I think the chef was a Le Cordon Bleu dropout."}
{"text":"Not a thing ran out, everything was full and kept hot or cool accordingly. Love the selection.   Only downside is when I bit into some sweet and sour chicken and hit a bundle of gristle. That chicken needs a diet - but it's not really the restaurant's fault. It's odd that they have sweet and sour chicken but no chow mein or eggrolls to go along with it. Hmmm. Still, the variety here is nice: American pizza and whole chicken breasts and some other meats. But I really go for the small sides and they have things like pasta, mac and cheese, pinto beans, broccoli and a salad bar.   Desserts are in small proportions. They also have coffee all day long. Awesome.   My brother-in-law treated us here because we'd helped him move into his new house. Now we are trying to make it back there."}
{"text":"So NASTY! First of all the food has no flavor and nothing tastes fresh!!! The tables and chairs are sticky and dirty. The floor smells like death lol it just feels gross to eat there. In the icecream section some kids were sticking there hands in all the candy toppings. The food just tasted old!! Never ever going back. And I hope u read this before paying. 13 dollars per person"}
{"text":"Man I thought golden coral is nasty. This is 20× worst employees look like they not very clean food empty in buffet not very fresh looking. I would never recommend this buffet to anyone I like lol Save your money go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"So far so good. The staff is super friendly and polite. The food isn't too bad either. It's a buffet and with most buffets it's gonna bit a little different but they have a decent dessert bar and their baked chicken is by far the best thing. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Vincent was a true delight during my parents last visit to this location. He extended a warm greeting while the cashier stumbled to find her customer service footing. While my mom was getting plates for herself and dad, Vincent made casual and friendly conversation with my father.    These visits to local eateries are becoming less frequent for my dad as his Parkinson's disease claims more and more of his mobility and control. For whatever reason Vincent chose to bestow such kindness, it was much appreciated."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting its so dirty and all the food was dried out and I got a salad and there was a huge hair in it I've never had a good experience here its over priced for mediocre food"}
{"text":"Honestly, there really wasn't much of a selection.  I went here because my brother and parents wanted to go, but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"So nasty! We only took one photo of the grime and dirt built up over what is obviously weeks and months, but everything was nasty here. The bathrooms, the carpet, the floors. Even the silverware and bowls were grimey and had residue and filth on them.   If this was in the hood and the food was great, it wouldn't be an issue; but this is Arrowhead and the food was nasty as well. I was with my wife and 3 little ones and we spent $43 for a Sunday lunch. No one hardly ate anything and we all left feeling nauseous and ripped off. It seems only elderly people eat here, most likely because of their failing taste buds and eye sight, but I would also recommend they stay away as well! The last people that should eat here are those with weakened immune systems."}
{"text":"Colleen is SO great. She is very friendly, clears dirty plates super fast and when he greets you she ALWAYS recommends something that is available tonight. Her Valentina, and Itzel are the reasons I come as much as i do. It's a nice way to end a rough day. And they've added some new foods!"}
{"text":"Entry is $9.. honestly, most of the food wasn't that fresh.. I enjoyed the desert however. Not bad though. Lots of variety"}
{"text":"Don't Bring a Big Bag; You May Be Accused of Stealing.  I took my mentally disabled son to Old Country Buffet.  He couldn't finish two pieces of meat, so instead of just wasting it, I thought I'd take it home for him.  Granted that was not the best decision on my part because it's all you can eat there and not suppose to be taken home.  But my logic was, it will be thrown away, so what does it matter.  I had gotten him what he asked for with no intent on taking anything home.  I had a couple of plastic bags from homemade sandwiches we had while out that day, so as I started to put the meat in a plastic bag, the manager came up to me and said the food is to be eaten here, which was okay with me and I put the meat back on his plate.  I calmly told her I was going to take the two pieces home, but if she rather they throw it away that was fine with me.    She then said I know you have a lot more food in your bag, at which time I opened my bag and showed her I had nothing.   She said anyone that has plastic bags in their purse is intent on stealing.  If I wanted to wrap up some food, who needs plastic bags, napkins are always available.  I opened my wallet and threw a $20 bill on the table and told her to take it.  She said she wouldn't and that she was just quoting me policy.  I told her no, that's not what she did, she implied I was a thief.  I have never stolen anything in my life; in fact I've gone out of my way to pay back money that people have given me by mistake.  So really the only thing that was stolen was my appetite for food I had already paid for.  I ate a couple more bites and was too upset to eat any more.  I enjoy taking my son to places he likes, but I'll never again eat at the Old Country Buffet on Southern in Mesa.  Their food is okay if you like the regular fatty, salty restaurant food, but it's not worth stealing."}
{"text":"It was decent, pretty clean and the food wa fresh. I have been back even on Thursday's when they have specials for kids."}
{"text":"As the axiom goes, \"you get what you pay for\" and that is certainty the case here.  Sure, the price ($6.99/ lunch) seems low, but when you come face to face with the food, it screams blandness, unhealthiness, and low quality.  The lunch selections include a taco bar with greasy, high-fat beef, a salad bar that attempts to imitate Sweet Tomatoes but it comes up far short, some other low-quality Chinese and Italian options and a dessert bar.  So, if you are searching for a buffet, I highly suggest that you continue the search and pay a few bucks extra per person for a higher quality and better selection elsewhere.  Learn from my mistake as my first time here was my last."}
{"text":"We come here once or twice a month. Today we came for breakfast. The only reason they did not get 5 stars is they put out lunch around 10:30 and some breakfast items were empty from 9:50 and never refilled (biscuits). Breakfast is advertised from 8-11. The bacon was crisp,  French Toast was fresh, and my husband liked the hash brown triangles.  Christine was our server and she was friendly and helpful. The manager was really trying to check on everyone and keep the kitchen running efficiently."}
{"text":"This place deserves nothing more than a one star  and really not even a 1  I read all the reviews before i went and i was so not wanting  to go their but  it was grandsons Bday and he picked this place... First of all the Price is to high for the food quality   just not right .. And the Food was so so so so so so so bad  ribs dry chicken dry  the chicken pot pie was just all crust taco meat was so so so greasy  crappy cheese   mash potatoes where so sticky  could hardly get them of spoon  steak  was so tuff would have to chew for days to swallow... im telling  you the truth people this place has crappy food and the price is a rip off ..  cant find anything that was good abt this place other than i came in and got out of the cold..   Please Believe me when i SAY this place servers the worst crappy food.  Go at your own risk  could become food poisning for sure.. :P :P :P"}
{"text":"The food is not that great. Chicken was good, but the corn tasted synthetic. Very pricey, not many food choices. The wait staff were very nice."}
{"text":"The food is poor quality.  The restaurant is filthy and the restrooms should be condemned.  Would not even recommended this restaurant to the dead."}
{"text":"I like going here because it takes the guess work out of \"whats for dinner\"   Get whatever the you want...   Example: Kid #1 had mac n cheese, meat loaf and bread.  Example: Kid #2 had jello and peperoni, and something else.  Example: I had steak, Jojo's, baja lime chicken, garlic bread, grilled veggies and carrots.  Round 2 K#1 had chicken leg, bread, ham, mashed potato's K#2 had baked fish and a roll I had more baja lime chicken, garlic bread and a dry hunk of roast.   Dessert K#1 made a god awful mess of brownie, and fudge, ice cream and sprinkles. k#2 had twist ice cream I had banana pudding  After writing what I just ate I think I should be ashamed. BUT I never over do it at buffet's. In fact I fell good, not stuffed or anything.     The only bad thing was the price. $30 bucks, it used to be $99 cents for kids and not $12 for adults. BTW (12 and over is adult) Lame..."}
{"text":"Good solid Buffet.   The guy grilling was on top of it. The seasonings bar was need too, you can add whatever you wanted to any of the food. I used some Emeril seasonings on the steak.   The staff was nice, but they started to charge extra for the Beverage bar... drinks are no longer included unless your a kid."}
{"text":"Great for kids. For the low price of $1.99 each I can feed my kiddos veggies drinks dessert. Cheaper than fast food and just as fast.  The place is always clean and friendly. The food is ok and there are certainly enough choices to satisfy and age or diet."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming to Old Country with my family. They have a  decent variety of food that you can choose from. The staff is always welcoming and friendly which is a huge plus that I always take into context when rating. The price is fair and the best time to go with kids is on Thursday's! Love that they honor veterans all over their walls with pictures."}
{"text":"If you set your expectations accordingly for a low-cost buffet, then I think you'll be pleased. Despite being fairly quiet on a Friday afternoon the food kept coming out hot and fresh.   The roast chicken is among the best items but the fried chicken, mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese are good too.   Plates were promptly cleared and it was a cheap and not bad lunch overall."}
{"text":"Great variety. All fresh, hot food. Similar to a Golden Corral type place but arguably a touch better overall good quality. Great value too. In a place where many buffets could be sketchy this place is a pretty good choice."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre at best, and then I found out this morning (11/6/2016) that since two weeks ago they are now charging $2.49 extra for drinks on top of the regular priced meal prices. As soon as I use up my remaining sweetjack coupon vouchers I will start going to Golden Corral for better food at a better price.  Also midway thru my meal when I was getting my dessert, they removed my red color coded water glass.  Funny how one of the floor managers was complaining about business being slow when they are normally packed with snowbirds this time of year.  At this higher price point, there are a lot more options."}
{"text":"I took my family here for Christmas. The food was ok considering the price was a little high $14.95 a person! It was all very salty and the choices were not as expected for a Christmas meal. The customer service was excellent considering there is none in most businesses."}
{"text":"Not good. OCB is not a place for quality dining. It is best suited for folks who prefer quantity over quality."}
{"text":"OCB was good several years ago. It has gone down hill and now it is nothing more than a place for people who value quantity over quality."}
{"text":"less selection for some reason than the last time I was here which was bout 3 months ago. Some items were also a bit cold. Staff was nice though"}
{"text":"Extremely warm in the building hard to enjoy myself. The steak was awesome, tender, juicy!"}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped for breakfast.   As we went through the buffet and selected our food,  my husband went to get some cooked to order eggs.   He told the cook what he wanted (scrambled well), she told my husband that the scrambled eggs were over there & pointed to the eggs in the warmer.  My husband said he wanted his eggs well,  not wet like in the warmer & she then told him \"no\".  She would not cook scrambled eggs.   We did speak to the manager & our money was refunded but in a customer service based job,  I think CUSTOMER SERVICE is very important.  I personally will not visit this restaurant again due to poor customer service."}
{"text":"I must admit, for the price, it's pretty cool. Especially if you join the email club and get the coupons. As far as the quality of the food.....I wouldn't rate it the best. The food is not really seasoned, the dishes doesn't smell the best, and you can tell the carpet is old and has that certain \"old carpet\" smell. If you're just going there to get full for a low price, especially with other people, it is a cheap way to go. I personally think the ones in PA and NJ are better taste wise."}
{"text":"Headed here while we were out and about in the area and looking randomly for a place to eat. We passed this place and decided to head on in. Buffets are always good for having a variety of options for anyone in your party.  The hubs was happy to see tacos as an option here! The ground beef was tasty and there were plenty of topping options that you could choose from and customize it the way you like it. The fried chicken was overdone, but the meatloaf was good!   I didn't care for the ice cream, since it tasted a lot like a flavored whipped cream more than an ice cream - but the hubs enjoyed it, so it's totally a personal thing. The banana pudding, however, was very good.  Our waitress was very friendly and stopped by periodically to check in.  Overall: B+ It's Old Country Buffet - head in and expect some southern style down home cooking, and you'll be good to go!"}
{"text":"We got here around 7pm. All of the food looks like it's been sitting a while. There were no steaks and no one at the grill station. Someone finally showed after 5 minutes and we asked if we could get anything medium rare and the guy told us \"What you see is what you get.\" That is so unprofessional! None of us finished any of the food on our plates because it was just nasty. We won't be back here again."}
{"text":"For 2 people dinner was $30.00 and mediocre to say the least. Seafood salad had all the seafood picked out, food looked aged.  The rotisserie chicken was very dry. The desserts were old looking as well. The brownie was crunchy.  The only think that seemed good was the chocolate milk. Lots of food choices. I however won't be back. I'd rather spend my money on a good fresh meal."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill bland food poor employee service and run of the mill.  Come on guys do with it get some new ideas"}
{"text":"Not good food and employees was nice gm was nice to help me out with getting food and seating I would give it 3 out 5 stars"}
{"text":"Horrible food restroom smell like shit and employees were rude not asking if I need help this place sucks"}
{"text":"Please Do not come here the manager is terrible I am a regular customer with me and my family we had just arrived my dad got steaks and the manager  told us we had  too many at a buffet????? He was counting everything we were eating then he proceeded to tell us we needed to leave ."}
{"text":"The last time I was there, They had the nerve to want to charge me for a to-go water for $.99 cent. F**** this place. I just got done dishing out $8.50 for lunch, then that was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try on a whim while in the neighborhood last night. The food seemed of really low quality; most of it tasted boxed (instant). The staff was friendly and tentative and the steak I tried was tasty, but unfortunately those few positives aren't enough to bring me back/: I could've gotten something MUCH better and fresher with the $11.29 it cost me to dine here. Bummer!"}
{"text":"So I will say that this place has improved in the last year.  It is a buffet, they have a decent salad bar, and the taco bar is good.  They are a bit lacking on high quality main dishes, but they have a ton of what I would consider side dishes.  There is almost never any difference in what they serve, month after month it is the same.  It would be good if they had a few more dishes that they rotated in and out.  I would love to see beef stroganoff, or something like that.   It is hard to explain.  Going here is like going to a kitchen with 150 different things ready BUT everything is separated into ingredients, and you have to put them together.  For example, There is no rice, broccoli cheese pilaf, but all the ingredients are there so you basically have to make it on your plate.  It is like this is ran by picky people who never want their food to touch, but then the flavors never mix up and get really good.  This is a good thing for our kids, and I am ok with it, because I am creative and can make things myself.  I have had a few problems in the past here, with bones in food that should not have bones, or other things that were sub-standard, and EACH time they gave me a card for a free meal in the future, which I though was nice of them for just a small problem.  They recently made their drinks included in the price, a smart move, and they have a lot of drink selections.  The Sweet tea was empty 3 of the last 4 times I went there, and that is my main drink.  They have Chocolate milk which the kids love."}
{"text":"Awful! I have never given a restaurant such a bad review, ever. My family use to come here often when I was younger and it was great. We had coupons so decided to try again and now i see why they need to offer coupons and specials to get people in the door. There was nothing that i tried that I would deem \"good/tasty\". The food was gross, only once did someone come take ours plates and the sodas were watered down. I needed to change my baby while there and pictured is their changing table in the women's bathroom. That is UNACCEPTABLE! My apologies to other customers for having to change my baby at my table but i was not putting my child on that broken changing table."}
{"text":"Been there many times before, this was the worst time ever.  Food was very bland, most of it was cold.  Plates and dishes looked really old and not clean and not many out to choose from.  Most of the food choices were mainly carbs.  Steaks were not available due to some new steak dishes that were all unhealthy.  It is very overpriced unless all you want to do is gorge on bland food."}
{"text":"The food was better than usual.  After my husband and I finished we were sitting for a visit and big f-ing COCKROACH ran over my husbands arm to get to his empty plate. We promptly left for our car where I puked my guts out in the parking lot. We let them know they had a cockroach problem and the manager was totally unfazed \"okay\" was all we got.  Seriously guys go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Under new management? It's been over a year since we last ate here.   I had an uneasy feeling as we got out of our car, but I didn't want to show my uneasiness. While walking in, I saw a big glob of chunky yellow substance, I almost turned around. I told my husband,  \"Let's go to another place, I think this is a sign.\" He gave me that look a husband gives his wife when he's not changing his mind. \"Ok, nevermind.\" As we got closer, we discovered it was cheesy mac and cheese. Shrugs shoulders okay, continue on. It must be that good for someone to sneak it out. I told the hostess, \"Just so you know, there's food in the parking lot, you might want to have someone clean it up.\" She just smiled.  Umm okay. Still cautious, I decided on salad. Finally I was brave enough to try some hot food (french fries & stuffing). My husband came back with his plate, fried chicken, mash potatoes, gravy, mac and cheese! I have always raved about their fried chicken when we ate here in the past. My husband took one bite and it was bloody. I surprised myself by not overreacting. We calmly told the waiter.  My daughter and I decided to get dessert (cookies, still playing it safe). We both came back and the manager or owner was at the table. She apologized & said, \"We took the chicken back and carefully took it apart.  We discovered it was a vein that popped and was full of blood.\" I gagged & nearly got sick all over the table. I exited the building, there was still that yellow glob still in the parking lot, that did it for me, I got so sick.  Sorry to the people who saw me get sick outside the restaurant. Never, ever going back. My husband came out with ONE coupon to eat free. I shook my head and said,  \"You can eat here all by yourself next time.\"  He crumpled it up and threw it away."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!! Avoid it at all cost! the staff is mean and rude, They don't give eye contact, and asked me to leave when I was not ready nor was my party! The lady manager is horrible!! This place needs to close immediately.    The mash potatoes did not have any favor to it."}
{"text":"Enjoyable,family type eatery.  They have a bit of everything to suit everyone.  I venjoyed a nice piece of medium rare steak grilled perfectly complimented by popcorn shrimp.  The service was adequate, never noticed used plates on table disappeared in a blink of an eye. Not my first time dining here, definitely not my last.  My family enjoys it Everytime we go."}
{"text":"Love this place. I mean it is Buffett but you get exactly what you pay for. There is a ton of old peeps that eat there too. It really is one of the best buffett I have ever had (this style). Kids love it and there is a selection for even the pickiest of kids."}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of buffets. Mediocre food (but all you can eat of it) makes me wonder why people will go for quantity over quality. Old Country Buffet is a convenient location for a women's group I belong to and I have eaten there numerous times, usually when there are 80-100 of us. Service and assistance have always been good and management has always treated us well. I would normally have rated the food as just \"okay\" but since I was there for the group activity, it was never  an issue. This weekend, only a dozen of us met and frankly, with more time to concentrate on the food I was impressed. There was a dramatic improvement from previous visits. We arrived around 10 am so the offerings made for a nice brunch. Food was hot and plentiful. Items were replaced as soon as the quantity dropped. All of us noticed the freshness and how perfectly ripe the fruit was. There were numerous positive comments about the eggs, the fried chicken and the sausage. Vowing to stay on my diet, I filled my plate with fruit and salad and vowed to concentrate on low carb/low calorie items. Then, I walked by an island with a tray of exquisite sticky pecan buns. I initially resisted! I walked right past them. Unfortunately, when I went back to locate a straw, they called to me even louder and I succumbed. Actually, they were so good I eventually went back for a second one. These rolls were an absolute highlight  and upon my return home I immediately began to atone for my sins--another 30 minutes on the treadmill at top speed. But, they were absolutely worth it!! Now, if they would just pay a little more attention to cleaning the seating areas I would go back here more often."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The waitress was a little abrasive when she asked to see our receipt. Her attitude changed as time went on."}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer at this location and its quality has suffered.  A couple weeks ago, on a weeknight during prime dinner time, some food was burned, dried out and basically inedible.  Tonight I was there again...and they brag about their 'cooked to order stir fry\".  Basically it was inedible.  The 'cook' didnt know what he was doing and put 2 HUGE scoops of sauce on the chicken and the sodium/salt taste was so strong and you couldnt eat it.  I complained to a waitress and they wanted to make it again for me or told me next time to add my own sauce.  How about you teach your cooks how to make the food right in the first place!  Seriously...I've gone here for years and she shouldve contacted the manager and a refund shouldve been given...at least on one of the above occasions.  Sadly, many of the OCBs have closed...the writing seems to be on the wall about this one as well. Theres such potential but they arent managing things very well."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a buffet.  Try it out.  I've only gone for the Dinner Buffet so my comments are related only to that..  If you sign up for emails they offer coupons ranging from a few $'s to Buy1 get one.  The drinks are additional... just like breakfasts in the area, you pay for coffee if there are coupons or discounts.  Fattening and health food abound.  Salads are basic and add-ons will please you.  There are hot veggies, string beans, mashed and fried taters, at times Yams... peeled...Hot rolls too.  Slim pasta offerings . Fried chicken & Chicken Teriyaki too.  Corn muffins are always out. There is a Taco bar where the \"fixins\" are nicely laid out; , the taco beef is well seasoned.  A carving station is towards the back, usually, Turkey or Ham that will be carved for you and trays of barbecued items.  My favorite right there is the grill:  The steaks are well seasoned but on the salty side so if you want one unseasoned the grille chef will accommodate you and get a fresh one telling you it will take 10 minutes or so.  I love a rare steak so I ask for 1 and have always been accommodated.  Yes, there is cartilage at times, and gristle, otherwise it is well prepared and a pleasure to eat.  Think Mashed potatoes and green beans...your basic American fare.  The beverage choices will delight kids.  I stay with water since I'm getting older and have to stay trim because I know what's best for me.  Then the desserts,... OUCH!  Ice cream, cup or cone, cakes, Banana cream pie slices, Jello up front near the salads if you like that.  A bowl of whipped cream to add to your calorie count, just spoon it on your sweets.  The service people take your dirty dishes as you forage for more delights, they ask if they can get you more water, and will engage you in conversation if that pleases you.   I go there once a month on average.  I can go on, but I'll end by saying for $22 - $26 for a couple (without coupons) depending on drink selection, it is worth a try.  We all have different tastes because of our past experience with food as we grew up in our households.  Keep in mind there has never been a generation more spoiled than the 21st century children and adults. The poorest of us live better today than the Kings of the 19th century and millennia before."}
{"text":"My family & I have been here 4 times so far. So with that being said, I can say is safe to say its a Great place! The food is fresh & tasty great verity, healthy & hardy. Management & employees replenish the foods needed quickly. They all part take in a cleaned & maintained buffet for a very busy restaurant. The price $$ I feel is fair for the quality of the food & dinning experience. Remember no tipping is needed & they clean your mess.  We love this place & it's our family dinning go to place!!"}
{"text":"Even though its a 1.5 hour trip from Paradise Valley where i live now it is worth the trip. I pay $ 7.99 for a meal that i can eat as much as i want and the selection of food is good they have everything from American, to Italian, to Chinese, to everything you could want. and the best part when your ready to go home if you pay an extra 99 cents you can take food and drinks home. so i can get 2 meals for under 10 bucks here. and for someone on a tight budget at the moment this is a good choice for dining. And the selection of desserts is off the chain. And another + is the staff is friendly and knows how to run the place smoothly which is another thing i look for."}
{"text":"This place keeps going downhill.  Went tonight for the first time in a while. Drinks are no longer included in the price. It was the one advantage they had over Golden Corral. But not anymore. Golden Corral's hot food is fresher and much better tasting. Old Country has a slightly better salad bar.   The worst offender is the carving station. The roast beef is usually a dried out husk. Once or twice in the last decade was it actually pink in the middle. I guess the chef doesn't know roast beef shouldn't be well done.   Tonight I had a coke, a small salad, some dried out roast beef with mashed potatoes, a piece of fried chicken, some zucchini, some acorn squash, and a piece of pecan pie. Not worth $16.   Lunch is worse than dinner. Crappy pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches, hot dogs etc.. It's one thing to serve cheap slop, but when the slop isn't even that cheap, it's not worth going anymore."}
{"text":"K I was trying to be hopeful that the reviews where wrong. My autistic nephew was the first t give us signs as he sniffed the jello! Then sniffed the chicken. The restaurant has a horrible odor of mold and pesticide like smells. I tried meatloaf and it was horrible. So I tried a salad. Nothing tasted right. The restrooms in ladies restroom had panels missing in cieling and it felt so creepy.  I think the health dept needs to inspect and shut this place down. Food not served at appropriate temps, old food, and toxic smells. Oh and dead pigoen ploutside by my car! Ill never forget my nephew sniffing jello! Who messes up jello! I want my 66 dollars back."}
{"text":"The food was average  with lots of variety. However there's not a lot of healthy foods to choose from except for the salad bar. I did ask about the oil on the salad bar and the manager went to the back to confirm it was olive oil without soybean oil. The \"servers\" were very polite as well as the lady's cleaning up the bars. Over all the experience was good"}
{"text":"Very very bad. All of the food was stale and cold. All of the meat/chicken was dry. And the worst of all, I paid $25 for two people. We will never go back there."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a very long time, decided to come here when I couldn't make up my mind on where or what to eat. I don't think they have many options... The other buffet has more. It is less insane though... Staff were all friendly. I had the roast beef it was good, had veggies broccoli carrots and all were cooked correctly... Nothing under cooked. Had mash potatoes they are definitely from a mix or powder but we liked them...the rolls were good.... Fried chicken was good... Yes I get my grub on. My husband said he thought it was good.. Kid agreed... Dessert I tried the cheesecake and peach cobbler I didn't care for either one... All in all we would come back."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time years ago and the place was always packed. I don't know what happened, but the food today was lacking in flavor and quality. This used to be the place to be during the week and weekends because of the great food . I guess the place has gone downhill and the manager doesn't care about how the food looks and tastes anymore."}
{"text":"We come here on Sunday mornings for the brunch buffet. We really like it. its about $12.00 per person. The French toast is very good. My daughter loves the Counbtry Fried Steak."}
{"text":"The first time I had Thanksgiving lunch here with family and it was very good! They had a great variety of food, including salad bar, desserts, and a grill and a mixture of American, Asian, and Mexican dishes. One of my favorite desserts was mixing the orange sherbet with vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Never been to an Old Country Buffet but it was not that good. The food was good. It was cold or anything like that.  It just didn't have as much selections as other buffets . What is does have is somewhat of a little Mexican section. It's has tortillas, nachos, ground beef, salsa and some other things as well. It has a salad bar, a small carving stations and the rest is what other buffets regularly have; pizza, orange chicken, Mac and Cheese, etc. The desert section was better than expected. The red velvet cake was amazing as well as the other deserts they had. Ice cream was there as well, there was only chocolate, vanilla and a mix of chocolate and vanilla. This buffet is a good stop if you're hungry and nearby."}
{"text":"They have a grill for those steaks that u are craving for. Typical ham and roast beef! It was good for the price and for my boys who are at that age they can't stop eating."}
{"text":"I use to enjoy going in but with this year's price hikes and deep cuts in quality and selection, my wife and I have lowered our expectations of this location (and rating). We use to bring family but if it doesn't satisfy, what's the point? I did write the location to notify them of the declining quality and got a nice response but one letter isn't enough to make a difference."}
{"text":"Yummy!  We love this place.  It is right by Arrowhead Mall so after a long day of shopping it is great to walk right in and have food hot and ready.    The food here is wonderful and they have a variety of items, including a Mexican food bar which I love.  I especially love their enchiladas.  Can't get enough of them suckers.  They cook steaks to order and they are juicy and delicious and they have other scrumptious meats ready and waiting at dinner time.  They have pizza, fried chicken, pasta, mashed taters, veggies and a big salad bar.  All the normal foods you expect at a buffet can be found here.  I love all the beverage choices, including the chocolate milk and icees, and let's not forget about the ample dessert selections.  You get in and out pretty quickly but last time we went on Mother's Day so the line was a little long.  I think they have a cheap family night once a week and they walk around passing out cotton candy.  They did last year so hopefully they still do  This place really deserves 4.5 stars for having consistently good food for a fair price.  I took off points because pricing is not listed on their website and you have to pay for your drink separately.  King's Table back in the day included it all.  Would love to see this change.  Would also love more discount coupons to be sent thru their Crave Club.  This is the best buffet in town.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Lol never go here. nothing is fresh went here for lunch today &i must say nastiest buffet ive ever been to in my life. Dont waste your money   Good service but really bad food."}
{"text":"Most buffets will cook average tasting food because they know people come to eat a lot not caring about quality. This Old Country Buffet is the complete opposite. Everything I tried there had great flavor and was heated to the right temp. It will be hard to resist coming back every week!"}
{"text":"Institutional food at best. Sevice was great, but not enough to overcome the food quality. This is mac n cheese with powdered cheese, pudding from a can, cheesecake with a slight chemical taste?, etc. Sorry guys, your great but your food is not unfortunately."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch.  Should have known something was up, when it was 11:50 on Sat. and hardly anyone in the place.  As we tried to gather our lunch the coffee cups were all beat up and had a weird white film on them.  They had plates (took 4 to find a clean one) but only a few folks were left and most were dirty.  Nothing was equipped any where. Desert area had no ice cream bowls or spoons on either side.  Many of the food bins had no food in them, or just a dried up dab in the corner.  None of the food was really hot, and chicken bin had 3 dried up pieces laying there.  Salad dressings were that weird slimy consistency.  Lots of dirty tables, and lots of junk on the floors. Some of the deserts had been sitting a long time and were dried up or weeping......     We sort of nibbled a little this or that (what was at the right temp) and left.  Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch today at 2:30.  It wasn't very busy so I took a small booth.  The salad bar had all the regular fare.  When I went to get hot food I noticed that everything was either dried up or missing.  They had baked beans that were stuck to the bottom of the pan and all dried up.  Rolls were dried up.  Sliders in dried up buns and warmed over tough meat.  There was no regular coffee or cross cut potatoes.  There were a few slices of sausage in BBQ sauce that was dried up.  No cookies, and just 2 cuts of carrot cake that looked like they had been out there for a long time.  The crisps in the small metal pans looked like they had been cooked a week ago and dried up.  I was very disappointed and felt like they were done with lunch and were not interested in serving anyone else; but they did take my money.  There were 2 men in the booth behind me and I heard them say it was the 2nd time they at been there and had the same experience.  If you don't want to serve people at 2:30, then close your doors.  Now we are not talking about fine dining, but the food they offer should be available and fresh no matter what time of day."}
{"text":"I found it, okay, I was glad that they know how to do CS, it was a line and still they did a great job in %ing off the bill because of that, still  -1 what is that thing that is growing in the glass part, of the front door/line up; it's in the last glass on the left -1 dust on all the food tops -2 as they don't clean their bathrooms, pee\"cake is not for anyone  It hard to say that they got good food, when hungry fist off and then the way they don't clean their bathroom and or dust"}
{"text":"I came here Friday night with some friends and have to say, its not so bad.  It's been A VERY long time since I have been to an old country buffett....the old out of sight out of mind syndrome.  We went for dinner service, and foro the 3 of us to eat, with drinks it was about $37.  Ouch.  I was expecting it to be about $30 for all of us, but it was a few dollars more then we had expected.  No big deal really, just wasn't planning on spending almost $40!  Not bad though.  I have to say, they had quite a selection.  They had several different buffets going, and many dishes that looked good.  They even had a grill area that had a chef guy cutting food....nice!  I got a little bit of steak, and it was tasty.  yummy.  Anyways, not such a bad place.  Will probably be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Nasty place. Smells like cigs, dirty silverware, didnt restock anything since we have been there, waiters dont speak english or understand what you tell them. People are rude to old timers, no respect what so ever. You pay a high price for this? Ha! Ill go somewhere forget this place. You cant give good customer service and stuff, i cant give a good review! Terrible save your money, wouldnt be surprised if they go outta business!"}
{"text":"Expensive hospital food! I left with a stomach ache and had only ate 3 different things of food trying to make an effort to not reject it. I use to come growing up and remember it being soo good and I was sooo disappointed. The place needs to be remodeled as well. I could of dined in at Olive Garden for the price I paid for 2 buffet lunch."}
{"text":"OCB was once a delicious place to eat .  Ate there last week and this week.  The quality of food both times  was very poor.  The mashed potatoes were instant not home made and the stuffing was very old and hard.  What happened"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed that they have recently added the price of the drink into the cost of the meal. If you do not like any of the sodas that they have you still have to pay for it. Also they no longer have white gravy on Thursdays, The chicken appears to of been refried because it's tough and nasty. They used to have carved meet for lunch on the menu and they are now removed as well. I am very disappointed in the way that this restaurant has regressed  through the years."}
{"text":"Considering fast food?  If you have the time, and you're in the area, don't do fast food--come here.  You will have about ten times the selection of better quality food, and all you can eat, for about the same price or just a hair more that you would pay at a fast food joint.  You know that BK portions are getting smaller and you are still hungry after eating $7 worth of food.  Here, you can go back and eat until you are stuffed, whatever they got.  A stomach full of good food at a low price is always nice.  You'll get it here."}
{"text":"Food was old and dry like it was sitting all day beans were so dry they were white.  They had 1 enchilada so dry it curled. We just left got a refund. Don't go here unless you don't mind dry hard food. The one on bell road is way worth the drive. Poor manager will get decreased numbers."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to be so negative but this place was so gross the only thing I enjoyed was the coke.the food was so dry and no flavor to any of there dishes.i would never recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 and walked in the door at 8:40pm on Friday night, 12-1-17. We waited at the empty cashier stand for a few minutes and a blonde woman came over and said \"we close in 15 minutes so....\" Basically telling us to leave. Another large family came in right after us and were also turned away. Another family was getting out of their car and was going to go in and we told them that we were all just turned away. I'm rough guessing that you lost approximately $150+ in sales due to the cashier turning your customers away. I'm just wondering if the owner of this location is aware that they are losing LOTS of money due to their staff turning people away before they close. No worries, Denny's was open and they got our money instead and they were much nicer. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I think I've said this in previous review but buffets are my weakness!! Even an american chain that I've been to in other states that I've left less than impressed with. Sometimes you just crave junk food you know? I have been to this location about 3 times and each time I've gotten exactly what I came for-   1. waiter that doesn't bother you (ask you how your food is while you've got a mouth full!) 2. dry/extra salty yet still variety of food 3. unlimited drinks and unlimited food  If that's what you expect, you won't be disappointed!  The wait staff is pretty much what you would expect at a buffet (although the last time we were there the waitress didn't pick up our plates even once..eh I can deal). They have RASPBERRY ICED TEA! Sorry for the caps but that's literally 60% of the reason I go to this place. The other percentage is because of the shrimp (very salty but i like salty), french fries, pizza and soft serve ice cream. I'm pretty easy to please and revert back to my childlike tastebuds and enjoy the heck out of it!  The price is decent but I'm almost certain it went up a bit since the last time I had been there. Don't get your hopes too high and enjoy your childhood favorites!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with Rand H., Robyn N. and Mike C.  It had been months since I'd seen them so it was nice to chat over lunch.  This is an old fashioned american buffett.  The fried chicken was good, the buffet area was clean and the service was good.  This one is A-OK for the price and the variety."}
{"text":"A good enough spot to eat. I have to say its neither worst or best buffet. I enjoy the breakfast items especially the French toast. I love that they're one of the last buffets to have chocolate milk and not charge extra for it. I was really impressed with the new desserts. But any place that had unlimited bacon , you have my vote.lol. Great spot if you're single or with a group."}
{"text":"Not one of our better visits here today. All of the meats...ham, salmon, chicken and roast beef were all over cooked. The soups were really good and the service very friendly. I'll try again another time and update my review."}
{"text":"My husband and I have always loved coming here as we have two very different tastes in food and Old Country has a wide verity to choose from. Sadly, tonight will be our last visit.  We came in for dinner, they were pretty busy nothing out of the ordinary for a Saturday night. My husband got some chicken tenders, and took a bite into one... it was RAW inside. Not just a little raw either, this piece of chicken was completely pink in the center. We cut open each piece on the plate (about 6 of tenders) and ALL OF THEM were under cooked. First, we took it to our waitress, Colleen... She seemed only mildly concerned and said she would take it to the manager. So, we wait... Colleen is still chit-chatting with guests and busing tables. She then comes back to us and simply says she told the manager but did not have time to wait--fair enough, she had a job to do. We decide to go back to the cashier and just get a refund (we spent about $30 for dinner) and have dinner elsewhere.  We get to the counter and I tell the girl what happened and that I would like the meals refunded, she says that should not be a problem (she said \"they are pretty generous with the refund policy\") and calls the shift leader to the counter.  I explain to the shift leader about the raw chicken that they have out, she is totally unconcerned and responds with \"I don't eat chicken, so I am not sure I understand.\" Wait, WHAT?!? You work in the food industry but don't understand the severity of serving raw chicken? The shift leader then calls the general manager to the counter to approve the refund, he never asks or is told why I need a refund in the first place. I got my refund with no problem but never once did I get an apology or even see anyone remove the uncooked chicken tenders from the serving table. It is one thing to have awful customer service but I have heard of places getting shut down for a lot less than serving raw meat."}
{"text":"A year ago I would have given OCB a 4 star rating. Then things changed. Selections and quality dropped. In an effort to save money, OCB started having single serving items, such as pot roast , sit undera heating lamp. The pot roast is so dried at that it has the texture of jerky. Items are not replaced in a timely way. Service continues to be their shining star. What a disppointment this has become. If there was a Golden Corral in Arrowhead I have no doubt OCB would have to shut their doors."}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Glendale just in front of the mall.  For me it was a bit difficult to figure out the entrance from the street so I just entered by way of the mall entrance.   Parking is plentiful.   Place is clean both outside and in and well lit.   I found the place a bit small inside with the spacing between the seating a bit close seeing as I had to maneuver to get to the food bar.  I can imagine if the place is filled with people it might be difficult to move between the tables. (-1)  Menu - a party of 3 and we paid about $30 plus one in our party had a drink which was about $2.29 extra....not too bad.  Service - The staff was very friendly.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and pricing was explained especially the extra for drinks.    Food - It's buffet food and though it's not as extensive as some other buffets I've seen or encountered there was enough variety except maybe in the dessert department though I'm not going to minus points for that.   Rating - 4/5."}
{"text":"Salad bar is bigger than the main entree bar. That's being modest. Protein choices included: Fried Chicken, Baked Chicken, Beef tacos, oh, and orange chicken. That's it, three choices. I do not know who keeps this place in business. It's not the same place I used to visit as a little kid."}
{"text":"This place is horrid. Probably the worst $10 i will ever spend in my life. The food looks like prison meals but tastes worse and is old. Let alone the place is disgusting and not clean dont waste your money here go somehwere else. Guiness book of world records worst food in history award goes to Old Country Buffett"}
{"text":"The utensils are stained and spotted with hard water and half-assed washing, the food selection is minimal with literally half of it being salad and taco ingredients.  They get two stars instead of one because I did not get food poisoning, and the tiny carving station they had had barbecue brisket that wasn't awful."}
{"text":"Went here today for Christmas dinner and I am glad I did.  I didn't have high expectations, however the food exceeded them and was very fresh and tasted quite well.  The friendly environment made it all the better."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to eat here.  I used to work in the area so I came here all the time. They always have decent food here.  Usually the salad bar has a ton of options and is fresh but yesterday a lot of wilted, brown lettuce.  I barely ate anything off the plate.  They do have a nice taco salad station that is always good.   Nothing at the carving station but it was only 3:30.  They have that going on Sunday's and, I'm assuming for dinner.  I have been there once for Sunday brunch and there were more options, including top sirloin which was quite good.   I have been there a few years ago and they did have the carving station going but not yesterday.  They used to have at least hamburgers and hot dogs but maybe I was to late yesterday but I did not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Update time... I usually only come here for breakfast when I have a text or email for the $6.99. Prices increased somewhat... it is now usually $9.50 for breakfast... which since they include beverages in it now is only 35 cents more than it was... but you don't have the option to not get a beverage.   Either way usually I come around 10:30 so that I can get some breakfast, a plate of lunch and thier delicious desserts. The breakfast food is usually great and the lunch is okay but nothing to really freak out about.   I had to drop a star because of yesterday (Memorial Day) being kinda not great... it may have just been an off day since they don't usually do breakfast on Mondays so maybe the people weren't used to it... but half the trays were empty and not being replaced.... and half the trays there were repeats. Food was still good, but the chicken fried steak was never replaced so I didn't get any, there was not any sausage to be found in the building, or corned beef hash. Usually they have at least two different types of pancakes but yesterday they just had plain. They do have an omelet station which is great though and they had some good grits too. The lunchtime desserts are always good... banana cream pie, chocolate cream pie, cheesecake, lava cake, and a soft serve machine. Plus brownies, cookies, puddings, and so much more.   So for now they'll be at 3 stars... we'll see how things go next time to see if I can move them up or have to move them down."}
{"text":"Girlfriend says we won't come here again. Carpet smelled. Raw baked potato, over cooked baked fish,fried chicken salty."}
{"text":"Well it has been a little while since I have been here for lunch or dinner. I did come here for a networking meeting about 6 months ago and that was pretty good, but I didn't pay anything for it, but would have. My girlfriend and I ran in here the other day and wish I would have went to Golden Corral, but didn't have the time. There is really no selection and it hasn't really changed in 10 years or so. The manager was sitting at the table as you walked in and talking to a few people, one who used some foul language. The waitress was actually great though, I did tip her well for her service. The quality of the food was ok, but just not the selection or quality of Golden Corral and they charged us $23 for both of us for dinner with 1 soda and a water with 2 dinners. I just don't think you can compete with Golden Corral, so don't charge their prices. Keep up the good breakfast though."}
{"text":"Went in this morning for breakfast. They had omelets that are cooked to order, waffles, pancakes, bacon, sausage, biscuits, cinnamon rolls, cereal bar, milk, juices, and the whole works. There was a huge variety of food and totally awesome for only $4.99; however, drinks were extra like a buck something...definitely still worth it all.  On Sundays it goes from breakfast to dinner at 11am so I got the best of both worlds. Soon the fried chicken, Alfredo pasta, fish, mashed potatoes, pilaf rice, etc all came out.   Most unique thing is the grilling section. They served steak cooked to your liking, BBQ ribs, carved turkey and ham. They also have a seasoning section with their own steak sauce, A1, hot sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic salt, and all kinds.   I know I probably missed to mention a few things, but there's just too many to write it all down.  It was extremely busy when I arrived, but I got seated fairly quickly. Service was great! Workers were friendly and delightful. I would definitely come back...personally I think this beats Hometown even though their from the same family."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and to be honest it just lacks a lot. The food is okay, nothing fancy. Concerned that food is not very fresh some times. Lacks service a lot, especially if you come in when the northerner's are here."}
{"text":"Allow me to break it down.  Arrive at a boofay and pay at 8:37pm (per receipt).   After taking a seat and gathering drinks, proceed to boofay tables to commence face stuffing selections.   Notice a lot of usual items absent or severely depleted. Ask Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy at cash register what time is closing time. When he replies 9pm, but you may continue to eat until 9:30, I confirm that they will continue to replenish food items up until 9pm, otherwise I want to get refund and forget it, there's not enough time. He assures that they'll continue cooking and asks me to simply inform him of any missing items.   I do -- two main entree items that they advertise as 'signature' items. I wait around for the items they're supposed to be cooking, all the while watching as other dishes become emptied and are not refilled.   I ask about the original two, and one of these other dishes, and Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager goes in the back and comes out to tell me they aren't cooking anymore.  I relay to him my previous convo with Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy and say what gives?   After checking with Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy in a mysterious back office location, Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager informs me that it has been decided that it's not appropriate for me to receive a refund in this situation and there's nothing he can do. I remind Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager that I paid by credit card, and if I truly have not received the goods that I paid for, I'll just file a dispute with them.   He goes in the back again. (am I buying a car, here, or what?) Upon return, Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager presents me with a business card, on the back of which Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy has hand written a note entitling me to one (1) free adult boofay at any time of day. There were three of us in the party, and apparently Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy has decided that since I'm the only one complaining then I must be the only one who deserves a free meal credit.  Poor customer service has made me second guess my love of cheap ass boofays.  I guess i'll just stick with my nasty indie china boofays and avoid this WalMart of Culinary Mass Volume all together."}
{"text":"Big chains are important to submit reviews for. Even though the biz would have you believe that it  means you'll get consistent product and service across their multitudinous locations, has this ever been the case?  Even Taco DingDong taco meat is spicier in Phoenix than it is in Detroit.  This Old Timer's Boofay is run sublimely compared to the metrocenter location. The service level and the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen is drastically in a different league.    Food is still pretty generic - lot's of starches and cheeses and such to fill you up.   There seems to be a bit more pride of execution here.  Yeah, I know, it's a chain buffet, practically a cafeteria.  No matter.  What many folks don't realize is the amount of food dishes in a place like this that are prepared in a traditional, homestyle way.  Things like homemade salad dressings, madaroni and cheese casseroles, etc.  They do it to save money.  Reult is fresh, homestyle food for you. So they made it in a batch to serve 30 families, so what.   Breakfast is the real deal here, and around $6 if you skip the overpriced drink. Huge selection of all the favorites, and they're busy enough that it stays fresh.  I can't wait to be old enough to get my seniour discount here.  Inside of this svelt, healthy body is trapped the wrinkly, grumpy soul of a 68 year old man.    You kids get the hell off my lawn."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of buffets. So, why did I go here? The in-laws.   Basically if you want to eat a ton of food for cheap, this is your place! Yes, they have a large lunch selection, and lots of drink choices, but that is all this place has going for it.   So, I see pizza, and I think, pizza, they couldn't possible screw that up! Wrong! It made frozen,  cheap totinos pizzas taste like gourmet. MMMmmm, chicken strips. Wrong again. How did they get them so salty?"}
{"text":"We just visited this place a couple of days ago and I think it was horrible.  Quickly I realized it was just like a hometown buffet restaurant.  They could've done a better job of keeping the place clean.  But what made it worse was the people that were there.  There were a few people walking around with food all over them and touching the food with their hands.   We will never go back again."}
{"text":"This place is getting nastier every time I come the food is old, like they had the chocolate mouse cake and it was so dry and hard, there was also some flies buzzing around inside , the one by arrowhead is a little better"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been customers for several years. We are both senior citizens. We like to visit \"Old Country Buffet\" for the senior citizen pricing specials 1pm-3pm during the week. Excellent variety of food and beverage selections offered. Great service by all restaurant staff and management. Thank You!  Robison family."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down.  If you plan to go there and check it out for yourself, I highly recommend that you take your own plates, silverware and glasses. I searched for a very long time, for a clean plate and silverware.  It's like they must be using cheap dish washer detergent that doesn't quite rinse from items and leaves streaks, smears and dirt.   I was also surprised to find that the food was cold, despite being under hot lights.  This almost killed my appetite and I found myself looking for a microwave, to no avail.  The macaroni and cheese was watery and reminded me of Kraft boxed macaroni, along with being possibly mixed with cheese soup.  The pizza was bland, and the fat hadn't been pulled from the fried chicken.  The cantaloupe tasted bland, although the nachos were crisp and you were offered a variety of fillings, i.e. refried beans, hamburger, cheese, etc. The chicken nuggets were ok, if that's your thing.  The short ribs, while seasoned nicely, had very little meat.  It was like eating neckbones.  The best thing that I ate were the beef stew and a side serving of strawberry covered bananas.  The meat was tender, not too stringy and tasted marvelous. I was disappointed with the cheese cake, as it reminded me of jello.  I would've tried something else, but was stuffed after sampling a little bit of everything.  Overall, I was surprised there weren't better and more plentiful choices. I expect a restaurant's food to taste better than what I make at home.  Sadly, this was not the case and I felt that the price paid $11.29@ was exorbitant. Thank God I didn't opt for the soda (an additional fee), as I've grown tired of sugary replicas.   The waitress was courteous and overwhelmingly helpful, although since I fixed my own plate, what else did she have to do other than clear empty plates? I didn't expect to have to tip for that.  The bathroom was clean and no lingering odors were prevalent.   The parking lot was clean and ample spaces were available."}
{"text":"This place needs to be shut down. The bathroom looks and smells like it hasnt been cleaned in months. The food looks like it has been sitting there for days. I watched the guy change out a tray and he droped it in to the steam table water, then pulled it out dumped the water into the old pan and put the food out to serve. I left right then. 15 dollars down the drain. I wish i coul post the video here. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I came here because I got a \"buy one and a drink, and get a buffet free\" coupon for my birthday.  Sign up with their email newsletter and you will get your free coupon every year like me.  My mother has an obsession with buffets, and I finally decided to come with her to an American one.  Overall, this American buffet was impressive.  It had a wide variety of foods and lots of drinks and desserts to choose from.  I especially liked how they had their own Icee machine and their salad bar was fresh.  The customer service was also good too.  After eating a plate, someone was ready to pick it off my table."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!! Me and my little family came to have dinner last Saturday and Sunday woke up with symptoms of food poisoning! I was generous enough to ask for my $$ back but the owner Jeff would NOT give me a refund! Not only is this place dirty, the buss lady that was to be incharge of our table was sitting in a booth chit chatting with a customer laughing and touching her face while our plates piled on the table! Seeing my kids with vomit and diarrhea symptoms was enough to get me going nobody should have to go through that! What makes it more interesting Jeff will not give me a refund but, will invite us back again??? NO THANKS!!!!"}
{"text":"Typical buffet, assorted bland food nothing special to write about :( One good thing, soft serve ice cream  That alone earned them the third star."}
{"text":"What I paid for wasn't worth the food that they had the quality of food was very poor and the prices are outrageous I will never be back I would rather go to Golden Corral"}
{"text":"If you have no taste buds then this place is for you. The food was bland to a point of discusting.  The choices were few.  If I were to compare this place with Golden Coral I would tell you to go to the latter you may pay a little more but you will get taster food."}
{"text":"Not a very good selection. Food is bland. Taco meat was the best thing I had. When in the area, will not be dining there again."}
