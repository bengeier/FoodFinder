{"text":"I hate to give this such a low rating, but I ate here last week for the first time in over two years and before that we would eat here over 4 times a week - it was THAT GOOD! I always loved the church street burger, just amazing. BUT... Obviously there have been some major changes. Noone was there to greet us as we walked in, went up to the bar and had to ask if they were serving food... Staff was not friendly at all, and... my heart sank when I took the first bite of my church street burger that I had been longing for... Bread was old, fries weren't cooked all the way, cheese tasted like that shredded Kraft cheese you get out of a bag, and to top it all off... There was LITERALLY a solid 4\" diameter by 3/4\" thick slice of red onion on the thing... Enough onion for TEN burgers.... I was vastly disappointed in how the quality has gone soo far downhill. Unfortunately... I won't eat here again unless some major changes are made."}
{"text":"\"They had next to no drafts, barely any liquor and the place was vacant. Our group only came here because ziggys was full. My shot had 3 dead fruit flys in it. I could see in the kitchen and the sanitation was sub par. I wouldn't come here again if u paid me!\""}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! They used to have the best wings in town but over the years the food and servers took a crap. the food, including the legendary wings are terrible! the servers are slow, rude, and inconsistent. save your taste buds the pain and go to Ziggy's. P.S. its been ten years Jay, can fix the damn bathrooms!"}
{"text":"The beer battered fries are great, the $8 beer pitchers are nice, and the free pool tops it all off!"}
{"text":"Finally GONE!  This place went downhill over the past several years, even with the half-ass facelift.  Worst bathrooms on earth, and the wings sucked for years.  Put something good in there with TV's from this century."}
{"text":"This place is CLOSED! And I am glad that it is Closed! It has gone downhill and the owners are very irresponsible where they even would run out of beer because they didn't pay their bills. Amherst is a better place without that place there."}
{"text":"They have the best burger in the world!  \"The Church St Burger\"    I would give it 5 stars but the service is non-exsistant.  Basically just warm bodies serving food!  Apparntley the servers here do no understand that disgruntled customers can cost you a lot more than merely losing them as repeat customers.  Especially in these this tight economic environment, consumers are focused on getting good service.    I brought a group of friends here for dinner the other night......They raved about the Church St. Burger.  We had a few rounds of drinks, enjoying each others company by the cozy fire place in the dinning area!  The server had a hard time refilling our drinks.  She finally did come by and threw the check down and said is it ok if I cash you out.  Normally I would put her in place and request a manager but I just did not feel like waisting my time or money.  She wanted her tip before she left.  I said not to give her one for being such a dumb #$%% but my husband insisted on giving her %20  lets just say she is lucky I did not have the tab.  We left......Probably would of ordered 4 more rounds......It's ok we went somewhere else and spent our money.   so my advice to you is if you order the burger get it to go, they do not deserve a tip!  it is a good place to watch sports, but you get treated like crap.  They just got a new lobster claw!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the previous review.  We were asked to go here by some good friends.  The food was very good.  We all got boneless wings and they were crisp and tasty.  Beer specials were great!   Service .... Meh!"}
{"text":"The food is inconsistent and over priced.  I found feathers on my wings and the bartender looked at me like that was normal.  The bar was out of pretty much every topshelf liquor.  From what I hear that is normal.  I might go back if everywhere else is closed."}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone would come here when Ziggy's is 20 steps away. Food is ok, but it is mostly fried bar food. Burgers are best bet and wings are decent, but very expensive. Beer is not cheap and specials are lacking. And as the other reviewers have mentioned, the service is non-existent. Not only that, but management is worthless here and thinks they own this town. Bring back Tommy's or Pockets or anything else that was in this location previously."}
