{"text":"The Saint probably deserves 4 stars but I'm going to reserve that update until I go back for brunch.  Came here in March with a group of 10 for a friend's birthday. They had our table ready on time and we were greeted with bread and a request for drink orders promptly which was nice. I had my usual vodka soda and it was not skimpy on the vodka.  I wasn't starving that night so I went for the pierogi appetizer as my main dish. It was a nicely presented dish, 4 pierogis generously stuffed with pork belly and cheddar, served with cabbage and an herbed sour cream. It was flavourful but quite greasy, both the outside of the dumplings and the filling inside. I am not a huge pork belly fan (too fatty) so that was probably part of the problem, and my fault completely. The cabbage and sour cream were really delicious.  Most of our table ordered the fried chicken with mac and cheese and hot sauce, I had a few bites and it was very tasty. I liked the hot sauce addition a lot, could have been a bit more heavy handed. The mac and cheese was very creamy but could have been a bit cheesier in my opinion. Still, a very nice upscale version of classic comfort food.   I am very intrigued by the brunch menu and some of the other reviews so I will be back. The ambiance and the decor of the restaurant I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Went to the Saint on Saturday for brunch.  It was super reasonable and very yummy. Most of us had the prosciutto wrapped asparagus with poached eggs and a potato croquette type thing. It was really good - came in a cast iron skillet. Thought it might not be enough food but it was. Another friend had the standard eggs and bacon / sausage breakfast and her portion was great and bacon and home fries were very tasty. To top it all off, most of these dishes averaged $10 / $11 which is super reasonable for brunch that is not in a diner style environment. Would definitely make a return visit."}
{"text":"Decent place for a drink and a bite to eat.  I found the dinner menu selection somewhat limited. I had the friend chicken which was good but nothing spectacular or unique. Beer selection is decent.   I liked the atmosphere - clean, not overly loud, definitely good for a group."}
{"text":"The Saint has a great retro look inside, but it's not trying too hard. It's as if you walked into the Senator or the Paddock the day they were built. Beautiful and clean. Not precious.  Great take on American bistro fare.  I've had the fried chicken twice and loved it. They have elevated fried chicken to something beautiful. The first time it came with fries, now it comes with a corn/succotash and cornbread side. It really works. This ain't no KFC.   Steak and fries is very good too.  Service was fast and constant."}
{"text":"I have been living in the neighbourhood for a while and this place is going down. The quality of the food is down, used to be fresh but recently they switch the burger meat to some fatty cheap quality one - restaurant not busy even on prime weekdays nights - perhaps some money problem for operation? perhaps can fight the competition on Ossington? Anyhoo, I will stay away from it and check other restaurants on Osington."}
{"text":"This five star review comes well-deserved. Been here 5 times and each time has been at the very least great. If you want normal pub food(burger/fries), it's among the best in the city. If you want something fancier (pork, lamb), those meals were on par with fancy French restaurants. The brunch is also excellent."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a group of people and had a great time.  It was one of the only places on Ossington that had some room available (we wanted to go to Foxley, but it was packed and there were six of us).  The oysters were great and the main was good, I just wasn't blown away by anything here.  On another note, my wife has been for brunch and said it is fantastic!!! Until I try it, my three stars stands."}
{"text":"Love the Saint. It's a great, versatile go-to that can match any sort of night you want - from drinks to snacks to a full dinner.   The menu offers a lot of selection and the vibe of the space is great. Slightly casual without being sloppy, it has just enough polish to prevent it from becoming pretentious.   The huge booths in the centre of the room are great and so is the back of the restaurant but for some reason I don't like sitting in the front (usually used for people having drinks and a snack).   Servers are always warm and friendly and since it's near our place we take people there a lot. Everyone has enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We had a female server who seemed friendly but was terrible at her job. We went there for Sunday brunch and asked for tea, and was told they had run out and someone was literally in the midst of running to Lakeview restaurant around the corner to fetch some more. Not usually the ones to complain, we waited patiently and gave her the benefit of the doubt of remembering. Of course we wanted the tea with our scones but it was clear our server had forgotten. When asked about the tea instead of apologizing she literally threw her hands up, rolled her eyes and walked away...as if SHE was more flustered by this forgetfulness than we were.   So 45 minutes after we had been seated, she brought us Darjeeling tea.......except we had asked for English breakfast. By then we were impatiently waiting for our breakfast, and she came by to tell us she was waiting for us to finish our scones before bringing our meal out...not necessary. Then she cleared our scones (even though we still wanted to munch on them), and we specifically requested that our favourite part of the dish - the toppings for the scones - be packed along with them. This was because the last time we were at The Saint they had neglected to do this. So how surprised were we when we got home and opened our take out container to realize they had forgotten...AGAIN!   So in one seating, this server forgot our tea, forgot the type of tea we ordered, gave us the WRONG tea (which should have been comp'd but we were charged for), cleared our scones before we were done, forgot our coffee refill which we had to ask for SEVERAL times, AND neglected to pack the one thing we were specific about wanting. My boyfriend and I never complain, and are usually very forgiving about minor mishaps in service (I have worked in the restaurant industry myself). But this was too much and ruined the whole meal for us. We really wanted to like The Saint, since it is local for us, and the food is good. But both times we were there, there was clearly issues with service. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Saint is a great stop on Ossington. First of all, we didn't have to wait 45 minutes for a table - win! Second of all, the cocktail list is fun, the bottled beer selection is great (draught offers less choice but the selections are good), and the food, excellent! We were here on a Thursday night for snacks and a drink after a long day.  We had the Perogies, which my SO exclaimed, repeatedly, were the best damn perogies he's had, anywhere. They are rich. Bacon that topped them was crispy and sweet, a treat.  I had the steak tartare, with chips and bread. Crispy capers are a nice touch, and when ate with the chips, the salt flavour makes the whole thing really stellar. The menu said it came with a duck egg, I guess it's mixed in, as I was expecting it to be topped with a runny egg. Not in my case.  We had the duck nuggets, which are exactly like the frozen nuggets you had as a child. I'm sure that was the intent, so I'll call it fun. Not as delicious as the other two dishes though.  We finished our night with extra calories. Fries, with the bone marrow aioli (re: MEAT MAYO) and a ruben sausage that I really enjoyed. In fact, I'm still thinking about that sausage topped with crispy breadcrumbs, served with a dijon and sauteed onions.   I'll note that although not on the menu, I ordered a negroni. My two drinks tasted quite different from one another, and were served with lemon instead of orange peel. Yes, this is SUPER picky of me, but I won't hold the non-negroni expertise against them since it was an off-menu cocktail order.  Great bar food, good drinks, lovely staff team. Don't wait for 45 minutes to an hour to eat on Ossington, hit the Saint and be happy."}
{"text":"The room is pretty, with the banquettes on the south wall looking really fun. We sat in the back area at a table for six. The service is great: friendly, helpful and well-informed. The food is competent. Not terrible, and not overpriced for Toronto, but also not special. The cheeseburger is mostly bun - when Barbara asked for it without the bun, the sad little patty was maybe 5-6 ounces. ($18) The pork secreto was a nice option -- not a cut you see most places. But it should have been simply seared on cast iron and seasoned: the thick brown sauce with onions it overwhelmed the natural gaminess of this lean cut. The other diners seemed to quite like their fish and chips and fried chicken, but weren't raving about it.  The drinks list and martinis were good, and the wine list is pleasantly deep and not overpriced: a 2005 red Bordeaux for $65 was good value and matched well with the food. So why only two stars?  Noise. It was better at the bar and the front of the room, but the tile walls, hard floors and ceiling and fairly loud music meant that (at a guess) the ambient noise level in our area was 90 dB most of the time, with stretches at 100-105 dB. Not only was it extremely difficult to hear our dining companions, but our ears actually hurt.  I am sure it would be much better at brunch, or not on a Saturday night. But for a Thu-Sat night dinner, I can't recommend the Saint, despite all the things it does well."}
{"text":"Dwarfed by other Osington pubs. The food quality has been declining steadily since it opened about 5 years ago, and it seems under bad management now."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night and the food and service were amazing. We got there when the restaurant was just starting to get busy and over the course of the night the place started to pick up. Our server was friendly, attentive, knew the components of every dish and made no pressures on us. The staff there is great in general.  I had salted cod fritters to start which were simply outstanding and my husband has Steak tartare which he said was great too. My salad nicoise was ok. Good but nothing to scream about. I wish I had fried chicken that my husband was eating which tasted incredible. There are a lot of things on the menu that I would love to have so we will be back again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: clean, modern, and cool.  Food: tasty. The $10 eggs your way (scrambled) with tasty potatoes and country loaf toast were spot on (hint: ask for jam for your toast). The highlight was the maple bourbon bacon. DELICIOUS.   Service: poor. I didn't mind that they had me put my \"outside coffee\" into their mug but did mind the misinformation given by the waitress. When I asked to upgrade my \"choice of pork\" to the maple bacon she said it would be 1.50$ more but the bill came with $4."}
{"text":"Been here at least 3 times-got a yelp account just to review here-service beyond awful -had 930 pm reservation didn't get seated until 1015...staff where very rude and felt like the didn't even care for my business... For an 18 dollar burger - I expect customer service....  Bottom line-food was very Ok, service disgusting (would have walked out if I could) and bar cocktails are rancid... I live in the hood and so many BETTER restaurants that are grateful for my service ....  Beware of hipster service-horrrrrrrrible...."}
{"text":"Nice hangout outside the traditional downtown Toronto food routine that so many visitors follow. It takes a bit of effort to go west from the center of T-dot but foodwise the area around Ossington Avenue is worth exploring. We choose Saints which is an Irish tavern and were happy we did. My personal recommendation is the cod which comes with hot and cold potatoes and a portion of light-roasted broccolis. The rest of the us had a whole chicken to share which promotes conviviality. They also have a delicious cider as food companion."}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant for the early brunch seating revealed a whole other experience than supper. The front half of the restaurant was flooded with natural Spring sunlight and young hipster fams, adding new character to the cozy yet modern tavern charm. Connective the bistro-style seating near the front, and a substantial dining room near the kitchen at the back is a long sexy zinc bar, luxurious curved black booths, and subway tiles lining the walls. I loved the vibe at brunch as much as at night- a perfect space for a range of occasions, including Mother's Day brunch.  Service was efficient, friendly and warm. It was exactly the kind of pace you'd seek at brunch. No one's waiting around for simple bacon and eggs, but you don't feel rushed out, either. Our server also made sure our coffees were topped up, and our water glasses were refilled as needed.   While The Saint didn't have any special prefixes or Mother's Day themed offerings that day, their regular brunch menu was enough to draw me in. For brunch, the options are divided into Starters (with TWO different types of bacon), Mains, Sides and a Brunch Mixed Grill to serve four. They also do six delicious morning-appropriate cocktails including classics like Bloody Caesars, Maries, and Bellinis and a few unique sippers like the Red Rooster with Tomato Juice, Beer and a Raw Egg. Now I know my mom likes tomato juice, beer and eggs, but together, at 10 AM, would have been a questionable choice- especially for me who had just endured a bachelorette party the night before. Thankfully, there were plenty of ways to help pep me up for the day- here's a peak at what Ma and the girls tasted.  Cappuccino  Definitely did the trick, especially after a long night of girlish-debauchery the night before.  Maple Bacon Doughnuts ($6)  When doughnuts also have a bacon theme, I obviously can't pass them up. These ones were insanely good. Served warm and fluffy, packed with a sweet maple custard and dusted in a bacon scented sugar that just added a little savoury edge to balance the sweet. Yum.  Breakfast Corn Dog ($9) Sausage Wrapped in Pancake Batter with Maple Syrup  Love this idea. Deliciously juicy sausage in a moist fluffy pancake. Obviously all pancakes should be eaten with pork like this.  Classic Verscht with Housemade Mustard and Pickled Shallots  An off-the-menu treat, this may have been one of the tastiest things I've eaten in a while. In my mom's words, \"Wow! It's incredible how something so simple can have so much flavour?\" Yep. Mom gets it.  Eggs Any Style ($10) Poached, Maple Bourbon Bacon, Mushrooms, Roasted Tomato, Lyonnaise Potatoes, Toast  Great value for $10! Eggs were cooked perfectly as requested, the potatoes were crispy and nicely seasoned and that bacon did not disappoint.  Duck Egg St. Benedict ($13) Smoked ham, Cheddar Biscuit, Bearnaise, Lyonnaise Potatoes  I loved the buttery moist biscuit beneath the luscious smooth béarnaise and salty ham. Really, why would anyone want an English muffin when you can have these biscuits?  French Toast ($14) Nutella Mousse, Blueberries, Rice Krispies  This was crazy good. The bread was fluffy inside with a beautifully caramelized crust that just soaked up the sweet tangy blueberries on top. But the star was really the satiny sweet mousse with the little crackle of the rice krispies garnish. Everything is better with nutella, but this was just crazy good.  The Saint proved itself once again a stellar spot for any time or day of the year- including a special event like celebrating the most important women in our lives!  They are open at 227 Ossington Ave. daily for dinner, and weekend brunch. For more information, or to make a reservation, check out their website or follow them on twitter."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch at 1:30 with a party of 7. The great thing about this venue is that it does have quite a bit of seating unlike some smaller brunch places, so it was a solid choice for that reason.  I shared the Duck Confit scramble and the French Toast with my friend, and also tried the blueberry donuts.  The donuts were disappointing - too dry, and barely any of the blueberry compote. Not a good balance. I thought that the Scramble and the Toast were both pretty solid (may have been too much Nutella w/ the French Toast for my liking), and the toast that the Duck Confit Scramble was served with was a little too tough as well. However, both dishes were reasonably solid staples.  It was hard to get our server's attention at times, but she was generally quite friendly and helpful.  Decent choice, but I would come here mostly on account of the spacious seating more than anything else."}
{"text":"Im not sure what's going on, @ the saint tavern ...Im embarrassed that Ive recommended it to many people and they have had terrible service experiences. It's a shame, when the food is good but the service is lacking."}
{"text":"Another great addition to the Ossington strip!  The menu consists of some traditional bistro fare including steak & fries and crispy duck leg, as well as other tempting items such as fried chicken and lobster & corned beef hash. They also serve brunch on the weekends (11am to 2pm), which I've heard is fantastic... maybe for my next visit!  What went in my belly:  Perogies ($11) - if there's one thing you're going to order from the Saint, it's gotta be the perogies. They're stuffed with pork belly (yes - pork belly!), topped with caramelized onions, green onions and smoked bacon (of course). If only all perogies were made this way...  Steak tartare ($14) - meat was finely chopped, seasoned nicely but overall just okay.  Not one of the best I've had.   Savoury Pie ($22) - changes daily, today's was the pork tortiere. Comes out piping hot in a large cast iron pan. The two of us packed about a third of it to go.. very comforting, filling and tasty.  Cauliflower & Bacon ($6) - Perfectly cooked and the bacon certainly didn't hurt. A great side dish I'd gladly order again.  Overall, an enjoyable experience. Solid food, good service and great cocktails!"}
{"text":"We were seated near the window which I liked because it was a rainny afternoon and the breeze was great to have and overall the restaurant looked a bit to dim if you sat in the back. The washrooms are very small I am 5'2 and I can feel that my head will brush against the ceiling if I were just a few inch taller.   Food-  Ordered the Duck Egg Benny $13 + Bacon and Egg$18  The Benny - Duck egg was so yumm, but it didn't have enough hollandaise sauce because the bottom of the Benny was not your regular muffin but something more like a corn bread which tasted good, but because it is more dry it soaked up the sauce which was already lacking therefore it made you want more it came with the Lyonnaise potato YUUMMY!  As for the Bacon and Egg - It came with a fried duck egg, Slice of homemade baccon ( i assume ) A bone in pork chop,something that seems like homemade spam, toast and home made sauce.  - The Bacon is GOOOOOOOOOD yumm yumm yumm -The Spam was my favourite !! it was so flavorful, not salty just right ! loved it -Fried Duck Egg was good cooked just right sunnyside up -The Pork Chop was not as great, it was actually not cooked thoroughly and you can still see the it bring pink and the meat was stuck to the bone.  We didn't complain about the pork chop and just advised our server that it was under cooked, but instead he came back and advised that the kitchen stated because the meat is cure that's why it would be pink. I know the kitchen will say that because I understand that cure meat  is pink even when cooked, but I'm sure I can tell the difference between cure and uncooked meat.  The menu on the website is not up to date !!!!!  Overall service is average, food is ok. I want to give a 2.5 star but I can't so I will bump it  up t a 3"}
{"text":"Second time to the Saint, first time for brunch. Last time had the burger and it was great.   Ordered the Nutella French toast and it's pretty good, two large slices of bread, with berry compote and whipped Nutella under it, for $14. I would have likes it to be a bit egg-ier. It was tasty but I will not be dreaming about it and am not compelled to return to try anything else.   My husband had the breakfast sandwich, with real fried egg, homemade sausage patty and a welcomed slice of processes cheddar, so definitely better than the Golden  Arches version. Home fried were good.   Friend we were with is a vegetarian, son didn't have many options. He ordered the omelette and they accommodated by subbing in mushrooms for the meat. Nothing to rave about.   Total bill for the above + 2 pints and 1 negroni tax, tip was $88."}
{"text":"This might be my favourite restaurant in all of Toronto! The best way to describe the food here is that it just tastes awesome without any pretension.    The Pierogi and reuben sausage appetizers were amazing and good to split with another person.  I had the slow cooked pork jowl as a main which was tender and delicious!  I've actually been here a few other times and had some dishes that aren't on the menu anymore that were also great but it seems like I always like whatever is on offer here.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Don't bother waiting for a table go straight to the bar! You'll get the best service and awesome drinks at the bar. And ladies they have a hook for your purse or jacket! I always order the cherry drink. It's super tasty! I order my favorite duck nuggets every time I come by here and cracklings. What not to love! Have never had dinner where unfortunately just stop here while waiting for a table else where. But I always arrive early just to make sure I get to come to the Saint for their amazing drinks before dinner."}
{"text":"****This review is based on service******  This was by far the worst service I've ever received as a customer. I had met my friends at this bar, so I was the last one to arrive at the table. When I arrived I greated the waitress with a \"good afternoon\", and she didn't say a word, got me a glass and poured me some water in a very abrupt manner. She just asks \"have you guys decided on your drinks?\" I don't know if she was having a bad day, but that wasn't our fault.   My friends decided to order a second round, but were still finishing their drinks. The waitress rudely takes their old drink and pours it into the recently ordered drink - mmm backwash.   I was hungry when I got here, but lost my apetite. We had an early night. For the absurd amount of money this bar charges clients, they should at least offer better service.   I've done waiting jobs, and as much as it sucks, it is the job you get payed to do, so suck it up buttercup!  I will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware, their brunch is a meat laden feast. If it walks on four legs chances are it'll end up on the Saint menu. Make sure you order a side of bourbon, black pepper, maple bacon. It'll change your life!  The decor is all dark wood and leather, very masculine and cozy and the service is always spot on.   Stiegl Grapefruit raddler on tap is a guilt free breakfast libation along with a small but interesting craft draft list."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at the Saint on a Sunday for their buck-a-shuck. We were told we could only order 6 per person so we ordered 30 to start. It took about an hour for them to come and by the time we were done, we were told they were all out.   They had a special on beers that night and when we ordered them, we could see them just sitting at the bar - our waitress didn't bring them over until they had been sitting there for a good 20 minutes.   We ordered order dishes - the fried chicken, the perogies, a sausage, a cheese plate, a beet salad. Everything tastes great but the portion sizes are quite small for the price.   Since it was my birthday, my friend bought a cake and the cutting fee was $15 - which is crazy since all they did was bring the cake out of the fridge. They didn't even bring me a knife to cut the cake with.   It's a shame the service was so terrible because I really enjoyed the food but then again, we ended up having to order a lot because the portions were so small that I doubt I'd go back."}
{"text":"Ridiculously expensive , 3 pirogues for 11 $ and 3 proves of salami for 7 $ , don't go there ! It has nice decorations but nothing out of the no for a Toronto bar, it has some screens playing sports. Fast and responsive staff but normally friendly."}
{"text":"If Sunday brunch was a religion, I would highly consider converting into it. Conversion to Sunday brunch would require you to accept the fact that you don't need to wake up early on Sunday, and therefore you can allow yourself to eat something that is heavier than just breakfast. Brunch brings to the table a few things that are worthy of worship such as eggs benedict, bagel & lox, and huevos rancheros. I love the concept as we usually have brunch with our friends, family, or loved ones; hence, brunch builds a sense of community. Jokes apart, going for brunch is one of the highest trends in the Toronto restaurant industry. In the past few months a few fine dining restaurants have added a brunch menu. I have a few favourites in the city but today I will focus on The Saint Tavern.  The Saint Tavern is located on Ossington St. near Queen St. West. We were a group of four and we arrived at the restaurant around 1:30PM. It was busy but we were lucky enough to get a very comfy table. The decor was modern and charming. Polished cement floors, old looking light fixtures, all black, white, and gray with a very-large-bar.  We started with the deviled eggs with chives, radish salad, and bacon. It was delicious and we were all fighting to get the last piece. I opted for having their grilled cheese sandwich with roasted tomatoes and salad. It was simple but perfect. The strong cheese was balanced by the tomatoes- so yummy! My friends loved their choices and we were all pleased with our waitress. I recall drinking copious amounts of coffee on that day and not eating ANYTHING ELSE after having that meal.   We spent a few hours at the restaurant and we had a great time! I would love to come back there for another brunch or maybe dinner one day. It feels good to be able to write a review like this one!"}
{"text":"Salt. This was by far the main ingredient in every single dish that was served. Been here twice and it's just painful to throw money away on food that leaves your lips withered with all.that.salt.   Prices are ok but the dishes are small, so if you're into comparing what you get for your dollar at random restaurants, this is not the place that offers quality culinary workmanship for your dough. And all that salt. That's literally all I remember from my last visit. It's just baffling how much salt was on everything. Ordered the entree with the home made sausage and I don't know how it tasted because the sausage and the adjacent vegetables were just too salty. Did I get my point across yet? Before you start thinking that I'm just a complainer that latched onto one small detail let me tell you that I greatly enjoy heavily salted foods like herring, salted dry fish, anchovies, all types of pickled everything, so I'm not a salt sensitive person but this was just CRAZY. Maybe a chef was pissed off or something and just sprinkled, rather, threw mounds of salt on everything because there is no reasonable explanation for all that goddamn salt.   The ambiance is very nice though and the decor is great too. All in all, as much as I want to wish the saint all the best, you're better off going somewhere else...."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the ambience was great, the bar and wine list extensive, and the service very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. A couple of dollars overpriced, in my opinion, but we enjoyed our meals. The scrambled eggs were done really well and everything came out hot (which isn't always the case with breakfast food)."}
{"text":"Had the pierogis, burger and fries chicken last night . Our helpful, attentive and funny waitress Meaghan recommended the pierogis and she wasn't wrong- the starchy dumplings were contrasted with caramelized onions, pork belly and shallots. Burger was cooked perfect with a relish sauce that made me think this is what a grown up Big Mac should taste like. Fried chicken was juicy and crispy, and you need to have it with its potato purée and pickled watermelon. Rotating draft and wine list locks me in as a returning customer"}
{"text":"My new fave place on Ossington. Unpretentious, this place has a relaxed vibe and the service was fantastic. I tried the perogies (maybe the best I've had), oysters (fantastic scotch bonnet and mango sauce), shrimp (best cocktail sauce I've had), and the fried chicken was delicious. The watermelon was a refreshing side. Hopf on tap, this place is great."}
{"text":"Food: delicious. Everything came out with such flavor. We finished each dish wanting more. The seasoning was perfect, the tenderness of the meat was precise and presentation was delightful.  Staff: everyone was great. Aside from being friends with one of the kitchen staff, we didn't see anyone unhappy. Our drinks were always refilled and always greeted with a smile.  Atmosphere: the place is a tavern. Its great for watching sports or just hanging with friends. Lots of drink choices."}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambiance. Adam makes a mean cocktail and shot and the buck a shuck Sunday's is not too be missed."}
{"text":"Excellent steak frites, fried chicken and brunch (though the brunch is very heavy). I love the ambiance, though the tile means things can get a little noisy when it fills up. Incredibly solid value for money, which is always nice."}
{"text":"Overall 7/10 -- good food but not memorable.   Attended this weekend with fellow diner. Had the perogies and baked cauliflower to start. Both were pretty good. Also had a couple of pints of beer which are on the pricier side of what beer goes for in this city.   Mains consisted of the trout and fried chicken. Both good but have had better of each respectively.   Won't oppose an invitation to return but not running back either."}
{"text":"Had some of the yummiest food in a long time at the saint! I had their burger, while my boyfriend dove into their steak....we left feeling so content and wanting to return as soon as we could make the room in our stomachs again. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Great gastro-pub! Amazing menu, food, beer, wine and cocktails."}
{"text":"We went in without a reservation but was seated almost immediately. I think we got lucky though.   This place is kind of in the middle of nowhere. Especially since I never go to the ossington area. Little did I know this joint is one of the newest addition to the neighbourhood.   We were starving. So we ordered their pulled-pork perogies before even sitting down. It was a hit! Probably the best perogies I've ever had. Our next appetizer, the salted cod fritters, also did not disappoint. I strongly recommend just trying all their appetizers. They were much more outstanding comparing to the mains.  Now the main. My friend had the duck leg. Really nothing special. But nothing's wrong with it either. I had the lobster hash. I was surprised of the large chunks of lobster in my dish. I think it was well worth the price. It was good, but it felt more like a brunch dish. Very carb heavy at 8pm at night.   We did also get cocktails and dessert. But they weren't outstanding, therefore I don't remember. I think the dessert was some sort of a cheesecake.   If I go again, I'm just going to get a glass of wine and all the appetizers."}
{"text":"Went to the Saint last night with 3 others and had a great time overall.  They have an excellent beer and wine selection, although I didn't terribly love the wine I had.  The atmosphere and decor is very cool and cozy, perfect for a cold night- try to get a booth if you can.  The food was very good.  Not great, but very good.  All of our snacks and starters were terrific, the duck nuggets, sausage, and perogies.  For our mains, 2 of us had salmon which was good if not a bit rich.  Another had pork shoulder which looked amazing.  I had a nicely cooked steak frites, which was delicious despite being a little chewy.    Overall, for the price, atmosphere and better than average food, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch. It was about 10:15 am and we were the first table there. We thought it was one of those uber popular brunches places that you had to wait an hour for. I guess it wasn't, but it certainly did not mean it didn't deserve to be!  We had an enjoyable meal here. Ordered the donuts, croque madam and duck egg benny.  The donut was glazed in a butter and maple sauce. It was 6 bucks for 2 regular sized donuts and was worth every penny. The donut was light and fluffy, not dense and the sauce was not too sweet.  The croque madam was served with a side of salad. The salad was a plain salad, just some lettuce and some vinaigrette. The croque madam was good, sunnyside egg on top was perfectly cooked. There was also a nice touch of Dijon mustard with the ham. The bread was light and fluffy as well, with a crispy/flakey crust. The sandwich tasted good but after a while, I noticed the top of my bread where the gruyere had melted was getting soggy. Not sure why that was the case. Still tasted good, minus the soggy top.  My husband ordered the duck egg Benny. The eggs were poached perfectly, runny inside. The duck egg tasted just like chicken egg. It was served on ham and cheddar biscuit. It was good but the cheddar biscuit was a little on the salty side. The lyonnaise potatoes on the side were delicious. Best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  The menu was reasonably priced and the portions were generous. Great place to check out if you're looking for a new brunch place outside of the usual places."}
{"text":"My beef dip sandwich of the day was drenched in mayo even though I asked for no mayo. Apparently the chef was calling it \"pommery\" so the waitress didn't know. Who would want mayo all over a sandwich served with gravy? Gross! My friend's beans were hard. Three of us spent $100 on unhealthy \"meh\" food and a round of beer. Atmosphere was unimpressive. Hated the tvs."}
{"text":"Great burger-probably one of my faves The pork chop/loin/collar with brussel sprouts was one of the best things Ive eaten in a while. Chef nailed that dish that day! Nice upscale pub type place with booths"}
{"text":"Food was great! I had always wanted to try The Saint because a friend had recommended a while back. I finally had the opportunity to go! In one line, I would say: order the pierogies for sure and do not order the fried chicken.   It was a a bit dark inside but the ambience was nice and the interior is beautiful... like a vintage/hipster/artsy pub with beautiful wood and dim lighting. It was just my friend and myself so we weren't completely sure how much food to order.   We ordered the pierogies and it was amazing. It was definitely our favourite dish of the night. The flavour was amazing - the sautéed onions and the sour cream sauce that went along with the dish just made the dish absolutely divine! We were pleasantly shocked since we were on the fence about the pierogies.   We also ordered the duck nuggets which were pretty good as well. The meat was nice and tender but tasted very similar to gourmet chicken nuggets. However, the dipping sauce was very unique and tasteful. It was a mixture of pineapple and southwest (?). The dipping sauce definitely made the dish. The cheesesteak tartare was also delicious but nothing spectacular. We decided to order an entree halfway through our apps.   We ordered the fried chicken. The fried chicken itself was very tasteful. The meat was tender, not too fatty but not too dry. The fried part was fresh (I find that some restaurants reuse their oil and the fried part tastes oily, but not the case at all). The only disappointment was the sauce. It was a bit bland; did not have much taste. The pieces of pickled watermelon helped but only slightly. I WOULD NOT recommend this dish and probably not order it again."}
{"text":"Saint Tavern for Winterlicious dinner - party of 10!   I've had a couple friends dine at Saint Tavern on more than one occasion (not Winterlicious) and have heard great things about this restaurant. It definitely did not disappoint.   The ambiance in the restau is nice. It is dimly lit - so all you foodie photogs, be aware that you will need your flash to snap a good pic! We were seated in the back of the restaurant which was fine. Our service was 100% and our waitress was very knowledgeable and on point the entire time we were there. Our menus were given once we were all seated and the time to take our orders was very efficient.  The transition from our starters and drinks (2nd-3rd rounds) to clearing of plates for our mains being served AND brand new utensils were seamless!   The food was awesome! I had the Beef Chuck - so wonderful! The meat was really tender and the seasoning was absolutely delicious! Not over salted, perfect. I even stole a couple fries from my friends who had the burger (also amazing!) - fries were perfectly salted and still hot so you know they were a fresh batch! Our table of foodies had zero complaints of the food AND service.   The only reason I gave Saint Tavern one less star is because of seating. We were originally a party of 12, but 2 could not make it.  If they both arrived, one of seating was very close to another table of 2. Where if my friend (empty seat) moved back, it would/could knock over the other tables food or drinks,etc. So spacing is quite key - but regardless............great food and great service!!! I would definitely come back and recommend others to come enjoy the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Just came here during poutine week. Great poutine. Tiny tables so be sure you're tiny too. Great service although it's very busy during brunch hours which is not surprising. I really want to return for their drinks and sit at the bar - old fashioned design and lots of hip people to oogle at."}
{"text":"Really great spot! Went there for Sunday brunch yesterday and was greeted by friendly service, no wait time, and a great menu. Try the scones - they're delightful with homemade jam and clotted cream. I had the stuffed french toast which was super decadent. Sorta more dessert-like than breakfast-like, but who's complaining?! Can't wait to try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"Have been here for brunch, dinner, and just drinks, I think my favorite was brunch because the omelette was so good but dinner isn't far behind. The food here is quite delicious, and creative while still being pub-y. $4 Caesars on a Saturday morning is fantastic, and the brew coffee is actually decent, which seems to be a hard thing to come by at restaurants these days. My friend had the Benny which I tasted and it's rich but damn it's good."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We went here for winterlicious so we did the prix fixe menu. Overall the meal was good, but the service was really slow. It was busy, but not THAT busy. I mean there were open tables the whole time and we were there from 6:30-8.  To start with I had the wedge salad. It was good, but a little weird--not your typical wedge salad. Wife had the potato soup and it was also good, but needed a little more flavor.  For my entree I got the fried chicken. This was the best part of the meal for me. So juicy! The pickled watermelon sounds questionable, but it was delicious! Wife had the cheeseburger, which she thought was just okay. Fries were great though!  We ended the meal with the chocolate pudding. It was so yummy, but super rich. Also had the sorbet and it was nothing special."}
{"text":"Fantastic Service,  Fantastic Food, Worth the $$$. Breakfast/Dinner are both great."}
{"text":"Brunch   Ambience: 4/5   Food: 3.5/5 (Notes: Coffee is amazing. Complementary refills).  Service: 3.5/5 (Friendly) Value: 3.5/5  Repeat: Perhaps"}
{"text":"We went to the Saint after not getting into the smaller Yours Truly next door (I wonder how many discouraged Libretto customers end up doing the same thing!).   I'm not the biggest fan of the decor in this restaurant. It's quite prepackaged and only 1 notch above the Keg in appearance. It felt a little cold and cavernous. The lighting was a bit bright and the white-white subway tiles didn't help the feel too much. Maybe with 10 years of wear it will get some more character.  Secondly, the service was pretty slow. We sat at the bar on a Sunday night with a half-empty restaurant. The drinks came in about twice the time they should have and the food was about the same. I didn't find the staff overly friendly or helpful in talking about the menu either. When I asked if the fried chicken was a heavy or light batter the bartender didn't know and just said, \"I do know it's a very popular dish\". I decided to try it anyway.  Thankfully the food was quite good. The chicken was tender and lightly battered with an even coating, just crunchy enough and very good seasoning. The mashed potatoes and bacon-chunk gravy were equally tasty and not overpowering. Finally the collard greens were perfectly cooked and a nice balance to the other flavours. For $20, great value and not far off my favourite, same-ingredients, dish at the Ace.  Overall this restaurant is A-OK as the 3 star rating suggests. The rest of the menu gets up there in price and the ambiance is a little sterile so I can't say that I'll be running back, but it's a solid place and if you're shivering in the cold because you got shafted at YT or Libretto, it's classier than going to Lakeview."}
{"text":"Everything is a little low grade. Service, food and drinks. It's a nice looking place but that would be it. Stay away from any cocktails, they're awful. Stick to wine and/or beer here. Be careful of bartenders with attitude."}
{"text":"I came to The Saint for New Year's Eve. What a great vibe it's got!   We went to the bar for a couple of drinks before being seated to dinner...  The menu is quite interesting, starters including pork belly pierogies, oysters, pâté and a cheese pot.   Mains include the southern fried chicken with mac and cheese, steaks, burgers and the lamb shoulder with eggplant/aubergine purée and parmigiana. That was delicious.  I tried my brother's surf and turf, including truffle mash and lovely green beans.   Sides, sausages and soups change on a daily basis as does the fish.   I really thought it was a cool place to eat-not too young or full of jerks trying to show off. The staff were also very friendly and very informative.   I'm looking forward to coming back to Toronto and trying out the fried chicken."}
{"text":"I've been to The Saint for brunch a couple of times now and it's been great.   The prices are good and you get quite a lot of food. The two eggs with pork, mushrooms, tomato and lyonnaise potatoes are delish and usually more than I can finish. Friends have had the french toast and loved it and the plates of donuts going by always look spectacular.   The service can be a bit slow but on Sunday mornings when hangovers abound it can be forgiven. One of the best parts about brunch at The Saint is that they take reservations so you don't have to wait in a giant line!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pass on the fries (soggy) but make sure to try the char grilled bacon. Duck rillete was good too. Nice ambiance. Will definitely go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner experience! Cool vibe and decor, very respectable wine selection (including special wines imported from small wineries in Italy),  amazing steak, and very thoughtful, attentive service. Tomahawk chop was phenomenal, as were the stuffed mushrooms and the loaded potato (and the pirogies we had as the starter for that matter). Most of the food was served in cast iron skillets, which was a nice touch. The waiter was unbelievably helpful - his recommendations turned out to be exactly what we needed. All in all, great restaurant - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New menu. Duck wings and drumsticks were great. Burger was good too. House ketchup is skanky, so ask for Heinz with your fries."}
{"text":"Death by salt, or as a previous review described it \"eaten alive by the salt monster\". http://danielberkal.yelp.ca    That monster got me too.  But before the salt, there was the watered down gas station coffee. It was terrible. None of us at the table could finish our cups. We overlooked it and thought, hey, we're here for food, but if you can't make a simple cup of coffee...  My review is for Sunday Brunch.  Three of us ordered the Croque Madame and the other two ordered the Duck St. Benedict. The benedicts were good (I didn't try). I was unfortunate enough to have ordered the Croque Madame. If you've ever had one, it's meant to be creamy and easy on the palate. The Saint Tavern uses a very sharp aged cheddar, beef pastrami and a duck egg. The bechamel-like sauce was lost in the overpowering salty harshness of the cheese. In fact all flavours were lost to that cheese and the very thick slices of brioche. The pastrami alone was actually really good. We were very disappointed. The dish came with a side of arugula (no dressing) and pickled fennel I believe it was. The other two had radishes in their salad. I didn't see any on mine. The arugula helped a little with balancing out the flavours but none of us could finish our meal.   2 stars for friendly and courteous service and nice decor."}
{"text":"I have a new love and their a saint.. Er rather it's called The Saint.   I have been The Saint now twice and both times I left, I raved about the food for a days after. The first time I had Oysters an then the Steak Frites and the second time I had the Salt Cod Fritters and then the fried Chicken. All of these things were pretty amazing and with incredibly friendly and knowledgeable service, this place is ace in my books.   The first time I went, we had reservations ahead of time and the table was ready and waiting and the second time, we just walked in and they found us a spot immediately even though they were packed solid. There was never a delay in wait time for the food and it all came out cooked to perfection.  the atmosphere is cozy and inviting and yet has a classier look than your average tavern.  I highly suggest, that if you haven't gone yet, that you do. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The fried chicken is the best I have ever had- that coating=wow!  We also nibbled on warm olives, duck nuggets, and the soup of the day - all of which were fantastic! Now, it is very pricy so keep that in mind. If you want nice ambiance and to splurge a little , give this place a whirl. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a group of friends. The food was excellent, the atmosphere was great as well. They were quite busy for brunch and we had to wait a loooooong time for our food. We got seated at 1pm and didn't get our food until 2:45. mind you, we were drinking and nibbling on scones and such but a few of us were REALLY hungry and got a little irked about this. The restaurant did apologize and comp us on the food- which i thought was very nice.   The food: this is what's really important right? We literally had everything on the menu and no one complained about the food. I had the poached eggs and the asparagus and it came with a delicious potato croquet which I LOVED. The kitchen was probably in a bit of a chaos because some of our food came out lukewarm and my poached eggs were well done (the yolk was completely cooked and hard instead of runny). But taste wise? Everything was really delicious.    Even though I caught them on a bit of an off afternoon, I would totally go back because the food was delicious and the management acknowledged (and apologized and comped) for the short comings."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for meat eaters!!! Really great bang for your buck! I got stuffed after our brunch! Their drink specials are delicious for standards pricing but well worth it! Service was very attentive friendly and on pointe the entire time. I highly recommend the grits and gravy flavours and quantity was Sooo amazing. The  decor is really funky and there is plenty of seating options. Shout out for their music playlist I was singing almost the entire meal"}
{"text":"I recently realized that I've written a lot of 4 Star reviews of 1 Star places. So I figured why not write a 1 star review of a 4 Star place? Please find below:  Went here Saturday night on a HOT double date. Everything was good.  What did we have? NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"I'm a curse!  Apparently, if I give a place a good review, it immediately disintegrates.  Sorry, guys, for taking away all the good ones.  Went for brunch around 1:30 today.  Now, service was good, water refills and coffee refills efficient.  But some things were just strange.  First, we both take milk and sweetener in our coffees.  They gave us one pack of Sweet n Low on the side of our coffee cups - so with refills, I had to ask for more.  Why didn't they just bring us a little cup of sweeteners?  Even the most dingy places do that.  Second, it took 35 minutes for our food to come out.  That's a long ass time.    When I got my food - I always get the same thing, steak and eggs - it was different than any other time Ive gotten it.  Everything was smaller.  I saw other people's steak and eggs coming out of the kitchen, and they got toast - I didn't get any toast.  For $18, I got two eggs, a handful of fries and some pieces of over salted steak.  Not impressed.  Plus, it's supposed to come with sauce and I had to inquire about it, which was weird.  My friend got a mostly empty plate, too, even though I saw other people's food plates coming out of the kitchen covered in potatoes, etc.    The server kept asking us at the end, \"Did everything taste ok? It tasted ok for you?\" and things of that nature - like he was expecting it shouldn't have tasted good.    For the money I spent, I was super disappointed.  Very, VERY sad about this one."}
{"text":"Good Food. The fried chicken is 3  of 5 stars. Piergo is great.  Corned has 3 of 5 stars.  Pot pie 4 of 5 stars.  Hostess sat us even though they had hour wait for other tables so i thank you for that!"}
{"text":"We parked to have a desperate \"Hangry Brunch\" at the Lakeview, which I'm really not a fan of, but extreme measures were necessary. The wait was 30 minutes and we couldn't do it. We would have killed one another.  Having already paid for parking, we ventured down Ossington in search of... pretty much anything. Happily, we wound up at The Saint and we were very glad, indeed. There was no wait for a table. Awesome. The first time I'd been to the Saint, I found it overpriced and the servers to be heavy on the hipster ennui.  This time, I had the BEST BACON OF MY LIFE.  Yes, this was the very best bacon I've ever had. And it came in one fat strip on my Brunch Salad. Perfectly rendered, thick as a two by four and wonderfully smoked, I was in love.   I would come back here just for the $5 Caesars and a plate of that goddamn bacon.  In other news, the Benny was enjoyed by my boyfriend. He liked the cheddar biscuit, and the hollandaise was great. The ham nestled in between was a bit of a disappointing portion, but overall, very tasty.  Service was good. The Bacon was better.  Bacon.  That is all."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and it is one of my top 3 restaurants in Toronto. Their duck nuggets are must try. They're like chicken nuggets but infinitely better. Crispy, juicy and magical. Yes, this place is pricey but the food is definitely worth it. I went with a group of friends and we just ordered a pile of appetizers and it was one of the best meals of my life. They're brunch is really good too, especially the duck confit scramble. The cocktails here are good but too expensive in my view. Stick with simple drinks for the value. Chef Jesse Vallins really cares about quality ingredients and he's won the the Sausage League competitions a bunch of times. Dishes to try: duck nuggets, pierogies, fries with bone marrow aioli, duck confit scramble, pork jowl (super tender)"}
{"text":"Great comfort food restaurant on the ossington strip.  Impossible to miss with the cool white tiling outside (and inside).  The cheeseburger is amazing.  It's on the pricey side for a burger, but probably one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever hard.  The savoury pie which was beef and vegetable and dangerously rich and delicious.  I also ordered brussel sprouts on the side with bacon thinking these would be \"healthy vegetables\".  I'm confident I ate the equivalent of a night at the CNE in calorie count in just the sprouts, and it was well worth it.  They also have a good selection of local craft brewers.  Brunch menu was also intriguing.  Tip: They have $1 oysters on the weekdays that come with three different homemade sauces."}
{"text":"A duck-themed Sunday brunch with duck eggs and duck meats everywhere to the delight of my dining companions (duck eggs benny especially) and I had the basic breakfast, which hit the spot (fried potatoes especially), plus several French 75s that went down so smooth we promptly left the restaurant and made a beeline to Metro to pick up lemons so we could make them at home and we continued enjoying them at a dangerous pace until I went to bed at 7:30pm."}
{"text":"I got the cheeseburger. The patty was waayyyyyy oversalted, but the relish and aioli were good. Fries were OK.  Husband got the chili dog special, which was a sausage with some pretty good chili on top.  Beer selection was ok, nothing unusual or outstanding.   Overall, it was ok, but you pay Ossington prices for meh food."}
{"text":"I love the saint for brunch! It's great food (heavy but great) and a really casual, lazy Sunday feel to it with an upscale decor. Staff is super friendly always and it has a great bar for to sit at on your own. $5 amazing Caesars and mimosas at weekend brunches are hard to turn down."}
{"text":"We were initially out hunting for oysters on Sunday. But just when we thought our luck had run out for finding a place that didn't need a long wait time, we saw a sign outside The Saint that mentioned \"buck a shuck\"! We gave it a shot and walked in.   Unfortunately, when we were seated, our waitress mentioned that they had run out of oysters for the day (this was at 8 pm, and the deal starts at 4). Disappointed that they didn't point this out initially, we decided to try out the food fare anyway.   We had the pierogi (pork belly), saint cheeseburger, and the fried chicken. The food was pretty standard - nothing outstanding.   We got 3 pierogies for 11 bucks, which was disappointing to say the least - especially when it seemed like Yelp pictures showcased varying amounts of pierogies (from just 2 to 6)... Maybe they judge your party size and give you however many pierogies they think you'll need? Regardless, it was not worth the price in our opinion.   The cheeseburger was good, but it was very standard. The fried chicken was the best, but that seems very hard to mess up.   All in all, I would not run to this place again... Because we got the runs after. We think it may be the sour cream... But something was not right with our food.  Otherwise, service was acceptable, and atmosphere was nice. Food = no go. I'll try out the many other places on ossington next time."}
{"text":"Okay, I was in a state of increasing inebriation while I was here, but I really enjoyed the atmosphere, choice of drinks and the service. For one thing, my friend spilled an entire pint of beer on me, and they were quick with napkins and a half pint for her.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great for brunch! Duck egg benedict and drinks will not disappoint.  My experience here was quite good. The restaurant was clean, appealing, and not too crowded. Opentable is a plus when making reservations for brunch. Service is pretty average - not excellent, but also not bad. The 4 star rating is mostly based off of the food and drink.  Upon arrival, I noticed the sign for $5 mimosas and $5 caesars. Yes please! The brunch menu ranged from $11-$18, but most of them were $11-$15, I would say.  For $5, the mimosa and caesar was very good. They did not water down the alcohol or anything, and the caesar was sooo delicious. I'm not a drink expert, but I do think they did their caesars right!  Duck egg benedict: $13, this was a generous portion. I really liked how instead of using a typical English muffin, they had some sort of cheese biscuit / cornbread. It was a very delicious alternative to the English muffin that I actually don't really like. The potato hash was also quite good - it was well seasoned, not too salty, not dry, and had onions. The hollandaise sauce was sooo good on top of the perfectly poached egg. And the salty piece of ham was a generous size that matched perfectly to the rest of the benedict. The only thing is, this dish is quite heavy and filling so if you like something less so, perhaps try something else on the menu!  Overall, a great experience. I might go again, but none of the other brunch menu items seem particularly enticing for me to go all the way over there a second time!"}
{"text":"Great vibe (very hipster though), and good (but expensive) cocktails.  I love the little moscow. I haven't yet found a moscow mule done better anywhere else.  I'm a salt-lover so this place tastes just right to me, but the chef definitely likes to pack on the salt. I think the food is consistently excellent. I've tried the steak tartare, duck nuggets, spicy pickles, grilled bacon, bread and butter, oysters, perogies, wedge salad and fries. I'll try and give you a quick overview of the menu items I've tried.  Note that the steak tartare has since been replaced with the \"cheesecake tartare\", which substitutes the duck yolk for provolone aioli. I can't say I'm a fan of the new rendition.  The duck nuggets, are great. If you like chicken nuggets you should like these- they're a gourmet version.  The spicy pickles are really excellent. They might not sound like much, but they are really good.  Grilled bacon was very salty, but if you're like me and like thick-cut bacon and salt, you'll like this.  Bread and butter was exactly what it sounds like. A lot simpler than I was expecting. I wouldn't order it again.  The oysters are a great deal on Sunday (buck-a-shuck). They were really good. Lately I've been getting about 2 bad oysters per dozen, which I don't complain about because I only order these on Sundays.  Perogies were alright to me. From reading the reviews, there are a lot of big fans. I'm personally not one of them, but to each his own!  The wedge salad is good. Bacon bits were really yummy.  Fries come with \"fruit ketchup\" and bone marrow aioli. Both sauces are really, really good. I don't know what fruit is in the \"fruit ketchup.\" It tasted like a really good house ketchup to me. Would definitely order these again.  I don't know what you guys are ordering to put this in the \"$$\" category. I think \"$$$\" is a more accurate price-range to expect.  Disclaimer: I'm writing this review late. I haven't been here in a number of months so some menu items may have changed."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed with The Saint today. Have had great experiences there before but today went for brunch with bunch of girlfriends. In the first 5 minutes at our booth, the waiter dumped two full mimosas on my friends lap. She was soaked!! After mumbling a sort of apology and getting towels the waiter proceeded on like nothing happened. No offer of free drink, nothing. We then proceeded to wait well over an hour for our food. In all we were there over 2 hours, my friend now dryish with sticky clothes. Got the bill full price, with not a \"thanks for being a good sport\" or nothing from the waiter to my friend who really was very good about the whole thing. Not much of a Saint today I'm afraid."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for brunch and it really hasn't been so great. Chef would only make pouched or scrambled eggs. Which is kinda ridiculous when you are paying such high prices. And it's brunch. I want some damn fried eggs. So we ordered pouched eggs and they were hard boiled.  Also shared the grits and gravy. Absolutely no flavour.  Food also took 40 minutes to be served.  The best thing here is the maple bourbon bacon, however, eat it quickly or It will turn into a sugary rock."}
{"text":"After being told Libretto would be an hour wait, we took our chances with the nearby Saint. We were able to get a table fairly quickly. We went for dessert after a filling meal somewhere else. The chocolate cake was sinfully delicious. My mouth craves it right now as I type. Our waiter was nice but a little quiet and forgetful. It took him awhile to get over to us and after my friend asked for no cream with her coffee, he still brought cream. It was a busy night though so I'll chalk it up to him being busy.  Bonus: I ended up leaving a pair of gloves here and the front door staff were great at finding it and putting it away for when I did realize they were lost."}
{"text":"I just had brunch for the very first time here, and it was a fantastic experience. To start, we got the scones. For $4 you get 4 warm and fresh scones with butter, Devonshire cream and homemade jam on the side. To me that's a great deal and it is so tasty.  We got eggs benny, the French toast, and two eggs any style. The portions were extremely generous and the sides were all delicious. The potatoes were not greasy at all, very crispy, and came with caramelized onions. Everything we had was done just right. They have a pretty big brunch menu so I'll definitely be coming back to try more!  The service is some of the best I've ever had for a brunch. Everyone was really friendly and on top of making sure your coffee and waters are filled. You can tell that this team really knows what they're doing and have fine dining service experience.  So happy this place is open for brunch. I highly recommend it over some of the other places in the Dundas/Ossington area that have big lineups, aren't nearly as delicious or have as good service, and are comparably priced (you know what I'm talking about....)."}
{"text":"This place is very bland and uninspiring considering the price of the food. My fried chicken set atop a blob of macaroni and cheese and coleslaw (I think) was oily and flavourless. My partner's skirt steak was pretty, but chewy and unsatisfying. The place was just empty and cold. I would try it again for brunch, however. I could see some potential there."}
{"text":"Mondays - $1 Oysters! @thesainttavern  You can't get better than that. +1 star for the promo  The food here is quite good, substantial and priced well for this trendy neighbourhood.  Borderline pub and gastro pub, their most adventurous ingredient seemed to be pork belly, but who doesn't love pork belly / bacon, honestly.   Inside, it's reminiscent of a British subway/interior(?) With white tiled walls and black wooden booths. It's different and fresher from the Edison bulbs and reclaimed wood tables that you find in almost every restaurant on this street (duly noted this evening as iconic hipster restaurant)  It was packed on a Monday night, and after 7pm it started getting busier and louder. I would have liked the lighting to be a bit brighter overall, but it definitely made me forget that I had work the next day.   For dinner we had oysters and complemented it with a hearty Pork Belly Periogies - they were quite big, and 5 on the plate - topped with pork belly (not inside) and carmelized onions.   I had the most unique thing on the menu, the poached duck egg with lobster and corned beef hash and Bearnaise sauce. Athough tasty, I was a little disappointed with the dish over all. I expected the lobster to be mixed in with the hash (that's what it sounded like), instead it was just on the side. The lobster was tough and over cooked, as if it was done ahead of time (also noted was the temperature was room, and not hot). The duck egg, i expected it to be slightly runny with the yolk, but seemed to have hardened (maybe that's the way duck eggs are) and some of the white was undercooked. The salad was unedible. Too salty and sour.  BUT, it did taste good - I would say good effort, but get something else.   My friend got the lamb leg, and at $19 was really good, unfortunately, it doesn't come with any sides (and looks lonely on the plate). Any side is $7-8, but a good sharing portion (we got the brussel sprouts, quite good!).  Hubby got steak fries. Fries were really salty too, but it worked and I ate them all.   The desserts actually sounds really appetizing, but consensus was to try a new restaurant for fun, so I will be back.   Beer and wine range from 8-12 per glass. Due to some mix up at another table, where we ended up with a free beer! Extensive drink menu for beer, wine, whiskey and other liqueurs.  Great for groups, and catching up with friends. They take reservations! I would come back again if in the area, but not before trying a few others on the strip."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped in here for dinner and I really enjoyed the meal. The service however was a bit surly, nothing that was too crazy, but I've rarely had such a disdainful server. I was almost afraid to ask for things, you know, like a drink because of her scorn when we tried to order.  They have great oyster specials if you like them raw. I think from Sunday to Thursday they are $1 each. Our table shared a few items and so I was able to try the Steak Frites, the roasted cauliflower, the Brussels sprouts, and the pork belly. All of it was pretty good and while I enjoyed the meal I'm not sure I would go back. The price of a meal is pretty high considering the service and for me that's kind of a deal breaker."}
{"text":"It feels like this place has been under renovation forever, and I was excited to finally check it out.   The interior is stunning and totally up my alley. Black and white, french bistro inspired. It's beautiful on every note, except the floors. It's weird, it looks like they took so much time on every detail of the wood, walls, and cieling, and didn't quite finish. It also seems a little too swank for the area and not quite on tone for Ossington.  I was there for cocktails and apps before dinner at a nearby location. We ordered the cheese appetizer and while it wasn't quite what I expected, it was amazing. I was expecting more cheese, but it was more of an oil with blue cheese and rosemary to top your bread with. The flavour was surprising, and it was so rich that a small amount was filling.  The service was fantastic. Our waitress was friendly, knowledgable and professional.  The cocktails, however, were forgettable. Except the price, I remember paying a premium for something disappointing. There are better options nearby that take their cocktails more seriously. The Aviation was unrecognizable to me (as one of my favorite drinks), and a few nights later, I had a fantastic version at nearby Cocktail Bar across from Black Hoof."}
{"text":"I had dinner there the other night, we tried a special app of pickled pepperoni, grilled bacon, pierogies and then I had trout for dinner, it was all really good.  The trout apps were a little small so if you are sharing make sure you get a few, the trout was perfect.  Crisp skin, flaky flesh and great flavor.  The also have some interesting beers and I had a great craft cocktail."}
{"text":"Great spot, very cozy and welcoming. The food is great as well. We had the poutine and the cheeseburger and were very impressed. Must say their cheeseburger is the best we have had in the city! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Still a 4 star dinner, but a couple things worth adding since my past few visits...  The fried chicken is no longer served with the super sweet cornbread but collared greens instead and it was still fantastic. The cheeseburger is a very disappointing $18 experience, as is 7 unimpressive chicken wings for a  $15 price tag. But aside from those 2 items everything we've tried has been top form and worth ordering. The other good news is that their draught beer selection is improving with new options arriving regularly."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here on a recent trip Toronto. I'm always looking for menus that take traditional comfort food dishes and spin them in creative ways. The Saint is a relatively new establishment on a strip of Ossington that I'm dying to explore. All the bars and restaurants in this area are very much the style I like - old school with a sleek twist.   The Saint is no different. Think 1950s diner with some serious stylish glam. Booths, glowing ball lamps, large open bar. And the menu! Oh you'll see oysters, foie gras and all the other foodie faves, but also fried chicken, pork and beans, a cheeseburger and daily pot pies. This is all right up my alley.  We started with the oysters - always a good choice. As I've said before, I'm no expert in these, they all taste very similar once you drown them in horseradish, tobasco and chili. My husband had the Sunday Supper - a $40 concoction of salad, prime rib/mashed potatoes/Yorkshire pudding and home made cinnamon pecan pie for dessert. The main meal was a decadent tower of prime rib that was remarkably tender and swimming in a glorious salty bath of savory sauce. It was the best prime rib I've had at a restaurant in a long time. I had the cheeseburger, which was quite good and cooked to order, but certainly played second fiddle to my husband's grand feast.  They gave us free eggnog and rum to celebrate the holiday cheer and we had some classic cocktails to round out our night. I enjoyed the Old Fashioned (although I have had better...).   In all, a great date. Our waiter was good-natured and polite and clearly enthusiastic about the food. It was a fun getaway and a place worth a try for sure. I've dined at variations on The Saint in other cities before, but this is definitely one of the better renditions of \"comfort food gone upscale.\""}
{"text":"A great casual place with great food and spirit selection. Same meat supplier and quality as Jacob & Co. Steakhouse. A bit pricey for the hood though -"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place only has 3.5 stars overall, it's SOOO good. I've been for both brunch and dinner. I would say it's closer 5 stars but there are verryyy few vegetarian items sooo can't really give a full 5 stars in good conscience.   For dinner I had a bunch of the random vegetarian options from their specials menu and they were all really great - especially loved the beet salad and the cheese fondue thing (which is actually just melted stilton with dates on top in a shot glass served cold). Everything was super filling I had to take home my cheese platter...  Came back for Brunch and got the only vegetarian option which was their Nutella french toast. SO SO SO GOOD!! It was insane, so if french toast is your thing definitely check it out.   I've seen on here that people complain about the service but we had the same server somehow for both brunch and dinner and he was amazing! So nice and helpful. Definitely a good spot to go if you're hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"Great food! Roast chicken for 2 is insanely good! I'd recommend the spicy pickles but I don't want them to get too popular and run out. Love Adam G. And the gang. This is a great spot."}
{"text":"I really don't know how to rate this place. I came for brunch on a Sunday at 12:30 with a reservation. Side note: AWESOME that this place takes brunch reservations. More places should start doing that. But back to my review...so I came at 12:30 with my boyfriend and we promptly ordered a caesar, a bellini, an order of donuts, the duck scramble, and the two egg breakfast. Yes, we're fatsos at heart.   The drinks came in a timely manner, as did the donuts. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. AND WAITED. We are by no means slow eaters and we didn't stick around for very long after finishing our food, but we didn't leave this restaurant until close to 3pm! It was quite absurd how long our main dishes took to arrive. Definitely unimpressed with the service.   As for the food itself, I'd call it 'decent'. The donuts were delicious, but the chocolate mousse-like dip it came with was rather tasteless. Actually, I actively didn't like the chocolate dip and I LOVE chocolate. My duck scramble was good but nothing special. I loved the potatoes, but everything else just...normal.   Honestly, the best part about this place, in my opinion, is that it takes brunch reservations. I like the decor inside and it's apparently a very popular drink spot, but I probably won't be back for brunch unless all I want is an order of potatoes and a bellini."}
{"text":"We came in for brunch very hungry and were happy with no wait. However the wait for the food was ridiculous. It was already 1:30 or so and we didn't get food for over 30 minutes. The server was young and not that experienced and never took into account that we were exhausted and the place was not that busy. It was only half full when we got in. The in house sausage was boring and ketchup gross. Never paid high prices for brunch and get below average value before."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and really enjoyed it. It was definitely on the loud side, and with the long bar opposite big curved booths, definitely probably better for singles than our intimate parents-on-date-night dinner. It definitely had a hipster vibe, I think every single guy in there had a beard. Every. Single. One.  But the food was great.  Started with the potted cheese (stilton/figs) which was really really nice, and came with great bread. We had the to-share special, a loin of venison with celeriac puree and greens. The flavours were really nicely balanced - rich, sharp, sweet.   No dessert as we were too full! Which was a bonus as my husband is the kind of person who gets a little sad if the portions are too small."}
{"text":"\"...The Saint @thesainttavern on Ossington is a welcome exception.  It took longer than the owners had hoped to open this vintage inspired tavern but it was well worth their efforts.  A crisp, clean room with incredibly tasteful decor whisks you into a past when simple and to the point also looked good....\" Excerpt from http://morevanilla.com/post/31624036933/get-sainted"}
{"text":"After getting declined by the host at several other establishments on the street, the host at The Saint was refreshingly friendly and helpful.  He couldn't seat us at a table but he did find us a place at the bar.  The staff and crowd was both friendly and welcoming.  The bar staff let us sample beer and rum before making our drink selections.  The drinks were great.   The food was excellent too.  My wife had a burger and frites and I had steak and frites.  If your looking for a casual yet hip place to grab a bite, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"All things considered, this is a good spot!  Sunday through Tues after 4pm they offer buck-a-shuck oysters....and the oysters are excellent. East-coast Malbec (my fave) served with lemon, shaved horseradish and 3 house-made accoutrements (my fave was the straight-up mignonette).  Steak tartare...excellent.  $18 cheeseburger with bone marrow aioli (!!)....very good but not as sublime as the gourmet burger from Harbord Room. However, the Saint fries were crispy and addictive.  Cocktail recommendation: CHERRY BOMB. One of the best cocktails I've had in recent memory. Bourbon, sour cherries, lemon, fresh mint. Amazeballs.  One criticism: We walk in and buddy is on the phone taking a reservation; for 3 minutes or so, he doesn't even bother looking up to acknowledge us. Where are we, Montreal? Be friendly please."}
{"text":"Went to The Saint last night for a drink and a snack. The space looks nice, bright, and fresh, if a little cold for a tavern (at least in the front area, where we sat).   One thing that surprised me was the short menu. All the items lacked any sort of description of the dish. And the prices. SIGH. $16 for a cocktail is the new norm I suppose ... but $18 for a salt cod fritter appetizer? That s**t cray. And naturally, that is what we ordered, at the high praise of the server. It was tasty...did I detect bacon and green olives in that special sauce? No idea. They were very tasty, no doubt, but for what they were, pricey indeed.   Not sure that I'm excited to return...too rich for my blood, especially for basics like pot pies and burgers. I don't mind spending money on good food, but I tend to get more excited about creations that are more unique and memorable.   Seems like a good place for beer with friends, if you are lucky enough to snag a booth!  Oh yeah, it is also LOUD"}
{"text":"The drinks seemed pretty good, with a few unique options. We went there when it not busy at all. The service on the other hand, was quite poor. Our waiter rarely to check on us despite the fact that it was dead.. he seemed more interested in doing errands around the bar.  After waiting so long I finally asked another waitress to get him to come over and then I saw her walk over and chat with him at the till for 10 minutes so I was pretty annoyed"}
{"text":"On Sunday through Tuesday between 4 and 7 (not completely certain, but fairly) they have buck a shuck oysters and bar snacks.  Recently, I came here with friends and sat at the bar during this time for snacks and drinks.  The duck nuggets were a good compliment to the beer. The oysters were fresh from New England and tasted better than any I have had recently. Cocktails were very good and priced at either 10 or 12 dollars.  Service at the bar is good, though the oyster shucking can be slow. The place is not slammed early, so if you are looking for a place to head late Sunday afternoon or after work early in the week, The Saint is a definite competitor."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here with another couple and we loved it. We would say this was one of the best meals and restaurants we ate at all year. We did not find the food overly salty as one reviewer commented but we did find the food very favourable.  Our server was friendly and attentive but not intrusive. The custom cocktails were incredible. Then the food was outstanding! I had the best burger I have had in a long long time along with some great appetizers. My wife loved the chicken. To top everything off the prices were not crazy like in some Toronto restaurants and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful. Plus it is in a cool area of Toronto.   One other thing to people who make multiple reservations on Open Table for different restaurants on the same night. Please be respectful of other people who would like to go to that restaurant but cannot get a reservation because you have selfishly booked a reservation with a slim chance of actually going. You also hurt the staff and the business who lose out on business and tips for which the servers count on to live. Please just book one restaurant on Open Table then go to it. Thanks."}
{"text":"First impressions of this place were very good. They've clearly put a lot of effort into the decor and it shows. The food, on the other hand, was a mixed bag. Their house made country loaf and potatoes are DELICIOUS, and make sure you get jam for your toast. The croque Madame was excellent, but other egg things were just run of the mill. Also, a heap of lettuce does not a salad make!!! We had a weird experience with the bill (we were told a sub would cost $2.50 less than we were charged with no explanation or apology), so this is really more of a 2.5 review. All in all, this is fine if you're in the neighbourhood, but not nowhere near the elite brunch spots which warrant a special pilgrimage."}
{"text":"OVERALL: 3.5 Stars  We had an oyster craving to fulfill so after some searching, decided on The Saint's Buck-A-Shuck (Sunday - Tuesday after 5pm).  The place was easy to find with the shiny white brick exterior.  The Saint was a bit empty when we arrived at 5:45pm on Labour Day but filled up quickly over the next hour.  FOOD - 4 Stars  $1 oysters: pretty good. The two of us had a dozen each (they go down easy!).  Oysters were on the smaller side but for a buck we're not complaining about size. The oysters came with three sauces which were all good: a vinaigrette, homemade cocktail sauce, and mango scotch bonnet.  I was really excited to try the mango scotch bonnet sauce that I read about in prior reviews (it was delish) but I actually ended up liking the homemade cocktail sauce slightly better.    Pierogies: really yummy like others have said.  Filled and garnished with pork belly but still I thought it was a bit pricey at 5 for $13.  Fries with homemade ketchup and BONE MARROW AIOLI.  The bone marrow (LOVE) aioli was to die for, and I don't even like aioli!  Sauteed Broccoli with chili, anchovy, and olive oil: broccoli was really tasty but swimming in oil. We ordered some veg to be \"healthy\" but I highly doubt it was - totally foiled!  SERVICE - 3 Stars  Service was fine - we got everything we needed but was a bit slow considering that it wasn't that busy most of the time were were there.  Docked 1 Star for inadequate treatment of finding a short blond (not mine) hair on the rim of my Caesar.  I saw it as the server put down my drink and pointed it out, and all he did was pluck it off with his finger.  He half heartedly sorta offered to make me a new one but sensing that he wasn't that keen, and that it didn't actually phase me that much, I just kept the drink (and used the straw!)  Even though the hair itself didn't bother me that much, I expected a nicer establishment to care a bit more and insist on making a new drink or comping it.  Oh well.  Overall we enjoyed our food and I'd come back here for the bone marrow aioli and oysters if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Place was very hipster-ish, and somewhat pricey. I ordered a scrambled eggs on bread and a side of potatoes, quite tasty, nothing to complain about here. My girlfriend ordered the salad, and asked for the eggs to be fully cooked, they were not. Overall the service is pretty good, the coffee is awesome. Will not go back however, the menu variety is just mediocre. Pizza libretto next door is a better choice"}
{"text":"Writing this the morning after.  Is this what it feels like to become a pickle?  Pretty much the best deal in town in terms of dollar per gram of sodium.    Outstanding decor.  Excellent snacks.  Wonderful ambiance.  Awesome flavours.  I am being eaten alive by the salt monster.  A delicious carnivorous feast that's perfect for those days when you want to put your internal organs to the test just to see if you can do it without any critical failure or accidental hospitalization.    Like Tough Mudder, but with meat instead of mud.    Is it good?  Sure.   The human body is specifically designed to desire salt, sugar and fat.    I might be dying.  But this was an enjoyable place to spend one's last evening on earth."}
{"text":"Came back here, this time for weekend brunch. This would be a perfect place for a group get together -- they take resos via OpenTable, and the semi-circle booths by the bar are cozy place to dine with friends! It's pretty quiet for brunch, I suppose this is more a place that is known for its bar/dinner menu. The food was excellent and the prices are surprisingly reasonable (most mains $10-15, cheaper than a single cocktail from their bar menu!). I had the scrambled eggs with brie and mushrooms (shiitake! so good!) which came on top of warm, crusty French bread with a side of roasted potatoes and onions. The portion was filling but not so big that you're uncomfortably full! Their juices are freshly squeezed and I really liked their pulp-y pineapple juice. My DC's egg's benny with salmon looked delicious! Service was easy-going and casual. Definitely a great new brunch spot in the Dundas/Ossington area! The thought of waiting in line for popular brunch spots (e.g. Bonjour Brioche, Petit Dejeuner, Aunties & Uncles) really turns me off, so I'm glad to have discovered brunch at The Saint!"}
{"text":"Great place. Came here for brunch, and had the most perfect scrambled eggs & mushrooms with lyonnaise potatoes. Really dig the classy yet cozy ambiance. The booths are perfect for groups. Combine that with delicious food, and decent service and you've got a winner. Also, yummy cider :)"}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for a place to eat before a show at the Lower Ossington Theatre. We wanted Lobretto Pizza, but the girl on the phone there said that at 6:30 we wouldn't have a problem getting a table and that turned out to be a lie, so we popped in a couple doors down to this place.  We glanced at the menu and it seemed alright, so we went for it. The host warned us that we needed to like meat and he was not kidding. Everything on the menu had meat.  The menu consists of a lot of pub faire, but at hugely inflated prices. The atmosphere, unlike what you would expect from a \"tavern\" was not dark and cozy, but white and as my friend described \"sort of like a 1950s bathroom\". It had white tile walls and white floors and a sort of mirrored panel across the walls...so yeah a bit bathroom-like. I guess to make it \"saintly\"?   My friend ordered their sandwich of the day, which was a BLT and fries. I have recently given up beef, which limited my choices considerably, so I got the fried chicken. I should mention that the menu includes exactly ZERO explanation of what any of the dishes are. The fried chicken simply says, \"fried chicken\". It did not explain that this came with mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach (or kale??) with it. Potatoes were good, but had big chunks of bacon in them. That should probably be mentioned, since if anyone doesn't eat pork, I don't think it would occur to them to ask the waiter(ess) if their fried chicken includes bacon.   Food was alright. I liked my friend's sandwich better than my dish and her fries were good.  My meal was exactly as it said. No bells and whistles. I sort of felt like for $20 that chicken should have had some twist to it, or something special, but not really. It was chicken, much like you might receive from KFC, but marginally better (less greasy and salty).   The spinach was VERY salty tasting.   Service was good and everyone there was very nice. Overall it's a fine place, but nothing special and I think they charge too much for average food, with nothing special about it. Whenever I go back to the area, I'm going to try something else. I feel like it's not worth a second try, though it was fine for one try."}
{"text":"The Saint is a carnivorous paradise. Lots of interesting options, all of which contain different meats, ranging from pork to duck and charcuterie too. Really old-school cocktail list with all the classic staples, as well as some with contemporary twists. I'd suggest exploring the appetizers with a few friends and getting a taste of everything. I found the star to be their pirogies, which are stuffed with cabbage and pork belly then covered with sour cream and chives. You're welcome. Other standouts included the duck nuggets, bratwurst, fried pig skin and fried chicken. Interesting meld of southern soul food, eastern european comfort food and contemporary culinary exploration."}
{"text":"'ve eaten here multiple times for brunch and dinner. The menu is good, lots of interesting staples and always a good special. There shared mixed grill and roasted chicken are both phenomenal and worth the money. The duck nuggets are also completely delicious. Great bartenders who know how to make a perfect manhattan and also a decent rotation of beers. I think brunch is better than dinner here, and for some reason it never seems to be too long of a wait. The french toast is amazing, as are the omelet and bennies.  It's quite a large restaurant with a few great seats (the booths are lovely). The only downside is it's ALWAYS cold in here, like really cold. Great place for a date or night out with friends, or to recover the morning after!"}
{"text":"Winterlicious $25  Got the potato soup, cheeseburger and sorbet.  Everything was just really decent. Nothing that stood out. Except the raspberry sorbet which was amazing. Two scoops of deliciousness.   Great staff and love the vibe. Background music was awesome -- way back playbacks all night long."}
{"text":"Honestly the menu descriptions and presentations far exceeded the taste.  Furthermore everything on my plate was room temperature.  I have had much better from the Saint."}
{"text":"We walked in during the hustle and bustle of Sunday brunch. The interior was very upscale and had the feel of an ultra swanky Manhattan tavern. The meals are meat centric with British and French influences. My absolute favourite thing here was the scones and jam. The giant sugar crystal coated scones were served with  a side of heavy whipped cream and velvety blueberry jam. They were truly phenomenal. I also had the breakfast sandwich, which was basically the Egg McMuffin but better by a factor of about 10-100. It was an English muffin with banger patty, American cheese, runny duck egg, and Lyonnaise potatoes on the side. Even the ketchup was made in house. They really impress you with the details here. My comrade had the Steak & Eggs, which was opulent as heck."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night. I ordered the fried chicken (which came with Mac n cheese and coleslaw and a delicious cheese bread) and the thick cut bacon. The chicken was very tasty and I highly recommend it.  Everything was VERY delicious. The service was great. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great venue, lots of style and character.  Food was excellent, burger was a little dry, the fried chicken was flavorful, the salmon skins small and light and the baked rolls were ok.   The service was good (nice to have a change of utensils between courses). The vibe in the restaurant is cool and makes me want to return."}
{"text":"Found The Saint Tavern from a google search for best cheap steak in Toronto. The Saint was listed as having a skirt steak for $19 - sounded great, however it is actually market price on the menu. This means the price may fluctuate depending on what cut they are providing. We paid $24 for steak + matchstick fries, but this too is a very reasonable price for such a delicious steak! I've tried Harbor 60, Barberians, Michaels on Simcoe (never go to michaels), etc and while The Saint doesn't have the same selection of meat, the price is a tiny fraction of what you would pay at a fancy steakhouse.  The decor is plain. GOOD.. Don't know why, but I liked it. Maybe because I want the restaurant I eat at to focus on quality of service/food, rather than the things I consider trivial. And the Saint did just that - they blew their steak out of the park!  Service was sometimes good, sometimes bad. The food took some time to arrive. Our beer came, I asked for a glass to pour it in, and the girl who said she would come back with a glass never came back! I'm not a fan of drinking out of a can.. but I got over it quick. Anyway, I will definitely come back... specifically for the steak with it's creamy butter on top and matchstick fries with garlic aioli. mmmm"}
{"text":"I've come here three or four times. I've been at the bar and in their nice spacious booths. Overall, it's a nice restaurant.  For what the prices are, it's a bit more expensive than I think the food and drinks are worth. I've had their perogies, various drinks etc. nothing to write home about. The staff and ESP the bartender weren't especially nice, kind of abrupt so I wouldn't go out of my way to return.  There are so many bars on the strip that serve cheaper drinks, a bit more dicey, but at least the bartender is friendly."}
{"text":"The  are amazing...  The fried chicken is delicious...  Brunch dinner doesn't matter. You will never be disappointed"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since my last review, and though I'm still pro Saint, I think there's been a minor taint.   The prices here are fairly high, excluding their oyster deals, thus the servers must make decent coin. So, like, why so sour? I'm not one to bitch about service on the regular. I'm talking about *four* visits where I was made to feel like I was an inconvenience for coming in to eat, drink, be merry and spend my hard-earned twoonies. .   Steak, bubbly and Malbecs remain divine. Giant booths still pop my top."}
{"text":"Visited The Saint on a very snowy weekday for Winterlicious. For $25, it was well worth it, especially considering how many people complain about the prices here.    For appies, we had the pierogies and the Reuben Sausage. The pierogies were tasty, but the sausage was amazing - totally captured the Reuben flavour without the carbs and the Russian dressing was on point. TBH,  I was kinda sad I had to split with the boyf because it was so delicious.  For mains, we had the burger and the braised beef - both very good. We got an extra side of bone marrow mayo for the fries, and it was amazing, but I'm total sucker for flavoured mayo. The creamed barley with the beef was perfect for the weather: rich & warm.  For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and the cheese plate. The warm chocolate mousse was nice with cold ice cream, but it wasn't super memorable. Even though I thought the cheese was a little plain, I loved that they had a non-sweet offering for dessert because I'm not a huge dessert fan. And the (onion?) chutney was great with the crispy bread and the salty little cornichons."}
