{"text":"I found the food very tasty!! And they were extremely accommodating given I'm vegan and nothing on the menu is vegan.  The service was really good and it was great to sit on terrace and enjoy the boardwalk !!  It would be more awesome to have more vegan options. Like hummus. Oven roasted potatoes. Bruschetta or Maybe even a lentil soup.  But overall pretty nice experience I would recommend this place and I would return!"}
{"text":"The construction on the main street is finished for now (they paved over the street), so there is usually no problems finding parking close by.  About the resto- it is quite cold in the dining room! Try to sit in the booths that are close to the bar for maximum warmth."}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience. I waited 30 min for my salad to arrive and when it did their was hair in it. Once I finally got the waitresses attention and told her, she apologized and didn't even offer to bring another. Then I waited another 45 min until my main course finally arrived. It was nothing special, then when we asked for the bill we noticed they still charged for the salad!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant. I have been a few times and enjoyed the food very much. They have a lovely terrace and a trendy atmosphere. Overall I would absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"When the best thing you had at dinner was your diet coke, you know there's a problem. 3 friends & I decided to catch up over dinner and since it was such a nice night we decided to dine waterfront. One of the girls I was dining with had recommended Marco's and we figured it was a safe bet. On arrival, things looked promising. We were seated quickly & warm bread with olive oil & vinegar was brought to our table promptly. However, after that, things went downhill fast. It took over 15 minutes for a server to come & ask us for our drinks. Keep in mind, it was not crowded so there was really no excuse for such a long wait. When our waiter finally came to take our order, we ordered a large Caesar salad for the table to share as an appetizer and explicitly said \"to start\" as an indication that we would like to start our meal with a salad, which seems to be customary at every other restaurant. Nearly half an hour went by, and finally our salad arrived... with our pizzas and pastas. One of the hostesses/waitresses/owners/managers (we weren't sure) stopped by our table and asked if we were missing a salad. We said no, it arrived with our meal even though we asked for it to be a starter. She talked to our waiter who assured her we asked him to bring it along with the pizzas... we didn't. Finally the woman passed by the table and I asked for extra salad dressing since the salad was very bare. We were not offered parmesan, nor given salad plates, more bread, water refills, etc. When she brought the dressing on the side, it looked strangely like mayonnaise however we dressed the salad and started to eat our meal. We could not believe how dull the salad was. One of us tasted the dressing from the little bowl and said it tasted like mayonnaise. I didn't believe her until I tasted it for myself. You know when you have leftover mayo on the plate and it turns into a creamy greasy color? Thats what it looked like. Not only did it look like mayonnaise, it tasted like mayonnaise. I don't know what Marco's Grill thinks Caesar salad is, but it is not that. I am not the type of person to complain, but this experience left such a bad taste in my mouth. When the woman walked by again, I quietly said, \"I think that when you asked for dressing, they gave you mayonnaise because there is no flavour in the salad, or when we tasted it alone.\" \"Impossible. We've never had any complaints about our Caesar salad.\" She then proceeded to grab the bowl of dressing and use her index finger to circle the bowl, rub it between her fingers, sniff it. I swear we all thought she was going to stick her finger in her mouth & give it a taste. After that rigamaroll, she said she would \"need to take it in the back\" for whatever reason. She came back with a bowl refilled with what she called \"Caesar dressing\" and asked if this is what we got. When we said yes, she asked if we put it in the salad & mixed (obviously????). She then proceeds to dump the entire contents of the dressing into the salad & mixed it in. Then she said \"maybe you just need some parmesan\". I don't know about you, but when I eat a Caesar salad I have expectations. I expect a delicious lemony, garlicky, dressing and I add parmesan to make it a little creamier. I don't need to add parmesan (not that our waiter even offered it initially) to a mayonnaise dressing. I realize that the base of caesar dressing & mayonnaise dressing may be similar, however I have had many caesar salads in my life. I thought it was impossible to mess one up.. I was wrong. Even after saying we weren't going to eat the salad, she kept tossing it and saying that maybe we just need some cheese. After saying no ma'am we are not going to eat it, she said \"whatever\" and launched the dressing bowl into the salad. After all the back and forth, we assumed since we had not eaten the salad and were wholly unsatisfied, it would be removed from our bill, as is customary, or at the very least offered a dessert. As someone who doesn't complain often, whenever I have been that unsatisfied with a meal, the restaurant is generally accommodating. Instead, it felt like an argument over salad dressing. The salad was smack at the top of our bill. All in all, Marco's had mediocre food, poor service, and left us feeling as though we had completely wasted our money. There are far better places to eat & I would not recommend."}
{"text":"After walking the length of the Ste Anne boardwalk on a recent sunny day, we chose Marco's for lunch based on the nice patio (with about a third of the tables full - busy compared to other restaurants on the boardwalk) and the variety of sauces for mussels.   Off to a bad start right off the bat. It took some time for the waitress to come by with menus - this inattentiveness turned into a theme for our meal. To be fair, there was only one other waitress manning the tables when we first got there. But by halfway through our lunch, there were only two other occupied tables - no excuse for paying so little attention to us then. We weren't being particularly demanding - we just wanted our order to be taken soon after we had closed our menus (I don't think a 10 minute wait is acceptable), and for her to notice when we had finished a beer and offer another one.   Food wasn't bad at all - decent portion sizes - but it would help if the right thing was brought out (twice the wrong item was brought out, both times after having had a discussion with the waitress about the items in question so I'd think she would have remembered). The all dressed pizza had a crust that was doughy and on the thick side, not my preference but it was decently tasty otherwise. The spicy sausage pasta was ok- it was quite a large dish, but something that you could easily make at home. The ravioli with rosé sauce was pretty decent. My mussels with Pernod sauce was good (though there were lots of mussels with the beards still on them) - it was a creamy sauce and the Pernod dissipated nicely into it. Only wish it came with some bread to sop up the sauce!   Overall, the poor service outweighed the food and ambiance - perhaps it would be different on another day, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give it another chance."}
{"text":"I go from time to time to Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, when I want to go out of town, and don't feel like driving much; as it is close to Montréal, around 30min driving distance. I tried several restaurants with a terrace having a view on the canal, I didn't find a good one yet, and Marco is the best till now.  During this last visit I was with my parents and we shared several meals. The calamari was good, nachos okay, their pizzas primavera &  roma average, same for their burgers. Finally service was really slow."}
{"text":"Since the re-opening love the place. The lunch specials are great. Pizza Caesar special is a full pizza and a Caesar salad, you'll be surprised at the amount you get. Soups tastes homemade. Two can dine at night special for $49 includes wine."}
{"text":"Yes, it's Wednesday dinnertime in summer, it's a full patio (roughly 24 tables) with 2 waiters (1 girl, 1 guy) and I have been seated for roughly half an hour now and we have JUST received our drinks. Who knows how long our food will take? I'm unimpressed and getting hangrier by the minute. The side getting served by the girl don't seem nearly as grumpy as the patrons sitting on my side, some who still have menus on their table despite having been seated shortly after us. Excuse me while I go find a manager to talk to."}
{"text":"I had a dinner with dessert here.  For main I ordered one of there hamburgers, which was 'alright' the meat was rather dry. Also the bacon on the burger seemed like it was old and not \"fresh\". The wait time for the food was very long, I don't know if it had anything to do with the amount of people in the restaurant but you expect restaurants to be staffed to handle this amount on Saturday nights right?  For desserts I had the Ferrero Roche layered cake. It was very very good! Nothing worth noting about it."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner with my family on a visit to Montreal.  We ordered the shrimp appetizer with the rose Pernod cream sauce which was divine.  My daughter ordered the escargot with fromage which was also excellent.  The service was good, and the food was very good.  My Dad ordered pasta with a garlic aioli, which he enjoyed but I didn't get to try.  He said the linguini was cooked to perfection.   We also ordered a soup which was pretty good.  It was a light cream of chicken which tasted home made, very tasty.  I would come back here again just to get that shrimp.. amazing."}
{"text":"Lovely outdoor seating area but that's about all that is good about the place. Ordered the set lunch pizza and it's the first time I had a soggy pizza right out of the oven.   Service was also slow. I will not be back here again."}
