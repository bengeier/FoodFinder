{"text":"Food was very good but service is below par. Wasn't crowded at all but still took forever for someone to seat us. Just a person yelling across the room telling us \"Someone will seat us soon\" I recommend it for the food but don't be in a hurry to be seated."}
{"text":"This place is great and very traditional mexican, people in our neighborhood are just limited to mexican food choices. I used to live here and now live in California and trust me most of these menu items are authentic. The new salsa unfortunately has been changed and is not as good but hey at least they are Midwesterners here and add cheese to your meals because I do miss that from authentic mexican."}
{"text":"A local favorite! Prices are reasonable, food is fantastic. Atmosphere is good. Always happy to accommodate special needs and requests. Favorites are fajitas el patron, seafood fajitas, tacos de carne asada...and big wonderful margueritas! Great staff, always a great experience!"}
{"text":"Not the best food. Wait staff does a good job. But, don't bother trying to call in a pick-up order. They take their phone off the hook and leave you waiting. Frustrating!"}
{"text":"Don't discount El Patron because of its location, it is really fantastic Mexican food.  I always order the shrimp quesadilla, which can't be beat.  Even after living in Phoenix and South Texas, I crave the quesadilla from El Patron because it is so different and I haven't found a dish like it anywhere else.  Creamiest, most delicious cheese, fresh perfectly cooked veggies, and shrimp as good as you can find that far from the coast.  Try it, thank me later!"}
{"text":"Delicioso. EP cares about food, and it shows. Consistently the best Mexican dishes we've had in Northeast Ohio. The margaritas are fantastic (and strong).  The seafood burrito and enchiladas, and pork burritos are a few of our go-to items.  My son LOVES the queso and chips (with a bottle of old-fashioned root beer). Totally family friendly, but a great spot for date night, too. One of our top spots."}
{"text":"Attention: cockroach found in food...

Went to El Patron with a group of friends. I found a cockroach in my burrito. I confronted the manger and he blew it off like it was nothing, he was extremely unprofessional about it and made it seem like it was not a big deal. When we walked out they were laughing in our faces and said \"it was only one bug\".. Absolutely disgusted and extremely dissapointed. I do NOT recommend this place. So gross."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Mexican food. Staff has always been very friendly and the food's always been delicious. I just wish they would put alcohol in their margaritas!!!!"}
{"text":"I was there on Friday it was a little busy but not to bad. I really like that they bring you warm chips with salsa almost immediately sometime before they take your drink order. The food is very consistent, it has tasted the same every time I have been there .for the majority of the staff English is there 2nd language, that has only been a problem once and when we stopped another employee he said she was very new and he came back to the table and made sure the order was taken correctly. That was a few years ago and have not had any problems with that since.  I would suggest that you sit in the front if in a small groups (2-4) larger groups are Sat in the side room and seems to be a little louder there. The parking can be a little tight at times when busy. Overall it usually a good experience and I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Best Mexican around. Pleased every time I go.  Great prices, friendly staff, and great atmosphere.  A must visit if you're in town."}
{"text":"Very good margaritas. Food is pretty meh. The salsa has more in common with ketchup than it does anything from Mexico. Maybe I'm spoiled from living in SoCal, but a great Mexican restaurant, this ain't. Chips are cold and hard, food has very little spice. Get the verde sauce at least."}
{"text":"Near flawless every time. The staff is great, food is far higher quality the most Mexican restaurants around Cleveland. They're consistently clean and they pour their drinks very well. It's the kind of place when you frequent, they quickly learn who you are and they start to treat you like family."}
{"text":"We got here about 5:15 on a Friday evening and the restaurant was about one third filled.  When we left an hour later, there were a party of five, and several others waiting.  We were served chips and salsa right after we were seated. For our entrees, my wife ordered the vegetarian enchiladas. There were 3 enchiladas filled with sauteed spinach and zucchini, and came with a side of rice and generous amount of grilled broccoli (which we shared). I had the vegetarian burritos.  There were 2 burritos filled with sauteed red and green pepper, chunks of zucchini, and onion, and came with a side of rice.  Both came topped with a cheese sauce which we asked for on the side.  The meals were $10.99 each, and very good.  We were full, but not overly so.  It was plenty for us, but a bigger eater may want an appetizer or another a la carte item. Our server checked on us several times to see how the meals were, and if we needed anything else. We will be back, and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"El Patron is a mediocre Mexican restaurant.  The service is unreliable and your experience in that area, may substantially vary depending on what waiter/waitress you get. They tend to give large portions, but heavily use fillers like lettuce and broccoli.  The food is not inspired,  however,  it is half-way decent and will do in a pinch. They recently have started tagging on extra charges for items that should be included with the meal. If you can't find decent Mexican this will get you by, but it doesn't compare to even the 'chain' restaurants."}
{"text":"Great Chips and Salsa. The food is above average Mexican Food for the area. The service has always been great and attentive. I would recommend giving them a try if you find yourself in the area I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when my hubs picked this place but I gotta say it...I was pleasantly surprised.  Very cool interior.  We popped in for a quick lunch and let me tell you, the service was Mas rapido!  The chicken fajitas are very, very good.  Highly seasoned.  The only gripe I have is the lunch person was on the smallish side.  Chips and salsa were good.  And the guac, beans, cheese everything else was on point.  We will definitely go back.  This place might officially win my, \"Surprise and Delight\" award!  Lunch for 2 including 1 beer?  $17."}
{"text":"El Patron Mexican Grill is absolutely delicious, with a great staff, and atmosphere. Our family and friends ALL love going to El Patrons! We went there on my wedding day hahaha! I haven't been disappointed with anything new I've tried on their extensive menu... So much goodness listed it's hard to choose from! Just plan on leftovers with their generous portions, perfect to warm up for another whole meal the next day, basically! They make a fantastic salsa with nice warm tortilla chips as you wait for your order. And don't forget to order a luscious tequila margarita! I highly recommend El Patrons Grill if you are looking for some great eats and people!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and the food was pretty decent.  However, today for lunch I was very disappointed.  The refried beans were thin and somewhat soupy.  The burrito I ordered wasn't very authentic.  In fact, it tasted like someone had used Prego Italian sauce for the red sauce that was used.  Also, the meat in the burrito (beef) wasn't seasoned properly and simply tasted like plain old beef.

I'm not sure what changed since my last visit to El Patron, but it wasn't for the better.  The food is lacklustre and isn't very authentic.   I am visiting from Southern California, so I have eaten authentic Mexican food in the past so I could easily tell the difference when I ate at El Patron today."}
{"text":"Nice, hot, and fresh.  I had Enchiladas Supreme (not exact name, but plate of 4 assorted Enchiladas), mom has a chicken burrito and a taco.  Service is good.  You get chips and a mild salsa when you are seated.  The chips are very fresh.  The salsa is more like a sauce.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Pretty high prices for average Mexican food, and the service was slow and a bit rude. Not sure I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Great mexican food, doesn't dissapoint!

Chips and salsa are served right away, chips are nice and hot.  Salsa has a good fresh flavor.

Fajitas are good and smoky, and the extras that come on the side are big enough to be their own meal.  

The quesadilla dinner is also delicious, I am always only able to eat half as the chips and salsa are so good I fill up on those right away.

The margaritas are smooth and delicious, servers always very attentive.  

The guacamole is great, definitely get it with your meal or ask for it on the side.  You won't regret it.  Smooth and cool.  

Nice big restaurant, great for families."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the Chardon area. Waiters are good. Plates are hot. Beers are good. The place has a bar. A lot of families eat there. Prices seem reasonable and the portions are large. You will not go away hungry."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fajitas. Something I usually order.  I got extremely sick from there food. Throwing up and crapping myself every 10 min. I feel bad putting this review up considering I have been comming to this place for years. But they need to bring there standards up and make sure the food is cooked properly.  and also make sure the food is fresh as possible. Old food is never good food. I will try it again in the near future. If I have the same problem I will never come back. EVER"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time! A fun environment, the food is great and the service is good. We always start off with a pitcher of margaritas on the rocks with a salty rim. The margaritas alone keeps us coming back, they are just that good! 
The salsa and chips are on point with the perfect amount of heat. We always eat too many and walk out of there so stuffed. You can't eat just one! 
I ordered the chicken flautas with beans and my husband ordered the Speedy Gonzalez (chicken enchiladas & chicken taco) Both meals were ridiculously good, I don't think we talked the entire time while eating. Which is definitely rare for us haha
The restaurant is clean and big enough if you have a large party. They have a bar in the front and one in the back which is nice when they are busy on the weekends. 

As always we left satisfied and happy. If you are in the small town of Chardon I'd recommend giving this place a try, you won't be sorry....just full and happy!"}
{"text":"Very good food at fair prices. Service is always fast and friendly. We eat here on a regular basis, and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"I go here several times a month.  The Golden Margarita's are the best!  The food is always great.  They have always accommodated us rather it is a table for 2 or a table for 20.  
There is plenty of space and there is rarely a wait for a table."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly and the drinks were cold and yummy. The salsa was average and that is why I am giving 4 and not 5 ."}
{"text":"We went on Cinco de Mayo so we knew they would be busy.  Sat at the bar while we waited for our table.   They were definitely gouging the drink prices.  A Corona and a Dosequis on tap was $16.  The food was typical for other Mexican restaurants we've been to.  I will not go back based on gouging on the drink prices and other people at the bar commented on it.  No reason to do that and it's basic thievery."}
{"text":"I wouldn't rank this among the best Mexican I've ever had, but if you know Chardon, you know that there isn't much around and so the fact that they even have a Mexican restaurant is great! :)  

I had a veggie quesadilla and cleared my plate. The service was super fast for lunch rush and still friendly and responsive.  I'd highly recommend giving this restaurant a visit if you're in town."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled!  Very snowy day and they took our party of 12.  It's much more pleasing to the eye and was pretty busy for the weather.

The waitress was nice enough, plenty of chips and salsa.  Had a little trouble understanding the kids' orders.  However only messed one of them up.

I had the chicken fajitas -- came out sizzling and tasty..broccoli was an odd ingredient but tasty nonetheless.  Everything was piping hot, however they only gave me three small and oddly stale tortillas.  I forked the rest of it after finishing my torts, I didn't need more.

Beer was cold, glasses were clean.  Only major issue was that she screwed up and charged us for kid drinks when they were already included with the meals.  No biggie, she ran out and gave us a gift card to make up for it.

I was jonesing for mex food and by far this was great stuff, far better than I have had in a LONG time.  My sister had the large margarita and at $17 she shared it with her husband but it was still pricey."}
{"text":"Really good local Mexican food. I especially enjoy the fajitas and carnitas. Service is good and the margaritas are really good."}
{"text":"This place like the Middlefield location does not deserves all the attention it gets, the place might be packed on weekends but it is not good really, food here is the standard fair you can have at any \"Mexican\" restaurant, the service is slow and inconsistent with clearly no experience or knowledge of what they're doing, I had one really bad experience some time ago we ordered got our food and when our drink refills arrive they had pieces of paper in it I called the waiter and the manager and the only thing I got was another refill and they even use the same straws unbelievable, no apologies nothing this is poor management and a way of loosing customers fast, they loose me but I am not their core clientele so they will thrive but not with my business."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because overall I am pleased with my visit. The food was good and filling however the service was ok; on a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a 7.5. It took a while for the bartender to greet us.

The food (chicken fajitas) were delicious although I've never had broccoli in fajitas but nevertheless it was good.

A different server concluded our meal and because I didn't really understand her, I agreed to allow her throw away my fajita toppings before I boxed them to go which I was disappointed about. 

Other than that I was satisfied with the meal. The atmosphere was nice and that was a nice margarita. Glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican restaurant in the Chardon area.  Wait staff was very friendly and the food was pretty decent for the money and location - no complaints, no issues.  Total cost for two on this visit: $28.22.  Will re-visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent portion size, fair price, the best salsa, and fabulous service.

Table talk..
Wife: \"I really wanted to take half of this to work tomorrow but it's so good that I can't stop.\" She ordered the Burrito Ranchero.

Me: \"Yeah, I'm upset mine is gone.\" (As I lick cheese sauce off plate) - I ordered the Grande Burrito."}
{"text":"This was a very mediocre Mexican restaurant...the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anywhere I would want to go back to. The waiters were friendly, took our orders fairly quickly and the drinks and food came out fast.  

I got a margarita on the rocks and I thought it was pretty good others at our table also got a Strawberry Margarita and while it was good, I thought it was way overpriced.  I think my drink was $9.50 (for a medium size) and the Strawberry one was $11.25 (also for a medium).  I could see paying that if these were handcrafted drinks, but they were from a slushie machine.

I got the Chimichangas with rice and beans and it just didn't have a lot of flavor to it. I get Chimichangas usually the first time I go to a Mexican restaurant and they usually have peppers, onions, seasoning, etc.  These were just stuffed with plain chicken. The beans were a little more watery than I would have preferred as well. 

This place wasn't horrible, the food was edible, the drinks were good and if you had to go here because there wasn't another option it wouldn't be a horrible experience, but if you want good food, go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Im so disappointed...This has always been my favorite restaurant. I had my first meal in a week since a loss.in rhe family and this is all I wanted...im so disappointed. Food was bland and cold. The portion you get for the dip is ridiculous for $7.50...and it was rock solid,not a dip and mostly grease. Im just so disappointed because ive always loved this place.."}
{"text":"Food is always tasty and the staff does a good job.  Visit at least once a month. Try the steak fajitas!   Yummm"}
{"text":"Went here one Friday evening with my family.  

The service was very slow and lacking.  The chips and salsa were good but the food was served cold and sloppy.  

The only thing that looked to be good were the margarita's the women at the bar were ordering up.  I guess that was the way to go.

I wouldn't go back..."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food. If you base your opinion on the salsa, it's more of a 2. I don't like the puréed mess they serve as salsa. The margarita was good, although the server didn't get our order right. I got the salt and my date didn't. And neither were frozen as requested. 

Our waiter took his jolly time taking our order and then the food came out at totally different times. There were just two of us and we ordered the same thing. The fish tacos were bland but I liked the fresh mango on them. 

The waitstaff were all pleasant, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Yum! Very friendly staff - we where there a little before opening time (yeah, we were hungry and sometimes you get a craving for mexican lol) and they let us sit down and grab a few beverages. We had the wet burritos, delicious and so was the rice and beans and salsa and guac. If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Food: Portions are large and tasty. Not the best classic Mexican food I have ever had, but it is good for the area. Admittedly, I am picky about my Mexican food, having grown up surrounded by 1st and 2nd generations. The chimichangas and fajitas were okay as well.

Margaritas are good...but beware the fruity ones. They are quite sweet and almost scream a wicked hangover, even if undeserving.

Service has been stellar each time I have been there. Quick with drinks, salsa/chip refills and a smile."}
{"text":"Love the food, but the to-go service is horrible. Half the time the phone rings and rings. One time I called and asked to place and order, they said hold on and never came back. Woman bartender not the most pleasant either. I would recommend eating in unless your very patient!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night, and the place was packed. I have to agree with another reviewer who said the food was bland. The spiciness is definitely toned down but the hot sauce on the side helped. Food is okay, not great, but not bad either."}
{"text":"New to the area my fiancée and I went looking for a good Mexican restaurant...  We found it.  The food was very good, the restaurant was clean and looked new/remodeled with a nice bar as well.  This is the place to go if you are looking for a great Mexican Restaurant!  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Good service.  The food is awful.  This was my third time eating here and it will be my last time!  Yuk bad mexican food from a can"}
{"text":"I've given them another chance. The food is still good. You have to try the Tacos Carne Asade. They are excellent! The service has improved. El Patron has definitely increased their turn around time in delivering food. Worth a try."}
{"text":"We originally tried this restaurant because of the El Patron in Middlefield. THIS IS NOT the same place! It's only OK as far as Mexican goes - just take the 20 min drive to middlefield!"}
{"text":"Well... as far as mexican food goes... this place isn't the best. But there isn't really that many places in Ohio that do have good Mexican food. I will say the service is good and I think the prices are decent. The chips and salsa are good! But the salad I had once wasn't too great, and the soup was just okay."}
{"text":"They give you plenty of food for the price. 

The  authenticity is lacking. I have never had a Mexican salad that had sautéed mushrooms and broccoli. They are not ingredients that go with pico d Gallo and cilantro. The shrimp was good."}
{"text":"Best mole poblano in northeast Ohio so far. Fajitas were great too. The large margarita was absurdly large and expensive, but it was a lot of margarita so the value was there. We felt that the large marg was a tad deceiving because it was quite crippling but certainly a lot for your money. 
Well done all around! Just know what you're ordering!"}
{"text":"Got the Pollo Bandidos for lunch... Friggin delicious. Chips and salsa was pretty standard/weak. But the Pollo Bandidos was sooo delicious! Get it."}
{"text":"Very neat place and very friendly staff. 
In terms of food, it tastes pretty bland to me, it could use more mexican spice kick, and more flavor. 
Their complementary salsa is really great though! And overall it's a real nice dining experience. If they could enhance the flavors a bit they'd easily earn the extra star."}
{"text":"We like the food, and the salsa is fresh and good, however, they upsell the margaritas without telling you. We were charged $14 for one margarita when we did not ask for a premium or call brand of tequila. Service was very slow on our last visit as well. My husband doesn't want to return."}
{"text":"This place is in the town i grew up in. I've been going for years with my family. Its got a nice atmosphere and a good bar. I recommend the mini chimichangas and shrimp burritos. the food is very good and I could dine on the chips and salsa alone. If you find yourself in Chardon ohio craving good mexican foods, check out el patron. you wont be disappointed."}
