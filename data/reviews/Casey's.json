{"text":"1-Les ribs ne sont pas bonnes. 
2- la salade cobb est horrible, fromage tex-mex en sachet, pas assez de vinaigrette kraft, des bouts de gras de bacon et du poulet et oeuf égrainés. Sans oublier sur fond de salade défraîchie. Présentation lamentable.
3- Avec le vaste choix compétitif de bons restos dans mtl et les environs, je m'explique mal comment ils restent en affaires. Pour une addition autour de 80$ il est trop facile de trouver vraiment mieux et de ressortir satisfaits. Au moins le serveur était vrmt sympathique."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! We waited 10 minutes to be seated even though it was completely empty. Our waitress seemed to be in a rush to take our order when we first sat down but when we told her we weren't ready yet, she didn't come back for 25 minutes!! If we hadn't received our drinks already, we would have left. We finally ordered and decided to have our appetizers and main dish at the same time because we weren't sure if she would come back. The food was beyond disgusting. My husband's $16 burger was as dry as a hockey puck, my $12 Thai salad was basically bruised iceberg lettuce,mushy mango and a few strands of ramen noodles with dressing drizzled over it. At least my daughter's $12 chicken wings were huge but lacked in flavor and super dry. Our $14 nacho appetizers was basically just chips with cheese and canned olives sprinkled on top served with bottled salsa. Gross. With tip our meal came out to $103 (2 sodas and beer) and all 3 of us left starving. What a waste of money. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"2 Stars  for the only deserved burgers we had, 0 star for the service! The coke we ordered were warm and taste like crap,we complained and the manager said it was working great..Not really honest! and to expensive for what you getting..so if you looking for standard burgers its ok but in general, don't really recommend."}
{"text":"L'équipe du Casey's est super! Chaque fois que j'y vais, le service est excellent. Bonne variété au menu et un bar est également à votre disposition. Peu coûteux et très bon, c'est la place par excellence pour un bon souper entre amis. Un peu bruyant pour les couples qui veulent un souper amoureux. 

The Casey's team is great! Whenever I go there, the service is excellent. Good variety on the menu and it always have some new dishes. A bar is also available. Inexpensive and very good, it is the place of choice for a nice dinner with friends. A bit noisy for couples who want a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a quiet Monday afternoon.  It took a few minutes before someone came to greet us. Not off to a good beggining.
Fortunately our server was quite friendly.
We had the smoked meat sandwich plate with fries and the chicken brochette served with rice and fries. 
The smoked meat was dry, the rye bread was toasted (!!!) and the two slices didn't even match.   Plus the coleslaw tasted off, like it was a few days old and not fresh. It had a bitter aftertaste too. 
The fries seemed homemade but were somewhat cold. 
The chicken brochette was burnt in some places.  Too bad  because the rest did have a great charcoal taste. I wanted to change the rice for salad but charge 2.50$ extra. So it was chicken plus rice and fries.  Not good. 
All in all we were not satisfied with our meal.  We would have had a nicer fresher meal at Mc Donalds for half the price.  We won't go back there that's for sure."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is terrible. My first choice was to eat at Allo Mon Coco, but it was fully booked. I wanted breakfast in a bad way, so I decided on Casey's, what a mistake. Walk into a empty restaurant, takes me 5 minutes to be seated, when I'm finally seated it takes another 10 minutes for someone to serve me. My breakfast consisted of 3 eggs and bacon, my plate comes 15 minutes later!!! What the hell. My miserable breakfast continues with my eggs being runny, and my bacon being one shade away from being burnt. My waiter disappears and only shows up 20 minutes later to ask me if everything is fine. I literary start laughing in his face and ask for the bill, and I explain to him I will never be coming back to this restaurant, good grief, what a bad joke."}
{"text":"I went to check this place out during lunch time with my coworkers and I would say I was a bit disappointed.

The place and vibe are quite good and the servers were friendly. The server cheerful and did greet us all and explained everything.

I ordered the Fusilli Pasta which is a combination of chicken, sun-dried tomatoes and baby spinach tossed in a house rosemary cream sauce with grated Parmesan cheese. The server was good enough to swap the chicken for Shrimp. The disappointment came with the food although the pasta was not the worst but the portion size was too small for the price being charged. You are better off getting a burger with fries here.

There is parking at the place but you will have to give your number plate to be placed into the system as its combined with a hotel."}
{"text":"Ok food... if you want to eat something quick and are on a budget :). We sometimes come here to watch hockey games and have a bite at the same tine. Big terrace during the summer. Their sangrias are good as well."}
{"text":"To be honest this place would have gotten 5 stars but the high prices kept them from it. What else can be said other than the food was fantastic!
Yea I was hungry and yes is in an airport but it was really good stuff. Worth the stop of you are in the airport"}
{"text":"There are less Casey's around now, so I decided to visit one for the first time in years.  I ordered a full rack of ribs.  It was deliciously made covered with their own homestyle sauce.  The meat was very tender, and the portion was large.  The Caesar salad was very small though, and it wasn't that great.  The coleslaw was even worse than the salad.  Very simple coleslaw.  A bit pricey at $27+tax for the ribs meal not including entrees/drinks.

The waitress was funny, and apparently she has been with Casey's for 37 years!  She was an employee at the very first Casey's when it opend up in Sudbury, and worked for the Yorkdale one for 20 some years before it closed.  She probably served the very first french fries in Casey's history!

3 stars.  Would have been 4, but the sides were not great.

C L."}
{"text":"Stay away!!!
Lousy service, under staffed, waited 20 min to get the bill than another 10 to get out. Chicken was burned, beer was expensive. Plenty of choices in the area 
Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, waiter was good, loved he way he menu is set up because it helps to  know what is fattening and not and what is good for the heart and not! Found it to be original because of how the menu is set up"}
{"text":"I live 5 mins from dix30, so for the South shore this area provides many outdoor options for the summer! For a Sunday I didn't have many options available for 4 pm, most rooftops were only open from 5 pm onwards. So I chose Casey's - I've been here numerous times before for their fun cocktails!

On this particular day, it was super hot so I vetted for an outdoor patio seat with the sun baking me in 32C. The menu changed - they didn't have the artichoke dip I usually go for. I ordered a pint of shock top with a Caesar salad. The beer came quickly as did the salad. The presentation of the salad could have been better, looked like I made it at home. Then why would I bother eating out? Not appeasing. Flavour was good. Although, I noticed some old pieces of lettuce - the chefs clearly do not look through their greens. Ugh. 

However, I'm not picky for 25$ it was a good meal experience. I may go for other options next time."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée à l'occasion d'un 5 à 7 au travail! Je n'ai retenu qu'une chose.....le service est très désagréable! 
La serveuse est omniprésente, oppressante et rend l'expérience chez Casey's assez pénible!"}
{"text":"Servicable Budget Hotel Resturant. We had cancelled flight vouchers, and they were redeemable only at this resturant. I had a turkey club sandwich, with nice bread, and rice pilaf on the side. My buddy had the ribs and he said they were good. Service was nice and quick."}
{"text":"Dans la lignée des Moes, Bâton-Rouge et autres chaines, le Cassey n'offre rien d'extraordinaire. Mixte entre une brasserie et un restaurant, les écrans géant prennent beaucoup de place. J'y suis aller pour un diner d'affaire rapide avec un collègue et quoique n'ayant pas particulièrement mal mangé, Cassey reste un second choix pour moi. 
Service correcte et prix correcte pour ce qu'ils offrent, sans plus."}
{"text":"Fruit flies near taps at the bar. The restaurant is in the lobby of a Travelodge, with a typical cast of passing tourists/delayed airline passengers. Food appears not very exciting. I ordered a salad with chicken and dressing, it was just that. Not many options in this gastronomic desert of Toronto, so this may have to do."}
{"text":"This place is awful, never go here. I wouldn't eat here again if my flight was delayed 6 weeks.  The only saving grace was the beef poutine, best poutine to ever come out of a dead horse's ass."}
{"text":"For airport restaurant, this wasn't bad. I had a friendly efficient bartender (I ate at the bar), and a nice draught beer. I ate fish and chips that was served with Cole slaw. It was a large filet of Cod and more fries than I cared to eat. Tarter sauce was ok. I'd eat here again, but the prices are airport steep. It was a strong 3 primarily due to good bartender."}
{"text":"Food was good, my steak sandwich was tasty but a bit too fatty. Caesar salad was perfect but could have been a bit more generous. 

Mom had the sandwich du Marche which had green apples, coleslaw, grilled chicken, beacon, tomatoes I think and get this...  A breaded and fried slice of Cheddar cheese ! Yum but they should make a sandwich out of that alone. 

There's a nice terrace in the back, the waitress I think was alone, it was around 6 on an early weekday. She was friendly but seemed a little too comfortable. 

Now, the not so good....

The prices are steep, the plates we had should not have costed more that 12$ max and they were around 17$ do you know what I can have to eat in Montreal for 17$??? Shaking my head !!!

So despite the fact that i admire their ambition, unless prices drop considerably, I won't be returning to Casey's as there are way more places in Montreal bang for your buck worthy !"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with work colleagues. They had a special: $10 for a smoked meat Poutine. I couldn't resist... but I should have.  The plate must have had 20 fries and 4 slices of fatty smoked meat. It wasn't very good. You get better value and flavour at McDonald's (which isn't saying much). It was lukewarm which made me question its freshness. Needless to say I won't be dining here anytime soon."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting a star (except that you can't rate a place 0 stars), is the exceptionally friendly attitude of the staff - they are a bunch of great people. 

Unfortunately, the food is so bad, no amount of friendliness can compensate for it, so never again."}
{"text":"There used to be a Casey's at Upper Canada Mall in Newmarket.  I regularly enjoyed the Jambalaya, done with noodles instead of rice.  So when I picked up some hungry relatives at Pearson, I had to find them something to compensate for the lousy airline food--quickly. A quick blast down Dixon and we discovered a Casey's in the Travelodge.  

Sadly, my Jambalaya is no longer on the menu.  The menu, however, is new, at least to me.  Some of the old standbys there remained, like the Stacked Sandwich.  Today, I decided to try the Beef Short Rib, a single massive Flintstone's sized rib with lots of tender, flavourful meat, on a mashed potato base with a side of broccoli.  For $26, the dish is at the higher end of the menu, but still really worth it.  We ate at about 4PM, and I did not bother with any other meals for the rest of the day.

A relative had the Shrimp Penne, and I was able to sneak a taste.  The perfectly cooked, sweet shrimp with penne reminded me of the Jambalaya.  For a less than up to date looking restaurant, the food is still better than Kelseys, and with a renovation, would be more of a rival for Moxies at a slightly lower price.  Maybe while they are at it, they could renovate the audio system so it doesn't increase to an annoying volume when there is no-one else in the restaurant at the time. Evidently, the manager could not turn the music down, claiming it is automatically controlled.

Canyon Creek, Casey's and Jack Astors all within a klick means I have a solid trio of options whenever I'm near the airport. I think I will try a full order of the Shrimp Penne next time!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar. The pulled pork sliders are good along with yam fries. The two girls who take turns serving me are very nice. The ghost pine wine is delicious. 
Helena has taken over and she is mosh charming and pleasant without being in your face. She knows how to serve wine. A clean glass which she polishes each additional glass. I will come back here and chill at the bar. Really enjoyed my dinner.  Needed to relax and this did the trick."}
{"text":"It was ok. We wanted a little snack, didn't have breakfast and it was close to where we parked...so yah we tried it. No brunch options but we tried it anyways for the mini sandwiches. 

We each had an iced tea (photo on menu shows bottle but they bring it in a glass with ice). We shared their mini sandwiches: 2 pulled beef sliders, with a side of cesar salad and ordered a french fry on the side. The sandwiches were tiny, but surprisingly filling. The beef was super tender and moist but bland and flavourless despite the thin fried onion rings it was topped with so that was disappointing. The cesar salad was decent, very small portion, but good ingredients and actual bacon not that plastic crunchy nasty pink bacon bit nonsense. Nice presentation of the plate too, but I found it overpriced at 12.50 for the two mini sandwiches and the tiny salad. The fries were ok... Big fluffy and crunchy ...decent fries, not a lot for 4$ worth of fries but we were full by that point so it was ok.

The service, despite other reviews, was actually very quick and decent, our waitress was very attentive and not annoying and I saw at least 3 different staff serving the terrace we were seated at, even though it was quiet for a Sunday afternoon. 

The ambiance was unfortunately really lacking... It's bad enough the terrace is literally adjacent to parking spots but it's far away from the Dix 30 speakers and doesn't seem to have their own outdoor music so if you're on the terrace you're basically just going to sit there staring at cars listening to the other patrons hushed conversations in a weird sorta silence. Wish they woulda had some background music of some kind... Any kind. 

Prolly wouldn't go outta my way to go back here but they had a few other items I would want to try if I happened to be back here for some reason or another."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Casey's restaurant and although it wasn't five star, I certainly enjoyed my meal. 

Appetizer Cesar $4 - well sized to not overdo it, perfect proportions between the leaves, bacon, dressing and Parmesan. 

Appetizer Shrimp Tacos $9 for 2 or $16 for 4. - I took the 4 as my main. They were absolutely delicious and had that \"fresh\" taste to them. My partner in crime didn't approve that they were fried shrimp but they were golden brown and crispy while not dried out. My only qualm is that for playing nicely they were given too much lettuce on the bottom which made them very messy to eat. I still think they were perfect. 

Red Pepper Soup (as a side) - it was tasty but nothing crazy 

Bison burger $16 - with blue cheese (average slice thickness). We both agreed that the patty was great and that the bbq sauce was banging! However, the overall burger was missing a slice of tomato/onion, it was tasty and had great potential but just missed that umphh. 

Beer selection wasn't great, wines were slightly overpriced but they had seemingly good happy hour deals as well as $10 lunch specials. Service was very average, we sat at the bar and although it was an average Tuesday the service left a little (just a little) to be desired. 

Would be more than happy to return."}
{"text":"Le restaurant est dispendieux. Le services est bon mais un peu long. Le plat nachos pour enfant il manque de sauce et fromage. Les pâtes étaient bonnes."}
{"text":"worse place to eat.
All vegs in dishes are not fresh. Not good experiences with waitress either."}
{"text":"Pretty good little place for burgers and other pub type food.  Service has been consistent every time I've been here.  Good spot for a quick bite and a few beers.  They also have a terrase to enjoy the summer weather on.  The bar side is pretty small, so if your going to go here for the hockey game, you better be early, and the last time I checked there was only one poorly positioned TV in the dining room area."}
{"text":"We were in town Thanksgiving (2010) weekend for a quick little visit. We decided to come to Casey's for lunch and a couple drinks - boy am I glad we did!  I ended up getting the \"Du Marche\" and a few Rickard's Whites. The \"Du Marche\" sandwich was AWESOME - definitely something I have not had around here (turkey, panko covered cheese, granny smith apples); and the Rickard's white was basically a Belgian white beer - very good! Being a visitor, I'm always on the lookout for new beer and beer glasses. I asked the waitress, who was a very pleasant girl, if I could buy the Rickard's glass. She asked her manager, who said he would get me a price. When we were ready to leave, he said due to the holidays I could have the glass. All in all, Casey's is a very classy place - another good place to watch a game as they have tons of TVs."}
{"text":"Hey, the staff was okay but the service sucks badly we arrived at the resto around 7:20-30 to take our orders it was long then we got our food around 8:20... Good place but the service sucks bad. I told one of my friends it's probably because they are short of staff at least offer us a free entree wtv it was d*mn long I was starving or hire new personnel  2 star rating"}
{"text":"Mia culpa. I did one star to get noticed. Read on. 
 The food is average to good depending on your choice and usually comes in large portions. This includes salads which are often a roll of the dice at these sorts of places.
My experience recently was tainted by a waitress of unexplainable misery. She brought me a second beer I didn't order and I declined to take it. I just didn't want it is all. She was apparently so offended that the rest of the night was pure comedy. I was with seven others who received fair treatment but she intentionally was rude and terse with me. It was if she had to pay for the beer herself. Is that possible? because it's the only thing explaining her juvenile behaviour. Oh well, sorry Chantelle."}
{"text":"Slow service and super salty food. \"Brisket\" tasted like deli meat soaked in brine. Even the veggies were salty. I was really hungry so I ate most of it but regretted it about half an hour later if you know what I'm saying."}
