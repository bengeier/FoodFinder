{"text":"I haven't been here in years, and I don't know why. We went for lunch, and Kevin was the only one serving, which made me a little nervous. He did an unbelievable job bouncing from section, from inside to patio, and from dining room to bar.  The best part of our experience was the food. The fungi  mushroom pizza was phenomenal, and our appetizer was good too.  The only thing missing was a little ambiance, it felt like a dead restaurant which amazed me with how fresh everything was"}
{"text":"I had a very unpleasant experience at Intermezzo.    The first item I ordered was the Portabello Tower.  It was good; however, nothing about it resembles a tower; more like a short stack.    Next, I ordered the Gouda Burger.  The flavor was decent but the pita bread bun made it hard to keep the sandwich together and about one-quarter into my meal I bit down on a piece of wood.  The waitress initially attributed it to them grounding their own meat; I didn't follow her logic.  I tried to give the burger one more try before I bit down on some gristle and decided I could take no more.   My side of roasted potatoes tasted like they were roasted a week earlier so I had it replaced with a salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  The vinaigrette tasted like olive oil; there was no hint of balsamic vinegar or spices.   The waitress came back and explained that the wood was from the wood grill they cooked the burger on. Ah-ha!  That makes sense but it's still disgusting and the owners may want to consider replacing their grill.  By the way, they did not charge me for the burger.    My sister ordered the veggie lasagna.  It was edible but very bland.    At any rate, I left very dissatisfied, nauseous and determined to never eat at Intermezzo again."}
{"text":"Came here based on Guy from DDD's show last night. Stuffed cabbage had no flavor . Will have to give another dish a try next time just to see."}
{"text":"This is a fun little pizzeria/Serbian food restaurant that is very unassuming on the outside, yet quite charming inside.  The brick and exposed beams create a cozy, slightly rustic atmosphere.  I ordered the grilled veggie sandwich and was very impressed.  The fresh baked bread, goat cheese, and lightly grilled fresh veggies was the perfect combination for a light-ish meal.    Our server was awesome, we had everything we needed at all points during the meal.  The cost was extremely reasonable.  This place is great for a low key dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"I am a regular. I particularly love the pizza, the steak sandwich, and the eggplant musaka. They create marvelous bread in their wood-fired oven! In addition, an amazing meal can be had when ordering the Friday/Saturday night dinner special--all for a reasonable price. I've been blown away by beef short ribs and root veggies (and introduced to roasted radishes). I've had a bone-in pork chop worthy of happy tears. Others are probably glad for the occasional seafood weekend specials. But there's always a great option on the menu if it isn't a weekend night or the special isn't for you. I love that I can order a good beer or a nice glass of wine or a well mixed Manhattan and be pleased by any choice. Though the wine and beer lists aren't extensive, they have been well selected. Martinis are a specialty. Maybe the best thing here, whether in the cozy, exposed brick interior or on the large patio, is the staff. I am always made to feel so welcome here."}
{"text":"This is my new place to take somebody from out of town, dates, or just chow down with friends.  The place is very comfortable and clean. Their beer selection is great (try the Effemer Apple beer).  Appetizers are slightly pricey  but tasty and well worth it. The menu will have you bartering with friends (you get ____, I'll give you some of my ____) and planning on future visits. I had the Karadjordjeva and it was delicious.  I planned on trying their desserts (which sound amazing) but I was too full.    Go here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best pizza, in Charlotte! Hands down Intermezzo, whips the competition. I live in SC, But I frequently attend concerts in Charlotte and a stop at Intermezzo, is always a must!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasty but service was very slow...and served with an attitude. It was a Sunday afternoon lunch. We sat outside and it wasn't busy...which made the poor service all the more confounding."}
{"text":"Super delicious!! Had the vegetarian sandwich and the goat cheese bread with a salad! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"The Serbian Pizza was absolutely, astoundingly delicious. If you come here to dine, please try this dish as this is pleasing to the mouth and the palate.  The Serbian Pizza is more like an enlarged calzone, but better. I never imagined tasting sour cream, ricotta, with some tomato sauce and ham. I finished the whole thing and I'll have to come back and devour this creation again."}
{"text":"Like the neighbourhood joint, but better.   A solid, Italian-ish menu (everyone seems to rave about the lasagne, but I am a huge fan of the portabello stack) and an incredible service staff (seriously, we don't go in often - every few months, at best - and the servers always comment on our last visit and follow up about whatever it was we chatted about on the previous) make it a place that is worth adding to your rounds.   Cosy, friendly, and delicious. What more are you looking for?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I randomly decided to go here since I used to live right down the street.  The inside was a bit small and cramped but the more I hung out there, the more I found it to be cozy instead.  We sat at the bar since the place was busy and we wanted a good beer.  I ordered the Eggplant Mousaka and the bf ordered Sarma (cabbage rolls).  I never finish my meal before my bf but I inhaled every bite of my mousaka!  Not only was the food absolutely amazing and as authentic as it gets, the owner (I assume) was behind the bar and we talked for a good 20 minutes about authentic Serbian cuisine and how all the dishes were made.  He was so enthusiastic and excited to talk about his food and share it with us!  We learned so much!  To top it off, some of the beers on tap were local.  Enough said.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Cool aesthetic inside. The roasted red pepper hummus is a great starter. All of the several pizzas and Serbian dishes I've had were excellent. I'm looking forward to trying the pastas next. It's also IMO the best pizza delivery available in the surrounding area (P-M, Elizabeth, etc.)"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken florentine pizza over the weekend! My only complaint was the atmosphere on the patio being too loud and the metal chairs were rather uncomfortable. Other than that, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food w/ Eastern European flair.  In fact, that's where the owner is from.  The patio is the best part with a great view of the skyline.  Great spot for cool casual dining.  Good drink specials.  I love this place...no complaints!"}
{"text":"Why did it take me so long to enjoy the pleasures of Intermezzo?  1/2 priced Martinis?!?!  Are you kidding me?? And they are delicious!  Our food was authentic and service was top notch.  We were there during a busy time of the night, where service can sometimes suffer.  Not this place!  Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable.  I can't wait to go back time and time again to work my way thru the menu."}
{"text":"Totally rad in my book. I went with a friend who knows the servers andthe owner. The servers being all attractive and playful, were wonderfully attentive. Our pizza \"millenise\" (I think that was the name) was delisious and came out fast. Hell we ate that pizza  fast. The pie had red onions, sausage and mozz that was made in house. the crust is thin enough to be crunchy but thick enough to not be called a cracker. The wine list is good and desserts were too!!!!! Had the crepes with strawberrys and a hazel-choc√¥ drizzle.   This restaurant is my friends favorite in town for atmosphere and food. Its not the most expensive place, and you might not impress a stiff, but this is the kind of place you want to take people you care about and want to enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best pizza worth every single calorie that comes with it - every type of pizza is delicious especially the spinach ricotta as well as their meat pizza my finicky kids who are very picky about their pizza (I know it's weird) love this place.   Also they are consistently good I've gone there over 30 times and every single time it's delicious"}
{"text":"Great food and knowledgeable/friendly staff.  The loss of a star is due to when it got busy, the staff were stretched too thin and service really slowed down.  Not only was my water glass empty but I had eaten all of the ice before it was refilled.  From the looks of it, the same thing happened to a number of tables around us. However, the food was tasty and I love that they have unique beers on tap. Oh, and the dessert crepe was amazing.  I've tried some of Paris' best crepes and this 'Merican crepe crushed all of them.  I'd go back just for dessert."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  A hidden gem packed with character and charm.  Great food and the best martini you'll find in town."}
{"text":"Only have been to this place twice but both times have been wonderful!  I had been told by several friends that I needed to try it!  The atmosphere is upbeat and energetic and so are the staff.  Very friendly and helpful.  Both times we have gotten the same thing, the spinach pizza.  It is delicious!  The leftovers never make it to the next day!  If there are any!!!  Ready to head back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"From the servers to the music to the fun decor to the food and drink, this place is consistently one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Great food and cool space. Have tasted a lot of the menu and it never lets me down. I think it is the best pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great service! Great pizza! I get the Fungi every time. Love the cozy atmosphere inside. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I love that it is family owned and operated too. Support local!"}
{"text":"Visited Intermezzo on the recommendation of a friend. Like some other Italian style Charlotte restaurants, this one isn't run by Italians, but Eastern Europeans - which has resulted in a great pizza menu (haven't branched out yet) and some unique offerings, like a Balkan stuffed pizza. I haven't tried it yet - I keep telling myself \"next time,\" but I haven't been able to get away from the mushroom or spinach pizzas. The kabob was only so-so (my husband got it once) but we were back a week or two ago and they've cut it from the menu.   GREAT drink specials on Saturdays (half off their martini list) and Wednesdays (half off mixed drinks, top shelf liquors) and they have some excellent - and varied - choices for beer on draft. Everybody's friendly and the prices are good.  Occasionally there are too many servers, in my experience - they loiter around next to the bar waiting for work. (I have only been here in the winter, though...summer might be a different thing.) Overall, one of my new favorite places for a night out."}
{"text":"Tasty food. I love the artwork on the walls are for sale too! Such a bohemian, warm atmosphere!  HORRIBLE parking lot size and navigation."}
{"text":"First let's start off with the service. Waitress Julie B. was awesome. She was very warm and very quick on the welcome. She gave us our menus and our drinks were on the table in seconds. She gave us a little time to check out the menu then came to our rescue to tell us the best things to get. Boy was she ever spot on.   My wife and I started off with the Intermezzo Salad with the balsamic vinaigrette. I don't know about you, but I am not a salad eater, but this salad I could eat all day long. The sweet vinaigrette, and the home made mozzarella really set that badboy off. Julie then ran off a list of her favorite items until we told her to stop at the pizza. We ordered half capriccioso and half intermezzo, and from then on it was nothing but lip smacking and finger lickin. I have had pizzas in NY, Chicago, SF and plenty of other places in the US, but this little corner restraunt in Charlotte is the best I have ever tasted. I'm not just saying this, try it for yourself. The crust was perfect;y crispy and not too thin, nor too thick. They make the dough by hand, and all of the ingredients are fresh. You can taste the freshness as if you were in the garden when they pick  the basil and tomatos. After we downed the pizza it was dessert time. We got the crepe with bananas, strawberrys, and hazelnut choclate sauce and that immediately put me in heaven and didn't want to come down.   If you haven't been to this little hole in the wall spot, then please go. You will be back. You will find yourself forgetting about Papa John's."}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic sarma, Karadjordjeva and burek.. will be back without a question!"}
{"text":"I WANT to rate this place a 5.  We love the food and atmosphere.  But the bar staff is SO surly and inattentive that I really only come here rarely anymore.  And it hasn't changed.  If the owner reads this: get new bartenders.  They are seriously holding back a first class restaurant."}
{"text":"First off - this is not the easiest place to gain access to the parking lot.  If you are coming down Central, the restaurant is on the corner of 10th & Central but you can not make a left turn - go figure!  After several u-turns, we finally made it into the parking lot and enter a whole new dining experience.  Can not say enough about the aroma when you enter.  You start salivating before you are seated.  Service was spot-on with our waiter suggesting several items and explained how they were prepared.  The three of us ordered all different dishes then played round robin.  The broyke (?) was phenominal - pastry stuffed with ground beef, onion and seasonings - how can you go wrong!  Stuffed cabbage was great especially with the recommendation from our waiter to put some hot sauce on it.  Crowning piece was the chocolate creme brulee - this was actually a vanilla creme brulee with chocolate pieces and strawberries - was so good and I do love my creme brulee.  This would stand up to any I have tasted.    Don't be put off by the appearance from the outside.  Once you enter, it is foodie heaven!"}
{"text":"Agree- decent food for a decent price. The fun thing about Intermezzo is that it has a cozy, laid back international feel to it.   The inside is small so big groups will have to sit outside."}
{"text":"Had some traditional serbian dishers and the food was really good!  The service was very good and the crepes were delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a go to spot for our family and any visitors we host. Cozy, great ambiance and atmosphere. Very interesting interior - Its an old building with exposed brick and wood - Rustic but decorated very modernly and artistically. They also have a large covered outdoor patio right at the street. Great for people watching.  The service is good. The wait staff have been there a long time and are attentive. The menu is unique. Tons of flavor. Somewhere between gourmet and comfort food. Consistently great creative flavorful food.  The owners are Serbian and so are some of the menu items. There are also gourmet wood fire pizzas and other European dishes.  They have a great beer selection on tap.  esp high gravity craft beers. Love this place."}
{"text":"First let me start off by stating if it says Pizzeria in the name I must eat one period(.)?   Excellent:   Appetizers: Started with corn dip, and garlic twists photos), Both were excellent, corn dip like a crab dip but with sweet corn, just has to be experienced. The garlic twist also very good and an excellent sign on how the pizza crust would come out. You can tell they care about presentation on the twist to take the time to braid it.   Pizza: One of the best pizzas in Charlotte I've ever had, crust was perfect, crispy and doughy just where it need to be. I did have to get the supreme, not my choice, forced by family. All ingredients were high quality, and just as good reheated, cheese didn't turn that melted barbie doll color the next day either.   Ground Beef Burek: House made Fillo Dough, Ground Beef, Onions or Cheese, Spinach served with a side salad with Balsamic Glaze. This was also very good and someone took alot of time to make it, which shows the professional pride of the Chef or Serbian Grandmother in the back making it.  Please remember it is ground beef and there are limitations  Chicken Something?: Not listed on online menu Not sure what called but was sauteed in wine garlic and stuff, sorry not going to elaborate but my nine year old daughter ate more than see usually does of anything.    Service: Trey our waiter was excellent, very attentive and informative and also had a great personality.  Intangibles: Also looks like might not be that bad of a bar to hang out and a beer or 3.  The bad; The distance I live from this place The gravel parking lot for a freshly cleaned car..... sorry a little vain"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent!!  My husband and I have heard about it and decided to try it on the way to a show at Knight's Theatre.  He had the stuffed cabbage and I had the blackened chicken with vegetables.  OMG it was wonderful!!  The homemade pasta is to DIE for!!!  The atmosphere was great, our waiter was the best!!  I can't wait to go back again!!  I highly recommend this place for a nice dinner, pizza etc."}
{"text":"Easy to miss if you're not paying attention (and if there's no one seated outside, which is rare in the warmer months).  Small place; perhaps \"cozy\" is the right word.  Table are comfortably spaced, there's just not many of them.  When they've got the patio open they probably at least double their seating.  I would say the restaurant has character, it's a unique spot.  Service is basically fine, though once or twice they seemed perhaps a little overwhelmed.  They maintained a good attitude, in any case.  The pizzas seem quite good to me, by current Charlotte standards: flavorful with fresh ingredients and a tasty, thin crust (wood fired?).  My frequent dining companion says good things about some soup they have, I think it's chicken and pesto (and I didn't know you could reasonably use pesto as a soup ingredient).  Another well-traveled friend did not have such high recommendation for their kebobs, unfortunately; I think he would describe them as \"run of the mill at best.\"  I will continue to visit this restaurant, on the strength of the pizza alone."}
{"text":"We've been going to Intermezzo for almost as long as they've been open. The food is outstanding - made fresh daily and always delicious! Added bonus, it's a family owned restaurant and they get to know their customers. The owners, Serbian brothers Branko and Djordje, are extremely friendly and welcoming. Trey has been our server from the beginning and has become like extended family to us. It's hard to find gems like Intermezzo!"}
{"text":"I went here years ago and loved it.  After moving back to Charlotte, I went back praying the food was still good.  Intermezzo did not disappoint!  Each dish was excellent and our waitress was totally on her game.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best pizza and Serbian food.  The owner and service are outstanding.  Try the homemade Sharma!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times over the past years and Im always impressed with the service and food. We were celebrating a birthday and started out at a booth but people kept joining us and we had to add chairs. The server was accommodating and friendly, never made us feel we were asking too much. I've tried several things on the menu but now I always order the ground beef burek. It's so delicious!! A Serbian dish with ground beef and onions, wrapped in phyllo dough. It came with cucumbers in a tzatiki sauce and a small salad. Heavenly. If you want an appetizer the bruchetta is always a hit, and I also recommend the crepes for dessert."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and very unique. You need to try this place at least once. The only downsides are that it's a little small on the inside, and while they have a large outdoor seating section, it's at a busy intersection so it can get very loud at times."}
{"text":"I've been here often but things have slipped, foodwise. Our four mushroom pizza had only a handful of limp slivers -- not the juicy assortment we'd had before. And the roasted veggie pizza offered only a handful of chopped onions and other diced greens rather than the smokey slices we'd enjoyed previously. Anyone can have an off night so we'll try again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  All of their ingredients are fresh and tasty, you'll find nothing frozen, microwaved or fried here.  I've never had a bad meal here and their specials are amazing and sell out quickly.  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Intermezzo has most definitely become one of my all time favorite places to eat. I eat here quite often and have never gotten a single bad thing, to eat!  The staff is always very friendly and willing to give you suggestions about different dishes!!  My favorite thing on the menu is the Wood Grilled Fungi pizza. The flavor, the crust, the EVERYTHING is just phenomenal. Appetizers, you can't go wrong with; from the bruschetta, to the garlic braided twists and the goat cheese crostini!   Intermezzo also carries one of my favorite beers, on draft: Blanche de Bruxells!!!   The atmosphere is awesome, inside and out!  All in all, there is not a single thing about Intermezzo that I dislike!!"}
{"text":"I visited this establishment using my groupon.  The service was horrible I have never met such rude people.  I ordered an 20 oz and they brought me a 16oz glass with a 4 glass on the side and told me they are out of glasses and I accepted that.  The icing on the cake was when we ordered dessert it was the worst piece of crap I've ever tasted in my whole entire life.  I informed the waitress she went and told the manger, she returned telling me he is not going to remove from my bill.  I asked to see the manager she told me no, so I went looking for him.  I found him at the bar making drinks this guy basically confronts me saying I altered my order because I didn't want hazelnut cream on my dessert, therefore I cannot get a refund.  His rude a** then proceeds to over talk me not allowing me to get a word in.   Word of advise please do not eat @ this establishment unless you want to be treated like s***.   I guess that is how they do in Serbia"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! From the food to the ambiance. There's not enough good things that I can say about our server Trey!  Overall a great experience!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try this establishment on a rainy friday evening. Parking was iffy but we managed to find a spot. It was nice to see so many patrons. That is always a good sign.  We had to wait just 10 min or so to be seated and my only complaint here is the lack of a comfortable waiting area. Small gripe though. While waiting we were able to watch plenty of food coming out of the kitchen (which looked great) and everyone seemingly having a good time.   We were ultimately led to a small table outside. This is where the service starts to slip. It took far too long for someone to get our drink orders. I think they were just understaffed that night. Moving on...  We couldn't decide what we wanted but finally settled on the goat cheese crostini and a large pizza (I confess I cannot remember which one). The appetizer had great flavor and the bread was clearly made with care. My date liked it so much she ate the crusty edges I discarded.  As for the pizza...fantastic! The crust was nearly perfect with a slightly crispy exterior and a light and chewy interior. The amount of sauce was perfect and it was very fresh tasting and tangy. The cheese and toppings were clearly of above average quality and used appropriately. My date said best pizza she has had in charlotte...but there are others to try. Says a lot that it is her benchmark. I still think Portofinos is its equal if not a different style of pizza altogether.  Will I return? Without a doubt. I want to try some of the Serbian entrees. Yelp did not let me down this time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The first time I tried through groupon.  There are a ton of great options on the menu.  Both times I have been I have split an appetizer and then gotten one of the Serbian meals.  I have asked on recommendations from the waiter both times and have been very pleased.  Note that the indoor seating is limited, but the outdoor is heated."}
{"text":"Their stuffed peppers are worth waiting in traffic for. I was introduced to this cafe by a friend who has frequented Intermezzo for years. I've never had anything at this cafe but the stuffed peppers. I may branch out soon, but for now, the stuffed peppers are worth whatever I need to do to get there."}
{"text":"This review is for the super dissapointing delivery I recently tried.   I ordered a 10\" Grilled Veggie Pizza ($13), garlic braids (2 for $5) and an antipasto salad ($9).  Upon opening the boxes, we were absolutely ripped off.   Veggie pizza: the description claims a wide variety of grilled veggies, and being the most expensive pizza on the menu, I wrongfully assumed there would be a decent amount of toppings. There was almost a handful of nearly minced indistinguishable veggies. While the crust was pretty decent, paying $13 for a 10\" pizza with a sad handful of mushy veggies is insane. The crust is decent and buttery, the sauce is unremarkable.   The antipasto salad didn't have two of the items in it that was listed on the menu. This one also doesn't have lettuce, even though all the others do, but they don't note that on the menu either. I guess that's my fault for assuming.  The garlic braids were overdone and almost tasted microwaved since they were so dry. I was also really dissapointed only two braids were included. Really? Over $2 a piece for that dry wad of dough? Dominos even makes better breadsticks.   The delivery guy also didn't bring silverwear or napkins, and since we were at the Dog Bar (and had a conversation with the person on the phone about it while ordering- so they knew we weren't at home or anything) and after vastly overtipping, the delivery guy blamed the order-taker for not letting him know we'd want silverwear or napkins. I've also never had a delivery guy that doesn't have these extra items in his car, or offer to go pick up the missing salad toppings and silverwear. I expect too much from highschool stoners I guess.    Summary: super overpriced and unimpressive. Pizza Revolution is WAY better for similar prices (I'm fine paying extra if its worth it). The amount of toppings they put on there pizzas alone creams this place.  I won't be trying this restaurant out again, the prices are too high to gamble with what I can only project to be mediocre overpriced food."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  I've been before and remember the pizza being okay.  I ordered something that closely resembled hamburger helper with cheese sauce.  I really didn't care that it looked like that, but I did care that it was frozen in the middle.  The  adult beverage was lackluster as well.  I really wished that someone would have checked back to see if I was enjoying my meal."}
{"text":"Trey, our server had us as soon as he said:   \"We're just a small locally owned restaurant with a Mama and two boys. We don't have a freezer or a deep fryer, we make everything, including our mozzarella in house\".   How could I NOT love this place!  It's got a cozy interior, most everything is made in-house, and our server was super helpful in recommending dishes and telling us about how each is made. Just don't whiz by and miss this place, because it's easy to do, despite it's prominent position smack dab in the intersection of some busy streets.   To the food!  Appetizer, Ricotta/Goat Cheese Crostini: Super fresh tasting ricotta and goat cheeses, melted and toasted on a pizza crust like bread, light and airy and super crisp. Delish!  Margarita Pizza: Just how I like it.  Fresh home made mozz, big slices of tomato, plenty of basil and the crust in a crunchy, chewy, olive oil brushed crust.  Super fresh.   The creme de la creme...the jewel of our meal...the warm-your-insides-on-a-brisk-fall-day...the stuffed cabbage. We were told the cabbage is pickled in a barrel for a month, then stuffed with bacon, ground beef and other ingredients, and cooked for 4 hours until it's delightfully tender and flavorful.  The two stuffed cabbages come in a super savory, salty broth you sop up with either the homemade bread, or...what we did, our pizza crusts.   The strawberry, banana and hazelnut chocolate crepe was recommended to us, and perfectly eggy, lacy and brown on the edges...with a nice cup of tea it was the perfect ending to our meal.   Intermezzo is definitely my latest restaurant obsession!  TIP: Mama loves Tennis and Djokovic so the Tennis Channel was on both the TVs we saw. Our good service, delicious food and stories behind the restaurant made me want to write Djokovic's agent, and ask if he could send Mama an autographed photo."}
{"text":"Pizza is too expensive and doesn't taste like anything special. A tiny piece of tiramisu was close to $7 and doesn't even taste that good. The tiramsu at Carrabba's is cheaper. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner over the weekend. Drove over 40 min. Heard great things about it. The food was very blah!!! We had a issue with the bill so we asked to see the manager. When she came over was very rude. When we said our complaint she looked at us and said you call me to the table for this? And walked away. I honestly think she had been drinking. Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte, period. It's become a staple for date night, and I just got my best friend hooked as well. I haven't had anything that wasn't delicious -- the spinach and cheese burek, pizza, ravioli, salad, goat cheese crostini are all notable. Corn dip is next on the list to try. Service is always on point, too!  Best of all, they deliver. We live 3.5 miles away, so not too far, but that's at least a point of reference. Not sure what their full delivery area radius is.  For a dessert-y nightcap, try the chocolate martini. Scrumptious."}
{"text":"Been eating here since it opened. Consistantly excellent service and food quality. I highly value these Non-chain type Restaurants in Charlotte as things are getting more corporatized. Thank you Intermezzo for giving us a warm friendly alternative good food venue in PMW for all these years!"}
{"text":"Great place with incredible food and service!  Ian was our waiter tonight and he was great, and patient with our kids. The corn dip is wonderful and different - warm, cheesy and creamy, and clearly filled with fresh veggies! My 4 year old are an entire 10 inch pizza!!  My husband and I shared the stuffed cabbage...better than his Polish mother's...and the ground beef Burek. It was all amazing and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and had this amazing \"little\" gem called a Piroska (Balkan Style Stuffed Pizza) that tasted like a Stromboli and a Calzone had a delicious baby. Great service and great atmosphere. Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Last week my girlfriend and I ordered takeout from Intermezzo. My GF has allergies so I checked the order when I picked it up to see if it was correct. In the dim light it was hard to tell so I pointed out to the bartender who got it for me that the order looked incorrect. He was very belligerent, snapped that the order was correct, and walked away.  Unfortunately when we got back home we discovered it wasn't correct... the sides were right but the meals were someone else's dinner. We spent $30+ for a meal my GF couldn't eat. To the owner's credit when I called and pointed out the mistake she replied quickly and corrected the issue.  Overall the food is great and other than the experience with the bartender the staff was very polite."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for my husband and me, when we just want a casual but intimate dinner. Perfect \"comfort spot\"! We usually just get pizza - the crust is just perfect, nicely thin but with a lovely \"crusty\" crust. We love the \"pepe ed olive\" pizza that comes with ground beef. In fact, the ground beef (which first sounded a little odd to me) is so good, we often opt to substitute it for other meats. Ask for Parmesan; it's not just a green tub of dusty cheese, but a bowl of nicely grated actual cheese (how crazy)!   They have a relatively small but respectable selection of beers and wines. Great when you want an easy dinner, not too many choices! It's a nice, cozy setting with brick walls, just the right lighting, and really friendly servers. We often get caught up in conversations with our servers, and although they don't mind stopping to chat, you're never left waiting on them."}
{"text":"Went here this past week and had some decent pizza.  Nothing spectacular, but decent.  I got the 4 cheese pizza and I really did enjoy it but I was actually surprised it had red sauce on it.  I was just expecting a white pizza for some reason.    The beer selection was kind of small, but I can always find something I like so that wasn't a problem.  And overall, the service was very good.  The waitress was attentive but not overbearing.  Finding a decent pizza/Italian place in NC is kind of rare, so I would definitely go back.  The best part was the patio with the great view of the skyline.  However, I do wish the other buildings around there were a bit nicer.  It would be better if it was slightly farther down Central.  Check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try this place while in town, after seeing the DDD episode with that Piroska.  I wasn't sure about the sour cream part of it, but it works so well.  I went here three times in one week.  I got the saut√©ed veggies pasta, stuffed cabbage, and Piroska.  The stuffed cabbage and that bread were so good, and hit the spot with the juicy meat stuffed inside that crisp cabbage.  The tomato sauce juice in the bowl you can just drink, it was that good.  But dip the bread in there, that bread is amazing!  The Piroska everyone was getting, and when I got mine I must have eaten it within five minutes.  It was awesome!  Go here and order anything off the menu, even the pizza looked great!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and it was slammed. Staff seemed to be overwhelmed. Turned out they had just released a Groupon and everyone in town had cashed in on it. Despite a wait, Adam was a super nice server and took care of us.  App: Portabello Mushroom Tower - wouldn't call this a tower, more like a small speedbump but it was good, goat cheese was delicious  Entree: Vege Lasagna - great, really like the sauce  Entree: Wood Grilled Vegetable Sandwich - dining companion had this and she raved about it  Also liked the small, cozy bricked interior - good stuff."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Super friendly staff! Service was a little slow but only due to the fact that this place gets packed!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Food is outstanding and service is excellent.  Stuffed cabbage is to die for.  Lasagna, pizza, chicken dishes are wonderful.  They have an excellent selection of craft beers, as well as a nice wine list.  This was my first  visit, it  certainly won't be the last.  Well behaved dogs are allowed on the patio, which is very nice for those within walking distance."}
{"text":"I always assumed this was just a pizza place, but it is so much more!  Tasty pizzas as well as some interesting Serbian dishes as well.  There is a nice outdoor seating area, though it is plagued a little by the busy intersection outside."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. It's never been too busy and we love there food. We ordered the corn dip as an app and it is amazing!! I had a pizza which was delicious. My wife always get the vegetarian lasagna which she orders EVERYTIME  She tells me it is the best she has ever had. We will continue to come here when in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and I love this place. The atmosphere is my favorite thing about it. It is a place in which I would enjoy becoming a regular.  The outdoor seating on the front patio is very inviting. The drink list is vast, and the pizza is fab. All employees I have encountered have been great! I wish I lived closer so I could hang out there more."}
{"text":"This is more than just another pizza place!!  I am tired of reading reviews calling this spot \"another Italian place\" for this could not be further from the truth. The owners of this interesting space are actually Serbian and the best dishes on the menu are Eastern European rather than Italian.  I assume most people are making this Italian reference due to the large pizza section on the menu. The pizza is pretty tasty and a good crowd pleaser but the real gems on this menu are the more unusual items. My hands down favorite item  is the Ground Beef Burek. This is house made phyllo dough stuffed with ground beef and onions and served with a cucumber sauce (similar to a chunky tzatziki sauce) and a salad. Now I admit this isn't the first thing that I thought about ordering but the server my wife and I had on our first visit almost insisted we try it. And I am very glad he did!! I am addicted to the Burek and eat it almost once a week! The menu also features a Spinach and Cheese Burek which is also very good. The Sarma (cabbage rolls) are also excellent as are the stuffed peppers. If you want something a bit lighter, the sandwiches, which are served on house made bread and toasted on a wood-fired grill, are great.   You will be hard pressed to find a restaurant in Charlotte with more house-made items, particularly at the price point offered at Intermezzo. Intermezzo makes their own bread, their own Mozzarella, and their own Phyllo dough (if there is another rest aunt in Charlotte making their own phyllo I would be surprised). Another reason this spot sticks out is their use of wood fired ovens, grills and stoves. And this place actually uses wood, rather than just saying it on their menu like some other local pizzerias (particularly ones that start with \"B\" and end with \"xx\").   If the food wasn't enough, there is a full bar, a limited but well selected beer and wine list, and some of the best drink specials in town. The only down side is the interior is small and if you are coming with more than 4 people you may have to sit on the patio or in separate booths. However, the awesome food if worth this small annoyance.   If you go to this gem in Charlotte be bold and look past the pizza, and make sure at least one person orders the Burek!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and atmosphere. Their specialty is Serbian food, which we didn't try but sounded good. They had $3 Birdsong beers which was nice. Service could have been better. I would come back!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in Charlotte. It may not be saying much, but it is what it is. We had the grilled veggie pizza and the Milanese (sp). Grilled veggie had ample toppings that were chopped small enough to get a good splattering of everything everywhere without them being too small to taste and the goat cheese wasn't so overbearing that it took over the pizza.The Milanese had a nice mix of cheeses that gave the whole thing a great flavor blend. The hummus wasn't as awesome as the pizza, but we really just came for the pizza anyway and it was just a randomly chosen prelude. I'm definitely a fan overall."}
{"text":"Had the margarita pizza late night and two beers, cost me almost $30 for below mediocore pizza.  The waitress did tell us it does not have sauce on it so we requested sauce instead but they left tomoatoes on there.  A truly sorry and sorry tasting pizza.  Maybe the other pizzas are good but this pizza was awful.  I have heard good things about the other food so if I try some of that i will go back and update but definitely not the pizza."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Intermezzo on each visit.  The Intermezzo Pizza is delicious and they always have great drink specials - harder and harder to find in CLT.  Get to know the owners, they are very accomodating and personable guys.  Especially nice to sit on the covered patio on a lazy afternoon.  Cozy indoor seating as well, TV's included."}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazing service and a solid place for anytime of the week. It has become a regular Friday night visit for the family."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got take out from here tonight. We've been to the restaurant once and I remembered thinking it was good.   Tonight we got the bruschetta which was fine. It wasn't amazing. For our entree he got the blackened chicken pasta, which I tried. It tasted like this chef boyardie thing I used to eat when I was a kid. I got the four cheese pizza. Not the worst pizza I've ever had, however definitely not the best. There was barely any sauce and the cheese tasted plasticy.   Nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"This edition of \"Excited about Eating\" takes us back to the Plaza-Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte, to a restaurant recently featured on Food Network's \"Diners, Drive ins and Dives,\" Intermezzo Pizzeria and Caf√©. This European style restaurant serves hand-tossed pizza and traditional Serbian dishes. It reminded me of some of the cafes we visited on our past trips to Europe.   Dora here. Yeah, especially the cozy interior with brick exposed walls and only a smattering of tables and booths surrounding a hearth-like bar. But they don't need many interior tables with this generous outdoor patio!  After DDD's feature, I was all set to order the cabbage rolls (Sarma), but they were out. So, at the waiter's helpful recommendation, I ordered Karadjordjeva, a ham and cheese schnitzel breaded and pan fried, served with skillet potatoes and tartar sauce, although not the typical American tartar sauce, with a definite hint of dill. Similar to Cordon Bleu, but elevated a few notches, especially with the drizzle of lemon on the top.   Dora here. I ordered the Burek, ground beef and onions baked in Fillo dough. An unusual combination, right? But isn't it beautiful? Nothing spicy or too complex. After a few bites what came to mind was comfort food, much like Mac 'n Cheese is to Americans. Between Ernie and I, we finished off the whole thing. Didn't touch the salad, but that cucumber mixture made for a nice dipping sauce.  I'd definitely order the Karadjordjeva again, but I'd also like to try the Sarma or the Piroska. And the pizza...  Dora here. Guess that means we'll be going back. lol  We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.

{"text":"Came here with our 3rd coupon this year! Yay! This time Google Offers.  Had the Ricotta and Goat Cheese Crostini again as an appetizer, still yummy!  This time I ordered the House-Made Ravioli... AMAZING!  Dense raviolis. Strong sun-dried tomato flavor, very cheesey, rich but fresh marinara. I Highly recommend this dish, you won't be disappointed.  Ordered dessert this time around. The Crepes... I DIE. bananas and strawberries inside, nutella-like drizzle outside (but with white chocolate too?).  ORDER THE CREPES!   Still wish the prices were a little lower."}
{"text":"The menu is very interesting..from pizza to Serbian food, huh. After hearing so many great things about this place, & loving pizza, I had to try it. I went on a Saturday afternoon with my mom. The bartender/server was very friendly. He was as fast as he could be, considering he was the only one on staff. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich w/ grilled veg & my mom got a veg pizza. She let me try some of her pizza, which was quite delectable. I really enjoyed the crunchy crust, no doubt a result of the wood-burning stove. My food on the other hand was not so impressive. I should've gone with my first instinct & ordered pizza, but hey ya live ya learn. The sandwich was average at best, a little on the dry side. The biggest disappointment was the grilled veg. Throwing some zucchini & onion together just doesn't cut it guys."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Service  was a little on the slow side. If you work, don't go for lunch. Nice crispy thin crust, quality ingredients, cool atmosphere...makes for a good meal. Pretty sure I'll be going back."}
{"text":"We went in on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised to see that it was pretty empty. We had looked at the menu online so we had an idea of what we wanted.  Our server seemed to have already had a bad day or something because he was unbearable. He seemed like he would rather be anywhere but there. They were out of the sarma which was a huge bummer because I really wanted to try it. We settled on a large pizza. The server kept trying to finish my sentences as I ordered and it was really irritating.  One thing I was confused about was the different pricing online and on the menu. The menu was priced at almost $2+ more than online. When I mentioned it to the server he said he would check on it...still waiting.  The pizza was good but not for $22. It had chicken, onions and cheese. Pretty overpriced for that thing. I figured I would be paying that amount for something phenomenal but the 99 cent pizza places in NYC beats their pizza. I loved the restaurant itself. The outside seating was great and the brick walls inside added something special to the decorative vibe.  3 stars for the decent pizza but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back there again when I go back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Got here. There is private parking which is nice. It's in a cool part of the city. It's a very small inside part of the restaurant but there's a very large patio. Upon arrival at 7:40pm (on a Sunday) we had to wait for about 15 minutes and then were promptly seated. We got water. I drank my water and then waited for awhile until my server brought more. And then the pizza came out. It was phenomenal. My wife and I got 2 10-inch pizzas for under $30. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Seriously a great place. The interior is really inviting and cozy. We sat 'upstairs' out of the noise and really enjoyed it.   The pomodora diversi is a must order. The veggie lasagna had an intoxicating aroma. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and drink list. There are some really great beers to be had at good prices. I'll be back to to try the most mentioned burek!"}
{"text":"Everything was very tasty. Nice to try something different!  The atmosphere is laid back. Huge patio for outside dining. Bar was quick."}
{"text":"Glad we had a gift card and didn't pay for this meal ourselves . I had a turkey burger, asked for no onions and it was covered in both purple onions and white ones were cooked in the meat, which also made it taste like meatloaf instead of a turkey burger. Not a fan of the bread it comes with personally, but if you like their pizza crust, the bread on this sandwich is the same. We also ordered fettuccini and blackened chicken, which was very bland. It just didn't have much of a taste at all. The last thing we ordered was the pepperoni sausage pizza (can't remember name). It was exactly what you ordered, so if thats the pizza you want, you'll be good to go with that one."}
{"text":"Amazingly great pizza, ambient indoor atmosphere for a cold winter's eve.  This place is probably hopping in the summer on the patio!"}
{"text":"We (four of us -- two adults, two teens) visited Intermezzo this past Monday night.  We had been there once before for dinner and found it just ok.  We hadn't tried the pizza, though, so we decided to give it another try.    Upon entering, we could see that there was no one manning the host desk and little to no \"waiting room\" inside the door.  We could also see that all of the tables were already occupied.  We were greeted by someone who basically informed us that they were \"all full,\" as if to rudely imply that they didn't need any more customers.  \"Unless you want to sit outside\" (it was 40 degrees out) or \"eat at the bar,\" we were then told, spotting four available seats together.  We agreed to eat at the bar and began taking our seats.  We were then asked by the bartender if the teens were underage.  Yes.  Duh.  He then informed us that they couldn't sit at the bar because they were underage.  We then tried to explain that we were just there for dinner and weren't going to drink.  We further explained that we only came to the bar because we were TOLD and OFFERED to sit at the bar by the person by the door.  The bartender just kept insisting that we couldn't sit at the bar.  No one -- bartender, manager on duty, etc. -- offered an apology for the error and miscommunication or even gave us alternatives!  Instead, they all just made us feel unwelcome.  How crazy is that?    So, instead we just left all furious and went to enjoy a fantastic meal and service at Midwood Smokehouse just up the street.  We'll never even attempt to return to Intermezzo with its crazy rude service and inability to function as a welcoming establishment."}
{"text":"What a cozy place with really good food. The service was friendly and extra nice. Sarah was so nice that we can't wait to go back.  We had the grilled eggplant and burek.  Delicious."}
{"text":"I was, unfortunately very disappointed.  Service was not good at all. Waitress stood behind the bar in her phone when not doling out dirty menus and mediocre plates of food. I asked for a Bev nap from the bar and she said I couldn't have one because  they are too expensive but I could have a C fold towel. Can you believe that? Atmosphere is extremely dark and dirty on a bright summer day, yet if you want to sit on the patio you literally have to sit under the heat of the kitchen exhaust fan. It's completely absurd. The food is bland and comes with a blob of aged salad. Tables and seats in the booths are sticky. I can get a burrito with sour cream anywhere (aka Serbian pirotska)  nothing special. Highly do not recommend :("}
{"text":"Pink lady martini (tarty good) & Dark Hollow drought (similar to Guinness & good) The Pizza's here are amazing !!"}
{"text":"The server (I think possibly one of the owners) was so nice and accommodating.   I am a huge fan of the Margherita pizza when made with a tomato base but don't really care for the olive oil base but my friend loves the oil base. This place offered to make the pizza half and half. No restaurant has ever offered to split a pizza with mixed bases. This was amazing customer service.   We also ordered Karadjordjeva. The skillet potatoes were awesome. I just wish there were more in the serving!"}
{"text":"I really like Intermezzo we've come here many times and the service is always good and the food is great!! I've had the pizza, pasta, and some of the traditional dishes they offer like stuffed peppers and the stuffed cabbage both are really good- my favorite is the corn dip to start with and the homemade bread it pretty great!!"}
{"text":"I'd give this a 4.5!  Yummy!!  We ordered through Foodie Call and look forward to visiting this restaurant soon!  We tried the Ground Beef Burek and the Piroska and would definitely order again.  Both were very tasty with generous serving sizes.  Familiar ingredients with great flavor combinations."}
{"text":"This place is truly a gem to Charlotte! I'm so glad I finally got a chance to give them a try.  We started with two appetizers the Ricotta and Goat Cheese Crostini and Bruschetta. They were both excellent. I especially loved the homemade sauce that comes with the crostini. So yummy and great for dipping!   I'd recommend both of them if it's your first time!   For my meal I ordered the Piroska. Geesh, it was amazing! I absolutely agree with Nikki - this is definitely a hidden star on the menu! I mean it's similar to a calzone and packed with flavor. Based on a recommendation from our server I added spinach and it was a perfect combination of awesome. I also got to sample a bit of the eggplant moussaka and it's just as yummy!   I mean there are a ton of great options here! I seriously do not think you can go wrong. There's so much more that I want to try so I'm already looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"if you like carbs this is the best place you can go. practically everything on the menu is bread and cheese based. everything is so good. best way to describe it is just good mediteranean style foods. italian, greek and eastern europe flavors all mixed together"}
{"text":"Solid solid four stars.  I don't think I ordered the right thing so my dish was relatively, but I'd still recommend it because I think there's significant upside.  Cool setting, unique setup.  I'm surprised more people don't talk about this place."}
{"text":"Came back here for our 2nd visit bc the food & martinis were great! Unfortunately on this visit I ordered a martini that I did not like. I tried to send it back, only to have an owner come & confront me for not liking his martini and telling me that I still had to pay for it. Needless to say, I ordered another drink, paid for the one I did not like. I will not be back because of the poor customer service."}
{"text":"I've heard many great things about Intermezzo but I actually wasn't overly impressed when we went. We grabbed a seat on the patio - it was fairly quiet for a Tuesday night.  We started with the portabello mushroom tower. It was somewhat of a disappointment in portion size - for $9, you get a tiny serving with maybe 2 mushrooms. The goat cheese is delicious but I don't think this was worth the money.  We wanted to try true Serbian cuisine. I got the Becka Snicla (Wienerschnitzel) - Breaded Pork Tenderloin, Skillet Potatoes, Creamed Spinach. The spinach was a little too peppery, and the pork tenderloin was rather dry. I think it needed a slice of cheese or some marinara sauce. It was also lukewarm in temperature, as if it had been sitting out for a while. My husband got the Piroska (Balkan Style Stuffed Pizza), which was much better than my dish. It is very similar to a calzone, and stuffed with ricotta and mozzerella cheese and with sour cream on top. Our waitress wasn't overly friendly either.  Overall, I'm pretty disappointed by the experience here, and not sure I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I can give you many reasons to stay away.  From the food to the service to the cleanliness of the establishment.   Really much better places to spend your money."}
{"text":"Piroska (Balkan Style Stuffed Pizza). I am a DDD fan and wow the Piroska is real good. My server said while it is good they really wanted to showcase Karadjordjeva Pan Seared Schnitzel rolled with Ham, Kajmak, Skillet Potatoes, and Tartar Sauce. I just had to try the Piroska. And I am both happy and sad I did the Piroska is real good.  Service atmosphere and over all menu worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Not a place to take someone on a date.  I was not impressed at all! If YOU desire great food and engaging atmosphere - then this isn't the place. This is sad since they were amazing the first year.   Martini's were half off however it was poorly made, so we put it aside and ordered a different martini.  They charged us for the one they screwed up even though we didn't drink it!  I guess we have no complaints about the hummus since it tasted just like the one we normally get at Trader Joes, but the bread they served... cold and chewy.  Our server gave no eye contact and could care less if the cafe served something bad.  We left and went to the Fig Tree... which the food was amazing and the staff was great!"}
{"text":"Serbian's make incredible pizza. Who knew? When we pulled up, I'm not gonna lie... I was expecting to walk in and see one table with a bunch of butch, serbian guys sitting around plotting the rebirth of the empire. Forgive me for the stereotype, I was incredibly wrong. They were just watching soccer.  The restaurant isn't in the hippest of Charlotte areas, but the food was incredible. Up there with some of the best pizza I have ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. The interior was also nicely set up with a cozy, non-motherland feel to it. We had the chicken florentine pizza with roasted red pepper bruschetta. I want to go back, right. now.  It was Superbowl Sunday, but at lunch. The place was pretty busy and they only had one server, but she handled herself very well and took care of everyone. If we do make it back there, I definitely want to try the more traditional Serbian entres. They looked tasty as well."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Went here while visiting family who live in Charlotte! Food was great! They were packed! We all ordered different items and all was delicious. We had a great time! Looking forward to going back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"The chicken franchise red mash potatoes and asparagus was great. Great serves and atmosphere. I would go back. Tray the waiter was great."}
{"text":"This is my homage to my new favorite pizza place in Charlotte.  My husband and I found a Groupon for Intermezzo ($16 for $30 worth of food). We ordered the house Sauvignon blanc while pondering the simple but diverse menu) appetizers, pizza, sandwiches and salads, and Serbian dishes). We settled on garlic knots, the quatro formaggio pizza and the beef burek (one of the Serbian dishes - filo dough, beef, and cheese).   Everything was incredibly delicious - even though they were some of the more generic/plain dishes.  The house wine was semi-sweet and subtle. The garlic knots had fresh garlic and butter on top and came with the best marinara I've ever had while dining out. The pizza was perfectly salty and cheesy, and the Serbian dish came with the best green salad with balsamic dressing and a cucumber & sour cream salad. Normally, I don't over eat, but everything tasted so good that I was quite full when I made myself stop. Portions were quite large, so half the pizza and about half of the burek were brought home.   Ambiance: The building is old and unique with a kind of New England style (brick with wooden rafters and shuttered windows). It was a great setting for a quiet romantic date night - the music selection was pretty awesome as well.   The only complaint I have is that there are televisions at all (but whatever, some people like that kind of thing).   Overall: I was really impressed with the service and quality of food. My husband and I are excited to try other pizzas and Serbian dishes here."}
{"text":"Glad I found another place that can cater to my late night hunger needs! I've been meaning to try Intermezzo. Every time I pass by, the restaurant is packed - at all times (always a good sign). Plus, I love discovering new places to eat and indulge.   As we walked into Intermezzo, a dimly light setting coupled with wooden booths greets us - very elegant for a \"pizzeria.\" Why the quotations, you may ask? When I surveyed the menu, to my surprise I found a list of Serbian Specialties. My eyes lit up and I am pleasantly surprised. Everything sounded delicious, but we locked down on a Smoked Gouda Burger and a traditional Serbian dish - Cheese and Spinach Burek. Both were delicious and I am excited to try the other Serbian dishes next time. Mission Eggplant Musaka is next!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try out Intermezzo for a while now and finally had the opportunity.  I must say that I was not sure what to order since many of their dishes have either beef or pork.  But after checking out some Yelp reviews, I decided to try the veggie lasagna.  This was definitely a good choice! The lasgna was delicious and the portion size was just right - not ginormous. I loved the fresh-tasting tomato sauce and the veggies & noodles were perfectly cooked.   After seeing the reviews that mentioned dessert, I decided to splurge and try the crepes for dessert.  The strawberries & bananas in hazelnut chocolate sauce were so tasty!   On my visit the service was fast & efficient. On.my way out, I walked by a table that had ordered pizza and it really looked good!  I may have to try one of their pizzas on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Took the kids on a circus and a dinner date. Using Groupon. The food was fantastic .The service stellar. The kids had pizza and gobbled it all up like it was the last pizza on earth. I had the Moussaka and I was in heaven. I love moussaka and it can be wrong in so many ways. BUT I was not disappointed it was lovely an creamy bechamel. Just a wonderful dish. My family felt welcome and enjoyed themselves.  I can't wait to explore more of that menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful family owned neighborhood spot. Great wine selection. A bit casual for a date, but sometimes the not so fancy is nice. Pizza crust is a bit thicker than I like, but very tasty turkey burgers."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times, the Burek is very good and the weinerschnitzel as well, but we keep coming back for the pizza. The grilled veggie pizza is crazy good, wood-fired, all the toppings are one size (not sure why, but this is my jam), and it's reasonable that 3 people can share a large. Of course, my wife and I always end up splitting the large between the two of us because we're fat on the inside. Also love that they have beer specials, Friday night was $3 Birdsong taps YES PLEASE."}
{"text":"Really wish we'd had read the recent reviews before ordering tonight  Daaaaaaamn.....this place blows now! Over an hour delivery time for a place that's right down the street. When the lady got here she sat in her car for like 3 minutes so i went out & she continued to rustle around her car for another couple of minutes. When she finally came out she said, \"Oh, you must be hungry!\".....weird. Girlfriend got Cajun chicken pasta with extra broccoli & they gave 2 very small pieces & 1 medium piece & half the pasta portion they used to give. My fungi pizza needed salt & was cold & to top it all off, the desert crepes were burnt. Ha. I called them to try & talk to someone in charge but all I could get was the bartender, who kept oddly calling me buddy lol. He told me that the owner had just delivered my food & she would be back shortly. Wtf? Why was the owner delivering food? Anyway, 30 minutes later I actually get a call back & it's some guy. I start to tell him what happened & he starts immediately getting defensive & arguing with everything I say. Then he tells me I don't seem to be happy with anything. Insinuating that I just like to complain. I tell him about the broccoli & he tells me I'm lying & that i never ordered it online....wow. Not to mention, it seemed like around $15 worth of food for $47!!! Bad food at that. Never going back, sorry guys. Maybe you should read these & learn something."}
{"text":"For some reason the first time we went to Intermezzo I wasn't really impressed.  It was right when they first opened and we sat outside in the heat with lots of traffic passing by.  We didn't even wander inside.  I wish I'd known that dining inside is a completely different experience.  This time around I loved Intermezzo!  The atmosphere was very cool and cozy and had that Plaza Midwood feel.  They have cool local art work on the brick walls and they had kind of a funky music playlist that half the time included rave/techno ish music and the rest of the time was more low key alternative.  I don't know if it was just because I was starving, but I thought their pizza was amazing!  I actually ventured to say it's my new favorite pizza in Charlotte.  We had the supreme style pizza and all the veggies were so fresh and full of flavor.  Yum!  Plus they topped if off with slices of tomato which I'm not usually a big fan of but this time around I thought it was delicious.  Their menu isn't terribly extensive but it doesn't matter to me because I will always be ordering this pizza from now on."}
{"text":"The pizza was absolutely amazing...one of the best we've had in Charlotte. Stuffed peppers are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Ahh Intermezzo your 1/2 price martini's on Sat. Night made me so happy....I must have tried at least six  different kinds and all be back for the cantaloupe.  This restaurant is such a great find the staff is very friendly the place is small but has a great outdoor seating area when the warmer weather arrives you'll find me here.  Let's talk about food as suggested by fellow yelpers i went for the beef burek delicious the homemade phyllo dough was unbelievable.  Make sure to order some apps the corn dip and goat cheese crostini's were a big hit. I can't wait to get back and try some pizza!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the sign reading \"Pizzeria and Cafe\" on the outside of Intermezzo's flavor-filled walls. There's gold in them there walls. Lovely, Serbian and Italian culinary gold. That's right. I said Serbian. You're in for a roller coaster ride of freshness and delight.   The location rests off of 10th street and accessed from Central. Pull into the gravel parking lot and sit in the small dining area or on their glorious patio. Stays cool even in the summertime!   Intermezzo is a small staffed joint that makes everything in house. They don't even have a freezer! They make their own phyllo, mozzarella and salad dressings. It doesn't stop there. Ask your server and they'll be able to tell you ad nauseum on how many fresh items are being churned out of that tiny kitchen. It's ridiculous.   So, feeling a bit nervous about trying Serbian cuisine? Never fear! Order the Burek and thank me later. Phyllo filled with cheese and spinach or ground beef. It comes with a house salad, the balsamic reduction and small side of tzatziki-ish cucumber salad. Each bite of the Burek is tender and savory. Mix up the flavors! I take each bite with a bit of salad and the cucumber mixture. Everything swirls with happiness.   Best vegetarian lasagna I've ever had. The marinara and ricotta work together like old pals. My goodness these guys make lasagna like I've never had. Out of this world fresh flavors and packed full of zucchini, squash, onions, tomatoes and other veg.   Bruschetta. All I can say is GET IT. House made mozzarella and fresh bread, tomatoes, basil. Need I say more?   This place packs a punch with their small bar, too. Tons of local beers and plenty of mixed drinks for you to pair with your meal. Great wine list as well. What Italian joint comes sans wine? Not this place.   If you haven't made it into Intermezzo yet, you're in for a treat. One of the Charlotte gems that you'll frequent on the regular. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years!!  Great mix of eastern european food and the stuffed cabbages are just like my dad makes:)  They are full of flavor and taste just like Romanian Sarmale."}
{"text":"Really great pizza and a lovely atmosphere!  Great place to bring the kids!  The stuffed cabbage is also very tasty!"}
{"text":"Cute spot in Plaza Midwood. The food was alright, nothing to rave about. I had the Roasted red pepper bruschetta and I would say it had too many red peppers on it, but that was my fault for ordering. The staff was friendly and the music was a good mix of throwbacks."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner, and it was a really nice surprise!    The establishment was beautifully decorated/integrated into the original brick building, and the ambience was similar to some of the culinary gems I've stumbled across in Europe.  The music was kind of an eclectic mix of smooth electronic/trip hop, (Think Massive Attack, Zero Seven, Beats Antique, ect...) and a nice compliment to the overall Euro vibe they had going on.    Our waiter was very friendly too, and knowledgeable about the Serbian food selection.  I ended up choosing the stuffed peppers, and they did not disappoint!  The use of yellow bell peppers and a sweet and tangy pepper sauce made the dish light and refreshing. Stuffed peppers can be heavy sometimes if the balance of ground beef, rice, and veggies is off, but Intermezzo's proportions were perfect.  Presentation was beautiful too, and the serving size generous enough to not think twice about spending $15 on an entr√©e.   Will definitely be back again, as they've got a pretty chill bar setup, and raving reviews for their sarma!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, however, was worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I would rate it zero stars if I could. The waitress was so awful I was afraid to ask for a water refill and when I did she gave us warm water with no ice. Half the time you were mid sentence and she would walk away. Also, we waited over 2.5 hours for food that was either under cooked or over cooked. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"We just stopped in here for lunch. It was a slow time in the day so we were told to sit anywhere we liked. The service was attentive and quick. I had the blackened chicken pasta. My husband had the cabbage rolls. Both were amazing. I stole a bit of the fresh made pita that came with the cabbage rolls to sop up the wonderful sauce that covered my pasta. I didn't want to waste a drop. It was everything we expected and more. We will definitely be back. I would like to try the recommended pork chops and work through the pizza menu."}
{"text":"So, I went to Intermezzo with my main squeeze a little over a year ago because we heard friends raving about their pizza and salads. Given the glowing reviews, we went and ordered the pizza and salad and were honestly a bit underwhelmed... the pizza was okay and the salad was humdrum & it's hard to drive past all of the amazing restaurants on Central and pass them up for something that we considered \"just okay.\"   Two weeks ago my opinion of Intermezzo changed for the better... we were invited to a friend's birthday dinner there and went because we love our friend (not because we wanted to eat at Intermezzo again)... our friend recommended that we order off of the Serbian menu and OH MY GOODNESS, the food we ordered was off the hook! My husband ordered a Piroska (a fabulous stuffed pizza dish) and I sampled the Chicken Frickasee... both were amazing.   Thanks to our much more exciting second trip to Intermezzo, there will definitely be subsequent visits -we'll just make sure we order off of the Serbian section of the menu from now on!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, minus 2 for the rude dude.....  Recently got a coupon for this place based on the reviews, and called to see if I could use it for take out, if not I would come back on a day that I had time to eat in.....no problem, take out with the coupon is fine(I was told).  I called the order in and arrived for pick up with coupon in hand and the rudeness begins............if you don't want to honor the coupon, don't participate in the program..........if take out is unacceptable for the coupon, don't tell me it's fine when I call......... I digress, the food was fine, but I will never return, nor will I recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants spots in Charlotte. Warm and cozy ambiance, excellent service, and amazing food! We love the pizza, pasta, and Serbian dishes. Who knew Serbian food was so delicious?! The server, Trey, is probably the friendliest server I've ever had and we eat out about 2-3 times per week. We just can't get enough of this place! I wish I would have discovered it sooner ."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Try the goat cheese and ricotta appetizer. Also love the Intermezzo pizza. All the food here is great and love the patio when the weather is pleasant!  Great selection of beer. Also wine special during the week!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Andrew was great, seated quickly, got a meat lovers pizza, the 10\" was just a bit much- had three pieces left over and if I want traveling I would have taken it with me. Loved the crust."}
{"text":"Went to here yesterday! Order a 22 inch pizza, what came out, look like a 10 inch. The pizza that they post, and what you get, is like night and day."}
{"text":"Excellent service and outstanding food! My husband and I decided to try this place after it was featured on Triple D. We are so glad we did! We started off with the goat cheese and ricotta crostini with a side of marinara sauce and it was wonderful! My husband ordered the sarma and said it was delicious. I ordered the four cheese pizza. I have to say, it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had! The desserts looked scrumptious too. Intermezzo has instantly became a new favorite for us!"}
{"text":"Whenever we want pizza, this is the place we call (for delivery). We've eaten here several times and thought it's worth mentioning. They also have pretty good hummus and other options for those who don't want Italian. I have no complaints and this is where we go for Italian. However, it doesn't blow my socks off. I've eaten at Italian restaurants (when living in Charleston, SC) that are out of this world. This place is good, and that's about it. Nothing outstanding here."}
{"text":"Ask for Will.  Awesome service and great food. Corn dip is the bomb. Pizza is fantastic. Love this place. Quiet afternoon lunch and never had to ask for a thing. Will be back for sure!!! Excellent."}
{"text":"First look at the menu and I was impressed. Interesting and unique dishes. We ordered the stuffed peppers and a grouper special. Presentation was nice however the food was lacking in flavor. It was good but not great. I will go back... The food is good and it's unique so there are definitely more dishes to try.  Oh.. The service was great! Our server was on top of our every need!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and decent service.  Would've enjoyed more refills on water...but overall friendly service.  Really enjoyed the spinach supreme pizza!  Price was reasonable for the quality of food and atmosphere of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed having lunch at Intermezzo.  It's a rather small place, not fancy, but we were really happy with the food.  It seemed very fresh & homemade, not like they opened a can or a jar and served it to us.  We ordered chicken soup (very good and not salty...I HATE salt!), a small funghi pizza (excellent), beef burek (pretty good), which came with a small salad, eggplant moussaka (good, not great), and pork schnitzel (very good).  It was exactly what we were looking for on this occasion, but in all honesty, I wouldn't say I'd go too far out of my way to return."}
{"text":"My stand-by restaurant, and the one I probably frequent most in Charlotte.  Why?  The food is consistently excellent, and the service is great.  Eric, Georgie (one of the the owners) and the other lovely waiter whose name I don't know(!) always go out of their way to make everyone feel at home).  I recommend the Breakfast and Spinach Ricotta Pizzas as well as the Wood-fired Vegetable Sandwich--all are delish.  If they have any Balkan specials, those are worth trying too b/c the dudes who own this place are totally representing their motherland.    As an added plus, they always have great drink specials (e.g., half-off martinis on Saturdays) and appetizers are 50% between 5-7pm (I recommend the corn dip and portabello mushroom tower).  Their outdoor seating area is a big hit in the warmer months, too, and is a good place for groups."}
{"text":"Was a fan of Intermezzo, then last night realized that face was more than a passing familiarity, but my beloved bartender from years ago at Cosmos. Georgio and his brother, wife and family, and a few more friends pour their passion into this groovy grotto. Amazing food, and great wine, for unbeatable prices!  5 stars, because Georgio delivers--yes, to NoDa!   Best small bar with nightly specials to intrigue each night of the week.  xoxo, lemon drop"}
{"text":"Freakin' fantastic put this on your list of places to try. Food is fresh and delicious and they have a good selection of mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here. We usually just get pizza and a salad. Ive heard the Serbian food is really good. The service is up and down. The beer selection is very good and the atmosphere is cool."}
{"text":"We have returned to Intermezzo a few times and the Serbian dishes are very good.  The beef burek is very good.  Think of it is a flaky calzone with perfectly seasoned ground beef.  I have also tried the stuffed cabbage (sarma) which was very good.  Additionally, the sandwiches are very good since they make their own bread.   I highly recommend this place and it is reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. My favorite pizza in the world is here and it's a pizza I would never even order because I hate these toppings but yet somehow at Intermezzo it works. Get the Beef Burek if you've never had it. The smoked Gouda burger. The veggie sandwich. Great owners and fantastic bar crowd."}
{"text":"Thank goodness they deliver! I've only had pizza delivered from here, but it's been the best pizza I've had in a long time. They have just the right balance of toppings, cheese and sauce and the crust is soft and chewy. The Chicken Florentine pizza is my fave. I'm looking forward to eating in the restaurant sometime too."}
{"text":"Been to this place few times and the pizza has never gone wrong!  Haven't really tried most part of the menu, somehow in the mind Intermezzo stands as a pizza place and just that.  Should try other items on the menu, for sure.But again, the pizza has never gone wrong.  Pizza crust, flavor, toppings, quality and quantity - everything is on point.  Service is good, sometimes there is just only one person who does all the work so service might be a little slow.  There is no welcome desk or anything like that, you can enter the place and find any table you like to sit and the server comes to you to take order.  After you enter and looking for someone to show you the table (if its your first time to Intermezzo), they just holler at you to \"sit anywhere you like\".  Wife & I just \"extra\" spoiled ourselves by walking to Two Scoop Creamery for a scoop(x3) of ice cream after relieving our guilt pleasure with a large Veggie & Chicken pizza at Intermezzo."}
{"text":"This place always has great service!  Specializing in Serbian food, Intermezzo is different and delicious. I suggest starting with the hummus, getting a pizza for your main course and drinking a LOT of their yummy tap beers."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte!!! I love the steak sandwich, and the salad. THe balsamic vinaigrette is the best I have ever had.  The martinis are to die for, my favorite is the astropop. My last visit I had the chicken Alfredo pizza, and it was beyond superb.  Home made crust, fresh tomatoes, bacon, so sooooo good.  I love Trey to death he is the best waiter in the Queen City!!"}
{"text":"So I called at 5 pm. on a Monday to see if the flour they use is a pure, unadulterated or not \"enriched.\"  *I've got dietary reasons for avoiding such flour.      I knew it would be a high-gluten flour, and that was all she could tell me, but she sounded so annoyed by my phone call and question. I offered to leave my name and number and said it would be fine if they shot me a quick text message to let me know the answer. I guess I shouldn't be surprised they didn't get back to me?  Their pizza might be awesome, but I'm not going to know if they can't answer a simple question about the flour in their dough."}
{"text":"No thank you. I have been here a few times, back in 2006 and again in 2015 (a few times each). Each time I am reminded why this is off the list. It is officially off the list. Went this past week and the food was blah, service was worse (one of the bartenders playfully hit my friend with a menu as if they were friends - gross and he was gross). Food was bland, beer glasses always warm. Small space and average food and warm-ish beer -- no thanks! Nothing to write home about food wise, so save the time and hit up Pint Central or Pizza Peel."}
{"text":"The entrance is a little confusing. Yes, you have to walk through or around the patio to the get to the front door. The service is good but the hostess can stand to learn some customer service skills. But all that aside, we really enjoy Intermezzo. They have pizza and Serbian food. Yup. That's right... One strange combination but it works!  We've tried the pizza (excellent!) and the Serbian dishes (BEEF BUREK FTW!). I also love places that bring you freshly grated parm. It's entered the rotation as a usual spot!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night and sat on the patio. The patio was a nice little covered area which was great and our server was really nice.  I was with a friend and we shared a margherita pizza. It was ok, overall I thought the pizza was pretty bland. There wasn't much basil on it and the tomatoes had no flavor.  I would like to go back and try something else though as they had a decent sized menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. CONSISTENT! Always consistently delicious food. Service is fantastic. Prices are really fair. By far the best restaurant in CLT. Been here a dozen + times and always leave full and happy!!"}
{"text":"Small but quirky place has lots of character and good pizza.  The interior is tiny but cozy, and the bar area is nice.  We sat outside, and while the patio is fairly spacious, it is quite close to the road and intersection. While we were outside, seven police cruisers stormed by, sirens wailing. Kind of indicative of an area that is still in transition maybe.  The pizza and beer were good, and the service was friendly and prompt.  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Intermezzo is a small, intimate restaurant with a steady cast of bartenders/servers.  You feel like you're walking into a friend's restaurant each time you walk through the door.  There is a small bar that seats 10 or fewer - this is my favorite place to sit - a patio that is heated in the winter and then a dining room with a small nook near the bar.  It's a unique and charming venue.  While many people (including me, sometimes) order the pizza at Intermezzo, their Serbian food is really where the menu shines.   Going in, you should be aware that this is not light food - it's hearty, stick with you, comfort food.   The piroska is outstanding - essentially a Serbian calzone.  The becka snickla - pork tenderloin cutlet with potatoes and creamed spinach - is so very tasty.  I recommend spreading the creamed spinach - which I could eat by the bucketful - on the pork tenderloin.  I also recommend the eggplant musaka - ask for an extra side of the marinara - it's addictive.  I really don't think you can go wrong - and, if you're not sure, just ask your server - they're very knowledgeable and helpful.  The bar offers a few wines by the glass and about about 8 beers on tap that rotate.  If you're going to have more than 4 people, call ahead and see about reserving a table."}
{"text":"I like Intermezzo a lot.  The 1st time I came here a few years ago I ordered the wrong thing and kind of wrote it off, but gave it another shot last summer and am so glad I did!  The pizzas are really good here.  Nice and thin, with a good chewy crust.  I love the corn dip appetizer.  Its whole corn kernels and some cheese and other deliciousness.  The bolognese is extremely yummy.  Nice and hearty with the homemade pasta, perfect comfort food.  I could go on, but you get the point, everything is really good.  I have always had good service here, so no complaints there.  Prices are reasonable, the patio is nice, and its not too far from home.  What's not to love!!"}
{"text":"I'm always hunting for excellent pizza.  This restaurant came up on many Charlotte lists of best pizza.  I'm not sure what style of pizza they're attempting, and it's absolutely fine to create your own style, but this simply wasn't good.  The woman at the host stand told me the pizza is cooked on a conveyor oven.  Again that's not a bad thing, but you need to know what you're doing to make a conveyor oven pizza taste great.  Maybe the Serbian food is better, I'll have to come back and try something else.  My advice is to go elsewhere for pizza."}
{"text":"After driving by time and time again on our way to the Thomas Street area, we attempted to eat at Dish (closed on Sunday?) so we ended up at Intermezzo. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside. At first the beeping from the crosswalk was annoying, then they turned on some music and it sort of drowned it out and it was not really an issue.   Food-wise, it was good. We went with the Piroska (calzone-like thing) and a spinach pizza. The Piroska was pretty good with mushrooms, ham, mozzarella and ricotto cheese. The spinach pizza was okay, we thought it was a little bland overall.   Our server was excellent and friendly.   Overall, nothing that would make me want to return right away, but it was good."}
{"text":"The food was way over priced, the portion size was way to small, the bartender was a dick as he just threw my change at me, I guess at least the food was half decent? Won't see me there again ?"}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob, so I might be over-critical. The place definitely rocks, and it's not that difficult to get to with parking or traffic.   I can recommend the Margherita pizza, Spinach supreme, and Grilled Veggie pizza. It's good pizza, and even if you have insane pizza standards like me, you won't leave feeling disappointed.   The bruschetta is just okay. The garlic braided twists are surprisingly good.   Pretty cool atmosphere, but do yourself a favor and sit outside. It's just a better experience, even if the weather is a bit poor.   Yes, there are televisions outside in case you want to watch sports. Beer selection could be better.   Service is fine."}
{"text":"Wow.. The co-owner of this place is a total jerk. I'm a super regular of this joint being that I live across the street.. If I have an out of towner or wanna go for a chill eve for a drink or two I head over. nEVEr aGAin!! I place an order for take out desert and it was so small I ask for a larger piece. He declined.  If you wanna be ripped off.. Make a visit to intermezzo on central ave."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last night after reading all the great reviews. I must say I was not disappointed. My boyfriend and I started out with a margarita pizza which we loved. They even make the mozzarella cheese in house. For dinner I ordered the Beef Burek and my boyfriend ordered Karadjordjeva. While I loved my food and the flaky philo dough my boyfriend def out ordered me. His food was amazing with ham and cheese wrapped in pork all breaded and topped with a tartar sauce. It was so cheesy and wonderful we will definitely  order it again. Our waiter was also awesome. This is now my new fave in charlotte."}
{"text":"My first visit to Intermezzo was a few months ago because LaurynC wanted to give it a try. Well I am sold! We went back again the following weekend for a girl's night and it was just as good as the week before. On Saturdays they have  1/2 price martinis...you can't beat that! Everyone at the table had something different off the menu and everyone was more than happy with their choices. I will say the goat cheese appetizer and the corn dip appetizer were both amazing...we got them both weekends. Of all the places I have eaten in Charlotte, this place has one of the best atmospheres. It is so warm and welcoming inside and I can't wait to sit out on the patio this spring. Oh and definitely try the mint chocolate chip martini...I had it for dessert and it was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Intermezzo is one of those gems that didn't catch my eye from the road but word of mouth about their delicious food caught my ear!  My short reasoning for giving Intermezzo 5 stars - a) food is amazing, b) price can't be beat.  My only desire for this restaurant is to update the decor inside, and dust the wine racks.  Other than that, I had no complaints.  I went with some friends around 6:30 on a Friday.  We were pleasantly surprised to get a table immediately (only 2 left inside).  The menu made my mouth water.  The selection of appetizers, pizzas and entrees sent me into sensory overload!  Since we were all so undecided, we decided to share.  I was able to sample the Mediterranean Salad, the Grilled Eggplant and the Sauteed Spinach Pizza.  The Grilled Eggplant absolutely surpassed my expectations.  It was perfectly dressed in a basil olive oil, ripe sweet tomatoes, and a dash of balsamic - I could have eaten the whole plate.  Similarly, the pizza swept me off my feet.  I'm from NY, so it's hard to find pizza that can do that!  The dough is fresh, and allows me to fold my pizza (sign of a true NY'er).  All of the ingredients blended together wonderfully.  Last on my food list was the salad.  There was a mix of baby greens, feta, black olives, and we substituted the sun-dried tomato dressing for a balsamic dressing.  It was light and a perfect fit to our meal.  The added bonus to the food menu is the martini menu.  Holy freaking cow.  There must have been 20 different choices.  I opted for the Cantaloupe - a refreshing choice it was!  As most martini prices go, they ranged from $9 to $11.  However, there are much cheaper drink options.  My friends opted for the draft beer specials - $3 Stella's!  We will definitely be dining in again or taking advantage of their delivery very soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout last night from Intermezzo... The stuffed peppers and red roasted pepper bruschetta are just two of my favorites! I now have a top favorite to add to my \"lazy night ordering\". What a great meal to end the long work week!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Friendly staff.  Fantastic food.  1/2 price Martini's.  What else could you ask for?!  The menu said the food is Serbian and since I've never had Serbian food (nor could I point out Serbia on a map), my friend suggested I try a dish.  I ordered the Spinach and Cheese Burek and was extremely pleased.  It's enormous and comes with a delightful side salad made of mixed greens... scrumptious.  Their homemade filo dough was the lightest and fluffiest ever, coupled with warm warm spinach and cheese... this dish definitely brought a smile to my face.  I went on a Saturday night so the martini's were 1/2 priced (originally they range from $8-10).  I had a dirty martini (yummy!), a Pink Lady (very strong and made with tequila), a Pamarita (pomegranate... two thumbs up) and the Espresso Martini (I still have dreams about this one).  I also recommend the Mint Chocolate Chip martini which tastes like ice cream.  Of course when I went we were on a girls night out so it was a perfect place but I also recommend visiting this place for date night or when you're just looking for someplace cool to hang.  It's not too loud, the lighting is a little moody and the staff is very friendly.  This is a must visit in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  I love the bruschetta and the burek.  Pizzas are perfectly cooked, yet different from what we normally think of pizza. The staff there is so friendly, the owners make a point to talk to everyone and they always have a smile on their face. We'll be going back again soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here the other night for the first time and was pretty happy with our experience. Delivery was relatively quick for a Friday night, food was hot when it arrived and all was pretty tasty!  We got a supreme pizza, grilled steak sandwich, and lasagna which we were pretty happy with. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the portions aren't huge, hence the 3 main items for 2 people. We crushed it all thoug and this may become a regular order for us!"}
{"text":"IMHO the cuisine rates 3 stars at best.   I'd award it another star for the excellent service, reasonable prices, the cozily grungy dining room and good vibes ...  but I just can't do it because it's already received too many 5 stars for a restaurant that still has plenty of room for improvement  Those red curtains outside give the wrong impression, walking into the restaurant for the first time was a pleasant surprise. The waiter/bartender was super. He was friendly, always on top of things and struck the right balance between casual and respectful. Also for once I was not driving so I finally got to enjoy a Martini fueled dinner (plain with olives for me).   The Portobello tower was misnamed - it was about 2\" tall. No biggie in itself, that was source of amusement really. The mushroom was a bit tough, the red peppers were great but the goat cheese was that generic (cheap) kind that every restaurant uses and almost tasteless as always. If real goat cheese is not in the budget I'd rather have some feta or even blue cheese but something with a little bite to it. At $9 I can only rate it OK, not bad.  2 1/2*  I confess that I came especially for the Spinach and Cheese Burek. I'm familiar with the Greek, Turkish and my mother's Romanian version but not the Serbian. I should have read David A's review, he did warn about the Phyllo leaves. :-[ Yes I expected crispy and flaky layers of Phyllo with sharp cheese and fresh spinach. It's been my favorite dish since childhood. Instead I was served a large artistically shaped portion of ....dough. It looked a bit like hallah but tasted like a calzone variant. The cheese was not Casieri, Cascaval or anything of the sort, probably ricotta and it was totally bland. There was not enough spinach in it to notice. I didn't expect a calzone.   Very possibly this is exactly what the Serbian version should be like I have no way of knowing it. Simply rating it on how tasty it was, I'd say 2 1/2 stars, but the salad that came with it was very good so together I'd rate the plate 3 stars.   The Moussaka was not the traditional kind either but it was excellent, it was served with a very good tomato sauce -while the Lasagna gets the bechamel, go figure. Wish it had been served with a little something on the side but the menu doesn't offer any. Still I'd rate their  Moussaka 4 stars.    Dessert was crepes stuffed with a big mound of fruits. It kind of looked like crepes but it tasted like, and had the consistency of, American pancake - only thinner.  The pricing is generally moderate but inconsistent. Main dishes are only $11-13 but appetizers like humus ($9.25) corn dip w/tortillas ($9) or the Portobello I mentioned are way overpriced for this venue. Plus they don't offer any side dishes, IMO the menu needs a little tweaking and I'm offering this as constructive criticism.  All together it made for an enjoyable dinner and I'm looking forward to going back and trying other dishes. I'm thinking of the pork schnitzel and the stuffed cabbage  next time."}
{"text":"So I'm drafting this in the restaurant as we sit to eat dinner, so it doesn't get any more real or firsthand thoughts than this. I came here and invited some folks that. First things first. All my elites recommended the bruschetta, so we got both types cause it was half off.  Bruschetta: the first one I had was the one with basil. This one was good, and knowing that they make the mozzarella is something to mention. The basil taste I liked because it balanced the tomatoes. The second type of bruschetta was more tomato based, so that had more of that kind of flavor that I thought was okay.  I ordered the beef Burek and let's say its something new, it's sort of hard to explain but inside the bread it's stuffed with beef and onions. Not much taste, but it's different and I recommend you to get it. I feel like it lacked a sauce or something,  but it was good.  We also had the capriccioso pizza? I'm not sure if that's how you spell it, but it was delicious. I recommend any pizza, it wasn't overloaded with sauce at the same time it wasn't salty.   I also sampled the Wienerschnitzel that they had, which was pretty big. I recommend this dish. It's breaded pork served with a creamy sauce, topped with potatoes. The creamy sauce is a must though because if you don't it'll be a little dry.   Another dish we sampled was the Stuffed Cabbage, which was I say wasn't my favorite. It was sort of vinegary based, stuffed with beef and rice. It was sort of new, but not really that amazing in my opinion.  Inside is small and quaint. They have a full bar, no worries on getting drinks here! It's a casual type of restaurant, so no worries about what you wear. They have dining inside as well as outside, but outside has more seating. Our waiter was a girl named Veronica, who was very polite and nice.  I think I found a new place for pizza. And after looking at the pictures and reading this I hope I found you a new place to discover!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to eat here randomly last night. We ordered two appetizers to share. The goat cheese crostini and the garlic knot bread. Both were tasty but neither I would order again. At least I can say I tried them. My girlfriends got a pizza and the homemade ravioli to share and I tried the ravioli and it was amazing!!! I wish i would have ordered that!  I ordered the stuff peppers and they were ok. I expected a little more since the waiter talked them up so much but to me it was an ok dish. It basically was a pepper stuffed with beef and a small amount of rice with tomato sauce. Also, when I received my dish it was cold in the middle :( hopefully it will be better as leftovers at lunch today."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Intermezzo for awhile and went last night for my first time. We were seated on the enclosed patio which felt isolated and unwelcoming, not to mention noisy from traffic and the blowing heaters. Our waiter is the reason for 1 star. He seemed annoyed when asked for a menu recommendation. Our food was brought by another server and our waiter never came back to check on us. Finally, my friend went in herself to ask for more water and a new fork for our table. The servers inside didn't even help her, so we had to wait even longer for our waiter to finally come back out and he did not even apologize and basically threw the new fork on the table. Terrible experience head to toe, will not come here again. Food was fine but not good enough to come back for that kind of experience."}
{"text":"I was very, very impressed by the service and the pizza was great!! Delicious crust that was soft yet crunchy and the ingredients were definitely fresh."}
{"text":"Ate here on a lovely Sunday evening after seeing the restaurant on DDD. I had the stuffed cabbage rolls and my husband had the Piroska. Everything was awesome! We also had the crepes to share for dessert & they were phenomenal. The place is very small.. I can imagine it getting very crowded on fri or sat night. Nice outdoor seating. Only reason why I gave 4 stars is due to the price.. I felt it was a little overpriced for the size of portions you received. Will definitely return though!"}
{"text":"It's rare that I do this, but even though our food was pretty uneventful, I loved the atmosphere and service at Intermezzo so much that I have to give them 4 stars! The fella and I had Groupon, and we ventured in on a Wednesday night. Although outdoor seating is a possibility, it was too cold the night we went.   I don't know what I expected it to look like on the inside, but it sooo surpassed that - exposed brick walls, nooks and crannies with quaint tables, knick knacks lining a high railing around the bar, cozy, red, hanging lights illuminating the bar... love! We were greeted by the nicest, friendliest man when we walked in, and our waitress (Kate?) was so helpful and fun. I loved everything about it. Seating is fairly limited inside - there were maybe 6 or 7 booths, a few tables, and then 6-8 chairs at the bar.  I decided to get the Becka Snicla (which is pretty much like wienerschnitzel) for $13.25, and the fella settled on the Karadjordjeva for $13.95. He definitely won. Mine wasn't bad; it was just a little bland and dry. He gave me a few bites of his - I had been a little worried about the tartar sauce before we ordered, but it was just drizzled on top, which made there enough for a kick, but not enough to gross me out like tartar sauce usually does. Overall, it was better than mine, but still a little underwhelming.  Maybe we just got the wrong thing and should've stuck to the pizza or the burek? Either way, I'd go back just for the atmosphere and service and chalk up this trip to ordering the wrong things."}
{"text":"I love this spot! I've been here twice now and the bruschetta as an appetizer is a MUST! The first time I went I ordered pizza and I really enjoyed it and my friend had the infamous ravioli and she raved about it for weeks. Recently, I had the blackened chicken pasta and it was amazing-- I haven't had a pasta that cheesy and creamy in a long time-- definitely made my night. I also ordered tiramisu- though I might add that it wasn't really my favorite. It was not as moist as I expected and was a bit flavorless. Other than that, I enjoyed my time at Intermezzo!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food at reasonable prices. Took my father here and it was his favorite restaurant I took him too that weekend. Our favorites were the Portobella Tower appetizer and the Karadjordjeva meal.   Didn't look like much from the outside. But great home cooked, family owned restaurant with great service. Highly reccommend."}
{"text":"Good chill place in Plaza Midwood.  Casual with indoor and outdoor seating.  Good lighting and TV's for game days!  Had Grilled Vegetable Pasta and took our server's recommendation on the Sarma (Cabbage Rolls).  Loved it all.  Many other items on the menu looked really good (including the pizza)!  Look forward to going back to try more!"}
{"text":"Placed order online, never received confirmation. Called, and they couldn't find my order, still have login to their correct url. They put me on hold, put the phone down on desk, after 10 min I gave up."}
{"text":"I was SO excited to come back here after having moved briefly to AZ for 3yrs.  Being 100% Serbian, I was looking forward a good pivo (beer) to find they now longer serve the Serbian beer and they have drastically changed the menu. This my only reason for the 3 stars but it's important to me . They run their Happy hour until 7 , apps were amazing . We will be back but I want my Serbian Beer!!!!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I live in South Florida but every time I come to Charlotte to visit the BF, I love coming here!  The food is beyond fresh and delicious. The service has always been fantastic.  The setting is cozy and rustic but not over the top. Every seat feels intimate and comfortable and the noise level is perfect.  My favorite is the Milanese pizza....omg yum! If you can't decide, they will do a half/half large pizza for you. We did the milanese/intermezzo supreme split...no regrets!!! WOOOH!  We got the red pepper bruschetta this past visit and believe me, I have thought about that alone several times this week during day dreams.  Our waitress was beyond helpful, accommodating and super attentive!  I really love the braided bread too being a carboholic.   I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good pizza... not New York good, but pretty amazing for Charlotte.  Our server was super friendly and helpful. The food came out in under 10 min which was really impressive.  I will say that with the large amount of plastic covers, the place looks a bit cheap... and I didn't have an SUV, I wouldn't feel totally comfortable parking in its lot."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I stumbled upon this place. Reading the great reviews of this place on Yelp, made me have great expectations.  Not to mention the fact that if this place was not as great as it was hyped on Yelp, my friends would have killed me or made me pay for the food. I must say that the place lived upto the Yelp's  reviews.    Ambiance was great, very casual.  Good music... Good service,  the server (who was great, very excited about this job)  suggested 2  pizzas, both of them, were  AWESOME !!  So thanks for the server..  We had chicken florentine (without bacon) and  Garden Fresh. The pizza were great,  made us think why we order Pizzahut pizza.  I found this place to be better than Brixxx.  They do home delivery in 3 mile radius, too bad, I dont live in that radius.   The crowd was also good .. not noisy ...  there was a waiting for a place indoor.  Do not visit this place,  you might cause to this place to get famous and make it crowded ....  just kidding ... do visit.  it is nice place."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and it is worth mentioning this gem of food and drink.  Every visit has been with great service, amazing drink specials and never failing delicious apps and mains.   We've had every app, all worth it.  Last time we had martinis and they were mixed like the best we've had and with a cool atmosphere.  We take family here from out of town when we need a slam dunk of a meal."}
{"text":"Won't be back here ever again. After numerous bad meals, we decided to only go there for drinks -mainly half price martinis on Saturday...we f'd up and came in today (Sunday) craving a martini. We waited TWENTY MINUTES for two drinks. Granted, only one person was working (so we thought) but he didn't even attempt to communicate on the delay until we said something...the worst thing was, a douche started problems with another customer which wouldn't have bothered me(I like a good show) had the TWO MANAGER/OWNERS not magically popped up to argue with the guy! If it was busy enough for our server to be in the weeds, they should've been on the floor helping the staff. just thought that was crap and we decided we wouldn't be back. that is all."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte.  The owners are extremely nice and friendly and the food is excellent! My favorites are the Spinach and cheese borek (although this is the Serbian version of the Greek spanakopita which is what I grew up on), the pizza with Ham & Onion, the bean soup and of course the crepes! Best crepes in CLT! The only thing that they need is more tables and paved and more parking.  Other than that it is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is interesting. The patio is beautiful, with a great view of the skyline. It's a little crowded inside, but the patio is big enough to accommodate a great, big family.  The food is good, the price is very reasonable, and you get the whole excitement of Plaza Midwood without the crowds of the Penguin or other places in the same area. I think Brett M.'s word \"quirky\" is a great word to describe Intermezzo."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I always get the chicken florentine pizza which is out of this world! Everything is always fresh the crust is amazing. They have pretty good drink specials and the waiter is always nice & welcoming. I dine here at least once a week otherwise I would be dreaming about intermezzo's! Me and a friend recently tried something different & it was equally amazing as well"}
{"text":"The ultimate neighborhood bar / restaurant!  Absolutely love this place!  AMBIENCE:   Inside is cozy and warm with exposed brick walls, wood beam ceiling and the sweet smell of the wood fire grill cooking.    Outside patio is specious and cool.    SERVICE:   Friendly. Attentive. Knowledgeable about food and their menu.   FOOD:   Everything tastes good! Great selection.  Eclectic menu. Full of flavor.  There Pizzas are thin crust with FRESH toppings and true italian seasonings.  My favorite is the Grilled Vegetable Sandwich - it's so tasty!  Made with home-made bread, some goat cheese then filed with fresh vegetables grilled in the wood burning grill.  The Serbian food is yummy, too.  Authentic European style!  Satisfies my craving for wienerschnitzle and other delectable treats.  The brushetta is my favorite appetizer - perfectly crusted bread with fresh tomatoes and tons of fresh basil then melted fresh mozzarella on top.  I could keep writing but it's making me so hungry :-)  DRINK:   Good pour for a good price!  Always fun to hang at the bar, good service and good selection of liquors.  They have an awesome happy hour drink special on Thursdays ... only $3 for Stoli flavors.    SUMMARY: We passed this place a thousand times before we finally stopped and gave it a try.  - now we go every week!  It is TRULY worth trying out if you haven't been."}
{"text":"It was absolutely delicious !!!little slow for delivery but definitely worth the wait ! The floors were incredible !"}
{"text":"There Chicken Francese is an explosion of flavor, very delicious. Very great place to spend with a +1."}
{"text":"Cozy place with old brick charm that manages to successfully bridge the 602km, two countries (Slovenia and Croatia), and the Adriatic Sea  to offer both traditional Serbian and Italian fare. Somehow, this formula works!  Came here on a late fall Friday night around 6:00pm and was able to get seated immediately, though things soon changed. By 7:00 there were people waiting in line to sit outside, though the enclosed (and actually acceptably warm) patio had plenty of space. The takeaway: arrive early, this place fills up!  Inside, the tables are spacious, not too crowded, and a good place to relax! Service was stellar and happy to help us take advantage of the $3 draft Stella or Fat Tire beer specials. Well played!  We ordered the much acclaimed Ground Beef Burek and the Wood Grilled Vegetable Sandwich. As fate would have it, right after ordering the table next to us began wafting a buttery-garlic aroma that resulted in 8.0 rumble in my tummy. We had to call back the waitress for an order of the garlic bread sticks. Yum.  Food was all-around delicious. The Burek is simply amazing: fillo dough encasing beef and onions. While the description made me think of flaky fillo dough like on Greek spanikopida, it is actually more on the doughy side (in a very positive way!). Definitely worth it and I would )and plan to) come back for the express purpose of getting this again.  I had a few bites of the Vegetable Sandwich and it was a very well put together mix of veggies and cheese. The garlic bread sticks were good, but I was expecting more based on the smell--probably worth getting once.  I shall return to sample more Serbian food!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about Intermezzo, except that I wish they were closer to my house! Everything we've tried there has been great - I especially love the beef burek and the highly addictive corn dip (Is that even Serbian? Not sure).   Last visit we lucked out and found out they have half priced martinis on Saturday...they were not skimping on the booze in them either. You really can't beat a $5-6 martini on the weekend. They also had half priced apps until 7, this may only be at the bar though.   Definitely a fan of Intermezzo and I need to make a point to go more often!"}
{"text":"Excellent!   We visited early Monday evening, no wait. Service was first rate, intelligent, timely and considerate. The food: outstanding!   We had the house -made ravioli and vegetarian pizza. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a late night snack the other night.  It was a lot smaller inside was my first reaction, but not overly crowded so that's fine.  The patio however looks to be a great spot on a cool night.  The corn dip left a little to be desired and the bruschetta wasn't what I would consider typical in presentation or taste.  Left me with a big ol' plate of MEH.    The pizza (Supreme) came out and they were instantly redeemed!  Great pizza and that alone will have me coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing!! My husband and I are HUGE pizza lovers and have found what we consider the best at Intermezzo. Plus they deliver to our home. Highly recommend a 16\" with 1/2 Milanese and 1/2 Spinach Supreme. The leftovers are perfect for pizza eggs the next morning. When we dine at the restaurant, the staff is always so welcoming and nice. Can't beat delicious food and great service!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum. Everything we had was excellent!    Stuffed cabbage was soo good.   We had a stuffed thing with mushrooms,ham, goat cheese, that was yummy.   Also some stuffed thing with goat cheese and spinach.  Yum.   To end our meal we had tiramisu. One if my favorite desserts.  It was one of the best I've had.  Atmosphere was fun and and service was good. Although slightly pricey We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I really like Intermezzo. Lasagne is very fine. Menu doesn't really resemble the menu posted on yelp."}
{"text":"Intermezzo is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  Their pizza is terrific, and there housemade ravioli is AMAZING.  The steak sandwich with goat cheese is also a great choice."}
{"text":"A must to check out!!!  Fresh ingredients and a punch of flavor!  We have been here a few times now. The first time we came here as a group if four. We ordered the Bruschetta app that was very tasty and had fresh tomatoes and delicious mozzarella cheese (we ate it before I could snap a picture). We have tried the eggplant musaka - it is surprising in how great the flavors are in this dish!!, lasagna - a Italian favorite that does not disappoint as it taste like everything came straight out of a garden so full of flavor and freshness, chicken and veggie pasta - a generous amount of pasta and veggies smothered in a light flavorful sauce.  We are back for more! This time we got the corn dip as an app - heat from the jalape√±os perfectly complements the corn and cheese. We ordered the lasagna and eggplant musaka for this evening. Just as delicious as the first time we came here!!    This place continues to amaze me! Always delicious and flavorful. I will keep coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday evening around 11:30 and while I went with a friend, my first impression of this place was \"Wow, great little romantic place for a date!\". With exposed brick walls, low lighting and some rustic Italian/Baroque charm (think Milan art gallery, not Olive Garden decor). The bar was full and a few booths had people, but we didn't have to wait and got a little booth by a window looking out at the street.  Saturdays they have 1/2 priced martinis so I indulged and got a Honeydew martini as well as a Berry martini and both were amazing. The Berry had over 6 liqueurs in it, so needless to say I was a happy camper only having to pay $4.50 for it!  My friend ordered the Fungi pizza and it was great - the crust wasn't thin like a cracker but was just thick enough to give a great wood grilled taste and allow the fresh ingredients to really speak for themselves. I had the Intermezzo salad (balsamic dressing came on top and it was a BIT oily for my taste) and the veggie lasagna. The lasagna was a spot on choice. I dare say it's the best I've ever had with wood grilled vegetables, an aromatic array of spices, a nice chunky but light marinara and fresh Parmesan on top. Our meal also came out with homemade bread cut into 4 pieces which was just icing on the cake - the bread was just hands down impressive and really a memorable addition to the meal (how often do you get to say that about bread??!?!).  Our server was Trey and he was a great balance between attentive and relaxed, and was so warm it definitely made a great impression on us - we left saying \"Can't wait to go back!\".  Excited to try some of their Eastern European dishes next time...."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Charlotte, I can't believe I hadn't tried it before. Had the Margherita pizza, the ingredients and veggies tasted quality and very fresh. My favorite part was the bread. Also had the garlic twists which were also very good. Christina was our server and she was super attentive and friendly. Great little spot, will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go-to restaurants! Tyler is the absolute best server in Charlotte... the food is amazing, comforting and all homemade!"}
{"text":"Not my piece of pizza.  I had some company at my place and we had craving for pizza. Since I'm still not familiar with charlotte yet, it was suggested we try Intermezzo Pizzeria.  We ordered two large pizzas, the Wood Grilled Fungi and the Chicken Florentine. Personally, I wasn't satisfied. I prefer my pizza, to be real Italian style with a twist of risen and light crust- just a personal preference!  On another note, here are some facts about Intermezzo: - It has been serving Charlotte for 10 years.  - Handmade dough and mozzarella.  - Hand-tossed pizza - Traditional Serbian dishes - They deliver to Uptown, Elizabeth, and the Plaza-Midwood areas!  Three Yelps."}
{"text":"Brought a date here, neither one of us had ever been. The atmosphere was nice, the service was great and the food was excellent! She had the sarma and it was amazing! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Ummmm, my favorite pizza place in Charlotte. Intimate atmosphere, genuinely friendly service, family owned, house made mozzarella, the list goes on. Love it. The veggie lasagna and fungi pizza are my go to's."}
{"text":"Okay, so I was skeptical about this place when we moved to Plaza Midwood 2 years ago.  We tried to eat there twice, but have up because each time the wait was ridiculously long and it didn't feel like it was worth it. Then one night, we decided to order take-out.  Holy moly!!! Best decision ever.  Take-out is almost never as good as when the food is served fresh in front of you, but everything we ordered was phenomenal!  I had pasta carbonara, which was really good.  We have ordered pizza and/or pasta from here several times since then, and each time the food has been spot on!  Surprisingly awesome place, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write this review so that this place stays a hidden gem, but they deserve the praise.   Intermezzo is open late. The service is great and friendly (but not hovering). The food is amazing, especially the Serbian section. Try the:  Steak sandwich Sarma Burek  Piroska  The restaurant is quiet and cozy, with a big patio if you want to sit outside. Did I mention that they always have great music playing? What more could you want?"}
{"text":"This place kills it on Groupon! Always a 1000+ bought! The food and the people are great; I love the blackened chicken pasta and always end it with the strawberry and chocolate crepe! The at atmosphere is semi-intimate depending on where you sit. Definitely check it out if you haven't been."}
{"text":"I like this place, and the atmosphere inside is really cool. The chicken Florentine pizza is great if you wanted a healthier pizza :)"}
{"text":"I guess I am in the minority here. This place is just so so to me. It is a pizzeria/Serbian restaurant. We happened to be in the area and decided to try it. The pizza was average to me. We had a ricotta & goat cheese appetizer which was good. Perhaps the Serbian dishes are better. I also thought the service was lacking. The server didn't explain the menu well, was inattentive and slow to refill  soft drinks & water and forgot to brink another drink ordered.  If I was in this area again, I might stop here to try a Serbian dish, but I would not return for the pizza."}
{"text":"New vegetarian here. It's been difficult to find good food that meets the need. Intermezzo made it easy, their veggie lasagna and garlic knots hot the spot!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today after seeing the restaurant on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  This place definately looked like a dive once I got inside.  Nonetheless, if the food is good, that will overcome the decor.  There were at least 4 open tables in a relatively small restaurant.  As she was talking to another patron, the waitress told me to sit anywhere I wanted.  She promptly took my drink order and after about 10-15 minutes, and again not many patrons in the restaurant, she never came back.  I have limited time for lunch so I had to leave.  I will never go back to this place. There are too many other good restaurants in town that really want new business.  Obviously, this is not one of them.  I eat lunch out every day, and tell everyone that I know my experiences.  I am writing this email to help others avoid wasting their time."}
{"text":"Grilled eggplant was superb! It came with grilled tomato and onions and topped with blue cheese. Also had the Sonoma Cider The Hatchet. Yummmm!! The waiter was good too."}
{"text":"the food was very good here, Italian and Serbian (hey I guess it is just a short trip over the Adriatic Sea).  My daughter had one of the best Chicken Francese dishes ever in a restaurant with a large, soft breaded chicken cutlet over a bed of delicious Rosemary seasoned mashed potatoes. My other daughter has a delicious mushroom pizza and I ordered the Ground Beef Burek (Filo Dough, Ground Beef, Onions) which frankly looked like baked intestines (with a similar concept, coiled tubes) but don't let that gross description dissuade you from ordering it, was quite delicious, also came with a nice salad and a cucumber like sauce on the side.  The portions were also very generous.  The outdoor seating was nice, but near a very busy intersection.  If I lived close by I would sample other items on the menu which seemed very appealing such as the stuffed cabbage and stuffed peppers."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars... verging on 4.5 stars for Intermezzo!  I will definitely come back and try their other menu offerings.  A small group of us went on a chilly Thursday evening.  The bar regulars looked to be out in force but the dining room was pretty quiet.  It did pick up a little towards the end, but I did appreciate the cozy environment, the available art (for sale) on the walls, and the personable and nice service.  Definitely needed a martini to drown out the workday so I asked the barkeep/server if he had recommendations and he recommended the French Martini.  I had been eyeing it on the menu so that's what I went with.  For my dinner, I was determined to order some Serbian delight... and went with the Ground Beef Burek.  It was accompanied by a side of greens with a balsamic drizzle.  Super yummy... it was a big plate of food and I ate it ALL.  Unfortunately didn't have room for dessert based on my entree and my (multiple) martinis.  Overall a great place.  I'm already planning my return trip!  Side Note:  It also helps, being an avid tennis fan (and wannabe player) that the current #1 player in the world Novak Djokovic is Serbian.  Now I doubt this diet regime would include the items offered here to maintain his fitness, but I have no doubt he would totally be eating at Intermezzo whenever (if ever) he comes to Charlotte for some \"home\" cookin'."}
{"text":"Bolognese all damn day. Also really love everyone that works here and eats here. Cool crowd, somewhere you want to be."}
{"text":"Unfriendly waitresses, food just \"OK\", very slow service, very noisy and smoky on the patio from traffic. We were a big group (10), and 20% of gratuity were automatically added to our check, that's why no efforts were made from the waitresses. I really don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service was awesome as was the pizza but the crepe was EVERYTHING. The best I've ever had. I've passed this place a million times but never stopped. I'm glad we decided to pop in tonight. The owner was friendly and Trey was knowledgeable and offered tips on the menu and took his time explaining the items to us as first timers. Everything is fresh and made in house daily."}
{"text":"My go-to for neighborhood pizza! I probably eat here at least three times a month.  Their goat cheese crostini is the BEST and their pasta is so fresh you will never be able to eat the dried stuff again.  The owners are so nice and hardworking and the food is consistently delicious.  Bonus: if you live in the area they deliver.  Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza there last weekend - and sadly they lost a star. While it was better than your local Dominoes or that yucky Papa John's people in NC seem to enjoy ...it wasn't as good as Hawthornes or even Fuel in my opinion. The sauce was kind of bland-could have used garlic or something and truthfully the cheese pizza lacked cheesiness. Instead of being gooey and melty - it kind of seemed too baked on. I'd go here for the Serbian fare but no pizza for me next time."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place on a Sunday night and noticed this was one of the only places open, thank God!  Pizza was excellent. Service was very good. Would definitely like to return for the Serbian food, sounds as good as the pizza!"}
{"text":"Cool little place, but one of those that leaves you wondering what to order (and the staff isn't much help). If you have the ability to read a review first, then it seems that Serbian is a better way to go - but the name would suggest they are a pizza joint.  Unfortunately, the pizza is just not the greatest. It's certainly decent, and the atmosphere is solid, but it's definitely not what you expect. If you go for Serbian, your experience may definitely differ."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and the first time I got the Cajun chicken pasta. It was really good and flavorful. Came with broccoli and onions mixed in. The second time I got it, they didn't have the onions in it which I thought was weird. We sat in the closed patio area and service was very slow. Literally took 5 mins for our drink order and another 10 mins for our actual order. I think the server had tables inside and outside the patio. Drinks were never filled or asked if we wanted more drinks at the bar. Food took forever, over 30 mins. Other than that, the food is good for the most part and depending on your server, you might get good or bad service."}
{"text":"favorite pizza spot in charlotte but it is pricey"}
{"text":"Since I live near this restaurant I really wanted it to be great. It wasn't. In fact, I'll probably never go again. Both of our orders were cold when they were brought out and even if they had been hot, I don't think they would have been that special. The decor our waitress were nice, but the food was sub par. It's a shame since this location changes ownership so frequently, but this place is destined not to last."}
{"text":"Food was superb. I had the Chicken Francses with asparagus and rosemary mashed potatoes. The service was was on point. Very attentive and accommodating staff. Half price wine on Tuesday. I am a visitor to Charlotte and come from a food town."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place. I've been eating here for a year or so and I used to love them. Used to.   The food was really phenomenal. Everything I ordered was delicious, from the appetizers to the burgers to the traditional Serbian dishes. I'd get a hankering and try something new every so often and it never disappointed.... until recently.  Several months ago, the incorrect dish was delivered to me, and I'd barely even opened the food before the guy showed up again with the correct dish and apologized. Wow. I told him it wasn't necessary in this case, or I would have called, but he insisted that they had to get me the right order because of who I was (loyal customer). I was really touched by how concerned they were with getting the exact order right. Great food, great customer service - what more could you ask for?   A few months after that, things just tanked. Things were left out of our order - I called to let them know and said it wasn't a big deal, but FYI. The second time, I asked for their tomato sauce. That stuff was seriously delicious the first time I had it - so I wanted some more without having to order an entire dish of it. I called and totally offered to pay extra. They charged me $3.50 and I got the equivalent of, like, 2 ketchup packets of sauce. Really? That is super chintzy. This last order (offense number three), we got the stuffed peppers and the weinerschnitzel. It was the smallest piece of meat they'd ever made for us in over a year. On top of that, we were given one small pepper, instead of the two that normally come in an order. We paid $15 for one single medium-sized stuffed pepper? To make matters worse, the taste of this insanely expensive tomato sauce was just not the same. Did they change chefs?   I called and was nice about it, but just was wondering what the heck was going on. I was told I'd get a call back and I never did. I don't know what's happening with Intermezzo, but they've gone from possibly my favorite place to eat in Charlotte to one of the worst amount-of-food-for-your-money ratio and with zero customer service."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I think this is the first time I've had Serbian food. And I'm a fan, thanks Intermezzo!   Not only does Intermezzo have a great patio, with plenty of fans mind you, they sport a cozy interior and a really unique menu of pizzas and Serbian items I haven't indulged in before. I popped in here for a quick lunch with a friend and while I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich, I had a severe case of food envy when I saw my friend's dish come out - the ground beef burek. It looked like a pretzel roll and a beef slider had a baby. And she was quite pleased with it too!  Onto my sandwich, two pieces of delicious crusty bread hugged wood fired squash, portabella mushrooms, asparagus, zucchini, tomatoes. The best part though? The incredible goat cheese spread that was thinly layered beneath the veggies - I would like that in a cup, please. I chose the roasted potatoes as my side - nice and toasty, with a pleasant crisp. Prices and service were both friendly and I definitely want to head back and try a myriad of their Serbian dishes. And maybe a pizza. Times two."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but our service in the bar was kind of unfriendly. Followed next was slow and irritated service on the patio. It took 10 minutes to receive our menus, from a server who seemed frazzled and upset.  However, the whole experience was wonderful because I had lovely company. Had I just been here to experience the restaurant and not my guests I would have been extremely disappointed and dissatisfied by the service. However, it's cute and delish so I still would recommend it."}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant. Nice outside seating right next to the street. Inside is small but quaint. There is a full bar. It is clear when you get your food that it's home made here and not a chain. We got a supreme pizza. Huge and hand tossed. Fresh toppings enough for 4 and still brought some home  In a past visit we got the Sarma. Served in a light sauce. Wanted it again but was sold out. The becka snicia is very European and also good but order lots of lemons to give it more flavor and moisture  Parking can be a little tough when busy Worth a try, really good food"}
{"text":"Never been here before so I tried it with a groupon.  Whole experience was excellent!  The food the service both were outstanding!  Our waiter Georgie (sp) one of the owners was extremely nice and full of personality and very helpful throughout.    We started with the corn dip, it's was sweet and flavorful with a hint of spice, the tortilla chips were average and a little too salty but overall still a great appetizer.   My girlfriend and I shared a 10\" pizza and the beef burek and they were both great.  The pizza was a Capriccioso which is basically meat lovers and was excellent, could stand alone as just a pizza place for me.  The beef burek was also very good.  I didn't know what to expect it was my first experience with Serbian food but it was a nice surprise.  It was meticulously stuffed fillo dough made from scratch and had good flavor, we were encouraged to try a bite of it with the cucumber mixture and the salad and it was quite good but I enjoyed it by itself also.  Finished with crepes for dessert and again owner went out of his way I have a hazel nut allergy so he made one regular crepe for my girlfriend and one crepe for me using a different chocolate sauce.   We will surely be back and happy to pay regular price but will also be on the lookout for future groupons as this place was a hit!  Speaking of groupon they made it super easy to redeem and did so with a smile on their face!"}
{"text":"Pizza plus old world Serbian fare? That equation may sound odd, but it feels so right. And delicious.   I think I've had almost everything on the menu. It's all pretty good. Their pizza is some of my favorite in Charlotte. I like both the Capriccioso and Intermezzo Supreme. App wise, the bruschetta is great. I love how the housemade Mozzarella is melted over the tomatoes. Portabella mushroom tower is yummy as well, just note that it's a smaller size starter. The shopska is a good salad-like option to share. The eggplant musaka and cabbage rolls are delicious. I think the Piroska is a hidden star on this menu. It's kind of like stuffed pizza or calzone type dish. I always add spinach to mine.   You can order online via their website for pick up or delivery. They do half priced wine on Wednesdays. The patio has a nice view of the skyline. Gah, our city is so pretty.   I've known Branko and Djordje since back in their days of working at Cosmos a decade ago. They are hard workers, take a lot of pride in what they do, and are just great people in general. So proud of them and all they are doing at Intermezzo."}
{"text":"I ate here last week with a friend using a Groupon. The food was already surprisingly affordable, but I really impressed with how fresh and flavorful the appetizers and entrees were (had garlic twists, chicken francese, and portabella mushroom tower) given the price of the food. The server was fantastic, and the atmosphere of the place was pretty mellow, in line with the whole Plaza Midwood area. Definitely will be back again. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Many thanks to Yelp for introducing me to a restaurant I likely never would have ventured to otherwise!   The reviews for Intermezzo were great, so my expectations were high. I met 2 friends here on one of those uncharacteristically warm, still technically winter, Charlotte days, just to give you an idea of the perfection I had ingrained in my mind.   Intermezzo did NOT disappoint. It met my high standards, and then some. As I waited for my friends to arrive, I caught a whiff of, what I believe was the Garlic Braided Twist appetizer. Must try them next time. They smelled UNREAL.   We began with the antipasto plate and Portobello Mushroom Tower. They were both great! I loved the assortment of meats and cheeses, and the goat cheese on the Mushroom Tower was so creamy and just, perfect really. Next time, I will ask for a bread basket.   I ordered the Sarma (Cabbage Rolls) as my entree. With all of the amazing sounding Serbian dishes on the menu, I figured, do as the Serbians do! I may as well have licked my plate.   One friend ordered a pizza. She raved! I was too busy wolfing down Sarma and my other friend's food to get a bite. The other dish I tried was the Blackened Chicken Pasta. The menu's description doesn't sound that enticing, but I was in chili powder heaven. It was subtly spicy, smoky, creamy, rich...   Ok--remind me not to write restaurant reviews when I haven't had my lunch. GO TO INTERMEZZO!"}
{"text":"Wow. So incredibly lame. I ordered delivery off of chownow and it never came. The restaurant never answered the calls and I had to call chownow for a refund, who also couldn't get a hold of them.  Keep searching for another place as you may starve before you realize your food is never coming."}
{"text":"Used my Groupon ticket here - picked it up on a whim and it was well worth it.  Ordered the special of the day - Chicken, Shrimp, Chicken, Mussels, Andouille Sausage on Saffron Rice cooked with Peppers.  My friend ordered the veggie lasagna.  I didn't try his veggie lasagna, bc we were already eating dinner together and it seemed fruity to do so! I'm insecure ;]  Food was delicious.  It tasted very good and served in reasonable portions.  It definitely had a home-cooked feel to it which for some reason always hits the belly a little better than \"restaurant\" food.  It was like fireworks going off in my mouth - the way the melange of flavors were distinct, yet blended well.  One word to describe it would be: Elegant - defined as \"simple but genius\"  Service was attentive and informative.  I didn't even finish my diet Coke, I mean, Coke Zero (manlier) and server had my next one ready (kinda just had to drink it bc it was prepared)  How did this place miss out on 5 stars?  Dishes were slightly overpriced. Slight meaning like $1 or $1.50 overpriced.  Will I come here again? Absolutely.  I recommend it highly as it is a perfect blend of home-cooked and deliciousness.  Parking lot sucks - it's gravel ;/  dmo out"}
{"text":"Loved the food! We sat on the patio. I was a little afraid all of the traffic noise would take away from our experience but it did not. Our waiter was awesome! My bfs son talks sports all day. The waiter always had a witty come back and kept him entertained. The pizza is huge and delish! We shall return!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte! 'Nuff said.  The Burrek is yummy and goes well with a glass of Blanche De Brussels beer."}
{"text":"Creative great food, funky Plaza Midwood vibe. Our regular Friday night date place. Don't get our table:)"}
{"text":"Intermezzo is a lesser known gem in Plaza Midwood. It looks rather unassuming on the corner of 10th and Louise but is definitely worth the trip.   This was my third time going to Intermezzo. The first was to score some sweet happy hour deals (which are in fact, sweet including half priced appetizers) and the second was a pizza delivery when mom was in town (let's talk about how it was super quick because I'm just up the street and the pizza was piping hot and delish).   Tonight we were fortunate enough to drop in on half price martini night. I will not complain about a martini that is only $4.50. I had the peach nectar which was good, really sweet, but only had a subtle hint of booze.  For dinner, I had the Intermezzo Supreme pizza. It's a solid pizza with all kinds of toppings, a hearty crust and delicious cheese. It was so good it was hard to put down (luckily I had enough self control to bring some leftovers home). My friend had the crepe (I appreciate her dessert for dinner approach) and I stole a few bites, and that was also excellent.   Prices are definitely reasonable. 10 inch pizza and a drink for under 20 bucks. I'll definitely be going back. A lot."}
{"text":"Still 5 star quality.  I ordered eggplant moussaka like always and had it delivered to me.  It's not a cheap meal, but it is sooo delicious.  Upon opening it, I noticed it was a very tiny portion, which is NOT usual.  I have been ordering here for 7 years, and have never had this issue.  I called just to let them know it was a little disappointing, but still delicious.  The owner drove BACK to my house herself and delivered another one free of charge.  You never get quality service like that anymore.  I was so thrilled and surprised.  My favorite place in Charlotte still, now even more.  They truly care about their customers."}
{"text":"Took us, what, 2 years to finally get over here? Laaaaaame.  Comfily-dark lighting, high ceilings, back-friendly booths, and the smell of that wood-burning pizza oven = instachill. One of the best environs in the area for the full package: ze dreeenking, eating, and talking.   Food? Eh. Had the entire veg range at this point, and the peak was the Lasagna (which was awesome). Don't get me wrong, it's all better than OK - but as I'm eating my pizza funghi, I'm wishing for stronger flavor, and leaning on the salt shaker. My piroska is breadier than I imagined, and I end up sipping beer with each bite to get my kicks. What I want is to be distracted from their awesome pours (hello, Unibroue! I've missed you!!) for even just a second by something noshable. And guys, a little salt never hurt nobody.  Does it matter? Nah. Service is awesome. Space is 5stars+. So the food has some wiggle room. But what if..."}
{"text":"A hard to navigate corner heading into Plaza Midwood, but once you get there, there's delicious pizza and Serbian food waiting for you. Their plates are huge and you'll definitely have leftovers to take home.   This trip, we came on a Saturday night. My husband got a large pizza and I got the Breca something (it was breaded pork cutlet). My husbands pizza was full of veggies and meat on every slice and he couldn't have been happier. My meal was extremely dry, and I asked for olive oil to help. Our (wonderful) server said that the Serbs eat this meal with the creamed spinach on top of the pork. I wish it would have been served that way, or I was told how to eat it when it came to the table because I couldn't get past the dryness, but the spinach did help!   This is definitely a spot to check out and expand your pallet on (or stay in the safe zone with their traditional fare)!"}
{"text":"Great casual restaurant \"downtown\" but out of the way in a thriving neighborhood. Enjoyed sitting at the bar and chatting with one of the co-owners, Broncho, who brought recipes from Serbia to share. I was very comfortable and well sated without feeling stuffed at all."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. So, so salad. Attentive and friendly service. Great music. Most of all amazing Pizza. I am from out of town and have been all over the world eating Pizza. This place knows Pizza. Try the Spinach and ricotta cheese. Delish. I would consider moving to Charlotte to eat this pizza once a week. BRAVO!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner experience here. We came in on a weekday around 8 pm. We were greeted by a host and immediately seated. Our waiter, Trey, approached our table quickly and made great drink recommendations. I was going to start with a Blue Moon, but he recommended some beer (something of Brussels, I think). It was awesome!   For dinner, we started by sharing some of their homemade bread. It was warm, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. For entrees, we both resisted our urge to go with something tradition and instead opted for some of their Serbian dishes. I had the piroska and added spinach and onions. I was hesitant about the sour cream but it was delicious. My boyfriend had the karadjordjeva and he loved it! He described it as similar to chicken cordon bleu. I had hoped to have room for a Nutella crepe but was far too full.   Great food. Great drinks. Great service.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place!  The atmosphere is enjoyable, the service is ALWAYS great, and the food cannot be beat!  Consistently delicious and reasonably priced.  This restaurant is especially enjoyable with large groups.  Thanks, Tre, for ensuring that we always have a good experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Italian and Serbian dishes. I had the blackened chicken pasta, it was amazing! Aside from having trouble which door was the entrance, we loved this place. good atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Great food. good prices"}
{"text":"As a vegan, they were very accommodating in making a special vegan pizza on a crust with no egg."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places in Charlotte, and here's why... - they really do make the best pizzas! Pick any from their list - you can't go wrong. - delicious traditional Serbian dishes (nothing healthy about 'em :) but so worth all the calories!) - comfortable, casual environment - super friendly staff - and they deliver to uptown!! so for those lazy evenings, when you're craving something delicious, you can order one of their perfectly created pizzas. i'm not sure if the magic is in the dough or in the sauce or toppings, but the pizzas are magical :)"}
{"text":"Pizza here is top notch, owner is pretty funny, and the chicken francese is off the charts. For some reason I thought ordering grilled eggplant was a good idea, obviously it wasnt, but at least i wasnt too full. Definitely reccomended and I might even feel comfy enough to eat solo at the bar here in the future."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The atmosphere is laid-back & casual with a cool upscale feel. The bar is centrally located.  Not many tables inside, but more seating is available on the patio when weather permits.  We came here on a Saturday night last winter. Every table was full, so we sat at the bar. The pizza looked great, but we wanted to try Serbian dishes.  The bartender (owner?) was friendly and fun and helped us decide what to eat.  We started with the shopska salad. Tomatoes were not in season, and the bartender apologized for that, but the salad was dressed well and the feta cheese (sheep's milk) was delicious. Then we ordered and split the spinach burek and cabbage rolls - hearty, hot, wonderful flavors. Both were really great and the sauces were incredible. The bread was dense and crusty.  I think this is a special place and I would love to go back! It will be hard to not order that same meal all over again ..."}
{"text":"To be fair, I didn't have any of the coveted Serbian dishes that make up the true soul of this place, but I'm really looking forward to returning here to do so. A group of 7 of us came here after going to an event at The Filmore, and we were hangry for some carbs. Pizza you say? That sounds like an amazing idea. Intermezzo it is!  We were seated promptly at one of the tables in the patio (covered and heated, so we weren't frigid). The service was quick and really helpful, I ordered the personal size of the veggie pizza (Garden Fresh) that was loaded with broccoli, mushrooms, and other veggies and had...*gulp* smoked gouda cheese. Let me tell you, I haven't been more excited to eat leftovers since the last time I went to a japanese steakhouse. All pizzas at the table were excellent! I can't wait to go back and try more dishes from them, and experience the Serbian side of things. In the meantime, please go and try their pizza, yelp!"}
{"text":"Good food, cool atmosphere, outdoor seating and drink specials!  Check it out..."}
{"text":"Had the blackened chicken pasta and everything about it was very good, especially the sauce. It had a more robust and smoky flavor than many similar pastas that I have had. I recommend ordering the house-baked bread to go with it. At $1.50, the spongy pocket bread paired nicely with the pasta. 10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"Date night at Intermezzo!  Our hostess did not ask us if we preferred indoor or outdoor seating.  She proceeded to seat us at a table off to the side, which had hard card table style chairs.  The table itself was on a slope, and I felt like I was at the top of the hill and my husband was at the bottom.  We asked to be moved and were accommodated by the hostess, who appeared to be harried. Our new table sported chairs that were more comfortable. We ordered the Quattro fromagio pizza.  It appeared to be dry and over cooked, with some of the crust darkened, however, it was edible.  But, hey, it was date night!  We still had a good time!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this simple.  We were here for pizza and really that is all.  The place has a nice vibe...active, bustling, energizing.  We had to wait about 15 minutes on a Friday night which isn't too bad.  We sat down, received pretty good service and ordered a couple 10 inch pizzas.    They were good!  I don't remember the names but one had bacon on it and mine had chicken, tomatoes and goat cheese I think.  The toppings were minimal therefore unmemorable.  The crust was good but the pizza slices were a little greasy and so the tip of the pizza was flapped over...just a personal pet peeve.    The prices were a little high for what you get but probably market.  I don't know..everything was just OK.  I could easily go to Harris Teeter and pick up Amy's margarita pizza in the frozen section and be just as satisfied.  There were other things on the menu that looked decent but I just wasn't overly impressed.  It gets a solid 3 stars for my whole experience."}
{"text":"Our visit here was unplanned but I am SO glad we found it!  We stopped around lunchtime.  We had the choice to sit outside (very nice looking patio area) or inside.  We opted for inside since the pollen is AWFUL right now.  Julie waited on us.  The menu didn't have any kids items but she told me that they are happy to make kids pasta with sauce or butter or cheese (or all of the above.)  She got my daughters order in immediately so she wouldn't starve.    I had a pizza and my wife had blackened chicken pasta.  We all loved what we got.  I'm talking DELICIOUS.  And Julie was awesome and kept our drinks refilled.    Overall i would rate it as one of our favorites."}
{"text":"After months I finally made it to Intermezzo. I decided to try a variety of items, to get a good idea of their food. I started with a house salad. House salad is lettuce, carrots, cucumber and onion with a balsamic dressing. The salad was good, but nothing great.  After the salad I had the bruschetta and chicken and vegetable soup. The bruschetta was amazing, toasted homemade bread with tomatoes and cheese. I did ask for a side of marinara for dipping and that made it amazing! As for the soup, chicken and veggies, carrots, zucchini, onion and corn, served in a light broth. Very nice and served perfectly warm. Service was on point and I found the environment very friendly and welcoming. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered lasagna.  Top portion was cold and lasagna had a cheap taste like it came from the frozen food aisle at the grocery store.  Needless to say, I won't be back"}
{"text":"So we drive by this place all the time but had not tried it until recently and I wish we hadn't waited so long! They have a great happy hour with half price apps and they have a solid selection of local beers. They have the best eggplant we have ever had in a restaurant it is a nice thick cut that has not been breaded and deep fried like most places! Amazing you must try it:) everyone we were with loved their meals and we sat out side and enjoyed the view of uptown."}
{"text":"Casual dining, but everything is just so yummy! I was looking for something outside the usual to show my mom the range of eateries in Charlotte and Intermezzo hit the buttons for different. Serbian. And close to uptown for a look at the lights.  Greeted warmly, we took a table inside. Not the widest menu, but the choices were excellent.  We started with the garlic twists. Excellent choice - light and fluffy with a marinara sauce to dip in. All gone! For the mains, since my mom is a veggie, she had the vegetarian lasagna and really enjoyed it. I went with the stuffed cabbage and wow, it was excellent. Thick cabbage leaves with a spicy (not hot spicy, this is tasty spicy) ground beef and rice mix in a broth that was served with a loaf of homemade bread. I used up all the bread to soak up the fab broth.  For dessert, we went with the fruit stuffed crepes. Fresh (not frozen) strawberries and banana slices with a hazlenut chocolate drizzle.  There was some fighting involved for the last bit.  Interesting beer choices, I had a Belgian wheat beer that was excellent.  Strong recommendation! Great food, nice ambiance!"}
{"text":"The idea of a Serbian restaurant was enough to entice me to purchase the Groupon to check it out, especially since I had never really thought about what Serbian cuisine was about. We headed to Intermezzo before hitting up The Comedy Zone and walked away impressed with the place.  Intermezzo does not look like much from the outside, but don't let the old building and gravel parking lot scare you...they serve up some decent grub. The interior is pretty neat with exposed brick walls and shelves of all these little miniature toys. The interior dining area is small but not cramped, and the outdoor patio area looked to add a lot more space, weather permitting. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and got us going with our drinks. I got a draft of Founder's Porter ($5) and the miss' got a Cantaloupe Martini ($4.50 on a 1/2 off martini Saturday.)   For an appetizer we started with the Corn Dip ($8.75) which was a bit pricey for what you got. It was a small ramekin of corn niblets mixed with peppers, onions and cheese. The ramekin must have been placed in a salamander before coming out because the cheese topping crustified, much like a french onion soup would. Once we got everything mixed around it was pretty tasty paired with the tortilla chips, but it definitely wasn't $8.75 worthy. It was really surprising because the rest of the appetizers, and even the entrees, were reasonably priced, so I don't know what made a bunch of corn and cheese so expensive in comparison.  For dinner, after seeing all the rave reviews here on Yelp, I had to go with the Ground Beef Burek ($11.95.) It is a huge roll made of fillo dough, but not the fillo dough I'm used to. It was denser and crunchier than what I've had in Greek-style cheese pies and other foods, and it worked as a great exterior crust to the contents inside. It was filled with tons of a ground beef and onion mixture, and that was it. No sauce, no seasoning, just pure beef and sauteed onion. I think it was missing a little something initially, but I added some tzatziki sauce on top and that gave it a bit of umph it was initially missing. It also came with a decent-sized side salad of greens, tomato and cucumber with a balsamic dressing. The veggies were nice and fresh and the dressing had a nice sweetness to it.  The missus ordered the Cheese & Spinach Burek ($11.95) and I'm surprised to say that I liked hers more. The cheese consisted of ricotta so it was similar to a calzone filling, and the spinach was not obtrusive at all. In fact, I would go so far as to say that a burek that contained both ground beef and this cheese mixture would be a slam dunk hole in one home run goal.   Intermezzo is a pretty great restaurant that takes pride in their food. They also do pizzas and I am looking forward to returning in the near future to give them a whirl. Definitely worth checking out. One last note, I saw a guy running around doing deliveries so if you live nearby that may be a great option."}
{"text":"Intermezzo is a fantastic place to come grab dinner and drinks with friends.  I went last time I was in Charlotte and I will be sure to come back at some point when I am in town.  Me and a friend split a large pizza, which they allowed us to customize so it was half Capriccioso and half Spinach Supreme.  It was fantastic pizza, much better quality than I was expecting.  The ambiance was nice and there was a great beer special which made the evening more fun.  I recommend this place.  If you are looking for a fun place with great food but not too pricey you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Got the veggie pizza. Light and delicious.  Great service. Very cool environment and location."}
{"text":"Yummy with healthy Italian/Mediterranean type food. Every time I come here I get something different and I am never disappointed. I met two friends here, a couple, and I was first to arrive. Ha this time the hostess almost sat me with someone I didn't know, and newly single I told her she was trying to be a match maker.   We ordered the corn dip as an appetizer and pretty darn good. They also have hummus and many others, but I wanted to save room for pizza! I had not tried it yet. Oh and it was delicious! We got the Spinach pizza and talk about heaven. Oh and you  can get a ready cook pizza of your choice to take home and bake if you like.  I've never had a bad experience here, lasagna, did I just say that? Yeah that's my other fav here. Service is awesome and I will be back here again soon. As with all Plasma Wig wood places parking is slim, especially in weekend nights.   I hope everyone enjoys this place as much as I have. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"After having the pizza here (it was great), I came back to try the Serbian food and it was just as good or better than the pizza.  The roasted red pepper bruschetta was the best bruschetta I have ever had.  The house made mozzarella and balsamic vinegar are incredible.  For dinner, I tried the beef burek.  It looks like a honey bun and tastes amazing (also very filling).  As good as the beef burek was, the Karadjordjeva was even better.  It is extremely tender and the Kajmak cheese and dill tartar sauce make it amazing.  If you want takeout and/or pizza, I highly recommend ordering your pizza from here.  It is the best I have had so far in Charlotte.  If you would rather eat at the restaurant, the food (aside from the pizza) is incredible as well.  Service is good and prices are fair, so the value is strong as well."}
{"text":"I will break it down, but in terms of service, food, and atmosphere this place was great! I would recommend it to anyone.   My dad and I went here one night because we love to try out the restaurants featured on DDD. We were confused and intrigued by the combination of Italian and Serbian, but willing to give it a try.   In terms of the split, they have a list of apps that pull from both cuisines. Then a list of about 10 pizzas - which were freakin' amazeballs, we got the capriccioso - a handful of Serbian entrees (we are Armenian so that was a real treat), a list of about 5 different pasta dishes, and an EXTENSIVE \"martini\" list. The martinis are really just cocktails, but still delicious in their own right. On the consumables front they get straight A's.   Also, our waiter Steve was so great. He went above and beyond great customer service and genuinely seemed enthusiastic about working there. He also was the perfect balance of helpful, attentive, and giving us some space. I'm not sure if all the wait staff is of the same caliber, but either way the food is more than worth it.   The only down side I would say is that it is very small. We went pretty late on a Wednesday evening, so we didn't have to worry much about crowds. But I can definitely see this place filling up quickly on Saturdays for the $5 martini special."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with the food here. The dinner specials are always delicious. An entree that's always on the menu and is a definite win is the Chicken Francese. You have GOT to try it. I just tried the pizza for the first time the other night since I had heard great things and it was really good. Interesting combination of foods on the menu but it all seems to work together. The only problem I've ever had here is that the servers seem to be stretched thin sometimes so it may take an extra minute for drinks or to order your food. Not a huge issue for me. Bottom line: I love Intermezzo!"}
{"text":"I love when a groupon find correlates with a pleasant dinning experience. On a late night friday we decided to put my Groupon addiction to good use. I have passed this place a million times and finally decided to check it out.  We sat outside, a personal favorite of mine. Perfect late summer evening idea. I've  never eaten Serbian food, so I'm glad our waiter was knowledgeable and helpful with suggestions.   Based on the recommendations, Colin got the Karadjordjeva Pan Seared Schnitzel rolled with Ham, Kajmak, Skillet Potatoes, and Tartar Sauce. it was great. I ordered on the side of caution with the Chicken Francese. It was heavenly. Walking out to our car, after enjoying our dinner, we made a last minute move to get some Tiramisu to go. Oh Man, I'm so glad we did, a little bit on the Pricey side, but it was AmaZing.  A good tip to keep in mind, this place is open Late, until 2am!"}
{"text":"OMG!! Can't tell you how many times we've passed this place up for a more comfortable already been to place. Well tonight we took the leap!! And I'll never regret it!! There was maybe 5 people in the place besides staff but the phone rang off the hook for delivery while we were there. Took a little bit  to get our appetizer but then we learned this is truly a farm to table restaurant. Everything is fresh made. They have no freezers in the restaurant. I'm telling you it was the best marinara I've ever had.. for a small place they have a great draft beer list including 2 high gravity ones tonight.. I'm still in awe as to how great our meal was. As for all the triple D places we've ate at in Charlotte.. this one definitely is the best ever!! Hands down!!"}
{"text":"Service at this restaurant has declined. This was my go to place every-time I visited the area before making it my home. The food was so good and service so pleasant, but not anymore. Place has a funny odor now, never going back again."}
