{"text":"I had the daily special where you combine a BLT sandwich and a piece of pie. I don't have to mention that the pie was great but actually; the sandwich was not bad either. Friendly staff and a nice neighborhood adds to a great experience."}
{"text":"Delicious pie and also great soup and salad deal. I got the rockaberry my first time and went for a Carmel type my second time, you really can't go wrong. Also the hot coco is great."}
{"text":"Rockaberry's is a well-established hang out spot in the West Island (You do have some downtown, but I never go).   It started with the one on Sources (in D.D.O.) and now I mostly go to the one on St-Charles (between the 40 and 20). Both have outdoor terraces, but the one on St-Charles is bigger and more enjoyable in my opinion.   They have great sangria (white and red) to enjoy, are known for their desserts: amazing pies that you can't find anywhere else in Montreal. Apple crumble pie, Apple crumble cheesecake (one of their newest), Raspberry crumble pie, Truffle, Toblerone cheesecake, Orea cheesecake, you name it, you can find your fix here. They also have excellent nachos to share (and the appetizer one is great and more than enough for 2). Their clubs are also awesome.  A lot of people study there too! It's '''the more upscale study place of the West'''' haha. Good times, food and hockey game in the background. The fun thing about the one on Sources, they have a fireplace. Studying is good but it can get super loud (like nightclub) around 8. Not too pleasant. Even if just to go without studying, hard to hear each other speak.   But all around a fun place worth going to!"}
{"text":"Rockaberry is the place to go when you want a cheap, giant serving of dessert. Great for sugarholics."}
{"text":"Like it here! Great sandwiches, and pie. Although the service is hit or miss. One lady here gave me attitude once. There is a cute terrace that is nice in the summer. It is reasonably priced, regular restaurant fare. 10-20$ a person. Would recommend for a nice casual dinner or lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is good for big groups and has two floors of seating. All 20+ of us took up half the second floor! The waitress was nice and was good in taking all of our orders. Water was a little slow in being refilled though.  The portions were decently sized. My friend and I shared a key lime pie and were barely able to finish it. It tasted great! It was a lot of sugar to take in though. Another friend also shared her berry cobbler (I think that's what it was?), and that tasted fantastic! It was less sweet than the key lime pie we had, so I prefer the berry cobbler instead. It's a bit pricey though; my friend and I paid $8 for our generous slice of pie. They were also good in handling all our separate checks.  Great dessert place to hang out at!  EDIT: Came back again with almost the same group. My new favorites are the Rockabrownie Pie and French Onion Soup!"}
{"text":"je donne une étoile à cet endroit uniquement parce que zéro n'est pas une option. Les serveurs et serveuses sont tellement snob et prennent de grands airs devabt les clients. Les tartes, on s'entend elles ne peuvent pas être décevantes, elles sont fournies par une compagnie, c'est juste dommage que le service à la clientel soit aussi merdique."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the 90's...  Back in the day, this place was so popular, somewhat like Juliette and Chocolat of it's day. It still has some darn good pies. My fave is the mille feuilles, I had a oreo period, banana split, oh yeah. Sadly banana split is no more, they replaced it with banana cake (cough crap cough).  I think this place is due for an update on the pies, I think we've all been here so many times, and ate them pies so many times, even though it's still good, it doesn't wow anymore... it's still packed when we went, but it feels stale and I'm a bit sad about it..."}
{"text":"They have great pies, but I wouldn't even call most of their \"pies\" pies.  Some of them, like the caramel apple crumb cheesecake, are just zany and delicious concoctions.  All of their cheesecake-type \"pies\" are really good.  The straight-up pies are also good, but pale in comparison to the cheesecake type.  They also have pretty good meals, but the desserts are definitely the star here.  I would suggest you go in a small group as there isn't much seating.  If it is full, no need to fret just get a pie to go!"}
{"text":"The apple crumb pie is simply amazing. It certainly gets 5 stars from me! The owners are very friendly and welcoming as well. I sort of feel like Norm from Cheers whenever they see me and yet I am not even there that often. They are very nice and friendly guys. I also loved my Smoked salmon wrap. It hit the spot."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and excellent desserts! We stopped in for a late afternoon snack and enjoyed the ambiance of this new establishment. The pie was delicious, as well was the latte. I would definitely come back for a late night dessert or cocktail."}
{"text":"Ok thought this was only a bakery but guess what ? You can enjoy your cheesecake with an apple martini and I did just that! It was delicious, great location, good services!"}
{"text":"I have heard many good mentions and reviews about this local pie shop. On a Saturday night around 9:30, with nothing better to do, we decided to call our Uber and head down to this local legend to grab a slice of pie and tea, possibly. Our uber arrived, we got in and Kyle asked for me to play my beats. I took out an aux cord and we drove. We arrive and are instantly greeted to the cozy looking small cafe. We are seated after about 5 minutes at a two person table, for three. After about 10 minutes our orders are placed and we are patiently awaiting the pies. Two coffees and three slices of pie were ordered, two caramel fudge and a millefeuille to be exact. 15 minutes pass and our drinks arrive, only to delay our pies, which are clearly visible in the glass display at the front of the cafe. Finally our pies arrive and they look absolutely delicious. Unsurprisingly, they taste just as good, and the myth lives up to its tale, they truly are filling. We finish our pies and chat for a little while waiting for our  bills to arrive. 15$ for a slice of pie and a latte. Seriously rockaberry, your food was delicious, but 8$ for a slice of pie is too mtuch."}
{"text":"Nice place where you can grab a piece of pie with a hot cappuccino. Their lunch food is not too good though, the type you can find in a cafeteria at a hospital. For dessert, definatly worth it!"}
{"text":"Decadence on a dish.  You could go for a meal, but I wouldn't suggest it; you don't want to fill up too much before you hit the pie.  Honestly, the pie is sufficient to be a meal in itself.... Or more precisely, a slice of pie could be my only meal of the day.  It's that rich.  Good, but rich.  Super, super rich.  The cheesecake pies in particular are incredible.  They usually consist of a cookie crust filled with a thick, cheesecake-like custard chock full of peanut butter, chocolate, candy bars, caramel, etc.  They custard is topped with thick clouds of whipping cream then garnishes with more \"extras\".  The whole thing stands about 4-5\" high and is a fearful meal to tackle.  I've never made it through an entire one.  The lemon meringue pie is also decent.  The filling is a little too sweet for my tastes; I was looking for something a bit more tart to contrast the airy, sugary meringue that floats on top.  I've had better, but I've also had much worse.  I haven't yet tried the fruit pies, but I've heard rave reviews.  The service is so-so.  We were seated quickly when we arrived, but it took a very long time for the waitress to come and take our order.  Also, after being served, we didn't see the waitress until we hailed someone for the check.  I could have used about 5 glasses of water in that time period.    Overall though, this is a great place for dessert.  It meets all my requirements for decadent deliciousness, at a decent price."}
{"text":"I was in the area, craving some moist cake. Ordered the strawberry spongecake and a bottle of Pellegrino (15$ tax-in). The cake I ordered was great- everything you want a slice to taste like; flavour, and texture wise. Service was good with no prolonged waiting, but I asked for the check right away after ordering to avoid an almost certain wait for a bill- which I recommend you do, as well to save time and aggravation- especially on busy nights. Avoid sitting by the women's wash room, it smells like a dirty moist mop or sweaty socks, at times. Too bad, considering the nice fireplace that is close to this area. Another observation, the cutlery for an 8-10$ piece of cake is ugly, cheap and unsexy to use on such a delightful desserts. Besides being too large, my fork looked liked it had been used in a prison cafeteria for 20years, then flattened by a truck. They need cutlery that is more proportionate to the food (if I go back, I will ask if they have a salad fork or coffee spoon)- I shouldn't be able to shovel the cake down in three bites. Little bites... think little bites; it's more enjoyable for dessert. Besides that, the parking is widely available in front and there might be lineups to get a table on weekends. Noise level is also significantly increased, which is natural considering that , unlike Starbucks, Rockaberry serves alcohol. So when it comes to choosing your seat, beware of \"twinzees\" bashing their ex-bfs over martinis and cake. Deadly combination."}
{"text":"Tout a l'air tellement bon dans leur vitrine qu'on a juste envie de tout commander ! J'ai été pour un capuccino et un gâteau au fromage et choco-caramel ! Je ne regrette pas ! Prochains sur ma liste : le fromage croustade aux pommes, le citron meringué et le cheese-cake framboise ! Can't wait !"}
{"text":"Clean and spacious restaurant...the food is fresh and service is friendly and fast. Their pies are delicious and high quality."}
{"text":"Food - All the pies/cakes were made to perfection  - The cakes came out fresh - Espresso....no issues.  Service - Was fast and courteous"}
{"text":"I adore the cakes and pies here so much! Delicious, generous portion sizes, and friendly staff. I do wish they had more of the popular flavors so that when you come in later in the day they would still be available."}
{"text":"Thank you Julia, for recommending me this place.  Rockaberry \"ROCKS!\" A nice cute cafe. Excellent desserts. Their sandwiches and soup are pretty good too.   I like coming here to just relax and have cafe latte with friends.  Been here 3x. Sometimes the service is good and sometimes not."}
{"text":"I like coming here for dessert. The rockashakes are my favourite shakes. Love their apple crumble the best. They do have a wide range of pies you can choose from (or hey you can order a whole one to go!) Love that there's parking. Service is ok so giving this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"My go to place for pies and coffee. Atmosphere is friendly, service is great and loving the new upgrades they've done at the place."}
{"text":"Ordered one of the daily specials - soup of the day, choice of salad (garden, oriental garden, or Caesar), choice of coffee or tea, and a slice of pie for $14.  The broccoli-cheddar soup of the day was bland - not much else to say about it. Caesar was mediocre - overdressed and devoid of Parmesan, but at least the croutons were crunchy and well seasoned. But really, who comes for the food?  The pie on the other hand was pretty good. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I am easily influenced by large servings - and the slices are huge. The apple crumble pie in particular is piled high high high with thinly sliced, cinnamon-spiced apples and a buttery sweet crumble topping. I love that the apples retain their structure, rather than melt down to nothingness. The flavour is a bit heavy on the cinnamon and would benefit from some acidity, but overall it's quite nice. In terms of the crust, the bottom was a bit soggy, but the sides retained a nice crisp crunch. The vanilla ice cream was nondescript.   Service was average. Friendly servers, but once they took our orders and brought the food, they pretty much disappeared. Nobody refilled our water glasses for at least an hour and a half...  Next time I would probably just order a pie to go... It's more economical and I have no inclination to return for another meal."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  Staff is more concerned with their cell phones or talking to each other than serving customers.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great cakes, don't get me wrong... But the service at this specific location? Ugh!   Slowest service of all time, no smile of course because that would be too much to ask, you have to wait forever to be seated, to get water, for them to take your order, for the food to arrive and even to pay!   Basically, go buy the cake, eat it at home."}
{"text":"I love Rockaberry's pies... They're consistently delicious, and there's always a huge variety.   Most people love the Oreo cheesecake and other chocolatey pies, but I'm not a big fan of chocolate (yeah I'm weird, I know)... My absolute favourite pie that I can't get enough of is the strawberry rhubarb crumb, warmed up. I often go in and pick up a slice to-go :)   The \"regular meals\" are also really good, and the prices can't be beat. The Soup / Sandwich / Pie combo is great.   The restaurant itself is nicely renovated from their recent move into the old Pizza Hut local and it's cozy and comfortable. Never too loud or crowded like the one on St Charles (Kirkland). I drive out of my way to this one even though I'm closer to the other 2 (Kirkland/Vaudreuil).   Oh, and if you're ever invited to a dinner, be a good host and pick up a pie at Rockaberry's to bring for dessert, would you? ;)"}
{"text":"A+ on all the chocolate flavoured pie !  Apple crumble was also amazing !!  Would come back after dinner !"}
{"text":"We went to this Rockaberry for my birthday brunch at today's lunch hour! We were looking for the Griffintown Café but it sadly close recently and which was in my top-3 best brunch in Montréal and it was at that particular location but we were starving so went at that Rockaberry anyways. My girlfriend and I we are French-Canadians, even if we both speak fluently in English we were acknowledged in the Shakespeare's tongue. It's usually no big deal but the guy asked us if we were going great and than ran away from the table immediately while we were answering back (which shows that he couldn't care less). We were answering back in French to show him that was the language we want to be serve with (there is no French/English war here, just a polite way to serve your costumers in a city where most than half of the population speaks, even if we know that Griffintown it's mostly an Anglo speaking neighbourhood). So he came to our table a second time and seems to show that he doesn't understand French by asking us questions in English a second time. We were obviously ready to order 'cause both our menus were closed on the edge of the table but he was busy serving the only other couple in the restaurant so we wait there for awhile with annoying top-40 hits blasting out the speakers. He decided to serve us in French for the third time at our table and we notice that he speaks better in French than both of us in English. He ask finally for our orders and in the middle of my girlfriend ordering process he ran away from the table a second time to grab a pen and a note pad at the cash register than we both looked at each others with the \"what the fuck?\" face. He came back and my girlfriend had to repeat her order for a second time because he couldn't hear the rest of it while running away. We used to go at the Rockaberry on Saint-Denis quite often and we know their products. We both ordered a Vienna coffee which we are used to have with a swirl of melted dark chocolate on the top of the whipped cream which wasn't there but we had instead cinnamon seasoning on top which my girlfriend is not a fan of. The name Rockaberry is obviously from the musical genre: rockabilly because the logo used to be the logo from the rockabilly revival band Stray Cats. The music there being crappy top-40 hits in a hipster neighbourhood as Griffintown doesn't make sense at all. I've gave 2 stars for bagels and pies being awesome as usual but it lost 3 stars for the awful service we had on a very quiet lunch hour!"}
{"text":"If you love desserts then Rockaberry is THE place to go when you visit Montreal.   They offer a variety of cakes and pies that will make your mouth water simply at the sight of them. Of course, desserts are kind of their thing, but they also offer a menu of soups, salads, etc. for those who aren't interested in indulging their sweet tooth.  After glancing at the cakes and pies they had on display I knew right away what I was going to order. I ordered the raspberry and peach crumble pie. OMG! I can't even think about how good that pie was from the filling to the crust without wanting to take an impromptu trip back to Montreal. I accompanied my slice of pie with a tea and the entire meal itself was very affordable.  Just a few things to note:  - staff does speak English (for you non-French speakers) - there are two floors available for seating  - Free wi-fi is available at that location  I would love to stop at Rockaberry when I go back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Rockaberry is a chain of pie restaurants in Montreal that are improbably also a bit of a late-night hotspot. They have a range of about twenty-five sweet pies, which they serve with soft drinks, milkshakes, coffee or alcohol. The pies range from classics like pecan pie and apple pie to more interesting inventions like millefeuille and oreo cheese. It has a very relaxed feel and is reasonably priced. I thought the pies were pretty good, though apparently they divide local opinion. The best thing about the St Denis branch is that it has a terrace on the lively street for the obvious people-watching and chilling out in the summer.    I think they also serve restaurant courses, but I've only ever gone in for pie and beer/milkshake."}
{"text":"Rockaberry is definitely worth a try. I know they have a few locations so obviously they're doing well. I haven't been to any of their other locations but based on experience this place was pretty nice and laid back. It wasn't too busy when I went, probably due to weather, there were only a few people sitting down to eat and a few others studying.   I came only to try their pies. First off, how do they fit all that filling under the crust??? They're certainly not normal pies, they're mountain pies!  We got a few slices to bring home for my family. We got blueberry, cherry, strawberry/peach, boston creme, and another custardy sweet one. I have to say the fruit pie slices were much better than the sweet custard ones, my favourite being cherry.   I was disappointed in the service though. It took quite a long time to get 5 slices of pie cut and packaged...  Of course I like my mom's homemade pies more, but if you're looking for a delicious alternative I would recommend Rockaberry."}
{"text":"Toujours bon à chaque visite, serveur attentionné et grosses portions. Un peu cher par contre"}
{"text":"If you are a cheesecake pie lover, this is your place! The lunch food is very average and overpriced, but you NEED to try the cheesecake. I had the carrot cheesecake pie and my mouth was melting. Definitely a good way to die of a sugar overdose! It can seem expensive but it's a good price for a great cheesecake. The only problem with the cheesecake pies is that you're gonna get fat and poor from the amount of cheesecake you'll want to eat there. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Decent place to go to, many varieties of desserts, food wise options are okay, very, very nice staff!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place but unfortunately had to take it to go because there wasn't enough room to be able to sit, I'm assuming weekend nights are relatively busy and you won't have somewhere to sit.  Another thing to point out is that they charge a bag on your bill without letting you know it's 1$ plus taxes.   The selection was also very week on there part, only about 7 pies to pick from."}
{"text":"Rockaberry's is best known for their pies, pies, pies! A heavenly, yet devilish, treat that makes you feel oh-so-divine. I always walk on over from the Concordia quarter and back, as to not feel guilty for indulging. They serve some sandwiches, salads, and other things here and there too... but their pies are phenomenal and hit the spot just right.  My favourites are their fudge & caramel cheesecake, oreo cheesecake, raspberry crumble pie, and strawberry & peach crumble pie. Mmmmm... Writing this is making me want some right now.  They have outdoor seating that provides a great view of what's happening on St. Denis, from shopping to watching passers-by."}
{"text":"ROCKABERRY CHEESE PIE! Man, this pie is so rich and so decadent. I love it. It is the creamiest cream cheese cheesecake.  When you want something to wake your taste buds, this is the pie. If you are looking for a traditional kind of pie, please try the peach pie and the apple crumble. They are dericious!!!! LOL Try it out with no regrets! Hum, now I want pie!"}
{"text":"Good place for a first date if you're getting coffee. Their meals are not great, I had a pizza. It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't go back for dinner. Their pies are the best"}
{"text":"Oh... my... G*D! This place is AMAZING!   I've been on a pie kick since Thanksgiving. Seriously. For the past four or so months my friends have heard nothing but my desire for pie! Last weekend while on a trip to Montreal with my girlfriends, I started talking about my never ending desire for pie again. And so, after a fabulous dinner at L'Express, I was taken here, to Rockberry, otherwise known as pie heaven!   So the group of us were absolutely stuffed to the gills when we arrived, but we still decided to get coffee and share 3 pieces of pie. And I voted to get mine a'la mode (yuuuuuuuuuum!).   And when they arrived.... they were GIANT!! Each \"slice\" was seriously a QUARTER of an ENTIRE PIE. And the a'la mode was two GIANT scoops of ice cream. INSANE.   And... SO GOOD! The apple pie was the best out of the three. The strawberry rhubarb was too sweet for my taste. And the blueberry pie was perfect... and swimming in ice cream. YUM! My lactose intolerant stomach didn't complain (thank goodness), and I was able to gleefully stuff myself sick with pie and ice cream.   It's such a good thing Montreal is a 6 hour drive away... or I'd be here every weekend! :) The BEST place for pie! And our server was really sweet. And it looks to be a great place for a date! We saw a bunch of people eating sandwiches and dinner here. But definitely... come here for the pie!"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by a good friend of mine in the USA.  The Canadians say this is like the USA version of the Cheesecake Factory.  I have to admit, I was a little disappointed.  The way the locals here talk about the apple crumble cheesecake made it sound so delicious that I was super excited to be here.  So excited in fact that I walked 4 blocks on St. Denis street just to get here in the snow.  I ordered the apple crumble cheesecake, the mocha tiramisu, and the bananalicious.  Here's the thing, all three were decent, and yes I ordered all 3 slices just for myself, but it wasn't spectacular.  That's why I kept ordering more since I really wanted to believe the hype.  Decent but definitely not mind blowing."}
{"text":"Great pie but slow service on a Saturday night. I think they forgot about us, when we first got here. They sat us and then never returned to ask if we were ready to order.. We had to flag down the waitress to get her attention so that we could finally order. Great food and atmosphere but the waitresses are very much lacking in rapidness and efficiency."}
{"text":"Rockaberry was alright, nothing special. Ordered the club sandwich, which was light on lettuce but heavy on the mayo -- not the greatest. The white bread it was served on (there were no other choices) made the sandwich particularly underwhelming. The slice of strawberry rhubarb pie that was ordered to-go was also underwhelming -- pretty tart.  On the upside, they have draft beer and friendly service -- that counts for something, right? I still wish I would've ordered a slice of the millefeuille that I asked the waitress about (my non-Francophone self had never heard of such a creation let alone knew what the word translated to) -- she was very patient in explaining in English what millefeuille was. Oh well, maybe some other time. We shall see."}
{"text":"Although their desserts are scrumptious, can't give this place more than 2 stars due to poor service. I met some friends here on a Saturday evening. Although the restaurant was busy, it wasn't overflowing with several empty tables. The waitress passed by once to take our order, and another time to bring us our order and that was it. She never checked in to see if we needed anything else, no water refill, nothing."}
{"text":"Location: In the heart of Monkland village. Metered parking or look for parking on the side streets.   The place: Average decor and average size. The lighting's a little dim but I'm not here for the ambiance. They have limited seating inside and outside on their terrace.   The food: I'm only reviewing their dessert, as I haven't had a meal here. I ordered the chocolate and raspberry cheesecake and it was really good. I expected it to be overly sweet but this wasn't the case at all. The cake was fresh, not too cheesy and the texture was perfect - kind of like a firm cloud of fromage. Yum! My date ordered the Oreo cheesecake and loved it. They do seem to have a pretty good rotation because the place was packed and I saw them putting fresh cakes in their display.  Service: Our waitress was friendly and offered up some suggestions. She also came to check on us while we were there. The only annoyance was that we were never brought our bill, and the line to pay at the cash is one hot mess. There is no line - just a group of people crowding around and cutting in front of each other. They really need to work out some kind of order because this isn't very efficient.   Price: Average. It cost me about $12 for cake and tea."}
{"text":"I love their cheesecakes. The Toblerone cheesecake is amazing! I also really enjoy their veggie grilled cheese in a wrap. It has avocado and when they grill it, it tastes amazing. Great with potato wedges and a salad on the side. Service is good too and they have free wifi."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Rockaberry for dessert during our trip to Montreal. It was not very busy on a Sunday night. Ordered coffee and split a berry pie a la mode, since they were out if the blueberry pie. Perhaps we didn't order the right thing, as they had done other rich looking chocolate and cheesecake pies, but I thought the pie was average. It was warm but didn't blow me away, and the berries seemed to have more of a preserve than fresh.   The ambience inside wasn't the most cozy, although had ample seating and a great location close to Plateau Mt. Royal."}
{"text":"Montreal classic with lots of wonderful pies some of them are pretty heavy to say the least ! My favourite is the the key lime pie ;)"}
{"text":"I feel like Rockaberry is the go-to (the only?????) hangout spot in the West Island if you're looking to grab a good desert. Their pies are 10/10. I always say I'm gonna try something different but always end up ordering blueberry pie with a scoop of ice cream.   I've also tried some of their sandwiches and a few of their hot chocolates (did you know they have banana hot chocolate????) And they were alright. Honestly, I only come here for the pies."}
{"text":"One guy goes into the shop.  Me: Hello.  Pie Dude: Hello.   Me: A slice of cheese cake, strawberry please.  Pie Dude: Sure. Wait , did you say strawberry shortcake or cheesecake?  Me: Cheesecake please.  While he puts the slice into a styrofoam container, I paused and think to myself: \"I really should stop lying about my height. C'mon man, you know you're only 5 foot...\"  Pie Dude: Here you go.You need a fork?  Me: No thanks.  The guy then leave the shop with a smile."}
{"text":"I always knew that this restaurant has the most deliciously decadent desserts but had never actually ate here. After coming here 3 times, I decided to eat a full lunch here and it was also delicious! I had a Philly Cheese Steak with a side of potato fried wedges. It was all very good. Their desserts are all amazingly deliciously decadent. I tried 5 different pies and they all gave me a heart attack...that's a good thing. I've noticed that the place is often packed with women of all ages... While the men are busy watching hockey, the women are enjoying themselves here eating sweets. The restaurant has a TV screen where the (hockey) game was on but no one was watching.  There's a huge terrace in the front which is usually packed on our (rare) hot summer nights. Great place. Our waitress was so nice."}
{"text":"Voici le temple des petites douceurs. Oui, oui, vous pourrez aussi prendre un sandwich ou un wrap si le cur vous en dit, mais franchement vous n'êtes pas là pour ça. Vous le savez, je le sais, alors n'essayons pas de prétendre le contraire. Vous êtes là pour les gâteaux!  Je vous recommanderai donc la croustade aux pommes ou encore mieux, celle aux framboises et pêches! Et vous pouvez même demander à ce qu'elle vous soit servie réchauffée, avec une boule de glace et un verre de lait! Ah et tant que vous y êtes, testez aussi la tarte aux citrons meringuée! Vous m'en direz des nouvelles!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm not going to make any friends by saying this, but BLECH! The blueberry crumble was basically shortening-flour goo on top of sugary jam goo. The coffee and service both lukewarm. The ambiance severely lacking.  I would give three stars for a freezing blizzardy night when you find yourself walking home with a good friend, and you stop in while the place is busy and full of life and you sit upstairs and look out at the snow falling in the streetlights and warm up with an irish coffee. That's the three star experience. But keep in mind, none of that has anything at all to do with pie.  The two star experience is the one I had today. And I gotta say, it's really not that hard to make delicious fresh pie. I make them all the dang time. And it is as simple as butter, flour, fruit, sugar. So if you're serving pie that is anything less than delicious, it means that it's probably full of a bunch of junk that is supposed to preserve it from going bad. Which means that you're not actually making fresh pie. And if you're not making fresh pie, what am I doing here?  Anyway, this place seems to have a bit of cachet here, and yes, if you find yourself on a second date, after dinner on Saint-Denis, and you don't really want to grab drink but you'd like to keep chatting, and you wanna test whether this person is the type who will hog the dessert, then sure, stop in and split a cheesecake.  But not worth crossing town for..."}
{"text":"i dislike overpriced, basic foods & Rockaberry is exactly that. Pies are okay, the only one i recommend is the apple cheese crumb. The pies are usually too heavy and impossible to finish a whole slice and the crumbs are lacking some sort of ice cream and lightness, thus the apple cheese crumb has come to the rescue. everything else on the menu, mehhh."}
{"text":"I love pie. So when my friend recommended a great pie place in Montreal, I immediately added it to the itinerary. Hubby and I walked over after lunch at Schwartz's and shared the waiter's rec of a slice of apple crumble cheese. SO GOOD. The \"crumble\" is made up of these huge chunks of buttery, sugary, crumble-y deliciousness; the apples were not overly sweet or gummy; and the cheesecake was fluffy and smooth. Minus one star for the sloooow service due to the fact they only had 2 people on staff at the time. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Awesome pie here.  Was very pleased with the key lime and apple crumb pie.  Definitely on my list of places to return on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here last night and picked up some cake. Got the caramel fudge and the strawberry cheesecake. This place has been around for years and it never dissapoints."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Montreal! If you are a dessert person, this is a \"must\" place. They have a wide range of pie selections and its all amazing! My personal favourite is the apple crumb with vanilla ice cream.  Their wraps and salads are not bad either."}
{"text":"Decent service, delicious pies with so many amazing choices that the hardest decision you'll have to make is which flavour combination to try! Yummy. One of my faves is the \"Apple cheese crumb\".  It's almost $8 +taxes for the slice so a little overpriced but it's so decadent and a very large portion. Does not disappoint when you're craving dessert."}
{"text":"Went for dinner/dessert after work this week with some girlfriends. First time at this location.   I ordered the spicy tuna salad because i wanted something lighter and healthier before I devoured some pie. I was expecting a few pieces of seared tuna for a $15.50 salad. Instead, it was flaked tuna salad... it should've been more clear. Anyway I was starving so I ate the whole thing. It's paired well with the balsamic dressing.  On to dessert. I ordered a decaf mocha (looked better than it tasted). As for pies, they ran out of not 1 but 2 of my pie choices (apple cheese crumb and apple crumble). Ridiculous!! By the time I ordered my pie, I picked the carrot cheese randomly off their menu and it was just ok. I ended up taking it to go for my sister... was a pretty blah meal for $35.   The service was decent and this location is huge with lots of parking."}
{"text":"My favorite pie and cake shop in Montreal... I visit every time I'm in town. :( Unfortunately I'll have to find a substitute now... I'm really a bit sad that i'll never taste their brownie chocolate cheesecake with caramel and brownie toppings again. The servers were also very nice and always willing to joke with me for 2 mins while they pack up my take out cake."}
{"text":"AMAZING PIE!!  I am obsessed with blueberry cobblers/crumbles....and this was probably one of the best I've ever had.   I also tried the raspberry crumble, a chocolate something and tiramasu. All were pretty good!  Service was great. Most of the service I experienced around Montreal was pretty bad (Especially when they realized we were Americans) but the girl who worked there was SOOO NICE! And super helpful. And actually spoke to us in English.   Love this place and will definitely come back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai jamais compris la tendance \"tarte\". Si j'ai le choix entre un brownie, un biscuit ou une portion de tarte, mon ventre crie pour les deux premiers. C'est pourquoi le Rockaberry m'intriguait, je voulais voir si je pouvais tripper sur les tartes moi aussi.   Ça commence avec un service vraiment détaché. Les tartes sont disposées en arrière d'une vitre au comptoir, mais on nous indique qu'on ne peut pas rester là et qu'il faut attendre pour le serveur à notre table. Personnellement je mange avec mes yeux en premier, et voir les tartes pour faire mon choix était bien plus invitant que de lire un monotone menu.  Niveau nourriture, on ne fait rien à moitié. Ta pointe va te coûter 6$, mais tu vas avoir le tier d'une tarte dans ton assiette. Qui a vraiment faim pour tout ça? J'aurais vraiment aimé avoir l'option d'une \"demi-portion\"; Oui les tartes étaient bonne, mais trop c'est comme pas assez. Oui tu peux partager ta pointe à deux, mais faut s'entendre sur le choix d'une tarte en commun, et avec l'appétissante variété proposée c'est un gros défi quand même.  Mais au final non, j'ai pas eu de révélation. Je vais rester avec mes biscuits."}
{"text":"Best deserts in town! I preferred the old location as it was more like \"home\" and cozy but the new one is obviously revamped and more profitable. I love the quality of all their products! Looking forward to bring pies back to Toronto for some friends!   Only down fall is the size of the patio and the smoking section. The entire patio is more or so a smoking pit."}
{"text":"Great spot to catch a dessert, they have a whole page in the menu from multiple cheesecakes to pies and also an extended  beverage menu with alcohol or not. I didn't try a meal but the place was packed, which also means it was LOUD! We were placed at a small table next to the bar and had to wait a long time for service. Too many waiters passed us by until we asked for menus 15 minutes later. Once we ordered, the service was nice. This place always had movement as soon as a table is cleared, new customers are seated. I tried the strawberry shortcake and it was delicious, fresh whipped cream, light moist vanilla cake and a straberries. My daughter had a cheesecake where the base was apple pie, the middle layer was cheesecake and it was topped with apple crumble. Too big to eat, she brought half home, many had their little box bringing home their leftovers."}
{"text":"mmmmm pie! it was nice to go with a group and get a few slices to split between all of us. Some were more creamy/chocolate lovers while others liked the fruity stuff, but the general sentiment seemed to be wonderful satisfaction.  There were several levels of seating and since we went earlier in the day it was pretty quiet. I think I saw some people by themselves studying/reading."}
{"text":"I have never sat down and enjoyed a piece of pie at this Rockaberry location - it is usually just a 'grab & go' last-minute Potluck / Dinner Party dessert.  So far I have tried the 'Rockabrownie' and 'Raspberry Fudge Cheescake' which were both absolutely delicious. The Rockabrownie is a tad too creamy and not as many flavours or textures as the Raspberry Fudge so I probably would not order that one again. It was great nonetheless but would have preferred more bite and brownie, less mousse/cream. The Raspberry Fudge however is PERFECT. Every layer is heavenly - has to be my favourite out of the cakes!"}
{"text":"I had heard many good reviews from friends about this place so finally made it to the West Island to give it a go!  I immediately loved the interior, very warm and cosy with lots of space. For a Tuesday evening, it was definitely buzzing with most tables full.  The menu has a huge selection of starters, snacks, salads and sides to desserts, pies and crumbles... it definitely needs a good looking through to decide what to get! I ordered the nachos, apple crumble pie with a mocha latte which I was very impressed with. The nachos were extremely good, accompanied with salsa and sour cream... the cheese could have been less stuck as a whole and more evenly spread out but if you are willing to get your hands messy, it does the job! The apple crumble was a huge portion, definitely enough for two people! The latte was delicious but was not hot enough so I requested for it to be warmed up. I found the waitress quite rude and service not so great as we kept having to request and call her over. However, aside from that I loved what I ordered and had an overall good experience so hopefully will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I felt like the chicken was heated in the microwave awful experience please respect your stomach and never go there. I had stomach pain after eating there!"}
{"text":"This place is filled with diabetic coma inducing pies!  Name it and they have it  I usually have the apple crumble or cheesecake pie I like it but I find their pies are really sweet maybe too sweet Sometimes I enjoy their salad too, I don't know if it's more because it makes me feel better about myself or because they are fresh and tasty.  Always busy ! Sometimes u can expect a short lineup  It's a bit overpriced but the portion are so big that it makes up for it.  Service is always good in my experience"}
{"text":"I've been going to Rockaberry for the last 20 years and while it may have lost some of its original luster and mystique it's a solid place to go with friends or loved ones to enjoy coffee/dessert before or after your main evening plans.. Their menu is more than that of course, you can have lunch or supper as well but with all due respect.... when I see that type of selection of pies... you should fully expect what's going to happen!  At this point, I've had countless slices of pies and my favorite ones are the strawberry cheesecake, key lime pie and strawberry rhubarb crumble. The other pies are perfectly fine, don't let the critics tell you otherwise... but those 3 are my top 3. What can I say, I'm an equal pie eating opportunist.  Service speed is slow, sometimes bordering on the impossibly slow side but I don't think it's a question of the staffing not being competent.... it's more of a question of not enough bodies available on busy nights and that's something clearly for management to address.  These days, a lot of people are comparing the Rockaberry staple to new gen dessert places such as Juliet & Chocolat or Chocolats Favoris. I cannot comment on Chocolate Favoris since I'm not one to wait outside over an hour for dessert but I've been to Juliet & Chocolat several times now and THAT'S quite overrated and to me... clearly not worth waiting 30+ minutes outside to enjoy. Some may claim Rockaberry is expensive... yeahhhhh.... you probably never been at the competition.  I would however definitely agree on some extras, such as making some of the pies \"a la mode\" if the patrons requests it or anything else they can creatively do. The menu needs a little more oomph these days.  This particular establishment is huge, with lots of seating room. Wait time on my last visit was less than 5 minutes on a Saturday night at 9 PM. Very nice! Service was fast and friendly too but our waiter was running around like crazy to make it happen. Place looked clean and the key lime pie and latte I had was just right. A great night was had!!!  Please note you can also come in and buy a pie, great idea if you need a last minute selection prior to going to a party or gathering. Prices are reasonable (more than actual bakeries...). Just be mindful they do run out of pies, so make sure to come by earlier in the day if possible."}
{"text":"Contrary to many, we came here for Brunch! Place was mostly empty with curt and polite hostesses who took care of us.   I went with the Rockabagel and hot chocolate (with whipped cream of course...). The hot chocolate was delicious without being too sweet. Perhaps I was famished but I really enjoyed my Rockabagel! It was chewy and tender and packed with tasty calories. My only disappointment with the Rockabagel plate coming with no accessories. It was a yummy but nonetheless a pretty expensive bagel experience. Why not add a few potato wedges or a large fruit salad?  Overall, a nice experience."}
{"text":"The service was slightly slow even though there weren't many customers. Oreo cheesecake I do not recommend unless you like the taste of cream cheese, also the Oreo crust was soft and thin. The strawberry shortcake was nice and light. The rockabrownie had a lot of mousse/cream and the brownie itself was quite dense. We also ordered a plate of potato wedges & sweet potato fries. The potato wedges were amazing however the sweet potatoes had a weird after taste. Overall was good just would order different items. The price for the cakes were about 7.50"}
{"text":"As a first time diner there we were less than impressed by the fact that our appetizer of Nachos was served to us burnt.  Obviously neither the person who cooked it or the lady who served it cared too much about the quality of the food they serve."}
{"text":"Cheese cakes are amazing, great place before or after a movie for coffee & dessert.  However service tends to be very slow! My favourite cheese cake is the strawberry cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this dessert place 5/5 because: 1) decor is great 2) owner Dominique reached out to us personally to offer coffee and ask if all is good and if were enjoying. Big plus. 3) owner is hands on and helping employees on a Sat. Night 4) cakes are always good here. Try the cheesecake apple pie. Definitely recommending if you're close."}
{"text":"Huuuuge cakes to share with friends! Try the apple crumble cheesecake! You won't regret it! :D mmmmm"}
{"text":"Typical Montreal flare, inside is very well done and trendy. Not like in the states where places try to be trendy but fail miserably. The deserts were great as well as the drinks. Service was as expected, the only thing I didn't care for was how loud it was inside. It's one of my biggest pet peeves, but I can't fault the business for that they did everything as they should have. As for all the loud people, shhhh trying to enjoy my delish dessert"}
{"text":"I love every cakes in this restaurant!! Deserts were perfect, But i didn't  like poutine and quesadilla. Not that good... Just go for cakes and pies :)"}
{"text":"L'intérieur ressemble comme un rockaberry classique, les gateaux sont bons mais parfois inégaux. J'avais pris un gateau au fromage et on sentait à peine le fromage comparé à celui de la personne qui m'accompagnait. Au final je trouve que l'addition est assez élevée pour ce que c'est, 20$ (tout inclus) pour 2 parts de gateau. Cela a calmé mon envie d'y retourner ..."}
{"text":"Ma première visite au Rockaberry et à mon grand désarroi, j'avais vraiment pas faim. My gosh que les desserts avaient l'air bons!  En attendant notre rendez-vous au A/Maze qui est la porte voisine du Rockaberry, nous avons décidé de prendre une boisson glacée sur la terrasse et de profiter un peu du beau soleil du week-end.  Comme le permis d'alcool nous restreint à être obligé de prendre à manger pour boire sur la terrasse, une copine à commandé un bol de quartiers de patates frites. On y a quand même toutes goûté.. tsé! Elles étaient délicieuses, généreusement assaisonnées et très fraîches.  Pour boire, il y a eu un milkshake au chocolat, un rum & coke et un Moka glacé. Tous très généreux et savoureux! Coup de cur pour le Milkshake!  Les prix sont très raisonnables et le service est vraiment excellent. La jeune fille étaient clairement anglophone, mais a fait le service complet, en français. Merci ma chère!  Desserts... je reviendrai pour vous... mmmmm!"}
{"text":"We went to Rockaberry's for dessert after shopping at a close by store on the same street. I was visiting Montreal from Vancouver and hadn't been to a Rockaberry since I was a kid 20 years ago (at the Queen Mary location).  It brought back good memories...  We ordered a Rockabrownie and a Key Lime pie slice with coffee. Both pies were very good - the Rockabrownie is a chocoholic's dream and the Key Lime pie reminds is absolutely delicious.   The service was great, but to be fair, we were there during off-hours so we were the one ones in the restaurant. The server was pleasant and friendly (although after her clearly recent smoke break she should have walked around for 10 minutes to lose the smell).   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the desert over there... Everything is good especially their salad ;) love love love. Must try"}
{"text":"J'y vais depuis son ouverture. Les repas sont moyens et trop cher pour ce que c'est, alors pourquoi j'y retourne LA CROUSTADE AUX POMMES. La mienne est bonne, mais la leur est meilleure. Je n'y vais que rarement pour manger sur place. J'y vais pour prendre la croustade pour apporter. Beaucoup moins cher malgré la HAUSSE des prix que si je prends un morceau sur place. De plus, de cette façon j'évite le mauvais service. Je donnerais une bien meilleure note si je notais seulement la croustade au pommes et je donnerais seulement deux étoiles si je notais le restant du menu. Si vous y allez pour prendre un bon repas, c'est à éviter. Si vous voulez une bonne croustade (autre choix qu'aux pommes) accompagnée d'une boule de crème glacée allez-y sans faute."}
{"text":"Hey !! If you like yummy cakes and pies do not overlook Rockaberry.  I personally love the Apple crisp pie. Good salads and sandwiches too."}
{"text":"I have always really liked the atmosphere and the desserts, it's a fun hang out spot.   I recently had to remove dairy from my diet.    I wish that milk alternatives were available (soy, coffee mate) because right now If you can't drink milk of cream then you better like your coffee black. There was a coconut milk latte but it was terrible.   Starbucks, cafe depot and second cup all offer soy alternatives, it would be more than awesome if Rockaberry could too."}
{"text":"It's a few times I go in and the girl at the cash is extremely rude and aggressive for no reason. Unfortunately it was a Saturday always busy there was a few empty 2 seat tables didn't offer to accommodate although we were 3 and willing to sit tight together not realizing the terrace was open she didn't offer us to sit out on the terrace instead gave us attitude let others pass in front of us until we were upset enough to leave. Another time was extremely rude when I went to pay. It's unfortunate as it's a cute place to bring my clients for coffee but to risky when you have someone who greets you at the door or takes your payment with a triggered attitude."}
{"text":"Not my type of cakes that they have there but the cheese cake is ok prices are expensive and it's not worth it for the quality try to cross street for Premiere Moisson which is way better!!"}
{"text":"It's small,seats maybe 30 people. You definitely don't come here for the service,they take their sweet time to get your order or even bring you water.    I come here for the toblerone cheesecake,it's good. It's big enough to break down into 2 portions. It's not as though they don't have a load of choices but I'm a creature of habit. The pies don't tickle my fancy. It's open late so that's a perk."}
{"text":"We ran across this great little bakery during our stroll through Montreal. There was a group of four of us, which gave us the chance to order several different items and share. Everything was GREAT, especially the apple pie! If you're near by, save room for this place's great desserts!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh comment ne pas parler du rockabery leur gâteau et tarte sublime vous voulez un dessert réussi pour n importe quelle occasion vous ne pouvez pas manquer votre coût acheté en morceau ou complet vous avez le choix la ,portion est superbe prenez un bon café avec ça je vous direz pas prend lui ou lui non essayé les tous je n ais pas essayé les Lunches je vous en reparlerez plus tard mais pour les gâteaux go all the way yesssssss"}
{"text":"The truffle pie was consistent (I know that's a strange word to use in this context, but I mean that the truffle was uniformly tasty), and the delicious \"Rockafrappe\" milkshake reminded me of an old-style dinner.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I've definitely had better, and yes, I've been here more than once! The service is ok, the pies are overrated, and the coffee, well let's just say you can find the same thing basically anywhere. In other words NOTHING SPECIAL/NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT! Also, the cashier that was there tonight....let's just say, she must be related to the owner, cause with her attitude, there's no benefit to keeping such an individual on staff. In a nutshell don't bother going here, there are better places with better service that comes with a smile to spend your money on and this isn't one of them!"}
{"text":"Great place, cozy atmosphere & nice terrasse! The famous pies are famous for a reason. So far, we've tried caramel fudge, raspberry fudge, blueberry & apple crumble cheese and tiramisu - the first 3 are definitely recommended! Also great cappuccino & coffee."}
{"text":"I think they deserve a 5 for their pies.  I read the comments.. and I never had a problem with service here (and I've been a customer x over 10 years )  It's OK-priced pie !!! (6-8$) You'd probably pay as much or even more for a smaller portion in a restaurant for your desert.  Amazing tasting pies !!! There is a lot of variety that is cream-cheese flavoured pie, just check before if you're not a fan.  I cannot finish one portion to myself I usually share it with someone, but when I am here I see a lot of people eat one full portion to themselves.  Service is always quick when I come.  I love ...  - their coffee with whipped cream : Viennois coffee. - the ice cream on top of a heated pie !! - their potato wedges.  - coming here in the afternoon when it's not too crowded and music is not too loud (music goes louder at night and light dims down too) - that they have a really good variety of pies, and you can order them for take-out too. - their terrace in the summer  The sandwiches are OK, you should really come for the pie.   Psst there is no wi-fi."}
{"text":"so good for the cheesecake cravings. they also serve savoury dishes if ever you wanna check it out for a snack of lunch."}
{"text":"Rockaberry is the must-go place for cake lovers. Their giant, rich and delicious pies are a guilty pleasure and unlike anything else. I have to admit that every year for my birthday I treat myself with a cake from Rockaberry; that's just how great it is!  Where they lose a star however is in the rest of their menu. Their food items are not bad but they do not impress at all. They are quite bland and unoriginal. The prices are too high for the quality they offer in that department. Their expertise truly is pies/cakes. I would therefore recommend eating dinner or lunch elsewhere first, then going to Rockaberry for dessert. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Today I tried the left over Toblerone Cheese pie cake my folks got for my mom's bday yesterday. That was a flat zero for me, and I took the average of my ratings, since the other times their cakes have been usually a decent 4 star, with only their Boston Cream Pie cake being my top fave, at a solid 5 star rating for me.  This Toblerone Cheese was awful to me. The cake on the bottom was actually very nice, but the flavor and aftertaste of the thick icing ontop ruined it so much for me, that I gave my piece away, and I'm usually very forgiving.  It had a very odd flavor to it, which was unedible to me. Almost sour or bitter. I'm not sure if it just doesn't keep in the freezer. It was only inside overnight, and I had let it sit on the counter for 15 min before it became soft enough to eat. Perhaps it is only meant to be eaten right away? Or perhaps it was not freshly made when they bought it. However, it was 35$, which is their most expensive cake, as well as new to their menu suposably. Very disapointing.  We've preserved many of their other pie cakes this same way, and they never went bad like this, which is why I'm hesitant to believe that it was our storage method that changed the flavor, and feel that it was actually originally made this way.  Their oreo pie cake has been safely decent in the past. But none of all the cakes I've tried here over the years have been equal or surpased their Boston Cream. It wasn't overly sweet or dry. Very well balanced, and quite addictive for me. However, the only time I eat these pies is when I'm sharring it with a group, and everytime we look to choose a cake, I have always found it impossible to convince anyone to agree as a group to select the Boston Cream.  These are people who have never tried it before, and just by looking at the pie, they never find it tempting. I believe that it's because it lacks having an appealing decor, sadly. It's very plain compared to the others. Of course, that's what a bostom cream theme is supose to look like, but I'd like for Rockaberry's to add as much of a special flair to it as they do to their other decorated pies, in order to make it more appealing to the eye. Give it justice.  Their website is very unapealing. They just write a list of all their pies, no pictures of each or even a description. Lazy business. I hope they don't slack off on the food itself, and it's just their honest skills that need a boost."}
{"text":"Consistent satisfaction. Love their pies! Good coffee too. Always satisfies my cravings when I need it."}
{"text":"Rockaberry used to be a popular hangout for my group of friends a long time ago and over the years it simply became our place where we'd go in grab a whole pie and take it out with us to group events. Recently we opted to have dessert here and here's the rundown of my experience.  Pros :  - What gorgeous decor! We sat near the fireplace and basked in its heat during our meal. The experience was very nice! - Caramel latte was very good, my cheesecake was also good but I've had better.  Cons :  - The service really left a lot to be desired. It was slow and not really attentive but the cherry on top was when we got our bills.... there was simply no effort to get them right! All our orders (4 of them) were completed messed up and we were advised to \"fix it at the cash\". Excuse me? What a waste of time and I'm sure the 10 people or so who were waiting to pay to leave behind us were wondering what was going on with everyone fixing their bills.  Would have been a 4.5 star experience but I'm docking 1 star for that last point. Price-tag is about average, about $14 for a slice of pie and a latte (a whole pie is $20...)."}
{"text":"After dinner at Saint Sacrament, we HAD to get dessert so we came to Rockaberry for the first time in years!   We ordered the apple crumble cheesecake and the pecan pie. The pecan pie definitely hit the spot as a dessert but the vanilla ice cream along with it was very average.   I gave Rockaberry three stars because everything from the service, the decor and the all-around 'meh' vibes of the place are generic and mediocre at best... All things you would expect from a chain cafe. Still worth it to satisfy your sweet tooth in the St. Denis / Mont Royal area!"}
{"text":"Before This week, I had never been to Rockaberry. Now I've been three times. I knew they served cake, but what I just experienced was sooooo much more! Being the first patio day in Montreal we ordered up some sangria which surprisingly good (alcoholic). I ordered the Louisiana sandwich which came with amazing wedge fries and then the Boston Cream cake for dessert. Honestly, best Thursday afternoon I've had in a while. Thanks Rockaberry!"}
{"text":"I have some mixed reviews on this This Rocaberry. On the plus side it is in a great location with nice outdoor seating outside for the summer and the staff is always friendly and efficient But I do find that this Rocaberry location is not up to par with some of the others I have been to. They have limited indoor seating which is not horrible since you usually don't end up waiting too long for a seat. However , the main reason I feel like this location isn't my favourite is actually because of the pies themselves :( the last few times I went the pie did not seem as fresh as it should be , the flavour was off and the food was mediocre. I realize this is a chain but i have had much better quality of food and desserts at their saint Leonard branch for example. If you are going to the Monkland location i would steer clear of the pies and opt more for the cheesecakes. that's just my opinion though and I hope i just had some bad luck when I went in."}
{"text":"Get the pie. You HAVE to get the pie. Ordered a lunch special, with a sandwich, coffee and a slice of pie ($10?). Of course, since Rockaberry's is a cafe renowned for their desserts, the pie did not disappoint. Not only was it an enormously huge slice about a quarter of the entire pie, the berry pie was tart, sweet, moist and flakey. The margarita panini with a small side 'salad' was fine, but not exactly memorable. The pie, however, I still crave to this day. I will be back...for more pie. Yum."}
{"text":"What to say, just everything is amazing about Rockaberry's pies, maybe a little overpriced but is a must to fill that sweet tooth craving you'll have no regrets spending that extra bit for the high quality pies!  Sandwiches are fresh and yummy as well!   The cappuccinos are good and above all the service I always get is great! The one downfall is the noise level at times is high due to the crowd and how packed it gets not a great place sometimes for those who go for a convo and caffe/desert you may have to talk loud lol. There is a nice terrasse as well!  Big 5stars though for the quality!  Treat yourself! Remember life is short so eat dessert first!!"}
{"text":"I have been a faithful Rockaberry enthusiast for many years. It's a great date place, particularly the Monkland location I find. It's cozy, usually quiet, and open late.  Everybody talks about the pies - and yes, they are amazing - but the menu is good too! I love their Louisiana sandwich and potato wedges. Their spicy mayo is really tasty.  The only thing that's a shame is that the Monkland location is simply too small. I counted 6 tables today. You often have to wait, and the place feels crammed.  It's probably a testament to their amazing pies, but it's a small disagreement.  That being said - it'd wait in line for a piece of that sweet Millefeuille pie... 100% sugar coma guarantee."}
{"text":"Rockaberry has been around since the 90s... and probably even a little earlier as  my vague memories seem to recall odd times back in College.  Either way, it's never changed too much from it's key and most important focus, PIE.  Home of quite simply awesome cream pies, fruit pies crumble pies and so on (sense a theme here?), all of monumental height and size, it's been one of my favorites through the years for coffee, dessert and just a good place to hang out.  From it's original location on Queen Mary, to the expansion on St-Denis, the West Island location (no idea if that's still around) and now the Monkland location, the pies have always been the constant that brings in the crowds at all hours of the day and night.  There may be better places for dessert.  Definately better places for atmosphere.  But for something comforting, this is always a constant.  Oh, as for all of those other details, yada yada yada... service was relatively attentive and fast, the atmosphere and the environment was nice though nothing too fancy to write about, and prices were reasonable.  Overall, it's a place I will still visit to whenever I'm back in my old hometown.  Wish I could figure out a way to get them to open a location out here in Calgary one of these days."}
{"text":"This is quite a smaller Rockaberry than the others. As always, Rockaberry doesn't disappoint and has a great variety of pies to try! They are a bit pricier than usual, but they are oh so yummy. I would definitely recommend going with a classic crumble or the bananalicious. You get quite a big serving so you can split the pie between two people :) Service is quite quick and I never have many complaints about this place. I wouldn't recommend having the food here as it is very simple and not that great. I would come here to have desserts instead."}
{"text":"I think Rockaberry's deserves another review since it's been newly renovated. (I apologize for not snapping pics).  The pies are as delicious as they've always been. This is a great quiet place to take a  new date for a drink and pie unless you're from the DDO/Pointe Claire, in which case you're almost guaranteed to see a familiar face.  Since the renovation Rockaberry's also amped up their menu. I like that they list a bunch of sandwiches and offer them as wrap, sandwich or pannini. It adds a lot of variety to suit my mood without over-complicating the menu and overwhelming the cooks, which I hate. The meals are delicious and well portioned. Rockaberry's is still a cafe-type location so expect your sandwich & salad to cost slightly more than neghbouring fast food joints (avg $14). I do, however, see justification in the prices.  Had I written this review 2 years ago, I would be giving the place 2-3 stars but the reinvigorated menu, modernized decor and improved lighting make it so that I have nothing to nitpick.  Rockaberry's also offers takeout on whole pies w/o tax ($15-$24). Grabbing one just before you get on the highway will make you a hit at any pot luck."}
{"text":"Okay so I was promised a milkshake at a bowling alley last night and it turns out they didn't have any.... SO.... I decided that tonight I must get one!  I Google Searched for where I can get a nice milkshake in Montreal and this place came up.  Amelie and I went there and she got the pecan pie (the apple pie looked amazing too!) and I got a Cappuccino Milkshake (they also had Amaretto, Chocolate, Mocha, Strawberry, Vanilla etc...)  It was GREAT!  The restaurant was very clean and modern-looking.  We had a nice time and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Je dois commencer par avouer avoir été pâtissière dans une vie passée et j'étais spécialisée dans tout ce qui était gâteau, tarte et cupcake. Ce que je considère comme étant bon, est donc un peu biaisé par mon passé.  Au départ, je m'attendais à n'y retrouver que des sucreries mais ça n'est pas le cas. Ils offrent des repas complets ainsi que plusieurs boissons alcoolisées. Mais puisqu'à chaque fois que j'y suis allée c'était pour le dessert, je n'ai goûté qu'aux gâteaux. Et ils sont bons. J'ai eu la chance de goûter à celui aux Oréos, celui chocolat-fromage-caramel et la croustade aux pommes. Je les ai tous aimé et les portions sont extrêmement généreuses. Même qu'en partageant un morceaux à deux, vous serez tous deux bien remplis!  Pourquoi juste 3 étoiles donc? Pour le service qui, bien que bon, est un peu détaché. On a un peu l'impression que les serveurs aimeraient mieux être ailleurs. Et aussi à cause de l'ambiance. Il manque quelque chose (peut-être un éclairage tamisé ou bien de la meilleure musique) pour que je puisse vouloir y rester un peu après avoir mangé mon gâteaux pour jaser et possiblement prendre un verre si la soirée est propice à ça. Je trouve que ça frôle le côté générique de cafés comme Second Cup, sauf avec des gâteaux et des tartes bien meilleurs!"}
{"text":"All I can say is.. I WISH WE HAD ONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.  Got the apple pie - YUM. Definitely wishing I had one here! The pies are huge, and usually I can eat a whole pie to myself, I only had a slice and I was stuffed. So delicious and it's great that they're open late for midnight munchies."}
{"text":"We took two slices of pie to go from the restaurant when walking by.  Was very fresh and flavorful.  My wife had the Apple Crumb and I had the strawberry peach crumb.  Both were delicious, just wish we had a way to heat them up at our hotel.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Mainly a dessert place but they do have some other food. I came for an early dinner and ordered some tortellini, which was OK.  My husband ordered a Thai wrap which was pretty good. Both came with Caesar salads. Again, all safe choices.  For dessert we had some really great Oreo cheesecake. Their strong point is clearly in the pies and cakes they make."}
{"text":"Grosse portion de gateau par personne,  terrasse disponible ainsi que limonade maison et repas mais je pense que l'interet vient surtout de leur tartes."}
{"text":"Ok so I can only review one kinda pie here cause I have yet to move on to the next (it's been about 10 years but who's counting) it was called Bananasplit, but now it's called Banalicious.....don't matter cause it is to die for no matter what you call it.  Light not too sweet (which is almost impossible but somehow true), chocolate cake and bananas, rich whipped cream and sinfully moist cake,  I rest my case, 23.95 gets you a whole pie, write happy birthday, congrats on your graduation, enjoy your oil change.....it's all good  mmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"OMG. Can they open a location in Los Angeles. We loved it. Geeses, where do I began, the portions are huge and the coffee was great. You can't go wrong with whatever dessert you buy!!!!"}
