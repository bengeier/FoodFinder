{"text":"Have never ordered anything off of the Schlotzsky's menu here. I come here for Cinnabon. Restaurant is decent and clean, not immaculate. The staff is ok. Cinnabon is pricey, but that's nothing new. Way yummy though!"}
{"text":"Came in to a very relaxed atmosphere.clean and hospitable.Wife has been trying to watch her weight so calories marked on menu for different items a big plus for us.Wide range of items to choose from was grand.Even for a carnivore like me.Sandwich came 2 table looking and smelling grand..Tasted great..Sourdough bread a new fav of mine.great experience.will b back soon."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Schlotzsky's for over 3 years maybe 3 times a month and haven't have a sub-par sandwich ONCE. It's truly great how they have never slacked on quality.   I've always gotten the Turkey Bacon Club w/ no tomato and it's to die for.  The bread, meats, and cheeses always taste fresh. The customer service is very nice and friendly and the combo meal (which is what I get) isn't too pricey.   It's safe to say that this place will stay in my top 3 favorite restaurants for a long time!"}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time. N boyyyy was it good.should have this n reno Nv. I will b here a lot tho."}
{"text":"Love love love Schlotzskys. I have frequented the one on 90th and Shea. It's kind of hard to get to only because that intersection is so jam-packed all the time. The food is great and consistent. I only gave it 4 stars because the staff is not the friendliest and sometimes forget things (no onions, horseradish, etc.). This is the closest one to my house. If it were to be any closer, I'd be in big trouble."}
{"text":"Deluxe originals were very good.  Restaurant was  Spotless and the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"What a joke to advertise delivery and cancel orders after they are made through uber eats."}
{"text":"The first time I went there, it took almost 20 minutes to get our food. The guy took the order and then went back and cooked the food. The second time I called ahead and the guy was rude and sarcastic. I really like Schlotsky's food, but their customer service needs help."}
{"text":"I sat in the drive thru waiting for my food for 10 minutes and was not even busy.  slow service. And they gave me the wrong order."}
{"text":"I worked here for a good three months let me say, it's always dirty in the back staff doesn't care about the food our quality. That's the reason I left. The workers where do mean to me I went home crying most nights. Ave it's beyond over priced.. They use stale bread and serve cold soup..  Employees NEVER check expiration dates many times use expired food grouse."}
{"text":"I love coming here and it's worth the drive from Charlotte. I always order the small sourdough original sandwich with extra  extra turkey"}
{"text":"This location has been here for years and it's one of the few things I can trace back to my childhood. The service is always speedy and it's always clean and busy inside. I usually order a turkey sandwich and it's made fresh when you order it. The bread tastes light and airy and the sandwiches leave you feeling good not sluggish or overly stuffed. I hope this location will be here for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Only 1 order ahead of my 1 sandwich to-go and it took 25 minutes. When I asked about my sandwich the girl said they lost my ticket. No apology--then it took another 10 minutes to make my sandwich!!! 35 min. for fast food!!! Horrible!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Schlotzsky's for lunch yesterday (9-28). We decided to share a large French Dip sandwich, chips, and a drink. When the cashier said, \"$16.73\", I thought he mistakenly charged us for two sandwiches. Nope. The sandwich was $12.49 by itself. Add chips, drink, and tax, that comes to $16.73. Wow. For a few dollars more we could have eaten at the Carnegie Deli in the Mirage, and got a GIANT sandwich. Oh, I forgot to mention, the overpriced sandwich had less meat on it than a junior roast beef at Arby's (the 99 cent sandwich). I could not believe how skimpy the portion was, so I informed the cashier I was unhappy with the portion size. His only response was, \"Sorry\". I then asked for the manager. His response was, \"That's the recipe\".  In conclusion, if you want average tasting food, high prices, tiny portions, and non-existent customer service, this is the place to go!   I will try to upload the picture I took of the sandwich, see for yourself if I'm exaggerating."}
{"text":"This is my fourth visit. Sometimes a good place can have a bad day but this place is consistently dirty and the food is expensive for what you get. I have to admit I like their beef chief sandwich but the young lady serving me said they discontinued it. So I have no reason to ever come back. I'd find something else on the menu to like if the place wasn't expensive and poorly managed."}
{"text":"I Love this place! I came into this location today for lunch, and let me tell you, it was an overall great experience! The service was quick and super friendly. They made my sandwich very quickly and I was eating within minutes!  I ordered the Ciabatta Tuscan and it was literally the best sandwich I've ever had! Not sure if its just the sandwich or the people working there but it was amazing!  Charlene took my order and recommended the sandwich to me and I am so glad she did! Also Judd delivered it for me and he was very nice and helpful.  I will definitely return to Schlotzky's very soon!"}
{"text":"I just moved here from Los Angeles so I definitely was in search of some good food and friendly people. I had a great experience here and I am definitely making this a spot for myself.  I haven't found too many places to rant about but I loved everything about my experience I had to share ."}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed with what I ate.. I'd rather go to a Mexican place to get a quesadilla."}
{"text":"Im so thankful there is still one in town. Always tasty and consistent. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"First time I had been to this location in a long time, now I know why it was so long. The cashier told me when I asked what was good today she says \"everything\" like she was trained but then she says I don't eat here. You could tell she nor her coworker at the counter liked their job. We waited sooooo long for our food and all the time there was only 3 tables in the restaurant. When our food came the guy just sat them down and left. Didn't ask who ordered what, just left. During our wait time we couldn't help but hear the conversation going on with the manager and other employees. Cursing, name calling and she stated \"this is why I don't like training new employees.\" She called him a \"gay f***ing Mexican mother f***er.\" Employee siting behind us said as he was talking to someone on the phone \"I didn't even have to interview, I just walked in, because I'm awesome.\" He was the other person behind the counter when we came in and trust me...he is not awesome. The cook was on the phone complaining and you could hear her in the dining area. Tables were dirty, lots of soda was out, service counter was dirty. Very disappointed.  I go to the church by there, Palm Valley. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Not good. One person out front she was obsessed with sweeping. Didn't acknowledge us entering. When asked about certain items that might be allergic. She had no clue. 3 people working only one had the the wherewithal to smile and fix our order. I'm not coming back in to this store."}
{"text":"For a fast food like place, this restaurant is actually pretty darn good. They have a great variety of sandwiches, salads, flat breads, pizzas, etc. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that they are just a bit expensive for what they have."}
{"text":"By far the best place to grab a sandwich or salad. Not your normal 'fast food' feel. Use real plates. Manager treats you like royalty. Never a bad experience"}
{"text":"I went here only for a cinnabon.  It's $3.45 for one cinnabon so I expected it to be awesome.  It was my first time there and my pregnancy craving was going nuts for a cinnabon.   I ordered, the no smile, no welcoming feeling of the server (completely zombified) boxed up my cinnabon and I went on home.  I was so bummed, I opened the box and it is all dry and was a depressed, pathetic little cinnabon.  It was so fun eating it, I almsot had to force it down my throat it was so dry!   Next time, I am going to go to Ikea to get a cinnamon roll where it is huge, only costs $1.. warm, ooey gooey with icing and loaded calories and is like Christmas morning in my mouth.."}
{"text":"Horrible drive thru... one car ahead of me and wait was over 10 minutes and my food wasn't even ready. Do not stop here if you are wanting fast service."}
{"text":"Visit this restaurant occasionally and  the sandwiches are great but service and cleaniness are subpar.  The tables are frequently dirty and trashcans overflowing.  The service at times is almost nonexistent, and when extra condiments (i.e. salt/pepper) are requested, the employees' demeanor is definitely not friendly but more of an inconvenience.  Evidently this type of service is acceptable and consistent with corporate policy as complaints/service surveys are ignored even when you ask for a representative to contact you."}
{"text":"Not sure why this Schlotsky's only scores 3 stars.  It was great to me and I've been to many good ones and a bad one.  My pizza was really good and my wife's sandwich was enjoyed just as much."}
{"text":"After seeing a advert claiming that Schlotzky's is not just a sandwich I had to find out for myself. Upon entering the restaurant I was pleasantly greeted by a kind worker and bountiful menu. The rueben sandwich was pretty good and all but not quite worth the 7$$$. The bathroom was comfortable but for a single person and my time in there felt rushed. 3.5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Family of 11, we eat there often. As usual our order is made correctly. Never a complaint from anyone. They have awesome breakfast and lunch sandwiches. Pizza and Cinnabon cinnamon rolls. We buy extra to bring home. Even their bread. The staff is always friendly and the owner always knows it's us when we drive in. He greats our family as usual and always makes sure we are taken care of. They even have a rewards program and send coupons thru ur app. Would definitely recommend! Wish they had more loctions but the drive for us is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great salads and sandwiches, if a little pricy. However the quality is generally very good, you get what you pay for.  This store can be a little dirty sometimes, and they often forget to include items in our order, but we go back because the food is good."}
{"text":"Service is really slow, usually wait a good ten minutes before my food is ready. However the staff is actually very friendly and the food is really good. Definitely will come back even if the wait time is a little long."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have added breakfast and a Freestyle Coke Machine! There are so many choices and things to try. I love the drive thru and the inside is very comfortable and clean. You can tell that the place has been around awhile but the workers take pride in what they do. Delicious! Must try!"}
{"text":"After a quick return trip to the Sketchers store in the outlet mall, i had a hankering for Schlotzkys and thirsty for iced tea with lemon.  Thanks  Scott D. for planting the seed in my head.:)  My experience was surprisingly pleasant. I ordered the Texas Schlotzkys, with jalapeno cheese bread, ham, the works, plus more peppers, (ah, a trip down memory lane coming from Texas).  It was just as it always was, a little pricey, but very good, and then there's that smell that's uniquely Schlotzkys of buns baking when you walk in.  Only downside for me, was i ordered iced tea and the vat it comes in was down to the dregs... and tasted it.  Yuck.  Fortunately, that was corrected within minutes.  Took home the other half sandwich for leftovers."}
{"text":"I used to love going here. They had amazing sandwiches and pizzas. The quality of the food is great too, however. The service is the worst, especially at this location. Some dumb girl took my order, I repeated myself, no pickles.  I hate pickles. Still got it wrong cuz I guess her orange spray tan contaminated her hearing. This has happened a few times already. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I had called in to ask about fresh cinnabons. I was quoted $15.00+tax and that it would take 35-45min.I told the lady okay I would call back. So we decided we wanted them and would wait. I call back and \"Julie\" answers to make a long story short she would not make me fresh cinnabons unless I was charged per roll even though I was just quoted $15+tax for a 6 pack of fresh rolls. She began literally yelling at me over the phone refused to give me corporate number then tells me she is the district manager!  Poor poor poor customer service! We will never go to this location and do not recommend it for any one. Take the extra drive and go where the customer service is better. For a \"supposedly\"  district manager to act the way she did which in fact I do not believe she is a manager at all but regardless you don't treat customers that way!"}
{"text":"I tried the new Big Dipper Pretzel sandwich.  It was tiny and did stand up to the regular sandwiches.  The service wasn't very good.  Crew were having fairly loud personal conversations."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich usually get the original the sourdough bread is just awesome, all the ingredients are very fresh.   Service was good the prices are reasonable place very clean.   The place originated in Texas I lived in Texas in the 80s and discovered it back then was excited when I came to this area been there several times and will continue to do so  just love the bread."}
{"text":"The sandwich was decent but this is food court food.  I got the Philly Cheesesteak and as someone who has had a real Philly Cheesesteak it doesn't come close.  That doesn't mean it was a horrible sandwich.  The bread was fresh but the meats & veggies left something to be desired.  It came with a cup of broth that I dipped the sandwich in and when I was done I realized it was French Onion soup."}
{"text":"I have been going to Schlotskys for almost 30 years. The one I went to back then was on Broadway and Dobson. I was so happy when opened up several years ago close to home. This location has awesome food and the employees are very nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Last time I went there, they doubled my order on accident and charged me for it. They ended up correctly it, just annoying. Today I asked for a cup of soup, charged me for a bowl and gave me a cup. On top of that, they forgot the Au Jus with the sandwich. Get it together!"}
{"text":"This location rocks, great service, friendly, fast, hot and good! The customer service is really great.  There is one older gentleman who I happen to see often, not sure if he's the manager or what but he is great, he makes you feel like you've known him for years.  He is very quick and pays attention to details.  I recommend this location, I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I was a regular customer. so regular that this was my second visit today. then the manager tried to cheat me by overcharging me  50 cents. Not a mistake on his part, It was on purpose.  Like said, I WAS a regular customer."}
{"text":"This Schlotzsky's is AMAZING. The service is amazing! I ordered a Turkey Bacon Club, which was outstanding, and a small cinnamon roll. So while I was eating, my father walked up to see if my cinnamon roll is coming, and the lady apologized for forgetting about it and gave me the larger cinnamon roll! Made my day."}
{"text":"came here for the Cinnabon. The Cinnabon case was stocked full, everything looked amazing and fresh. Boy, was I not ready for how horrible it was. The guy asked me if I wanted my Cinnabon warmed up, I said yes. When I got it, it was lukewarm at best.   the whole outer edge of the Cinnabon was hard as a rock, and I couldn't chew it--I had to spit it out. I figured I'd take a bite out of the soft middle, and omg. it was so nasty. I swear it tasted NOTHING like the Cinnabon i've ever had (I'm a Cinnabon connoisseur--I KNOW what a real Cinnabon tastes like!). it had a very funky taste and again, I had to spit it out. I threw the rest of it away.  if you love Cinnabon and are hoping to get a good one here-- STAY AWAY! This IS NOT an authentic Cinnabon! Don't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"Schlotzskys is my favorite place to get a sandwich hands down. I also want to say that my rating is strictly based on my most recent experience. This location is a favorite of mine because the owner is so friendly & always remembers my order and even knows where I work & always makes it a point to say hi at my work. Today I decided I would get a sandwich from this location which is about a 20 minute drive from where I live. Let me add that I'm 8 months pregnant with gestational diabetes so I am forced to limit my carb intake. So I figured they would have my back. I went through the drive through & ordered a medium turkey original on wheat add jalapeños. That's it. No drink because I have water at home and can't have any sugar. I only waited a short time before my sandwich was ready & I was on my way back home to enjoy it. 20 minutes later I get home unwrap my sandwich to see that it's not on wheat bread so I can only eat a quarter of it (due to the amount of carbs in the white bread) but I realize that it's got a layer of jalapeños and no lettuce. The lettuce makes the sandwich! Normally I would have eaten it there but like I said I'm 8 months pregnant & wanted to get home. Now I'm stuck with this sandwich that I can only eat in quarter increments per hour, that's not even what I ordered."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed eating here. I've been coming to this location for about 10 years and the food has always been good and keeps me coming back. My favorites are their pizzas and original sandwiches. The price is about average compared to other sandwich shops but they have a unique flavor that's really enjoyable."}
{"text":"This was my first time in this location since their recent store remodel.  WOW--what a great experience.  We ordered sandwiches, salad and soup and everything was fresh and delicious.  We are having a party over the weekend and plan on using their catering service!  Yummiest sandwiches in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I definitely WOULD NOT recommend this Cinnabon. Every time I go to a Cinnabon their rolls are fresh and not dry. They have always had a good reputation to me.   This location, however, have given me multiple rolls that are dry every single time I've gone. They claim they are freshly made but what I receive tells a completely different story. I suggest either going to the one in Metro mall for the closest location or the one on 1401 Southern Ave. It's far but it's worth the drive. Just saving you money and dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"Absolute baffoonery! The competence of the staff makes me want to reverse my stance in support of a better wage for fast food workers. It took about 15 minutes to get my to go order. Then, it was wrong, so it took another 10 of waiting to get the correct order. Basically that was the case for the people before and after me. I feel super lame for taking the time to write a bad review for a fast-food joint, when a lot of people are starving to death and much bigger issues face humanity, but holy shit - if I was starving, I would probably rather eat my own baby than go back to this Schlotsky's again.   (*fyi, I would never seriously eat my own baby. In fact, I wouldn't eat anyone's baby.)  P.S. The food wasn't terrible. But I'll probably need a few months of therapy to restore my faith in humanity's ability to follow simple instruction."}
{"text":"My friend Brian and I are always having date night here at Schlotzky's Deli, We order the medium size turkey club sandwich on sourdough bread and the Vegetarian Pizza. Fresh vegetables, and bread are always delicious, this is plenty for us, and leftovers for the following day.   We also enjoy the Cinnabon cinnamon rolls, or fresh baked chocolate chips cookies. I prefer the raisin cookies.  The order taker is always friendly and polite and recommends drinks or dessert, we have only had to wait a few minutes for our order to be brought out to our table.   One of my favorites is the green tea with fresh lemon, but Brian prefers soda."}
{"text":"Although it says Schlotzsky's on the outside, inside you'd think you were in a Cinnabon establishment.  No matter.  The Original Schlotzsky's sandwiches are very good and the have the standard selection that has made this franchise famous.  (Love that sauce!!) Nice place - always clean."}
{"text":"The Original on Sourdough is still one of the best sandwiches. Service here was very good. Clean restrooms and friendly staff. A little hard to get too if you don't know the area."}
{"text":"I ordered a Sandwich, drink and chips which totaled $12.07.  Once I realized that the drink came in a large Styrofoam cup I asked that the order be changed to a medium drink which was a reusable plastic cup.  The cashier informed me that I could have the plastic cup, but since she already totaled the order she would have to charge me the higher price and refused to alter my order on the point of sale terminal.  I let them keep their twelve dollar sandwich and walked.  Who needs a twelve dollar sandwich anyway."}
{"text":"Very good food definitely worth checking out. Had a pastrami that was best I've had in the area. If you can't go to a traditional deli, check this place out"}
{"text":"I bought food here thinking it would be a good option for my family. Boy was I wrong. They messed up our order TWICE, and the food wasn't the best."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, their sandwiches are delicious. The veggies always taste fresh.   The place is admittedly pretty outdated looking, the parking lot is kind of a pain in the butt to get into, but it's worth it.   The owner has quite the personality. He's funny, if you come here often he remembers you.   Try the jalapeño chips! Sometimes I come back just for those!! And sign up for their email subscription, they send out coupons all the time."}
{"text":"Went here to get dinner. My husband got a medium Angus beef and cheese and requested no pickles (it did have them when he got his sandwich) and requested to add pepperchinis (which weren't on the sandwich). I got a turkey bacon club and when I got my sandwich most of the turkey was pushed to one side. When I started moving the turkey to make an the sandwich more consistent, there was a TON of pepper in it. I was just really disappointed."}
{"text":"Took in a free cinnibon coupon I had received from the cinnibon club. Turns out they're only good for the mall locations (do those even exist anymore??) and the coupon says absolutely nothing to that affect.  Schlotzky's owner graciously stepped in when I was turned down (cashier was very pleasant and doing her job) and honored the coupon (at fully his expense). Such a nice change of pace, knowing most places point to corporate protocol with nothing more than a shrug. Awesome customer service, not only will I continue to take my business there, I will recommend this location specifically to others."}
{"text":"I llke the original on sourdough. The bread makes this sandwich!  If only the restaurant was open after 8:00pm."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and child on a fun day trip to the zoo. The food was exactly what I remembered from like 7 years ago which was the last time I had it. I gave no complaints about the food but the cashier was was lost. I wouldn't be surprised if he was high. I didn't think it was humanly possible but I think he got dumber while I was at the restaurant.  If I were the manager of this establishment I would remove him from the eye of the paying public."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this location.  We ordered our food ahead of time and gave them a specific time of when it needed to deliver it by.  It took over an hour to get it.  First, they got our address wrong when we told them no more than 5 times.  Second, it was very difficult to get a hold of them.  It took about 5 tries for them to finally answer their phones.  They claimed that the driver wouldn't answer their phone.  They brought up someone else's order.  My manager had to drive down there and see what the issue was and our food was still at the restaurant waiting to be picked up and he made sure that they threw it away and had them make it again.  I was on the phone with an employee while my manager was on the way and she asked me to give the driver another 10 minutes  and all I could tell her was that we've been waiting for almost an hour, why?  If any of you want to go to a Schlotzsky's, don't go to the Southern location.  You will get bad service, you won't be able to get through 5 calls later and they'll put you on hold and forget you are there"}
{"text":"I love the sandwich here but they don't keep enough large sandwich bread. You can easily get small or medium but large is available in limited quantities."}
{"text":"It has great food and quick service for a good price, I like that there is also a cinnabon."}
{"text":"The food was cold at best and when I asked them to remake my food it took 45 minutes and then they ran out of what I originally ordered. The sandwich would have been small for the price, if it was consumable. Not impressed. Wish I could give 0 stars.   Also, they forgot my pickle."}
{"text":"Horrible Management.  Negative attitude but the staff seem to try.  The Management hates honoring coupons and even told me that on one of my visits and they have giving me issues with my coupon's off their e-club everytime.  It is a waste of time.  I am going to switch my e-club membership to another Schlotzky's.  My little girl is disappointed everytime they have an offer and she is excited and then upset at them when we leave because they give us such a hard time about using them there."}
{"text":"I was looking at the menu and there is no decriptions for any of the sandwhiches and there cups were really cheap broke one after i filled it up and most of there soda selection was empty and was really expensive for just a sandwich i should have went to del taco like skylor did, geno you son of a fire."}
{"text":"This place is LOTZ BETTER then any other sandwich place. Maggie makes the best sandwiches ever!"}
{"text":"Fourty five minutes for two sandwiches come on.... Staff properly. The new girl at the registrar screwed up the order twice, then we sat 45 minutes for two sandwiches along with the rest of the place of starving people. Will never come back! They say they cater it would be scary to see how long they would take to get it to my office!"}
{"text":"I love Schlotsky\"s and am thrilled the W. Charleston location exists. The service is always great & the sandwiches too. They also make fantastic salads!! Long-time customer and intend to continue coming."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST service!! Went there this morning and seriously doubt I will go back. My boyfriend and I were the only ones there so being busy couldn't be why the staff was so bad. After ordering our sandwiches, we sat down and waited. The girl brought our food out and as she was handing me a sandwich, the top of the bun fell off and into my lap. Mayo and lettuce all down my shirt and in my lap. All she said was \"Opps!\" ... Come on now, not even an apology? Accident or not, proper customer service certainly warrants at least an \"I'm sorry.\" After eating, we needed a container to take part of a sandwich home so I went to the counter. I waited, and waited ... And waited. I walked over to the opening in wall where they place orders and waited some more. 10 minutes went by and not one employee was around or even seen. After saying \"hello??\" several times, a guy came out looking annoyed. I got my container and he disappeared again. With all the product that they have sitting out front, you would think that a staff member would be in the front at all times. I have to wonder what was so important in the back that it required ALL the staff in the building to be back there?? When leaving, not one employee was to be seen or heard so I yelled \"Bye, have a great day! Thanks for coming.\" and walked out. Simply put, this was the WORST customer service (or lack of it) ever! The manager better think about hiring some new people soon because with staff like that, money will be walking out the door."}
{"text":"WORST. 'FAST FOOD'. EXPERIENCE. EVER.    PLEASE NOTE:  Below is an update, and took place a few hours after I wrote initial review.   FURTHER NOTE:  '1 Star' was the lowest rating that could be given.  'Yelp' needs to develop a 'negative number', or 'negative star' system.  '1 Star' is far too generous for this place.   The 'new' stunningly 'bad experience' is identified at bottom of this page.  The owner of this place must have 'rocks in his head'.   I strongly recommend that all people who are considering dining at this Schlotzsky's avoid doing so.  Possibly other locations are more professionally run.  Please read my review, as well as the reviews of others.  The negative reviews posted reflect my own experience.     Everything that follows is true and accurate.    I will be asking Schlotzsky's corporate office, and/or regional/district manager to review available video of this experience, and owner's behaviors.  Review of video(s) should confirm the accuracy of what I am writing.    This includes that I will make a one-time offer to meet with the above 'corporate person' to identify what, if any, questions they have for me and to confirm the accuracy of the information provided-- once the video footage has been reviewed by them.    Additionally, do not take 'my word', solely, regarding this Schlotzsky's location.  I reviewed other 'reviews' of this particular location.    In regards to the above, the negative reviews are too negative and too specific.  There is something going on at this place that I cannot put my finger on (although, I am not going to expend too much energy attempting to figure this out).    Possibly owner is suffering from a detrimental form of mental illness (Bi-polar I or II?  Diagnosed?  Not diagnosed?).  Odd and unusual behaviors on his part, to state/write the least.    This is a very simple business (compared to other businesses, and my former businesses), and the reviews of this place (the negative/harsh ones) are just too harsh; but, I believe they may very well be accurate.     Please note the following.  Again, original review is at top of page, with supplemental/secondary review at bottom.    REVIEW #1:   My Experience at Schlotzsky's, in Mesa, Arizona, on 'Customer Appreciation Day', on December 9, 2017    The following was my experience at Schlotzsky's, in Mesa, Arizona, on December 9, 2017-- also, this was Schlotzsky's 'Customer Appreciation' Day.  I thought this was the first ever 'on-line' review I had done.  Turns out a few years ago, I had completed a review, strongly complimenting my experiences with an auto repair shop.  This review is not meant as a 'compliment'.  Far from it.  Again, please note all of the following.   I am a retired attorney; retired psychologist; and retired consultant in high conflict divorce and custody cases involving individuals with Narcissist Personality Disorder (NPD).    I also have a number of other professional credentials and certifications, and I have fulfilled a number of other professional roles during my career; and, I am a former member of The American Psychological Association, as well as having previously been a member of a number of other professional organizations/associations.  Currently, I am house-sitting/dog-sitting in Chandler, Arizona, for the past couple of months, for a friend, and former tenant of mine, who is a professor at ASU, and presently on sabbatical.  I recently 'discovered' Schlotzsky's, as they are 'few and far between', and just north of Chandler, and on Country Club Dr. at Juanita.  I spent years working from home in regards to my consulting business, and I frequently ventured to local business establishments to 'get out of the house', get some food, get a drink, or whatever, tip very well and work. Living and working from home can make a person a 'little stir-crazy', staring at the same four walls.   Currently, and this is relevant to this review, I am working '24/7' on a number of motions for some court proceedings myself and another individual are pursuing.  It is pretty much all I am doing right now with my life.    I have never had an experience like the following.  Not kidding.  Never.  I have eaten at Schlotzsky's a number of times over the past few days, including three (3) times the other day; twice yesterday; and, no kidding, twice today, between the approximate hours of 10 am, and 3 pm.   I am a little over 6', and approximately 195 pounds, but have a really big appetite.  Again, I arrived at Schlotzsky's around 10 am this morning (12/9/2017), as the line for Customer Appreciation Day was dwindling.    Upon my arrival at Schlotzsky's I began to work on a court-related document/petition for a colleague and some court proceedings.    Again, I placed two (2) separate orders at Schlotzsky's, today, while I diligently worked on some materials for a colleague, and a project he/we are working on.   After I placed my second (2nd) order, and before it arrived at my table, the owner/manager of establish"}
{"text":"We have been eating here since the place opened many years ago. Original owner was awesome and everything was always great. Since then, too many owners thru this location and the quality was hit and miss day by day. The last 2 visits were positive experiences, but that friendly \"welcome to my store, I want to make you happy\" attitude just isn't there......"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast and food was good. Sandwiches were cleat marked so we knew what was what. The flatbreads are really good. I liked the chicken avocado flat bread."}
{"text":"I love Schlotzsky's but this location is kind of a bummer. They used to have an employee named Theo who was the bomb! Knew exactly what we wanted to order, knew our kid's name, CARED. Now...you're just lucky if they get your order right the first time. Missing Theo!!!"}
{"text":"Best Hot Sandwiches In Town!!!!! Secret Recipe in their Dough is the Key!!! They are Very Addictive.... And I can't go long without one! Also was my first Job in Las Vegas!!!! I Also was on the news when I worked there on a story about raising the minimum wage while I still had my Southern Accent!!!!!! And my Glasses Yuck!!!! I think I was 15... Not sure, Can't Remember!!!! You can also call in your order ahead of time, if you don't like to wait!!!! My Favorite is the Deluxe Original with No Onions with Guacemole & Louisiana Hot Sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"Always quick service and very pleasant employees.  The menu has a decent variety of sandwiches and pizza options.  Great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for about a year. I love one of their salads. What I don't love is that every single time I have to question almost every single portion of my order when I receive it. I usually use the drive thru. You are supposed to receive breadsticks with your salad order and many times I don't receive them (something you pay for and is advertised). Almost every time I have to make sure I've received: dressing whether it be dressing at all or the correct one, breadsticks, the correct drink, and many times I'm so fixated on making sure my meal is correct I haven't noticed I didn't receive a copy of the receipt until I get home. I love Schlotzsky's and am so disappointed by this location's service. It is beyond poor. 3 stars for the taste of the salad I love only. I would love to see these things improve because I want to support this place!"}
{"text":"BEST sandwiches in town hands down! Worth the drive! Order The original! Pizzas are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Had more the 25 minutes left before they close, and right off the top was told to take out instead of sitting, I am posting this, so the owners know what there employees r doing"}
{"text":"Been eating here since I was kid, and still get excited like a kid when I walk in and order.."}
{"text":"Lady working the register was annoying AF. Repeated my simple order of the turkey sandwich at least three times. Once I got the sandwich I was very disappointed to realize I'd spent $15 (no chips or drink) $15 for a lettuce sandwich. Will not return to this location or any for that matter"}
{"text":"The food is delicious...... if you can actually get what you ordered.  The heavily eyelined woman at the counter was too busy with her cell phone to get our order right and two of the four sandwiches we ordered were completely wrong.  Then when I called, they offered a disingenuous apology and told me to bring back my receipt and the wrong sandwiches.  At this point, my dinner is already ruined and I have to leave for work.  Thank you Schlotsky's for taking my $32 and leaving me starving.     You should get some employees who actually pay attention and don't have their children running around the restaurant all day."}
{"text":"Always an excellent choice.  Schlotzsky's has been at their W Charleston location forever.  Unfortunately, this is the only location left (not on strip).  Excellent service, sandwiches, pizza and even a Cinnabon inside.  Give it a try!  Their bread is to die for."}
{"text":"Good food, lacking in bread choice- bread and sandwiches all have s similar taste. Nothing exciting, but good for an occasional change-up in restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time we have had lunch or dinner at this location, the staff is so polite and courteous. Very patient with the order process. Always with a smile and the quality of the food was outstanding, hot and delicious. Price is definitely worth it. High marks."}
{"text":"Came here about 20 minutes from closing. The guy who took our order couldn't have been nicer. You'd think we were the first customers in the day; friendly, made a great sandwich (love the French Bread they use) The restaurant was spotless, btw. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Went back today, had a few minutes on lunch break, ordered one sandwich.  26 minutes later it came...they just completely lost the order, and after pointing that out to them it still took them several minutes to figure out what I ordered, and several more to actually make it.  I take it home, and the bread is stale and hard.  I like Schlotzky's, but this location is terrible.  I know if I order a sandwich with jalapenos and no pickle, when I get home there will be a pickle and no jalapenos.  Sigh....get your act together guys."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The sandwich I ordered was very good. I had the pretzel bun sandwich dipper.   Since it was my first time, I was having a hard time trying to figure out what I wanted. The lady who took my order was very patient with me, i didnt feel like I was being rushed. They have a coke machine that you can make up your own drink if you like that kinda stuff oh and they have Cinnabon yumm!   Also,when the guy called out my name for my order he just had a big smile on his face when he handed me my food, it was really nice. The only reason why i didnt give it 5 star is because she up charged me when I requested ham instead of bacon on my sandwich. Isnt bacon more expensive than ham? Hmmm oh well...My sandwich was so good I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"We ended up not eating here because they would not honor the free sandwich coupon we had.  Would have been paying for three sandwiches in addition to drinks, so it doesn't seem like a really big deal for them to honor it. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with helpful, attentive employees. General Manager is usually working, delivering food, cleaning, stocking and helping customers. Food is delivered fresh and quickly. Fill out the questionnaire online from your receipt and receive a free sandwich on your next visit (with purchase of drink and chips). Less than $4 for lunch... not bad."}
{"text":"Of all the Schlotzsky's in the Valley, I like this one the best.  Don't know if it's location or franchisee or what, but their prices are cheaper and always delivers a good sandwich.  Nothing beats the balsamic and hot sauce they have on the side.  The Original is great and the Reuben ain't half-bad either!"}
{"text":"We just wanted two cinnibon rolls, it took 22 minutes, we got one plus three minis because they ran out of the regular. Not as good as the ones in the mall"}
{"text":"Just a bad experience. Like... Really bad. Zero customer service and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches the turkey original is my favorite. They aren't super fast but it's worth the wait. Way better then anything subway or paradise bakery has to offer. On a side note I tried the pizza one time and it was cold in the middle. Stick to the sammiches."}
{"text":"I first went to Schlotzsky's when I was living in Texas, and I was glad to see there are a few of them here in Las Vegas. This one is close to my house and easy to get to from anywhere in the Valley. It's always busy but never crowded, and you can get in and out pretty fast.  I had a free sandwich/pizza coupon for my birthday as a member of the Bun & Fun eClub, and I opted for the chicken and pesto pizza. Tasty, and a good-sized portion for lunch. (Plus free is always nice!) My husband had a medium reuben on rye, and it was pretty good, too. He usually gets the original sandwich on sourdough, and I usually get a vegetarian sandwich on wheat, so we mixed it up a little this time around. All four are great choices, depending on your mood.  If you want a quick, tasty sandwich (or a personal-sized pizza), give Schlotzsky's a try. And if you go there often, I suggest signing up for the Bun & Fun eClub online."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I love their bread so much, and their veggies are always so fresh. I wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"I wanted to be impressed because I have heard people mention that this place is good but I didn't think it was good at all. My first thought after I took a bite of my sandwhich was \"I could have just gone to Panera for a better sandwich\". I am not sure if it's the fact that they have way too many items on their menu or I just chose badly but I won't be returning. There are too many other great fast food places with more quality choices."}
{"text":"Summary: Overpriced, small portions, dining area dirty.  The sourdough sandwich roll and cinnibon are all this place has going for them.  Luckily, I only have dined here with coupons.  The sandwich and pizza are just ok and small.  For the price you pay I would expect bigger portions.  The dining room always has trash and food on the tables.  The floor is rarely swept.  The A/C vents layered with dust.  Some of the ceiling tiles water damaged and on the verge of breaking.  The manager is nice, apologized in the past but just don't see improvements in the place.   If you like this place,  you may feel much better just using the drive thru."}
{"text":"If you've never been to a Schlotzki's have a friend blind fold you and lead you into this one. If you let the look of the place influence your opinion you'll be doing yourself a disservice.   This place is old. The building. Like 20th century old.  But they've got it going on where it counts which is back in the kitchen. Like so many others, me and Schlotzki's met up in another state. I was in Louisiana playing with my rich Uncle Sam. Found that one by accident just like I found this one by accident.   To everyone who wrote a bad review about the food, you must be on Crack! Can't touch the bread. I took one star off because of the building. The stuff in the bag was on point. I was expecting a let down. Perhaps my memory of Schlotzki's was too much to live up to. They lived up to my memory exactly.   So go in blindfolded and enjoy what they do in the kitchen.  But for crying out loud get off the building crap. It's old. But ya don't eat the building.   Friendly staff, good eats. What else do you need?"}
{"text":"What happened?.... Are they under new ownership...something is different. Last few times I've been has not been a good experience. Place was dirty,meaning food on tables and floors and no one was there but me. Quality of food not the same and waited a real twenty minutes for sandwich and remember I'm the only one in the place....  Staff seems lost..... Something is different. Hate to be harsh, but COME ON SON!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for a chain I must say. Had the Reuben, which came out warmed and on dark rye. My only complaint would be the amount of meat. I'm used to deli-fied stacks of thin delicious meat.  Obviously cost prohibitive in the case of a chain. 99.0 sanitation rating which is better than half the upscale uptown restaurants.  Nice restrooms, friendly staff and plenty of free refills at the soda machines. Good thing the BF  works in Gastonia so we can come back. Oh and having a Cinnabon inside is brilliant!"}
{"text":"Good food, but unfortunately there is a girl (working tonight June 6 shift) and she does not understand why they wear disposable gloves. She takes your order, uses the phone, opens the window handles your cash or credit card then goes and makes your sandwich all with the same pair of gloves on. This isnt to protect the customer, as even the sweat from her brow is wiped off on the gloves. I think she thinks she is wearing them to protect herself from something? anyway the cross contamination from this employee caused me to toss my meal in the trash after I had a few mins to think about what all was on my sandwich besides what I ordered EW Maybe Management needs to explain to the help what purpose hand washing or gloves serve. Otherwise employees are friendly !"}
{"text":"Ordered 1 large and 4 mediums and a bag of chips. Girl at window screwed me out of one medium (found out when I got home) thats a $10 loss!!!   What makes matters worse is she had to be asked three times if she got everything and ALL THREE TIMES she brought one more thing out.   Why the hell i didn't count the items makes me pretty stupid but at least not so stupid because I'm never going there again!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place everyone I go I am treated with great customer service and my food is always hot and prepared  excellent!!"}
{"text":"The only sandwich place with a respectable vegetarian option. The fresh veggie sandwich is ACTUALLY fresh veggies: tomato, spinach, cucumbers, carrots, red onion, black olives & zesty ranch. Sub in the dark rye for extra yum."}
{"text":"My husband acquired a taste for Schlotzsky's while attending school at Texas A&M. Consequently, when he found out they were on the strip, he had to get his Schlotzsky's fix. It did not disappoint. In fact, we went back for another sandwich the next day. A special thank you to Shamae, for all her assistance in explaining the various sandwich options. Your customer service skills are extraordinary!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight to grab a quick dinner. I waited... And waited... And waited for someone to come to the window. The guy saw me finally, but stopped along the way to have a conversation with someone in the back. He finally got to the counter, I ordered my salad, paid and waited about 5 minutes. I reviewed my receipt and it said I ordered a chicken Cesar salad when in fact I ordered the BBQ chicken salad. So when my name was called I confirmed the correct salad the gal grabbed my receipt and explained they don't have a button for the salad. Ummm... Okay, a simple yes we made the BBQ salad would have been more than enough. I opened my salad to find bacon , I personally don't eat pork so picked it off which took off almost all the BBQ sauce. The salad did not have a description, and BBQ ranch salads are my favorite so I know they don't normally come with bacon otherwise I would have asked for no bacon. I am pretty disappointed with the service, salad,  and overall experience."}
{"text":"Schlotzsky's is a quick service sandwich chain. They serve a unique sandwich that I enjoyed very much. I also thought that the prices were reasonable. I did not like the cookies though and would recommend avoiding those even though they were cheap. Other than that its a solid place that I would return to."}
{"text":"Great everything, except the soda. They've appeared to set the syrup setting to the absolute minimum level so the soda tastes like colored water. We notice! Up the soda syrup a bit and earn that missing star please.."}
{"text":"Got the California Chicken Wrap. It tasted funny and smelt like fish. So when I took it up to the they offered to make me a new one. Are you kidding me?!?! No I would not like another fishy smelling chicken sandwich to which I was informed they don't do refunds. So what did I want. So I got the pizza. Which is good."}
{"text":"This is my girlfriend first  time here. We ordered the ham and cheese and bacon 6in it was very good. We will return."}
{"text":"I love This place! We've never heard of it up until my dad was obsessing about it the day he first tried it. He insisted taking the entire family to try It. We couldn't agree more! It was delicious. The Bread is so crispy and the sandwich combinations are incredible. Subway can't even compare to the quality of Schlotzskys sandwiches. There's no doubt we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This spot is okay. The quality of the food is lacking, we received brown avocado (I mean, fully brown) on our salad/sandwich, but other than that it was okay! The staff was super friendly and helpful. Overall wasn't super impressed."}
{"text":"I think they still have the best toasted sandwiches their rye bread is so damn good and there olive spread makes the sandwich with a lot of their hot sauce way better than Subway decently priced service is usually pretty bad though I put up with it because it's the closest to my house the others in Tempe"}
{"text":"I would just like to say that I love the \"Original\" Sandwich with no olives or mustard and their garlic sauce on the side...how could you go wrong?  They have really good baked potato soup too!  The bread is all fresh and warm!  And of course you cannot forget the Cinnabon cinnamon rolls!  YUMMMMMMMMMM!!!!  The manager here is awesome.  My office uses this place for lunch sometimes and once I forgot one thing and he was soooooooooooooo nice and got me what I needed and even gave me a free sandwich for the next time.  He even gave me a packet of their orange spice chai tea because I love it so much.  Their pizza is good too!  I like that there is a pesto sauce on it!  It's great for a quick lunch...they have a drive through and have awesome Jalepeno chips!"}
{"text":"Always live this place. Some of the staff isn't super friendly though. And I don't like how their menu is lacking. But always delicious!"}
{"text":"I love these sandwiches and the pizzas. The cinnamon rolls are the best! They have great customer service. My order was incorrect and the manager was quick to apologize and fix it. Because of Connor's great customer service and sincere appology, I will continue to come to this location and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"0820 in the am, the sign open wasn't on the mgr didn't even know, the inside was dirty, the soda machine disgusting, the countertops dirty, the floor dirty, the counter where you pick up food had crumbs all over it, this place needs the health department stat! Never going back!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Scholotzsky's now for over 5 years. I have never Yelped for them so since I had lunch there today I thought it was about time! There customer service is awesome. The Original sandwich and the turkey breast sandwich are my two absolute favorites here. There sourdough bread is baked fresh daily and is very good. The molasses wheat bread is also good if you are in to avoiding white flour.  I am a big sandwich junkie when it comes to lunch when I am working. I work 15 minutes away from this place but it is worth the drive to have one of there delicious sandwiches. The medium sandwich is equivalent to a large in my opinion. I always get the small since I am a female and find the medium to be too much. You guys out there could better finish the medium. Then there large sandwich is for those who have a serious appetite and seem to have skipped breakfast. This place does get very busy between 11:30-1 inside. I mostly go through the drive-thru since it is much faster in getting your meal. If you have not tried them check them out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Schlotzskys, but I would stay with the Deluxe Original.  I have had the corned beef but aside from the bun you can get better and more corned beef elsewhere.  The brisket is a little on the tasteless side.    So why 4 stars. The Original is the best thing running."}
{"text":"I have always been a HUGE fan of Schlotzskys! I remember going often when i was a kid! The food is still good tasty today! I think the icing on the cake for me is their Sourdough bread it is as good as it gets! I have yet to find better Sourdough bread! Also the combination of their sandwiches with their hot sauce! It never disappoints! If you are looking for a good sandwich place i recommend Schlotzskys!"}
{"text":"Wow, I am blown away by these place. I am glad there was a good amount of parking space. This place was clean inside and out, which a nice plus. Now for the good stuff. Norma took my order and was very attentive. She came to my table to check on me to see if everything was okay with my meal, and very professional. I ordered the Tuscan Sandwich and let me tell you, this was definitely best most delicious, juicy Tuscan Sandwich my mouth has EVER has the pleasure of tasting in more than a Decade, thanks to Guille the Chef/Cook for making me a really happy camper. To the owners of this establishment, kudos for having great employees that take pride in there work, because it shows."}
{"text":"Horrible.. flat bread was still cold and watery so they obviously just defrost it plus tasted like vinegar, breakfast burrito was 7 bucks and pathetically small and tasteless, not coming back"}
{"text":"While I know this place is a chain anyone who has not tried their sandwiches needs to come in at least once. The bread is delicious and holds up well under any of the fantastic combinations they offer.  They offer 3 different sizes of sandwich and the large will easily feed 2 people.  This particular location is clean and quiet for a Saturday evening.  It also boasts a Cinnabon within its doors in case you want a different kind of dessert. Kids eat free as well on Tuesdays a feature I will have try next time I have a craving for one of their filling creations."}
{"text":"I give it 3.5 stars!  I'm a fan of Schlotzsky's, have been since I was a kid.   For those who've never been, it's basically a sub shop. It's their bread more than anything that sets them apart. Their bread is sponge like, hard to explain but tasty.  I've known Schlotzsky's forever, and I noticed this place out of the corner of my eye driving through Vegas. So we stopped in. I ordered the Original, my gf ordered the smoked turkey and guacamole and our friend ordered the chicken chipotle. We all ordered the medium size, unless you're super starving or sharing, stick with the medium. The large is just huge.   I was totally satisfied, and so was our traveling companion. My gf though, not so much. I think I know why. The smoked turkey they use is really smoking. I wasn't sure if it was turkey or johnny walker black label in the sandwich. I think if it was regular oven roasted turkey, she'd like it a lot more.   I'd go back, and I wish we had them in LA."}
{"text":"Schlotsky's sandwiches are delicious! This location makes a great sandwich. They have salads. The counter help is friendly.   They also have Cinnabon if you want a sweet dessert!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch since we missed breakfast.  They had combo meals which include a sandwich, chips and a drink. You can customize your sandwich by picking out the type of bread.   I decided to go with the turkey bacon sandwich on wheat bread, regular potato chips and a small raspberry iced tea. After we place our order, she calls you by name. She ended up getting my hubby's name. The cashier gave us our chips and drinks. All we ended up waiting for was the sandwiches.   We grab a booth and waited. Our sandwiches took only 10 minutes to make before we got them. As I opened up my sandwich, I thought the bread was interesting. It tasted and looked more like a cross between a biscuit and English muffin. It was thick like a biscuit but crunchy on the outside. It was filled with turkey, bacon, cheese, tomato, mayonnaise and shredded lettuce. I didn't like the shredded lettuce because it kept falling out of my sandwich. It definitely was good. Very filling. The chips were similar to lay's potato chips. I enjoyed drinking my raspberry iced tea. Food overall was okay.   This location is inside the Excalibur in the food court. Plenty of seating near the food court."}
{"text":"The food is OK, the service is not. They were not serving many items on the menu. Their ice cream was super runny and they didn't offer to make it right, no discount, no apology, nothing."}
{"text":"Went in today, stood around for a few minutes, with the party going on in the back room. No staff anywhere to be seen, just a lot of laughing and goofing off in the back. After 5 minutes, I left, but then thought I should at least notify the manager. So I went. Ask in, and waited some more. I knocked, I yelled \"hello\" very loudly.... Nothing. I then went behind the counter, into be back room where the party was happening, asked for the \"manager\" said I was leaving because of the terrible service. He said he was the manager, but he was one of be two goofing off doing nothing, with myself and other customers waiting at the front desk. To the owner of this location, these 2 employees are really hurting your business, I'm a business owner, they would be fired immediately if I ever saw this kind of behavior. Time was 5:45, jan 5, and this isn't the first time I've had to wait at the front forever. Get some new staff and maybe I'll be back. 2 stars for decent food, terrible staff"}
{"text":"So I don't really see much of a point in reviewing tons of chain restaurants -- so, in general, I don't. Unless the place is either so much better -- or so much worse-- than its counterparts, that it needs to be noted. Unfortunately for this Schlotzsky's, it's the latter. I came here today for a quick lunch, because my husband had a craving for it. I'm used to this place because a) I used to work at a S.Deli in high school and b) there's one near my office, so I eat there a couple times a month.  This Schlotzsky's, however, totally screwed things up. From the lack of a bathroom to the surly cashier to my sandwich -- which was, honestly, missing two of its key ingredients, the entire lunch was a disappointment.  Even worse? My husbands pizza. Apparently, they ran out of pizza crusts. Because it came out on a SANDWICH BUN. A large bun, mind you, but STILL! Isn't that the sort of thing someone would warn you about when you order?  \"Oh, by the way, we're out of pizza crusts, so we can still make a pizza for you, but it will be on regular sourdough bread.\" Nope. Nothing. I'm definitely not bothering to come back here. Not when there's a Nellos and a  great falafel place so nearby."}
{"text":"Very nice little shop. I went in to get Cinnabun which was fresh and wonderful. Can't wait to try the sandwiches.  Update. The sandwiches are awesome. The breads are out of this world!"}
{"text":"No wonder I haven't been to this restaurant in ages... it was horrible. The food is overpriced and hardly consisted of real meat. The service was slow on top of it. I will never go there again. My kids chicken sandwich had almost no chicken!"}
{"text":"My Mom and Sister swear by this place. I think it's a really good sandwich place that has incredible bread, but it's not my favorite.  Speaking of the bread, it's delicious. It's the main reason this place is probably as popular as it is. It's fluffy, crispy, soft, flavorful, and fresh all at the same time. It's easily the best sandwich bread I've ever had in my life.  The sandwich itself was above average. I got the original and it had a really good combination of filling. One of the few sandwiches I enjoy that has mustard on it (I hate mustard!). Definitely the first sandwich you should try when you visit here."}
{"text":"Man the service was frickin awesome hat off to brittany took great care of us via drive thru cant wait to eat"}
{"text":"I took my family here after church Sunday. We were amazed with the quality of the sandwiches. They all tasted so good and they were made just right. The bread is so crispy and perfect. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent alternative to fast food. They have great quality ingredients and freshly baked bread. Their You Pick Two deal is awesome. There used to be a lady that always got my orders wrong, but I complained and now she's doesn't work there anymore so that's cool."}
{"text":"What a change in eating a sandwich. Nice. And hot. Flavor and texture of the sandwich is amazing"}
{"text":"We really like Schlotzsky's and wish there were more of them around. Unfortunately it is an expensive sandwich and the cinnamon rolls were old and stale tasting.  Can't beat an original."}
{"text":"Went to the counter at 7:45 pm on a Saturday night to grab a sandwich. Nobody at the counter, all the lights are on, drinks and cookies in the bins and on the counter. So I decided to go to the gift shop to grab some waters and sodas which took about ten minutes then headed back. Still nobody. The side window showed two female employees in the back making sandwiches. I yelled \"Hello?\" a few times but was ignored. How is this place in business? Needless to say I ate elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times. It's ok, but I'm not a big Schlotzsky's fan. I love subs and burgers, but TO ME they are just ok."}
{"text":"I came here for a breakfast stop on the way to the airport.  I got the egg and avocado sandwich. It was very mediocre but it did the trick.  The staff isn't very friendly early in the morning and didn't have much patience for someone who hasn't been there before.  If I was in a hurry and needed something quick I'd come back but not excited about trying anything else."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast.  Disgusting.  We ordered a breakfast quesadilla.  It was soooo greasy.  It was not heated up all the way so it was hot, cold, and the veggies has not been drained after being cooked so it was wet and soggy.  A small bottle of water was 3.09 almost as much as the disgusting food (4.99).   Coffee was 2.79 for 8 ounces.   Skip this nasty place.  Only saving grace was the young gal working this morning. She was very sweet and pleasant."}
{"text":"Well it is time for one of my reviews.  I have eaten at this Scholtzskys a few times.  I have always had good service.  The staff has always been friendly too.  I love the food a lot too.  I had a ham sandwich minus the tomatoes this afternoon with a coworker after a meeting.  My sandwich was good.  I had one of the large cookies there too and it was yummy.  I like this place and will continue to eat here.  Remember food is subjective too.  I think people get something they do not like and go way off the handle.  I am sure if you relay to the staff what you thought. They can find a sandwich you will enjoy.  They have a few choices there and I am sure there is one someone will like.  Cheers and have a great day."}
{"text":"I'm truly thankful I work down the street!  I love their sandwiches... their reuben is a great \"getting to know reuben \"type of sandwich.  The saurkraut is good, not too tangy for a novice reuben connisseur like me.  & They Serve Cinnabon Inside."}
{"text":"I went to Schlotzsky's in Texas...and in Vegas.  And it was amazing.  What happened?!  The bread was gross, the sandwich barely had any meat in it and was totally overpriced.  I'm totally confused--what happened to the amazing bread and the piled high sandwich I had?  Not to mention--once a year I get a Cinnabon cinnamon bun.  They sell them here.  Great, right?  NO!  It was lukewarm and DRY!  I feel guilty putting those calories into my body--if you're going to eat something sooooo sooooo bad, at least you should be able to enjoy it.  The girl at the counter had like zero personality...but I would've given the food a 1 star, anyways.  I'd rather take the hit-or-miss Gandalfo's!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely the worst place I've been to since moving to Arizona 6 months ago.  The service was terrible and the food was the same. I'll never go back there for anything unless I am purchasing the last sandwich on earth, but I don't think I LLC Lol ever go there again."}
{"text":"No shirtzsky. No shoezskys. No Schlotzsky's. This location didn't have that sign but I remember that from other times I've been to Schlotzsky's. Always thought that was funny. I do remember when this building used to house some mom n pop breakfast kind of place. Never ate there when it was a breakfast place though. I've been to this Schlotzsky's for lunch, though, over the years whenever I was in this neighborhood for various services - there's a Discount Tire right next door for example. This is the perfect place to bide your time while waiting. This last time I opted for a medium Angus Roast Beef & Cheese sandwich. Pretty much just a regular fast food sammich, right? But the tasty Sourdough buns made me remember why I stopped here and didn't keep going further down the street. Also had the macaroni salad which was alright but otherwise not that memorable. You need the code to get into the bathrooms - I suppose to keep non-customers from loitering and just coming in to use the bathroom. That said, bathrooms were pretty clean. Lots of parking in this mall."}
{"text":"I should probably prepare you. You are going to read a harsh review, and you might think I am crazy for even stepping foot into this business...particularly if you read my reviews.  I was starving, and driving by one day, and needed a bite. I was desperate. This was my only choice because at the time, I didn't really know my way around town. I didn't have an iPhone. I had a piece of shit Blackberry.  ANYWAY...The sandwiches are pricey, the bread tastes like hot, sick, ass (whatever that tastes like), and the parking at this location is more painful than a trip to the urologist when you have kidney stones.  I had the Smoked Turkey Breast Sandwich (I know...appetizing after a mention of kidney stones and urologist ha), and the bread was dry, stale and should have been used for bread pudding or croutons. The tomato was mushy. The lettuce was limp.   I had a horrible experience, and I sadly would not come back.   Maybe it's because I'm a sandwich snob. Chains can get a sandwich right (see Capriotti's, Jimmy Johns...hell even Subway built a business on sandwiches and I hate that place).   In summary, and in the famous words of Yelp.....\"Eek! Methinks not.\""}
{"text":"I like the food.  Always good.  The service at this location stinks big time.  It took over 30 minutes to make a sandwich.  One employee moved at the blazing speed of a sloth."}
{"text":"This store is much better than the one by Metro Center. Their cookies are delicious! They do a great job catering and the owners are very nice."}
{"text":"This store is awful! The one up on Bell is much better. They use different recipes. Cookies here are gross."}
{"text":"It's a hundred thousand degrees out today with 80% humidity, and I have the plague, AKA a horrible cold.   After working 10 hours, all I wanted was soup, juice, and my bed. I was driving home deliriously trying to remember the soup talk thread, so I could find a place with soup. I remembered nothing, so I drove aimlessly around Old Town. Then I saw Pita House, and decided to see if they had soup. I walked in, no one was out the counter, and it smelled like stinky shoes and ass. I had to turn around and leave, I could not take that smell. I am already sick.   I walked next door into Schlotzsky's simply because I was exhausted and it was there. I asked if they had soup, and without making fun of me the guy pointed to the two huge pots of soup next to the register.  I got the wild rice with chicken. It was like three dollars, and it was fantastic. I am in love. Everything about it was good. I also got a piece of carrot cake, which was gross, but who cares, my whole bill was only $5.81!  I love soup!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We used to have one locally but unfortunately, it went out of business. Almost all the sandwiches are good as well as the pizza."}
{"text":"Generally when I got to a deli, I expect sandwiches and most likely soup. Here, the sky's the limit with sandwiches, flatbreads, and now even pizzas. But the salads are all super-basic and the soups are limited to two a day, in bizarre flavors like cheese-bacon or boring standbys like chicken and rice.   Sandwiches are fine here, fresh with good sauces- I particularly like their fiesta chicken with a chipotle sauce, and give them props for having pesto on more than one single sandwich.   Service is friendly, location interior is much nicer than the run-down exterior would suggest- lived down the street for months before I realized it wasn't closed down!"}
{"text":"Went here with a coupon the other day. BOGO pizza. The pizza was good. Not too many choices, but can't go wrong with Pepperoni and cheese. The service was good - welcomed with a smile, said thanks for coming when we left. They do have a coke machine and they offer cinnabuns which is cool. I've heard there sandwiches aren't good, but can't confirm (i didn't take my chances). The bread choices seemed odd.  Biggest downfall was price. I would not go back and pay $6.99 for a small, thin crust pizza with one topping. I will also not go back and pay $4 for a small cinnamon roll (although it is tempting). Without a coupon I can think of a dozen other places I'd rather go where I'd get even more for my $."}
{"text":"Nasty, rude employees.  The bathrooms are horrible.  They always close early: went to drive through 20; minutes before closing, and they ignored me. I called, and a girl told me they were closed. Not the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"Our family had lunch here. The sandwiches were great. Our daughter had a salad that was just ok."}
{"text":"Down the street from my office, I love this place! The turkey bacon sandwich with lots of their spicy sauce is delicious! And the lady at the cashier always has a joke or pun to tell, makes a crappy day into a better one."}
{"text":"This one of those two places in one.  Half of the store is a Carvel Ice Cream which I've never seen anyone use.   It might be more popular during the summer. You will find a separate Yelp listing for this.  The other half is a Schlotzsky's sandwich store.  I've loved Schlotzsky's since the one over by ASU existed .  After classes I used to go there frequently.  The Schlotzsky's original sandwich is so tasty.  I wish this Schlotzsky's was closer to my part of Mesa, but its worth the drive."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to give this place a visit. Mostly because they have gluten free bread so he can get a decent sandwich. Or so we thought.  Very underwhelmed by our choice in sandwiches. I had half of the turkey avocado, he had the Angus and Cheese Sandwiches weren't terrible but they weren't anything to write home about.  I also had the smokey brisketeer mac. HUGE mistake. It was a pile of cheesy mush covered in barbecue sauce, pickled jalapeños and roasted red peppers. NO BRISKET. Like really guys...fail.... The manager offered a new one to go for free but by that point I was over it.  Needless to say we probably won't be back.  Disappointed to say the least"}
{"text":"This place caught me off guard. Never heard of it until I spotted it on Google Maps. I'm happy I did though, because it's definitely interesting.  What I really liked was the different sizes for *everything*. Everything can be ordered small, medium, or large. They also put the calories next to everything.  I went with the Small Original, which was not the best but definitely not the worst. If there was one near UNLV I would definitely pop in quite often, especially with the range of sandwiches and breads as well as the menu selections for pizzas, pastas, and soups.  If I do return I'm not going to grab chips, though, because they are salted way too much. I'm a man of spice but the salt on my salt and vinegar chips were legitimately burning my mouth in a way I didn't anticipate nor find pleasant. The soda selection does include IBC sodas, so I think that makes up for the chips! (Any place that exceeds the normal fountain drinks make me happy.)  The staff is friendly, the inside is clean. There's a drive thru. What more can you ask for? It's pretty nice. I'd like more of these around Vegas, please!"}
{"text":"Good bun. cheap meat. uninspired mumbling service."}
{"text":"The turkey on sourdough is my staple when I eat here, it is delicious. The prices are high though. And not trying to be rude, but the man (I'm assuming manager) on dayshift is a little creepy. He takes orders, too. Otherwise, great sandwiches."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure whenever I am in Vegas. This is an old time favorite for me and have been eating these since I was a kid. I like a variety of their sandwich flavors and usually get one with turkey or the original.    I love bread, and can really appreciate the warm chewy texture and their signature bun feels a lot like a sourdough to me. Yum. I honestly am craving one just writing this review.    As delicious as these things are I never find this place to be overly busy anytime I visit--the location feels clean and the food always tastes fresh. My only fus is that I wish they served something on the side besides chips, like seasoned French fries or something...I am envisioning the ones's like they sell at Rally's burger. Oh Yes, what a combo that would be.... ...Anyway, I really don't mind chips as an option and tend to get the sea salt& black pepper , but having the choice to fully pig out with fries would be nice.    Now that I think of it, I haven't been to Vegas in a while..."}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwiches and salad. At work I had many meetings catered and most times something was forgotten. The owner and staff are very pleasant and easy to communicate with. I enjoy getting the large sandwich and saving half for later."}
{"text":"The most scrumptious Sandwich in town. Angela is the best sandwich maker ever in Da whole wide world !!! Had BLT on wheat bun. So yummy noshin'   Angela suggested Jalepeno bun, never thought O' that. She awesome sandwich wizard! Clean n Fun dining experience !! Thank You Angela"}
{"text":"The service is slow, don't come in if you're in a hurry. Overall, I am not happy with this location. I made the mistake of ordering the tacos on the menu, the food was cold an unappealing."}
{"text":"First off, who reviews fast food chains? Not to be that guy, but this place gets my full fledged support, mostly because I want them to expand to a location that is not thirty minutes from my house. The food is always good, been eating these since I was a kid and the quality hasn't diminished in the slightest. I think they put heroin in the bread or something. Plus the staff is incredibly friendly, the manager is a dead ringer for that movie where the Mexican teacher teaches inner city kids calculus but has the voice of Vito Corleone. If that's not a reason to come in, then I don't know what is. 5/5 easy."}
{"text":"So glad I found this location. Since moving here from New Mexico, I was going through some serious deluxe original on jalapeño bread withdrawals.   This place cured me of my symptoms!  That said, this location is on par with every other location I've been to. The place was clean and the workers very friendly. I had two different conversations with two different employees there. Almost like we were friends or something.   The food?  Excellent. The location?  Excellent. The employees?  Excellent.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I hate to give such a low review when the cashier was perfectly nice. But the sandwiches were overpriced and terrible. We both had the Reuben and the pastrami tasted like bland deli meat and the rye bread tasted like white English muffins. There was hardly any meat. I decided to wash down the bad taste with some of their chips and those weren't good either."}
{"text":"Had the original and all I can say was that the sandwich was simple but well put together and everything on there tasted fresh. Good food. Love the sweet tea. Very friendly staff and the establishment is very well kempt. Clean in the restrooms and in the dining area. There is also a very beautiful girl there with dark black hair, very beautiful and very nice. Brightens my day too see her for sure."}
{"text":"Super nice dude up front awesome  sub extra bacon yummy no lines fast service clean and ready"}
{"text":"this place is across the street from where i get my hair done. The sandwiches are ok. I have had better but sometime when you are hungry you have to eat what you can."}
{"text":"The breakfast menu gives the appearance that their food is fresh and substantial. However, the quesadilla I ordered was the exact opposite of fresh and substantial. There was more grease in my quesadilla than there was quesadilla! I feel like I missed some fine print on the menu, because one \"quesadilla\" (grease with a side of cheese and tortilla) actually consisted of 1/2 quesadilla. This was an unfortunate visit."}
{"text":"Kind, yummy, and not pricy..  Do we need more?  We have been there three times and were satisfied with the super large size.  Recommend original classic."}
{"text":"Vendors often ask for a caterer near our office when presenting a lunch & learn to our staff- Schlotzsky's was referred and was a big hit with our staff. Fast delivery service, great set-up lunch presentation - Awesome Good Food.  Thank you Roscoe & Schlotzsky Staff!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here at 11:30am. Lights on inside, people working. Doors closed and no note on the door. Pretty frustrating."}
{"text":"Everytime I come thru this drive thru (even of there ar NO cars ahead of me) its a 10 minute wait or longer. Today when I came thru the gal said \"Thank you for visiting Schlotzkys it will be a fee minutes\" I then replied \"a few minutes?\" And she said \"yes, a few minutes before I can take your order\". Wow!!!! Im done visiting this place...theres always an excuse...short staffed, extremely busy....blah blah blah! Get it together! I cant even back out or I would and Ive been in line for 10 minutes and 2 cars ahead this time. Pulled in at 11:31...its 11:41! What happened to \"drive thru?\""}
{"text":"I've been to a few Schlotzky's around the valley and this one is actually surprisingly one of the nicer ones.  It's clean with plenty of space for even the largest working group lunch.  Service comes quick, and they have this southwestern sandwich that is great!  If you're one of the many people who work for a large company on the Dunlap corporate freeway, this is not a bad place to grab a bite before the second half of your work day.  One quick tip - it's kind of tough to find, but it's a stone's throw north of Dunlap on the frontage rd.  You have to go back and around a building to find it though."}
{"text":"One star is being courteous. Repeated my order in the drive thru 3 separate times with him repeating me each time. I ordered a turkey sandwich meal with chips and diet coke no ice. Needless to say... I gotta turkey sandwich or so I hope with a soda with ice. Waited in the drive thru lane for 5 mins and no one answered, came into the restaurant and no one even cared. I will not returning to this location as they should be training better etiquette to customers."}
{"text":"I went to the location off of the I17 and Dunlap in Phoenix. I had ordered an original sandwich because I received a promo code for a buy one get one free. Since I was at work I went ahead and ordered online for my convenience and I put the promo code in the instructions. All of the employees gathered around and we're being very rude saying they weren't going to honor the promo code because they didn't enter it when they saw the order. They were rude and unhelpful including the managers there. It was very unprofessional and embarrassing. They offered me no type of customer service. Keep in mind I am a regular and go very often since I work right up the street. I feel disrespected and at this point all I want is my money back. Oh and one more thing, they put sauce in the sandwich that i had specifically said not to on the instructions as I am allergic. This environment is ridiculous and not to mention the guy infront of me was being treated poorly as well. The corporate office needs to work on their customer service at I17 & dunlap. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Great sandwich's. The new owners have really made this place work the way it should. Everyone is very friendly. Service is quick and the food is great. I'm a regular, once again. I believe this is a locally owned franchise. Support the little guy and get in here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is literally the slowest drive through I've experienced. I'm in line as writing this and I've been here for 22 minutes now. Don't come here!!"}
{"text":"Have to say VERY disappointed with drive up service. Order came with missing sandwich and have been battling with corporate office to get a refund for what I paid for and did not get. Paid cash and receipt is non legible so there claim is they can't refund me with out proof of purchase. Wow...really, you would think they would not stoop to this level of POOR customer service. They have lost my business and will be losing a lot more than just this. Big mistake"}
{"text":"I have to admit, the only thing that makes this place good is their interesting looking bread, which is unique in appearance and texture and is delicious. Other than that, the sandwiches are pretty plain and expensive for what you get ($5-6 for a small sandwich).   The service here is pretty lackluster, since there are only a couple people working at any given time. When I've been here, I've found the cashier to be a little impatient when customers are trying to figure out what to order, so now I tend to just hit the drive thru.   The building is super old and parking is tight since there aren't very many spots out front. There's another small parking area in the back but it's not much larger. I usually get the small original, which is good, but like I said...only because the bread is unique, fresh and tasty. If they used baugettes or \"normal\" sub bread for their sandwiches, I don't think I would eat here."}
{"text":"Schlotzsky's is extremely overpriced. When I asked for a combo, the employee told me \"Everything is separate.\" As a result, I paid for:  $6 sandwich $2 chips (1.5 oz) $2 medium drunk $2 mini cinnabon (tiny)   The bacon on the turkey club was undercooked. It's just that when I get mediocre food with small portions, I expect to pay less."}
{"text":"My husband and I just stopped at this location and not only did we receive tasty, hot food but amazing service! Brittany greeted us warmly and went above and beyond to give us a great experience. She is a perfect example of what excellent customer service should look like. Thank you Brittany! Keep up the good work! Also, when it comes to food we had the French dip and the beef smoke cheesy (or something like that) and I would highly recommend both! All in all, a great meal! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"These are quality sandwiches that are really tasty and have a great flavor to it. I have had several different sandwiches at Schlotzsky's and you can not go wrong with any of them. The pizza is very good too and they have a decent selection of fountain drinks. If you are in the area I would highly recommend them. Even if you are not in the area this place is worth the drive if you are traveling to the Las Vegas area or if you live there. Anyways try for yourself and see just how good Schlotzky's is. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Something about the original Schlotzsky's.  I think it is the sourdough bread.  They don't try to biggie size the meat or anything else.  It seems to be a perfect combination of ingredients to stock in my mind as my only fast food solution when I'm in a pinch for time."}
{"text":"I've been here 100 times and do not have a single complaint.  Excellent food, always presented well and top notch service.  Clean, well managed, friendly,  low prices and great selection of food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. We have not been for awhile but used to like this place. They no longer do a combo, sandwich, chips and drink! So we just had a sandwich, $14.00 dollars later, we had a pastrami sandwich with one little piece of sliced meat, Swiss cheese I could not even see , with a sliver of a pickle! We did not even have a drink ! We walked out still hungry and felt like we had been ripped off. I can think of many more places we could have went, so guess what, we left, never to return again!"}
{"text":"Had the large Angus beef and cheese, was pleasantly shocked at the size of it, I've got a big appetite and it was filling for even me.  Outstanding customer service, mind numbing sandwich. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a good deli sandwich. I've tried them all but this place is always pretty solid with quality and consistency. They also bake cinnamon rolls in the restaurant so it always smells good inside. Sometimes all the tables won't be cleaned and or the bathrooms cleaned so I have to deduct a star for that. But overall very solid!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Ordered 2 center Cinnabon rolls. Very Small and almost no icing on them. I got them from where I used to live and they were bigger and loads of icing. Again disappointing. Service was also kinda slow."}
{"text":"Condescension is never, ever a good or acceptable customer service policy. Ever. Hey, Andy Dick lookin' pimply bastard - you didn't get the clue when I tossed it right back atcha there when I entered your sad, \"we're just kind of hanging on and paying to keep the lights on\" store, \"buddy\"??? Your Hispanic co-worker gal is nice. She gets 4 stars.  But people like you who cockily and irritatingly regard every person who comes in the door of your pathetic life as a Schlotsky's schmuck with nothing but mindless contempt shouldn't be anywhere near the front lines of ANY business. Jerks like you are a big reason why people stop going out to eat - you belong out back scrubbing or mopping something - only. The fact that you had to get in that last little desperate, passive-aggressively hostile and poison-to-a-healthy-customer-vendor-relationship - \"buddy\" sealed your doom as a one star loser.  I'm heading down the street to the newly-opened Paradise Bakery next time I'm in your obnoxious vicinity, guy.   Oh, and your food is overpriced for what it is.  Manager, please take note!"}
{"text":"so everyone was talking about these carvel cakes and asking about locations. I always drive by this schlotzkys and see the little carvel sign. I had a bad experience with the beyond disgusting carvel cakes from the grocery store and pretty much decided that it was just a nasty, poor quality product.   well, i got over myself and decided to try it, and oh man it was good!!! it was thicker than frozen yogurt but not as solid as ice cream and the flavors were rich. I had the small swirl in the waffle cone and it was huge! the waffle cone was not as good as cold stone but it was sweet and crunchy and still totally delicious. i am totally a fan. i will just have to stay away from the gross grocery store cakes.   try it!  and as far as schlotzkys? i like the original w no mustard and their pizzas."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. A bunch of kids with no respect work here. I ordered a tuna sandwich. The worst tuna and bread. Please don't waste your money"}
{"text":"I've been here three times recently and have always had great sandwiches and friendly service, and the place is light and open with large windows.  I started using the lotz app and have had three offers come in already (one was for my birthday).  I'll keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Came in late and they let us stay and eat after closing. Never bothered us at all.  Great sandwiches and chips.  Def coming back."}
{"text":"First time at Schlotzsky's, not too bad!  Service could've been better, for sure. My order taker/cashier didn't know how to run the register, which is bad during the lunch rush. He had to call for help, even tho I ordered a standard item off the menu.   I got the Bacon Beefy Smoky Cheesy sandwich and a drink. Nothing too tough, right? Took about 8 minutes to input it-I nearly walked out.   Glad I didn't tho cuz the BBSC is tasty!  Very juicy roast beef and bacon on your choice of bun with smoked cheddar cheese and chipotle mayo. I got the jalapeño cheddar bun.   I will try it again when I have more time and patience."}
{"text":"We've had Schlotzsky's a handful of times & although the wait is a bit longer than I'd like, I can appreciate the fact that the food is made fresh--which truth be told, is exactly what should be expected out of an establishment & none of that pre-heated (or even RE-heated) crap some places serve! ...SO...if you're HANGRY; you've been warned. (worth the wait)  I guess we've been lucky to find seating when we've come because my husband claims the place can sometimes get packed during lunch rush-hour from Luke AFB. HOWEVER, this afternoon I was pleased to find out that you can order ahead if you download their app:   lotz4me  PS. I HAVEN'T USED THE APP, SO DON'T COME FOR ME! but it is a nice way to \"order ON-line so you don't have to wait IN-line!\" lol. (oh, I crack myself up!)   They offer a nice mixture of tables, booths & outdoor seating under a shaded canopy!  I personally LOOOOOOVE the broccoli cheddar soup, but I'm gangsta like that. My picky kiddos really enjoy their individual pizza!"}
{"text":"First time here. 11:30 on a Tuesday morning and it's only 1/4 full. Where is everyone? Sat by the drive thru window and that line was busy and crawling. Too bad. Maybe that's where everyone is? Ordered the Angus beef and cheese on jalapeño cheddar bread. It arrived in 7 mins. Bread was fresh (toasted), produce crisp and the meat was heated-all good. Not as much meat as, say, Port of Subs. Tasted good tho. Good table side hot sauce. Gave it a nice kick. Good touch guys.  I recommend the beef and cheese sandwich. It was tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Gluten makes me sick, so it's hard to find a sandwich place where I can eat the bread. Schlotzsky's has gluten free buns and they're good! I've been here a couple times now when I'm on that side of town. I like the original sandwich the best so far."}
{"text":"I use to come here when I worked nearby.   Schlotzski's wasn't my favorite place for lunch, but it was so much better than the fast food options nearby. I mean, how much Taco Bell can one eat, right?  LOL  So we decided to take a chance before grocery shopping and we're glad we did. As we finished our meal, we looked at each other and said almost in unison, \"well it's a lot better than the last time we were here.\"  If UR familiar with Schlotzsky's, it is a Austin, TX (photo) take on east coast deli. Is it like Katz's or Carnegie or 2nd Avenue, heck no!  But they do serve Tom Carvel ice cream and Cinnabon. LOL. If UR from FL, think a deli version of Miami Subs.   We've enjoyed the Roast Beef, Pastrami, BLT and a some of the other sandwiches. All were good, just don't think NYC deli and you'll do just fine. Expect to pay $8 to $12.   So Three Stars, A-Okay."}
{"text":"This place is underrated! its so good! The whole menu provides variety and does everything well. To name a few the chicken slices in the salad are fresh and perfect! All places should do this chicken in their salads. The breakfast burritos are TOASTED so amazing ! Great pizza too!"}
{"text":"I stopped in this location while out running errands for lunch. First, can we please talk about the number of flies flying around inside the restaurant . The service was okay & the food left much to be desired, I had a turkey bacon club and I've definitely had better else where. This was my first & last time patronizing this food chain."}
{"text":"It took me a while to decide what salad I wanted, either the avocado turkey or the kale grilled chicken. I decided to get the avocado turkey salad because I wanted avocados badly. I get home and there's NO avocados! Very dissatisfied and not only that it took forever in the drive through to make our food!!!"}
{"text":"The girl with eyeglasses need to learn at least to greet. She's rushing people to order. Will not visit this restaurant again. They should hire more people or schedule more people when it's busy"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  My kids love the pizza and soda fountain with the numerous options."}
{"text":"The front counter girls were great, the manager is not so great under pressure. I went in to pick up a fax order that I could not confirm because they were not answering their phones. 10 orders = 30 minutes give or take even though I faxed it in 20+ minutes prior.  The worst part, I got a LECTURE from the manager (perhaps owner?).    The food wasn't super, the bread isn't what it used to be and I will be sure to visit any other location but this in the future."}
{"text":"The food is usually always good. The counter staff is slow and not very personable. If there is a line to order, you will probably be there for a while. I did get food poisoning about 3 weeks ago, I called to let management know and never got a call back or anything!"}
{"text":"Decent sandwiches. A bit pricey for the amount of food you get with the combo. Nothing to write home about but I'm not opposed to going again."}
{"text":"I work on this side of town and this is my first visit to this location. It was the usual lunch rush so it was fairly busy but nothing that should have been unmanageable, but it appeared quite overwhelming to the staff. The person who took my order was barely intelligible as she didn't speak much more than a mumble. She was distracted by customers attempting to pick up their food but the number the kitchen called out didn't match the receipt or the number they were handed (this happened to me as well). She clearly didn't want to be there and neither did the man working in the kitchen. The only person moving with purpose or possessed a friendly demeanor was the manager who was rushing about as if he were herding cats. My suggestion, get new staff."}
{"text":"Schlotzky's is interesting because everything about it talks about the sandwiches and being a sandwich place, and I've had the sandwiches a few times and they are certainly unique, they have a unique spongey kind of bread at Schlotzsky's, but my favorite item has always been their secret star, the pizza. Call it my personal preference but the pizza here and at Rosati's are probably the two best I've ever had, and they have pretty good cookies here too.   Schlotzskys is definitely one of the more underrated chains, the location doesn't really help much but it's still definitely worth a try, especially if you want to try a new pizza."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. I ate here once about a year ago and today I was reminded why I haven't been back since. I paid $7 and change for a grilled cheese that took 15 minutes to make. It was basically a McDonald's cheeseburger without the beef patty. Sprouts is close by and you can got a sandwich loaded with Boars Head meat & cheese for $6."}
{"text":"Tough to get a sandwich wrong on that amazing bread!   This location is in a terrible plaza, and ironically they seem to embrace the \"looks good enough....I guess\" approach to signage. Tough to tell if they are open or not until you grab the door handle.   My only lofty complaint is that they use an iPad for processing credit cards. The same system as street fair vendors and fly-by-night service folk. How on the earth does a chain sandwich shop with a brick and mortar location not have a card processing machine?!? It just feels dirty and wrong to watch my card get swiped to an iPad.   Anyways, GOOD bread!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service- waited 20 minutes for our flatbread order and then it was incorrect.  When I brought it to the front stating it was the incorrect flatbread order, the server stated \"you don't want it?\" I stated it was incorrect and they said they needed to see the receipt because that is what i ordered.  Once I showed them the receipt that had the correct item on it, they said, \"oh, I guess we will have to remake one for you.\"    Won't frequent this place again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Excellent service. Clean bathrooms. Been here several times and never had an issue."}
{"text":"I have been to this location once and I loved it. People are very friendly. The food is delicious. My favorite is the bbq chicken pizza and their broccoli soup."}
{"text":"I love their food, but hate their location!  Get out of this dump and double your business.  Keep Carla in the kitchen.  She has no customer skills whatsoever."}
{"text":"It's gross in here...cobwebs hanging off the lamps and tables r filthy..and how does a sandwich spot run out of wheat bread..and very wierd tht there r pictures of wierd looking kids everywhere..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places of all time!! I always have the original  and I have never been disappointed!! The mixture of the lettuce tomato cheese black olives ham Genoa and cotton salami with there signature dressing OMG perfect texture and flavor. I CRAVE this sandwich. Customer service at this location was good also!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Schlotzsky's for a while now. The soups are delicious and the flatbread is amazing! I have not tried their sandwiches though. Also they have a Cinnabon, which is great for dessert. I always get their Pick 2 Deal."}
{"text":"What is up with people who like Schlotzky's Deli? My family thinks it's good. That when you put their pizza or sandwich in your mouth, the experience is enjoyable. They are wrong. It's as far from enjoyable as I am from traditional. And even though they are wrong, it's all fine and good... except for those rare occasions when I don't have the choice about whether I am also forced to eat there, like birthdays. I don't want to throw my mom under the bus, because I can't even fathom what this says about her to the unknowing reader, but for her last b-day she wanted Schlotzsky's. I know. I know.   It's just so bad. What do you like? The sandwichs? That ridiculous bread? 30,000 cucumber slices? The pizza is so banal I can't even comprehend... Everyone likes artichoke hearts but it can't just be that on a veggie pizza. You must also include flavor.   But people like it! I do not get it on any level. I want to... I just don't.   I actively dislike writing bad reviews."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite fast food restaurant. The place is super clean and the attentiveness of the workers is evident. The owner is there often and does a great job as well with his customers. I have never had a bad meal here - service and food quality  are consistently outstanding. Ingredients are always fresh and the bread is great! Also they offer some excellent meatless sandwiches and flatbreads for vegetarians. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this place since it opened and tried few times. Didn't like the food and prices in past. So after 15 yrs I was there with family after movie...not my choice. Get there, prices are ridiculous! 5.99 for there smallest original, sandwiches up to 12 plus dollars? Ok get food, sandwich was ok, tea was good....but really, my table was sticky, not from not being wiped off but from never being cleaned. The tables, chairs, high chairs everything had a look of a clear coat of filth! Disgusting eat in  area..never again!"}
{"text":"I was passing by and decided to give this place a try. It was actually pretty good as far as a \"fast food\" place go. The staff was friendly and my cashier was definitely helpful. The place was definitely clean which was a surprise for a fast food place. I also received my food quickly and I ordered quite a bit of food (3 sandwich and a pizza). I tried a little of each and it was all good in my opinion. one of the sandwiches was kinda bland but it was no fault on their part it's was to be expected it almost nothing in it. The Albuquerque Turkey sandwich and the chicken pesto pizza were my two favorite out of all of the things I tried, the desserts options were definitely yummy. over all I did not find anything to my disliking so that's a big plus so I'll definitely be returning if I'm in the area and I would recommend this place. Oh and they also have outdoor seating and a drive through!"}
{"text":"I wish there were more Schlotzsky's in the area.  I had a \"Pick Any Two\" Kale & Chicken Salad and Broccoli Cheddar Soup... but I didn't get the chicken in my salad.  :(  Then my husband's BBQ Chicken Pizza was loaded with onions even though he asked to not include them.  Other than that, the cashier was very polite.  He took our order correctly.  I think the error happened on the back.  Place was pretty empty."}
{"text":"From 8/30/16 Stopped in for some lunch. Schlotzkys is a cute little place with a good selection of sandwiches and other yummy foods. I was happy with my food and service and will have to go here again."}
{"text":"Food does not taste good... has a plastic aftertaste, overpriced."}
{"text":"The Angus sandwich was really good. Fresh, hot and made to order. The front counter woman was pleasant, so was the manager. I look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Dirty dirty dirty...even the bathroom was dirty with no soap, where do employees wash after bathroom breaks? I love Shlotsky's, but not this location"}
{"text":"Had the turkey original it was great! I recommend this location but other locations are not always the same. The staff was very friendly and I love the sweet tea!"}
{"text":"Bad bad bad! I love other schlotzsky's but stay away from this location. After ordering our sandwiches we were told they were out if tomatoes (a sandwich shop out of tomatoes really?) then waited in the drive thru and they got the meat wrong for the sandwich so even a longer wait... Got home sandwich was dry and not worth it. Epic fail for the second time at this location, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Schlotzsky's for roughly 15 years on and off. I enjoy the sandwiches they offer and like the pizza too once in a while. Its different from most sandwich places and i really like the sourdough bread they use. Haven't had a bad experience there ever and even though it might be a little pricey the food is still good."}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed!! We order once a week and always try to give it another shot. Today was the last straw. They are so busy, they never get an order right, or you wait 1/2 HR for it. This time no salad dressings was give to us for our pickup, and the pasta was cold. I know that they're not making the pasta dishes, but they should at least heat them up!!"}
{"text":"I loved their Ham sandwich and their pepper chips rock. But then I found out the ham sandwich with a thick cut of ham was only a limited time sandwich so its no longer available. What a bummer. I was going to start making this my regular lunch time pickup place. Maybe they'll decide to make limited sandwiches more permanent."}
{"text":"**update** so after I wrote the the previous review someone sent me a message asking me to send my mailing address so they could send me a coupon to apologize and try again.  Well, it's been quite awhile and even though I sent my info right away I have not heard anything nor received anything from Corporate.   Very disappointed!!!  Not just about the coupon either,  Like if you weren't going to send me anything that would have been fine with just an apology but it's because they offered and never followed up. ----------  The cooks didn't inform the order takers they were out of gluten free buns so I ordered and paid and then was told after the fact.  So they put it on a tortilla but still charged the same amount. The manager never even came to apologize or anything."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes to get my order taken. There was no line and very few people in lobby. Ordered and received my food after no less than 20 minutes and immediately noticed there was a hair in my sandwich. No problem though, I told them about it and waited 30 minutes only to find out that they forgot to make it. I got my money back no problem and will never return."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the food is usually good, though tonight one item isn't up to the usual standard.  I check my orders because often there is something missing. Today, three things were wrong or missing. One I noticed immediately, one after I'd left the restaurant, and one after arriving home.   I'll stop by again--eventually--and if they ever start getting the orders right, maybe I'll bump my rating up a notch.  Update: Went back recently and food was fine--though again, I had to ask for missing items."}
{"text":"Stopped in while waiting for an oil change. Short wait and very curteous staff. They brought me napkins with my Club on a nice plate.  Just a tad pricier than something like Subway, but better quality."}
{"text":"If I could drop a zero-spot here, I would.  This.place.is.awful. I had never been to one before now, and I absolutely will not go back.  For those who enjoy three times the amount of mayonnaise as meat in a sando, this is the place for you. Assembly line sandwich at it's worst."}
{"text":"I've lived in Mesa my whole 26 years of life, and had yet to try this place. I consider myself somewhat of a sub connoisseur since I worked at Ned's when I was 15, but I digress. I stepped inside and was quickly transported back to the 1990's: I mean this place hasn't been updated in years I tell you! I pushed past the cringe-worthy green countertops and was met with a smile from the girl behind he register. I ordered the small smoked turkey on wheat and my first bite was... blasé. Then I quickly realized it's because it doesn't come with cheese! What sandwich doesn't automatically come with cheese? (This is a rhetorical question, obviously the BLT is one.) I then ripped open their regular potato chips hoping to add a pop of pizazz to my palate. Sadly, it was met with more blandness. I mean, I get that they're regular potato chips but in a world chalk full of flavors you have to up your game a bit if you want to set yourself apart... or repeat customers at least! I so badly wanted to like this place, I root for any business in Mesa to succeed but I can't say I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"We used to make special trips to the Schlotzsky's in Atlanta, which was like 45 minutes from where we lived.  So, when we moved to Carson City, we were in Schlotzsky's withdrawal.  Now that we are here in LV, we are thrilled to have one nearby!    So far, this location is as good as any that we've been to in the past. Service has been friendly and quick, and the sandwiches have been consistent with my expectations.  My favorite part about a Schlotzsky's sandwich is the sourdough bread and the olive tapenade that comes on the Original (it might come on other ones too, but I pretty much always order the Original).  Besides the sandwiches, I also really love their cracked pepper potato chips, while my fella' swears by the jalapeno chips.  In fact, this is the only place we know of where he can get non-kettle style jalapeno flavored chips.    We will no doubt be back again and again."}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed. I've had better sandwiches at subway and that's a lot cheaper. The two stars are for the service or else I wouldn't give any. The sandwiches look a lot better than they really are. And I'm a huge foodie if you take a look @ my reviews. I wouldn't come back..."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Schlotzsky's today so went.  Jentyl was the cashier and was super friendly and was able to offer suggestions which I ended up getting for the hubby, I always get get the original on sourdough.  They got new the new drink machine that makes an exorbitant amount of combinations. The cinnabon looked okay and I was going to get one but they didn't look $3.49 appetizing.   And the  one thing I absolutely hate about this place...the smell when you walk in.  It always smells like the sewer backed up when you first enter, have never been in the bathroom."}
{"text":"i never really crave places like Panera, Jason's Deli, and McAlister's but they're always really good. Schlotzsky's Deli was no different. This is the closest Schlotzsky's to Charlotte if you need your fix. This location felt like a brand new store based on its cleanliness and the staff was friendly and patient as i struggled deciding what to order. Yes there is a coupon in the Entertainment book 2011 for a couple dollars off.   i forgot the name of what i ended up ordering but it was the spiciest sounding thing on the menu. Definitely left satisfied."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. Came here this morning with my brother and girlfriend ( we were the only 3 people in the building). It took them 30 minutes to make 3 breakfast sandwiches (all of which were the same thing). And they managed to mess it up. Now I understand mistakes happen as I work in the restaurant industry. However, when you have 1 ticket and manage to drop the ball and take 30 minutes to make it, that is unexcusable. We then got the food and it was awful. Don't waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty yum. Been there twice now and everything was good. Their bread- omfg. We even sat there on the patio chatting for two hours  and no one bothered us! Next time will have to get a Cinnabon too!"}
{"text":"Poor service, we walked up to the counter and Ashton was working. My wife asked for an original and he proceeded to argue with her about the bun. She just wanted the original. She asked for no tomatoes or onions as she has an allergy. We went to the window to grab or food and noticed a female employee playfully hitting Ashton in the face with aluminum foil. Sure enough they put the warm turkey in it and it was mine. They called my name and I asked for hot sauce. She rolled her eyes and handed over some. Went to open our food  and sure enough tomato and onions. Took it to the counter and all they did was take them out and hand it back. We the out food away and left. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Okay I need to break this review up into two separate sections section one will be for the food in section 2 will be for the physical establishment.  When I go in there, I know that Schlotzsky's probably isn't the best food choice for me health wise, but it sure is tasty as hell! Bread, coupled with lettuce turkey tomato mayonnaise cheese all warmed up wrapped so nicely makes for an awesome lunch. And of course I end up getting a bag of salt n vinegar chips which is just awful for me.  But tasty, none the less.  My issue with the physical building is this - the drink station is worn down and pretty much disgusting. The lemons that they had set out for the ice tea, although they were covered with aplastic lid, it was like a fruit fly colony in there. I mean there was a swarm of fruit flies all over the lemons. Also were the brewer for the iced tea is is on a piece of what appears to be three quarter inch MDF board that the laminate was peeling off of it, the exposed wood had soaked up the fluid around it, and swelled, thereby not allowing anybody to properly clean and sanitize the drink station. It appears that although they do a good job with cleaning what they have, some attention needs to be paid back into the brick and mortar portion of the business as it needs some TLC and some repairs. If you have a look at all of the chairs they are pretty badly chewed up with peeling paint and not in good repair at all. And as much as I appreciate them having to mid 90s Apple computers there for us to check your email, it's probably time to get rid of those things."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service I had the Tuscan on cibata sandwich and the Margarita flat bread they were so good I would and will recommend them to anyone"}
{"text":"This location caters to drive-thru. Came in to dine-in and they served 12 vehicles while we waited for 2 kids meal and 1 half sandwich. Ended up having to go back up and tell them we needed to change it to go. Spent 20 minutes inside just to come out with a bag of food to eat in the car."}
{"text":"Very slow service. There was only one person in front of me at the drive thru and they literally took 15 mins to get the food out. I ordered off the menu so nothing custom that should have taken that long. Also it has a Cinnabon attached so I assumed they would have iced coffee like the Cinnabon does however they do not. I was disappointed to hear that they will only serve hot coffee."}
{"text":"Went in with my family, excited to try Schlotzskys after not having it since a trip to Chicago.  Stood at the counter only to be ignored by not one but two employees.  Won't be back to this place ever.  They knew they were ignoring us, because they kept looking over and talking to each other.  What a sad place."}
{"text":"My first time at this location.  I had the lunch special; small Ham and Cheese, chips and soda for $6.00.  I chose the Jalapeno cheese bread because I enjoy a bit of heat and the order was quickly prepared.  The bread, meat and cheese had been heated and that really made this sandwich tasty.  There were veggies and not too much mayo or mustard, just enough for an accent to the taste.  I really enjoyed it and noticed this place was popular with the lunch crowd...for good reason.  The help was vey informative when I hesitated choosing a sandwich, answered several questions showing they knew their item.  For the great value pricing, heated sandwich, and quick preparation I go against the other Yelper's votes and recommend it for a fast lunch.  Its not gourmet by any means but it doesn't pretend to be."}
{"text":"It's our first time here and the cashier of this place needs to be re-trained. Not even a smile, welcome or thank you! She was so rude didn't even bother to get her name because it's not even worth knowing. I'm sorry Carlos you did awesome with customer service, thank you for making our first visit very welcoming all four stars are for your awesomeness!"}
{"text":"I have loved Schlotsky's since first discovering them in Bloomington, Illinois. This particular location in Tempe being connected to a Cinnabon is like a wonderful mix of greatness. A little sweet with your sourdough. :) For a chain restaurant, they are unique and my top choice when really craving a deli sandwich. (Which currently being pregnant, I have craved quite regularly!!!) Subway, Jimmy John's and Quizno's all take a backseat to Schlotsky's, in my humble opinion. I just wish there were more of them. Haven't found any where I live now in Washington, so it was a must to hit up this Schlotsky's while in Tempe on business. Today was my second visit in a week and likely not my last as I'm still here another week. Original and Smoked Turkey Breast, both on sourdough, are my go-to's and never disappointed. Also, both visits in Tempe were made through drive thru - service was very fast, friendly, and my order was exactly as I expected."}
{"text":"I havnt been to schlotskys in a while and I have certainly missed out. Tasty food with fresh ingredients was to be expected of,but they have truly evolved as a deli and should be called Super Schlotskys. I ordered a chipotle chicken on flatbread that was as quik as fast food and restaurant quality. Before i even made it to the bathroom Jyntel saw me walk past and brought the key to me without me having to ask for it. She made sure that she greeted us and bid us farewell while she was helping other customers.Her friendly demeanor and allstar service are just a few reasons why I'll go back and and try some more of their new menu choices."}
{"text":"Well.... I remember this deli to be pretty badass when I was younger. Now... I got excited when I saw one on my map while on the way out of Phoenix. The menu board in the drive through looked awesome, and starving, I ordered two sandwiches for the drive back to Cali. Along with a large iced tea, the tab was over $20 bucks. A lot for a sandwich shop, considering you can get some pretty big, insanely delicious sandwiches in SoCal for less than this total. Pulled up to the window to pay, and had to question if this was the right window? It was almost higher than the roof of my car, and about three feet from the curbing. I had to get out and stand up to hand them payment. Fortunately I could open my door all the way up with the excessive room here. It took about 35 minutes to receive my lunch bag, while impatiently waiting in 104' heat. Mind you this was two \"boutique\" sandwiches, and I could see in the window, there was one table eating inside. I pulled the sandwiches out of the bag, and to my dismay, there certainly wasn't $18 worth of ingredients in them. The bread was stale, and that's all it really was... I wasn't in the mood to argue with a couple of Jr. High dropouts over the volume of ingredients in their \"masterpieces\", so off I went. Destined to tell the world what a sh!tty job Schlongsky's Deli in Goodyear, AZ did on my sandwiches. By the other reviews, i'm not the only unsatisfied customer here. Hopefully they use their undeserved riches to educate and train their staff a bit better. F."}
{"text":"I love their GF bun! I always get the Turkey Bacon club and have never been disappointed with my meal. I've never felt sick from any gluten contamination either! This is definitely my new favorite lunch spot, just wish there was one closer to home."}
{"text":"New potato chips are DISGUSTING. !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 220mg of sodium per bag.. taste like your literally eating salt packets!!! Uuuuuuggggghhhhhhhhh!!!   I couldn't eat them I had to trade them in for baked regular"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has lower ratings because when I went I liked it a lot!! Granted, all I got was a breakfast sandwich on whole wheat bread, but it was delicious...one of the best ones I've had. We stopped here on the way to a show to get a fast, filling meal. The sandwich was bigger than I expected...twice the size of Starbucks' breakfast sandwich. It's in the food court so there's lots of seating!"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is SOLID.  If you're looking for a unique spot to grab lunch on this side of town this is it, the sourdough bread is unlike any other And it's KILLER. What ever they're doing DONT STOP.   If you download their app you'll receive a FREE small The Original sandwich. (Not pictured)  I opted for the Veggie. It really hit the spot. (See photo)"}
{"text":"Definitely the most underrated sandwich in Las Vegas.  The bread is insanely good and the toppings are generous.  Very clean restaurant inside and the staff from cashier to sandwich makers are friendly.  Join the sandwich club and get a free one on your bday."}
{"text":"Great service! Delivered to our office and everyone loved their original sandwich! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The lines were always on my nerves but McDonalds next door was even worse. They just done have enough space to have as many employees as they should. Not sure I would go here again. But maybe"}
{"text":"I met an associate here at this location for a light snack. (his suggestion)  Schlotzsky's Deli is typical of order up at the counter or call in and pick up your food place.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and the setting is somewhat busy in appearance.  The kind of place to pick up something to bite on quick and get moving.  Location is very central to Phoenix Proper  and while you are there ordering or snacking, there are several internet stations set up to go onto the World Wide Web if that is your desire.  I didn't care much for what I had ordered (Toasted---Turkey & Guacamole Smoked turkey breast and guacamole with red onion, lettuce and tomato on toasted Wheat bread. Contains milk, soybeans and wheat.)  I guess I just don't care for toasted sandwiches(personal preference---same feeling about any Quiznos sandwiches!)  This was my first visit to this deli...I'm pretty sure it will be my last, I found the place boring.  I give it one star for location, one for the internet access, and one for outdoor seating.---The rest?---Well, you fill in the blanks!"}
{"text":"Schlotsky's is a refreshingly original take on the sandwich. Unlike most of the other sandwich shops (Subway, Quiznos), Schlotsky's is both more delicious and much more expensive. It is also completely different. I recommend the Turkey & Guac."}
{"text":"Best sandwich hands down! I like how they renovated it. Spacious and clean. Definitely worth the trip from Fountain hills. Great location"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm very picky when it comes to corned beef & Pastrami. I practically grew up in Jewish Deli's. The Pastrami is not like good cured Pastrami that you find in Jewish Deli's. It's ok in my opinion. The Dark Rye is very soft unlike a good rye. Not my kind of Deli. But it might be someone's Deli"}
{"text":"I had only been to one other Sclotzsky's before visiting this one, and that was several years ago. After my second visit, I now remember why it had been so long since the first.  When I walked in, I was surprised by how crowded it was. I mean, the parking lot was pretty much empty. And then I saw it...the reason behind this mystery crowding. As it turns out, this location was undergoing MAJOR renovations when I visited. So, the entirety of the dining room had been condensed into one overcrowded section of seats.  When I took a look at the menu, I was underwhelmed. There just weren't many options to be had. They had a few different combo options, each one for around $9.00. I settled for the black angus on wheat with a medium drink, and I skipped the chips. That last move turned out to be a big mistake.  When my sandwich came, it was a complete disappointment. It looked like I had just paid $9.00 for two pieces of bread, an entire head of lettuce, and two slivers of meat swimming somewhere in between. In the sandwich's defense, the bread WAS really good.  Hopefully now that I've put proverbial pen to paper about this place, I'll remember to save myself a trip the next time the opportunity arises. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person who doesn't appreciate paying good money to leave a restaurant still hungry."}
{"text":"Reliably good.  They offer a nice selection of toasted sandwiches, salads, and wraps.  I didn't notice until last night they have pizza as well.  I tried the grilled chicken and pesto, and it was actually pretty tasty.  I always find the staff at this location to be very nice as well."}
{"text":"I love these guys. Their sandwiches are delicious , their flat breads are amazing , and the owner is very nice and personable. I always get great food and good service when I come here. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The fact that this place is a fast food joint immediately knocks star number one off. So let's start with 4. Places is dirty, awkwardly arranged, and congested. Workers all had miserable expressions,  and frankly I dont blame them. My face would look like that too if I worked here. Since employee satisfaction and service is always big for me, say goodbye to star 3. The food was overpriced dramatically for what you get, and tasted extremely bland and processed. The sandwich is served on this bizarre round bread that tastes like a dish sponge, and to boot it comes out hot, with lettuce and tomato on top that is lukewarm and soggy due to the hot meat. How anyone thought that adding finely chopped, taco style lettuce and tomato to a hot sandwich is well beyond me. Meat portion was weak, bacon was almost drifting into another dimension it was so thin, soggy, and non existant,  and on top of that, the \"chips\" I was given were some kind of pringle texture, potato sawdust knockoff. I didn't know I would also be served the worst chips I have ever eaten alongside one of the most Ill thought out sandwiches I have had the pleasure of digesting. I won't be coming back. Seeing 5 star reviews on this makes me question my faith in humanity. Avoid.  Edit: manager contacted me, and is addressing issues. I'll add one star back for that."}
{"text":"This location just opened. May 24th 2013 was there first day of business.  I hadn't eaten at a Schlotzsky's for many years, so being as I work in the area I was looking forward  to having somewhere new to have lunch at.  I've eaten there twice now since they opened. On both visits they were fast and very friendly. Being they're brand new  you really wouldn't expect less than stellar service.  The food was good and a real change of pace to what has been available around here."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Ordered a basic sandwich was pretty pricey. They forgot to add my drink to my order . After literally 19 minutes I had to walk up to the counter to pick up my food they never brought it out to my table . Noticed they even forgot to include the pickle spear . I understand people have an off day . But the place was literally empty maybe a random car in a drive thru . The staff was not very friendly. The plus was the dining room was clean"}
{"text":"After finding a ton of fibers in my soup I'm to grosses out to eat the rest of my meal! $15.00 wasted!"}
{"text":"Love the salad wraps and every sandwich I've tried is excellent.  They are pricey but it's good and fresh."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in a while.  After tonight, I won't be back.  Food  was ok but the place was filthy dirty! From the drink dispenser to the floor and table tops!  Oh and the trash can was dirty. Yuck! The cashier was lazy and the only person working was the sandwich lady."}
{"text":"Well, a year ago I would have (probably should have) given this place a pretty good review. But tonight, my wife and I decided to go back here for takeout because we hadn't been there in quite a while. Last time, it was a nice experience. This time, the three employees that helped me seemed aloof and slow. I understand when things are busy, but I was the only one at the counter. Another customer came in maybe 5 minutes behind me. The employees weren't exactly rude in a purposeful way. They just didn't seem to care that I was there. And customer service seemed like it wasn't even on their radar.  This place isn't exactly expensive, but I expect average to better than average service for a $10 dollar meal. I'd like to try again, because the food isn't bad. But I won't bother. Next time we'll just go to Chipotle as we originally planned."}
{"text":"Good things start with the bread. The bread for my sandwich was awesome, different and very enjoyable. Now, if there was meat to go along with the bread, I would have been in good shape. There was less meat on here than leaves on a tree in New York in the middle of winter.  I may have caught them on a bad day because the service was slow. I came in because the sign outside said \"Dad's Eat Free\" for Father's Day. So I inquired with the cashier if my children needed to be present. I was told no. So I ordered and got handed the bill. I was very confused with the whole interaction. The only thing that was free was the breath I wasted.   I don't think that the \"A\" team was on today. I may come back and some point and give it another shot. That bread is hard to resist but can't carry the rest... TBC. #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and definitely coming back.  They have delicious sandwiches, good staff ..the only \"bad\" thing was the place very quiet. .no music..but that's all"}
{"text":"This place has the worst food. Especially for what they charge. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad, for $10. Let me tell you this was in no way a $10 salad. For this price, I would expect roasted or grilled chicken. But what I got was rubbery chicken slices - the kind with added water, fillers and preservatives. It was disgusting. I returned the salad, and was offered a replacement. I ordered a turkey sandwich - and yet again - LOW quality, rubbery, tasteless, thin meat. A totally bland half sandwich with a half plain salad for $9.50. No drink in this combo.   This \"deli\" is a ripoff corporate chain who cuts corners and compromises quality. I would not recommend it to anyone.   I do love that they offer Cinnabon tho, so I'll add a star."}
{"text":"Yum!! I have to eat Schlotzsky's whenever I am nearby.  I love their jalapeno bread.  There are so many sandwich and pizza choices...I try something new every time because I know I'm going to love it.  And their homemade spicy-sweet sauce is incredible - I bought a bottle to keep in my fridge."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly staff, and very good food. My only criticism would be that I think there should be a little more meat on the sandwich and  $1.99 for a small soda seems a bit pricey."}
{"text":"So.   It's the pastrami on dark rye.  Henry Weinhardt root beer.   Andrew gave us great service."}
{"text":"Don't order a combo - it's a ripoff.  They advertise a small combo for $6.99 but then add everything up individually for a cost of $7.18.  The manager tried to say corporate changed the price and they didn't change it on the board yet but I doubt that's true."}
{"text":"Fav sandwich is the pastrami and Swiss! The turkey and guacamole is awesome too!! Worth more than just 3 stars !"}
{"text":"I love the Original sandwich here, but I wish they weren't stingy on the toppings. It seems like each time I have a sandwich there is less and less tomatoes, lettuce, black olives, and salami on it!  Today my Original's toppings didnt cover my whole sandwich, so I ate a lot of bread :(  The customer service here is great.  Both the girl taking my order, and the man delivering my food to my table were extremely friendly.  And a pecan chicken cranberry salad was tried...it was good! I wish their parking lot was larger, it is very tiny and full at lunchtime. It's very hard to get out of a parking spot!"}
{"text":"you know, for the location... it was pretty nice. the service was nice and the food what i normally would have gotten and tasted right. the restroom was nice and clean too."}
{"text":"I love my Schlotzsky's. Great place to stop for lunch, awesome sandwiches. Schlotzsky' has been one of my favorite lunch spots since the 80's."}
{"text":"Tried this place since my co-worker always raved about it. Sad to say schlotzsky's is not for me. I had a pick any two combo and chose half of the original sandwich and half of the avocado cobb salad. When I saw that the cobb salad came with shreds of deli turkey meat (the cheap thin kind that doesn't look like real meat), I knew I would not come back haha. The sandwich didn't taste any special either and quite greasy. The pick any two and a small drink cost $11. I can buy a way better tasting lunch at another place for the same price or even cheaper, so I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I dunno why this is listed as a pizza place, I believe Scholtzky's is known more for their sandwiches. They do sell flat bread pizzas though too, along with breakfast sandwiches and chips too.   I got their medium smoked turkey sandwich on sourdough bread and could hardly finish it; it was pretty big. It was also a pretty good sandwich too. I went at a random, unbusy time so my sandwich was freshly made pretty quickly.  Located in Excalibur's upstairs food court, it was nice to find something not dripping with grease like some of the other fast food places around."}
{"text":"Totally screwed up my order after going over it multiple times!!!!  Check your order before you pull away!!!  And people want these morons to make 15.00 per hour!!! PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes of sitting in the drive thru to get my order and I was the only one in line so it obviously wasn't busy. Also, I ordered a chicken, Apple cranberry walnut chicken salad and ended up with no chicken :/ disappointing."}
{"text":"Schlotzsky's is one of my all-time favorite sandwich spots. I have been coming here since they opened 38 years ago. The staff has always been very friendly and knowledgeable in explaining the different sandwiches.  They have a special sourdough bread that I have not seen at any other food Spot. They also have a jalapeno Cheese sourdough,  Dark Rye,  Pretzel Bun, Hearty Grains Tortilla, Udi's Gluten Free Bun.   My favorite sandwich has always been the original Sandwich exta crispy.  It has Lean smoked ham, Genoa and cotto salamis, and melted cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses layered with black olives, red onion, lettuce, tomato, mustard and a signature dressing on a toasted Sourdough bun.  When they first open they had a very minimal menu with just the signature sandwiches and a couple soups and salads now they have extended the menu quite a bit and here it is  These are their classic sandwiches they started off with: The Original, Ham & Cheese Original-Style, Smoked Turkey Breast, Fresh Veggie.  These are the signature sandwiches they have:  Deluxe Original-Style has xtra meat, Turkey Bacon Club, Fiesta Chicken, Turkey Original-Style, Turkey & Guacamole, Angus Roast Beef & Cheese,  These last five are only available at certain locations  Albuquerque Turkey, Angus Pastrami & Swiss on dark rye bread Chipotle Chicken, Pastrami Ruben on dark rye bread Angus Corned Beef Reuben on dark rye bread,   Schlotzsky's is adding seven specialty sandwiches to its menu,  These are the  7 new specialty sandwiches:  Ultimate Grilled Cheese: melted muenster, parmesan, provolone and swiss, layered with smoked bacon strips, avocado and tomatoes served on an oven-baked on a soft pretzel roll and  with Tuscan tomato basil soup for dipping.

Good job Schlotzsky's for keeping it fresh & consistent."}
{"text":"I'm a long time Schlotzsky's fan. Been eating her since I was a kid and I still love it. It's funny because until a few years ago I didn't realize that I much prefer sourdough bread... so that probably explains why I love this place.   My favorite is the turkey, original style but with only turkey (no pork)   Every once and a while I'll get the one with avocado... but honestly the regular sandwich is so good I don't think it needs anything extra. I'm also thrilled that the location by my work carries China Mist Passion Fruit Black Tea (my absolute favorite iced tea) I love it!!! The chip selection leaves a little to be desired, but I'm not coming here for the chips.  Staff at this location is always extremely helpful and patient... I'm usually ordering for several co-workers and don't always have my ducks in a row."}
{"text":"Clean  Friendly Good Great bread  Not cheap  Try the pastrami on orig bread"}
{"text":"My lunch today was delicious!  The spicy chicken is worth every penny!  Jalapeño bread, thin slices of chicken, black olives , and other bits of yumminess!  I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"If you dont mind waiting for 15 minutes for them to make your sandwich ..its worth it. Problem is place is always empty and they take forever ."}
{"text":"It definitely looks more pleasing than your average fast food place. But then again, paying eight to nine dollars for fast food is kind of expensive.  I'm thinking you can get more food at a cheaper price with comparable atmosphere somewhere else. Who knows. Maybe I'm a cheapskate.  AND THEY RAN OUT OF NAPKINS at lunch time. That's a first for a fast food place..."}
{"text":"The place looks nice and the food came out pretty quick. Looking at the menu, the selection is not much and prices looked comparable to places that had better food and selections. It doesn't taste bad and service is ok. If you are looking something convenient, this might be a good place. Although there are only a few locations in the valley so it may not be that convenient after all. lol"}
{"text":"Love!! Love!!! Schlotzsky's the turkey beacon club is delish!! Totally forgot that this little gem was hidden in Gastonia since they closed the stores here in Charlotte  The staff is very sweet and attentive and the portions are right on! I picked up a menu so I can come back with my coworker to pick up lunch."}
{"text":"Think my experience a outlayer? NOT!! read the other reviews. This location has a problem and they do not care...About a month ago was in that part of town and craving a schlotzky's. What a mistake! Ordered the Albuquerque Turkey small. Priced over $6. The sandwich was a joke. Had one slice of turkey wadded up in the middle so it looked like something when they cut it. It had 3 dime sized peppers and some melted cheese. Went online and did customer survey. Customer sevice rep emailed back and told me \"yes I got ripped off\". There should have been 2 ounces of turkey, 1/4 cup of roasted peppers and 3 slices of bacon and cheese. I got jipped with a turkey flavored bread sandwich. She claimed that she would send me a coupon to try again. That was nearly 3 weeks ago and they just flat do not give a flip about customer satisfaction or being honest. Planned deception is what I got so they can make their ends meet since they admit minimum wage is out of control. What a sorry excuse for a restaurant and customer service. DO NOT TRUST THEM OR THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE. BOTH ARE DECEPTIVE AND UNTRUSTWORTHY. Save your money and go else where. This chain is going out of business SOON!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just don't go during lunch. They were slow and behind, the quality suffered. Not horrible but not exactly why you go to Shlotzskys either. Staff was friendly and kept up the best they could."}
{"text":"I came in for the first time today for breakfast. It took a while for my small egg and cheese sandwich. The lady handed it to me with a big smile. When I got to work and took a few bites, it tasted funny. Took a look inside and the whole thing was burnt to a crisp! Disgusting. Never again."}
{"text":"I eat at Schlotskys a couple time a month and I enjoy it. However,  tonight was a very different story. I waited 20 minutes for 3 sandwiches only to get them and find out the order wasn't correct. I received a sandwich I didn't order, didn't get the one I did order and one of the sandwiches was so poorly wrapped that it fell apart in the bsg. I asked to see a manager and that was a worse mistake than waiting 20 minutes for the wrong sandwich. He was rude and to be fair I was rude right back. I asked for a refund and he threw the bag on the counter and told me I could have the food or a refund but he wasn't going to do both because I was being rude. Well things went downhill from there. I asked for the name and number of GM buy just got attitude from the manager. Needless to say, it is sad that such a good sandwich is being made by such incompetent employees. Very bad experience. Polly C."}
{"text":"Just went to Schlotzsky's last night for dinner!  I have also been to this restaurant many times over the past few years and the food has always been great.  They also have the best tomato basil soup I have ever eaten (unfortunately it is only offered occasionally).   The menu changes each season with new items, but the staff is always able to make discontinued items for me when I ask.  I usually get the Bacon, Tomato, and Mushroom pizza or the Greek salad (lots of feta cheese!).  My boyfriend likes to get the large Bacon Beefy Smoke Cheesy!  The large is literally two personal pizza breads made into a bun so this justifies spending 10 dollars on a fast food sandwich!    This restaurant has also had a golden A sanitation rating for as long as I have eaten here.  I don't think there are many golden A restaurants in Gastonia!     The drive through does take longer than a typical fast food joint but the wait is well worth it!    This Schlotzsky's has partnered up with Cinnabon!  There are mini and regular cinnabuns here... although I have never really been a fan of cinnabuns.    Suggestion:  Maybe start serving quesadillas.  You guys already have the tortillas from the wraps and ofcourse you have meat and cheese.  Really the only place to get a fast food quesadilla in Gastonia is Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Too bad things cant be given stars in different categories, because the food itself deserves all 5 stars. I had never been to a Schlotzsky's before, until yesterday. Probably because I don't have one anywhere near me. However, of course when I caught wind they were doing a buy one get one free for national sandwich day I of course was all over it! Luckily this place isn't far from my work, so I headed over about 130 ide say. Later lunch than I normally take, which I thought would work in my favor especially on a sale day. Well, it didn't. Oddly enough there was only 1 person ahead of me in line, but I still ended up waiting 20 MINUTES for my food. Not only that, the cinnabon I ordered was given to me right away, in a bag (since my order was to go), so by the time the food came it was cold! Im sorry, but that is way too long to wait, for a place I thought was semi fast food. The sandwich was amazing, I got the Tuscan one minus the peppers, and the cinnabon was too (duh lol), but the wait kinda killed it for me. While I get an hour lunch, it doesn't mean I want to spend half of it waiting on my food. Mixed opinion, possibly will be back when they have another sale, as I also thought the 8 bucks was costly for a medium sandwich."}
{"text":"Despite Schlotzsky's being a chain it's got the feel of a hole-in-the-wall deli. But maybe that has more to do with the run down building and not-always-clean interior. Regardless, I've been a fan for the past few years. The thing that elevates their sandwiches from 'solid' to good or great is their bread. It's lightly toasted, so the edges are a little crispy, but the rest is soft, chewy and spongey. Definitely unique compared to most other sandwich places in town.   My usual is the ham & cheese, but 'The Original', turkey club, and roast beef sandwiches are all good. Portions are big. The regular size is usually enough for 2 in my opinion."}
{"text":"If I could rate this a 0 I would...I've been coming to this location for years. I have never in my life experienced such a mean and rude staff member here. I don't know if she is a manager or a shift lead but, I want to remind you that not everyone is perfect. I messed up on an order, accidently ordering the wrong size deluxe sandwich. I apologized multiple times knowing how it feels to have to remake something. I worked in the restaurant business for years. But not only did she walk away  Angrily throwing the accidental order away but also the attitude she had and tone of voice towards me was very  distasteful. To say the least me and my family will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Have never had a bad thing here. Their bread is made fresh everyday - literally flour, eggs, milk, etc. Restaurant is clean, service is great. I go with a turkey original and an original pizza almost everytime."}
{"text":"I LOVE Schlotzkys. I was so bummed when they closed the one by Galleria Mall. Good thing is I work fairly close to this location. I absolutely love the original!"}
{"text":"There's nothing special about this \"deli\". I'm not talking about this location, I'm talking about Shlotzsky's as a restaurant. The bread is too thick, tasteless and the meat is sparing, it's not worth the money you spend. There are way too many choices of really good food and Shlotzsky's just doesn't cut it. I'd go to Subway or Capriotti's over this crap."}
{"text":"It's a unique sandwich and one I've always loved. I'd take a schlotsky's over most of the major sub shops anyday."}
{"text":"Great food  Strangely recommend this restaurant ... The bread is fresh and good they also have great cinnamon buns .."}
{"text":"The girl behind the counter was nice.  The Cinnabon was not nearly as good as I expected.  Where was the carmelized sugar crunch and flavor? The yeasty goodness of a fresh cooked roll? The sugary crunch of the glazed icing on top?  All sadly lacking.  It was more like rolled up white bread with Karo syrup and cinnamon over and in it.  It didn't taste horrible.  It just wasn't wonderful, except for the candied pecans.  For the same price I could buy a whole bag of them.  I had a mini Cinnabon a few years ago and it was pretty good, albeit very sweet.  This one wasn't anything I'd go rushing back for.  Three stars for cleanliness, friendliness and the fact that they still serve Carvel ice cream even though it isn't advertised.  If I'd known this I would've been back sooner.  I haven't been here since they changed the sign from Carvel to Cinnabon a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"Waited 19 minutes for a sandwich for lunch.......  Lunch!!!!!  I only have a small time frame available...  I won't be returning for a very long time...."}
{"text":"SUPREME! Great location with super friendly staff and management. Chicken Bacon Smokecheezy is THE truth. The Flat Bread Pizza is also yumm as is everything else hubby has tried on the menu. Thank you for consistently delicious sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I recieved a coupon for a buy one get one coupon for a large pizza. I was excited because I love their BBQ pizza.  We noticed as we arrived that they advertised BOGO pizza on Sunday.  We went and ordered two pizzas ($11.99 each) and presented the email which I received Friday that mentioned \"this weekend only\" BOGO pizza \"through 2/1/2015\".  I read this as valid through Sunday.  Unfortunately I was told only Sunday.  I felt that the coupon would be more clear instead of \"this weekend\" or \"through 2/1/15\" like \"only valid 2/1/15\" would be better if this was the case.  Either the staff was wrong or the coupon was poorly worded in multiple sentences.  At any rate, unfortunately as I love their food and Coca Cola Freestyle, this location (and probably promo emails) just can't be trusted to do the right thing.  They were not willing to give the promo so we walked out.  I would think customer service would be more important than sticking to their misunderstanding of the promo. Won't be back to this location again and will think twice about using their email promotions. Shame."}
{"text":"Top notch customer service is absolutely right! I mistakenly ordered the wrong sandwich. Instead of pointing out my mistake, Bobby got the sandwich I really wanted and  made me feel appreciated. He had every right to point out my error, but took the opportunity to make me feel welcomed. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Placed an order through Uber eats for 2 turkey Cobb salads and 2 sandwiches with soup.  Didn't receive one of the salads and the one we did receive had chicken instead of turkey as well as other items we requested to take off.  Reordered the salads and they arrived 40 mins later only to have chicken again instead of turkey and still had items we asked to take off.  I've been trying to call the location for 20 mins and it keeps giving a busy signal."}
{"text":"I ordered the apple cranberry walnut chicken salad. It obviously had apple, cranberries, walnut, and chicken in it, but also had croutons, red onions, and goat cheese. I was very pleasantly surprised about the goat cheese. It gave the salad a nice little tanginess that really elevated the salad. The salad was good. It had a lot of different textures and fruity flavors going on to balance the savory flavory of the chicken and the tanginess of the goat cheese. I ordered the fat free raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing with it. The salad dressing by itself honestly tasted like a raspberry syrup that an ice cream shop would put on your sundae. I was a little skeptical about how this would taste on the salad and how healthy it was so I went pretty light on the dressing. It tasted good with the salad. I would not recommend drenching the salad in it though.  Whoever made the salad was pretty heavy handed with the cranberries there was about half a cup of cranberries left in my container when I was done eating. That may be a bonus for some people I guess. For me, I don't really want the extra sugar.     My boyfriend ordered the Texmex brisket sandwich. I tried it and it had a decent flavor, but other than that I wasn't overly impressed. The sandwich had one texture throughout. There was barely a difference between the texture of the meat and the veggies. I also felt that the brisket was over cooked. It was way too mushy.   I have had other sandwiches here that I have liked better but they too have needed a little help.  The price range for what you are getting also seems a little high."}
{"text":"When it comes time for a lazy Sunday and figuring out eating drive thru cafe food this is the place to be ! I love the fact they always pull me in with the plethora of coupons! The French Dip is always delicious and I highly recommend it !"}
{"text":"Went to Schlozskys for lunch because it was a free sandwich for my birthday!! So with that said IT WAS THE BEST SANDWICH EVER!!! Haha I had the Chipotle Chicken on jalapeno bread, it was very delish!! I have never had a bad experience with Schlotzkys! I am a fan!"}
{"text":"3 stars to be fair cuz usually 5 stars but once 1star - ill explain. they cut my sandwich in half and right down the middle was a dead fly cut in half. half a fly on either side. then i politely asked for a refund not trying to make a scene, also grossed out a bit. they gave me $6 store credit. which isnt enough for anything there. it was funny really. but weird and unlikely"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the sandwich I got from here. The drive-thru lady was snippy when I asked questions about the sandwiches. When I ordered what I thought was a hot Turkey sandwich with guac, swiss, and lettuce...no, that would be too easy. My sandwich had onions, tomatoes, and bacon on it. After taking off the offending extras (I had since driven off and on the freeway), the sandwich was disappointing. Soggy, falling apart and flavorless. I have definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"I decided to have a sandwich and was craving the chewy bread from Schlotzsky.  So I walked in and got the Turkey Bacon Club on sourdough.  It was very good.  Got the original chips and an ice tea.  The store was clean, nice, and has a lot of seating areas.  The staff was very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"This plaza is always packed around lunch time. I try to get here before 11:30am to avoid the lunch RUSH. This Schlotzsky's is clean, employees are nice, and they have food to you pretty quickly.   My favie is the sourdough angus pastrami & swiss. SO good. And the pizza meal deal for lunch is a great choice too."}
{"text":"Wish I could give half a star. I ordered from here 2 nights ago got a simple salad to go. Got home excited to eat open my bowl and BAM! A nasty looking hair in my food. I tried to call it was 820 at the time(they were still open) they did not answer. So I called the following day and a boy named Andrew or Anthony answered saying he was the manager and they'd comp me just write his name on the receipt. The nice lady in the front gave me the option to not get a receipt which is what I chose. I let him know that and he said \"well I can't do anything for you\" I was like I have a picture of it and I'm sure your cashier will remember me there was nobody else in there. He refused. So here I am $10 short with no salad. Btw the guac you gave me in the salad was completely black and the ranch was diluted. Thanks for my first try here being a disaster. Never again."}
{"text":"GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR FOOD....  After spending the past couple of days sitting with my daughter in the hospital, I thought it would be nice to go to a sandwich shop that I remembered from childhood. We got the family meal for $30.00. We selected a brisket Mac and three sandwiches. This wasn't too bad except we had to add our drinks which made the total almost $43.00. The time on my receipt said 5:54 pm. We didn't receive our food until 6:35. That was after both my mother and I complained about the wait for a fast food restaurant.  The excuse for the wait was that the drive through for busy and they had a Grubhub order come in. In other words, if you decide to go out and have a family meal in the restaurant, you're not important. Your time isn't as important as those sitting in their cars or on their butts at home.  The food was very good and the staff was pleasant enough, even the manager came out to explain the delay. They were very nice, but that doesn't excuse being made to wait 40 minutes for a meal.  BTW, the mix on the sodas was off making them taste funny and the iced tasted old.  If you want to eat here in the restaurant, go through the drive thru to get your food first, then go inside to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place !!!! Lady In front is so sweet she always says thank you ! I had the original with turkey ! I love there bread it isn't like a regular sub or a sliced bread sandwich. I love the jalapeño bread.  The Schlotzsky's hot sauce is my favorite ! I asked for extra lettuce and they did just that !! Been here more than a handful and every tine it's great"}
{"text":"My husband and I (who are new to Az.) found this place by accident (we where going to home depot ). My husband loves the fact that he can customize his size of sandwich depending oh his hunger level that time.  I like the flat bread pizza, although they over do the balsamic drizzle a little.  Chicken soup was really good.  We took our son when he moved to Az. Later on and he was impressed as well."}
{"text":"I had the large Pastrami Reuben on sourdough. Large is no joke, big enough for 3 & delicious. Ate it for 2 days. My only reason not to give stars is the $3 delivery & $17 minimum for delivery. It's a lot of extra if one person wants to order lunch."}
{"text":"The food I usually good. Service is usually ok to. But sometimes when you order stuff they call and tell you that they don't serve that item and don't know what it is. And that's not to say anything is bad but just an FYI."}
{"text":"Went to this location today and ordered the beef chief meal and total was 10.08 when my phone beeped and my chase account told me I paid 13.08 3 dollars more then I approved and what was on my recite I called. They told me that that is normal that it would go off my account in a couple of days . So I was over charged and got a excuse that I had never heard before . I called other locations and they said this is not normal and they did not do this there. I never in my life have had any thing like this happen to me . My friend went the same day and they did the same thing . So if this money does not go back in my account in a couple of days then legal matters will happen .. It's not the 3 dollars it's the principles how many people are they screwing over that do not check there account .. Be aware people"}
{"text":"Definitely a go to place for pizza's, flatbreads, sandwiches, soup & salads.  I LOVE THE BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA!!!!   & Those Sweet Cinnabons!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast quesadilla and it was decent. They give you 2 pieces. Not huge portions.   If you're going across the way to the breakfast burgers spot, their meals come with tater tots!  The breakfast sandwiches are bigger here, than at the other spot. I would eat here again, it's not bad for food court meal.  The service was minimal! Don't expect a smile, a warm greeting any kind of good customer service skills at all!"}
{"text":"With quality that far surpasses your average franchise sammich shop and a variety that will please your palette on any given day, this place is an easy choice for both lunch and dinner options.  Don't sleep."}
{"text":"I've never had a sandwich from here but I went one day (okay okay twice) for a Cinnabon and the lady in the drive through is always so cheery and happy to be working! Love ordering from her! This is how drive throughs should be!"}
{"text":"On of the worst things about living in Hickory, NC is that they can't seem to keep a GOOD, reasonably priced, restaurant. One of my favorite places used to be Schlotzsky's Deli, which was in a great location. The food was ALWAYS good there, and everything that I ate was excellent. I was really disappointed when they closed.   My favorite sandwich at Schlotzsky's Deli is definitely their Pastrami Reuben on Rye - which is amazingly good. So good, in fact, that I order this every single time.   Now I have to drive 30 minutes to Gastonia to get my Schlotzsky's \"fix,\" but it's totally worth the inconvenience. Schlotzsky's Deli has delicious sandwiches, freshly made, at reasonable prices.   (I hope that someone eventually reopens a franchise location in Mountain View / Hickory.)"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are so good - I always get the original. The people that work here are friendly and the service is quick even when they are slammed. My only complaint is the sandwiches could use a little more meat, felt like it was mostly bread last time. Either way they are delicious, especially with the hot sauce they give you. Gotta try this place if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"this was THE WORST SERVICE EVER ! its 8:30pm ( no long drivethru line ) and the server rushed me for my order then didnt even acknowledge ( hi , hello , repeat of my order , goodnight , thanks for coming )  , greet me at the window nor giving me my change and food ! rudely closed the door . i wish i got her name !! i asked for a Classic Roll with a lot of creme on it & gave me THE EXACT OPPOSITE . first time here and last time ."}
{"text":"Fast and great service and the sandwiches are delicious!  Pizza is good too!  My son is very picky and he loves it!"}
{"text":"Wish there were more locations but never mind driving out of my way for one of their delicious sandwiches! The service at this location is always great and keeps us returning!"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches are huge!! Like I figured they would be small like Starbucks sandwiches but wow was I wrong!! The people in the drive through were so nice and pleasant as it was not even 9 a.m. yet. I know I'm not that cheerful that early so it made my day. The only downside was they only sell their orange juice by the small bottle, I love orange juice but I would set to for their amazing tea than."}
{"text":"Have always loved the consistency of Schlosky's. Of course the creativity of a different type of sandwich. Not you Father's sub shop! The Tempe location has a great outdoor patio as well and the service is always on point. If you haven't tried it and you love sandwiches this place is a must try! And for all you vegetarians they are veg friendly!"}
{"text":"First time here. Left the hotel across the street and saw a drive-thru. Headed over and ordered a beef sandwich with Jalapeno chips. Shit was good! Only complaint was I thought I had just eaten a whole onion and a clove of garlic. I would definitely go back! Hooraa!"}
{"text":"The employees are friendly, however the manager at this location needs an attitude adjustment.  Perhaps working in a business where being friendly/respectful to customers is not your forte and you need to seek a job that doesn't deal with the public."}
{"text":"Did you know they have pizza's here?! Even better - Cinnabon! I don't have to get outta my car and walk a mile in a mall to feed my face a Cinnabon!   Score one for them!! They have the pecan and original Cinnabon. Both delicious...except when lukewarm. Seems these are best when eaten warm...and only the middle. LoL  I've had the Chicken Pesto \"10 pizza - delicious!! Huge pie that can serve 2, or 1 uncomfortably. LoL I've also tried the ham and jalapeno...egh. Not as great as the other. Huge slices of ham and sliced jalapeno.   The ladies in the drive thru are always nice and for pizza's, their pretty quick to serve up. Oh and the large soda, it's huge! I'm pretty sure it's bigger than 32oz. I keep forgetting and my eyes bulge at its hugeness. Ha!"}
{"text":"The older gentleman running the drive through was probably one of the nicest men I've encountered in a long time. Foods always amazing. Will be back soon. Great service!"}
{"text":"Manager is completely RUDE to his employees. She asked for help with our Cinnabon order and he yelled from the back for who .. you? Then I said loudly \"No, me!\" Then he came out. She repeated our order twice before she went to the back and he still got it wrong. Then was annoyed when he had to redo it. She was in the back getting food ready for guests that were sitting down and he kept yelling her name and rolling his eyes. When we told him we were there last night but no lights were on so we thought they were closed even though it said open until 9 he said he was the new GM and that was not what he wanted to hear. I can't help thinking that the way he treats his employees they will be looking for a new GM shortly."}
{"text":"My first trip to Schlotzskys. Was with a group of 7. They ran out of the medium sized bread and subs two smalls instead.  The staff was very friendly.  The Tuscan was really good."}
{"text":"Zero stars today: placed my order,  paid and waited, and waited.  Come to find my order sitting on the counter for the last 10 minutes.   When I tried to question a staff member she just smiled and walked away.   UNACCEPTABLE."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the service far exceeds what you'd expect from fast food."}
{"text":"Always quick service and always exactly as I order!"}
{"text":"I probably could not love this place more if I tried. Sooo good! Big selection of sandwiches, and the bread is delicious. They also have awesome soups and salads. Really great place for lunch. And they have free wi-fi! I used to work right around the corner and ate there once a week and have never ordered anything I didn't enjoy. :)"}
{"text":"How yummy can fast food be? Real yummy!   As a first timer to this brand, my arrival to Phoenix was late at night. The name threw me off being an east coaster I was thinking bagels and lox! However I was greeted by an array of salads of colors and variety which made me super happy! I chose the turkey avocado Cobb, hold the eggs please and a carvel swirl (yes! That makes me uber happy!)  Pricing was marvelous (damage was under $12) and the girl handling the counter was very sweet!   With the variety of sandwiches and salads I'll be sure to visit again, as my salad was fresh, yummy and definite kudos for not throwing dressing into it - to go - thus not providing a soggy lettuce fest by the time I would get back to my hotel room!  I would love to see them on the east coast. 5 star yumminess all around!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the last hidden Gems here in Vegas. The management is incredibly courteous and service is above par! Food is always great, don't neglect this vintage treasure, every time I come here I am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I decided to drop in here for lunch having never tried a Schlotzky's before and after having heard (some) good things.  The exterior is nothing special; there is a small parking lot that is in a bit of disrepair.   Inside you'll find a basic interior that seems to be going for the simple New York deli look. Simple tables and wooden chairs.  It was not busy at all though it was the middle of the day. There is a self service soda station.   There is a large menu board, but it contains few details about what is actually on the items (eg what comes on the turkey sandwich?). It does list calories, however. They do have a lot of different options including tons of sandwiches and pizzas as well. The gentleman taking orders had a friendly sort of gruffness (if that makes sense). He had a very stoic expression, though, so I was never sure if he was serious or kidding. Him: Do you want cheese on that? Me: Do you have Swiss? Him: Well, only for you. After you order you wait for them to call out the order from the little pickup window.   The turkey sandwich was pretty good. I didn't realize it was going to be served hot (I couldn't see that outlined anywhere on the menu), but that was OK. The bread was sort of a light and airy roll with a somewhat glossy surface. The turkey was OK; it seemed like basic lunch meat quality. The vegetables (lettuce and tomato) were similarly OK; I did like the spicy mustard which really made the whole sandwich. There was a small bit of melted Swiss cheese.  They have their own cute brand of chips (regular and baked). The plain baked tasted like baked Lays, so nothing to write home about.   The interior was fairly clean, although trash had accumulated around the drink station.   Overall a decent meal with nothing particularly good or bad."}
{"text":"I went off the grid and ordered something they are possibly not known for, the chicken ceasar wrap.  I was insulted by what I got for paying I believe 6 dollars for.  When I looked inside of it, their may have been the collection of a small chicken leg as far as the portion of meat, it did not exist.  The entire thing was stuffed with iced berg lettuce.  The cost of this piece of crap may have been a dollar, a mark up up 5 dollars thanks.  I left hungry and unsatisfied, never again.  QT and grocery stores have better wraps then this place and far less cheaper."}
{"text":"Love the roast beef and cheese on sourdough!  This location is close to my work so I'm a frequent flyer.  I have always had great customer service here as well as their other locations.  Ya the prices are more than your Subway $5 foot long but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I have not been to a Schlotzsky's since I moved back from Oklahoma City. There are so many other restaurants in the valley, I just never went back to Schlotzsky's. I remember when the meat on the sandwich was thicker than the bread. I don't know if the quality has declined, or if it is just this location. I ordered a turkey guacamole sandwich and the only meat on the sandwiches one little glob in the middle and that's it. I ended up throwing half of my sandwich away because it was all bread. Looking through the photos at this location, it seems that this practice is fairly consistent within all of the sandwiches that come out of there."}
{"text":"I like this 'fast food' option...something different and a little healthier when you are on the go. Their original on sourdough in a favorite. I have only used the drive through, and they were fast and friendly."}
{"text":"VERY slow.  I went about 2:15.  The place was almost empty, but it was after 2:30 when I got my sandwich.  I specifically asked for no pickle.  She said the pickle spear comes on the side.  I told her I didn't want it anywhere near my sandwich.  She said she would take care of it.  When I got home and looked in the bag, there was a large pickle spear.  After two bites I finally threw the sandwich away.  It tasted like someone poured pickle juice on it.  Maybe that's what I get for complaining about it taking so long to get a sandwich.  The sandwich looked pretty good, but the bun was a little stale.  Obviously I will never go back."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole! The lovely lady working the til, named Natalie (I think((if not she was the cute girl with curly hair, very young & sweet as can be!))) she took her time with each customer & really made me smile.  I noticed how she took care of an older couple & made them laugh before I got up to the til. She radiates happiness. I already came into a very happy atmosphere.  I wanted to wait to tell the manager how amazing she was. But they weren't in, so if they read this I hope you guys keep a tight hold on her! She really cares about the people she's helping through the line. I never see that genuine personality in people anymore. I'll definitely be back & bring some friends! Thank you so much Natalie for truly customizing my visit!"}
{"text":"Sad to see it close, was my go-to lunch place.  Great owner & workers, food was always good. Don't think it will reopen, everything up for auction on 2/8/18."}
{"text":"Soup temperature is not hot enough to kill bacteria. Please check. I think the health code calls for a minimum of 145 degrees."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, and took around 10 min to get a cinnamon roll when I was the only customer in the store! They didn't give me the one right up front in the display case for some reason, which didn't make sense. Once I got home to eat, it was very stale. I won't return."}
{"text":"This is where I go when I want to treat myself.  My favorite is their Original on wheat, but they have other bread options, several types of sandwiches, and soups.  If you are still hungry they have gooey Cinnabon (cinnamon buns) available too.  (They smell so good, but I am always full from the Original.)  The restaurant is often pretty full but I've always found a seat.  The drive through is efficient too."}
{"text":"Finally, we live closer to a Schlotzky's. Although, I find it very mean that now they have a Cinnabon display right in front of the counter. How can you resist? It's a love hate relationship for sure.  Schlotzky's never disappoints. I love their sandwitches. This time hubby and I shared a regular turkey club on sour dough bread. Baked to perfection and super flavorful. Just the right amount of turkey, mayonnaise, and lettuce and cheese. Sounds simple but yet they manage to make it special.   So far it has always been clean and staff is friendly and professional. I will be back."}
{"text":"You won't find a better sandwich than a schlotzskys sandwich. Their bread is out of this world, especially when it comes to their jalapeño bread. Trust me on that one. I know it looks like a normal fast food place but they are unlike anyone one else in their category, and exceed them all."}
{"text":"Drive through Cinnabun.  Only reason I came.  Split a regular sized one with my two sons.  Two stars off for it not being heated.  Boo..."}
{"text":"Our little family has been eating at this location since we moved to Vegas a couple of years ago. The food is always excellent!  The staff is awesome!  The manager/owner of this eatery is personable and engaging!  The sandwich maker is THE BEST. My husband and son rave at her sandwiches and she is a super sweet lady as well."}
{"text":"I ordered a small order of the turkey and guacamole sandwich and a small drink which was a total of $10. I wouldn't necessarily rate this place to be cheap for being a fast food sandwich restaurant. Though I was happy with my sandwich and the quality of it. Could've had a bit more meat but it was still very good. The service was great and so was their tea. I'm overall satisfied and looking forward to trying out some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Love this place - nice and clean - great staff - great food - try flat bread pizza - Chicken pesto - very good!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I haven't eaten at a Schlotzsky's since around 2001. Now, I know why it's been 13 years.  I agree w/a lot of what Marc T. mentioned in his review also. The menu was rather bland and disappointing. I did opt for the Classic combo #1 and was excited as there involved some Italian cold cuts. It arrived semi-warm/toasted, but... I dunno - it just didn't appeal to me (taste, texture - everything). It was a rather confusing sandwich, shall I say? I guess I would never think to put mustard and mayo w/an Italian sandwich (cuts, black olives, etc). Plus their bread doesn't excite me either. It's too thick for me. I'll stick w/Quiznos for toasted sandwiches moving forward.  I AM stoked that they serve Cinnabon's at this restaurant because who doesn't love the gooey overload of wonder-dessert? Yes, my blood sugar spikes highly and I feel like a legless slug after consuming one, but it's so sinfully delicious."}
{"text":"I come to Schlotskys usually when I'm on the west side and usually order a medium deluxe no tomato, cup of broccoli and cheese and a drink. To me the sandwich I order just tastes awesome with extra mustard which I usually ask for 6 packets of mustard because of my fondness for the yellow stuff. I was almost to painful to watch the gentleman behind the counter to part with that many packets.... which I used each and EVERYONE of them. Food quality is always spot on, which I would happily give 5 stars but in this case they garner only 3 stars."}
{"text":"Light sandwiches, fresher meat than subway. Don't have that much to say except this will be my new subway!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh. It's like a place my white bread grandparents would go to on a Wednesday for lunch.  Nothing tastes bad... but nothing tastes good either."}
{"text":"Yall are lucky your food is pretty delicious because you're rude AF and it takes FOREVER to get said food."}
{"text":"Very dirty. Tons of flies in restaurant, which constantly land in your food. The whole place looks very outdated as well as run down. Roof tiles are warping and look like they're going to collapse. If you want to spend money to eat at a dirty run down business this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I think all sandwich shops should have a drive thru!   I live close by and like to roll through here at least once a month.  The sandwiches are always spot on! And dont get me started on their BBQ chips!   The employees are a bit \"cracky\" but super friendly and funny and I love them!   This location has been there for years and I hope it stays that way!"}
{"text":"I purchased an Original sandwich and honestly the bread didn't seem as if it was baked good enough. The sandwich overall taste was just oknthis time.   I also ordered a Cinnabon since they're sold at this location. I was not impressed. It didn't taste like the cinnabons from a regular store and it was very chewy inside. I will not order another from this location and it may be a long while before I return for a sandwich"}
{"text":"It's time to update my review.  We decided to give this location another try and believe it or not, the girl behind the counter was even grumpier than the first time.  I really can't give four stars to an establishment with such horrible customer service.  In addition, my son ordered a bbq chicken and jalapeno pizza, which he said was horrible.  He only ate two slices and was done.  My daughter ordered broccoli and cheddar soup that was delivered with cold spots throughout the bowl.  Not cool.  Why the three stars? Because the sandwiches are pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Schlotzsky's in a long time. I went because I was watching old episodes of Undercover Boss and caught the episode on Cinnabon. Since I saw there was a Cinnabon in this Schlotzsky's, and it was close to my home, I felt a hankering for a cinnamon roll and maybe a sandwich.  The girl today at the register was very pleasant. I ordered and went to restroom while my food was being made. When I came back, I was expecting to find a seat and then come up to the counter to get my food. (It was slow at the time I came to eat.) Instead, I saw the girl at the register had set my food at a table near the window, ready to eat. Since I hadn't ordered a drink, she gave me a cup for water. I didn't even ask for one, but realized it was needed when it came to the cinnamon roll because of the sweetness.  I thought the whole experience was a nice gesture of hospitality. I don't think that I have seen many restaurants similar to this one that went the extra mile like this. I should have got the girl's name, she was wonderful."}
{"text":"Go here all the time now that I live close to one.  I always get the original on sourdough and it's always fantastic!  I've also tried the cinnamon rolls and they are delicious!  When using the drive thru the wait can be longer than normal but that's what you get for delicious food!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Their pastrami sandwich is pretty good. We also had a salad (chicken walnut, I believe), which was delicious. The bread is huge. If you like Cinnabon, that is there as well. I would not get pizza at a place called Schlotzsky's Deli. Just saying. Stick to the deli meats."}
{"text":"The sausage flatbread is horrible.  And they ration napkins.  Disaster."}
{"text":"They forgot to add chips to both of our bags. This place is way too expensive to forget the chips when you buy a combo. Annoying. How hard is their job? And the public phone number for the location is incorrect. I literally had no way to contact this location to tell them about the missing parts of my order which is also frustrating.   Management, Get it together!"}
{"text":"We both hadn't been here for years. We ordered the chicken cordon blue and the pastrami sandwiches- both regular (three sizes, but don't bother with the small size because it's more like snack size) and split it. The chicken cordon blue was perfect(high marks for this one)- fresh baked bun spongy, thinly sliced chicken with thinly sliced ham and topped with a slice of crispy bacon (wasn't expecting the bacon but it worked). Very good and satisfying. The pastrami (on dark rye) sandwich was good but the meat was extremely fatty- even after trimming it off before eating it. My husband pulled out large pieces of fat from his half too. If you still plan on getting it, use a plastic knife to trim off all the fat. My husband loves their fresh baked bread- pretty unique as far as delis go.  The deli is well stocked with many choices besides sandwiches, including pizza, salads, soups, chips, pickles, and cookies (my husband who has a sweet tooth, enjoyed the cookie- soft and chewy). Free refills on drinks.   This place looks really small from the outside, but it's like a teepee- spacious inside with lots of tables and bathrooms in the back. Also has a drive-thru window and does catering as well. The staff is nice and you get your food pretty quick."}
{"text":"This place no longer has a franchise in Hawaii.   This place has awesome pizzas. That I'd all I have to say. When I visit Vegas, I try to stop here. They have individual pizzas that are good. The crust is crispy. The BBQ chicken and jalapeño or the veggie are my recommendations. The pizzas just take a little while to cook, so be prepared to wait 10 minutes or so.  I have never had a sub but have heard that's what they are known for, I will have to try one...if I can ever tear myself away from their pizzas... ^_^*~"}
{"text":"Aaaaaaaaa-mazing this place is so slept on. I just got an iud so i'm like in pain and cramps & I've never actually been to Schlotzsky's before but soon as I seen that Cinnabon sign I knew it might be gas. So we pull up & jaws hit the ground. So many yummy options and sandwiches and salads and mac and cheese and pizza it's heaven i got the turkey club and shrimp max & cheese it was to die for such large portions too I was amazed. My boyfriend got the bacon grilled cheese and the brisket mac & cheese I didn't even try any of his food cause mine was so good. Anyway Schlotzskys is that heat and I'm a loyal customer now."}
{"text":"Ordered sandwiches for delivery for my staff today, we received the wrong item and we called to let them know, not only did they not care it was wrong, the employee was yelling in the background at the Owner in Spanish thinking we couldn't understand, I can't believe the Owner Eduardo would not care to even discuss. He stated his employee was right. They should be embarrassed to operate like this and provide this kind of service, I would  definitely not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Do you like it hot??  I dont. Well lemme say, I like certain sandwiches warm and toasty but not one with avocado. We came here a while ago because I LOVE deli sandwiches. I have never been here so I was EXCITED. Like a virgins first lay I was let down : (  I love any sandwich with avocado, alas its an add on so it more expensive so I opted for the turkey bacon club with avocado. They ask what size I want. So I pick the medium bc the small looked itty bitty, I opted for the combo but was kinda irritated when it was almost 9$! I think paying as much as a small steak dinner for a deli sandwich is preposterous!   We sat and waited for our meals, it took a little time (which was weird bc they werent even busy!) but our food finally came out . I grabbed my sandwich and felt it was warm and was like \"wtf?\" Im not a fan. The sandwich was meh and I was just over this place. I felt like I was eating a turkey burger bc of the round bun also, weird!!   I will not come back, too expensive and the food wasnt worth the price!"}
{"text":"Small Santa Fe  for me, a Chicken Cordon Bleu for my son, and we're sharing a Mini Pecanbon.  Service was kinda slow for 230 pm but I noticed business picked up significantly in the drive thru about 15 minutes later.   I got some strange piece of something in my sandwich and the manager on duty sorta explained what it was and offered to make me a fresh sandwich.  I declined the remake and told her it was alright but wanted to let them know.  She was more than willing to make it right.  :-) The Cinnabon just aren't nearly as good as they were when they had them in Fiesta Mall, Smitty's (even their day old), or Chandler Mall.  Dough doesn't seem cooked thoroughly and even on the Minions you get an almost mushy center.  :-(  I suppose it's just as well cuz i don't need to be eating anymore of that stuff.   I like Schlotzskys, but so glad it isn't so close to home because I know I would get burned out on this stuff."}
{"text":"Seriously... Best food ever. First time trying it. My dad just took me out for lunch there. Definitely my new comfort food!!"}
{"text":"I went to Schlotzsky's for a freebie Cinnabon for Nurses Week.  The person at the drive thru handed me a mini instead of a regular even though the advertisement clearly said you're choice of regular, mini or bon bites.  I politely asked again to get a regular to which I was told that I could only have a mini.  I was then handed a mini Cinnabon in the box without even being put in a bag or given utensils to eat it with.  I immediately opened the small little box to discover that the mini Cinnabon had been dumped over and looked like it had been dropped on the floor.  I just drove away.  I guess I know how they feel about Nurses now.  So much for Nurses Week"}
{"text":"My first impression of this business was not the best, but the owner took the time out of his day to make sure that I was satisfied and any misunderstandings were seen to. A company with an owner willing to sit down and handle matters personally is a company I'd gladly give my business to. Customer service is a must and this place seems to have it in abundance! Soon enough, I'll have tried the food as well and I'm sure will love it. :)"}
{"text":"Picking up food for a friend wanted soup and a sandwich since i just left the gym I wanted a drive thru.  Realized I haven't had this in a while now I remember why. I called 3 times to see what food they I found a menu online decided chicken and dumplings since they never picked up. Got there they had tomato French onion and broccoli cheddar, settled on tomatoe. The food is great even though it's a little expensive but you pay for drive thru convenience.  Dt-534"}
{"text":"Not overly impressed. I stopped in with some colleagues while on business in the Phoenix area. I'm trying to limit my meat intake and opted for the veggie sandwich. Major disappointment! I essentially got shredded iceberg lettuce and tomato with some herb spread and a slice of cheese. I think that if a restaurant is going to put out a vegetarian selection they should be a little more serious than lettuce and tomato. Mushrooms, cucumber, romaine instead of iceberg, bell peppers, spinach and avocado are all good options.  I will say that the chips were great and the smell of Cinnabon in the place was divine."}
{"text":"Just ok.  First time diner.  Reuben on dark rye.  Uneven meat ( much thinner towards edges), kraut and spicy mustard good.   Enen through they bake their bread, firehouse for the same price offers more.  I would rank this third, firehouse, Quiznos, schoyzkys, subway. For chain quality food and price.   Quick service.   No first responder/military discount or wifi.    All cards welcome, but they have an odd debit card sign up about holding funds.  Must be because of the college close by."}
{"text":"I was driving around and wanted to get something to eat and stumbled a crossed this Schlotzsky's Deli... I had not been to one in years so I had to stop I entered to a really friendly staff I looked over the menu and went with the Medium beef & cheese on Sourdough... I rate the experience as followed.  Medium Beef & Cheese - B +  I really enjoyed the meal it was a good sandwich I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Super clean location. Friendly staff. Delicious food! Try the fiesta chicken on sourdough, very tasty."}
{"text":"Turkey Bacon Club on a fresh-baked sour dough = perfection. Also location has Cinnabon and FREE wifi"}
{"text":"Disappointing. We ordered the food for pick up as we were looking for something to eat while we were doing house work, and Schlotzsky's was a little bit of a let down. I tried one of their pick two options to get a salad and a sandwich, and the salad I got had avocado that was disappointing. We ordered the food for pick up as we were looking for something to eat while we were doing house work, and Schlotzsky's was a little bit of a let down.   I tried one of their pick two options to get a salad and a sandwich, and the salad I got had avocado that was almost completely dark (shown in the attached picture). I don't see how anybody in food service can be okay with selling food of that quality. It was quite an underwhelming disappointment.   Honestly, the sandwich was pretty good, and the salad wasn't half bad either, but it wasn't really anything special. I would categorize this place as slightly higher quality (if any higher at all) than Subway. Pretty much all of the ingredients kind of seemed like they came out of a bag. I guess that's kind of what you're paying for however because the prices were pretty low.   Maybe try this place out but definitely don't go out of your way, and be cautious about the avocado!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I got a lunch special from Uber Eats and well, it was the worst sandwich I have had in a long time. The meat tasted slimy and the bread was stale. On top of that, the mac n cheese tasted cold, too hard and oh yeah, no cheese!! How do you mess that up? I complained to the store and the guy on the phone didn't care. Of course not, you got your money!  There's a reason there's not many Schlotzkskys around."}
{"text":"Soo good. Breakfast burrito was fantastic, chicken salad so good. Great meat slices in all the foods . Great price and portion."}
{"text":"Tried the French dip @Schlotzskys and it was extremely disappointong....don't even get me started with the soup..  This place must not do much business because i'm always visiting at lunch or dinner and I'm always the ONLY customer.  This time the soup was cold and at the bottom, I said something, they brought out more but just put it in the well and still left the cold soup out. I had to pass and it's really the ONLY reason I come back.  My sandwich was barely just ok, the bread was a little undercooked and moist.-the beef was bland and chewy........and the price was outrageous!!! $35 for 3 sandwiches,2 soups and 3 drinks!!!!  I used to love this place but I guess the owner just doesn't give a shit anymore..."}
{"text":"I ate the vegetarian sandwich here. It was fairly good. I still prefer the subways but it is good to eat once in a while. Its got that taste of a family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Impressively bad. Food was bad, service was terrible. Overall this was a dining experience gone terribly wrong. It's a dirty atmosphere, we got there at 10:20 am on a day they opened at 10 to locked doors and two employees sitting around talking.   My advice, just go to quizno's or subway."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here and we drive all the way from Charlotte as there are none in Charlotte!!  Also nice to have a cinnabon every once and a while with an awesome original sandwich and salt and vinegar chips!!  Best fast food and soon much better then a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Cold, dried out cinnamon rolls that definitely did not taste fresh even though I stopped by around 730 am... Maybe I need to go to an actual Cinnamon? Not worth the calories."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I wish there were more around town. My favorite is the turkey original. And of course the hot sauce they have is great to sprinkle on every bite! The Wisconsin Cheddar Soup is killer too."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Service was horrible - cashier was clearly annoyed we were bothering her by ordering."}
{"text":"I dropped my mom off for a surgery appointment and was looking for something to eat at 9 am. Got a medium eggsky sandwich with sausage on sourdough. The sandwich was much larger than I expected it. They walked it out to my table, straight from the microwave. The bread was tasteless, spongey, no hint of flavor, reminded me of day old Pizza Hut breadsticks. Egg was overcooked. Hell it was probably precooked and came in a plastic bag anyway, sausage was bland. I honestly have never been to a Schlotsky's before, and I will never be returning. How the hell do people eat this."}
{"text":"Great customer service. The guy that helped me was really nice and patient with me. ( I had sore throat and couldn't talk well lol) super clean . He even wished me well. Definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"While I'd consider this a fast food restaurant, it's probably one of the healthiest options you'll find around town for quick food. It definitely doesn't fit the mold of greasy fast food & I'm a big fan of this place.  I've always had problems with the name, but that's an entirely different story. As for the food, their sandwiches are really good. They have your typical selection of sandwich options, served on your choice of round bun. The bread here is great as I always opt for the large sourdough. Every sandwich I've tried here has been really good, especially for the quickness in which they prepare it. You will have to wait a couple of minutes for your food, but nothing crazy.  They have a pretty big dining area, along with a patio area for your nice days. And even though it may not be as quick as your normal fast food, they also have a drive though window for you lazy people out there. Plus, they have free wi-fi, which I've never understood because I've never seen someone in there using it.  So Schlotzsky's is a great little sandwich chain that just barely fits into the fast food realm. The food is so much better, & presumably healthier, than your normal fast food fare. It can be a quick in & out eating here & you'll be happy with your sandwich & chips."}
{"text":"Service is always below average and I am pretty sure the staff was making fun a few customers (the one time I go inside). The food wasn't very tasty at this location."}
{"text":"Nothing better than stopping by Schlotskys after a hike up Crowders mountain.  The only thing I always wish Is that my sandwich won't end."}
{"text":"Easy location to find in the Excalibur food court. I stayed at the Luxor so it was a quick walk over. Plenty of places to sit even at peak breakfast time.  Onto the food: I ate the breakfast quesadilla with sausage. The tortilla was a bit too flaky and broke too easily when I tried eating it. Sausage was a bit bland so I'd switch to a different add on next time. The quesadilla itself was large so worth the price I paid.   Service was unimpressive. Cashier seemed like she was in a bad mood and it took them close to 10 minutes to get the food made. I categorize this place as borderline fast food so close to 10 minutes is pretty slow."}
{"text":"The \"Original\" is still my favorite! You can't go wrong with this sandwich! The bread here is what makes their sandwiches different from other delis. So if it is your first visit... try the Original. Even though they have a vast menu of lunch items that are pretty tasty. Flat breads, salads, wraps, and even pizzas! I haven't had the flat bread.... The Turkey Avacado Cobb and the Southwest Chicken Salad are both good, and the Veggie Pizza is another of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I can't remember ever having sampled a Schlotzky's sandwich before this summer, but I heard my friend extoll their virtues many times as we planned our trip to Las Vegas.  She insisted we HAD to eat at a Schlotzky's before we left.  We were staying down on the strip, but we used our Yelp app to locate this Schlotzky's and guide us here.  The first thing I noticed upon entering were the bright red paint on the walls. It really is quite striking at first.  There was a television in the corner, and this sandwich shop is jam packed full of tables.  They were definitely trying to maximize the usable space.  The next thing I noticed was a neon sign proudly declaring that their bread is baked fresh daily.  That's certainly a good sign.  I walk up to the counter to peruse the menu and order.  I decide that I MUST try the Albuquerque Turkey sandwich (ha ha that rhymes) sandwich consisting of smoked turkey breast, crispy strips of bacon, mozzarella, cheddar, and parmesan cheeses, fire roasted veggies, lettuce, tomatoe, chipotle mayo - are you drooling yet? - on a freshly bakes Jalapeno cheese bun. OH YEEEEEEEEAH!  It was the perfect sandwich to introduce me to Schlotzky's and I must say I immediately became a fan.  I grabbed a bag of chips - oooooooh, excitement, they have two different flavors of baked chips, regular and barbeque.  I head over to the soda fountain to get a drinkzsky (their cutesy term, not mine).  Bummer, the only diet soda option is Diet Coke, but they do have three kinds of tea: passion fruit, unsweetened, and Southern sweet tea.  Last cutezsky note: There is a sign on the wall announcing that they do catering \"we're haulin bunz\" and the restrooms are labeled \"manly bunz\" and shapely bunz prompting me to contemplate what one does if they have shapely man bunz?  Enquiring minds want to know!"}
{"text":"2nd time I 've been here- ordered a sausage and basil flatbread, thought it was a sandwich. it was not- but what a great surprise I could NOT believe I got something so tasty from a drive thru!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, a good deal! It's not a place I would have picked to eat but my husbands loves this place. It was clean and inviting."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad for fast food. It was the only place open at 4am between our hotel and the club we were coming from. I got the caprese sandwich and the flavour was good,  the bread was fresh but the cheese wasn't melted though, which I would have preferred."}
{"text":"Great food! Awful service! 15 minutes and counting at the drive thru! Stopped last night and gave up. Came back for lunch today and same situation. Stuck in between cars now but won't be back."}
{"text":"I have dined at a few Schlotzsky's locations, however I am on the fence about this location. The staff is not knowledgeable of the menu and not friendly. When I go in every couple months and see a new menu item, I am curious as to what is in it and the spice level. The cashiers were not able to answer the questions when I asked on my past 2 visits which is a bit disappointing. Also, although they displayed an assortment of cinnamon buns in the display case, they were out of everything except the classic cinnamon buns. My thought is, take the display down if you don't have it."}
{"text":"A lot of people give me a hard time for liking Scholotzsky's but I just do! Their sourdough bread is my favorite and I always order the turkey original combo when I stop in. I highly recommend the pizza on their yummy sourdough crust, it is very unique and tasty. They are a little expensive but the portions are large and I always have leftovers. Good service and a drive through for your convenience. Come on, give it a shot. What do you have to lose??"}
{"text":"Drive thru sucks! Don't go here unless your absolutely desperate , like I was today for a cinnabon"}
{"text":"Slots n Key.... sssshhhhh lots keys.... however it's pronounced... this place has got me locked in.   In the last 2 weeks my bf and I have ordered delivery from Schlotzsky's more than 3 times and have not been disappointed yet. I've tried the turkey club, tuna melt, part of my bfs pastrami and chipotle sandwich (name is escaping my mind ATM). Plus... Cinnabon!!. And not a knock off cinnamon roll they call Cinnabon. Realllll Cinnabon. And I might be biased since I love cinnamon rolls, but it makes it any dinner two times better.   Their salads are really good too! The turkey Cobb is delicious and their Caesar is super hearty! I also love their chips. They are labeled as Schlotzky chips, so idk if they directly make them. But they are super good. I've only had the jalapeño chips."}
{"text":"I have order from here 2 times in the past 2 weeks via Uber eats. The first time my order came wrong. It was far off from what I had ordered so I didn't bother saying anything. The second time only half of our order came, and what had come was very disappointing. The sandwich was much smaller than the picture, minimal condiments inside and smashed. The Uber driver went and brought back the rest of our order, it was stale....Pretty disappointing. 2/2 times the order was wrong :/"}
{"text":"There's not a lot to say that hasn't been said already.  Only one thing that hasn't been mentioned...the jalapeno bread!  I usually have Albuquerque Turkey on jalapeno bread and it's fantastic.  Unlike the sour dough roll, which is quite chewy and almost tough, the jalapeno bread is easy to bite and a little crispy.  It's not spicy hot, which you might expect from the name.  It's just perfectly done.  Highly recommended sandwich place."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is really nice, with lots of comfy seating and warm inviting interior, and they have a Coca Cola Freestyle machine. The sandwiches themselves are really tasty. Unfortunately, my order was completely wrong when I ordered my sandwich to go. I had ordered the Caprese veggie sandwich, but when I got home and opened the wrapping I had gotten something on ciabatta bread, but with some ham and salami instead. Good thing I'm not vegetarian!   Unfortunately, by the time we got back home the restaurant was already closed so we couldn't call them to address the issue. Looking at the receipt, it's a fault of the kitchen and not the cashier since she rang up the order correctly. So if you eat here, it might be better to eat in so they can get your order right if they don't make it correctly the first time!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Schlotzsky's - the odd, round shaped sourdough bread with a slight toasty crunch, with ham, salami, Genoa and a blend of 3 melted cheeses with onions, lettuce and tomato - it's the classic number 1 \"original\" - my favorite. I have been known to try the chipotle chicken, the Rueben and the BBQ Chicken pizza as well - you can't go wrong with a sammy or pizza from this place. Get the free VIP card and save 10%. The service at this location is typically good and they bring the food to the table quickly. Always crowded at lunch.   If you have a hankerin' for something sweet, they offer Cinnabon products as well. YUM!"}
{"text":"A big fat FAIL to this Schlotzsky's location!!!! Had a dentist appointment and wanted to grab something to eat back at my desk at work.  Just went through the drive-thru and ordered my usual.  Turkey Bacon Club...everything cold EXCEPT the meat and cheese...on jalapeno bread.    They totally f-ed up my order.  I got bread, meat, and cheese.  No lettuce, tomato, or mayo.  Dry sandwich.   What part of I want everything cold...except the meat and cheese did they not flipping understand?!  Oh and apparently when you say you want jalapeno bread...that in their mind means sourdough.  Nothing like eating a dry sandwich.   Never going back to this location (though its right around the corner from my house).    Should have stopped by the one across the street from work."}
{"text":"So pregnancy has had me craving Schlotzsky's Turkey Club.  Like every freakin Friday.  I had to bite the bullet a few weeks back and go over on my own because my coworker who goes with me gets off work early fridays.      I have to say, the Tattoo guy and the cashier gal have redeemed themselves and this Schlotzsky's, in my eyes.  Thankfully I havent seen the other dude.    Oh, and my custom order has not been an issue which requires problem solving.    THANK GOODNESS for the redemption!  They gain 1 star from my last review.  :)"}
{"text":"The low rating is because I arrived at 7:45 on Sunday night and they informed me they were closed. Hmm. The sign on the door says you close at 8:00. I rushed to get there on time. All the guy did was shrug his shoulders and say they had no food. Everything was already cleaned up. If that's the case, they need to change their posted hours! Poor customer service."}
{"text":"I went there today (12/13/14) and had a medium Original sandwich. While it was good, it seemed a bit \"skimpy\" as far as portions go. They needed to put more meat, etc., on them. The bread was fresh and very good, but they need to load those sandwiches up with more ingredients than they are. I left there hungry. This is why I'm only giving it 3 stars...."}
{"text":"There is a man there that has the best customer service ever!! He was so sweet! The sanwiches were perfect and our kiddos were happy! Great time!! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped for food and it has been tasty so far.  But went for the pickle and sad to say but wth? Looks like someone got to it first. So sad for me and lack of a pickle."}
{"text":"Out of turkey, out of pastrami, and out of most of the fountain drink options on a Friday night at 6:30. Did someone forget to place a food and drink supply order?????"}
{"text":"The place was completely empty on this Saturday dinner hour. Service was friendly and helpful. My order was prepared quickly.   I sampled the soup that I wound up ordering. Very tasty cheddar broccoli. The chipotle chicken on sourdough was fresh and delicious. The texture of the bread was perfect. Too full to eat my Cinnabon dessert, but look forward to it soon.   How could my experience be any better? About 2 bucks less!"}
{"text":"This location is a little dated when comparing to other locations I have visited. Still same great sandwich. I absolutely love the new turkey with guacamole on sourdough."}
{"text":"We hadn't stopped at a Schlotzsky's in years.  We weren't quite sure what to order but stuck with a normal favorite of ours, the french dip on pretzel bread.  What's pretzel bread?  We didn't know but tried it anyway.  Pretzel bread is good and the sandwich along with the au jus was great.  We also ordered a bowl of chicken and dumpling soup.  I thought it was A-OK but my husband hated it.  He didn't think it tasted like good chicken broth.  Servers were 50-50.  Some were friendly and a couple others were sour.  Where's the smile and where's the attitude?  Anyway, we'd go back and try another sandwich again and maybe a different soup.  We will see."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and have always been happy with the food and service. The owners are really nice and helpful. We have never had a problem with our food. Pizzas here are delicious and I love the original sandwiches."}
{"text":"So I live down on McKellips and Val Vista I had a taste for some Schlotzsky's which is one of my favorites the only one was open was on Juanita.I called and asked  what how long they're going to be open till they told me 8 o'clock also told him I had a Groupon can I use it there they said no problem. So I get my car drive all the way over to their store and the manager Jamal, and another young man who was helping him couldn't figure out how to put the Groupon into the register so I said no problem I can wait ...after  messing with the registry for 10 minutes he told me I would have to buy some chips and a soda for him to use a Groupon I told him that's not how to use them he tells me well I don't know how to punch it in , let me call my boss he called his boss walked to the back of the store then comes back up front and say all you can't use that here even the people in line with me will flabbergasted by how it was handled I will never spend another dime here. Schlotzsky's this is like the third time I've had an issue with an adequately trained employees at this location. Great food but lousy service!  Ps. When I arrived the pizza was already made so they would rather throw away money than to honor a client that comes to see them at least 2 or 3 times a month. Lack of customer service will drive a business out of business I know I've been a business owner now for 26 years I had to learn the hard way."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches & nice people working here.  Several months ago I got home (20 minutes away) & realized that I had lost my wallet  I kept my fingers crossed that it was at Schlotzsky's & still intact & hustled back over here. I was afraid I was going to get back to no wallet or a wallet with all of my cash & my bank cards gone. LUCKILY there are still good people in the world & the great staff had my wallet with everything including a substantial amount of cash still intact!   THANKS Schlotzsky's staff for proving there are still good, honest people in the world!"}
{"text":"Don't get excited! If you're a Schlotzskys fan this location will disappoint you! I paid $16 for a small original,  a soda and a cup of soup. We dont have one where I live so I was looking forward to it. When my order was called I asked if the pickle was in the bag..I was told they were out of pickles.  I was bummed.  I sat down and ate my food and was so disappointed at the quality.  It tasted nothing like a Schlotzskys! The bread was hard, the onions were cold and raw. Just tasted off. And the soup was barely warm. I wish I hadnt wasted my money. Id skip this location."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been coming here for 20 plus years. And always a must when I'm on this side of town.   Very great service. And the food is delicious.  Always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"The Food is excellent. The customer service  is great over the phone and in the drive through. Great alternative to fast food. I will be back again. I can't wait to try their breakfast. There apple pecan cranberry salad is amazing. They have a great pick two meal for $7.99 half salad, sandwich or pizza."}
{"text":"All we can say is wow wow wow!  Quite possibly the best sandwich ever. The ham and cheese on sourdough is simply amazing.  We usually get the large sandwich and share it. And of course we always add extra cheese! We eat half of it and then put the rest in the fridge and reheat it late at night. The trick to reheating it is to wrap it in a paper towel and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Also put a cup of water in the microwave with it so it's steams and gets the sandwich nice and moist. Then take the sandwich and put it in a toaster oven and toast it so the outside of the bread crisps up. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever, the food was terrible! We got breakfast sandwiches, I ordered the egg, tomato,avocado,  bacon on rye. The egg tasted burned, there was virtually no bacon you could taste, the avocado tasted bad. My daughter had an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich which was \"...okay\". The waiter offered vegetables but couldn't tell her which vegetables. Don't go here!"}
{"text":"I ordered the santa fe chicken as a wrap and got sick a few hours later. Ate 2/3 of it before I noticed the cheese in the wrap was very questionable and I threw away the rest. My husband got a cinnamon roll which he only ate half which is unusual with him and Cinnabon items. His response was that it was \"ok, but not as good as other rolls he's eaten before.\" First and last time trying this place."}
{"text":"Don't expect New York deli. Stingy with the meat but fresh. I'm from New York so I may have high standards.  Not for me I will say that if they have soup try it. That is good"}
{"text":"I order online and they are always dead in the evening and never have it ready when I come in after the order time."}
{"text":"Impressed that management follows up!  Following my previous review, the management went out of their way to understand what the issue with the customer service, and to take corrective action.  Clearly a company that takes its customers seriously."}
{"text":"Chipotle chicken sandwich is bomb!  This is the closest location in North Scottsdale off of Shea and the 101.  It's never too busy to get a quick bite to eat here.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  I hope they stay in business because no other sandwich is made like a Schlotzky's sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place makes a good sandwich, but I feel the competition in the area just makes this spot look foolish. My gf is obsessed with Schlotzsky's so she may hate me for this 3 star review.  I had the Pastrami and Swiss which was good, just not great. I would recommend other sandwich shops in the Arcadia area that would blow Schlotzsky's out of the water. Bottom line, it's quick, it has a drive thru, has a franchise feel which takes away the local Arcadia ambiance. I will be back for a quick stop if the lady prefers but I certainly won't fly solo here."}
{"text":"A good alternative to fast food when you need something quick. A couple things that I love:   - calories listed on the menu - yummy garlicy pickles  - gluten free bread option  - baked chips - drive thru   Little something for everybody here - the kids love their little kids meals :)"}
{"text":"2 stars because I love Cinnabon.  Zero stars for customer service.  Cinnabons were sitting in the front display case freshly made.  Waited 21 minutes for the girl to move them from the display to the plate.  And that was only after we went back up to remind her that we (the only customers in store) were still waiting.  Sad that this is the only Cinnabon location left.  Drive thru is apparently more important than customers sitting in store."}
{"text":"I really love their sourdough bread. I get the veggie on sourdough and really love the taste.  Drive through line is a little long and sometimes the bread hurts the top of my mouth, but this is my favorite fast food place.  OH.. the pizza is great too! I always get cheese with jalapenos. The bread they use for the crust rules.   Indoor and outdoor seating. Staff does not speak English very well, but I have never had an issue with my order. Been there at least ten times."}
{"text":"i had my first sandwich at this chain yesterday.  i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed.  i ordered the beef provolone but asked them to use mozzarella instead.  they never told me or asked me what size i wanted and i was not sure there were different sizes.  i had a coupon for a small which i discovered later and when i went to window she had prepared the medium.  i had to wait extra time while they made another.  all the while other cars in back of me had to wait. with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected.  the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real sliced deli beef. could hardly find the mozzarella either.  only good thing was the toasted bun.  even arby's roast beef is better than this which is a real stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"This location has been here for decades.  \"The Original\" is still my favorite of the sandwiches.  Although a variety of food options have been added to the menu including Cinnabon dessert items, this place doesn't seem to advertise.  The interior desperately needs a remodel!"}
{"text":"I came in today for my first time ever although the friendliness of the cashier could have used some work the food definitely made up for it I don't think I'll ever be able to eat a sub anywhere else this is the best sandwich and the absolute best salt and vinegar chips I  have ever tasted in my entire life"}
{"text":"Messed my order up and now Bonnie which took care of me replaced it ( for Bonnie) with no questions, I just checked my order and still no extra olives and cheddar, well it is what it is. CHECK YOUR ORDER! That is all I'm saying"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich spots around. I love the sourdough bread and they also have some really good carrot cake.   Yesterday we stopped in for lunch I ordered the half turkey sandwich and half California chicken avocado pizza. The pizza was sooo good. While my daughter had a turkey sandwich kids meal with added cucumbers and tomatoes. She enjoyed all but the bread.  The customer service from the man who took my order was lacking. No real greetings.  The restaurant was pretty busy at lunch time it took about 15 minutes to get my order to the table."}
{"text":"Really great first experience. Staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. Defiantly will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit. I got the Angus beef and cheese sandwich and I thought it was great. It wasn't the best sandwich I have had, but I would definitely order it again. The customer service was also fairly good. They were able to quickly make sandwiches for me and  my party of 6."}
{"text":"Best moms & pops sandwiches in Las Vegas! Their bread is so yummy and the meat always fresh Great for a filling feel good spot!"}
{"text":"I was  very disappointed, the sandwiches was very small, it was spicy which did not indicated,  it was a chicken breast sandwich.  I wish I had gone to the pita house instead. Subway had a better chicken breast foot long and twice as big and the same price!!!"}
{"text":"First off, I wouldn't go to this place if it was dark out or if I was alone because it gives off a creepy vibe. Secondly, this is the first sandwich shop I've been to where you don't see them putting on the ingredients and they aren't listed on the menu. The sandwich I got was terrible, and the cheesecake was not worth the $3.50 we paid. But, the other sandwich was good and I feel like they have potential, so I'd be willing to try them again, just not at night."}
{"text":"Giving this a 2 star. Just left this location and we waited over 20 min for 2 kids pizza and a turkey sandwhich. The store was not busy and no one told us what was taking so long. When we got our food, there was not even a sorry about the wait. Very disappointed in this trip"}
{"text":"The family ended up here when Heidi's Deli was closed and we were in need of a quick bite.  Everyone got the Original and I grabbed a pesto chicken. There wasn't anything really remarkable with the sandwich despite the dining room being busy. The bread was nice soft and spongy inside with a crisp outside, but there wasn't much filling and a half a slice of tomato and shredded iceburg with some pesto. I threw their hot sauce on it to make it a bit better. A small was deceivingly filling, but I don't eat just be filled up.   I like that their drink fountain has 3 kinds of ice tea AND two flavors of lemonade to make some great arnold palmer concoctions. The first cup of tea just tasted old. The 2nd was a different kind and it was the same. So the 3rd cup I just did lemonade and it tasted like the plastic dispenser. WTF?   Not really feeling it."}
{"text":"Over the years, this has become a hole in the wall type of place that is getting older and older.  However, hole in the wall type of places can be fantastic and this place certainly is.  I've always loved their food. Their wisconsin cheddar cheese soup is GREAT and they make their own croutons in the restaurant (definitely better then what you find in a box)   This place may be old, but the owner does a good job keeping it clean, and service is VERY friendly.    The sandwhich I love the most is their original with extra onion.  They have great sourdough bread that they use.    Prices are very reasonable and I have eaten here for years and I always highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Good food and top notch customer service.  I have gone to this location a few times while in town for business and vacations in the past.  We just moved back to the area and decided to swing by for another visit.  The food at every Schlotzkys has always been good.  The customer service at this location is what sets it apart.  There has been a different person working for each of our visits and they were all friendly and welcoming.  Back to back good experiences."}
{"text":"This is the friendliest Schlotskys we've ever been in. Service is quick and as with all Schlotskys the food is first rate."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews on here. This is a pretty typical schlotzskys location. good fresh bread and sandwiches, clean dining area, friendly staff. Parking is easy and service is fast. Great for a lunch or quick snack."}
{"text":"The people who work here ruined this place for me. Not coming back. The sandwiches are mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Schlotzsky's. My office mate back in Rochester, MN introduced me to this fast food place years ago. The problem was that the closest one to us was in Apple Valley, an hour away and just shy of Minneapolis. We did a quick trip up there and I was in heaven.  Since then, I get excited when I see a Schlotzsky's. I bought an original sandwich on my plane ride home from Denver. This time, I was thrilled to find it in the food court at Excalibur.  I tend to get the original sandwich, which is like a kicked-up assorted sub, but much better. It has lean ham, salami, lettuce, red onion, black olives, three different cheeses, and a special sauce that is so good. I don't normally love olives, but will eat them when I get this sandwich. This detail also speaks volumes! I also love the French dip, which steers you away from salami and gives you yummy roast beef. The kicker is the pretzel bun that is perfect.  My friend was sitting down and resting her feet. I placed my order and waited patiently. I'd say about five minutes later, I got my meal. I brought it to the table and sat down to eat.  My original sandwich was yummy. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. I washed it down with a fountain drink.  I'd definitely come back to get my sandwich fix.  (180)"}
{"text":"Classic deli type food they also had pizza which I didnt know they did will be trying that soon!"}
{"text":"I'm the type of person who enjoys trying different things. When someone suggests eating sandwiches, I'd much rather try something out of the norm, rather than settling for Subway (although I don't have a problem with Subway at all!)  That being said, Schlotzsky's is NOTHING like subway, so I don't even think they're comparable. Yes, they both serve sandwiches, but subway serves mostly cold subs, while Schlotzsky's serves round, hot sandwiches that'll cause a party in your mouth with an explosion of flavors.   The only concern I have with this place is the immensity of options. I can sit there wondering what to eat for hours. The pizzas are my personal favorite, but they have this new roasted turkey sandwich with avocado that rocked my tastebuds.   I simply don't understand the previous comment complaining about avocado on a hot sandwich? It's just like any other cold vegetable that's added on a hot item. A burrito, a burger, nachos, etc. Avocado is a creamy addition that'll improve the flavor of almost any sandwich, hot or cold.   That being said, I personally love this place. I enjoy the drink selection, their original selection of chips, even their cookies! I have had one time where I went through the drive-thru and got the wrong sandwich, I would have gone back, but there wasn't anything I disliked about it like onions or olives, so I just dealt. Other than that, I've enjoyed every other time I've been there.   Yumminess at it's finest!"}
{"text":"I came here for the Cinnabon because it would appear I can get some of my favorite rolls outside of the mall finally. Being a previous Cinnabon employee, I know what a REAL cinnamon roll from Cinnabon tastes like and what to expect in the perfect roll. Sadly, the rolls here were just par-rated. I guess I expect too much from Cinnabon now, but I really wish Schlotzsky's would hire employees solely for the Cinnabon side of them so I know for certain they are made with as much love as necessary."}
{"text":"1.  Yesterday there was some kind of SNAFU down at the west side Schlotzky's.  Apparently it is not possible for the employees of this establishment to apply sliced avocado to a sandwich.  They have in their possession both guacamole and sliced avocados, but only guacamole is permitted on the sandwiches.  Rules is rules.  2.  The food was fantastic.  The iced tea was perfect.  3.  What is with the weird marketing?  I don't want to think about how Arizona schools are some of the worst in the country while I eat.  Using the \"lotz\" from the name Schlotzky's to make claims like \"lotz better\" is a cheez ball move.  Iz there some kind of connection to naming the bread \"bunz\"?  When the ownerz found out their nephew had a MySpace page, they must have hired him to re-brand their product for the internetz generation. Too bad they didn't know he waz a putz."}
{"text":"Awesome hot sandwich best in town and the only Schlotskys in town.  We have been eating here for 17 years.  They make you feel at home and like family.  The owner is the King of service.   If your seeking a casual totally satisfying meal this place is my place."}
{"text":"I had a VERY friendly young man wait on us Tuesday the 9th of April.  But our sandwiches were like ALL BREAD??!!!, and the kid agreed.  I ordered a 3rd for my wife and I with extra meat and the damn thing had hardly any meat, I mean what an insult to your intelligence.  Our bill - are you ready for this? - was $29 for 3 sandwiches and a garbage red beans and rice soup and 1 water and 1 pop.  The meat on their sandwiches could fit in your mouth in one bite.  This is not a jab at the VERY friendly employees, they were so kind and accommodating to us (and noted the 2 of 2 high chairs had non-functioning belt buckles.)  But the sandwiches were absolute insults to you, to your pocketbook.  The sauce bottles on tables were filthy.  If some other outfit would go and steal these nice employees they'd do well.  The meat portion on a sandwich would be ideal for a 2 day old sparrow in a nest that didn't like regurgitated worms, the standard meat portion would keep the 2 day old sparrow satisfied for nearly half an hour.  If we bought just $10 of lunch meat at the grocery store it would be unreal how much we'd get.  This place is a \"must-miss.\"  A MUST-MISS."}
{"text":"Love Schlotzsky's!  I stop here and eat here occasionally when I am in Gastonia.  Have never been let down!  Make sure to eat here if you have never tried! Even the personal pizzas are good! Friendly pleasant staff!"}
{"text":"If you are going to have a rewards program where you get 1 stamp per sandwich bought and at 10 you get a free one, then it should be 1 stamp per sandwich not per combo ordered. Read your card. My card is in the trash. My family will not ever eat at any branch of this place. There are thousands of sandwich shops and this is only middle of the road at best. All it takes is one little thing to cost you thousands."}
{"text":"I love Schlotzsky's sandwiches.  My wife and I ate here last night.  The guy at the cash register (Ali) was very polite and pleasant.  I got the pastrami and swiss sandwich on sourdough bread.  Very good.  The place is clean and inviting.  The only reason I knocked my rating from 5 to a 4 is that Schlotzsky's sandwiches are very expensive.  $11 for a medium sandwich, chips and a small drink is kind of expensive.  But, the food is very good."}
{"text":"I love the pastrami and swiss on a sourdough roll.  My favorite all time sandwich anywhere.  I love the spicy mustard on it.  In fact, it's the only thing I've ever ordered in the 10+ years I've eaten here.  I knock it down to 4 stars because it's a little expensive.  For a medium sandwich, chips and a small drink, it usually costs around $12."}
{"text":"I came to this place for a quick breakfast run at 9am, and I was the only customer present. It was my first time at this  restaurant and didn't know what to expect on the menu. It was sandwiches and wraps. I had the ham burrito,  which was actually really good (10 inches in length). The food took a while to cook, but that's a good thing (not preheated). The restaurant was clean and service was good. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Great food , great service, great prices, great location, to bad they no longer have one in Henderson."}
{"text":"The wait time is sooooo long at this location. The food is not that bad and actually tasty and well seasoned for healthy gourmet eating on tho go, but it is very overpriced, for 2 macs, a kids meal, and a Tucson sandwich was 34$, and that is a lot.. if you ever go To this location be prepare to at least wait 30 min in the drive thru"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I'm so glad we found another one. I had started to believe that I would never get to eat another one of their glorious sandwiches again. Thank god, I was mistaken!   It's Schlotzsky's. There's not too much to say about it, right? Yea, it's a national chain (or was), but I don't care. They make delicious sandwiches on fantastic bread. This particular one doesn't have the uniform look that I've come to know, but the food is every bit as good. The Original is just about perfection! Also, in case you were unaware, they carry their own brand of chips. With flavors like Black Pepper and Jalapeno (regular, NOT kettle!!!), they are a refreshingly addictive side...and maybe a second or third bag for homework later. They also offer a variety of baked goods and desserts, but I haven't tried any of them yet. The staff is always, ALWAYS super-friendly and helpful, too. I mean, what else can you ask for?  I am so, SO glad that there are still a few of these shops still lurking around!"}
{"text":"Schlotzsky's has breakfast now! Had to give it a try. My friend & I shared a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich and 2 breakfast tacos (one bacon, one ham-no veggies). Everything was tasty. The tacos were stuffed and very filling. The lady working was nice and filled our cups with some freshly brewed iced tea."}
{"text":"So I passed by the other day & decided it's been years so I would stop in for a sandwich.  This Schlotzsky's is in a kind of weird quiet strip mall on Bell Road.  There was hardly anyone in the restaurant at lunch time.  It took a while for anyone to notice I was at the counter.  When I finally got my order it was the same great sandwich they have always served."}
{"text":"Our cashier was extremely rude she send bother  just bye our present. Was not friendly at all. She made a mistake witch was no big deal but when I corrected her she tossed thr bag of chips at me and didint bring my whole oder out. A girl like this dose not need to be working customer seviers."}
{"text":"Worst service ever I am a routine customer I ordered the same thing every time I come a French dip I'm going up to the window they give me my food and no French dip sauce in the bag oh I'm so sorry but we're out of that well thanks for letting me know why I was ordering my food . So then I change my sandwich to a different one as I know if you wanted it the French dip because there was no juice. The other sandwich I ordered was a few dollars cheaper they were going to try to overcharge me for it. Also another thing for the rewards you can never read the number to enter for your Rewards you have to guess on a couple of the digits cuz they are not fully printed on the receipt forget trying to scan it yeah right"}
{"text":"Broccoli cheddar soup is to die for ! Albuquerque sandwich is the best,  clean restaurant and they just upgraded the soda machines"}
{"text":"NEVER eat here if there is no owner on site. When an owner is there it's great food. When there is no owner it is room temperature or cold ( both soup and sandwiches ). I have been there alot and every time no owner is there it's horrible."}
{"text":"The food was great as usual. I love me some Schlotsky's sourdough sandwiches.   The staff was friendly enough.  BUT... The bathrooms were pretty disappointing, though! It's not that they weren't well-stocked. The toliet seats were clean, but the bathroom in general was old, disgusting, and out-of-shape. Update this, and we are looking at 4 stars from me.  Nice location, though. Right next to a nice mall in Vegas.  Review #210"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are a pretty great alternative to some other fast food options. They are a great size and really filling. I stick with the original, but I have enjoyed some of the other options as well as the pizza! I'm a big fan of the chips they make too. Nice and quick place to stop in for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Obsessed!!  You must get the original sandwich. It is the reason why this place is so amazing. The bread and all the fixings are perfect together. I've been coming to Schlotzsky's around the valley since I was a small child and have surprisingly only eaten the original sandwich but that's all I want or anyone needs."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best sandwiches in the world. I've been going here for 20+ years and it never changes."}
{"text":"I visited this Schlotzsky's and ordered a Garden Salad and a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. The Philly cheesesteak was cold and tasted fake. I Ended up vomiting immediately afterwards. To make things worse there was a rude, abrasive, angry, old, bitter cashier lady who displayed terrible customer service. I personally would never recommend eating here and avoiding at all cost!!!"}
{"text":"I have found a single sandwich/salad combo that I love and cannot keep away! A tad more expensive than fast food for sure, but the higher quality and flavor are definitely fair trade. Delivery is quick, and ordering is easy, I just wish there were more alternatives to choose from."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim as I was passing through and I was hungry. Went inside and the cashier was friendly and explained their specialties. I was excited that they had a 2 for $10 special you could mix salads, soips, sandwiches or have 2 of the same thing which I thought was awesome. Absolutely delicious and definitely coming back. What's great is that they also have a drive through. Perfect if you have to stop and go. Thank you"}
{"text":"The store really drops the ball. Balsamic vinegar makes the sandwiches and this store carries none. The sandwiches are mediocre without the schlotzkys sauces and since this store does not stock them it should be avoided."}
{"text":"No. I have a problem here every time my boyfriend convinces me to give it another try. Last time I ordered a pizza to avoid another disappointing sandwich and it had no sauce on it. Not because it wasn't supposed to but because they forgot??? It tasted like cardboard. Disgusting. The time before that I asked for a cold turkey sandwich on ciabatta with lettuce. They made it hot. I can't stand HOT lettuce. Eew. Three strikes and Schlotsky's is out. I'll get a cinnamon roll.....maybe, but nothing else. Ever. Again."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!! Been here many times and always great! The app is super user friendly! Totally affordable and awesome! Will miss this place when I move...  P.S it has Cinnabon!!!"}
{"text":"Had been craving a bagel with egg and came here...total regret $7 for a plain bagel with cheese and \"roasted veggies\". Bagel was soggy and the egg and veggies, flavor less. Should have gone outside of the casino for something else because the food here is not good"}
{"text":"My wife and I were here today for probably the 400th time.  Come here at least twice a month without fail.  Never thought to post a Yelp for whatever reason until now.  The owner came by our table, as he usually does as he makes the rounds and checks on the patrons.  He happened to mention how there were a couple reviews that were really bad and how disappointed he was that someone would have had such a bad experience.  By the number of visits, its easy to tell we really like the place.  The staff is super friendly and the food is always good. From the pizza to the sandwiches to the soup to the fresh baked cookies, we've tried it all and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Sandwiches that can become a salad. This place is a good surprise, meaning, I haven't been here in a very long time, so I decided to stop for a salad.   I can say that it turned out to be a good choice. Fresh, made on the spot, thin turkey stips, good mix of greens, crispy bacon, egg, tomato and avocada in bite size pieces. Overall, a good salad!"}
{"text":"I got the Tuscan sandwich and some Center of the rolls.  The sandwich was really good, just a little messy.  But the center of the roll is supposed to be soft and warm. Mine was barely warm enough to feel and they were hard and chewy.   Besides that it was pretty good."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot because its so close to our house, but we also love the sandwiches and the employees. Gita and Tim are so friendly and always remember us. you can save money by filling out the survey at the end of your receipt"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative 5 star rating I would! Schlotzsky's has always been a family tradition and we bring their food home to California for the whole family. The food has always been amazing, of course we had never tried this location. The management and service was so terrible. They give Schlotzsky's a bad name. They messed up on our order 3 separate times. On our way back to California we stopped in Barstow and quadruple checked our order and noticed that they had messed up again.  First off, I don't believe that anyone should have to check their order even once. However, my fiance and I always check at least once. By the third time I think any competent person should have gotten the order right. Fortunately I will give one manager Bahmin props he did refund us for one sandwich that was never given to us. Although I do believe him asking for a picture of my fiance's credit card was extremely unethical. They should have been able to refund the card without images of both sides of the card.   Basically to sum it all up I would die before eating at this location again."}
{"text":"Never had food from here before, ordered a Swiss and pastrami, it was delicious.  Service was great, they bring the food to you after you order.  Selection is great, love the pictures of the sandwiches they have, they make you want to order everything.  Taste was great but a lot of salt involved into its making so be careful of that.  Clean nice courteous can't ask for any better!  Thank you A+   Forgot to mention $2 for a drink and $2 for a bag of ships, that's $4 add on to make it a combo."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a Cinnabon and was very disappointed. I ordered 2 cinnabons, and I was the only person in the store. The ones I ordered were already made in the display, they just had to box them up. Took over 15 minutes to finally give me my order even though there was 4 workers there doing nothing. The cinnabons tasted old & stale. If I wanted a cinnamon roll like this I would have just gone to burger kind for a 1/4 of the price. Definitely not worth it. Would not go back nor recommend"}
{"text":"This place has amazing sandwiches and well worth trying. Their Turkey Bacon Club and Chicken Bacon Smokecheesy were great with of course their jalapeño cheddar buns. Only wish they had a restaurant closer to DTLA."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my salad. I should have ordered a sandwich, but I thought a salad sounded healthier. I only took a few bites and ended up skipping lunch. Meh is right."}
{"text":"We used to have this deli in the Chicago  Suburbs....oh do we miss it! Got a chicken and pesto gluten free Pizza while on vacation! !!!Fantastic! I wasn't eating GF when the deli was in my area......sure do miss the food.  Delish!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at Schlotzky's all the time when I lived in Mesa, so I was happy to find one on this side of town when I moved here.  I eat here at least once a week.  The food is fresh and wonderful.  If you've never had their signature bread (sandwich buns or pizza crust) it's amazing - just like I remember it.  The staff is always friendly and even knows my name now.  It's clean in the diningroom and restroom, also - which is very important.  I'd highly recommend them to anyone wanting a nice change of pace from the typical fast-food experience."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time I got a medium reuben on sourdough. It was very good but seriously so big I couldn't finish it. I had also gotten a coffee which was meh. The second time I got a small reuben on rye and the sandwich was still good and very large for a small. The service here has always been quick and kind and if I am ever in the area again will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My first time at a Schlotzsky's Deli and they got my order wrong.  The food isn't bad, but nothing special either. (3-star, go figure) I Will probably try it again due to the convenience of the location alone, and because the price is decent."}
{"text":"I can understand why this location has such bad reviews. I waited for 10 min for anyone to check us out at the front. My husband waited at the counter as I had to go around to the kitchen to get someone to help us. Monica was the girl who checked us out, didn't make any eye contact and completely ignored that we were waiting for 10 minutes to be helped. If you are not going to be in the front please put a bell to save everyone some time thank you."}
{"text":"Surprisingly I haven't been into a Schlotzsky's in over 10 years.  I was with my dad in the area and we were looking for something quick for lunch so we stopped in.  I can say this, Jason was amazing, very friendly and humored my father by laughing at his jokes.    We both ordered medium Turkey Bacon Clubs on sourdough.  The sandwiches were delicious, and the medium was a huge portion.    Bottom line, I have to start going into Schlotzsky's more often, not a bad sandwich."}
{"text":"I LOVE SCHLOTZKYS!    There, I said it.  I don't know why these don't outnumber Quizno's and Subway. The bread and bread choices kick butt.  Can you get sourdough at those places?  How 'bout dark rye bread?  Any rye bread?  NO!  I try and stop by this or any Schlotzky's every chance I get.  I just wish there was one closer to my house (Arrowhead)."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have got a moldy salad from this location. The onions are rotten. Shame on you guys for even putting it in the box. The sliminess on this is a build up of bacteria and can get you very sick. Very unsafe to eat!"}
{"text":"My visit to this location was downright frustrating today. Their registers are so old that it prevents them from keeping track of orders properly. I ordered a sandwich for my husband and soup for myself and then paid. They only gave me the sandwich and when I questioned them about it they told me it never got ordered. I just left in frustration. My husband did enjoy his sandwich but a two item order should not be hard to accomplish."}
{"text":"I have had a number of great experiences here but I do think it's because the manager on duty is on his A game.  He is fast and courteous and seems to really appreciate my business. I love the classic smoked turkey sandwich and a small is only about 300 calories. The other employees were all busy doing something even though it was slow which tells me they really care about this business.  Will return often!"}
{"text":"I have had a number of great experiences here especially when a very friendly man is working the drive thru window. He is fast and courteous and seems to really appreciate my business. I love the classic smoked turkey sandwich and a small is only about 300 calories. Will return often!"}
{"text":"Please read full review! My boyfriend and I normally love to go to the location on bell but that is 12 miles away, so we decided to try the closer location on 90th street. BIG Mistake! We ordered what we always do, a grilled chicken and pesto pizza and a BBQ pizza with roasted tomatoes. Fist off the gentleman working the drive through Appeared to be intoxicated. He Asked for our order 4 times then another 3 wail we were waiting at the window. When we asked him to repeat the order before we paid he still has no idea what we had ordered. Again we had to ask for our drinks before driving away were the gentleman mentioned that the drinks there needed some adult drinks added to them. Secondly, we over herd the cooks saying to use the flatbread, we figured it was for some other order. Sadly when we go home we saw that our 14' pizzas had been made out of a small round cut flatbread. Very disappointed, one we paid almost 40 $ for our meal, and to have a small pizza made with flat bread was not okay. The pizza has few toppings due to the fact that there was no crust to hold in all the ingredients and the undercooked chewy flatbread was underwhelming. Also the roasted tomatoes we had added to the BBQ pizza were scares to none. Our whole meal was definitely not worth the drive or money. However we normally do enjoy Schlotzskys so the next day I called up the stores manager Memo who apologized for the inconvenience and offered to buy our next meal if we return. I am not sure if we ever will return to this location, but it's nice to see the effort put forth to correct the mistakes made."}
{"text":"The worst place I have ever been to. I have always loved cinnabon and I finally found one by my house . I ordered one and they put it in the microwave I can only imagine how old it was . It was so disgusting and hard and crunchy. I ordered a ice cream cone as well and the picture on the menu showed the biggest ice cream cone I have ever seen and I ordered it and paid $4 for it and the lady hands me one of the smallest cones I have ever seen. And I paid $4 for this! I was so distraught and I asked for a bigger one and she literally dumped the old one into a new cone and then added maybe a half inch more ice cream. I am so upset false advertising at its finest. On top of that they were the rudest girls I have ever met. Will never be back and I will be contacting corporate."}
{"text":"Where is the pride of ownership?  My last review was not glowing.  I haven't been back.  The signs have been broken for over a year.  Every time I drive it it looks like slumsville.   Fix the damn lights.  If an owner cares so little about his store that he can't fix the lights what else is he not fixing that may affect food output?"}
{"text":"This is the only place to get Schlotzsky's so regardless of the lackluster dining experience  - I will be back.  I love the original.  The warm sourdough type bread with the warm ham... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm good.   This place is old and run down.  The service sucks.  But if you want some Schlotzcky's this is it!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of hot sandwiches but this place is the exception. I've been hooked on them since I was a teenage in California but the one in my hometown closed. When I move to NC I was pleasantly surprised when they had one in the middle of nowhere town I was living in. And now I'm in Vegas and this place still hits the spot. I get the original (with turkey instead of ham) and you can't go wrong. The baked BBQ chips are good and they serve Southern sweet tea (no quite as Southern as I'm use to since I've lived in NC and they're serious about tea over there) but it's still good. The owners (this is a franchise) are so nice and so was the rest of the staff. I'm not a fast foodie but this place is too good to pass up."}
{"text":"I'm so torn about this place! I went in for my very first Schlotsky's visit to grab takeout for me and my other half. OMG was it good! I got the fiesta chicken sandwich without the olives and then added avocado. So amazing. It has chipotle mayo, which gives it some kick.   But then a couple days later I went in to get my exact same order. Not only did they forget the avocado, but the chicken was different. The first time it was grilled, the second time it was deli sliced. Make up your mind! My guy wound up getting a really bad tummy ache in the middle of the night hours after eating his pastrami reuben. Normally I wouldn't blame the establishment, but we both worked all day and aside from black coffee, those sandwiches were the only food we put in our mouths all day.  Sadly this last experience left bad impressions on both of us. It'll probably be a while until we go back."}
{"text":"The Original Regular vs Original Deluxe.? For $2.00 alot more meat.I could not finish. Very good."}
{"text":"We frequent this store a lot. Last night, we had dinner there. Alyssa was our cashier. Either she was mad she had to work on Valentine's Day, or just hates her job. She had a TERRIBLE attitude.  At one point, she threw her headset down. Not a good thing for a customer to see.  The dining room music was so loud, I thought I was in a bar. Our group couldn't hear each other talk. When my food came out, brought out by Miss Congeniality, we asked her to turn it down. She didn't.  One of our party went to the restroom and said the music was even louder in there. He also said he had to fan the cigarette smoke it was so heavy. I still love the food there, but between attitude and blaring music, I would be hard pressed to go back. This was the first time we had bad service there. Fix It Please. We love the food."}
{"text":"I was so grossed out eating here! The entire place was dirty... They're doing some remodeling, but no excuse! The drink area was gross, most of the tables were dirty, the cashier obviously hates her job... I very rarely write a bad review but I wanted someone else to be warned before they come to this restaurant!! They need someone from corporate to come evaluate it and clean it up! Even the bathroom was worse than a ghetto gas station. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I have been a customer at numerous Schlotzsky's locations throughout the valley.  Prior to this experience I would have rated them overall as a 4.  At this particular location I experienced dirty conditions in the dining room and bathroom, an incorrect order, slow service and incompetent counter staff.  Fortunately the sandwich was still tasty and I discovered the order mistake before leaving.  I would skip this location."}
{"text":"Tonight we decided to have Schlotzsky's take out.  Usually it's good. Tonight, not so much. We had one sandwich (out of six items) that was not great--smoked turkey breast on Sourdough. This sandwich had no lettuce and no mayo.  At the prices here, we have come to expect more. Also, there was only one slice of tomato. I just hope they pay a little more attention to detail in the future. One more thing, we got three Caesar salads with one Caesar dressing and two ranch. Just not what we've come to expect."}
{"text":"The service is good, food is great, place is clean. My three stars is because they close at 8 but wouldn't serve me a salad at 7:30 because its \"too close to closing\"?? Why would I not be able to order something so simple 30 minutes before closing?"}
{"text":"Wow what a gem of a quick eats place!  I recently visited this deli and was pleasantly surprised.   The quality of the food was great. Bread was fresh and flavored very well. Meats were tastey, as they should be for a deli. Price was great and a value for the quality.  Staff was very friendly as well.   This location also has both outdoor seating and a drive through. Score for all you dog lovers out there!  I will be back to visit this location again.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Yum. Love Schlotzskys.  This location was good.  Clean, quiet, and prompt service.  No complaints."}
{"text":"This place is one of the few places two franchises come together s one.  The food prep was quick, efficient, and the staffs are friendly.  It is what you will get at other locations where the food and service is consistent, reliable, and efficient."}
{"text":"Can't believe this is one of the only ones in town. I love Schotzsky's wish the one in Henderson would have been in a better location, so I wouldn't have to drive across town for this but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Rarely eat fast food but wanted something I could drive thru since having had foot surgery.  No waiting and the service was fine but the Smoked Turkey sandwich I had very, very little meat and whole wheat bun was hard.  I remember when Scholzsky's made a great sandwich with just the right amount of meat.  What happened?  Really wanted a tasty turkey sandwich but didn't have.  My husband had the Original and felt the same way.  No wonder I rarely do fast food - can make a much better sandwich at home."}
{"text":"Typical chain but inconsistent.  When I asked if they charge extra for jalapeños they said yes.  I didn't order jalapeños but found out afterward that they charge for a water cup.  I even mentioned the charge to a guy who seemed to be the owner who said but the water is free.  Smart ass.    I am learning the hard way at these places.  Been a Schlotzsky's fan for years but they are inconsistent and appear to be money grubbing.  Will reconsider eating there ever again after using up the dam* gift cards in my wallet.  Banh mi sandwiches are much better anyway and wish I would have gone that way."}
{"text":"Just waited 30 minutes in the drive through. No kidding!! We were stuck and there was nothing we could do. Horrible experience. On top of all that I paid $27 for two large sandwiches and a Cinnabon!! Crazy!! It used to be my favorite place for lunch, what a disappointment"}
{"text":"After visiting three places for breakfast on a Sunday morning---Matt's Big Breakfast, Coffee Conspiracy, and IHOP near ASU Tempe---and finding ourselves looking at serpentine queues at two places, and finding Coffee C. closed, we finally came to Schlotzsky's...for no particular reason, other than that it was open, and looked empty!   The interior is big...with both high chairs and regular tables. I got the Texas Schlotzsky's on sourdough bread. It had ham and melted cheddar cheese with mayonnaise, sliced jalapenos, lettuce and tomato. Partner got the ribeye sandwich. We made both the orders combo deals, with a side of chips and a drink. I liked partner's sandwich more than mine...it just had more taste and character than mine. My sandwich was just a regular lettuce, tomato ham sandwich that you could have bought for slightly less at a Subway, or even tossed up at home.   But I'll definitely be back to try the Reuben....I hear that's the thing to order here.  One thing: on a bright beautiful morning like today, we would have liked to sit outside in the sun, but we couldn't, because the patio wasn't open. What a waste!"}
{"text":"Schlotzsky's is WONDERFUL!  As far as I know, this is the only location in town. I can't really understand why because they're everywhere in Texas and Arizona. One would think a Strip location here would do very well.  Everything here is GOOD, but I always stick with the ORIGINAL! Generous portions of meat and cheese, fresh lettuce and olives...YUM!  Of course, it's the bread that makes Schlotzsky's stand out as the KING. Oh, they fresh bake their own bread and it's oh so chewy and GOOD.   When I want a sandwich and Subway is only a block away, I'll gladly drive 30 minutes for my Schlotzsky's...it's a NO BRAINER!"}
{"text":"Uber eats messed up my order and this place went above and beyond to try and fix it. Uber eats was no help at all and should be embarrassed but Schlotzsky's did a great job and was very helpful and polite. Thank you to the lady and the manager offering to help. For that reason I decided to let the situation go enjoy some good food!"}
{"text":"Love It!!! Clean & fresh!!! Kid's pizza had a lot of flavor & not greasy. Sandwiches are soooo good. Best I've had in a very very long time!"}
{"text":"I have missed Schlotzsky's and was so excited when I saw the sign for it along I-85. I've been eating their sandwiches for 20+ years & in 4 different states but for the last 7 years I haven't lived near a Schlotzsky's. This location is an hour drive from my home but I'll have to find a reason to travel here more often. I get the Fresh Veggie on Jalapeño Cheese bread. They have made one change to the sandwich - they've added fat free spicy ranch dressing. Being fat free it's very sweet so next time I'll have it the old way with mayo & mustard. Their bread is so unique & delicious. Lots of sandwich, soup, salad & pizza options. This store has joined forces with Cinnabon which is a great idea. It made my day to stumble on this treasure. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru today and when I got to my office my order was all wrong.  I called and talked to the manager, Alex.  I thought, \"they won't do anything, they won't care\", however Alex blew me away.  Not only did he apologize, he offered to correct the order and DELIVER it to me AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE!  When it arrived, he'd added a Cinnabon as a bonus.  Thank you, Alex.  Thank you Schlotzsky's.  In a world where there is a lot of focus on the negative, you gave a big POSITIVE to me today.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"A soup kind of day. Broccoli cheese soup Hit the spot. Along with a sourdough turkey club it was perfect"}
{"text":"How sad first it began with winter hours which was odd since winter is nearly over, today how sad to see CLOSED for winter all over the glass.  Shame, really enjoyed the food here, will be surprised if they reopen.  The prices were kind of high but the food was good."}
{"text":"Great customer. Michael, our order taker, was very attentive and got our order correct. Our food was brought to our table with napkins. Excellent service and the food is consistently good. Great job and highly recommended. I have gave 4 starts because one order was questioned and the cook was defensive in her response. Other than that. Good."}
{"text":"Man this place is good! I got a beef and cheese on sourdough. I ordered a medium, but holy cow it can feed 2 people! I'm very picky about roast beef, and I theirs is excellent. I can't wait to take my sons and hubby! The only issue I had was the very low clearance in the drive thru. I have a super big conversion van. They really don't need it, and it was a little annoying until I noticed I could sneak past ;) I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich place in Arizona. I have tried almost every sandwich on the menu and they all have been mediocre at best. The other issue I have with Schlotzsky's is that their menu does provide any description of what is on the sandwich. I'm not talking about the roast beef or turkey sandwiches. I'm talking about the signature sandwiches. This is especially bad for those that have food allergies. Could the customer ask, sure, but with someone taking your order who really does not care and is unfriendly, it becomes difficult to  ask. I cannot give less than the one star. Overall piss poor."}
{"text":"I seriously thought that Schlotzsky's had gone completely out of business. I had not seen one in about a decade. We happened upon this location yesterday and were in need of a quick bite. Clean, fast, efficient, friendly, helpful, and utterly tasty! We shared a large (very large!) turkey and guacamole sammie. Smoky turkey, loads of lettuce and tomato and guacamole within the confines of a toasted round sourdough bun. The bread is pure heaven! It was almost muffalatta in nature. We were both pleasantly surprised and will now remember this locale and come back again."}
{"text":"I tried to purchase a box of cinnamon rolls for a get-together this morning. The drive-thru menu board shows a variety of types of rolls--regular, mini, bite-sized and middles. It shows the prices for only singles. Woman on speaker acted so annoyed and put upon at my questions (all of three...  what's the size difference between mini and bite-sized, what size multi-packs do they have, and the cost for one of the multi packs), I left and picked up stuff from Chompies. (Btw-- they no longer carry all those sizes/types listed on the board. Only reg and mini.)"}
{"text":"Cinnabon at this location is supposed to open at 7:00 am. At 7:05 we noticed a worker looking at us then duck back to hide thinking we didn't see him. Lost out on a Friday order of a dozen cinnamon rolls for a staff meeting and any other meetings!"}
{"text":"We went there this evening. The place was pretty empty, just a few other people there. We got a turkey bacon club and a turkey avocado sandwich on sourdough. The service was fast and very helpful. We really enjoyed the food and Schlotzskys is great food for the money! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Took 3 times to get bread right, sandwich bread was hard, asked for no mayo it they still did it. Cashier had no idea what he was talking about."}
{"text":"Husband did not want homemade Pozole for dinner, he and the kid wanted a sandwich. Cruised through the drive thru on a Friday evening. Only car in the drive.  Immediately greeted by the speaker asking \"can I take your order?\" A large original double meat, extra onion, no tomato or olives on jalapeño cheese bread. A kids ham and cheese with a Sprite and a sugar cookie.  We pull up to the window and pay our $14.03 and wait. And wait. And wait. Did I mention how long we waited? It literally took 15 minutes to get our order. A gentleman came to the window and said he was sorry but it would just be another minute.  They said the food was good and my son ate all of his sandwich.   Customer service reps that we came in contact with were all pleasant but did it really have to take that long for 2 sandwiches? My husband loves this place and it's on his regular fast food craving rotation.  But if you are in a hurry I suggest you drive on by because you will wait for your meal."}
{"text":"This place looked like it was going to be a great option for breakfast, as there were very few options at the Excalibur. The line was long, and the food looked fresh.   When we paid $6 for a breakfast burrito, I expected it to have substance, since all the other items on the menu were cheaper.    I was incredibly dissapointed. This burrito is probably the smallest burrito I have ever had. Even the Starbucks Spinach Feta Wrap is more substantial.   Very unfortunate. If you are hungry, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love scholtzky's but after the experience j just had, I doubt I'll go back to this particular location.  I shoulda known the food was gonna be awful when I saw a huge ass roach on the side of the building.  Yuck.  I get home take a bite out of my sandwich and there was the most disgusting after taste.  I don't know if they didn't change or clean the surface that they cook everything on but my that's my guess.  I wanted to take it back but by the time I would get there they would have been closed.  I plan on letting management know my experience.  It was disappointing because I was really hungry and had to throw everything away.  Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Funny name. Serious sandwich. If you've never tried Schlotzsky's unique sandwiches before, you're in for a sandwich unlike any you've tried before. Not necessarily the best you'll ever have but definitely delicious primarily because of the proprietary, round, sourdough bread  that envelops the filling. Warm, fluffy, and resembling the moon's crater-filled acne, the bread is enhanced by a unique combo of ingredients plus a nice 'spicy' ranch sauce drizzled on top of your fillings. One bite wonder.  Liberally soak your sandwich in the 'cajun' Schlotzsky's hot sauce (not spicy at all fyi) til your sandwich starts resembling a taco and be prepared to experience taste bud bliss.  The pizzas are also VERY good. Surprising but true. The veggie is very tasty. Drizzle that sauce, baby!  The Vegas location isn't pretty by any means but considering there are no Schlotzsky's Delis in NorCal anymore, I'll deal with it.  **Tip: they deliver within a 3 mile radius of West Charleston Blvd. in Vegas.**  Brought a buddy here and he was instantly hooked on The Original."}
{"text":"The following is a letter sent to Schlotzsky's Corporate.   Food and Beverage staffing is hard. You search for the right people who can deliver on your brand and messaging intentions and if they are great at their job they often don't stay too long before they are poached for greener pastures.  During my visit my family were helped by a young woman who may have been of Latino decent. I did not make note of her name which is regrettable, but I can tell you that we dined in, for breakfast, probably before 10AM in October.  This employee was very friendly and patient as we weighed our options. Not just friendly, chipper. Which denotes more of an attitude selection on her part, not necessarily a command on your part. She seemed to be working all alone and was busily preparing a large to go order when we arrived. Despite how busy she was, she slowed down to take our order, discuss the menu and then prepare our food. Your front-line leaders know their staff members, and I would be surprised if this individual does not already stick out amongst her peers.  Our little family in Tempe are foodies in every sense of the word. We try new restaurants frequently and prepare meals at home for each other typically sampling new dishes. Additionally, my girlfriend and I have a background in food and beverage and know a thing or two about your business and have this advice to offer.  Figure out who this employee is and single her out. Raise her pay and make her instrumental in selecting and training future employees. Keep her as long as you can.  The breakfast you offered was good. It could be improved in a couple of ways but overall it is better than many of your competitors. The coupling of Cinnabon's brand is a nice touch and your sandwiches aren't bad either. This is hard combo to beat in Tempe. Believe me we have and continue to try. The drink choices were a nice touch but you could be a bit more inventive with the creamers offered for your coffee. I don't think you need to go full Starbucks here as there already is saturation in the market but you could offer a few different, better creamers at little risk to your overall model.  The facility itself was very clean, well-appointed and comfortable. Obviously, your investment here is being well cared for by your in state leadership.  As a consumer, one of the highest honors I can award you is my continued patronage which you have as we will visit again soon. But I also have the ability to spread news of my encounter digitally using Yelp.  For making a good hiring decision with this employee who tragically is going un-named I will also be posting this review to Yelp along with a 4 star rating. Your breakfast exceeds the offerings from fast food vendors in the area and competes rather well with the likes of Einsteins and Paradise without the same price tag. I do hope the word gets out and you are rewarded with growth.  See you around."}
