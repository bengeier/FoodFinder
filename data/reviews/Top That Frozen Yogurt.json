{"text":"I cannot give any stars . My business was turned away tonight at 854pm. I stopped in to buy some yogurt . Sign said open . Door was open with lots of people inside eating and paying . I went to obtain a cup and just as I was about to get some yogurt  a teen behind the counter poked her head around the corner and told me they were closed and the machines were turned off so I had to leave with everyone else still inside . Very very bad customer service . I thought this place was open until nine ????"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Walked in at 8:30 the teen girl was cleaning the glass and we asked for some taster cups. She said they were in the back. So she kept cleaning and I asked again and she said she had to get them for us. She was holding a cleaning rag just seconds earlier and then never washed her hands before getting the cups. Then I reached out my hand and she wouldn't hand over the taster cups. Said she had to do it. I'm like what? Then I pointed out she never washed her hands, so I said please wash your hands and get us new cups. She goes in back and tells some guy I was yelling at her. She comes back out with the same cups. We walked out. They didn't have many choices either. Don't waste your time. Go to Yogurtini over in Norterra by harkins. They have a wide variety of choices!!! And they allow you to do your own taster cups. I've never had someone standing behind me waiting for me to pick and choose, really???"}
{"text":"We stopped in here because of their advertised happy hour special: 25% off between 2-5 pm. As anybody that goes to these yogurt shops knows, you can easily get carried away with yogurt and toppings and end up paying a ton of money. Having an extra 25% off is a huge deal!  It is set up like most other shops, with numerous yogurt dispensers, followed by toppings and sauces at the end. The dispensers are in pairs, allowing you to get one flavor, or mix two. The flavor pairs tend to complement each other, i.e., green apple and caramel, so the mix is probably going to taste pretty good. You can, of course, mix and match any flavors and get as much as you want. I've been to a few other shops with more flavor options, but the selection here will be perfectly adequate for just about everybody.  Once you've picked your yogurt you can move on to the toppings. The topping bar, like other shops, has a mind-boggling amount of options. There is everything from basic sprinkles to gummy worms and frosted animal crackers. We usually end up with brownie bites and/or cookie dough bites. I think there are some healthier topping options, too, but who wants those?!You may be tempted to go crazy with the toppings, and the shop definitely wants you to. Exercise caution, though, because the weight will add up quick and result in a hefty bill when you check out. After the toppings there are various sauces (chocolate, caramel, marshmallow, etc.) to finish off your masterpiece.  The employees were very helpful and kept the tables clean, which is important at a dessert shop frequented by kids. One complaint I have is that the seating inside is pretty limited. They have a nice, big patio, which is probably nice at night, but too hot to sit on when it's 106 outside. They also could use some shades on the windows, as the afternoon sun even made one of the inside tables too uncomfortable to sit at.  Overall, we we're impressed by Top That and will definitely return...especially to take advantage of that great happy hour special!"}
{"text":"They have several gluten free flavors, but not a lot of flavor options in general. The ones they do have are always great though! Plenty of toppings, always clean and the staff is very friendly! Every time we go in there the team members greet us with a smile."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Great two young men working, very nice. Yogurt was great too. 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Great local place!! The place is always very clean. Everytime we've been in there they are cleaning. It sparkles. The kids that are working are always very friendly. The yogurt is great. There are lots of flavors"}
{"text":"Great local place! The kids working there are so nice & helpful. The place is clean, plenty of seating & an array of toppings to choose from."}
{"text":"We were in the area and this was a new yogurt place for us, so we decided to try it...for research purposes, of course!  Overall, it is really good. The yogurt has good flavor. I tried the Island Banana and Milk Chocolate. They have a good selection of toppings, including some that might be considered a little healthier (e.g., low-fat, non-fat).  The price seems comparable to other yogurt places.  The only addition I would make is that it would be great if they had access to complimentary water. That seems to be something that has left ice cream and yogurt shops. I get that they make money by selling $1 bottles of water. It just seems like you would have better customer service if you just gave water to your customers."}
{"text":"You can sample any froyo flavor... Just ask!   This is basically like yogurtology, just a different name, and I think under different ownership. You can't go wrong with froyo!!!"}
{"text":"This little place is very clean, and the staff is kind and helpful. For occasional ice cream treats with kids, this is a gem."}
{"text":"Ehhh, YogurtLand is cheaper, has more options, and better spoons. We will not be back. Oh, and it was super awkward cause they supervisor you like you are stealing yogurt in your back pockets.  *UPDATE* I am now getting rude messages for my review  telling me, \"go back to the trailer park.\" So, I changed my review to one star. My experience was not great. And if the people who fight for this business say things like that it is not a place I would ever go back to.   If being followed from machine to machine when we are the only people in the store is about cleanliness, I guess that is what you have to do. But, it is a hard pass for me."}
{"text":"I'm really dig'n this frozen yogurt shop. It's always clean and the design is very cool in light green, white, orange and browns. It's streamlined and I'm relaxed as I step in and its a welcoming place that makes me feel welcome and not rushed to leave.  I enjoy the various and unique flavors they have.  However, I can never pull away from the original tart flavor.    A special thank you to Rep: (Derrick) of Top That he is awesome! He is friendly, helpful, has a wonderful cheer and presence and he works with pride at this place. He was working hard with cleaning, stocking and is very cordial with customers while working independently.  I've been here several times and this was my first experience with Derrick and it was a pleasurable one. I'm a regular as long as employees like Derrick are here.  Funny thing I don't live as close to this place as I do to Razzleberriez, but I'm not a fan of that place at all. Customer service and quality of the yogurt isn't like that of Top That!    :)"}
{"text":"Froyo, froyo... Where art thou froyo?   At Top That!   The cake batter is a favorite of mine! My usual is cake batter, with cheesecake bites, strawberries, some hot fudge, sprinkles, and almonds. Everything is either fat free, low or no sugar, and still delicious. Sometimes they have red velvet cake that is so delish! They let you try any ice cream, just ask for a sample cup. They have a vast array of toppings from mochi and bursting boba, gummy bears, crushed oreo, cheesecake bites, brownie bites, confetti cake bites, fruit and nuts, to sprinkles and hot fudge.  The customer service is always great. They always ask me first if I want a receipt or not. Very clean place, no restroom that I can tell. For a warm day, they have a shaded patio with misters. A must try!  Oh and PS: Make sure you give them your phone number whether they ask or not! If you do, they'll give you a free ice cream after so many ice creams you buy! It's their rewards program :)"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for the whole family!   The location used to be called a different name. The new and improved frozen yogurt joint is awesome! Very well organized and clean. There are also plenty of seating inside and outside. I know these yogurt places usually lack on the seating, however this one doesn't As I've notice.   They have many flavor selections of frozen yogurt. I really like the cooked marshmallow and the coffee flavors. Once you've selection your choice of yogurt there are a plethora of toppings to throw on. I mean they must have thought of everything for toppings! I put some white chocolate chips, mini Reese's pieces on mine. My 5 year old daughter went a little over board with the toppings. Haha clearly her eye were bigger than her stomach!   For three cups of frozen yogurt with many topping the tab was under $10 that's impressive in my book!   This place is definitely going to benefit from my repeat, repeat, repeat business. If you haven't had a chance to visit this place I highly recommend it! Bring the little ones too they will have a blast!"}
{"text":"Sweets are my guilty pleasure. This place is never busy and service is good. They always offer samples and are changing out flavors to the seasons. They usually have about 12 flavors to choose from and then over 30 toppings.   My favorite is the classic cake batter frozen yogurt. It's good with fruit and also love the cheesecake bites and cookie dough. I always tend to over do it! Depending on all the toppings the price can add up quick."}
{"text":"The frozen yogurt at Top That was pretty good, but the staff was exceptional. The tall young man with gorgeous blonde hair at the counter had a smile that lit up the room. His professionalism and friendly personality will definitely keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Great flavors, best consistency, kept clean, friendly staff! Even though it changed names/ownership still my favorite yogurt in the valley."}
{"text":"This little shop is clean and well stocked. There is plenty of seating both indoors and out for all the treat seeking customers to take their time enjoying the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is our favorite yogurt place.  So many topping selections and they always offer a sugar free menu.  You can buy by the cup to take home too. The staff are eager to assist you,  and the place is super clean at all times.  It's a light,  patron friendly atmosphere.  We live close by and sure didn't think a diamond experience would be tucked away in our shopping center. Come by and taste the experience.   Best regards"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Frozen yogurt place.. Why do these places always look like hospitals or doctor's offices on the inside?  So much white.  There are some flavors of frozen yogurt and some toppings. They don't have the old oatmeal cookie which was the best ever.  But they do have chocolate chip cookie which is pretty good."}
