{"text":"Ate the salmon with asparagus, absolutely love it. My staff ate there and recommended the chicken wrap so that's next for me. Very friendly owner and customer service at the counter was 2 thumbs up for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering meal preps from Portion Control for a few weeks. Could I shop/cook for myself? Absolutely, would I get the same variety and deliciousness from it, absolutely not. Super easy w/ their delivery, incredibly nice people, and they've worked around some dietary needs that I've been wanting to institute with ease. I cannot recommend Portion Control enough."}
{"text":"If i never come back it'll be to soon. The pictures of the food look way better than what it actually tastes. And it's way over priced not only that but when you walk in you might get someone to greet you mostly they just stare and ask what you'd like to order. Great concept, bad execution."}
{"text":"I was referred to portion control  Thur friend. I got 7 meals  and was very happy  with them .the portion  were great and the seasons  on the meats  and vegetables wad great. I'm single older male.i will be ordering here big weekly. Great place."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and the chef let me know all the ingredients.  The salmon was cooked amazingly well and the zucchini was green heartiness."}
{"text":"Always a good experience.  Love the cauliflower crust BBQ chicken pizza. Wife loves the salmon burger."}
{"text":"Amazing healthy spot. Love that they have the macros broken down! I'm assuming the lady answering my zillion questions was the owner. She was amazing and printed out my macros for me so I could take it on my to go Order.  Would be 5 star but the protein pancakes were not fantastic. More like a 4/10. The zucchini noodle with meatballs however was a 10!"}
{"text":"food is great so many healthy options staff is friendly and very helpful a i recommend the salmon taste great"}
{"text":"Slow is an understatement. Haven't tried the food yet, but standing here for 15 minutes so far...  Pre order If like me, you value your time!"}
{"text":"I heard of them on Instagram and was happy to find out that they have a location in Gramercy. I wanted to test them out before ordering meal prep. I am so glad that I did. First of all, even though it's called Portion control, the servings are generous and filling. I am a pretty big guy and I cannot be content with 2 ounces of chicken at lunch. I was so surprised that their chicken Parmesan filled me up. I almost had a hard time finishing it but due to the deliciousness I felt like I couldn't waste it! Now for the taste... I was very impressed! I got one of the protein shakes and chicken Parmesan  and let me tell you both were outstanding! Almost Didn't feel like healthy food to me.  Only thing is, I didn't see micros on their website. I could be blind but I'd like to know the calorie and fat content of the meals.  This still didn't take away from my excellent overall experience. I do still want to try foodie fit meal prep and then decide which to use for my dietary needs. However, give this place a try even if you are just looking for a healthy delicious lunch or a healthy after workout snack."}
{"text":"One word: GARLIC. Too much of it all over the place, especially in any kind of ground meat. Supposedly, other people I know have mentioned it to the staff and management, and it seemed to taper off for awhile, but it's back and as overwhelming as ever. Aside from that, the food is great, but the garlic thing is just out of control. I've ordered meal prep several times and it's to the point where I'm going to have to choose another place, If it were not for the over use of GARLIC, I would have given 5 stars! Portion control, your food is great and everything is always very fresh, but please don't feel the need to season your food so much to the point of it being inedible. It's a matter of individual taste, and things like salt, pepper, condiments, etc come in individual packets for a reason. Most people who eat clean don't mind more of a clean taste anyway! PLEEEEEAAAAAASSSSEE, cut down on the the GARLIC!"}
{"text":"Their new restaurant at gramercy is great! Best meal from a healthy restaurant I have ever had. This review is from someone who has dined at Greens and Proteins, Protein Source and other health food restaurants in the valley. I was and am still a fan of those restaurants, but Portion Control takes the cake (pun intended).  The food is so good that I often forget what I am putting in my body is healthy and nutritious. The name is deceiving because the portions are large too. My favorite item so far has been the chopped turkey salad. Huge and delicious. They use a vegan dressing- which I swear to you is even better than fatty ranch dressing.   Take my word for it- you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal and plans - the food is fresh and tastes great. Speedy delivery and easy to order online. The kale chips and protein bites are my favorite . So is the turkey bolognese .  Everything is really flavorful and I can order just what I need for the week."}
{"text":"Amazing food! If your looking for healthy food that makes you feel like your cheating this is the place! The chili verde is amazing and the buffalo bowls are yummy and the kale chips can't get enough of those lol!"}
{"text":"Love it here! Healthy options to satisfy any craving! It's good for when you need gains for bulking or if you wanna cut and go carbless. The bang bang chicken is amazing. Packed full of flavor and very indulgent. I've also had the bbq chicken pizza which you can't even tell has cauliflower crust. Again, full of flavor. The portions are good and the price is reasonable. The workers are very friendly and have great customer service. If you like to eat out but want to be healthy conscious without sacrificing flavor and deliciousness, come here!"}
{"text":"Do it yourself plate: 1) shredded chicken was SO salty, it was barely palatable. Tapatio helped. 2) Stir fried (cubed) sweet potatoes: some cubes were perfectly textured (soft and tender), while others were hard and crunchy, bordering on raw. 3) Stir-fried veggies: there were only 2 veggies: whole green beans (tips removed). Every one was almost completely raw. Red bell peppers were cooked perfectly. Veggies and sweet potatoes were seasoned nicely. No time for a remake. Dish took 15 min to get to me with 3 other patrons seated. Outdoor patio dining is a nice touch."}
{"text":"OMG...love their food. It's helping me keep on track with my fitness goals. Nothing I tried is bad and the owners are very accommodating."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat healthy and stay healthy. Warm and welcoming! Vegan, vegetarian friendly as well. If you have any specific questions or you have specific diet, portion control always ready to work with you and help you and be there for you! This place is Rocking it. Stay healthy."}
{"text":"Portion Control is a new healthy restaurant, there are so many options and the flavors are amazing with the right portions. Love the tofu fries!"}
{"text":"Super clean restaurant. The food is AMAZING. The way they prepare the food to taste so good is incredible. I've been to a lot of \"health food\" spots and it never taste that good. There also always adding new items to the menu."}
{"text":"\"Portion control\" is another way of saying \"our potions are so small that you will still be hungry after eating here\". It's my fault for not realizing that before purchasing lunch from here.  I had the Salmon plate. The flavor wasn't bad but also nothing special. There are tons of healthy options in Henderson and Vegas in general. Skip this place."}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY!! It's a must go to place!! Every thing is cooked to order and they will make meals for you to take home. Very flavorful and yummy"}
{"text":"DOUBLE LOVE this place. This review  is long over due. Delicious, healthy, affordable food and above and beyond customer service. After working up an appetite post Christmas shopping, a friend and I stoped in for a bite. While enjoying our excellent food, a delightful employee came over to our table and gave us sample items they were testing to add to the meal plan menu to take home on the house. What an angel! The stuffed cabbage BTW, was the best stuffed cabbage I've ever had!! It's always a treat to pay these guys a visit!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying this spot but it came up short.   Our order: (called ahead) Chicken Satay Chicken Caesar Wrap  The chicken satay was undercooked and raw in the middle. The cucumber salad and coconut brown rice were tasty. But raw chicken is unforgivable.   Our chicken Caesar wrap was ok, but we ordered no tomatoes and there were plenty of them.   Also to top it off on a 1 hour work lunch our order didn't go through from when we called ahead and had to wait 20+ minutes.   Not sure if we will be returning. Like the idea of a health conscious restaurant but the raw chicken and not putting in our call order was incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"I can't cook for shit. Vince has made my life so incredibly easier because I can keep on eating the way I need to for my body to function optimally and not worry about trying to cook. The food is so good and doesn't even taste like its \"healthy\" food.  Thank you Vince and Natalee for making my life so much easier!!!"}
{"text":"Such great tasting HEALTHY, clean food!!! Thank you Vince and Natalee for making my life easier!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service- just started a strict diet this week and this is the first time I didn't feel like I was missing out- the food was delicious and everyone in the family loved it! I hope there is one coming soon to the northwest side of town so we can eat it more often- otherwise I'll have to move!"}
{"text":"Beautiful side of town. You walk in and the morning team is always helpful. I'm doing the Raw fitness challenge and they have made their own recipes to Help us be successful and is literally steps from the gym. Staff is great! Owner helps and is a pretty nice guy. Restaurant is clean, food tastes amazing. I have yet to have anything negative to say. I highly recommend this place. Pricing is a little high when you go there as often as I do. Then again, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Don't let the business name mis-lead you, you get plenty of food with every order. Great meal plans to help you meet your fitness goals.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start. I never thought it was possible to make healthy food taste so good, but like their sign says \"Health Food Redefined\". Redefined it is. A friend of mine recommended I stop by this place so I gave it a shot.  When I walked in I could tell it must have just opened, as it seemed they were still doing some decorating. Vince the Chef/ Owner warmly greeted me and welcomed me in. He explained that they weren't \" technically\" opened yet as they did not have their menu boards and were still working on the decor so they were just doing a sort of soft opening, and instructed me to order anything off the menu.  The menu has many nice touches and quite seems to have many different influences .I must say that for a place that wasn't \"technically opened yet, they seemed to be pretty popular. And I know why. THEY MAKE HEALTHY FOOD TASTE GREAT!!! Can't wait to come back. I plan on working my way through the entire menu. Today my wife had the salmon burger with delicious kale chips. Delicious kale chips? I know right but ya they were just so damned good. I had a flat iron steak sandwich. I would love to tell you how good it was but I made my wife eat it because I stole her salmon burger. I don't even like salmon."}
{"text":"The food is OK but the service is super super slow. They do not seem to be very organized either. The restaurant is modern and clean. It's worth trying but you must have time and not be in a rush."}
{"text":"Love it. Good healthy food, what else could u want?( I do wish the menus would include nutritional info)"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here Friday night and it was fantastic.  We have decided to try the meal plans and will be ordering that this week.  Hopefully it will be as great as dining in the restaurant.   The people who work at Portion Control are very helpful."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  If your looking for a quick pit stop mid day, to go pickup or even ordering your weekly meal prep... this is your place Togo!!  Very affordable compared to he competition (money and calorie wize!!) the service is phenomenal food is amazing and place is bomb!  I ate the zucchini pomodaro bowl and ordered protein nights and kale chips to go, all were to perfection"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Portion Control to me and I am so glad she did. Meal Prep can be difficult. These guys do it all for you-but better. The food is really amazing. When I meal prep at home I usually spend so much time chopping and portioning that by the time it's time to eat it I'm already bored with it. This food tastes so great it's easy to forget that it's fuel. They put all the dietary information on the label for for you which I like. There was a mistake made with my order and the owners made sure to correct it right away. Overall my experience has been a positive one and I would 100% recommend them."}
{"text":"This place has the tastiest healthy food in town! They have created a menu that makes eating healthy easy with plenty of delicious choices! Natalee and Vince you guys rock!"}
{"text":"Wow. I wish I lived here so I could come here frequently. So many healthy choices. Very easy to find great meal for vegan or low carb or raw or whatever your dietary requests are!  The Thai chicken lettuce cups were fabulous and the BCAA smoothie was a lovely treat!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant with my wife and was helped out by kaleah!  We waited over 30 minutes for our food even though there was only one other customer in the entire restaurant.  After waiting for our food for over 30 minutes, our fries were completely burnt!? after I asked to exchange the fries, they seemed annoyed but the second order of fries was also burned. I also asked to eat in and received my food to go.  I'm extremely disappointed, I paid $40 dollars for our food and even left a tip and the service was terrible.  My wife ordered a burger and her fries were burned they were literally black!? I ordered some chicken fingers and my meal only had two chicken fingers. I spend $40 dollars on food, after finishing my food, I was still hungry.  I've been here a couple times before and always leave a tip. I'm a very passive person and do not like to complain but this was just ridiculous. I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"The place is catered to the more vegan crowd. However, even if you're a vegan then I still would not recommend this place. The wait time is horrible. The fruit was not fresh and they have a little to no selection on beverages.  The smoothies are well overpriced as well."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3 times and the food blows me away. It is gourmet food in servings that don't leave you feeling like you just ate the entire cow.  I also like the fact that there is a viewing window to watch the kitchen. These folks are the real deal chefs.  And the food is healthy fare with mostly gluten free offerings.  One of my top go-to places!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  We just ate dinner there to try it out after hearing about this new restaurant.  What a delightful surprise.  I had the Lettuce Cup Fish Tacos with brown rich.  Delish! My wife had the Blackened White Fish with  asparagus and zucchini noodles.  Who said healthy eating has to be full?  This is going to be one of my favorite go-to places.  The prices are reasonable. The service was great... very friendly servers.  The only suggestion I would have for them is to add calorie content information to the menu.  We will be back.  Often!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, hip location and atmosphere.  I can't find anything to complain about.  You are going to pay more than you would at a Chipotle or similar fast casual establishment,  but it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there and holy cow, it was amazing. Portions are perfect. I left there feeling great, I wasn't feeling full or bloated nor hungry still. I got the bang bang chicken. I highly recommend. Seasoning was perfect. It taste so good! They also have kids portions available. Will be going there more often."}
{"text":"Love eating here. Been back numerous times since they opened in Henderson. Especially enjoy building my own plate with protein choice and sides. Everything is always fresh and hot. Also tried the cauliflower pizza - oh yum! The pesto sauce is amazing - they need to bottle that so I can bring it home !!!"}
{"text":"The food quality is top notch! Healthy and delicious! Not to mention owned by good people. The kitchen is in open view and you can see the pride they take in keeping it clean. Also I should add that we have eaten there multiple times with our newborn baby, the bathrooms are very clean with brand new changing tables making it a great place to eat with the family and not feel stressed if you have to feed or change your infant."}
{"text":"Such an awesome find! Everything from start to finish (service, food, decor, portions, price, etc.) was perfect. This will definitely become my go-to lunch spot. I had the Mediterranean wrap with a side salad. Flavor was great - everything was so fresh. The wrap was huge, I ended up taking half with me. I can't wait to come back to try some other items on the menu. The menu is gigantic and super diversified. I didn't see anything on the menu that wasn't healthful and delicious. My only regret is I didn't take a picture of my plate before I devoured it."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best places to go if you're looking for healthy/clean foods! Who would've thought eating healthy is not as boring as you may have thought! Their chicken fingers, kale chips and their BBQ Chicken pizza are my all time favorites! This place is 35 minutes away from me but I still make the drive because it IS THAT good! Definitely recommend it!! You can also call to order in advance and just pick up, have them meal prep, and they deliver now with StubHub! I absolutely love this place!!"}
{"text":"Such a fun, healthy, young vibe that creates an amazing ambiance! The meals are super delicious and are prepared quickly. There's menu items for every ages which is really nice!  I recently ordered 12 meals to go, and were able to get them within two days! I ordered them Monday night and went to get them Wednesday morning! All super delicious and have the macros listed on it, which is super nice for some one that pays attention to the macros!  Will be coming here ALOT and ordered the meal plans ALOT! Defiantly recommend any one who is trying to eat healthy."}
{"text":"I always assume that good food at proper portions are small and tasteless.  Then, I walk into Portion Control.  The walls are not drab and filled with Nazi signs screaming about fat is bad or banning butter. The cute ambiance shocked me out of my stereotyping and provided me a comfortable toe in the water. The menu has things like farmers market stir fry with zucchini noodles, or burgers. I gave the Cali club wrap with kale chips a go.  Before you go down the same path I did about kale chips, take it from this fat chick when I say these are easy replacements for Doritos or lightly salted Lays.  The wrap was delicious and flavor filled. I even tried my friends fried rice and was shocked that they make teriyaki like sauce that's tasty and GOOD FOR YOU.  Please, all my fatties, if you need to find a place to eat out without feeling like life is over with good food, come in here. I promise you won't regret it. If you lose weight while you're at it, it's a bonus."}
{"text":"Not only is food delicious but service is outstanding, we have tried the mac & cheese, cauliflower pizza, bang bang chicken, orange chicken, veggie lasagna all tasty yet I have to say chicken pomodoro & shepherds pie have got to be my my fave so far, almost feels like I'm having a cheat meal due to how good it is specially the protein shakes they taste like dessert   yet the best thing is it's super healthy, I eat with no guilt here, love it!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with my visit to portion control today. We ordered here as a whole office around $90.00 for about 6 people. I called and placed an order around 10:00 a.m asking if we could have it ready around 12:00 - 12:15 we showed up to portion control around 12:10 our food was ready. We were helped by a young lady who I think was pretty new...All 6 of us only drank water and when we asked for a to-go water cup, they charged us which was odd considering they have never charged us before and they have red plastic cups sitting right next to the water to be used for free.. We decided to sit outside and eat it was clean and well shaded.. all of our food was challenge approved which we asked for it to be a regular menu item. We got chicken strips and they were very dry and very unflavored they did not include kale chips and the fries were not flavorful. We also ordered the steak and potatoes, and the steak was very very chewy and hard to eat. We also got the chicken sauté, the portion was extremely small and it did not come with any rice and again the chicken was dry.. The last thing we ordered was chicken teriyaki which was supposed to have mixed in season veggies and it only had a small serving or chicken, a ton of broccoli, and a small scoop of rice which was all caked in watery teriyaki sauce. I decided that for spending $90.00 this should be brought to someone's attention. I called and asked to speak with a manager who answered the phone with a \"hello\" I had to ask if it was a manager and I also had to ask whom I was speaking with... Chef Daniel was not very concerned stating that because we ordered take out and because the food sat was the reason that the food turned out the way it did... after I assured him that it should have only been sitting for 10 minutes at the most and it shouldn't have affected it the way that it did all he said was \"oh, sorry about that well next time you are here just remind me okay?\" It is not my job to remind you... if you are a manager it should have been handled before we disconnected that phone call... Maybe this is good service? Maybe I should just let it go? I don't know but I am very dissatisfied with portion control and I do not think I will be returning which is very unfortunate..."}
{"text":"Everyone is friendly and gladly answers any and all questions you may have with the menu or food prep service. The location is convenient and to go ordering is a breeze. After being stuck on Greens & Proteins and Protein Source for months, this is a tasty alternative. The menu selection is outstanding and everything is so flavorful. That's right.....FLAVORFUL. Not just healthy, but tastes good too. I find the other \"healthy\" spots to be pretty bland. The breakfast skillet is sooooo good. I haven't ordered anything I wouldn't get again."}
{"text":"Went in for my first time. The person working the front didn't know what they had so the order I put in wasn't able to be made. Then I asked for a refund he said he couldn't cause the manager wasn't there. & that I could come back later in the day for my refund. TERRIBLE first experience and I didn't even get to try the food. See ya never portion control. First impression is everything"}
{"text":"I love this healthy restaurant and I can't get enough of there tofu frys those are a big must if your eating here they have a lot of great dishes and can even make them vegetarian for you. They also have really good breakfast my daughter loves the protein pancakes"}
{"text":"Love the healthy meals options. Nice staff. Couple times my orders got mixed up, that's about it.   Try the turkey chili and the bfast skillet!"}
{"text":"I first tried this restraunt after hearing about it at the gym and now I'm hooked. I have tried alot of the menu and have yet to be dissapointed. Some of my favs being the turkey chili, zucchini promodoro, lettuce wraps (SPICY and delicious) and kale chips."}
{"text":"I picked up my first meal prep order yesterday and I wanted to wait until I had eaten before leaving my review. WOW-this food is good! Other reviews have mentioned they don't like the ordering system, but for me it was a breeze. I found that my e-mails were responded to quickly, all my questions were answered, and I was told exactly when my order would be ready. Would it be nice to have an automated/drop-down menu type of ordering on their web site? Yes, but they are a small family business. They'll get there! For now I'm just fine with e-mailing in.  I ordered the bronze package, which is five meals and five snacks. I did five fruit salads, chicken enchiladas, miso shrimp, miso salmon, bang bang chicken, and teriyaki chicken. I had the enchiladas for lunch today. My first impression was DANG this smells awesome! I'm not a fan of zucchini, and I even ate the grilled zucchini that came with it because it was so good. And don't let the name fool you-these are hearty portions of healthy food. This particular meal had three enchiladas, a big scoop of rice, and a huge portion of zucchini. I couldn't even finish it and I'll be saving my third enchilada for dinner tonight.  The customer service was awesome, too. I walked in, gave the girl (I wish I caught her name-she was so nice!) my name, paid and checked to make sure everything was in my bag and left. The decor is cute and next time I pick up a prep order I'll likely dine in to give some of their other menu items that can't be ordered for prep a try. I highly recommend them. It was worth every penny for their service-the meals are delicious, and as somebody who works two jobs, it's great to have healthy meals that I can just grab and go."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch cause i seen one of my IG followers posting about it. Asked the kid at the register if the Salmon was Wild Caught or Farm raised and he had no clue. Strike 1.. ordered the Steak Sandwich Med Rare and it came out completely raw with a sear on it, Strike 2. He takes it back and then cooks it where it is medium and then the pieces were so thick that it wouldn't even rip apart, strike 3. The manager then came up to me and didn't even apologize and asked if i wanted something else and i told him \"no\". He handed me my change once again and didn't apologize. On a good note the place actually is really nice and I like the window that you can see them cooking your food. Too bad I won't be back. Strike 4,5,6,7,8,9"}
{"text":"First experience here at the SW location (their new shop is in Henderson off St. Rose) and I ordered the Chicken and Broccoli with brown rice. With the name \"Portion Control\" one might conclude that portions would be small but that's not the case.  My lunch was made fresh and served hot off the wok/grill. The flavors of the sauce were wonderful, chicken breast slices were juicy and broccoli all dente - as it should be. Lunch was only $7.99, so to those skeptics - healthy options don't have to cost a fortune. Delicious food and friendly service, I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I went tgis morning for energy pancakes and it took for ever!!!!the girl in thw counter needs to work on hwr customer service .she was just not welcoming but she was to her friends even smiled and had a full on conversation.i waited i was about to walk out amd finally got my food but wait the girl behind me got her food first,reminder her friend.the pancakes looked like for a 5 year old nothing special. I will just continue going to protein house."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  The food is high quality and has so much flavor.  It is hard to believe that it is good for you.  We utilized their meal prep service during our Raw Fitness 6 week challenge and it helped so much.  It is still a family favorite now that the challenge is over.    The staff is also very efficient and friendly!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, the owner does not care about his customers in anyway, they messed up 2 meal prep orders in a row, shorted me meals, and did nothing not even apologize for it. The owner is arrogant and pompous I will never give them another cent of my money and neither should you!!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were introduced to Portion Control because we are currently doing the 6 week Raw Fitness Challenge. This restaurant has helped us through the challenge tremendously! I've only tried the challenge approved meals but I can't wait to try other items on the menu once the challenge is over. Their soaked oats are one of my favorites, I don't know what they do to them but I'm obsessed. They turn the healthy, bland food that we have to eat into flavorful dishes. I've always received awesome customer service every time I've been there and it's conveniently located for me as well. I'll continue to be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"I can't express how wonderful this meal was!!!  I ended up hosting a last minute Thanksgiving and wouldn't of had the time to make a turkey. Lucky for me they had a pre fixed Thanksgiving menu that saved the day!  Everything tasted wonderful! Portions were generous, food was tasty, and the time I asked for the food to be done was respected.  The staff was friendly and I had plenty of help getting the food into my car.  I highly recommend this place for any holiday! I look forward to their Christmas dinner menu :)"}
{"text":"This is a local restaurant that started out preparing portion controlled meals for customers. I've been a customer of the meal prep service and now am a big fan of the restaurant. Their food is AMAZING in my book and always healthy. It's fantastic that you can get healthy food that makes you feel guilty it tastes so delicious. It's perfect when you need to eat out and stay true to healthy eating habits."}
{"text":"As a foodie who is scared of being deprived of flavorful foods when eating healthy... this place is a MUST TRY!!!   I had just got done from the gym and decided to try portion control because it is conveniently located by my gym.   They have a huge selection of foods (much larger than I thought). They have wraps, bowls, breakfast items and other specialty entree. I thought it was cool that they have cauliflower breaded pizza. I just think that's pretty unique to have at a restaurant.    I believe the server told me that the most popular items were the zucchini pomodoro and the bang bang chicken.   But I ended up trying the child verde. And oh. My. God. Was it so good!!! I was so highly impressed right at that first bite. The entree came with chicken in the child verde sauce, spanish rice, and broccoli. It was all a flavor bomb!! And the best part is that I didn't feel guilty of eating such a good meal.   I would definitely recommend this place. I'll be waiting for the day that this place opens up more locations all throughout the valley!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place, I've been to the restaurant 8 times in the past three weeks and tried something new each time, never disappointed.  I've yet to decide what my favorite plate is but I would definitely recommend all the bowls.  I frequent all the favorite healthy spots in the SW part of town, Protein Source, Greens & Protein, Roots, etc and I must say the culinary efforts of Executive Chef Vince Upperman and his team are outstanding, the flavors in each dish explode in your mouth, they live by their motto \"health food redefined\", a must visit for all."}
{"text":"Was looking to eat there after couple recommendations.  Just the name \"portion control\" was attractive.. ordered the Vegan burger. The burger was serve in a timely manners. I was looking at the open kitchen the time I was waiting. Jessica has a nervous tic and play with her hair. So if you are behind the line ready to serve my plate, i am really not sure why you decide to recenter my burger with your hand and did not asked the chef to do it. Sometime shortcut are not good and basic health knowledge should be necessary to serve food. Do you at least carry a Tam card ?  Unfortunately my burger was not the best and I feel eating a hipster food from the 90's. Spicy ketchup with french fries. Unusual and maybe a good idea, i did not care for it.it will be nice if the cashier mention it and propose an alternative. Sorry, I was not impress with my first visit."}
{"text":"I am 5 weeks into the Raw 6 week challenge and Portion Control has made this possible for me. The food is delicious and \"challenge approved\" thank god, because the diet during the challenge is really tough. I love cooking and I still struggle daily with how to make meals that are tasty and within the parameters of the Raw challenge diet. Portion Control has helped me stay on track, and when the challenge ends I will still eat there because the food is excellent. This being said, my favorite thing about Portion Control is the lovely supportive people who work there; they remember your name, they have big smiles, and they really understand delicious healthy food. You guys are awesome :)"}
{"text":"Saw they just opened so decided to give it a try. Very nice inside, calm and not fast food at all even though my food was ordered and arrived at table in less than 10min. I love you can see through window at chef cooking in an extremely clean kitchen. I ordered the veggie lasagna and was delish. I got it to go so looked a awful mess. I like that there is alot of variety, wish more vegan/veggie dishes but all in all I will definitely return."}
{"text":"My order took forever cause someone accidentally threw away my ticket in cook line. A really nice gentleman there apologized and offered me a complimentary smoothie which was delicious. When I finally got my order, the sauce for the chicken fingers was missing and when I asked for it, the girl squeezed a tiny bit into a container. When I asked her for a little more she said they don't have anymore. The same gentleman that gave me the smoothie said that she didn't even give me the right sauce. When I finally eat my meal, the chicken was rubbery and dry. I can deal with mishaps but was more so upset that I waited so long for a disappointing meal. I'm sure other items there are good, but I won't be back to try them."}
{"text":"Loved this place. So stoked to have another healthy option in Henderson. Lots of options to choose from, good location. I wish they had nutrition facts on their stuff, but excited this place is here and will be going back."}
{"text":"Of all the healthy places to eat around here, this one doesn't really compete.  They do have a lot to choose from on the menu, but their macro breakdown isn't included on the menu--it's on a separate menu and makes it really confusing and difficult to make a decision if you're watching your macros.  The girl at the counter said they have \"protein\" shakes but they don't put protein powder or supplements in them.  Ok well that's called a smoothie or dessert.  I got a salad to go.  It was a salad....nothing to call your mom about."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of this place, everything on the menu is overpriced and they have a bad customer service, the guy at the register made a mistake on my order and when I complained he start arguing with me. I wouldn't go back there!! Way too overpriced and it doesn't even taste that great!"}
{"text":"I title this review \"A simple answer to a simple question\"   I ordered from Portion Control 6 months back and I loved everything about their food. So flavorful and healthy and their food is much more creative than any other meal prep I have encountered in Vegas thus far.  Something to note about this company, it was started up and ran by a husband and wife team and while they are doing a great job with the food portion of their business they seem to have some growing pains with the customer service side of their business. I noticed slow email responses and archaic ordering system and no website, really? These things can be streamlined so easily nowadays, there are so many apps and tools to help businesses. Just an overall sense of an underdeveloped \"business 101\" from this company. Of course this is not something that deterred me or should deter anyone really, as a business owner myself I know what its like to start something from the bottom and while I yearned for a smoother way to transact with this company their extremely friendly attitude and eagerness to have my business really made their growing pains tolerable.  Fast forward six months, I decided to order again religiously and asked to be emailed a new menu. Thinking that the 6 months I hadn't ordered their business would have improved and have a more streamlined way to order, get order confirmation, ask questions and pay the bill etc...well Yelpers nothing has changed.   I called on a Tuesday 2x to no avail so I sent an email asking for an updated menu. I got the menu and I noticed they now have Meal PACKAGES! WOO HOO This was something I wanted prior and was ecstatic to see on their new menu. The gold package advertises 21 meals and 7 snacks, enough for 7 days of breakfasts, lunches, snacks and dinners with a discount of 12% off menu prices! BUT this package DOES NOT include any signature dishes (which in my opinion are the best and what I solely ordered prior). Since they had no package for Signature dishes I phoned them again (to no avail) and then proceeded to email (again) asking this   VERY   SIMPLE   QUESTION...   \"Can I order 21 SIGNATURE dishes and 7 snacks and would I still get the 12% discount like your Gold Package?\"   His email response was this:  \"You can sub out any item on any meal plan the price will just adjust ( but the discount will still apply) so from breakfast its a $5 vaule, if you wanted a 2 item combo it would just go up $2, or if you wanted a 3 item combo it would got up $5 to make it a $10 dish.  Any 2 item can be done the same way , $7 vaule bumped to a $10 vaule Any three item combo can be subbed for a $10 or less signture dish, or the same as above applys, please let mre know if you have any other questions.\"  Did YOU the reader even get through his response above? Is this a math problem from my 7 year old's Common Core worksheet? What kind of response is that? So you want me to hand add $2, $3, $5 to my 21 items individually, every week?  I expected a simple answer to a simple question. Again I proceeded to immediately call him for clarification and asked \"hey do I get a 12% discount or not if I order 21 meals\" and he said, \"not really 12% but around that. Just email us everything you want and we will add it up and get a price back to you\" I did what he asked and sent my order yet he claims he didn't get my order (sent 3 times) BUT he got my emails asking him if he got my order? Strange. Then he finally sends me a bill and says I can pick up on Sunday. Mind you I started this whole process on Tuesday.   So today I look at the bill and guess what? There is no discount for ordering 21 Signature items, his total of $231 is the same total you get by hand adding them up from their menu. When I asked him about this via text (again phone not avail) he shows me a screen shot from his computer showing me that he took the tax off which is 18 dollars. OH, then why didn't you just let me know FROM THE BEGINNING WHICH WAS 5 DAYS AGO that there is NO discount just tax removed. AGAIN a simple answer to a simple question would have been appreciated. 5 days of endless emails, phone calls and texts to solve their food math riddle. Seems silly he wanted me to hand add $2, $3, and $5 dollars to 21 different dishes every week just for him to discount the tax. So essentially the price stayed EXACTLY THE SAME and then he proceed to condescend me via text that he explained it to me and sorry I didn't understand. What was to understand? There was no discount, just SAY that from the beginning! We really needed to exchange 9 texts, 10 emails and 7 phone calls for this?  Good Food? YES   Good Customer Service? MEH  Here is a little business 101, all parts of your business need to shine, not just the food. Your food may gain initial business but confusing and passive customer service will not sustain you.  All someone has to do is make a Meal Prep company with good food and shine where you fail.   THANK YOU for wasting the last 5 days for me."}
{"text":"I'm sure glad I checked my food before leaving this place and heading home. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad with EVERYTHING on it. Mind you the menu had over 8 or so different things on this salad. How many did I get on mine? 4 at the most and instead of feta cheese as the menu advertised, mine had cheddar on it for some strange reason? And didn't have cauliflower as again the menu advertised so. I told the cashier and she seemed clueless then took it back to the girl who made it and that chick said no that salad doesn't come with that stuff. The girl who made it had the worst attitude about the whole situation. Then she must of realized she was in the wrong because I noticed she added more things that should of been on there from the beginning. Don't advertise something on a menu in clear OBVIOUS view if you're not going to make the food as so. The salad was disgusting and I would of rather gone to skinny fats or ate a basic salad at home. You have to have no taste buds or enjoy bland taste to eat at this place. I give this place 6 months, if that..."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the new  Portion Control. We waited for 45 minutes to get our food and there was 2 other people in the restaurant so it wasn't like it was busy. Once our food came out it was cold as if it had been sitting out for awhile. The steak was over cooked so much I couldn't even chew it. I have been to the other locations several times and the last two times my food came out cold but was still good. When I saw a new Portion Control I was excited to give it a try, but it doesn't seem like the problem ever got fixed. You would think with it being the Grand Opening they would be a little more on top of things."}
{"text":"Heard many good things about the place so dropped in at 12h30. Not very busy, no line, few customers.  Rating is a 1 star because it took 25 minutes to get my order of a single pizza prepared. I recognize this is not a fast food place, but had to get it packed and ate it about 5 hours later since I had to get back to work etc.  For the food, I would rate at 3 stars: the idea of the cauliflower crust is very original.  The menu is extensive and likely too large and customizable for a staff of what looked like 2 in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The food isn't terrible compared to other health food places, but it's also not the best. I dislike that there isn't much consistency here. I have ordered dishes multiple times and they are made differently with different sides or sauces and that's just disappointing when you are paying the same amount as the time before and expecting the same meal. I have also tried to call orders in and the phone almost always rings busy and can't get through. Hoping its just the kinks being worked out of a new business."}
{"text":"First time here and will most likely not come back. My girlfriend and I wanted to try this place out we heard about it from a friend and looked at yelp to see what food options they had and it looked really appetizing. I ordered the BLT with chicken and she ordered the chicken finger sandwich. Both of them were SUPER DRY we literally took Hot sauce, ketchup ,BBQ, ranch we tried it all to make it taste better but it really didn't help we tried to eat as much as we could since we didn't eat all day but we barley even ate to half of it. I wanted to order the kale chips but I guess they were all out of it so I ordered the humus with veggies and I get this place is called PORTION CONTROL but how do you expect me to eat that all that humus with only 3 sticks of celery and 3 sticks of carrots  the best thing we had during that meal were the sweet potato fries and the water."}
{"text":"Incredible little spot. Gourmet health food at its finest. I've been here now several times. Definitely one of the places at the top of my rotation.  I usually get the chicken and broccoli. My Gf is vegetarian and has tried multiple different plates and loved everything she tried."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! They give a lot of food and the prices are very decent for the location of the restaurant and the amount you get. The food is healthy but flavorful! I dined in, but will definitely check out their meal prep options in the future. Friendly staff and cute decor!"}
{"text":"I got the fish lettuce wrap tacos and they were deliciousssssssss! My friend got the turkey burger which was equally amazing!! We went around 4-5pm and the food came out within 10 minutes or less. The person who was up front was really nice and let us try the pb&j protein bites (which we totally ended up buying 6 and I don't even like peanut butter lol) The actual inside itself is beautiful and looks very sharp and clean! I'm excited to try more. We thought the portions would be smaller well.... because it's portion control, but we were left full and satisfied"}
{"text":"These prepared meals are like 4 star restaurant fare. The shepherds pie is great and the ahi Nicole's salad was wonderfully flavored. The chimmichurri steak is medium cooked and tender... the perfect paleo meal. Other prepared meal providers are good for the diet oriented patron, but if you want a chef's touch to your protein intake this is the place. Newest location is St Rose and Coronado Center Drive, not yet listed on yelp. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Street Tacos and the Pesto Shrimp. Both were excellent dishes. I was impressed with the selection on the menu. Lots to chose from. Customer service was friendly and helpful. Plenty of tables and chairs. Also, they are open on Sundays which is nice to see :) Will definitely return here. A+"}
{"text":"Let's start off with I'm not a healthy eater. I'm not terrible unhealthy but give me meat and fried food and I'm happy.  My wife tries to be healthy so she took me here.  Got the steak sandwich and sweet potato fries (fried) and I gotta say it was delicious.  My wife got the chicken satay salad and the chicken was amazing (I don't do salad). The customer service was great. The place was clean and I liked the fact that you are able to see the kitchens and the cooks preparing the food.   Great place"}
{"text":"This isn't meant to be offensive to the staff in any way, I hope that this will help you improve. I decided to give portion control a try instead of my go-to, foodie fit. I ordered four days worth of meal prep -- the delivery driver was professional and timely. However, the food is just flat out bad. I ordered a few meals with ground turkey (the taco salad and the turkey burgers) and they were tasteless, had zero seasoning, we're way too moist, and tasted so awful I threw both of them out. Not to mention the turkey meat is directly on top of the salad -- how is one supposed to microwave that effectively? The chicken wasn't any better and lacked taste -- there's a difference between being lean and lacking any taste whatsoever. All in all I feel that I wasted my money trying this service and would recommend new users starting small to see if this is what you are looking for. The macro counts are also off -- I ordered 8oz of ground turkey for the salad and it supposedly had only 23 grams of protein, not sure if these are printed automatically and not updated or what the issue is there. I can't say that I'm willing to give this place another try, the food literally left a bad taste in my mouth. Again, I am not trying to be offensive but instead fully transparent of my experience. Hope this will help you all improve."}
{"text":"Yum; great tasting healthy food! Hubby and I stopped in for a quick breakfast- skillet was awesome with a great flavor and cucumber mint water was so refreshing! Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Portion Control has incredible food options for a healthy lifestyle. I'm so glad that it's convenient and easy to get to. They have so many options to choose from which is great! The food itself has amazing flavor too and not your boring cardboard healthy eating!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The chicken fingers are absolutely delicious and everything about the place is a great, but the name and logo is so off putting. It sounds like it should be Jenny Craig or something. Please change the name because everything else is soooo good"}
{"text":"I just finished my first 3 days of meal prep, and so far everything has been amazing!  I also picked up my 2nd 3 day pack this evening and every day Im excited to try something new.  This is my 2nd meal prep company here in town and so far I like Portion Control better than the first... they are more reasonable on price when you buy a package. They have more package options. The meals are larger, but still with good macros and calorie levels. And so far the food is tastier with some really amazing options!    Complaints so far... the macros aren't posted anywhere. I had to ask for them and the list I received is incomplete  (I believe they are working on this). Delivery is not available on Sunday... this seems odd to me for people who want to start a work week with their meal prep. And lastly, Ive had a couple goofs in my orders... twice Ive selected cabbage salad as a side, and both times I got cucumber salad instead. Luckily I like cucumber salad, lol.  And twice I got 6 week challenge versions of their salads instead of regular... which is healthier and still yummy, but was unnecessary for me."}
{"text":"Solid spot for a good, clean meal. Quick and healthy if you are on the run. A new 'go to' for sure"}
{"text":"Love this place. Not only is the food delicious but it's also good for you. We've been coming here for months and love having one of their Build Your Own meals. Protein and veggies. My body is thankful that I treat it as a temple by dining at Portion Control."}
{"text":"While I can definitely appreciate having a healthy option that's close by, I can't afford it! Almost $12 for a salad?! That's pushing it for most! I feel like this place is for the people who have a separate budget for their expensive coffees and prepared meals. this isn't for us regular folks with families. And the dry, cold chicken and excessive red onions didn't make me feel any better about paying so much for this salad."}
{"text":"Great menu selection! Delicious food! And the customer service was so refreshing. I'll be back there every time I'm in town. Thank you guys and the cooks for the quick meals!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I don't eat meat and had really great options and so did my husband who is an avid meat eater. Everyone was very kind and took pride in their service and food! Will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"As a new mom this is amazing. With the food prep I can have tasty food ready for me in the refrigerator and save me the hassle of trying to go to the store and cook. Plus I know that what I grab will keep me on track to loose these last extra pounds.   And now that they have a location I can grab a meal while I'm out and about and not feel like I'm cheating on my diet. Love this place."}
{"text":"Despite substantial research indicating the dangers of overweight and obesity the World's collective waistline continues to grow, a recent estimate suggesting nearly 40% of America will be at risk of adverse health outcomes based on weight alone by 2020, and with more diners adapting to \"quick casual\" and \"fast food\" rather than sit-down dinners the need for healthier options is at an all-time high, a fact clearly recognized by the team behind Portion Control.  Self-described as \"Healthy Food Redefined\" and representing a partnership between Justin Blum of Raw Fitness plus Chef Vince Upperman, the duo opening location one adjacent Blum's Gym at The Gramercy a year ago and following up with a Henderson location in early 2018, guests entering Portion Control will quickly notice the open kitchen, high ceilings and welcoming environs, a wide mix of guests including families as well as those fresh from a workout seated comfortably as an upbeat soundtrack plays overhead.  Catering to busy lifestyles and healthier ways of being, a promise of no preservatives, artificial flavors or GMO-ingredients prominently listed atop the Menu, it is in the new tradition of counter-style ordering that guests are enticed by a large board on the wall left of entry, each item cooked to order while they wait though those in a hurry are offered the convenience of ordering in advance and receiving a call when their selections are packed and ready to go.  Additionally providing meal-prep services and group orders easily tailored to catering, nutritional facts not yet available for the dine-in Menu but reportedly coming soon, it was alongside three adults with relevant healthcare experience plus one child that nine items from a list of over fifty were selected, the youngster in the group immediately coveting a Branched Chain Amino Acid Slushy that was both flavored and priced like those at the Movies without all the excess calories and unnatural Sugars or Dyes.  No stranger to mindful eating or the untoward effects of popular Foods, the items selected thus tailored towards the sort of things People and Patients say the \"crave\" daily, it was beginning with a \"Burger\" constructed of Black Beans and T.V.P. that lunch got underway, the Patty no less convincing than New York's popular \"Superiority Burger\" with a Bun that actually holds up better while the side of Waffled Sweet Potato Fries were crisp, oilless and tasty on their own but all the better when topped with housemade Turkey Chili that packs a lot of Protein and healthy Carbohydrates into each bite despite being devoid of unhealthy Fats.   Moving next to one of three Pizzas positioned atop a low-carb Cauliflower Crust, the Barbecue Chicken suggested by a woman who has lost over forty pounds while incorporating Portion Control as well as Raw Fitness into a healthy lifestyle, suffice it to say that those seeking the comfort of a pillowy Crust will likely be disappointed by Chef Upperman's creation while fans of thinner Pies will likely be more amenable, a follow-up Breakfast plate simply titled \"The Skillet\" not really all that different from similar dishes elsewhere but a steal at just $8 considering the Ingredient quality and nicely flavored Hash beneath an Over-Easy Egg.  Hearing frequently that Chinese Food is a trigger for those counting calories, an example more authentic than most dishes available at Panda Express or P.F. Chang's exhibited in a Bowl of \"Bang Bang Chicken,\" diners looking to add a bit of spice to their diet will likely be impressed by just how close the dish comes to replicating Spring Mountain Road without all the Oil, Upperman's spiraled Zucchini additionally providing an admirable stand-in for packaged Noodles.   Falling short on \"Veggie Lasagna,\" small bundles of rolled Squash around creamed Tofu leaving an odd aftertaste potentially related to non-dairy Cheese that was accentuated rather than muted by Romesco, it was in baked Chicken Breast coated in a crispy mixture of Oats that Portion Control was quickly back on track, the meal finally wrapping up in three fluffy Protein Pancakes largely indistinguishable from the sort served as Hotcakes beneath Golden Arches, the Sugar-free Topping nothing that will lead 100% Maple Syrup purists swearing off  the good stuff,  but the housemade Blueberry reduction and Market Fresh Strawberries plenty sweet enough for most.  As a practicing endocrinologist, traveling gourmand, avid runner/biker and former morbidly-obese twenty-something I'd argue that my knowledge of 'what it takes' to maintain one's weight comes from a place of expertise and although there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to lifelong health a combination of daily exercise and nutrition no doubt forms a strong backbone, something Vince Upperman's Portion Control aspires to assist in with overall impressive results."}
{"text":"I hear so many good things about portion control but I'm not impressed at all. Food is never cooked correctly. With my diet I have specific times to eat meals with specs. I just had to throw my food away (chicken adobo) because the rice was still raw. The meat loaf was xxxtra well done to a point I could not stab it with a fork. My plastic fork snapped in half.  I feel like no one quality checks there food. Not good business."}
{"text":"Took forever to get my food. Food tasted good, but was cold. So I asked them to warm it up and took another 15 minutes. So after an hour wait I finally got to eat."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this establishment. My son, girlfriend and I stopped in after our CrossFit class looking for a healthy option that won't destroy our diet.   As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the employee at the counter. We let her know it was our first time coming in and she gave us a pretty good rundown on how things work.   There are essentially three menus. One menu is for portion controlled take out. Another is the Raw Fitness diet challenge menu, this menu has a 3oz portion or protein. Then there is the regular menu that has 4oz of protein.   My family chose food off of the regular menu as our CrossFit challenge has us eating 6oz of protein. We ordered the Bang bang chicken that had chicken, chopped veggies and zucchini noodles in a semi spicy sauce. I ordered the zucchini pomodoro which had chicken meatballs, zucchini noodles and a very interesting delicious sauce. My son ordered the kids chicken fingers that came with sweet potato cross cut fries and a spicy ketchup.   Overall, the food was delicious and VERY filling. It was about $10 a person of you include the la croix water. I like that everything here is healthy, even the drinks.   I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I finished a 7 day meal prep with two meals and snacks and everything was great!! I've had the honor of trying a couple others (Health Binge, Foodie Fit, etc) and Portion Control blows them out of the water. It's healthy, flavorful, delicious, filling. Even the food at their brick and mortar location is da bomb. It's not tooooo expensive like others places.  I loved how you could Build Your Own and customize. So many options and you aren't stuck purchasing a meal plan where you don't like a meal. SOOOO many options.  Additionally the multiple locations through the valley for pickup is great.  I wanted to deduct a star because nutrition info isn't on everything, which is strange. Didn't tho. Woop."}
{"text":"Service is slow and not friendly. Breakfast scramble was bland and the feta cheese that allegedly came with was absent. Over priced. You can skip this place and you won't be missing a thing -- aside from the rich ladies over 40 sporting their Lululemon post workout, that is."}
{"text":"Food is okay but not the best service. I have been five times mainly because I live in the building and every time the order is either wrong or they take a very long time. My last visit I placed a take out order, left, came back twenty minutes later and they forgot to make one of the three dishes I ordered. I then had to leave and come back again 20 min later. Need to step it up on customer service."}
{"text":"Found this place on help, didn't read a single review. Ordered the Band Bang chicken bowl... Delicious! Perfect portion sizes, I will be back."}
{"text":"The chicken was good but fries are burnt. For the price you pay for it and half is bad :( check your orders to go before you leave :)"}
{"text":"Ok..the name is a little misleading as one is to easily think its a 'meal prep' restaurant. At least that was my assumption. This too is located in The Gramercy & if you read my other review the location has a lot to offer and is still new to a sense as to why you may never make your way in but I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed!   I wasn't planning on eating but as I was sitting outside and seeing and smelling all the different types of food and spices wisp by I easily convinced myself that I was hungry. The staff was beyond friendly and willing to go above & beyond the norm grab & go place. Portion Control offers an array of  dishes & variety of different protein options you can swap out. I enjoyed how they marked the menu with some 'favorites' and even had some vegan entrees if not vegan ingredients available.  Truly a place for all types of eaters; from the pickiest of peeps to the advocate foodie, I can guarantee will find something your taste buds will thank you for later!  Today's selection: Turkey Chopped Salad minus the turkey and substituted grilled shrimp; $16. They do not skimp out on their shrimp here! They are huge & delicious! The sauce is a creamy vegan ranch & not at all overpowering. I could taste all the flavor in each bite. To me, that's always a win!  PS: No menus are available but if you follow them on FB you can see what they offer for their portion meals but for the meals they serve in-house or to-go, well...you are just going have to go & check it out for your self!"}
{"text":"This place is so good that it is sometimes hard to believe that it is healthy for you!  Rather it be after a workout, for meal prep or even a family dinner, this place is fantastic.  Personal favorites are either the salmon or ahi tuna with skilled seared sweet potatoes!  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Delicious!Clean,fresh,& very tasty.   My gf invited me here for lunch yesterday,but didn't tell me it was a \"healthy\" restaurant because she knew I would pass. But,after having the turkey burger & tofu fry's I am hooked & im looking into the pre packaged meals.   Well done !"}
{"text":"Portion control is on point. Don't come if you're hungry. Only downfall is the wait. 30+ for a single item and that's carry out. Food is great!"}
{"text":"Convenient, but does not taste very good.  Seems like they make everything spicy to hide the blandness.  But it's still bland and the meat is dry.  I'll stick with Greens and Proteins and Daily Kitchen."}
{"text":"Happy this opened up in the gramercy!  We always love trying new, fresh, and healthy options.  The place is located right next to The Cuppa.  They have a lot of options.  I ordered the Club wrap, side of sweet potato fries, and tomato soup.  I over ordered!  The portions are large- just a heads up.  You definitely get your money's worth, which is nice.  They didn't have fountain drinks available, only water.  The decor is cute and the service was okay!  I'll be back here soon to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! My husband and I just moved from Oahu, here to Henderson. There was a few health style places out there but nothing like this. My husband I love how clean and modern the place looks, as well as the menu options! We've both only been there twice so far. Both times we had breakfast. Which was amazing! I had the California breakfast burrito. Tasted fresh and clean, didn't taste greasy."}
{"text":"Delicious. Found it through yelp. I've tried all the \"spots\" for healthy meals. This is definitely one of the tastiest ones! I just wish they had calorie counts.  But all in all it was great!"}
{"text":"So I'm doing the 6 week challenge at raw and this restaurant caters to the food that we can eat. I heard it's really good, so since I am so limited with restaurants I decided to take the drive out there. The decor was really nice, they had tv displays of the menu and foods that they offered. The staff was amazing and super friendly as well. I got the shepherds pie with sweet potato mash and my mom got the chicken Caesar wrap with sweet potato fries. Our food was beyond amazing! This is really a unique spot for clean healthy food. I will definitely be back during and after my challenge!"}
{"text":"I tried Portion Control at the recommendation of a couple of coworkers and they were spot on. I use their service because I found that I'm spending more money to buy groceries and cook for one person than what I would spend on 10 meals a week plus snacks from Portion Control. Food is super flavorful, the portions were way bigger than I expected, and the menu is really diverse. I love that they also have a restaurant to grab a bite at as well. If you're like me and short on time or desire to cook for yourself, this service is worth it."}
{"text":"Between work, the gym, and an infant; meal prep was such an inconvenience on sundays for me. I finally said 'enough' I didn't have the time or energy and honestly prepping was stressing me out. I'm so glad I did some research on meal preps here in Vegas. I looked at probably 10 different companies and portion control seemed to be the most reasonably priced with good reviews. I ordered last week and was very impressed with the flavor of everything. The chicken strips were not like the picture and the breading wasn't crispy, but with a fork and knife, they were still delicious. Just placed my order again today for this coming week. And now I'm getting hungry just writing this. Lol."}
{"text":"I love that I can come in here and grab something from their menu or completely make up my own meal. The flavors are very different than any other health food I've had. The food actually DOES have flavor, some places don't. Or some places mislead you and call it health food, but then give you a big side of mayo or sauce that you probably shouldn't be eating. Everything is made from fresh, natural ingredients. I'm not mad."}
{"text":"I'll try this again ... apparently you can't say who recommended your establishment.  So, the food here is fantastic!  I enjoy eating such healthy food at a great price!  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They will make modifications for you as you need to fit your dietary needs!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken adobo but apparently got chicken verde. Double check orders before leaving. Seems to be a problem. The food was good, but knocked a star off for wrong order. A little on the pricer side."}
{"text":"Love the oatmeal chicken fingers, I don't feel that they were infused with any Franks. There was 0 spice. I substituted with sweet potato fries which were delicious. The other part of my order was chicken adobo, apparently it was substituted with romaine lettuce. They don't tell you, they just do it. With the CDC recommendations on romaine lettuce, I would have like to have been offered a choice. The taste is ok, not worth 10+ dollars. The chicken verde is good. When I first had it at the other location it was served with cabbage, this one was given with broccoli, no consistency between locations. Also prices online don't match what I was charged. I would double check your receipt before you pay. When I called to complain, Aaron took care of it, but it seems a little more oversight needs to be done."}
