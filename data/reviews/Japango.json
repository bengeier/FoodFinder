{"text":"This is some of the better sushi in Toronto, but that's unfortunately not saying much.  I had take-out from Japango this evening, ordering only specials: yellowtail, uni, and horse mackerel.  The yellowtail was good, the uni excellent, but the horse mackerel was dried out and gave off the smell of too-old fish (and yes, I know that mackerel is an oily \"fishy\" fish even when fresh).  The ohitashi side dish featured spinach which hadn't been washed - plenty of crunchy dirt/sand in there.   I'll wait 'til I go to Vancouver, NYC, Seattle, or Chicago to have sushi again."}
{"text":"I've been twice in these place.  Both experiences were terrific. Sashimi was super fresh. O turo was delicios. The japanango rolls were also amazing. I recomend this place, they have the best sashimi ever!"}
{"text":"This place isn't really Japango, it's Koreango ;)  I mean they do a good job making sushi and I guess it is okay sushi for Toronto. The problem is they don't serve really authentic good sushi AND although their location is convenient, the place is too tiny to just drop by without reservation. So there isn't a reason to come back... They seem to owned by same owner/company? as the Yuzu no Hana. Yuzu is better."}
{"text":"We were in the area one day and yelped the restaurants near by. Japango seemed to have received a pretty good review so we gave it a try. I got a bento box for lunch. The portion is relatively smaller to the bento boxes I had at other places, however, it is still a decent size. The food was fantastic, I actually think it's the best bento box that I've ever had.   The only thing is that my friend is allergic to sesame, and we have informed our waitress about it when we put in our order. She brought the salad that came with the sushi roll my friend ordered. We weren't sure about whether it has any sesame in the dressing, so we asked another waitress who happened to be near by. The other waitress actually told us that it DOES contain sesame, and helped us to switch it for something else.   Perhaps the restaurant could be more diligent about allergies."}
{"text":"First of all - such a SMALL PLACE!! I imagine it can fit like 20 ppl max.. wonder how they make enough money.  We ordered a yellow fin roll (?) - I can't quite remember as it was very mediocre, portion was very small too. Good part of the meal was the Deluxe Sashimi platter - very impressed! They had good selection of fresh fishes. The pieces were medium sized too, so you don't pay almost $40 for a few thin slices.   Wait staffs were friendly too."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and crowd sometimes, but the food is great. Sashimi is refreshing, heard that all food ingredients aired straight from tokyo, and it offers THE best toro I ever had. The grilled eel took long time to be served but it was incredible tender, worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure which japango people are going to saying they are rude but it cannot be this one. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Menu is reasonably priced, there are many more expensive places around but this place is a nice middle ground.  Now the food, simply fantastic, the best sushi I have ever had which may not be saying too much but I can never go back to all you can eat. Fish was very fresh and the rice was cooked perfectly. I really cannot recommend this place enough.  Only negative is that it is a rather small place, so no sushi bar for a more intimate dining setting with the sushi chef and the tables are quite close to one another. Also the tea is fantastic, waitress said it was a mixture of green tea and brown rice. I should have asked for the recipe!"}
{"text":"Sushi resto fav!!  Tempura Dinner (perfect for two) Live Scallops (to die for!!) Asian Pear Salad (with soft tofu and ginger sesame dressing)  The restaurant itself is quite small, but its so charming."}
{"text":"I have no comment about the food since I did not get the opportunity to even be seated. The server was very rude from the moment I arrived. I felt like I was getting kicked out of the restaurant. My experience at japango was most distasteful despite the short time I spent there.   I arrived alone as my friend was looking for parking. The server cut me off mid sentence as I was asking for a table for two, informing him my friend is on his way. He told me I can't get a table until my partner is here. A few minutes later he told me there is a table for us but we would only have 30 minutes to eat... \"but your partner isn't here anyways so... \" Few minutes after that, he came over again and told me I should make a reservation for next time, that I was in the way, and if I'm going to wait I should wait next door. My friend was 10 minutes late. I don't think I should feel like I'm getting kicked out of a restaurant for waiting inside for 10 minutes. There most definitely won't be a next time."}
{"text":"One of the very best sushi places in Toronto. Amazing service, always great selection of fresh fish. Their chef's choice dinner is a real treat. Some of my favourites include their tuna tartar appetizer, the Japango roll  and the soft shell crab roll.  On the drawback side this place is pretty small and gets busy fast!"}
{"text":"SUPER FRESH SUSHI! Japango is easily one of the best sushi restaurants that Toronto has to offer. A little on the pricier side but you get what you pay for!  Japango takes reservations, which is quite helpful given that the place is super tiny.  If you come here for lunch, check out their bento boxes (great bang for your buck!). Comes with miso soup, salad, seaweed salad, pickled vegetables, and your choice of sushi/sashimi/tempura/other. On top of this, we usually get the Japango roll - highly recommend! You will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"The fish was very fresh - presentation was excellent, variety was good and staff was very friendly. This restaurant definitely serves authentic and fresh japanese food! We ordered a variety of sushi and sashimi and the quality was excellent! Although the restaurant was very busy, small, and cramped, the taste of the food made up for all those other things. I had an enjoyable dinner and what stood out the most to me here was how Japango resembled the Japan feeling, and made eating feel warmer."}
{"text":"The namesake japango roll is tastey, make sure to try the black sesame ice cream if you like sweets."}
{"text":"A small, cozy neighborhood gem a midst the pandemonium of all you can eat sushi and Chinese restaurants.  The Chirashi here is simply amazing. I especially enjoy how the tuna sashimi pieces are lightly seared to bring out extra flavor.  Sometimes the chefs would throw in free hand rolls on the house, which always brighten up a long work day.  I would prefer the place to be a bit bigger as seating is very limited, but perhaps that would take away Japango's distinguish vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"$$$  a small restaurant with an old smelling tree, broken shades on lamps $ 20 for four pieces of old and tasteless fish    what good is it: - the presentation of the food  bad:  - old repeatedly frozen fish soup was barely tepid and tea - a different story altogether  - almost cold and the water from the tap - with the smell of chlorine ... then another two hours chlorine smell in the mouth    (for 20 dollars  -   can very delicious attempt at Yuki Sushi  (Yuki Japanese & Korean Restaurant 3259 Dufferin St Toronto, ON M6A 2T4)  and be happy from delicious and fresh fish! )"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place when I'm in the downtown Toronto area. The fish here is always fresh and they have a wide variety as well (Japanese uni, Striped Jack, Horse Mackerel etc...).   Like other reviewers have said, seating is limited (but for someone like myself I prefer that at times) so make sure to make reservations, even if your 5-10 minutes away.   My favourite menu items are the sushi deluxe, chirashi supreme (which usually comes with uni) and Sushi and Sashimi Moriawase.   The chefs here are great and very friendly. Make sure to say hi and once they get to know what you like, they go out of their way to take care of you.   I highly recommend this place to any lover or new comer to sushi. Fresh fish, wide selection and fair prices make this place a gem in a city filled with many sushi options!!"}
{"text":"WARNING!!!  Don't go there without a reservation!  Even if the non-Japanese manager/owner offers you a seat, don't go in!  Because once you go in and get settled, he will tell you that you only have 45 minutes before the next reservation comes.  And if you take time on reading the menu, he'll say you only have 40 minutes left.  And if you argue with him, he'll kick you out without an apology.  It's a trick to get you inside so that he can fill in that 45 min of empty table / 45 min empty income!  He knows that if he had said 45 min right in front of the door you would not go in.  This is not an authentic Japanese restaurant.  Even if it might tastes authentic, the hospitality is totally unauthentic."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! And that's what the star is for. Too bad I can't give negative stars or else I would have!   I been to this place a few times and I do have to admit their fish is fresh but on the pricey end, also it's a super tiny place, tables are close together so u don't get much privacy    My friends bday is coming up and I saw on Yelp they they have omakase, today around 8pm I walked by the restaurant so decided to drop in to ask for more details About their omakase. I know omakase it's chef selection of whatever is fresh that night so I wasn't even going to ask them what's on the omakase menu, all I wanted to know is the price. I went in and told them I saw pics of their omakase online and asked for more details (how much it is per person) the waited asked when I wanted to book the table for and I said end of Jan (3 weeks away) then his response to my question was 'call us and ask, I don't have time for u now' WOWWWW EXCUSE ME???? WHAT KINDA OF SERVICE IS THIS??!!?!? I know the restaurant is always packed and getting a lot of business so they don't mid losing a few customers but u just don't treat customers like this! Then I repeated my question, I told him I'm not asking what's on the menu, just want to know the price...he then repeated himself again and said ' I told u to call us and ask, u didn't hear me the first time??' By that time I just turned around and head straight out. NOT GOING TO CALL AND ASK CAUSE U KNOW WHAT? I DONT CARE ANYMORE, DOESNT MATTER WHAT THE PRICE IS, THE ATTITUDE OF YOUR WAITERS RUINED IT ALL. BYE BYE JAPANGO, U JUST LOST A CUSTOMER, DONT THINK I WILL EVER RETURN TO YOU GUYS."}
{"text":"Place seats about 36 peeps in total, so the beyond cozy seating makes for an intimate late dinner experience. Will give the couple sitting beside us about a month more, maybe less. Neighbor couple's sour attitude aside, we found the chef's option selection of sashimi to be well portioned and very beautifully prepared. Tip: be courteous and respectful and you'll be treated the same. Don't and the host/waiter may see that you don't get a table. Really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Japango is now my favourite Sushi place in Toronto.   Was here at 3pm on a Tuesday with one other person so there was no wait time at. Two of the other tables were occupied by other patrons, and noone was sitting right next to us so it didn't seem cramped at all. The service was a little slow, but that's about my only complaint.  The scallops seared in butter with ponzu sauce were mind-blowingly good! So much so that we ordered another of those right away. The best spicy salmon rolls i have ever had as well - complex, good texture, fresh fish. We ordered another one of these as well. Perhaps it would have been wiser to try more things in hindsight, but we didn't think anything else could be EVEN better than this.   The Japango roll was good too, but  I think the white tuna was flash grilled for this, and I am not a fan of my sushi rolls being warm. We also ordered oysters on the half shell, which were fresh but had a more mineral and fishy taste than any other oysters I have had before. I liked the texture and flavours added in, but the variety of oysters used was probably not my favourite.   I'd definitely go back again to try some more stuff to come up with my list of favourites. Maybe there IS hope for good sushi in Toronto that isn't ridiculously expensive."}
{"text":"Coming in here, I was really shocked at how small this place is. I've been to some super tiny Japanese restaurants but this by far is the smallest. I'd say at any one point there can be 15-20 diners, but it would be really squishy. Unfortunately, this night when I came here with Rob, that was exactly how it was. The seating wasn't very comfortable as the tables were really up close against your legs. In addition to that, you are really close to the people sitting in the next tables. It only takes one loud person beside you to ruin your experience. Luckily, there were no such people tonight.   \"Japango Roll\" ($12): This is probably the most famous item on the menu. Almost every review will recommend this roll, so I figured I had to try it. It definitely did not disappoint. In essence it was a california roll with roe, seared salmon, and seared scallop on top. The sauce had a bit of a subtle spicy kick to it, and it was rolled nice and tight. I found this roll to be extremely delicate. It is so light and fluffy and it just disappears in your mouth. the seared scallops were warm and cooked on the outside, but still quite raw and cool on the inside. An interesting sensation.    \"Sashimi Dinner Deluxe\" ($32.00): We opted to order the Deluxe instead of the regular sashimi dinner because the waitress said the Deluxe comes with a more expensive caliber of fish. Not only did it come with the regular salmon and tuna, it had hamachi, seabream, and other less common fishes. I was really impressed by the presentation, variety, and quality of the fish. Some of the peices were actually seared on the outside and it tasted like it was done in seasoned oil. It added a really nice flavour to it. The fish were really fresh, but definitely not as fresh as Inakaya.    \"Ten Jaru\" ($14.00) -Soba noodles with Tempura : By the time this dish came me and rob were already quite full. We definitely did not expect this dish to be so massive! It cames with a huge pile of piping hot tempura, and a generous serving of soba noodles placed on a bamboo roll out mat. At first I thought that fin-looking piece of tempura out was a fish tail of some sort. Turns out it was an eggplant cut to resemble it! Kudos to the details. The most interesting part of this, was the sauce. They give you a quail egg, scallions, and wasabi to mix into your soba noodle sauce. I've never had it this way, but it tasted really good!   By the end of this, I was stuffed. I really enjoyed this meal and there isn't much to complain about in terms of food. The staff here have a little bit of a japanese accent, but their service was amazing despite the numerous take out orders they had to manage on top of serving the restaurant. They really go the distance here with food presentation, and it's something I find adds to the great dining experience."}
{"text":"They say \"never say never\" but Japango? I say... Never. Ever. Again.  TDLR: I found a cockroach in my salad and they called it a \"vegetable bug\".  My friends and I visited Japango last night. Our plan was to visit another restaurant but that did not work out, so we settled for Japango last-minute because it was nearby, and it seemed to have pretty good reviews on Yelp. At 4:30 PM, the three of us were the first ones to sit down for dinner. My first thought as I stepped into the restaurant was how small and cramped this place is. The chefs greeted us from the sushi bar as they were preparing for dinner service, then a waitress showed us to a table and gave us hot tea.  Among the three of us, we ordered two chirashi dinners and three rolls: Japango, crunchy spicy salmon, and spider.   We started with two bowls of salad, which was included in the chirashi dinners. It was the same kind of salad that other Japanese restaurants typically serve, but their dressing was more gingery than usual. As I was about to pick up the last bite of my salad with my chopsticks, I noticed something black, and it seemed unusually out of place. I took a closer look at it, and it was something I have never seen in my food before.   EVER.  There, at the bottom of my salad, laid a dead cockroach. Squished. In the corner. It was a little less than 1 cm long.   I was shocked. I showed it to my friend as soon as I realized what it was, and I had to ask her, \"Is this for real..?\" She could not believe it either.  I really should have taken a picture of the dead cockroach in my salad. However, in that moment, taking a picture did not cross my mind. I have had hair and plastic in my food before, but...a bug? A cockroach? Are you kidding me? I showed one of the waiters my salad bowl and his immediate response was, \"Oh my gosh...\"  He returned a few minutes later, and informed us that he showed it the chef. Apparently, the chef's response was, \"The bug is not from the kitchen, but it is a vegetable bug.\" I was speechless. (We thought of this as we were walking out the door, but we really should have asked him, \"Do you not wash your vegetables then?\")  I sort of lost my appetite...  The waiter came back with complimentary seaweed salad, as well as shrimp and vegetable tempura for the table. My friends would not touch the seaweed salad because they felt another bug could easily go unnoticed. I love seaweed salad and it looked safe, so I did have a little bit. As for the tempura, I only had a shrimp tempura and I thought there was way too batter for such a small shrimp.  With regard to the chirashi dinners, the presentation was nice and the rice had a bit of flavour to it. However, other than the lightly torched butterfish, I did not like the sashimi and it is THE most important part of a chirashi dinner. I felt the fish was not that fresh and it was not served at the right temperature. It definitely did not taste chilled. For $21, this was far from my expectation. (Fune is quite a walk from here, but it is well worth it. Their fish is fresh and their chirashi dinner is actually less expensive.)  The Japango roll looked good and tasted decent. It was quite unique. From what I remember, there was red tobiko, lightly torched scallop sashimi, and salmon sashimi on top of an avocado, cucumber, and imitation crabmeat roll, drizzled with spicy mayo and teriyaki sauce. The other two rolls were unimpressive. They were poorly constructed, particularly the crunchy spicy salmon roll, and all I could taste in the crunchy spicy salmon was how spicy it was. The chef did put some effort into the presentation of the spider roll, but that was not enough to make up for small loosely rolled sushi that lacked in taste.   All in all, Japango was a huge disappointment. I am sad to discover that a restaurant with a 4-star rating on Yelp would serve a salad with a cockroach in it and call it a \"vegetable bug\". I am never coming back here again. I would not give them any stars if I could."}
{"text":"We went in during the latter part of the lunch rush (2 people). We had to wait for a bit, but were seated inside the small cozy place in under 15 minutes. We both ordered the lunch bento special, which comes with chef's choice of sushi, salad, some tempura and miso soup. The sushi was fresh and the cooked eel has a slight grease oil aftertaste, but it gave a nice buttery flavour. Weird i know, but I enjoyed it.  Overall, good place for a la carte sushi."}
{"text":"I have been back here three times now, and I find it to be, perhaps, the best quality sushi I have ever eaten.  To be fair, I have never been to Japan, or even Vancouver, but I have eaten a lot of sushi in my life and haven't tried anything quite as delectable as Japango's lightly seared butterfish (ibodai).  I had to close my eyes while savouring it, it really was that good. The place is very small, so not good for big groups, but the atmosphere is really friendly and the staff are super attentive and nice.  They'll even give you your own chopsticks and keep them behind the bar for you to use when you come if you're a regular.  Everything I've had there so far has been beyond good - the salad, the sushi, the maki, the sashimi, and the tempura are all at least one step above what you would get at most similarly-priced sushi restaurants.  I do not hesitate in giving this place 5 awesome stars."}
{"text":"really small and tight but personally - I love that aspect of it. I think if they moved to a larger location, a lot of the elbow-to-elbow charm would be lost in the transition. the food is fantastic. service is great. my favourite japanese restaurant in toronto so far   BE SURE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS BEFOREHAND. especially on weekends, most people will be turned away for lack of space."}
{"text":"Got takeout lunch here today. Service was friendly but they gave me two miso soups instead of a soup and salad. They also changed the price of their lunch chirashi or overcharged us. Either way it is not reflected on the menu and we were not informed. Furthermore the cuts of fish were very unevenly sized. Some huge, some slivers."}
{"text":"I rarely write scathing yelp reviews unless the situation was absolutely awful - this lack of dining experience deserved zero stars.   My boyfriend and I walked into Japango on Sunday night around 8:15pm, two tables of 2 were open. There were 2 chefs behind the counter, 1 server chatting/laughing with the chefs speaking Japanese, 1 server putting dishes away behind the chefs - NO ONE GREETED US AT THE DOOR OR ACKNOWLEDGED OUR ARRIVAL   They all stood around as if no new customers had just stepped into the restaurant. The place is tiny, it's very easy to detect when a new person has walked inside. Two empty two-person tables were also open!!  Two uber eats drivers walked in shortly after our arrival and the server spoke to them about their pick up's and continued to ignore the two dining customers standing beside the door.   After standing around for nearly 10 minutes we decided to leave. Typical Japanese restaurants will say goodbye to customers, needless to say Japango staff ignored us as we stepped outside."}
{"text":"Always have Sashimi and wow was this ever good. Chose the Deluxe option and the blow torch put a BBQ flavour on the white fish proved divine. Seating is crammed but appropriate next to the bus depot kind of like eating on a train car all of four meters wide. Service was exceptional even with all the takeout orders that are prepared from the same sushi bar. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that has to take a bus out of town."}
{"text":"For al, the people giving 5 stars, have you really been to any decent, authentic sushi place? I ordered a few sashimis and appetizers. The sea urchin, when fresh, should have a sweet and briny taste of sea. The on we had however, smell and taste like fish gut left out for days. No one touched it for a second time.  The sashimi platter, the Delux one, is so small. How small? Imagine a Lintt chocolate ball cut into three pieces, that's how small each piece is!  After about an hour into our dinner, the waiter kept asking what else to you order, aka, 'we can to kick your ass out unless you order more\". Don't get me wrong, I believe 3 person for $120 order is sufficient amount.  Very disappointed! Will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in the city!  Fresh fish-you can taste the difference.  Unique one of a kind dishes, that give you an awesome food experience!"}
{"text":"Food 5/5 Experience 3/5  I lived across the street from here for a year and we were the most devoted fans. We loved, loved, loved their sushi and went to the restaurant regularly.   I would just say:  (1) the atmosphere is very very cramped   (2) amazingly, we went there about once a week for a whole year, and the staff never acknowledged us or gave us any sense that they knew who we were. We naively thought we'd get our own set of chopsticks (they're given to regulars), but we realized quickly that wasn't in the cards. The final time we went they were just as cold and plastic to us as the first time.   (3) They are on a tight schedule and try to get you out of the restaurant as fast as possible (sometimes as fast as 30 minutes for dinner). It feels very transactional.  Our favourite dishes: - Chirashi, which they would adjust for us on a custom basis - Spicy crunchy salmon and tuna rolls - Spicy salmon hand roll"}
{"text":"The service here is HORRENDOUS. Don't count on getting a table even if you have a reservation because they will give your table away. Staff members are rude and unapologetic. Food is decent but definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"I didn't order any sushi or sashimi because my co-workers are not that fond of nigiri style... so we ordered 5 rolls and shared.  The rolls are delicious and the white wine pairs up the roll well.  Japango roll (salmon + scallop on a california roll) is a must get.  This is a very small place... not recommended for groups of more than 4 people.    The best part of the meal?  Black sesame ice cream!  It has strong sesame smell and is one of the best black sesame ice cream I have ever tasted.  Not too many restaurants offer it (usually you get green tea or red bean).  I would say this is probably a must order item if one is to come here."}
{"text":"Food is great, but horrendous service.  Came with with my fiancé and mom for Mother's Day dinner.  Made a reservation for 6:00pm.  Dropped my mom at the front of the restaurant at 5:55pm while my fiancé and I went to find parking.  I figured she could get seated first.  Parked at a nearby green P lot and went to the restaurant to see my mom standing by the door.  This was 6:04pm.  The waiter told me our whole party needed to be present before we could be seated.  I replied \"I'm 5 mins late\".  He said \" even if you're 1 min late, you have to call and let us know\".  Totally understandable as it's a very small restaurant. So I told him \" I understand, sorry\".  He then lead us to our table and CONTINUED to lecture me about how it doesn't matter if the guest is the owner's friends or family or even celebrities, everyone has to obey the rules.  I told him again that I understand.    While seated, my mom told me that the same waiter had asked her to wait outside the restaurant before the whole dinner party arrives.  She doesn't take up much space.  I told my mom that that was pretty rude of the waiter but the restaurant has its rules and let's just enjoy the dinner.  We ordered 2 agedashi tofu, 2 rolls, 2 deluxe sashimi dinners and 1 Japango deluxe dinner set.  The deluxe dinner comes with 4 nigiri sushi, 6 pieces of California maki and ice cream (this fact comes into play later on).  The food was delicious, sashimi was fresh and good varieties of texture.  Towards the end of dinner, we had 1 piece of sashimi left on the plate and the waiter swooped in, grabbed it and toss a piece of crumpled up receipt onto the plate and put it right in front of the sushi bar.  I'm seeing all this as this is a very small restaurant so everything is happening right in front of my eyes.  The waitress saw this the same time I did and quickly picked up the crumpled receipt and handed back the plate to my table and apologized.  Not 2 mins later, the same waiter came to try to take the plate away!!! This time I told him \" hey there's still food on the plate\". He quickly put down the plate and offered a half ass apology while looking at another table. Y'know the kind of apology where the mouth says \"sorry\" but the body language says \"whatever dude\"?  Yeah, that was the apology I got.  The waitress came by later to ask if we're ready for the ice cream, I told her that we did not get the nigiri and California rolls.  At this point, I'm like seriously?  She checked with the sushi chefs and sure enough, they forgot to make them.  Yip.  Food is great but I would not return for the terrible service."}
{"text":"The best sushi around for the money.  Although more expensive than the sushi joints found on every block in downtown Toronto, the fish is also much tastier and fresher.  Whenever my partner and I want sushi, we almost invariably come here.  Although the set dinners are nice, we prefer to order a la carte.  There is a menu of seasonal and fresh items that change every week and we usually start off with a couple of orders off of that menu.  Last time we were there, we had the sea bream from Japan, sea bream from Greece, Uni, hirame, yellowtail.  The Uni and yellowtail were TO DIE FOR!!!  Melt in your mouth goodness.  Not a hint of fishiness in sight.  We took a friend with us who doesn't usually eat uni, forced the uni on her, and she instantaneously became a fan.  That's how good it was.    Outside of the specials, I would highly recommend the butterfish which often, as the name suggests, melts in your mouth like butter.  The Spicy BC Tuna hand roll is quite good as well.  Although I'm not usually a fan of the modern rolls (like my stuff traditional), the Japango roll is, I admit, very nice.  We almost always order it and I would recommend that you give it a try too.    The best thing about Japango is that not only is the fish fresh, but the rice is done properly.  Too often in Toronto, we are subjected to sushi rice that is either too hard or too soggy.  Too much vinegar or too much sugar.  The rolls are usually the worst with rice that is packed so hard, my intestines hurt after eating a piece.  Japango's chefs know how to make their rice properly.  Each nigiri and roll is made with fluffy white rice that melts in your mouth at the same time as the fish.  The nigiri is properly, bite-sized, not like the humungous pieces that most other sushi places offer.  The rolls are also properly done without being packed too hard.   The cooked food, although limited, is also good.  We enjoy the soft shell crab once in a while and an order of tempura, both well done and not soggy.    The only downside is the cramped space.  However, it does approximate the real feel of a Japanese sushi bar.  If you can, make reservations for dinner.    All in all, a place I go back to again and again and again despite promises to try other sushi joints in the city."}
{"text":"So here I am, tryna figure out where I should get lunch and then here comes Japango! Fuckin delicious AND adorable (these are my two main criteria for Japanese food). The lunch special comes with all these side nibbles (there were like 6 mini-sides), some of which I couldn't identify. But that didn't stop me from eating them. And loving them. And wanting more of them (yellow thing with black and white sesame seeds? Call me.) And the lunch comes in the cutest plastic bento to-go box. I got the maki combo. It was bomb. I subbed out the cali roll for a spicy crunchy tuna because fake crab is skeevy and they charged me like a buck or something. For a way fancier roll. Also, I got that shit to go because Japango is like the size of a post-it note. But cute things have to be tinier. Bottom line: YUMMY-SAN."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service. Extremely cramped seating. Neighboring lunchers found a piece of hair in their food. Miso soup on that day was also way too salty."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi in Toronto, that we tried by now.  Service is extremely good (arriving on time, just as we finish one plate, the next is coming). We arrived for our reservation, but there was no available table and we waited for some time, so the stuff apologized about 5 times for that and gave a small free sushi plate.  The place is quite small (7 tables) and cosy. Overall : very good. Recommended."}
{"text":"Stay away from this restaurant.   I can promise you if you want good sushi, there are other great authentic places in the city like Nami and Sagano. First time I cam here, they threw the bill on the table 15 minutes after our food had arrived. That was small inconvenience so I still came back for a second chance. Service was even worse. We arrived on time according to my phone. And he said we were 2 minutes late according to his clock and told us to wait an hour or leave his establishment. As we walked out, he called after us and said \"I'm sorry you don't understand policies and rules\" in the most condescending tone. Honestly, why would you pay to eat here to be treated like garbage? It's not like their sushi is made of gold. Would rather eat in a dumpster."}
{"text":"I'd been to Japango once before and remembered the ultra small, cozy atmosphere and the food being top notch. At that time, it was late summer and I was seated with 3 others at the first table right next to the door, which made for a very tight fit! We laughed about it and had an incredible meal of some of the freshest and largest portions of sushi that I've had to date. For my 2nd visit, this time in winter (Feb.17th), I was again seated at the same table at the door along with two other friends. Immediately upon entering, we could feel the heat slap us in the face as though we were hopping in to a steam room. For such a tiny place and a mild evening outside, we couldn't understand the reason for such an overdose of warmth. So, I politely asked the male waiter to turn the extra heater off that they had right in front of the door and he obliged, though stated that the heater was there because the table is close to the door. Well for the few moments that the door is open, I think most people can handle the slight breeze as compared to the discomfort and suffocating air from that blower.   We sat down and began perusing the menu when the waiter brought us tea. We asked for ice water as well and when he brought the water to the table, it had no ice and it was practically warm - maybe room temperature at best! I asked him for some ice and his reply was \"we don't have ice. the size of our restaurant doesn't allow us to have ice\". I'm sorry but all it takes is a couple small ice cube trays to be able to offer your customers a refreshing, cold glass of water - at the very least! Personally, I really do not like room temp. water at all and it's the bare minimum that any establishment should be able to offer. What are we, in India?!?   As we went about our order, we also asked for extra ginger since they never really bring you enough but for 2 pieces of sushi. The waiter brought us a very small bowl and that was gone very quickly so we asked for more which he didn't overly pleasantly bring to us. We felt as though we were putting him out which we should never have felt in any restaurant when asking for such a thing. To top it off, the heat was still excessively high and - may I remind you - this place is about as big as your walk-in closet and bathroom combined so the body heat alone is enough to stifle you. One of my friends requested that he turn it down a bit as it was still very uncomfortable but he responded with \"we've been doing the same thing for 20 years and never had a problem\"....well hey we all know how complacent people can be to just accept situations that are less than what they should be. He didn't turn it down and in the meantime, he was rushing every table and any new people coming in by telling them the time limit they had - not exactly a warm, welcoming feeling!   So while the food is quite good quality - the unagi melts in your mouth! - the service and atmosphere is severely lacking! Like seriously, get some freaking ice cube trays; turn off the bloody heat when it's +5 outside and your space is the size of a closet; bring your guests what they ask for with a smile; and start being more considerate of your customer's feelings and suggestions. The only other good thing worth mentioning was at least they weren't playing god awful top 40 or edm like most restaurants. But that aside, it wasn't enough to make our experience that worthy of going back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for sushi and sashimi! Warning: the place is very small with limited seating, highly recommend booking a reservation.  The staff are always friendly and open to conversation. The fish are very fresh and the cuts are amazing. The place is a little pricey but I'm always willing to spend money on good food. Definitely recommend the chirashi or sashimi sets, you can see the care the chefs put into preparing the food."}
{"text":"I usually don't bother to write reviews (good or bad), but I just had to say something about the negative experience I just had here.  Food wise, it was ok.  I've had worse, but it's DEFINITELY not on par with the premier sushi places in Toronto like Zen, Shoushin, Yasu or Kaji.  Service and attitude wise, this place suuuuuuuuuucks.  What kind of places puts all the food in the middle of the table to leave the diners to figure it out who gets what?  When we left, no one bothered to thank us or even say goodbye.  And while I have no issue with what the smug manager/waiter boy told us about not being able to seat us until everyone has arrived, or not being able to split a bill, it was his prissy attitude that bothered me most.  All in all, this place thinks it's hotter sh1t than it really us.  It needs a dose of reality and realize that it's just a middle of the road restaurant with meh food and poor service."}
{"text":"Tiny little restaurant with maybe twenty seats, but more than makes up for it in tasty Japanese cuisine. The place was packed on a Wednesday evening, and combined with its small size, made for quite a good atmosphere.   I had the deluxe sashimi, and interestingly some of it comes seared on the surface. Fish tasted fresh and 'sweet'. Only small complaints would be that my bowl of rice was a bit hard for some reason, and it is fairly pricey... but on balance, I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Excellent and tasty sushi. A bit expensive but worth the money. Good and fast service. Small and cosy."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in the city. If you call early enough, you can get a reservation and they have delicious everything. I like the servers too, very kind and attentive. We had sushi pizza, and a bunch of rolls. I really like the hamachi-green onion hand roll and the classic spicy salmon roll. Be sure to go early or reserve especially on a busy night (Thursday to Sunday) because it's a tiny place."}
{"text":"Didn't have a reservation when we came in, but they were able to seat us. I can see how you'd need one though, the place is pretty packed and tiny.  My sister and I ordered the japango roll, spicy salmon, tempura, miso soup among other things. I wish we'd been as smart as the people sitting next to us and ordered a japango roll each for ourselves...it was heavenly. We each saved our last piece for the very end. The other items were delicious as well.  I'm very used to AYCE sushi, so that might make me a tad unobjective, but I really don't think you can beat the quality here, especially for their namesake roll. Considering all we got (which was enough to make us pleasantly full), it still only came to about 20$ per person after taxes."}
{"text":"My co-worker has been raving about this place for the longest time, so I finally made my way over to Japango the other night. She told me it was small... but I didn't expect it to be that tiny! There isn't any sushi bar seating, the tables are only a few inches apart and the restaurant fits maybe 20 people MAX. But given how amazing the food was, I could've cared less.  I came with one other person, and since we had arrived shortly after 5:30, we were able to grab a table right away. We decided to share a few things including one order of the Sushi Sashimi Moriawase - Chef's choice of sushi and sashimi ($40). First came the sashimi platter which consisted of the following: - salmon belly - sea bream from Japan (seared on top) - fluke - bigeye tuna - butterfish (in a garlic sauce)  The sashimi was ridiculously good. Everything just tasted so fresh! The little things that they do - searing some of the fish, putting it in garlic sauce, etc, really brings out the flavour in the fish too.   Next came the sushi platter, which consisted of 2 pieces of each of the following: - sea bream from Greece (seared on top) - mackeral - uni - salmon - bigeye tuna  Similar to the sashimi, the fish was so fresh and delicious! No complaints whatsoever. The Moriawase also came with a green salad, miso soup and a sunomono.   We also ordered a seaweed salad ($5), which was tasty (I've rarely had it done poor though), but at $5 for a teeny tiny bowl, I thought this was overpriced. We weren't sure if we'd have enough food, so we also ordered an order of hamachi sashimi (one of the specials of the day) and a spicy scallop roll ($8). Both were delicious!  I didn't really try any of the hot food, but the sashimi and sushi certainly get 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"The sushi/sashimi, which is the most important is very good as everyone says. No wonder it is 4 stars.  I do want to point out that it is a tiny place with very cramped seating.... and i can hear everyone's conversations. Not a place for privacy. Another thing, this place does not have boats or anything for sharing. We had to order separate dishes for a make-shift boat lol Honestly I would have given three stars, but I guess the chef could overhear us looking for boats which they didn't have, and made us this really cute plate of tinyyyy sushi!!!! He was using chopsticks instead of fingers to piece them together because they were so small. A very nice gesture. Each piece was as small as the nail of my thumb."}
{"text":"Been there many times over the last few years but tonite was the last. One of the owners who's usually( man with glasses) serves us might have been having a bad night but I'm sorry that's no excuse. Stay home if u can't work well. I had made a reservation for 9 and got there at 845. It was full but while my wife and I were waiting I noticed another 2 women who had busted finished eating. They got up to leave and put there jackets on and the owner was very pushy and agitated with them even though they weren't taking there time. The we sat down and waited for him to come to our table. I know what it's like to work and eat at busy restaurant so I am understating if it might take him a lil longer to get to us. So I waited patiently without getting angry in any way. He finally got to us and I asked him some questioned but after 10 sec of asking he just turned and went to serve another table. He came back again around 1 min later and I asked him again since I didn't here his response and then I began to order and see was agitated again. I tried to finish quickly ordering. The person sitting next to us noticed and look at us and showed a funny face. I thought about it and then canceled the order and left with my wife. U can make ur own judgment but I wanted ppl to know !!!"}
{"text":"Took my mom for lunch for a mother-daughter lazy day. Ordered LOTS of sushi.  I was feeling adventurous and wanted to stay away from my \"usuals\". The tuna and avocado tartar was fresh and tasty.  Fried oysters inspired me to try it at home. So good! The sushi was melt-in-your-mouth. They offer omakase, which I'm sad to say I still have not experienced! I have to go back and have the chirashi (I've been craving it lately).  The owner, a very friendly woman who was running the sushi bar very well and keenly watching her clients as they increased in volume and hunger, sent over two spicy tuna temaki hand rolls. Very nice touch. I think she heard us speaking in Japanese, so there may have been some special treatment - but hell, I'll take two rolls on the house any time!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Let's put that aside for a moment, because in Toronto there are many fantastic sushi places, so food being \"good\" is not enough of a differentiation.  Service is HORRIBLE. I have been here about four times, always in off hours (like 2pm lunches or 4.30pm dinners). The service was never memorable, but not offensive either. This last time (and the last time I ever go to Japango), the service was down right atrocious. For the first time in my life I walked out of a restaurant!  Let me enumerate the trespasses: + Made a reservation four days before my dinner, since I wanted to bring my parents and I know it gets busy -- I called earlier the day of the dinner, to confirm. The reservation was not recorded in their books to they told me to \"try to show up at 6pm\". Zero apologies given. + I showed up at 6pm. The refuse to sit us until the last person in our party arrives, sitting one group before me, even though I mentioned about the unrecorded reservation. + We finally sit, and the passive-aggressive waiter says we have 35 minutes to eat because that table is reserved. Of course my blood boiled.. because I ALSO HAD MADE A RESERVO! + We diced to make the best of it, order four appetizers, three rolls, and one delux sashimi dinner for 4 people... the waiter comes back and tells me we need to order more, because \"appetizers don't count as dinner\"... then he said that 18% gratuity was included... + We get up and leave.  There are many delicious places in Toronto. Don't waste your time here. This place is ran by entitled, passive-aggressive chums with very little understanding of customer service or which side of the transaction they are it: They're not doing me a favour giving me food - I'm paying for it!"}
{"text":"While I don't necessarily have any complaints about this restaurant, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed considering the high ratings on yelp! I'm a vegetarian though, and only ordered veggie rolls, so this could be the reason. The quality was good, and the veggies were fresh, but I can't say this is the best sushi I've ever had. It may be different for those who eat fish though, possibly they have higher quality fish?  The service was good, but I wouldn't say excellent. The place is extremely small, and when we first got there we told them that we were waiting for 2 other people, and they let us wait with no hassle for over 20 minutes for our friends. The staff seemed friendly, but we had to ask for drinks and for tea refills.   Finally, the selection was not as good as I had hoped. There are bento box and plenty of other combos for lunch, however there were only a few dinner combos (and none offered for vegetarians) so most had to order individual maki.   I would go back, but I can't say this is my favourite!"}
{"text":"Ordered the moriawase (chef's selection of sushi/sashimi). Fish was extremely fresh, prepared well, and good portion size. I would preordering the omakase one day in advance the next time I visit, and you MUST make a reservation (small restaurant)"}
{"text":"Worst sushi experience during recent years. Use to be here a few times a year, and used to be good, the price is expensive but at least the quality used to be ok. But this time, the chef's choice sushi platter which is now 55 before tax are most low qualify fish like salmon and even butterfish ....  No scallops no sweet shrimp no Uni....  Also the waitress is so rude.... They only give 1 hour and 15 mins for a dinner, and because today is Saturday , only 1 hour for one round.....  Are u kidding me, 1 hour for a sushi dinner in a so claimed decent sushi restaurant ? No idea what's the cause of this change, but definitely no more visits in this place with so many choices like jabistro or Hana. Please try by yourself and feed back to verify."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I started going to this restaurant dated back in 2003! I used to always miss the lunch and dinners at the residents cafeteria and i'll come here for an even better meal!! My favourites are Japango Roll, their seafood udon in the hot stone pot and of course many many of their fresh sashimi!  But because I don't live around the corner anymore and the store is too small, it's really difficult to get a seat, so I usually just get take out these days.   Must try: Japango Roll"}
{"text":"Wow this place is an experience. It's small, quaint authentic and yummy. My friends and I did the 8 course special chef's selection. It started with some of the freshest tuna I've ever had, quail egg with an oyster and ended with amazing black cod and sesame ice cream. This place is a must visit got any sushi lover. Furthermore the chef is super nice and friendly and threw in a couple more delightful courses.   Japango also has very good sake. I particularly enjoyed their unfiltered kind. To attest to the great service, when they ran out of the lower grade sake we were hung they served us the nicer kind at the same cost. I defiantly hold a special spot for this lovely sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Japango. Despite the tight space & long wait time, it is so worth it. It's hard to find a good restaurant that maintains its quality of food over time, and Japango manages to stay consistent. Learn more about my experience here: http://yourstruly52.wordpress.com/thegoodbadtasty/"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of buzz about this place - from people; from Yelp. I have to say, in the famous words of Jim Carey in Liar Liar - \"I've had better\" == read my review about Aji Sai @ Spadina / Queen.  FOOD: - Good quality - sushi was fresh - Quantity sucked given the price. I mean, it's standard for a sushi order, but other things, like steamed beans or tempura = poor quantity. - Tempura was oily like the face of a pubertal 14-year old with a bad diet. I mean, I understand tempura's fried. But at least soak it on paper before serving it   Food rating: 3/5 (sushi = good; other stuff = meh...)  PRICE: - =O !!! - We had 3 orders of sushi, 1 tempura and 1 order of steamed beans. Paid 55 bucks + tax + gratuities.  - Given the quality of food, and the experience (read decor below), I wanted my money back. However, sadly, my appetite for the evening was \"non-refundable\".   Price rating: 3/5 (I am not pissed about the $65 bill (inclusive), but it didn't match up for the experience + food.   DECOR: - The interior design is nice = gives you the feeling of being in a quaint tiny Japanese eatery (I will admit: I have never been to Japan. I say by comparing it to movies) - But THAT was the problem = they took tiny to a whole new level of tiny. As a 6'2\" male, I could reach out for the food on 2 tables on either side. Seriously. It was worse than eating in economy class on air plane.  - For the money that they charge, they should either take out a few tables, or get some more space.   Decor rating: 1/5  SERVICE: - They take reservations. But they don't. Because I made a reservation. Upon asking, they graciously agreed to give me a seat near the window. 20 minutes later, when I arrived with my date, they tell me \"we did not get any phone call.. are you sure you had the right number?\". Yes. I did. Because when they answered the phone, they said, \"JapanGo?\". -_-. Not cool.  - It was at half-capacity when we were there (which, again, is like 4/8 tables, seating 2 people each). They must have flown in the fish fresh, because it does not take THAT long to make sushi.  - There were 2 servers waiting upon 8 tables. 2 more making sushi at the bar. I still could not find anyone to take another order for about 5-10 minutes. Or to tell them to get me the bill (the sushi-makers just told me to wait for the servers).   Service rating: 1/5.   All in all, there is no reason I would go there again. None. Absolutely none. Not even if it was free (because if someone was offering me a free sushi meal, I would convince them to treat me somewhere else). The food was okay, the experience was crap. Not paying 50+ bucks for that. No sir."}
{"text":"I've probably eaten here twenty or so times in the past decade (first went back in '06 or '07). There's nothing even close to the same quality of sushi in the area. Anyone calling this place an average sushi place needs to stop ordering wack ass rolls, get a Chirashi, then come talk to me. I had to double-take when I saw they put up a sign reminding people it wasn't an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, but when I realized how close it was to Yonge/Dundas, I empathized. Do yourself a favour, treat this place as a proper $$ and you'll be rewarded. Also, if you have a group of more than 4 people, I wouldn't even bother unless it's off-peak hours."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi!  I was looking for a sushi restaurant in the area, and actually wandered over to to Yuzu on Adelaide Street West first. But I wasn't impressed - the place was half-empty at dinner time (not a good sign!) and the roll I had was just OK. So, I decided to walk the mile or so to Japango to see if it had more my cup of tea.  As you'll read in other reviews, this place is SMALL! No sushi bar at all, and only a few tables. The place was jam-packed - standing room only. But the food was absolutely fantastic. The yellow tail sashimi blew me away - it melted in my mouth, and was really just superb. I had the spicy tuna roll as well, and was very pleased with it.  I also ordered some tako (they were out), hokkigai (same thing), ika, and uni. All of the plates came out as they were ready, and were not served all together. I appreciated this, but is probably due to the fact that the chefs were busy as heck!  Not much more to say about this place, except that it's certainly on my list of places to visit when I'm away from Boston."}
{"text":"Craving authentic sushi?  Then Japan-Go now!  (but not without a reservation - limited seating).  Once I had eaten at Japango, I had realized what delicious and fresh sushi should be.  Each order is not only prepared to perfection and with care, but also presented like a work of art.  Each roll is a masterpiece in itself and the signature Japango Roll is an attraction not to be missed.    The menu is plentiful so each visit is a new adventure into the depths and cuisine of the sea.  Butterfish nigri is a must-try as well - buttery-rich and flavoured with fresh garlic.  I have worked up the courage and trust in the chef to order Omakase - the chef's special.  I am certain I will not be disappointed.     Unlike the ocean, Japango seating is intimate and limited, so be sure to make a reservation, especially in larger groups. Take-out is also an option.  There's no need to travel across the world for fresh sushi - Japan-go's to Toronto."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi spots in Toronto hands down. The quality and arrangement of the fish is outstanding! Only downside to this place is the small size, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is really small so if you are planning to go on a Friday or weekend, I'd recommend making a reservation. However, the food is great. I'm not a big sushi fanatic and usually only eat California roll. The California roll & Dynamite roll & Dragon roll was amazing, so fresh and flavourful!!! Would recommend."}
{"text":"Best moderate priced sushi in Toronto. If your willing to spend $300 on sushi there are other places to go.    If you want to eat and drink a hearty amount of Sushi/sake/japanese beer for under $80-100 this is the best place.    Reservations needed at peak times.  Very small authentic feeling restaurant.   Japango Roll a must if you like maki.    Sashimi amazing quality.   Service efficient and friendly.   If you really hate small crowded restaurants you MAY want to avoid it - although I think the food is worth it.  Probably not the best place to bring large groups unless theres some planning involved.  Again - reservations recommended.   Although at off times it can be easy to get in.    A Toronto Essential Restaurant"}
{"text":"I got a takeout for their bento box. Portions are very small for the price. Paid $12 but it wasn't filling at all. Was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start:  It is a small cozy restaurant with occasion flies presented around the fishes. I would not surprise to see them if I am not in a Japanese restaurant.  Have waited for more than ten minutes and we had to raise our hand to notify the wait or and waitress that we were ready to order.  We wanted to order the tasting menu, but was only told that it has to be booked a day in advance. So we settled for the $50 sashimi and sushi combo. The sashimi were nice, however my friend and I have observed the senior waiter let our sushi dish sitting on the top of counter for more than five minutes until there was no other dishes on the counter even they were brought out later than the our sushi dish. Why this is a big deal? Any sushi chef will enforce you to eat the sushi just made within a minute or two once it was made. This was quite disappointed and we are unsure the reason why the waiter made such decision.   For the price we paid for the meal, around 300 Canadian dollars, we would better off with other upscale Japanese cuisine in the town."}
{"text":"While the space is small it's so intimate and fun. Get there early or better yet make a reservation since there are only 16 seats. So Worth it though !  The sashimi is fresh and delicious. I always start with fresh fish with no soy or wasabi. I want to taste the ocean not degraded oils and fats and it was superb here. Fresh flavor full of minerals and taste. I especially love the Escolar or butterfish. OMG!  So yummy! I look for sushi places that have this fish. Their rendition was with a slight char from a butane torch. Perfect!  And try the Japango roll. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I am giving a nasty one star because I am very disappointed they served us sea urchin that went bad, really bad. My friend and I both ordered sashimi dinner. I love sea urchin so I was pleasantly surprised to see them in the combo.  I saved the sea urchin until the very end. I saw that my friend didn't touch hers so I was gonna ask if I can eat hers too until she told me that the sea urchin wasn't fresh. I wasn't gonna give up on my uni like that, so I put one in my mouth.   Ugh...how I regret that!! I am sorry, but it literally tasted like poop. I picked up every piece on sea urchin and they all smelled like urine.   For a sushi restaurant to serve unfresh fish, I think this is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"We walked in this restaurant today and the waitress told us to wait for 15 mins to be seated. Ar least 10 mins after, one of the servers told us \"oh sorry we cant take u a seat because it's really full, would u like to try another restaurant which is running by japango too?. I refused him because he told us that we need to make another reservation. At the end, we went to jabistro, never going to japango ever again! I know we did not make reservation at the first place, but the server should have told us earlier."}
{"text":"Incredibly small so make sure you call before you visit.  This place is pretty legit. it is fairly authentic (way more authentic than most sushi places). Fish was all very fresh. we had the salmon skin maki (3/5) japango roll (4/5) and  dynamite roll (4/5), edamame (3.5/5) and gyoza (3/5). Was very reasonably priced for the quality and the service was pretty good although not overly attentive for such a small place. Either way, one of the best sushi joints in Toronto and the best value for money"}
{"text":"I went here last night with three other friends for a quick dinner. I was absolutely shocked by the size of the place - it has to be no bigger than a subway car. I am a regular at the location on Queen East in the Beaches, which is much much larger.  I made a reservation but had to wait an extra 10 minutes for them to set up the table. The worst part was that our table was right next to the door and let cold air in every time someone came in.  The staff was attentive and the sushi tasted great. However, I would not go back due to the small, claustrophobic environment and the high prices."}
{"text":"I went there with my friend and my friend was outside paying parking while the middle-aged guy who claimed himself the owner saying i wouldn't  be seated until both of us were here. I told him my friend was just outside paying parking and would be here in a sec... and he started giving out the tables to the next two pairs of ppl who were waiting behind me... I told him that was not fair at all cuz we were here first...he said that is the rule and if i don't like it go away!! When I was still standing there talking to my friend he said he was not serving us today and we wouldn't get a table... he even told my friend to take me out of his restaurant... This guy seems doesn't know how to properly treat or talk to the customers. There is really no respect...I came to this place since 2014, their service and food were good...  I'm not quite sure if there is a change of ownership whatsoever the service is becoming ridiculous... I will never come back to this place again"}
{"text":"I am so greatful to have found this place.  It has been our go-to place for sushi for years.  Although this restaurant is small (okay very small), its food is delicious.  Having been to Japan a couple of times, I would say that this sushi is one of the best I've had in Toronto.  I can't bring myself to eat anywhere else in Toronto (other than Yuzu!).    Their fish is fresh and not sludgy.  Their Japango roll is very tasty (even though I'm not much of a roll person msyelf).  My husband loves their sashimi don (diced fish on rice) and orders it without fail (comes with a homemade hot sauce).    I've also had their omakase a few times and I'm always so full that I end up rolling myself out.  It's amazing to taste different Japanese dishes outside of the standard sushi/sashimi.  They do a delicious black cod as well as a yummy seafood soup that comes in a teapot that you pour into a little teacup to drink."}
{"text":"Food is great as always but we found the experience too rushed for our liking. The mains came out before the appetizers and we felt the servers rushing us through and hovering to snatch away the dishes even when we hadn't finished. Would not recommend if wanting a nice relaxing dinner. For the amount of money spent, would have wanted a more enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"This is one of my top japanese restaurants in downtown.   I am always satisfied after having a meal here. The ingredients are very fresh! The sashimi has a fresh sweet flavor.   Japango is a solid place for top quality sashimi in Toronto.  My favorite item is the japango roll. This roll is soo flavorful and the sashimi is soo soft.  However, this restaurant is really small and it gets really busy during lunch hours.There isn't much room inside to let customers wait, so sometimes I had to wait outdoors in the winter just to come here and eat. But I think the wait is worth it to get the japango roll I love."}
{"text":"3 out of 5! Maki has too much rice. Great for sashimi. Fish is fresh. Small place so call in advance for reservation!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Ubereats. Ate here many times and the delivery portion size was incredibly small...more than half the size smaller than a dine in order but for the same price. Check out the photo of the tuna and avocado...$16."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times also - the sashimi here is delicious. My friend especially loves the sea urchin and tuna. Downside, is that the space is really, really cramped and when there is a lot of people it feels uncomfortable. However, go when they are not as busy and they will serve you wonderfully."}
{"text":"This is such a happy surprise for me, a visitor from the US. The fish is very fresh, and presentation elegant. I ended up going there two days in a roll. I especially like their chirashi and otoro. Uni sushi is great too! The restaurant is small, so don't expect a lot of space where you can host a party of ten. Sometimes you have to share a table if you go there alone. But for authentic sushi and sashimi, this is THE place to go! They have daily special sushi/sashimi too, so you will never get bored eating the same thing. The price is very reasonable, and much cheaper than a similar restaurant in NYC or D.C."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through orderit.ca and I was totally unsatisfied. The food was pretty pricey, and then the restaurant forgot part of my order, so they had to come back and deliver the rest. All in all it took 2 1/2 hours from when I placed my order to receive the whole thing.   And when the last part arrived, the sushi pizza looked like it had been thrown at a wall and stepped on.   Food was pretty bland too considering it cost 130 bucks for two people and we weren't even full at then end of our meal.   Would not go here again. Most AYCE sushi is better than this and a way better bargain."}
{"text":"*Massive* disappointment.  I got there on a Friday night, and was able to get a seat without waiting. It smelled like cumin, which was interesting for a Japanese restaurant, so I was intrigued by what kind of cuisine I'd encounter. It was a good start.  We got the avocado and tuna tartare as an appetizer. So, a good tartar should have excellent balance and mouthfeel for each bite. A good tartar, this was not. There were giant chunks of avocado and tuna. Sure, both were fresh, but that doesn't make it really noteworthy. It felt like they just pulled these ingredients out of the same pile they use for sushi rolls, with no extra care about the fact that it's a damn tartare, not \"random fresh ingredients\".  I got the chirashi. The rice was just sad. SAD. Chirashi rice should be lightly flavoured in such a way as to complement the sashimi, but their rice was just ... subpar. Very little flavor, and had an unremarkable texture. It should pair well with the fish, but I felt it was there because it was in the list of ingredients needed for chirashi, and not there because it added anything to the dish. The tuna they used here was a little too fishy and not so fresh. The other sashimi (salmon especially) were fresh, but there was no proper ornamentation in the presentation of the chirashi, and nothing unique about it. No real attempts at making the flavors really sing. The dish was missing something, something to make the dish pop. It just fell flat.  My friend got the chef's choice sashimi. She was displeased and unimpressed.  Service was prompt, but they didn't ask us if we wanted dessert (we certainly didn't).  I have no reason to go there again. You'll find equally fresh sashimi and better chirashi at Yuzu, though the last time I had it, it wasn't so special, but still better than this. If I crave a roll, I'll wait it out at Mi-Ne..."}
{"text":"Always make reservation for this restaurant. Staff is friendly and food is excellent but price is a bit steep"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant 4 times already. The dish - chirashi  is excellent, excellent, excellent!!!  2 Thumbs up!  It has an authentic Japanese feel as the shop is small ( same as most of the restaurant in Japan!).  Since I have not tried all different food, I can only give a 4 star."}
{"text":"Sweet and cozy. The chefs choice of sushi and sashimi came with horseradish. Fist time tried self-grind wasabi, gourmet!"}
{"text":"Found this great restaurant through Yelp. Pleasantly surprised at the quality since it was downtown in such a busy area. Its a small space, and everyone is really nice there. The sushi was really fresh and not only that, the sushi rice was a good amount of stickiness and moisture and flavour. The proportion of fish to rice was perfect. Not too much rice that it just overwhelms the fish and just a good amount. The sushi chef asked us how everything was as we were about to leave. They noticed that we recognized their good quality food :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi joints....I love their spicy salmon rolls.  Owners are super friendly and staff is always so considerate.   Only draw back is the place is really tiny so be sure to get there before the lunch rush otherwise you will not find seating."}
{"text":"It is NOT real sushi. Their rice was uncomfortably warm and uncooked. Fish was also strangely unfrozen. I doubt if they even know how to make sushi or Sashimi with sanitary knowledge. If you are Japanese or used to live in Japan and know real sushi, I'm quite sure you won't be satisfied with this restaurant. However, I recommend you if you like Chinese made Sushi, for example Sushi on Bloor in Annex."}
{"text":"Great food but terrible service. The bad service definitely trumped everything else. The waiter was very selective where the third person sits at a four-seater table. Worst of all, he would walk away to take order from another table in the middle of taking orders from us.   I still recommend people to eat there because the food was great, but you can definitely save on the tips! =) The waiter was very commending so we didn't feel like it was a proper restaurant. The table next to us even asked \"Did he just walk away while taking orders? That's too funny.\" For sure, it was hilarious actually.   Seems like this restaurant hasn't won any stars or reviews in the recent years. =)"}
{"text":"Legitimate - Toronto lacks proper sushi joints but Japango delivers. We focused on the daily specialities and enjoyed the blue fin tuna the most. Small and quaint, definitely proper Japanese style. Recommended."}
{"text":"Atrocious service! Avoid this place! We arrived at 6:02 for our 6:00 reservation, and were promptly told by the host (the owner, I surmise) that our reservation was cancelled and our table was given away because we were late. This was a bizarre claim because it didn't appear that any table had recently been seated. I then wondered if he had double booked, and was giving us the short shrift to cover their booking mistake, as I noticed that there was one vacant table remaining. I pointed to the empty table and said that we'll gladly take it. He curtly replied that it was already reserved. When I asked if the reservation for that table was also for 6:00, he said yes, and that the party would also lose their table for being late. He then condescendingly lectured us that it's best if we show up on time, and that being just 1 minute late would justify cancelling the reservation.  As though eager to get rid of us, he then impatiently motioned us toward the door and told us we'd have to wait outside for a table to become available. Disappointed, we made our way outside to wait for a table. At 6:08, the other late party arrived and was promptly seated (without being lectured). So much for being on time! We gave up and went elsewhere.  I thought maybe this was a one-off experience, but after reading some of the other reviews noting the questionable reservation policy and rude service, I think it is par for the course at this restaurant. At any rate, I'll gladly spend my money elsewhere, and I would urge anyone who values courteous service for their hard-earned money to do the same!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what happened to this place. I've been here a few times in a span of 5 years. My last visit was last Sat, and their fish are not the quality they used to be. Their tuna was bland and not thawed out. The only fish that had the natural fish taste was the mackerel.   I've been to Yuzu and their fish taste better. Almost everything is equal in price. They're owned by the same people so I don't understand why there's a difference in quality.  If you are Korean and speak Korean to the male waiter/manager, he'll give you free stuff. I saw the table beside us got free \"test\" clam soup as my friend translated their conversation to me afterwards.   I would recommand Zen if you're in Scarborough or want to take the trip there. ND Sushi & Grill for special rolls. Or just walk down a couple blocks to Yuzu instead."}
{"text":"Great lunch experience! We went right before peak lunch hour on a weekday, which was helpful.   Ordered the sashimi lunch box, which came with miso soup, rice, 10 pc sashimi, green salad and 2 tiny salads (one green bean, the other pickled veggies).    It was the perfect size lunch. Fish was extremely fresh (melt-in-your-mouth!!) and of high quality.  Beautiful presentation in the bento box.  Service was very quick - we had our food in less than 10 minutes after ordering.  If you want to have an excellent sushi lunch downtown in well under an hour, this should be your next stop! I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Second time there. Perfect as usual. Ordered sushi one and Ikura. The fish are super fresh. And Ikura is worth dying for. This little place is kind of expensive for a student budget, but I am willing to go for its high quality and half full stomach without the sick feeling you get from a cheap sushi place."}
{"text":"Over rated sushi restaurant. You can have much fresher sushi and authentic Japanese food at Japanese-owned restaurants just outside the downtown core for much less. Service was curt and slow, something you wouldn't expect from a Japanese restaurant run by Japanese. Would not come back here again."}
{"text":"Still my hands down favourite place for sushi in Toronto.  Atmosphere is cool, it's tiny and cozy, there's 20 seats total, so if you don't plan ahead, you'll probably need to wait, depending on when you show up.  Quality of the fish is quite good, and highly consistent.  It's the place that turned me on to sushi, and now I have a bit of a problem... Really love the rolls, when I go that way, or the sashimi, when I go the other!  Omakase, if you can plan a day in advance (and you're feeling spendy) is a great idea.  On my list of things to do again!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the restaurant itself is very small. Definitely would not recommend if you're the slightest bit claustrophobic. I came with my three other friends and we each got a bento. We also ordered the japango sushi roll and the dynamite roll to share. I had finished my bento and was eating the sushi. I set my chopstick down for just a few seconds and the waiter quickly removed my box and chopsticks but I was not done eating yet.... they did this again with another waiter too. I felt super rushed and I understand that it's all about turnover but let me finish my meal. Also, they had overcharged us with an item that we didn't even order. Luckily one of my friends noticed it or else we would've paid extra!!   Most likely not coming back."}
{"text":"probably the best sushi i've had in Toronto. highly recommended."}
{"text":"I like the place, it was small and busy which meant your order was taken in a reasonable amount of time and you were served quickly enough.  The calamari was simple but tasty. Not the greatest and this was true of the gyoza too. Good, but not great.  The maki was well done and the price wasn't too bad either. California roll and salmon skin were delicious."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations from all that I have read about this restaurant. When we first arrived, we were greeted inside of a tiny room that seated about 15 people, a good sign of authenticity within this bustling urban city. We decided to go with the sashimi platter, Japango roll, as well as a salmon teriyaki bento box. I believe that they made their own teriyaki sauce, but it seemed to be a bit too sweet for my taste. The Japango roll was a bit of a disappointment because it was a standard California roll topped with sashimi. However, I enjoyed the sashimi, which was served fresh, although a few pieces were a bit too firm. Overall, I would say skip the bento and go with the sashimi and a roll."}
{"text":"Bought take out today.  The food tasted very fresh and my husband and I enjoyed it very much.  We got 6 California roll with assorted sushi and sashimi.  Came with 2 miso soup and rice.  Bill was $40.  A little bit on pricy side but again you are paying for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Five-stars based on food ONLY but because the food is as great as it is I can overlook the small limited seating elbowing my neighbour and smelling their food atmosphere.  A friend recommended this place as a must try sushi in TO and I am so glad he did!   So if you haven't guessed yet it's not fancy by any means which means they have to work really hard and compensate with the food and that they do. We didn't make reservations - big NO NO but were lucky enough to find a table for two stuck to the window and the poor husband could only fit half of himself on the small seat that was stuck against the window - he was quite unimpressed. Our neighbours who were a finger length away from us were regulars there and assured us the painful seating arrangement is well worth it - \"trust me\" they said, very convincingly.   And here's where the blind faith comes in to play... As per their recommendations we ordered\" 1. BC Tuna - the best piece of fish I have ever had in my life. It was slightly pricey but OMG why have I never had this before?  2. Chicken udon noodles - delic! I usually don't order hot meals at sushi places - doesn't quite make sense to me to do so but les neighbours here were so terribly insistent that I felt very awkward not ordering so even though I kept thinking I'm paying for this meal not them and really you're not the boss of me - and despite the closeness and smell of your over powering deodorant - we've only just met.  I haven't been back again only because I'm a little hesitant to make my way there and not find a place to sit but I know, I really MUST. SOON."}
{"text":"Today, we had dinner at Japango since JW and I were still recovering from the cold we caught last week. Japanese food is always the way to go when you don't feel well and want something refreshing.  We started off with agedashi tofu. The crust of the tofu was too hard to be harmonized with the softness of the tofu. The shape of the bowl completely soaked the tofu into the sauce so the last two tofu was not even crispy anymore after we finished off the first two on top.  We then ordered some sushi  Saba is naturally not very fatty as it does not have a lot of fish oil in the meat. Therefore, this sushi was very refreshing and had a crisp texture. It was very different from normal sushi like salmon and tuna. The amount of green onion and ginger layered on top really helped to bring out the flavour while did not overpower the taste of the fish.  Last time when we visited Japango, they had an Aji(Horse Mackerel) dish that was served in two ways; most of the fish was served as sushi and then the rest of the fish including the fish head was fried.  The sushi was absolutely delicious and fresh and the presentation was very appealing. Although there was not a lot of meat left in the fried fish, the bone of the body of the fish was very soft and crispy after deep fried so we could eat the entire fish including the bone. It was the first time I realized that Aji could be served like this and became one of my go-to fish when going to authentic japanese restaurant. Unfortunately,  we did not come across this dish this time. We asked the owner and he said they actually serve this dish a few times a week. I think we will call next time to see whether they have it before we go!   Overall, the Hotate was not satisfying. We could not taste the freshness of the scallop. The fact that it was seared did not help to elevate the taste and richness in the fish oil like it does in most fishes (i.e. salmon). Instead, it gave it a hint of burnt taste which we suspected was one of the factors that took away/covered up the freshness of the scallop. It also increased the temperature and slightly changed the texture of the scallop so it became firmer than raw scallop. It felt like a tasteless, burnt scallop that was uncooked in a pasta. I think we enjoy raw scallop on its own much better.  The hamachi itself was rather refreshing like Aji but had more fattiness in the fish. However, the sushi I had had too much too green onion and ginger on it that it outcompeted the natural taste of the fish. Nevertheless, it was phenomenal.   Last summer, JW and I visited Japan and we had the most amazing Anago sushi ever. Compared to Unagi which is the freshwater eel commonly found in all Japanese restaurants, Anago is naturally very rich in flavour and has a firmer texture. It is always served warm and does not require as much sauce to create its flavour like Unagi because the taste of Anago itself is very delicious. Whenever I see Anago on the menu in Toronto, I will always order it because of the experience we had in Japan. So far, the one I had at Taro Sushi was, even not in par with one we had Japan, quite satisfying.  The one I had in Japango was quite disappointing. They used too much sauce and covered up all the flavours it should have in Anago. The texture was just...not Anago. Overall, it totally tasted just like Unagi.  We also ordered their signature Japango roll. Needless to say its DELICIOUS. The California roll had seared Salmon and scallop layered on top, drizzled with Japango's secrete sauce and a little bit of spicy oil. Compared to the spicy rainbow roll from ND Sushi, Japango roll was definitely not as spicy and easy in the mouth. The secrete sauce was sweet and tasted a little like Teriyaki sauce and went very well with the fish oil that came out from the salmon after seared. With a hint of spiciness, the sauce was not as overwhelmed as it would be on its own. If we can only recommend one dish from Japango, it will definitely be the Japango Roll.  We finished off the meal with Sashimi Don. This highly resembled the spicy sashimi bibim from ND sushi. We are not saying that this copies that but they just taste and look pretty simliar. Unlike the ND sushi one, the greens was replaced by cucumbers but we prefer having greens because of the harmonizing and refreshing texture of the greens, rice and sashimi. However, I believe that by not having greens, the sashimi don became an entree on its own instead of a salad or appetizer. Overall, the sauce tasted like bibimbap sauce yet sweeter and went pretty well with the freshness of the fish and the rice. The portion was huge. It was definitely more filling and heavy than the one from ND which was seen more like an appetizer.  conclusion:   roasted!   We enjoyed it!   visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/01/28/japango-sushi-noodle-restaurant/  for awesome pictures about the sushi i mentioned :)"}
{"text":"I am just crazy about good quality small sushi restaurants and this one fits the bill.  I found this one on a recent trip to Toronto and I will be finding a reason t come back.  We went around 12:30 on Saturday and stayed for a good hour, the entire time the place was packed.  There is clearly a regular client base that comes back on a regular basis, which is the second sign of a great sushi joint.  The sushi was just top notch.  We also had some great soba noodle with tempura.  Everything was just perfect.  If you get a chance to go here you should.  They do take reservations and I suggest you do that.  There location only holds about maybe 20 people tops so this is the best way to make sure you get a table."}
{"text":"Uni sashimi is my favorite but not fresh at all here. Arrived at 4:30, plenty of seats but got shoved to the corner because we were only two people. When we left, there were still seats. A Korean middle aged male waiter was very rude. Will not return again. After all it's not even a Japanese run restaurant, it's Korean owned. Food and service certainly do not deserve all the high points"}
{"text":"In Toronto for a conference - looked up Japango here because I wanted some good sushi . . . Bingo! Japango is awesome, authentic & intimate, little gem of a sushi bar!  I ordered straight-ahead sashimi, nigiri & temaki; and washed it down with lots of  Asahi - delicious!"}
{"text":"What can I say. When a restaurant gets famous it can lose it's humbleness. They are snobbish towards customers who don't order much and serves you lower quality sashimi when your order is not big in $$$. That's just not classy. The staff is horrifying pushy and rude. If you are looking for a nice Friday night dinner to chill with friends. Don't go. This place is for work lunch and takeout. They steal your dishes as soon as you had your last bite and ask you to pay in no time. Funny enough, this time they asked the three of us to squeeze into a two people table the moment we paid the bill. Note the space is Japanese size. When I said we don't plan to leave yet and we have only been here for 30 min which is under your 1 hr seating limit, the waiter said you only get two seats because the other girl didn't order any food. First of all my friend tried to order a food item on the menu but the restaurant didn't have it. Secondly how is that a legit reason anyways!! Then I wonder all the times I spend 50 bucks on my dinner shouldn't I be give two an extra seat?? The conversation just stopped there the waiter just left us and gave away our seat. when we left, no one greeted us. This one will never make the cut to a quality restaurant and only a money making machine without soul."}
{"text":"I actually took the time to read what others have said about Japango before writing this review because I feel this strange guilt about not liking this restaurant.  I must admit before we go any further that I may be a bit of a sushi-snob having grown up in Japan and Vancouver... it's common knowledge that both places are spoiled with good sushi. It is always really important to me to find out the authenticity of the sushi restaurants before I go and since Japango was recommended to me as authentic and good, I had relatively high expectations. BOO fricking URNS.  The layout is absolutely horrendous. I showed up mid-afternoon (thereby missing the decent lunch prices - another boo urns) so there was only one other party of 2 in the restaurant. Thus, my question: WHY were we still shoved to the tiny table by the window, which, in the process of squeezing in, gave me several bruises and cramps in my back and legs? Unhappy camper already. To make the sitch worse, there was a really annoying fly that wouldn't go away.   As I mentioned, we missed the lunch prices which really sucked because dinner prices were kind of ridiculous. Since we were there on a whim and did not intend on a fancy meal, we just ordered four different rolls. They were OKAY at best. The spice that they used for the spicy rolls were pretty spicy - I like spice so I wasn't bothered, but those spice babies might want to watch out. I don't think that the spice complemented the rolls though, which is really unfortunate because by this point the restaurant has already lost enough points with me. The rolls were cut into 8 per, which is a decent portion size I guess... but considering this was our \"simple lunch in a pinch\" it really should not have cost us over $30 for such an unmemorable meal.  And final comment on the authenticity - perhaps other Yelpers can help me clarify: is it really authentic? Because I tried speaking Japanese to the waitress and I don't think she was. The chefs were definitely NOT Japanese. So, HUGE BOO URNS for failing on the main reason I was lured there. I probably wouldn't go back... I'll just fly to Japan the next time I crave \"authentic\" sushi, no big.  atmosphere - 1/5 service - 3/5 food - 2/5 price - 2/5"}
{"text":"I usually go there for the chirashi. Pretty busy and crowded since it's a small place. Good for lunch if you don't mind the wait. The sashimi in the chirashi changes depending on the availability."}
{"text":"Located near the eaton center and Ryerson University, come dinner time this place is always booked.  Surprisingly, this small cramped space  serves up some of the best tasting sushi I ever had.  The fish is very fresh and the spicy sauce (which is actually spicy) used in their rolls are dynamite.  The service is also fast and friendly.  Hell, if you become one of their most prized customers you'll earn your own pair of chopsticks that hang behind the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Decent sushi with generous portion sizes and perhaps a little heavy on the rice/fish ratio. Really they deserve 3 stars except the service for takeout brings it down ... We usually call an order ahead before the lunch hour and give them plenty of time to prepare it, but sometimes end up waiting and waiting in a crowd, not acknowledged at all, while others are served in seemingly no order. The poor staff seems frantic!"}
{"text":"dont be late for your reservation; if youre not there on the dot, they will give your table away and passively aggressively tell you to squeeze in their tiny entrance with your group of 3 and 3 other people.  but the food is really good."}
{"text":"Good service.  Food was as expected, no better, no worse than other sushi places I've been to.  Very small dining area."}
{"text":"The uni and seared fish are so good! I had the deluxe sushi dinner, which includes miso soup, small salad, 12 nigiri and a tempura roll for $30. It's slightly pricier than the 2 dollar signs suggest, but the fish was super fresh and delicious so it was well worth it! I love that they served a good variety of fish, and the presentation was beautiful. I also received an interesting free desert: a mint hand roll.  The service was friendly, though I got my bill before I asked for it, which makes sense considering how tiny the place is. I arrived around 5pm on a Tuesday, so I didn't have to wait, but I'm guessing any later the place would be packed. I really like the atmosphere. It's a small and quaint space, and you can watch the chefs as they speedily prepare your sushi. I'll definitely be back to try their specialty rolls and otoro!"}
{"text":"Worst service experienced in a Japanese resturant. Food is okay however staff/waiter's service was tremendously poor. Staff should be probably trained for the manner and service etiquette needed in a Japanese restaurant. Immediately handed out the bill right after finishing the last dish and before I requested. Minimum a meal per person. Would never return or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Cozy place! But better make reservation before head to this place. My friend and I both ordered the sashimi don, the sashimi tastes really fresh, however we didn't like the taste."}
{"text":"They definitely rush you through your meal, and you might be out in less than an hour.  They brought us our bill without us asking for it, and my dining companion had intended to order dessert.  The sushi is very good, but not outstanding.  When we went, one person was serving and bussing all of the tables, so it wasn't easy to get his attention so service could be a little inattentive (and yet they still get you out the door PDQ).   The decor/ambience is authentically japanese which is pretty cool.    I'd say it's worth trying but perhaps not worth repeating."}
{"text":"This was an excellent japanese restaurant and was definitely worth the 2-hr wait in the freezing (literally below 20F) cold when I visited back in December and made me love Toronto even more. My fault for not reserving in advance on a busy night.   The salmon was pleasantly fresh and delicately prepared. I could taste the freshness every single layer and the heart and expertise the chef put into preparing this. The udon (forgot which one) was cooked in a light yet flavorful broth as well. The sushi rolls were also above average; morever, the owner gave us free black seasame ice cream and apologized for the wait - awesome! The people were also very nice! Prices were a bit on the higher side and the bill came out to be around $140 for 3, but the free ice cream (I think we got an extra roll as well) were worth it; both my stomach and I were happy."}
{"text":"This has been my first visit in Toronto and I was looking on Yelp to find a recommended sushi restaurant. There are so many sushi places to pick from in Toronto. We decided to go with Japango and had lunch there.   First of all- the atmosphere is charming. It is such a small and cute little restaurant. It is very simple but very unique at the same time. If you are hoping to have a more private experience this may not be the place to pick- you will likely be sitting next to other people as the seating is fairly packed. However, this did not bother us at all- I'm just giving a heads up.  The service was wonderful! We were a little late for the lunch special but the server gave us the lunch specials anyways- which we really appreciated.  The food was served very timely and the presentation was wonderful. The fish was extremely fresh and delicious. I had a glass of white sushi wine from Niagara - which I highly recommend.  The wine was excellent and complemented the seafood nicely.   As far as price range goes- their pricing is average in comparison to most sushi restaurants. I will say if you can make the lunch hours you'll get a much better value. However, the whole experience is truly worth it - so I highly recommend going.  I will remember Japango and hopefully the next time I am in Toronto I will go again."}
{"text":"We have to post this review because something used to prepare the sushi was bad ... We finished our dinner 2 hours ago and we are both sick.  The taste of the fish was good so most likely the problem was the nori because we vomited it ... First time in my life that it happens to me.   The service was really good but the end of the party was too bad ..."}
{"text":"Fresh sashimi that has that mouthfeel you're looking for in the good stuff, but for the price, I'd rather go to Yuzu No Hana for their superior atmosphere and presentation.   I didn't find the oil they use on the fish here terribly appealing, nor do I find that it detracts. The oyster shooter with uni and quail egg was okay - again, fresh. The miso soup was extremely salty, overpowering any of the other flavours normally found in that soup. I abandoned it after a couple of sips. I don't usually like \"special\" rolls but I will say that the Japango roll, topped with seared fish and hot and spicy sauces, was very good. Wouldn't come back for it, though.   Service is efficient -- almost too efficient because they clearly wanted us out of there ASAP. Again, it's very small.   Bottom line: not bad if you're stuck in the area, but there's much better for the price not too far away."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Japango and it was just as good as the first time.  The first time was take-out and the second time I actually sat down in the restaurant.    The place is small, when we arrived there just happen to be a few seats available.  I got the Chirashi and I loved the rice and the sashimi.  Every bite of the rice was flavourful.  Each piece of the sashimi on top of the rice was well prepared.  The dish came with a salad and a soup, but I wasn't as much as a fan of this.    There is a lot of choice on the menu and I'll have to try other rolls another time.  Price of the menu is slightly higher than other sushi places I've been to in Toronto, but this is worth the extra few bucks!"}
{"text":"I really like the vibe of this place.  I like the fact that it's tiny, intimate and off the main drag of the street. You could blink and miss it.  I swear it'll seat 15 people, tops.  But if you go into the restaurant to order takeout, or to get a seat, and look behind the bar, you'll see oodles of signed celebrity photos all praising the sushi.  I sincerely agree with the praise. I have never had a bad meal from this place."}
{"text":"This place is tiny! If you want a romantic dinner,  this  is not the place for it. But I like this place. It's quaint.   I wasn't too crazy about the oyster special. It's a bit too alcohol-y for me. Tuna belly sashimi special is weak too.  The rest of the meal (yakitori, seaweed salad, seared scallop, salmon sashimi) was pretty good. Japango roll is very yummy.   Great Service.Very friendly staffs."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to Japango. The first time I went, I was blown away by the delicious seasoned sushi rice and the fresh fish on the chirashi sushi. The service was quick and attentive.  This time, the food also did not disappoint, but the service was terrible. I had made a reservation for lunch, and arrived several minutes early to a half-empty restaurant. Rather than seating me until my dining partner arrived, they asked whether I could come back (so that perhaps they could fill the table that I had already reserved?).  The waiter who served us was extremely rude. My dining partner asked about the deluxe bento and was asking what sushi came with the bento, and asked whether any unagi would be included. The waiter scoffed and replied, \"Of course not, we never put unagi in our combos!\" - as if it were obvious that's what \"chef's selection\" meant. My dining partner was disgruntled for the rest of the meal. As I was the one who paid, the same waiter asked me how much I would like put on my card, as if to try and gauge how well I would tip.  All in all, the service ruined what was otherwise a perfectly good lunch. If I ever go back, I'm sticking with takeout."}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh but very basic. Staff not friendly at all. Fake crab in the California rolls... Really just generic sushi. Not sure why all the rave reviews bit am guessing that most have not tried really good sushi."}
{"text":"This tiny shack of a restaurant is right off Elizabeth St and Dundas.   It's narrow. One side of the restaurant is lined with some wobbly dark brown wooden tables for two's and the other side a sushi counter.. where I saw this hunk of raw tuna  Also saw some signed photos of celebrities on the wall and the small bathroom at the back which was clean. Points for that.   So we were there for dinner at 5 and surprisingly the restaurant was empty! Private dining experience for us. Woohoo!  1. Ordered a roll combo: which includes a California roll, dynamite (shrimp tempura) roll, and salmon roll.   2. I wanted something warm to go with the rolls, so we decided on the chicken teriyaki (dark meat version) served with a bowl of rice.   My thoughts on the food -   The roll combo - not too impressed, the salmon roll - consisted of tiny pieces of salmon. Shrimp tempura was OK  at least it was warm so I know it was made to order. California roll was made right.  The highlight though, was the chicken teriyaki. Yes it was something special. Probably one of the best I've had in the city in fact.  The chicken was slightly crisp on the outside and the sauce was very light and flavourful, it was garnished with toasted sesame seeds and accented with a slice of cherry tomato and green. Served together with a side bowl of rice. I'd come back for this dish again and again.    So check out Japango for the teriyaki they do this well!!"}
{"text":"The Gem is downtown Toronto, hidden on Elizabeth ave just south of dundas street. Tables for about 20 people only. Very nice!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a non-ayce sushi place close to the Eaton centre and came across this place on Yelp. When we first walked in we were not expecting it to be so small! Probably only fits ~15-20 people. We wanted to order the bento boxes but unfortunately only available on weekdays. I ended up getting a sashmi dish which was plated so nicely. Sashmi were a good size and came with a side of rice and miso soup. My friend got dynamite and crunch (?) roll which was also plated nicely and she enjoyed it. My bf got a sushi dish which came with 4-5 different kinds of nigiri which also tasted amazing. Overall, everything tasted very fresh! K"}
{"text":"Lovely Japanese food. I went over lunch and  they had gluten free soy sauce on hand (!) which instantly made a good impression but the attentive staff, even over a very busy lunch period, and excellent rolls made this a great experience. The green tea was forthcoming and also much nicer than most place (I drink a lot of green tea). Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is tiny, but amazing! The service is insanely quick. I'll suggest the Tuna and Avocado Tartar and the Crunchy Spicy Salmon roll (as well as the Tuna one).   If you are looking for more space to spread out and if you don't like hearing side conversations, then you should probably go somewhere else. If you want good sushi, go to Japango."}
{"text":"I am a girl from Tokyo, Japan. and This is the only place in Toronto I think is as fresh and great as real sushi in Tokyo! I wish the space was little bigger...  but every time I went there, I had great experiences. they always gave me free fresh stuff on the house! highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tiny but amazing place in dt. Still crowded around 2 pm on a weekday. Ordered Sashimi Lunch Combo, very fresh & delicious sashimi, all the sides were perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"We just finished the MOST disappointing meal and are anticipating food poisoning. Food was delivered via UberEats. Food was not packed with care, it looks cheap. It had leaked all over the napkins. The sashimi was squished and stacked together. The sushi was unidentifiable and without flavour. I have ordered before and was happy, but am now removing it from my list of go-tos.   We paid way too much, waited way too long, and enjoyed it far too little to give this another try."}
{"text":"For Authentic Japanese Cuisine this is the place to go. Food is fantastic and atmosphere is great. A nice date night place to go."}
{"text":"Ordered the sashimi Bento from the lunch menu. It had four different types of fish and some sides. The fish were very fresh and for under $20 with tax and tip, it's a very good place to get your sushi fix."}
{"text":"Never go run with japango when you feel like having fresh sashimi! However place is a bit small and gets quiet noisy ;-)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Japango for a number of years. Their sashimi and sushi is one of the freshest in the city. Price is very affordable. I would suggust asking their chefs what is the daily specials - the import the freshest ingredients by season, so you are in for a treat, if you try their specials menu.   Seating unfortunately, is very cramped. It is charming, but not so much when you are a tall individual or a group of friends looking to get a table. On a few occasions, service has been a bit rude I have to say. But given the quality of the food, I still return"}
{"text":"Yes it is small, cramped, and overpriced, but boy it is GOOD. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and while I was skeptical at first, I was def blown away by the food quality. So far the best sushi I've had in Toronto. Fresh, a good fish/rice ratio, my boyfriend had the salmon teriyaki and it was the best I've ever had. I give it 3 stars for the claustrophobic environment and prices, but 5 for food. We'll definitely order in next time (hopefully it'll arrive as fresh)."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time. Space is very limited so we try to get here earlier to avoid the lunch rush. Food is always fresh and the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"The sushi was fine but it's super cramped quarters and they seem to put a lot of sugar in things. It's good if you like eavesdropping..  Service was reasonably good but slow, they made one mistake and stopped refilling my tea after a bit.. seems it would be good for takeout."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The male server was extremely rude. When I first entered the restaurant and sat down the server demanded me to move seats because he could not serve the food. This was understandable, which I agreed upon since the place was extremely small. Afterward ordering and getting the food, I requested for more tea, which I did not receive until i asked him for the third time.   The male server slammed my tea that was refilled onto the table, which caused a huge mess. He did not apologize at all, but instead he gave more attitude. And to end with all the disappointment, they just handed the bill to my table without us asking.    The food is considered decent and a bit pricey. I ordered the supreme chirashi $28, which they charged $7 more than the normal chirashi. The only difference was the three extra pieces which they claim to be better when it really is not. The sashimi tasted watery.   I will never come back ever again. WIth the customer service that i received and the cost of the sushi, I believe that I can definitely find a better sushi place in downtown."}
{"text":"Japango was once my favorite sushi place but I won't go there anymore because of their terrible service.   I arrived about 15 mins before the reservation time, and my friend was late. The guy, seems to be the owner, asked me if I have reservation and i said yes it's 6:30. He replied \"oh it's not 6:30 yet\" with very wired attitude and asked me to stand outside to wait, even though they have couple chairs put near the door to let waiting customers to sit. And I asked again at 6:30, he still asked me to stand outside. Two years ago i did the same thing, the waiter not only provided me a seat in the restaurant, but also gave me a cup of water. I don't what makes this restaurant worse and worse."}
{"text":"Ordered same thing i did a year ago  when i loved this place - unaju, sake sushi & seared toro sushi. Wuality has definitely gone down. Sushi rice was hard, sashimi pieces were not fresh and lack taste. Unaju too much sauce. Not worth the money. Miyabi in Rhill has spoiled me."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi and sashimi I've ever had. Highly recommend the Japango Roll! Hot sake and edamame are great as well!"}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to Japango and for the most part, I was once again pleased with the meal. While the food is certainly more impressive than the layout and atmosphere of the restaurant, it was overall a good dinner experience.  Food (4.5/5)  My girlfriend and I went big and started the meal with the $20 tuna belly sashimi as we had been thinking about it since the last time we came. Unfortunately, we made the right the decision the first time when we passed on it as this was the weakest part of the meal. The sashimi was fatty (a plus) and not overly flavorful (a big disappointment) and was certainly not worth the $20 price tag.   Up next, we had miso soup, green salad, gyoza and edamame for our appetizers. Of the bunch, the green salad was the only one that missed the mark. It wasn't bad but it was nothing beyond what you typically receive in a sushi place on Bloor. The miso soup was well above average, with well-proportioned pieces of tofu in a clean broth. The gyoza was a nice contrast to the fish-heavy meal we were about to eat. The individual dumplings had a crispy exterior with good flavour. Finally, the edamame were cooked well and served hot (which is not always the case in Toronto).   For the main course, we each ordered the $40 sashimi and nigiri platters and were very pleased overall. While it is hard to remember all of the different types of fish and other seafood that came with the platter (there were tweleve overall), the highlights were definitely the white tuna (far superior to the tuna belly mentioned above) and three of the four types of sashimi on that platter (unfortunately, I can't recall their names).   Layout/Atmosphere (2.5/5) The layout is clearly a serious weak point for Japango. There are about tables crammed into a space that should contain six and as a result, you end up sitting a bit too close to your neighbours. There is not even space to put your coat and bag next to you on the bench without touching the person sitting nearby. Also, tall people beware. My girlfriend and I are both around 6 feet and because of how the table and chairs are constructed, you can barely put your feet under the table and must contort your body to fit into the space. Finally, every time the front door is opened during the winter, a cold breeze rushes through the tiny restaurant and it is not pleasant if this happens ten times during your meal.   As the food is great, I would obviously recommend trying this restaurant. However, because of the space constraints, you may want to consider takeout and/or dining in the summer."}
{"text":"I stayed in niagara on the lake, drove to Toronto for this restaurant for my special occasion dinner. Made a reservation @7pm, got seated right away. I felt lucky after while because I saw number of people got frustrated, walked away due to waiting issue.  This place is so small and packed. 20 people maximum most probably. We sat in the corner, space was super tight. Wasn't comfortable at all but it was somewhat very personal.  We got served hot tea to start. Ordered hot house sake, omakase and moriawase. Restaurant ran by Korean, I could hear some Korean languages at times in the sushi bar. Service was done by one staff. He was so busy, no time to answer customers' questions. But still there were many people kept coming in and ask same question. \" how long should we wait?\" \" I waited ...\" \"My reservation was ...\"  He had to serve the food, take the order, answer the phone. And this place is so small, there are nowhere to put one more staff to help serving.   Sushi and sashimi were all fresh and delicious, price was very reasonable also. Nikiri( sweet soy sauce for sushi) was complimenting sushi/sashimi. It wasn't salty, had some sweet taste in the end. All their sashimi/sushi were gliding in the mouth. They also brush a bit of sauce or sesame oil on top of fish depend on sashimi/sushi, it made a perfect harmony in my mouth.  When I go back to Toronto, I'll definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I have been to. We had the signature roll and it did not disappoint. We also tried the crunchy tuna and the dragon. The service was excellent and the sushi Chiefs were quick. A must try!"}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and surprisingly good. Not cheap. But worth the price for sure! The uni I had was extremely sweet and full of flavour. Will go back again. Remember to book the reservation since it's very tiny space."}
{"text":"Never had better sushi in Toronto. Thank you Japango!  Cheers,"}
{"text":"Overall good experience. Wanted to get Uni but they didn't have it, wanted to get sweet shrimp also didn't have it. Recommend their seared o-toro, taste just what I expected! The eel was ok. Japango roll seems like a must-get here, and it does taste great."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Japango Cuisine: Japanese Location: Dundas Square Address: 122 Elizabeth St Price Range: $15~25  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3  Extra information:  *Open for Lunch *Small seating area *Lunch specials *Known for fresh sashimi *Korean owned  Ok, so I know I am a little too harsh when it comes to Japanese food. But I can't just ignore the fact that I am originally from the westcoast and have been SPOILED with fresh, cheap, good quality sushi all my life. At least now I know for a fact that I shouldn't expect good cheap sushi in Toronto, my standards for Japanese sushi joints have been reset, Toronto style.  Japango is a Korean run sushi restaurant hidden away in a quiet corner of Elizabeth Street. I read up couple reviews and everyone was raving about their fresh sashimi and sushi, so why not give it a try? Restaurant is pretty small with seating for 15 people MAX. Other than the fact that the chairs were uncomfortables, I found it be quite cozy seated in the corner. Japango received many 'awards' and 'compliments' from various magazines/websites/papers such as Toronto Star, Zagat and Now Magazine.  Ordered: SASHIMI BENTO - 2/5  *4 types of sashimi, rice, salad and a sidedish for $13.00 *4 sections to bento box consisting of sashimi, veggies, rice and sald *There are 4 types of basic sashimi (typical salmon and tuna), they are fresh very tiny in terms of size *I found the Cooked Zucchini(4 pieces) to be really out of place in this box, I felt like it was just a way for them to fill up one of the sections *They give you lots and lots of plain rice.WHY? I have no idea! It wasn't even sushi rice (vinegar, salt and sugar) and I had nothing to eat it with. I felt like they were trying to fill me up with rice *Again, lots of boring salad with typical japanese salad dressing *Yes, sashimi was fresh but they are just so tiny there is nothing to chew. *There is not much to eat and this is not worth $13, I rather just get sashimi separately  Ordered: SUSHI #2 COMBO - 3/5  *8 pieces of nigiri sushi and a California roll for $14.00 *4 different types of fish, 2 pieces each *Nigiri was all decent, fresh but nothing special *California roll was super dry (Y U NO MAKE YUMMY ROLLS IN TO!?) *I wasn't full or satisfied after this combo, but if I was craving decent quality nigiri, I would get this again  Throughout the meal, I asked for more ginger and they got a small side of it for me. But when it arrived, I saw there were bits of wasabi on their ginger. This could mean they re-use their ginger after serving it (ew)? I am not saying they do but when you see wasabi on ginger...it makes you wonder. Also, they put lemon in their ice water which is kind of nice. But when I first got it, there were no lemon slices in the cup and only the lemon pulps were visible and for a second I thought the water was dirty. So just keep that in mind when you ask for ice water. I was there when they just opened so there weren't that many people at the restaurant but overall they had good service. The waitresses were super attentive, friendly and helpful.  The bill came to $30.51 after tax before tip. Kind of expensive for lunch maybe?   Summary: Unless you are a tiny little asian girl, this place won't fill you up until you burn a hole in your wallet. It's not my favorite spot yet but I am willing to give it another try if I am craving nigiri sushi. Just make sure to stay away from sashimi bento box!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese sushi resto tucked away in a tiny storefront off of Dundas. They have a row of chopsticks reserved for the regulars that have their names on the wooden box. I think the quality depends on who's working that night.   I had amazing melt-in-your mouth sashimi the first time, the second time I had stomach issues from a raw quail egg cracked over a sushi roll, and the most recent time, I had a cool fresh sea urchin cracked open and served right there! That was the first and only time I've ever seen that at a sushi place.  The place fills up quickly and you'll pretty much always be squeezed next to other customers. I wouldn't go with more than 2 people. Great date spot too."}
{"text":"Japango roll soooo is good! Katsu don so so, cause the meat wasn't really good and little bit overpriced, everything else is good!"}
{"text":"If you like sushi, and you come to Toronto, you must try Japango.  If you try any rolls, ask for the Green River roll.  However, the chef's selection meal (needs to be ordered in advance), and the specials are terrific. The real gold here is the fish, just the fish. This is a terrific place to expand your palate and try something OTHER than salmon and tuna (though those are great as well).  You must try the seabream (both of them), tuna belly if its available, and trust your server to recommend a good suggestion of any other fish available.  A terrific and guaranteed to please place."}
{"text":"Food gets a solid 4/5.   Atmosphere is tight.  I was so close to the person on my left that they knocked my chopsticks off my table!  I don't know if it is possible to arrive as a group.  I think it is only for couples.   Service and food was so good that I would go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service from arrogant male staff member.   The food is very good. I've eaten here many times and have spent a lot of money here over the past years. Last time i visited there was absolutely terrible service from a male server with glasses, about 30-35 year old guy. Short black hair on side long on top. He was rude to my friend, forgot menu items we ordered which he most likely did purposely, would not let us sit in the seats we wanted. I don't put up with any BS so i didn't let him get away with it at all. And thats what he probably didn't like.   The funniest part was at the end of our meal around 10:00pm he asked for last call and we ordered a bottle of sake and his reply was \"ill decide if you have enough time and will let you know\". I reminded him that they close at 10:30 (advertised) and he replied \"im closing at 10:20\". He never brought us the $28 bottle of sake.   This guy is a joke he's like the \"big boss\" server at japango. Such an egomaniac.   The experience was so distasteful that i will never be back there. Its sad because the food is great and the chefs and other staff are friendly. I hope mgmt recognizes this and fires this guy, he is bad for business.   If anyone knows a restaurant which serves high quality sushi with better service pls let me know!"}
{"text":"Yelpers did not disappoint with this recommendation!  :)  My business colleague and I were staying a few blocks away, so decided to brave the chilly evening and walk down to Japango.  Very tiny restaurant (maybe 20 seats?) serving up very delicious Japanese food.  We were lucky that there was no wait and we got a table right away.  I got all sushi and was impressed by the freshness, texture, and quality.  My only disappointment is that they didn't have the kampachi that I adore so much!    The little things Japango did very well:  green tea, seaweed salad.  It sounds strange to point out these two things, but often I am disappointed in other Japanese establishments, as they either lack flavor, or are provided as an afterthought.  Both were really tasty here.  Will return again on my next trip, and recommend without reservation."}
{"text":"Even though the food is good, the service is TERRIBLE. My friend was waiting for me to arrive( I was running 15-20 mins late), so she asked to come in and take a table for two, the main guy said that they did not allow single person seating and asked her to vacate. Afterwards, she asked that whether she could take a seat at the chair in front of the exit (just a single chair staying there), and got a refusal. Then she asked whether she could sit in the chair if she orders right away, got a refusal again. When I arrived, we were seated and he would not take our order for a while, he took multiple orders from the neighbouring table and brought it. The table did not have a cutlery, and then the same waiter brought us one set of chopsticks only (we thought he was trying to ignore my friend).  Overall, we had a terrible experience. The service is getting worse and worse."}
{"text":"Japango roll, dragon and tempura eel sushi were awesome! Soft, creamy and served just in time to retain the warmness of the fresh rice (a rarity). Waiters were very courteous. Sushi stronger than kitchen items. Place is very tight. Watch the front step. Sushi was excellent.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not going to get into detail about how tiny this place is, but seriously, I can fit my whole family here only if they remove the tables.   Japango has been around for a long time, it was here back in my University days and business is still booming for them till now.   The best item here is their Japango Roll and Spider Roll (best I've had in the GTA). The soft shell crab was piping hot and crispy - I love how they use minimal rice so the contents of the sushi overpower the vinegary taste.   To save a few bucks, come during lunch hour. The chirashi is $16 at lunch time (till 2:30PM) and $21 at dinner time. Many other items are overpriced - $8 for an oyster shooter - the waiter got confused and advised me there would be 4 oysters in the shooter, but apologized for the miscommunication with the kitchen after I couldn't find the other 3 oysters.   I give them 3.5 Stars - I will be back when I'm craving for some spider deliciousness roll!"}
{"text":"Worst beef teriyaki i ever had... Too hard to bite. I can't finish my meal even it is a very small portion. Very expensive too."}
{"text":"Great sushi in a quaint atmosphere. The restaurant only fits about 20 people at once. Best to make reservations. Noticed that a few parties got turned away as they didn't have reservations and the house was fully booked for the evening. Worth taking the extra step of picking up the phone to reserve seating. The sushi is absolutely phenomenal. Highly recommend this Japango location."}
{"text":"Japango is relatively expensive compared to many other sushi places around town, but the food is noticeably better.  In particular try some of the non-sushi side and salads.  I also am particularly fond of their beef teriyaki, which is a nice cut of beef than many cheaper sushi restaurants would offer."}
{"text":"Were visiting friends in tdot and they said, \"Hey, let's go for sushi. We know an excellent spot and we've been going there for years\"  To them, we said, \"Ok. sounds good.\"  To each other, we said, \"Sure hope they know what they're talking about cause I can't stomach another lousy sushi dinner when the other couple picks the restaurant.\"   Walk in the door and the first thing we notice is that this sushi joint has room for approximately 10 patrons at a time.  Good sign.  Second thing we notice is that there's a wall of boxed chopsticks behind the sushi bar for the regular patrons.  We sit down and the waiter brings over two boxes with our friends' names on them.  Another good sign. They are definitely regulars.  Feeling relieved, we let our friends order for the table.    Within minutes, a parade of delicious fish begins making its way to our table.  Every single thing they ordered was fresh and tasty.  You know the expression \"making someone eat their words\"?  Well, that's pretty much exactly what happened here.  Talking smack about other people's regular sushi joint and having it turn out to be fantastic?  I can admit when I'm wrong. And can't wait to go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Japango did not hold up to it's reviews on here.  I went there today.  I arrived at a small restaurant.  It was cute and it had character.  The music and ambiance was the best feature for me.   And the place was tidy and clean. I started off with miso soup which was too salty.  And the green tea that was served to me was cold.      Moving on, I had california rolls, salmon sushi and unagi sushi.  They were all fresh - I was initially delighted.  Unagi is one of my personal favourite dishes.  I would rate theirs 6.5 out of 10 stars.  Their miso soup was salty.  Next I had their tempura.  It was chewy and not crispy at all.    Then drum roll....   My main dish arrived which was a salmon teriaki bento box.  It should of been the star attraction, however that star was so lack  lustre.  The salmon teriyaki was a bit on the dry side and definitely overcooked and their salad was bland.    In the end, the price was to too high for what you get.  If a restaurant is going to charge that high of a price I expect everything to be bang on, but japango missed the target."}
{"text":"I think this is over hyped place.  This review based on lunch time experience.  At first I was so surprised because it was soooooo tiny restaurant than I imagined.  And it was busy at lunch time but we could get table less than 5 min of waiting.   But it was the most uncompy table and chair ever!! So squeaky chair and table..was another minus. Also way too close with another customer's table. No one seems like enjoying and taking their time.  Anyways good service at a lunch time but felt too rushing.  Actually while I was eating  I could see almost every customer ask a box for the leftover.  Price was little expensive but they do good job on the food. They have good variety of fish.  I loved their sashimi which was so fresh nice cut.  For chicken teriyaki, they use dark meat. I like dark meat so it was okay:)"}
{"text":"With a name like \"Japango\", I had always mistaken this restaurant for a gimmicky chain restaurant with overpriced, not fresh sushi.  I was finally set straight by my trusted foodie friend and good thing she did, because Japango is one of the best sushi restaurants I've eaten at in Toronto.  They really seem to focus on freshness and quality, with specials going up when they've managed to procure something extra fresh and tasty, like live uni (sea urchin). I've been here a couple of times now and even the bentos are consistently really tasty.  The bentos that include raw fish are \"Chef's choice\" for fish, which to me is a good sign because it means they are being made with whatever is freshest / in season.  The chirashi don and nigiri sushi have this delicious roast garlic oil on them which take the fish to a whole new level.  The service is efficient and pleasant.  The space itself is tiny and if I had one complaint, it would be that when it's cold outside and someone opens the door, you really feel the chill.  If you just look at price alone, you can find cheaper sushi, but it would definitely not be of the same calibre. I would much rather pay Japango's prices for such fresh, tasty sushi."}
{"text":"In every city that I visit, I have to find a perfect sushi spot and keep it in mind for the next time that I come. Japango is that place that I've filed away in my mental rolodex for any future Toronto trips.  We were in the Dundas square area, and Japango was close by. It's a very small restaurant, probably only holds about 15 people, so lunch time would probably be a bad time of the day to find an open table. But if by chance you are able to find an open spot, it is so well worth it!  The fish is so fresh, it literally melts in your mouth. I had a few pieces of salmon sashimi a rainbow roll, and the Japango roll. Soooo good, I highly recommend all of them! I also had grilled tuna collar as well, perfection!  The only problem that I had was when my girlfriend asked what was in their version of the tempura roll, the waitress began to tell her the definition of tempura. It seemed like a very condescending response....that incident is the only reason my review isn't a 5."}
{"text":"I visited Japango on July 1st around 9pm for dinner.  First thing that came to mind was how small the restaurant is.   I've read quite a few reviews about Japango having terrible service however my friend and I received our food pretty quickly and everyone was very welcoming.   Although Japango is a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant, I would for sure go back again. The food is AMAZING. We ordered the sashimi dinner, tuna rolls, spicy salmon roll, agedashi tofu and black sesame ice cream.  Everything we ordered was fresh and full of flavour. Although this place isn't cheap, you do get what you pay for which is amazing quality sushi."}
{"text":"OMG, I feel terrible for giving this joint a 2-star rating! =*( Since I was on vacation in Toronto, you know I was on the hunt for the best sushi nearby my hotel. After much Yelp research, I finally settled for this one and took a taxi to get to it.   This place is SOOOO small!!! I think my hotel room was bigger (no joke because I did get a 1br suite). Anyway, so I'm thinking, maybe the food will make up for it's size.. Cause... you know... size doesn't always matter *wink, wink, nudge, nudge*  Our food comes out -- Various rolls and shashimi -- and it was just MEDIOCRE. What a bummer!! I mean, yes, the shashimi was fresh, but the slices were so thin. Maybe we are spoiled in Cali with our thick slices of fresh shashimi, but I wanted to cry.   I'm so thankful to be back in Cali where everyone is fat because we're getting served large portions."}
{"text":"This place continues to be my favourite sushi place in Toronto. I come here often and it never disappoints.   I never know what will be on the chefs menu but always know it will be the freshest sushi possible. I know I can count on the excellence of the preparation, the beauty of the presentation, and the professionalism of the service.  It is tiny, and if you haven't been here before or aren't up for \"sorry no room\" then call ahead.  There are many days when immersion in Japanese culture through the food is a tonic. Today is one. I am grateful Japango is on my walk home."}
{"text":"My all-time fave quality sushi joint.... I have high standards in sushi u could say, so once in a while when I feel like having real tasty quality sushi, this is my spot. On the pricier side but u pay for the excellent sashimi cuts, sushi rolls, dishes... Love the ambiance and venue. Tiny, cozy, but staff is down to earth and friendly, non-pretentious. Like everything ive had there- all of the sushi rolls except for the one with cheese inside it (forgot name, maybe philadelphia) - the tuna tataki, etc etc, i forget exactly what i order each time but im never disappointed. A hole-in-the-wall wonder, hope it doesn't expand bigger than what it is because it is charming exactly the way it is! And who would've ever thought this place was right in the backyard of Eaton Center and City Hall!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Sushi! Fantastic atmosphere and great service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Cold tea, watered down soya sauce, miniscule portions of not very fresh wakame salad served by rude unattentive staff. Yeah I won't be back here despite the good reviews"}
{"text":"The most fresh sushi I've ever had! I feel like this isn't a place for everyone but I'd highly recommend if you're looking for really fresh sashimi. The space is very small so don't go as a big group."}
{"text":"Go, go, Japango! Yikes, that was cheesy, even for me...  For my past late-nights-at-work dinners, Japango was my only highlight to those awfully long days - my regular order was the Sashimi Delux Dinner plus an uzura + ikura sushi (quail's egg on salmon roe).  Love the garlicky oil gently slicked on top of some of \"fishier\" types, making even butterfish delectable and surface-torched sea bream unctuous. Markedly fresh seafood, I really feel that the quality is equal to the price.  They also have a regular, daily/weekly special menu featuring their recommended items, usually seafood at the height of freshness or seasonality.   Service is friendly, but seeing as it's a highly popular place despite its small interior, the wait staff can be very busy.  They work hard to be efficient though, and work with a high level of familiarity and an economy of movement within the tiny interior.  Being a regular (if you appear 2-3 times a week) earns you a personal set of chopsticks in a personal wooden box marked with your signature, in a coveted spot hung behind the sushi bar chef wall.  The only downside is that Japango is a very small hole-in-the-wall type of place (so Tokyo!) where the tables are tightly crammed in so be prepared for some cozy seating.  I recommend that if you're planning on coming here, bring a clutch or another equally small bag, else you get stuck trying to squeeze out, happily satiated!"}
{"text":"Japango roll is very small, not like the pictures shown. Their service is good, but the food is very expensive. We spent $60 for two people, but we are not full. The small box in wow sushi is much better and cheaper than Japango. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a weekday and thought I was safe since we went around 7pm. We were lucky to arrive when we did because there were only 2 other tables available. This place is tiny, comparable to most Toronto living rooms.  If you want to be able to have an intimate conversation, this is not the place to go. If you are looking for yummy fresh fish like you've heard of but have yet to taste, this is THE place. I've yet to experience yellowtail quite so delicious and fresh as I did here. Their crunchy rolls aren't overdone with huge chunks of tempura but with tiny light flakes of crunchy goodness. They had blue fin tuna which I've never seen on other menus which is a must try! Skip the soft shell crab which is minuscule and a waste of tummy room considering the fresh offerings here."}
{"text":"Walking over to Japango on a Saturday afternoon, my initial impression was that this was just another whole-in-the-wall sushi spot, but that couldn't be farther from the truth! The rolls we ordered (Japango, Hawaiian, Crunchy Spicy Tuna) came out beautifully presented. With the first bite, we could tell that everything from the freshness of the fish to the quality of the rice was among the best we'd ever tasted. Having grown up in San Francisco and spending the last two years in Seattle, good sushi was always well within reach. Still, I can easily say that Japango may very well top the list."}
{"text":"I enjoyed our visit to Japango, and the sushi was absolutely delicious. The line ups are always long so I would recommend making a reservation to avoid disappointment.  I ordered the salmon and green onion roll and my friend had the dragon and rainbow rolls. The sushi was excellent and comparable to (if not better than) Wow Sushi.  Although the food itself is good, the service was slow and the waitress didn't check on us, nor did we get any tea. The restaurant itself is very small and cramped, but I guess this is part of the attraction."}
{"text":"This review is probably gonna be paid by the owner to remove. Service is horrible, do not dine in. I was placed by the door in a freezing weather. I asked to move my chair in by a few inches and got rejected with the rudest tone ever. Later when people started lining up by the door, I was literally pinned to the table. The owner bursted into an argument with me moving my seat as the \"chair should be staying wherever they are placed\". This is the worst experience I have ever had with my dinners and the most racist ever.   Seriously what was the owner thinking ?"}
{"text":"Tiny little restaurant hidden at 122 Elizabeth St. Make a reservation to guarantee a table - they only have approx. 10, but don't be late or they'll give your table away due to the limited amount of seating.   The rolls are good and the fish is very fresh, but the tuna tartar was disappointing, lacking in flavor. The spicy salmon and spider rolls were amazing, but stick to the rolls and sashimi because the dinners are not good.   For apps,  Asian Pear Salad is sublime, and for dessert the Black Sesame Ice Cream was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about. The sushi is good, but not amazing and the service is HORRENDOUS. You can definitely get better sushi in the city. We had to ask our server twice to take our order. I love spicy food and pour hot sauce on everything, but the spicy rolls we ordered were over the top spicy. What really pissed off is when he took my beer away like I was finished with it! I still had a quarter left! Lastly, as others have said the space is super tight. It should just be a carry out joint,you can barely hear a thing. There are better options--try SAKU."}
{"text":"Not bad for a small restaurant. V busy = fresh sushi. Table turnover rate v high in lunch. Authentic for a Canadian Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm very confused about this place. I went out of the way to eat here while I was in Toronto for work due to the great reviews being posted but I couldn't even finish my chirashi bowl because the fish just wasn't up to par. Some of them felt too slimy and tasted old."}
{"text":"The selection was decent.  I got the Japango roll, the white tuna nigiri and the fatty tuna nigiri.  The seating was a bit small and nothing about the flavors or freshness of the fish really stood out."}
{"text":"This review is not for food but for service.  My husband and I had reservations for 8.30 on a Friday night. I called and made a reservation since I had read about the place being small and didn't want to wait. We arrive 5mins before 8.30 and see four people waiting for tables. They tell me that they had made reservations for 7.45 and are still waiting.   8.25pm: It's really cold outside and I'm about to ask my husband to come in and wait (there was place for two more people to stand) when the waiter(or manager... Not sure) asked me to wait outside and that we would have a table in 5 mins.   8.30pm: I go out and wait... It starts snowing now and more people come and few leave.  8.40pm: A couple went to the store across and waited and another couple that came after us went inside and stood. The waiter/manager didn't ask them to wait outside and they were safe from the biting cold of Feb 13th.   8.45pm: My husband now was losing patience so I go in and ask how long it would be (the 7.45 people are still waiting too). He tells me 5 mins and thats what he tells to the other couple who came after us too.  8.55pm: Its still snowing and the wind is to much to bear. I take one last peek through the window, notice that people are still eating main course and leave.  I agree that one cannot ask a customer to finish up and leave (whish is what the server told me), but making a customer who has reservations wait is not fair either.  He didn't let my husband and I wait inside but let another couple and thats ok too.  The least he could have done is provided us with a cup of hot tea which he apparently serves for free to people inside but not to customers standing out in the cold.  I know that waiting for 20/25 mins doesn't seems like a big deal but in winter and outside, even 5 mins seems long.  We obviously had a hard time finding another place since most places had a wait time and finally found a table at Kimchi Korea House which had pretty good food.  PS: No body was rude to us but the server just seemed indifferent and unapologetic."}
{"text":"Favourite Chirashi place!!! You can't miss it!!!! Very hard to get a seat on weekend nights. Warm and family style look. And the price is higher than sushi shops on Bloor west."}
{"text":"The food is so so ( little bit better than other sushi restaurant nearby) but I am sure you can find same quality sushi in a cheaper price, the servers are nice except sometimes they let you sit right beside the door if you come along."}
{"text":"Every time I come back here for regular Japanese food, I love it.  The last time I was here in was 2011 for omakase which I did not enjoy.  The regular food though? OMG. I walked 5 subway stations JUST TO COME HERE, passing at least 15 of those generic, Chinese-run sushi restaurants where you know the fish is just not as fresh and they're very likely to throw some disgusting mayonnaise-based sauce all over it, or mash up some salmon ends and call it sashimi.  This place has super fresh, authentic, real pieces of sushi. You can't go wrong. I took the Sashimi One, which had 16 wonderful pieces of fresh fish (some lightly seared to bring out the flavour). I requested no fake crab but obviously it wouldn't come in something that costs $16 for 16 pieces of fish.  Fabulous. Made my day to eat it."}
{"text":"The problem with sushi in Canada is that its mostly saturated with cheap Chinese/Korean establishments that really obscure the meaning behind having simple, fresh sushi (as opposed to an assortment of rolls + 16 different sauces drizzled on top). At least thats what I enjoy when I eat sushi.  I finally found Japango after hearing about it on Yelp - a small sushi place near Dundas Square.  I went there for dinner and ordered one of the sushi sets which turned out to be a variety of sushi and sashimi on a plate. The things that stood out for me were the eel and the sea urchin.  It was probably one of the best eel sushi experiences I've ever had as it was really spongey and it melted in my mouth. The sushi in general was really, really fresh as well.   The person who I dined with ordered another set that turned to be a 3 course dinner complete with salad and miso, assortment of sushi, and grilled salmon with a sweet soy reduction. It was more than he could handle so I decided to try some of his grilled salmon. The salmon was good, but it didn't blow my mind.  I feel that if you go to a restaurant like Japango, you should order the nigiri sushi and avoid the cooked food section altogether (even avoid the rolls). Not because the cooked food section is bad or anything but because the sushi is the sole reason why you would come to such a restaurant. The main ingredient here is definitely the fish.   This place is expensive no doubt, but it's really worth splurging at least once to remind yourself of the nuances of simple, fresh sushi that countless other sushi restaurants in Toronto tend not to appreciate."}
{"text":"Amazingggggggg! Been here twice and never disappointed. Super tiny, quaint and cozy. Makes for a unique experience but isn't ideal for groups (it's really tight)!   The japango roll was absolutely the most delicious roll I've ever out in my mouth! Okay at least top 5! So fresh, full of flavour, and rich and buttery due to the sauce and torched flavour of the sashimi topping. I ordered two to myself!   I also had the uni sushi that was amazingly fresh and buttery. I'm an uni fanatic and this was the best I've had in at least 6 months!   Overall absolutely worth every penny. By no means is it cheap, but for this level of quality, I could die today and be happy.    Mmmmmm mmm...."}
{"text":"Japango was recommended by a couple of friends a while back but I only got to try it recently since it's located downtown and a bit far from where I live. The quality of the sushi (from the freshness of the fish to the taste, texture and stickiness of the sushi rice) is way above the ones that you get from All-you-can-eat sushi places which have been popping up everywhere."}
{"text":"Sorry fellow yelpers, not a huge fan of this place.   After reading so many above average reviews and also having a close friend suggesting this place to me, I decided to try it for myself.   Its a given this place is pretty small and makes waiting for a table that much more ridiculous. It gets pretty intimate whenever someone enters or tries to leave the restaurant. (a little annoying too)  When I finally did get a seat (outside aisle seat) after 5 mins I got elbowed in the head by this dude sitting beside me leaving and putting on his jacket. (maybe this contributed to my bad experience) Buddy didnt even apologize but being the gentleman I am I just let it pass. (that mofo!)  While we were deciding on what to order I tend to always order the same thing If im trying a Japanese place for the first time. I ordered the sashimi deluxe dinner and an Oyako-don. It is pretty hard to screw up an Oyako don, its like screwing up a pizza) but this place somehow managed to do it. The people beside me looked at what I was eating (They looked like first timers too) and I gave my honest opinion. (Rated 18+) PG version = \"Dont order this!\"  The Sashimi Deluxe dinner was more like a sashimi appetizer.. it was definately not worth the price. (Mind you Im not cheap, I pay the same price for a normal sashimi dinner at Fune and wont complain about it.) So I wasnt too impressed about this dish.   Dont really comment on the washroom but I feel I should for this place. Its small as heck! Its like being in jail or something. Not a great experience.   And whats with this eclectic taste for interior decor. Japanese Geisha dolls with pictures of Lord of the Rings characters scattered everywhere. C'mon now!  This place will get 0.9 stars from me but they do not have a decimal place on the rating system.   My advance apologies to the owners and people that like this place."}
{"text":"Excellent !!! Food incredible, service fast and efficient! I recommend it 100%. The price was really good compared to the food/service. It is a small and romantic, asiatic deco, resto in Toronto, downtown. You must stop by when you are in town!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this cozy, hole in the wall place near Yonge-Dundas square. One of the best sashimi/sushi combo places around.  It is a very small place so make sure you reserve a table in advance. Not for big groups in my opinion (it sits 15 people maximum based on what I saw). Servers were extremely polite, our server could not speak English very well but tried her best to answer our questions. The one star deduction is because of their prices; a bit higher than average in my opinion. They have an extensive a la carte menu for sushi and sashimi. If you want to try sushi you have never tried before, check out their a la carte menu. I loved their raw quail egg sushi (and it looked good)."}
{"text":"Visited her earlier in the summer with my girlfriend. We arrived around 7:00pm without a reservation. We were told we could get a table in 30 min. We didn't mind waiting and went down the street for a coffee. 30 minutes later we were seated in the restaurant. We ordered tempura, sashimi, and 2 rolls. The fish was fresh and very good. My one complaint and the reason I wouldn't return is due to the service. Our male waiter seemed impatient and rushed us to order, serve our food and give us our bill. We probably would have ordered more food and stayed to chat since we were having a girls night."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Amazingly fresh. Reminded me of Tokyo. Little restaurant. Great atmosphere. Great staff. I would suggest a reservation."}
{"text":"First off, this is not a completely authentic Japanese sushi restaurant, but it does hit the mark in a number of key ways.   First, the chef's choice and preparation of fish is very good. I went on New Year's Eve which is usually a food wasteland, especially for fish, and I was quite surprised that there was both o-toro and madai on the menu. While neither was as good as the best I've had in Japan, it was fresh, flavourful and well presented. A 5/10 by Tsukiji standards and a 10/10 by Toronto standards. That's right, I think this is the best sushi I've had in Toronto. I hate to make a final judgement by one visit alone, however, the 10 foot line of preferred customer's personal chopsticks on the wall definitely shows this place as a loyal and regular following.   Secondly, there are a lot of fairly authentic appetizer dishes like hamachi cheek and yaki nasu. Both of these examples were good.  Frankly, there aren't a lot of great sushi restaurants in Toronto and not a lot of great restaurants near this location period so this is a bit of a gem. As others have said, it's small so go at off hours or make a reservation.   I will say that my only criticism was that the service was a little too pushy. I understand it's a small place and they have to turn tables, but I'm ordering $100 of fish. A true Japanese restaurant would nurture more customer enjoyment when it's clear they appreciate the premium dishes. Lastly, there are the other caveats of the comical bathroom (actually pretty identical to most restaurants in Japan), the door that blows ice cold air in every time it opens, the lack of a sushi bar to sit at, and the slightly off \"not-really-japanese\" things like nobody speaking japanese and no sushi bar... at the end of the day, they could work to fix some of these things and I hope they do, because I want to make this my regular spot."}
{"text":"Probably the best sashimi I've had in the city. I usually skip the sushi and go straight for sashimi because it's THAT good. I don't want rice to get in the way :) haha. It's a small little place, so they wont be able to accommodate large groups. On the pricier end, but it's worth it. Go with whatever the chef suggests!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite spot in Toronto for sushi. It is a small understated restaurant that seats less than 20 people. They have a great attentive staff that are always working hard but seems to  really enjoy their work. Japango has a large selection of sashimi and sushi which is excellently prepared prepared with fish that is always extremely fresh. The maki is equally good and I would suggest that you try the Japango signature roll. There are also a number of great appetizers that I would recommend including: tune & avocado tartar, kaki fry and the agedashi tofu.   Another great feature of Japango are their prices. Considering the quality of the food the prices are extremely reasonable.   I really enjoy this spot and make a point to visit Japango each time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place out but most of the food and service was a disappointment. Called in ahead to check if they do anything for birthdays and the waitress who answered said yes so I went ahead and reserved a table for my family and I for my sisters bday. However once I got there I asked again and they said they don't do anything..... They don't allow you to bring in your own cake. Also they \"ran out\" of all the desserts...  I got there 10 minutes earlier than my appointment, the restaurant is super small and cramped! I see that our tables are reserved but the server said for me to wait until my whole party was here. There is suppose to be 3 chairs in the front for people to sit but instead they rather put their uber eats take out on them so I had to stand outside.  Once we got seated it felt like they kept rushing us and even told us we only get the table for maximum 1 hour.   The food is alright but I was expecting it to be very good because of the price and location.  The really good items I would get again would be the uni sashimi/sushi and the flying fish roe with quail egg.  Everything else was mediocre.  We had to follow up with our server a couple times for a missing order.  It was a super dim restaurant! And super cramped. Literally no room to move and no where to place any items or our purses. So if you come from shopping, beware.  I will probably not come back again."}
{"text":"Great little sushi restaurant near the Eatons Centre.  The menu is very extensive and the sushi is fresh. The server is very professional and efficient. Food comes out at the speed of lightning. My only issue which may be trivial to others is that the restaurant is very tight so you are constantly bumping elbows with the neighbouring tables."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the ingredients are fresh. To top that, great atmosphere and great location (right by Eaton centre). Space is a little tight though. Make sure to make a reservation before you go there. A little pricey but would come back again for special occasions."}
{"text":"My husband decided he wanted to try the special chef's menu at Japango so we went.    Personally, I don't feel comfortable spending too much money on food but for my husband, food is his life and he is willing to splurge.  I opted for the vegetable udon instead and it was delicious!!!  Albeit a little on the small side, the noodles were the perfect texture and chewiness - and tasted very fresh!  The broth was light and flavourful too.  Very good :)  As for the chef's menu ... it was definitely over priced (in my husband's opinion) and definitely left him hungrier than when we arrived.  I think the cost is $70ish dollars and you get 7 or 8 dishes.  The portions are TEENY ... and he shared with me and our little guy - whereas I didn't really share my noodles with him.  And the only reason I didn't really share my meal with him was because he wanted to save himself for all the dishes from the chef's menu.  And unfortunately these dishes came out SLOW ... I think it took like 1.5 hours for all the dishes to come out.   So by that time, I was already finished my noodles and both the little guy and I were sampling his ... so, poor guy left feeling hungry and disappointed.   Basically, the Chef's Menu is quite nice for dainty eaters but is not quite a good fit for buffet lovers."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years but decided to return for a quick sushi fix because I was craving uni and hotate so bad. Read the reviews on yelp and many people recommended the Japango roll (California sushi with salmon and hotate on top). Definitely worth it. We ordered a la carte amberjack, hotate, uni and toro. They seared the hotate which killed the taste of it which I didn't enjoy but their uni.. Oh my gawd so good.   Anyway. I would definitely return for a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"Such fresh, high-quality fish! We ordered an assortment of sushi a la carte, but it was the unagi, uni, botan ebi and hotate that really stood out for me.   We arrived very early for our reservation but were accommodated, and our server was both attentive and pleasant for someone who was juggling 6-7 different groups at once. The space is definitely intimate but perfect for a small group or a date. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow,   Unique, tiny sushi and other japanese food restaurant so close to city hall and University Ave, but you'd never know it was there! I found it with the great reviews here (and on Chowhound).  I got 2 rolls, with a cost of $20. So, it's not cheap. But I think it might be addictive. They use a blowtorch a plenty, so many of the fish is not actually raw. But, this is certainly a creative authentic Japanese thing to do. There was also some oil floating around my take out tray, so I suspect it is not even as healthy as many sushi places.  I wish the menu was online. I got the spicy tuna and some $11 roll. Both were excellent, filled with fish and both packed a little punch. Will be back, but it's not an everyday lunch place because of the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened many years ago when I was still living on Elizabeth 8 years ago. Visit for the first time celebrating anniversary with my love.   **Need to call and make reservations ahead** There were so many people walking in and had to leave due to no tables available. If you're late for your reserved time they will not save your spot or call you and check-in to see if you're still coming or not.   Super small restaurant, I'm unsure of how authentic their menu is since their sashmi don was korean styled. Yet, their moriawase we ordered that evening was very fresh, very authentic. Their menu prices increased compared to the menu prices shown online*  It is quite a challenge to eat here because if you carry a lot (like winter coats) it'll definitely be uncomfortable as tables were small, everyone sat close to each other, limited moving spaces.   We also ordered otoro sushi (chef made it 2 way, one in nigiri the other in gunkan maki) @ $16. Fish was fresh, real otoro, real fatty, real flavorful and nice simple plating.   Sashmi don- I like it with soya sauce and wasabi in Japanese way instead of mixing it with the Korean hot sauce they gave us. The don was a good deal imo, a lot of chopped sashimi.    A lot of people ordered take out, busy, and for sure very intimate!"}
{"text":"My friend told me this was the best sushi in town and that if I wanted a real sushi experience that she would take me, since my experience so far were the all you can eat places on Spadina.  Surprised such a popular place could exist in a quiet side street but on entering I could see why.   The place is small, way too small to go on a date or expect any privacy and your pretty much rubbing shoulders with the table next to you. Not my kind of place at all so already I wanted to make haste.  So sat down and ordered some tea and started with what i was told was Japango. I prefer my sushi kind of cooked so having raw fish was a big ask but I actually enjoyed the sushi and if you can drag me away from Spadina and the all you can eat places I might come back here.   I also ordered the chicken teriyaki after reading Edwin's review but I was not such a big fan of it, the sauce was nice but the chicken was too dry and crispy.   Overall an okay place with food which I honestly could not appreciate in a cramped venue."}
{"text":"My two friends and I arrived here around 2 pm yesterday for a late lunch and managed to get a table right away. This place is just as small as other reviewers have commented on so I was glad we went at an off peak hour. It is a tight squeeze, I kept hitting my knees on the table, as well as bumping into everything getting in and out of the bench seat at the table, but don't let that scare you away.   We were given tea upon being seated and you can tell they want you in and out as quickly as possible to maximize their small space. This meant that service from beginning to end was quick and efficient.    I got the lunch sashimi combo one which comes with 12 pieces of sashimi, a bowl of rice, and miso soup for $18. I would usually order a roll, but after reading reviews I decided to order sashimi because other reviewers had said their fish is very fresh. I will have to say I agree and was really happy with the selection of fish I received, along with their taste and quality. Out of the 12 pieces of sashimi, I got to try 6 different kinds, which was a huge plus for me. I thought everything was great, including the price."}
{"text":"Very, very good Japanese. Wide selection of fish (but they were missing Ankimo last time I checked), cozy and small, order sushi on the fly directly to the sushi chef. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I decided to check out this place based on a friend's recommendation. Now she recommended lunch and I went during dinner so that might affect my impression.  1. Very small place. It's a hole in the wall kind of joint with probably only 4 tables that are elbow to elbow. So, if you aren't fond of people listening in on your tableside convo this might not be the place for you.  2. Presentation of the Dishes Were Beautiful - I do admit I give them +1 for this since I find a lot of sushi restaurants lack the artistry that is so important to true Japanese sushi. Now this place isn't run by Japanese (I knew from the name alone) but they have maintained some aspects well.  3. Pricey. Perhaps this is because I went during dinner so they don't have any specials during these hours. But I do say for the freshness of the product served the price is reasonable. However, I found the portion sizes rather bleak (there was barely any rice - which is usually not an issue). Skip the edamame, so not worth the price for the amount given.  4. Selection of Sushi is Nice - Great to see a place not just offering dynamite rolls and spicy tuna. They have a good variety of fish and don't try to sell off tilapia as red snapper (ah my pet peeve !!). Something about the rice I wasn't crazy for... but that might just be my high standards.  So at this point I'm not completely sold on this place since I just don't see the price matching the food compared to other true Japanese run places I've been to."}
{"text":"I've had the absolute most horrendous experience at this restaurant. My friend and I made a reservation for two at 7:45pm. I arrived before that and the manager told me that I had to wait for my friend to arrive before being seated - I thought that was fair since I was early. My friend was travelling to the restaurant from work during rush hour and came 5 minutes late. The manager then knowingly asked for the name the reservation was made under and the time of the reservation once again just to smirkingly say, \"well you missed your reservation\". We were confused as to why we were being treated that way because no one told us about such policies - not even the employee who made the reservation with us over the phone. He insisted that he has trained his staff and he's sorry that WE don't understand their \"strict\" restaurant policy. It is completely ridiculous to treat customers this way - considering I did arrive early and my friend showed up at a reasonable time frame. Not to mention there were empty tables that didn't have reservations until half an hour later according to him. His attitude was completely appalling and when confronted he denied his lack of manners. No matter how good their food rumours to be I'll never be going back. I'm not surprised that the employee on the phone has failed to deliver the policies from their end - especially under the management of that disrespectful, uneducated manager."}
{"text":"Zero stars really. I was shocked at my experience given all the positive reviews I saw. I was dining by myself and so got seated quickly but was not offered anything to drink. I had ample time just to observe the place. The restaurant is small about ten tables. One table had a family of four who ordered very simple rolls, mostly cooked and other cooked items like dumplings. Another table had a dinner set. Another table had rolls and I overheard them wanting hot sauce in and outside the roll. So my initial observations was that not everyone was coming for the fish.   Then when I started to order I was told they were missing a few things like sweet shrimp, American uni, surf clam. Understandable but still annoying. I ended up with the salmon sashimi, Ikura sushi, escolar sushi and eel sushi. The sushi comes as two per order and sashimi as three per order. As I waited for the sushi I even double checked to make sure I had the right place as the chefs didn't look super clean and constantly looked annoyed. They we also very busy with takeout orders. Just not a very relaxing atmosphere.   The food came and that is when things went south, the ikura was tasteless making me wonder if it was imitation food I was eating. The eel tasted old like it was past due. The escolar was a little better but again not fresh tasting. Mind you I've had all these things before so I know what good pieces taste like. But the worse was yet to come. The salmon sashimi was horrible. I don't know how you can botch that. Three rolled up pieces that had portions of the skin on them and scored. Scored to help me bite through it as they were super chewy. I've never ever had something so disgusting and I ended up leaving it. I reluctantly left a tip as it was the right thing to do. I wish I had said something to the chef but as soon as I finished the meal they promptly handed me the bill and I wanted out."}
{"text":"Yes, I ate here because of Will L.'s review (thanks Will!). After a day of shopping and cupcakes \"in the big city,\" we were ready for some real food. My friend and I are definitely suburb folks, so we were running on Yelp for tonight's dinner. Couldn't have been happier! It's a tiny place, but the sushi is fresh and delicious. The staff are friendly, and easy to wave down if you need something. Prices are reasonable, and it's a great location. Recommended for your sushi fix downtown!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to this restaurant for a while and I'm so glad I did! The quality of fish is really good, so fresh! I had the chirashi don. The tuna that came with it just melts in your mouth. I also tried the unagi don which was good for the price, but I have had better elsewhere.  The only thing I didn't like about the restaurant was how small it was. There are so little tables that it's not so easy to get a seat. Also the tables are small, so I kept bumping my knee into it.   A lot of customers came in to pick up take out, which is a great idea. Definitely going to order take out from here some day."}
{"text":"My go-to place for exceptional sushi downtown. The fish is always fresh and expertly prepared. I usually get the chef's tasting menu and it never fails to disappoint.  You pay for what you get so this is definitely not a cheap joint. Another downside is that this is literally a hole in the wall so seats are very limited and tight. But if you want to try some of Toronto's best sushi, go go to Japango"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had at this price point.  It's a $$ restaurant that tastes like a $$$$ place.  Sushi is fresh and beautifully made. Melts in your mouth.  Lunch specials are a beautiful deal."}
{"text":"Japango - Maki Rolls Are For Suckers  For all true Japanese sushi restaurants only order the specials or the omakse.  Anything else there are cheaper options.  O Japango, Japango, wherefore art thou, Japango.  Oh yeah at Bay and Dundas.  Please, oh please, when you go to Japango do not order rolls.  This makes old ladies cry.  It makes puppies sad.  It also is kind of a waste of time.  Rolls are rolls are rolls.  They can be fun and creative and can be constructed in thousands of combinations from raw to cooked.  However, why rolls people?  Japango and a few others will take a whole live fish, take out the meat and serve the meat sashimi style alongside the body.  Rolls what?  Rolls who?  Japango, though it serves middle road dishes like California rolls, also serves up some amazing daily and weekly specials.  Go for it.  Try something different.  Learn the word \"Omakase.\"  Trust the chef.      Like I said, you will not find this on any menu and have to ask for the specials.  What presentation.  Fried Grouper, with the meat taken out and served on the fish it came from.  Connect the eater with source of the food.  Isn't that just peachy keen?  Their \"Omakase\" sashimi plate had Aji or Spanish Mackerel with the meat removed and served with the fish it was taken from.  Menus suck!!!  You must note that Japango is a tiny place with some old decor but this is something that should be embraced.  The small space is very Japanese and if you think about the undertaking of ensuring high quality, fresh fish served raw, you do not want a large restaurant.  Large restaurants serving raw fish scare me.  Restaurants in general serving any food have a hard enough time with noodles let alone raw fish.  If a place reaks of Japan and they serve Japanese food, then you are good.     This is the Japango Chef in the 3rd person.  \"Man what a long day.  I got some obscenely fresh fish from my fishmonger, ensured the ones that were alive were transported properly to my restaurant to keep the subtle flavours and some guy orders California rolls.  I am not mad just confused as to why they won't try the real stuff.  I should remove the menu all together.  Maybe not.  I gutted a huge monkfish today also, used the meat for a fried dish and harvested the livers.  I ground the livers down to a paste and formed them into a roll, wrapped it in plastic wrap, then set them in the fridge to form.  I created this insane yuzu gelatin to go garnish it, yet someone orders Teriyaki in a bento box.  I slave over perfecting rice, I make my own soya sauce and infuse it with things like dashi and sometimes kombu and yet tempura shrimp is the most popular.  You know no one has bought me a beer during their meal in at least a week.  I love it when grateful customers do that.  Anyway, got to go get the freshest fish, still alive from the back, meticulously separate the meat from the bones, cut around blood lines and convert it into a perfect dish.  Hopefully someone notices today and says thank you.  I am sure glad my sous chef does the rolls and not me...oh boy.\""}
{"text":"Only seats 20.  The freshest sashimi i have had in a long time.  Great service. Killer atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the chirashi don, and it was quite mediocre in terms of taste, freshness and price-value. It wasn't bad, but there's better options around here. Service was very slow, and there were a fly flying around our table... It was also very crammed"}
{"text":"Horrendous and arrogant service from a male waiter / possible owner.  Came here with only one party ahead of us. The male server told my friend and I that we could be seated but could be a 30 minute wait. A larger table of 4 showed up after us. After about 20 minutes we were called and sat at a table with 4 seats. We were about to order when that same server told us to leave and he would seat the party of 4 who came after us. He told us he meant to call the party of 4 and we needed to leave. He practically pushed us out the door. We asked if there was another table opening soon and he said we couldn't eat there. No explanation given.  The experience was embarrassing and he didn't even apologize. We waited for nothing even though he said we could be seated. Avoid this restaurant if you want common decency from your waiters."}
{"text":"Upon walking into this very small restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly waiter. Even though it was way past lunch time around 1:45, the place was still full. Luckily didn't have to wait long for seats.  We ordered the sashimi bento and the sushi bento, each $14.  There's sashimi, and then there's JAPANGO sashimi. It was so tasty.. props to the chef who prepped it. Super fresh and thick slices that were well cut. My favourites were the charred butterfish, but the salmon was also scrumptious. The tofu in the Bento was thinly breaded, fried, and immersed in a sweet sauce. Love it! Also served with some radish variation, seaweed salad, carrot, miso soup, and rice. The only aspect of the Bento I was soso about was the salad dressing, which was too gingery for my taste.  Therefore: come here for the awesome sashimi. You shall not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the omakase at Japango. I have not tried their regular menu and have heard good things about it so we wanted to try their omakase. unfortunately it was quite disappointing. the food was average and not worth the price of $120. we ordered a kinmon sake and they gave us the bottle and 2 glasses.... not even real sake cups. We have been to other omakase but compared to our previous experiences, this was very rushed... no explanation on what we are being served, the food was just placed at our table. The salads were ok.. nothing special, same with the gindara. the sashimi were very thinly sliced, they were fresh enough. The soba was just regular soba with the regular  dip. Black sesame ice cream tastes like the ones i can get from the chinese grocery. For the price we paid here, I would recommend trying a different place for Omakase. Definitely not worth it. as an aside ... my daughter ordered from their regular menu and loved it."}
{"text":"Pure racist restaurant.. we were waiting for a long time and another couple was given preference even though they didn't have reservation."}
{"text":"I was shocked at how terrible this place was, I wanted to love it so bad. Food 7/10, Atmosphere 5/10, Service 0/10.  One line conclusion: First and last experience with the 1-Hour limit Japango.  Let's start with food.  Food: My friends and I shared the Japango Roll, Assorted Rolls and Chirashi. It was alright, I didn't think anything was supremely fresh or remarkable. I think the Japango Roll was the best, it was quite yummy, but the portions are rather small. $13 for the plate, it wasn't enough for any of us short Asians so be ready to order more.  Atmosphere:  Very, very cramped. You can hear everything people around you are saying even if you try not to. My friend complained it was too dark inside to see anything but I thought she was just exaggerating - you can see, but it's true that it's pretty dark. Also, next to where I was seated, there was a big piece of noodle on the seat. Gross.  Service:  As soon as I walked in (5:25ish), I said I made a reservation (for 5:30) and gave my name. The place was pretty empty. They kept getting my name wrong over the phone, and the waitress said, \"MarK?\" to me in person. I have never met a girl named Mark, but I just thought the blunder was cute and got seated. She told me to sit right next to another group of people, and I noticed how annoyed she seemed right away. At that time the restaurant was not crowded, as there were only the 2 people next to my table. She spent most of her time joking over the bar with one of the sushi chefs (in Korean, interestingly).  My friends were all running late since they got off work late or were caught in traffic. At around 5:40, the waitress stalked to my table and asked where my friends were. I replied they were on their way, and she said, \"Can you text them?\" I replied, confused, \"They're in the subway right now, so I can't reach them as of now\" She sighed impatiently and said, \"We can't wait for you forever, we have other reservations too, please let them know to hurry up.\"  I honestly just sat there, surprised. I have never had such blatantly bad and confrontational service, nonetheless in a Japanese restaurant. She never asked please (text), or sorry for the inconvenience (since I'm kicking you out soon, see below), or anything - I worked in customer service and not only is it absolutely rude to say that as a waitress, it's simply entitled and rude as a human being. It's not like being mad will solve anything. I'm sorry that my friends are late, but we will leave as instructed by the hour mark so we won't be an inconvenience to the business; what is the need to be rude and abrasive?  Later through the night, she served other people tea but skipped our table. I thought that was not just very immature but also... weird. I just don't get it. There were 2 other servers (3 in total) so they helped us out instead. The only time the original server came back to speak with us was to inform us that we only have 1 hour in the restaurant. We nodded dumbly and took note to stuff our mouths, and hightail it out of there."}
{"text":"Arrived around 12pm, this tiny restaurant was already crowded. I was alone so it didn't take that long to get a seat. I had some sashimi along with nigiri sushi - delicious, loved the light wasabi flavor among every bite of nigiri sushi. Tuna tartare was good as well, but I actually expected more ;) What I liked the most, were their Ikura sushi, which is salmon roe topped on sushi rice, they turned out to be really flavorful as the salmon eggs were well seasoned.  Japango is definitely a decent sushi bar, give it a try."}
{"text":"The place is pretty small, almost squished. I ordered the 3 rolls and tempura veggies. I thought I would get more for portion sizes, considering the rolls were $21. They gave me a spider roll, and salmon roll, and a California roll with red tobiko. The rolls had 6 pieces each and were smallish. I think the waitress for another table seemed stressed out. She seemed to slam my friend's drink when she set it on our table.  But my actual waiter was really friendly and casual. The bathroom is also tiny, but at least there is one. I feel as if I should have ordered the nigiri to comment more on the sushi's freshness. I thought it was delicious, but I wouldn't say the best I've ever had. It is a good place to eat at if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible value for you money. Portion sizes are extremely small for the sushi, 8 dollars + for 6 tiny pieces that literally are finished in 2 minutes. I normally go to the beaches location and the prices are very reasonable and you get an adequate amount of food for your money, I will definitely not return as it will end up costing you around 60 dollars to actually be full. Not realistic pricing for sushi .... not to mention it's tiny inside the place and very rushed atmosphere. Stick to the location in the beaches, you'll enjoy it more!"}
{"text":"A nice little spot tucked away off of Dundas with fresh sushi (albeit not cheap!). Make sure to call ahead to book a reservation as it's often difficult to get a spot on a Friday or Saturday night without one! I'd recommend the dragon roll."}
{"text":"The sushi here is delicious! I definitely plan to return for more. Though a touch small, the atmosphere is also very authentic and enjoyable. The service, though, left a lot to be desired. Though I did go here during a weekday lunch hour, I did have a two person reservation and I would have excepted better. Our waitress rushed us (even though I had stated it was our first time there), ran off before we completed our orders, didn't return when we signalled her, barely let us add to/alter our orders, and was just plain unpleasant. I wish now that I had gotten her name."}
{"text":"Very small space so make a reservation! The fastest service we have ever received! The japanago roll was incredible!! We also got the California roll, seaweed salad, and sake and we were not disappointed!!"}
{"text":"- call me a pseudo-purist, but the fact that the waitstaff and chefs being korean turned me a little off. mind you, they could've been koreans who lived in japan... - had the moriawase (chef's choice) sushi and sashimi and it was very well done. didn't think i'd be full afterwards. but... i was! very fresh and very tasty.  - no joke. it's small like everyone calls out. make a reservation. even on monday nights. - being a bit of sushi snob having lived in japan. this place is pretty decent, by toronto standards :) - fyi - they do take-out."}
{"text":":Bay + Dundas:         It's not impossible to find good sushi in Toronto.  You just have to know where  to look.   Sure, all signs point to Guu...for now...but I hope you like waiting...an hour.  Or, you can make a reservation and head down to Japango.  Be seated, and eat.  It's tiny.  It's hidden.  It's yummy.     The narrow space only holds about 20 or so people, and it's almost always filled to capacity.  Last night was my third trip to Japango and it was special.  The presentation was beautiful and the food was delicious.  The sushi is always fresh and clean, and prices are reasonable - it's no New Gen or Sushi Inn (thank goodness), and the few extra dollars is a small price to pay for some of the best sushi in downtown Toronto.    My favourite is their Japango roll.  It's s-e-r-i-o-u-s.       The Japango Roll.  Heavenly bites.    Japangofans everywhere come often and eat happy."}
{"text":"Got take out from this place for lunch once and it was OKAY. Second time I walked in with my boyfriend during dinner time unaware that a reservation is needed. The owner just said \"reservation?\" We said no and he just turned and walked away. Extremely rude. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Good sushi, really liked all my usual fare (spicy tuna hand roll, spicy salman maki). Tried octopus sushi on waiter's reco and really liked it as well (never had it before). Everything was  melt-in-your-mouth fresh. Prices were pretty okay. Only negative was lack of privacy and elbow room as the place is TINY and always full. But will I come back for a quick sushi fix? YES!"}
{"text":"Honestly kind of disappointed by this place due to its overwhelmingly positive reviews; with my experience it was just really \"meh.\" I ordered the Tempura Udon which I think was alright but was nothing out of the ordinary. Tempura batter was very standard, maybe even too thick, and  the soup base tastes very similar to store bought ones. In addition the tempura was served in the bowl of udon, and though it looked very pretty and appetizing, it didn't take long before the tempura batter began to soak up the soup, making it an unpleasant texture to eat. I would actually have preferred it if they served the tempura on the side which would preserve it's crispiness. It also came with a salad which, in my opinion was horrendous. It was drenched in this miso dressing, which I typically am I fan of in other restaurants, but this one was so over loaded with ginger it was just unbearable! To add to tha,t it was served in this modern looking bowl in hopes of winning presentation points, but what that did was make it extremely difficult for me to spread the dressing around and minimize the horrific attack of ginger in my mouth. Now I understand that most compliments here are based on their sushi, so maybe that is there only forte, in which case i think they should just specialize in that one thing then rather than calling themselves a sushi AND noodle restaurant.  Overall, I think that Japango should look beyond the need to offer excellent presentation, but also focus on food quality as well. For the price of their food, customer service, and food quality, I think I would probably choose from many other Japanese places I've been to and will unlikely return. They weren't bad, but not good enough for that price.  PS. someone mentioned this was authentic Japanese, but I'm not too sure about the degree of authenticity since the two sushi chefs spoke to each other in Korean, (although there was one waitress who only stayed in the kitchen that spoke Japanese) and typical Japanese welcomes and overall customer service was amiss."}
{"text":"I used to go here frequently, but their customer service has become frustrating.  They have a policy of not telling potential customers how long the wait might be until everyone is there, which is incredibly annoying as a customer trying to decide what to do."}
{"text":"Bomb sushi. Best in Toronto. Very very small like 7 tables, MAKE A RESERVATION  or you wait 30 minutes or they will even turn you away. Go hungry get the japango special roll. And enjoy the night!"}
{"text":"If you want sushi that taste close to what they serve in Japan, Japango is the place for you. The only place I trust in Toronto that serves quality sushi. I really recommend this place and if you're going for the first time, I recommend ordering the Chirashi supreme. My only complain about this place is that the restaurant is too small and feels congested. I'd hope that they expand one day and get a place that can accommodate more guest. I still would give this place a 5 star, since it's the only place I know in Toronto so far that serves sushi that taste similar to the fresh sushi they serve in Japan."}
{"text":"I prefer Yuzu.   The deluxe sashimi combo comes with more fish. Also this place is a lot smaller.  Taste/ quality wise, I'd say that this place is on par with Yuzu"}
{"text":"Sashimi was amazing! The cuts of fish are meaty and super fresh, and you get a nice variety in one sitting. At a fair price of $18 (comes with rice and miso soup) I would say it was definitely worth it. Service was good and efficient, ambience was intimate but a tad small. Only downside is the wait, due to there being only 5/6 tables--and it's this long wait that has perhaps set my expectations for Japango too high...and unfortunately, can't say I am willing to give away 5 stars just yet. However, will definitely come back to try  other dishes to see if they are worth giving that last star!"}
{"text":"I'll make this review as short and sweet as possible to go along with the rest of my overtime take out meal series.  Japango, what can I say, there's a fair bit of hype associated with this place.  First off their sushi always looks fresh and I have had a few of my friends tell me this place has some of the best donkatsu in downtown TO.  I figured hell yeah, I'm going to order a donkatsu dinner to highlight my evening at work!  First off when I received my meal, none of the items in my combo were labeled.  Simply bagging all the items in one bag together and writing the name of the person can't be that hard right?  So after 15 minutes of sorting through other people's meals, salads and soups I finally put together my donkatsu combo.  I started with the salad first, and what a mistake the lettuce was totally spoiled!  Not sure if it was due to the fact it was put beside hot food, but I had to throw it out because it was so gue-like.  Now on to the miso soup, I should call it me no soup, because it tasted like water with sand in it.  Finally the creme de la creme the donkatsu...when I opened the box it looked as if a small child had vomited all over my Styrofoam box.  Not only was the pork not crispy, it was totally wet and the sauces kind of just soaked into the box and rice making a non pleasant chunk of food.  I mean it was take out and I should be a bit more forgiving, so I'm dropping a 2 star instead of a 1.  I might give them another shot, but will be definitely ordering sushi next time.  Please label my boxes next time Japango or I'll have to JapanNo on my next order!"}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurants are the tiny ones. This place was fixed with 6 intimate tables. But it was not stuffy or loud to have conversations. After having a sip of the tea, I couldn't have a sapporo. It was that good. Probably because it was cold outside. Either way the tea is good. I had the hamachi kama (yellow tail tuna collar). It was perfectly grilled and was tender. Probably the best app to have.  As an entree I had the Sushi Sashimi Moriawase. What better way to try a restaurant for the first time than with chef's choice. It was nothing but perfect. I would have gone with the Omikaze; but I wasn't that hungry due to the hamachi Kama. I will certainly eat here again when back in Toronto."}
{"text":"I like the place I really do, but it's insanely small. Like, what on earth - it's crazy cramped! I broke a dish just trying to get into the inside spot on the bench because the tables were so snug.   I would've been willing to go for the omakase if I went for a dinner, but when we tried it was crazy full at 630pm with no chance of getting a seat since they were full up with reservations. On a Thursday. Clearly this place has a loyal following for being so full on a random weekday.   The fish is good - the fatty tuna, slightly seared with a garlic glaze was delicious. The salmon was definitely lacking in flavour, and the tuna only slightly better. The japango roll was heavenly - it came with the right amount of fish and flavour, a good size to fit it all in one bite, and a happy combination of textures (crunchy, soft, chewy, and the unique \"bouncy\" texture that Chinese people have a word for but I can't seem to find an equivalent in the English language).   Overall it's a solid place - it's been around in tdot for a super long time and it's clear why. I'll be super excited to revisit when they move up to a bigger location!"}
{"text":"We went there around 5pm which is not a typical dinner peak hour; however, the restaurant was pretty full. And that's probably why they have our orders came up at a different time. My boyfriend had to watch me finishing since his plate was already served with appetizer like 10 minutes ago. And I don't see how unagi rice could be prepared just in 3 minutes after we placed the order. Anyways, the fish were really fresh; seasonings were good. They did a good job but not too impressive."}
{"text":"this place made me think that i had never had sushi before. the restaurant is small but the sushi is out of this world. so tasty and fresh. if you're a sushi lover you must try this place."}
{"text":"Great food - very fresh fish (maybe one of the freshest in Toronto) and a lot of delicacies.  I have been to Japango on numerous occasions - both for dinner and lunch. It is an excellent place to drop by for a quick lunch or a nice casual, authentic meal. The clientele is predominately, yuppies.   My favourite are the chirashi sushi and  Japango maki - the sauce has bite! I also try to order the chef's special, which changes daily according to the catch of the day.. The baby green salad is also very good - it accompanies the set dinners (I hate iceberg lettuce).   The only drawback in my opinion is that it is extremely tiny and you will be squished next  to your neighbour.  If you are ok with this, and love great, authentic Japanese food, definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The best thing about this sushi spot is that it's convenient you can find many locations dT. And the pricing is super fair. It is basically the McDonalds of sushi."}
{"text":"This is a nice cozy little place. It probably have seating for 15 people? We came here after an event. This was one of the few places that's still open. Lucky it was late night or else I do not think we would get a seat.   The noodle dishes looked spledid. I should have ordered those but I stupidly ordered what I usually order at sushi places, a combo of different sushis. Don't get me wrong, it was good and I got to try my friend's noodles. Next time I come back I'm going to order the noodles. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been to Japango twice and originally went because of the great reviews here. Definitely make a reservation because the seating is limited. The food is fantastic! It's fresh and flavourful. I will definitely come again. I recommend the scallop appetizer and tuna tartar."}
{"text":"I ordered soft shelf crab, oyster ponzu, deluxe sushi dinner and regular sashimi dinner. The soft shelf crab was pretty good, but it was a bit too oily for me. The oyster ponzu was a must try. The oysters were very fresh and delicious. The sushi and sashimi dinner sets were good, but they were not amazing. For this price range, I would prefer jabistro more because the quality of food is better. (Yasu is still my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto, but it is more expensive comparing to japango and jabistro.)   Food: 6/10 . Food was not amazingly good and the green tea tasted a bit weird.  Environment: 3/10 The restaurant is so small and the table couldn't even fit the food that I ordered. Service: 7/10"}
{"text":"First time had Chirashi. Their sashimi were so fresh that could just melt in your mouth. The rice was seasoned, came with marinated mushrooms (I guess). Taste of simplicity. Loved it.  The Japango roll and assorted rolls were yum too, fresh and delicious.  The place is however so tiny. We sat at the corner the table that was not stable. Other than that it was a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Came back a couple times for lunch and take out (started a new job downtown recently so I've been coming a little too often).  Came here for a Chirashi Supreme ($28) for take out, a chirashi dinner ($21) for take out,  And sat down for a tempura udon and uni sushi, all on separate occasions.  Chirashi supreme included Uni, which was very fresh. The Chirashi supreme was nice and huge--very filling. The chirashi dinner did not include Uni, but included yellowtail and some torched pieces of butterfish. It was also very huge and filling.  Yutaka is right around the corner, and I tried their Chef's chirashi, which was also $28. Yutaka included 2 pieces of otoro and 2 pieces of chutoro. Ahh, it's so hard to decide who wins.. so I'm going to give them a tie for now.  Japango's tempura udon was excellent. I'm not an udon expert, but their udon broth and udon quality were maybe the best I've had. The shrimp tempura were also pretty huge. I enjoyed the udon here a bit more than the udon at Yutaka.  The lady server there started to recognize me after going there a few days in a row for takeout lunch. Very nice and friendly lady!  I'm probably going to come back a lot more often.  My previous review still stands. 9.25/10 for the quality. 9/10 for the service. 9/10 for the value. 9/10 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"Heard this place was pretty good so I dropped by for quick bite. The location was super small with only about 10 tables. To make things brief, the sushi was pretty fresh but the location and food as a whole was definitely overrated. The Japango roll was way too spicy and the serving sizes were tremendously small compared to the price point. In my opinion, there are far better options for the amount you are paying in the area."}
{"text":"This place serves some of the best sushi I've ever tasted. You can literally see and taste the difference immediately. I ordered 3 rolls, and vegetable tempura. The rolls were nicely wrapped and the rice was sticky, but not mooshy and the flavour was divine. The tempura was crisp on the outside, but soft and warm on the inside.    The venue itself is tiny and there are only about 8 tables. They also had about 7 ppl working, so it's tight in there, but service is quick and efficient. We had our food in under 10 minutes."}
{"text":"The seafood here is super fresh! I always get the sea urchin sushi here. It's a small restaurant so at popular times a reservation is needed. The prices are reasonable and the waiter is attentive."}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 7/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 7/10  Okay, so this is one of those untouchable mystical sushi restaurants of Toronto, so maybe expectations played into this a little. Everyone kept saying the sashimi was great, but that wasn't the case with our order. The sashimi was...average? Dare I say I couldn't tell the difference between Japango's sashimi and any other Japanese all-you-can-eat restaurant? Comparing the two, what set Japango apart was their superior presentation.  -- Japango Roll ($13) - It looked really ordinary, but this was my favourite part of the meal. It looks really ordinary with a torched salmon top and avocado and scallop (?) inside, but it was delicious. This roll, along with the uni sashimi, came to our table literally less than a minute after we ordered it. It was shockingly fast.   -- Spider Roll ($11) - This was also delicious. The two rolls were the clear standouts of the dinner. Much smaller than the spider rolls I've had at other restaurants and a very different taste; more delicate, refined, less batter.   -- Uni Sashimi ($9 for three pieces) - I finally experienced the \"melt in your mouth\" sensation people attribute to uni. And without the fart-like aftertaste too!   -- Sushi and Sashimi Moriwase Platter ($50) - This was really underwhelming. With only 18 pieces, it was so expensive, but a good portion of these had a fishy or kinda-fishy taste to it. The presentation was really nice, but it didn't really taste very special.  -- Sushi Deluxe ($30) - 12 pieces with a bonus Dynamite Roll. At this point, we were ordering more food because we weren't full and we also wanted to give their highly-spoken-of sushi another chance. Because the value of the Dynamite Roll is $9, that means the 12 pieces of sushi were $21, which would be relatively reasonable for Japango. However, food is about taste first and this, just like the Moriwase Platter, was fine, but not exciting or exceptional.   I don't like how cramped the restaurant is. It's uncomfortably small, like you're banging into everything trying to squeeze into your spot. I honestly don't know how this place operates in the winter because every time someone came in, it brought all the cold night air into the restaurant and blew directly on my back. Fortunately, it wasn't that cold that day, but I'm genuinely curious how anyone would be able to eat comfortably here in the winter.   The service is really quick. You don't get more tea unless you ask for it and because there's only one waiter and he's trying to be as efficient as possible, he can come across as unintentionally rude, like walking away in the middle of your order because he's trying to give another table their order. Just something to keep in mind so that you don't take it personally if it happens to you.  The bill ended up being $50/person and my friends said they'd rather spend the $50 at JaBistro."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly but nothing exceptional about the service. They don't ask before taking your food away from the table. The sashimi was fresh and yummy. Standard pricing for a sushi restaurant. Lunch specials range from $11 to $20. A significant downside of the restaurant is that the space is very cramped - they only have about seven tables (for two people) so serving a larger group might be an issue."}
{"text":"This was the fanciest sushi experience I've had, as well as the smallest sushi bar I have ever sat in. This dichotomic combination is what makes the meal so entirely surprising because despite it's minimal space capacity, the sushi chefs were still able to deliver a sushi dish comparable to the elite upper tiers of new york restaurants.   I ordered the sashimi dinner and the presentation was aesthetically crafted with a variety of unique garnishing. This was the first time I have seen uni (sea urchin roe) served in a sashimi dinner combo. The taste of the uni was very appetizing to me personally but it was definitely an experience. There was a variety of other foreign fish on the plate.   Overall, a very great experience. Minus 1 star only because the variety was so unique that it was a little too foreign for what I was used to."}
{"text":"Cool little small Japanese restaurant in the downtown area.  Tried some udon and it was pretty good made with fresh veggies and some chicken and it was very tasty.  Funny thing is as we were finishing up, the chef comes out with a massive dish of udon, and it looked much better than ours...LOL  It was actually lunch for the staff...I told them, next time I want that!!    Sushi is excellent but rolls and pieces are small.  But overall very good.  Very small restaurant with limited seating, but worth a try."}
{"text":"The sashimi was not very fresh. My friend had stomachache after our lunch. Food quality and taste were not very impressive.  Overall the restaurant is very small and you need reservation in order to avoid lineup. Price is very reasonable.   P.s. the owner is Korean instead of Japanese."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I do not agree with the reviews of other yelpers!! There is no way this place is authentic! We got the deluxe sushi dinner and tonkatsu dinner. The sushi were all soft as if it was heavily marinated in some kind of meat softener. They also put fried garlic in the sushi which prevented me from tasting the fish! (maybe that was their plan all along?) finally, they made those fake flamed sushi where they lightly Burned the fish! As far as I know, sushi is meant to be eatten raw! The only time you find these burnt sushi is at non-authentic places!!!!!  As for the tonkatsu, the meat was dry and tasteless, and most importantly, they used some sort of rice that had too much water, and it wasn't Japanese rice!!! I am chinese, and the rice should be more suited for Chinese food, but definitely not suitable for japanese food!!!"}
{"text":"Who says Japango isn't for kids? We just spent a wonderful 2 hours there with a 5 year old and 7 month old  and a reservation for 6 people at 6pm. Even though they barely have enough space to squeeze back and forth from the kitchen and don't have a change table in the bathrooms don't knock them off your short list due to these factors. The staff were more than accommodating and even offered to heat up baby food for us. Japango size wise is the culinary version of the Japanese Compact Car but when it comes to the quality of the food it is more like a Lexus than Toyota. We all had the Chef special deluxe with a side of Spider Roll, Rainbow Roll, Spicy Salmon Crunch and Tempura Udon.   Don't bother showing up without a reservation, they turned away at least 20 people while we were there.  I havent had sushi this good in Toronto for a while. They must have it Fed Exed in from wherever the good stuff comes from. Just ask for what's fresh, and when it came in, and stick it in your mouth.  If you are a regular you can bring your own chopsticks and keep them there. However don't feel you aren't special if you decide to eat with the table bamboo.  if you have kids that can stay put bring em, and if they are restless and wan't to try and run around don't worry. They only cook kids in chinatown."}
{"text":"One of the good sushi spot! It's a small place so makesure you make reservation before you go. We had their sushi rolls and the one we liked the best was the Japango Roll! The spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls were really good too; they were pretty spicy so be careful before you order. A lot of people like the sashimi there as well. Definitely a good sushi spot in Toronto! Would recommend going forsure!"}
{"text":"We went as a group of five and had to wait more than half an hour for our table even though we had a reservation, not the best start. This place is very small, so it works well for couples but not so much for groups. The food is quite good. Each of the appetizers, sashimi, sushi and maki were expertly prepared and beautifully plated. The quality of the ingredients is also very high, which one would expect at this price point. The reason I give it only 3 stars is the price - even by downtown Toronto standards, the dishes are overpriced. At $50 per person without alcohol I should be able to do more than sample sushi on uncomfortable seats. Also - pet peeve alert! - they include an automatic gratuity for groups of 5 or more. Not a deal-breaker, but not classy either. We had a pretty good meal, but none of us would recommend this place or will return because the value is just not there. I don't mind spending, but there are plenty of equivalent sushi establishments in Toronto at much more favourable prices."}
{"text":"this place is ok, not bad, good quality but way too small, too cramped, more staff than necessary and not worth the wait sometimes since there are a lot of options in the neighbourhood for asian food in general"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here.  The sushi was high quality and tasted fresh. The highlight of the meal was the Japango roll (their signature roll) and the Bluefin tuna belly sashimi. The Japango roll has cooked salmon, scallop, and fish roe on top of a California roll. The spicy mayo sauce had a nice kick to it, not an over powering spiciness. This is definitely a must try when coming to visit here. The bluefin tuna belly sashimi, melts in your mouth, it was soft and buttery. If you love sashimi, I would definitely recommend this. It is expensive, but so worth it. The fish even came with gold leaf flecks! It was delicious! All the food here not only looked pretty, but tasted great. The sushi rice was cooked perfectly, and had a great flavour too it. From the way the food was presented and the knife can tell that good technique was used.   We ordered the sushi sashimi moriawase dinner. This is the chef's selection of sushi and sashimi.The Hamachi sashimi was another one of my favourites. I enjoyed the different of fish that was showcased. The meal comes with a miso soup, which was a bit too salty for me. It also comes with the typical salad. I enjoyed the ginger salad dressing. In addition, the dinner includes clams in a broth. The clams were cooked perfectly, and the broth had a great clam taste to it.  We also ordered the yellow tail and tuna rolls, which were yummy as well.  I recommend making a reservation if you can. It's tiny and get full fast."}
{"text":"Good selection of sushi and they have some harder to find in Toronto, like otoro and anago. However, the store is extremely cramped when it is full. If you are planning to come for dinner on thr weekend, make sure to call ahead and make a reservation, but they tend to have a full house. Overall, the good selection of fish will keep me coming back, just not on weekends."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and I'm so glad I did.  This place is absolutely amazing.  We sat down at 5:45pm (early dinner) and only had about 30 minutes to eat.  The server was incredibly nice and was having the sushi bar make our sushi AS we were ordering.  Everything was delicious- we had the king salmon (best salmon sashimi I've ever had) the specialty toro and several other cuts of sashimi.  I absolutely loved the Japango roll, what's inside it?  Magic.  Literally.  Order it and find out for yourself."}
{"text":"Food is just OK. To expensive..."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Toronto has the highest concentration of Japanese restaurants outside of Japan. Seriously, I think there's one on practically every block. We stopped by this place, and apparently got lucky. Didn't have to wait for a table for two, but just after us they started turning people away as they were full from reservations. This place is TINY. I think there might be enough space for maybe twenty people to eat (rather cramped), but it's worth it.   We ordered the chicken teriyaki and the assorted rolls (three rolls for $17). The chicken was all white meat and the standard teriyaki sauce was accompanied by some herbs which gave it a nice flavor. The rolls were freshly made and the fish was definitely fresh. We had a California roll, salmon roll, and tempura roll. The salmon roll turned out to be my favorite probably due to the great quality of the fish.   Highly recommended, but make a reservation. Wish I lived here, I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the tiniest places to get sushi but well worth te cramped space.  In fact, it gives it much more character. Reasonable prices for fish that is guaranteed to be fresh. The service is so so so very friendly but English communication can be a challenge at times if you have a question about the menu.  Try not to go in a group of more than 4- you simply just won't fit!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Toronto!! Rolls are amazing and the fish is very fresh. Only downside is the place is very small so reservations is a must."}
{"text":"This place is easily one of my favourite sushi places in all of Toronto. After going to Japan last year, it's hard to find another place on this side of the globe that's nearly as good, but Japango comes close. The restaurant is a pretty small place with not many tables and definitely not much wiggle room, but that's just like how they do it in Japan right - hole in the wall style.   My favourite thing to order here are without a doubt the fried soft shell crab, Japango roll, sashimi platter and chirashi. The Japango roll is quite something and it's way better than other restaurants (eg. Wow Sushi) that try to replicate it. Their sashimi is always fresh and come in thick slices. During my busy season at work, I had their chirashi take out almost once a week. For just over $20, it comes with enough fish to make you more than full.  I also forgot to upload the pictures so they'll show up separately in pictures instead. Oops!"}
{"text":"I think at this point, I've had my fair share of higher quality sushi restaurants in Toronto and so, I can only give Japango an \"A-OK\" at best.   I'll start with 2 things that I really liked: 1) They offer shima aji, which only a very few number of restaurants in Toronto offer (the other place where I found it was at Yasu)  2) Their signature Japango roll was delicious - a bit spicy but the overall flavours and textures were really nicely paired. I mean, it was seared scallop and salmon after all.. yum!  3) They sprinkle little gold flakes on a few of the sashimi offerings and despite how extra it actually is since you can't taste it, it does make me feel really fancy haha  Now onto the cons, note that none of these points were detrimental but I just have a lot more room for criticism since I've been to its competitors (Jabistro, Yasu, Miku, Kingyo, etc.): 1) No reservation? No seat. This tiny little restaurant is tucked away on Elizabeth street and can probably only seat 15-20 people maximum.  2) There's little to no space to stand while waiting for a seat, and the employees clearly struggle with having to dodge one another to walk to/from the kitchen. 3) Food/cutlery/dishes/hot drinks are rudely \"dropped off\" over-your-head and onto the table because of the lack of space between tables 4) My boyfriend and I each ordered a sushi sashimi moriawase (which is essentially chef's choice) and we received no explanation of which fish was what when it was delivered to us (this was fairly important to me because I wanted to be able to identify which ones I liked as well as to have a gauge for comparing with other restaurants)  6) While they do offer higher quality sashimi (as they should considering their price point..!), I wouldn't say that it's the best that I've had in Toronto - nothing was \"outstandingly special\" 7) We ordered the \"scallop on the half shell\" and we probably wouldn't get it again. The flavour was quite nice and the mushrooms were juicy but the scallops were a bit dry/tough on the edges.   Overall, I'm not sure I would recommend this place just because it's fairly expensive and I feel that you could walk away with a better experience elsewhere (though you would probably be fuller from this one). If I'm looking to go \"all out\" for the best of the best quality, I wouldn't pick this place."}
{"text":"My five stars Japanese restaurant. Friendly customer service, fresh food. Little pricey but I think it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here during lunch time and got the chicken bento box which was one of the cheapest things on the menu $10 before tax and tips. I found that the teriyaki chicken was absolutely delicious and there were many sides. However, the sides weren't that large and it was not filling. I would say that japango definitely strives towards quality rather than quantity and I have seen other restaurants that try to increase their quantity but compromise their quality. The food here was delicious but not as filling. The servers were attentive and checked up on me a lot, cleaning and removing used dishes and paper. I would return to try their other things!"}
{"text":"Out of the meager selection of good sushi in Toronto, this is one of the decent places. However, they charge so much, that it makes it not worth going here at all. $26 for a chirashi? This absolutely unacceptable. The place is tiny, uncomfortable and has no design. The staff doesn't even attempt to compensate for the skyrocketing prices. Very rude! They don't even acknowledge you when you come in!"}
{"text":"The food was good, not great, but for the price, I can think of several restaurants nearby that I would rather go to.  Regardless, it was hard to appreciate the food with the incredibly rude customer service we experienced.  When we first arrived, my friend and I were waiting on a third and were told that everyone needed to be present before we could be seated.  We decided to sit in the chairs in front of the door while we waited, but several minutes later, we were told rather rudely that we would have to wait at a neighbouring restaurant's lobby because of \"fire hazards\" even though we weren't blocking anybody.  Why even have those chairs there if no one is allowed to use them?  Throughout the meal we felt rushed to finish our food and vacate our table because the place is TINY (I was literally knocking knees with the man beside me).  We couldn't even have a conversation without the waiter asking us if we were done/needed anything else several times.  As soon as we finished our food, the plates were whisked away and the bill was promptly placed on our table, even though there wasn't a single person waiting for a table.  Definitely not a worthwhile visit."}
{"text":"Finally found a decent sushi place after moving to Toronto from Vancouver, a.k.a. sushi heaven. A bit overpriced, but good quality with lots of \"freebies\" on the house. Table seating can be uncomfortably close."}
{"text":"Overpriced, squishy, and dirty placemats.  I had this restaurant on the list of places I wanted to try, so I was super excited to have the chance to go spontaneously on a Thursday with my BFF! I was lucky enough to call about an hour ahead to make a reservation at 7:45pm. They had a spot available so we went.  When we got there, I noticed the tiny restaurant space right away. It's a little uncomfortable, especially with heavy winter jackets. We got the corner table by the window. Only one of us was able to take off our jackets.  My BFF found the green tea not hot enough. It could be classified as lukewarm at most. Even after refilling, it was warm.  The dinner menu is quite pricey. Lunch looked reasonable, though. As we flipped through the menus, we noticed that the placemats underneath were sticky as if they hadn't been wiped all night.   We both opted to get the $21 chirashi don. It came with a miso soup and salad. The miso soup was average. The salad was drenched in ginger dressing, giving it a very strong ginger taste. We were starving though, so we inhaled both very quickly.  The chirashi don was quite nice looking. I found that they did not give an excessive amount of sushi rice to accompany the fish on top. I had the perfect amount. The sashimi slices were a bit on the thinner side, though. I found the fish quality to be average. And in general, the portion was not very big. We both had room for bubble tea afterwards.  The bill was quite expensive at the end, for the portion and the dining experience. The seats are so cramped! And service was very meh. I really did not see why everyone raved about this place, unfortunately.  This place has nothing on most sushi places in Vancouver, but if I had to have good, expensive, Japanese food here, I would go to Cafe Michi instead. Oh well, despite the disappointing experience, I got to check one place off my list!"}
{"text":"Decent food.  Horrid service that pushes customers out like a sweat shop.  Is the food worth the poor service? Nope."}
{"text":"We found this place due to reviews we read along with the fact we were in the mood for sushi.  What we did not know was how small this restaurant is.  Thank goodness it was a little later in the evening so we did not have to wait for a table very long.  We ordered various sushi and rolls.  Everything we had was fresh and tasty.  We also had some good sake with our dinner."}
{"text":"Like this place needs more good reviews. Everything is fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is cozy. I wish it were a tiny bit bigger, though, because I'm too intimidated to come in on a Saturday night (the waits are probably insane). The staff are really friendly, and sometimes give out complimentary dishes to the patrons, which is really sweet and thoughtful--also forces you to try something new.  I strongly recommend the sashimi plate, tuna belly (the presentation is fantastic), and fried ebi head. We usually get a bit of everything, but these are the only things I can come up with on the spot. I don't think you can go wrong at Japango. Order whatever you like."}
{"text":"Hidden nearby the busy intersection of yonge and Dundas, Japan go is a tiny cozy busy little restaurant that , from the outside, doesn't look like much.   Inside, however , is always busy every time I dine in. Waiting time would be about 15 minutes approximately. My partner and I sat at the table for two at the very end of the restaurant beside the kitchen doorway.  There seems to be one server that works there that who I've noticed serves the entire tiny restaurant and does so very efficiently and attentively. The menu is simple, but I always order the japango sushi roll - the sashimi on top and their house made sauce compliments each other well.  My partner and I had the chefs selection, so that consisted of a couple dishes of the chefs choice which was not only delicious but the aesthetic of the dishes were beautifully plated - I did not want to eat it! The server gave us a little green root and shredder , I had no idea it was wasabi that we were to shred for ourselves- it was pretty awesome and neat! Fresh wasabi was not as spicy as I had imagined.   Overall, food and service is great - I rate that a 5 One thing that made this restaurant a 4 star rating is that the seating is SO tiny and I do not feel comfortable squeezing my ass through mine and the table next to ours every time I need to get up! ( I'm a size 25 in jeans if that tells you anything)  The seating is a little too snug for my liking, especially during the winter with everyone's outerwear. the seating is the only issue that bothers me. Other than that, I would recommend Japan Go!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I ever had. Everything is kind of pricy but during lunch time, it is really good deal. But the space is very small. Be prepared for some waiting."}
{"text":"I love how small this place is and how it gives a Japanese feel to it. Very small but this is what makes the place interesting and unique.  Great sushi. Very fresh. I think we ordered their signature plate and it was really refreshing. Not too heavy. Everything they have on the sushi were fresh.   The sashimis are also very delicious and fresh. Love love their sashimis. It's one od the best I've had.  The servers are very friendly. Just hard to understand sometimes because of their accents, but they are very customer oriented.   The sushi are made fresh right in front of your eyes. The sushi chefs are located right in the corner of the place and you can easily see how they make the sushi.   The only thing is that it is pretty pricey...but having something this fresh is definitely worth it. It's not the type of sushi for an all you can eat. The chefs roll it so delicately and beautifully and you can tell the quality of what you get on your plate. It is aesthetically very pleasing.    Great experience. Love the place. Love the sushi and sashimi!"}
{"text":"Japango has one of the freshest sushi in town for a great price! This small establishment off of Dundas is easy to miss. Due to its size, we always make a reservation ahead of time.  We usually get the agadashi tofu to start. The broth with it makes it taste amazing. Our favourite rolls are the Alaska roll and signature Japango roll. We love the torched sushi of the Alaska roll, as well as its sauce. We also order the tempura udon soup which the broth is very flavourful. Another favourite is the chirachi. The rice is nice and soft. The sashimi is chef's choice and always fresh.   You can't go wrong with anything on their menu!"}
{"text":"Cute little Japanese restaurant close to Bay and Dundas. It is another hidden gem in downtown toronto. Only sits about 12 people so definitely make reservations if you can!  Been here many times and their japango roll is to die for. Their sashimi is also super fresh and very good quality. Prices are fair for what you are getting. If you come by at lunch they have lunch specials that are cheaper but the same quantity as a dinner menu!  Staff are super friendly and there are always specials every night! Live Uni is also available at this location. Definitely a little pricier than average sushi place, but the quality of sushi and sashimi at this place is amazing."}
{"text":"The perfect spot for quick service and good sushi near the finance district. My friend and I visited just past noon on a Tuesday and had to be back at the office for a meeting at 1. We were served promptly, the food came quickly and we got our sushi fix all in 40 minutes!   We each ordered a miso soup and shared the gyoza, both were tasty. We also shared the Japango and the spider roll. I will order the Japango roll every time I visit because it is fantastic. The combination of flavours and ingredients is spot on. The spider roll I could do without, 4 rolls had crab and the remaining 2 were merely avocado rolls. I also ordered the salmon sashimi which was very fresh and came in thick pieces.  In total the bill came to $60. Not the cheapest sushi place, but the speed of service at lunch time is unbeatable and it's the best quality sushi in the area. Try your best to arrive before noon as it's a small place; we got very lucky to score a table!"}
{"text":"I don't know how is the food here but the service is terrible we have three people and two have already there,there are two all set tables with four chairs each. The waiter ask me and my bf wait OutSide until my friend come.I asked him if I can sit on the waiting chair and my boyfriend is outside but he refused.Your restaurant was not full at all and there are waiting chairs inside.I don't mind wait but why all of us need wait OUTSIDE if so you should remove those waiting chairs to give your restaurant more space. Will not come here again for sure!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out because it was the highest ranked \"sushi\" search result in Yelp in that area. I was very surprised at how small it was inside and I did feel part of an \"in\" crowd as I've never heard of this place before and looked exclusive!  Anyways, we went in and got a seat immediately (at 8 on a weeknight), a line up quickly followed and we were definitely felt lucky we got there when we did.  I was expecting a little more before the food came out in terms of the miso soup and salad. They were both good but didn't meet the high expectations I had which I thought were going to be deflated as the meal went on.  Then came our sushi pizza and I loved it, even more because it did not contain any mayo or cheese sauce which I absolutely hate in sushi pizzas.  We then ordered the \"Deluxe Sushi Dinner\" which came with 10 assorted pieces of sushi and 8 pieces of rolls. The fish tasted very fresh and definitely were a thicker cut than what you would get at most other places for the similar price range. Yummy green tea ice cream followed and it was a great way to end the meal.   The atmosphere was fantastic, and I grew to love the tightness of the space, our neighbours (from out of towners) made friends with their neighbours and I attribute that to the closeness felt inside. Everyone seemed like very nice and friendly and this included the staff as well!   All in all, a great find and I credit Yelp and all the past reviewers for guiding me there. I will most definitely be visiting there more often (but like Angela I do secretly/selfishly hope not too many people discover this place).   Nerd Alert: The actors playing \"Haldir\" and Grima\" from the Lord of the Rings trilogy also seemed to have dinned their since there autographed pictures of them with notes of thanks to the restaurant. There were other frames up, but I could not see of whom they were. That definitely put this place very high up on my list of cool places in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"I love their Udon! The broth and toppings are just impeccable! There's plenty of good ramen places downtown but a good bowl of udon is hard to find. I would recommend the Nabeyaki Udon but beware that it's topped off well so you'll get full fast. I've yet to try their sushi but my friends always love them."}
{"text":"The Chirashi was amazing! It was packed to the brim with lots of fresh sashimi of different types and a layer of warm sushi rice on the bottom. I really enjoyed this! Eating this, I could tell why people rave about Japango. The sashimi was all so fresh! In particular, the salmon sashimi was cut in thick slices and was very soft and delicious. The rest of the sashimi -- tuna, scallop, tamago -- were all in large pieces too and tasted very good. The sushi rice, while sounding normal, was actually incredibly delicious and seasoned so well. I loved it! The Chirashi was a large portion and definitely worth the $21.  Here comes the disappointing and ridiculous part: As I mentioned, we were initially seated at around 5:35 p.m. (the timestamp on my photos show this). By 6:25 p.m., not even an hour into the dinner, the owner came over and asked us if we wanted our bills paid separately or together. We answered for the bills to be paid separately and then he brought the bills over and put them on our table. At this point, Holly and Joyce had finished their food already but I was still in the middle of my meal -- I had a quarter of my food left to go. Again, I have to stress that it was not even an hour into our total time dining in when he came over and said we had to pay right away because there were reservations for other customers coming in that needed our table. Um, WTF. I wasn't even done eating my food! Being the quiet person that I am and not liking to make a big fuss out of things in public, I hurriedly gobbled down the rest of the sashimi that was in my dish and paid."}
{"text":"Japango Sushi Roll was delicious and service was fine, was still quite expensive if you are really hungry might not be the best place."}
{"text":"A late post but thought this would be important to share.  Went here with a friend for lunch and midway through our meal, noticed a LIVE WORM IN THE SUSHI. I was so shocked and appalled I completely forgot to take photographic evidence. When I called the waiter over she quickly took the dish away. Obviously, we left immediately. I called Public Health that afternoon who investigated and got back to me with 48 hours - their freezer was \"working\" but there was no way to tell if they were properly processing their food by guidelines.   In any case - BE CAREFUL AND CHECK YOUR SUSHI FOR ANY LIVE PARASITES FROM THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Japango is a hidden gem. In a city where there's so many sushi restaurants, Japango stands out. This place is always busy during lunch and dinner so try to get a reservation. The sushi and sashimi is fresh and high quality.  The signature Japango roll is delicious. The combined flavours of spicy mayo, seared scallop and seared salmon works well together.   The deluxe sushi and sashimi platters are freshly prepared - sushi purists would approve.   The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because the restaurant itself is very small and the tables and chairs are packed together. It is not the most comfortable setting, but you do not come here for the setting. You come here for the delicious sushi."}
{"text":"6 months after my first visit, I went back there again today and I was very disappointed. I have to change my rating from 4/5 to 2/5.  I ordered the exact same thing, but the ingredients were different than what I got 6 months ago. Please refer to the pic I uploaded before: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/8I5U8OQ06nSxX2y4PPOWzQ?select=f-9b3XuIFPuuF5iki5-7DA In that picture, you can see some gourmet mushrooms such as both white and brown clamshell mushroom, enoki mushrooms, as well as the regular white mashrooms. The scallop was very fresh. Everything was TOP quality. Great quality and fresh ingredient was the only thing I remembered about this place until today.   Today, I didn't see any mushroom at all, they replaced all the mushrooms with green beans and the scallop I had today clearly wasn't fresh. The only thing that remained the same was the price, which I don't think is worth it. I should've taken another picture but it was kinda too late after I started eating and noticed something was different, then I dug my old picture out to confirm my thought and was disappointed at what I found."}
{"text":"Where are my chopsticks?  I know this is a crazy theory but I have a list of 'rule of thumbs' for good restaurants and one of them is: the smaller the restaurant the better experience you'll have. (Japango, Taco El Asador, Churasco's, Country Style Hungarian Restaurant, Stockyards...I could go on)  Japango was until recently, my favourite sushi restaurant in the city (another small spot has captured my heart) but I'm confident it will always stand up in my top five of Japanese eateries. Right now it's in my top two since it's almost impossible to come by good sushi in Toronto.   The fish is fresh, creative and beautifully cut. You're going to get quality at Japango and cuts of fishes you've never heard of. The rolls are small, but they're packed full of flavor. The less rice the better.   Important things to know: - Make a reservation. Their turn over is pretty quick but they're always packed. Even on a Tuesday - Be creative and order off the menu. Ask your server what rolls or fish are special for today. I've been lucky to eat at Japango with an honorary 'chopstick' diner and he introduced me to rolls, fishes and dishes I would have never thought of ordering. - CHOPSTICKS:  If you dine at Japango over a certain amount of times and they get to know you on a more personal level, you get your own set of chopsticks which hang behind the sushi chefs on the wall. It's a true 'wall of fame' for sushi fanatics. You also probably have to spend over $5000 or more before getting them. - Order the Adam Roll (Unagi with a sliver of Avacado) and the Black sesame ice cream. Both delicious. - Japango recently raised prices. They said the owner hasn't touched the prices for 10 years. To be honest, the sushi is worthy of a small price jump and will only weed out the mobs of people who don't appreciate quality fish  I confidently recommend Japango!"}
{"text":"Japango is a little tiny Japanese restaurant tucked away in Elizabeth St.  They offer tradition Japanese food with a modern twist.  If you are in that area and would like some Japanese food, this is the place for you.  They have less than ten tables in the restaurant, so do remember to make reservations or be expected to wait in line.  As our appetizer, we ordered the Tempura Appetizer and Gyoza.  We were quite disappointed with the Tempura as it is not crispy or crunchy at all.  They were soft and soggy.  The Gyoza were good enough, but not memorable as it taste like any other gyoza we had before.    The taste of the Katsu Don was very good.  It has a well balance of sweetness, sourness, and saltiness. However, the texture was not that great as the deep fried pork was very soggy as well.  The Japango Roll is their signature roll.  We are not quite sure what exactly it is made out of, but we are certain that it is a California Roll topped with salmon, scallops, Tobico (flying fish eggs) and some of their signature sauce.  This is truly one of their best dishes.  The Japango Roll has a very soft, creamy, and buttery texture.  The salmon and scallop sashimi are fresh and rich.  In addition, the sauce that they have used is spicy, which adds a little kick to the whole experience.  One of the special dishes that Japango offers is the Tobico with Quail Egg.   With the raw quail egg yolk, the sushi is very rich in flavour.  You can also feel the bursting of each individual flying fish eggs in your mouth in every bite.   Happy chefs making sushi at the bar =)  In general, we did enjoy our dinner at Japango.  We loved their sushi and sashimi. Their staffs are very friendly and helpful in explaining their menu.  We would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-2 Service-3 Food-5 Strikeouts-0/3  My girlfriend and I came here through walk-in and typically this place is so small that the wait time would be approximately 1-2 hours at least. Thankfully, we came back a second time after turning back to try to at least get some take-out and a 2 seater opened up.  Note: The omakase has to be reserved at least a day ahead of time so we got the moriwase and the sashimi!     The fish here is definitely top quality, very close to the top sushi restaurants in Toronto in terms of level, they also offered japanese sea urchin for $24 for two sushi pieces. This was my second time having torched sushi, first time at Kaka all you can eat and I can tell you the difference was night and day. The torched sushi here reignited my flame for the blend of cooked fish and raw. Typically I just like the raw sashimi the best, but this time, all the torched items came up on top. They even had one torched piece beside an equivalent raw piece, which helped differentiate the taste between the two. Needless to say, the food was excellent. We also ordered a Japango roll to finish things off and it was definitely a good roll, and I typically can't appreciate rolls."}
{"text":"Food was good and fresh but not worth the expensive price in my opinion. Restaurant is small and cramped but that wasn't a huge issue. My biggest problem was the customer service.   We saw the other tables were getting treated extremely well. The server introduced every dish to the other tables and made jokes and laughed with them. When it came to our turn, they'd just plop the plate down and would barely put in any energy. When we wanted to order more items, the server seemed annoyed as if we were bothering him - even though he was happy to help the other tables. I think at one point, he ended up just taking our menu away without asking if we were done and just brought out the complementary dessert.   Now, I hate to be the one to bring this up. We're a relatively young Asian couple, and I find that at some Asian establishments, we get treated much more poorly than say, \"other\" groups. Perhaps it was an ageist thing or it was a race thing, but my boyfriend did agree that this is a fairly regular occurrence to him as well - even when he goes out with his family.   I'll leave that up to you, but I won't be coming back.  Edit: upon reading other reviews, it seems as though the server is also the manager/owner. Avoid at all costs, don't spend your hard earned money here."}
{"text":"Cute little Japanese restaurant near the Sheraton where I was staying for work. I had the chirashi supreme (or whatever the name is for the special chirashi bowl). The fish was very fresh and portions were rather large and very decently priced. Also their tempura was amazing! Very light and crispy and not at all oily. Again, portion on that was very large.  I'd definitely come back again next time I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"They said all the ingredients are from Japan. I used to lived in Japan for a long time, there are too many choices in Japan, it is hard to find good sushi like this at the same price. I would like to say the sushi here are really good. Must try!"}
{"text":"Small little place but the food is definitely very good! Came here for lunch and had the lunch chirashi and japango roll. The chirashi was very good - fish was fresh and there was the right amount of fish/rice ratio. Japango roll was pretty good too but pricey for small rolls. Salad had a nice dressing on it. The place is super small so we had to wait 10 main but the food was def worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a hot August Friday. The restaurant is extremely small and was very busy. Uncomfortable to sit, talk and eat due to size and being on top of your neighbor. If you can deal with that, sushi was good and service was fast."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey, but it's totally worth it.   Portions are small, but if you're looking for fresh fish, this is the place.  I did not regret spending $40 for my 15 piece sashimi and half a hotate butter, however, I think on my next visit I'll probably stick with just the rolls (Japango roll, yum)  The place is small. Make sure you have a reservation. The place only has about 6 tables and can fit at most 15 people in the room. It was full at 6pm on a Wednesday night.   I wish I savoured my fish a little more, I was too entranced in conversation. Maybe not the best for $1.60 a piece. The salmon was juicy. The white fish was slightly seared. It was best sashimi in a while.  But this has to be one of the freshest places. Better than Sushi Couture.  The Scallop in Butter and Ponzu was good, but for $6 EACH Piece, that was way too pricey.   They have an Omakase, and I would love to come back and try it on a special occasion.   The server (the only) was really friendly, and help my raw fish allergic friend to well done cook the rolls. Thank you! It was yummy.   Please do not bring a giant knapsack bag in here. It just won't fit. I also want to bring my dad here too, but same problem :p  I would also plan for dessert afterwards, they have only ice cream."}
{"text":"I have to say I was skeptical about this place, particularly the atmosphere, after reading several yelpers comments. My first experience (about 2 mo ago) was great! Yes, the atmosphere is cramped. Yes, it's not ideal. But the rolls! Glorious sushi rolls! I esp liked their signature Japango roll. Not to mention the spicy tuna and the spider roll! Not to be missed, that's for sure.   I've tried several other sushi places in search of great rolls and nothing else seems to compare. Ema Tei, Sushi Inn, Ho Su bistro, Nami, to name a few.   Japango, I'll be going back, despite your crowded seating. Perhaps take out is in order? Looking forward to making more sushi memories..."}
{"text":"Best Chirashi! This place is tiny so make sure you make reservations ahead of time! It's busy and crowded but the food is so good! Might actually be better for take out. Taking one star off for the environment."}
{"text":"Really really good sushi.  Had the eggplant appetizer, seaweed salad, dynamite roll, Chef's selection menu and sesame ice cream all to share.  Service was quick and fish extremely fresh and high quality.  Probably one of the best quality sushi places I've been to in the city.  If it weren't for the space being super cramped (you are literally sitting 2 inches from your neighbour's table) and the price being a little on the high side, I would have rated this place a 5/5.  Will be back, but probably more for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Amazing food! It has been so far my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto. We tried the noodles with vegetables, spicy tuna roll, signature roll and tempura, and everything was fresh and delicious!! The place is very small, but that's part of the charm..."}
{"text":"How have I been walking past this restaurant for the past 4 years and never been?!  On Yelp, there were mixed reviews about this place, but I would highly recommend y'all to come and try this place out for yourselves. I had the Chirashi don and my friend had the Sashimi one lunch set, both recommendations from the waitress. The sashimi comes out looking fresh and beautiful. The taste was also impeccable, each piece melts in your mouth! I particularly enjoyed the seared sashimi, as it was the most tender and bursting with flavour. The rice, which is just as important as the fish itself, was slightly tangy from the vinegar and acted as a good complement.  The restaurant is pretty tiny and unassuming, but that's what makes Japango such an authentic experience. Prices were pretty reasonable for lunch, although it is leaning on the pricey side for dinner."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the fact that I ate the bento lunch special (which was a salmon steak instead of a filet), but I was not impressed.  I admit that the ambience is superb with the long bench along one wall and spices kept in bamboo boxes suspended behind the chefs, but the service was awful.    First, after tipping over the tea because of the unstable table, the waitress didn't bring new napkins until asked.  Then, they never cleared our miso bowls and instead kept piling food on the table until there was no more room...Mind you the table was less than 2 feet wide.  What really turned me off is that we needed to ask for water.  Maybe they were having an off day."}
{"text":"The waiter are mysteriously condescending. I was just Questioning the cutting skills and the freshness of the material basing on the very unpleasant look of the dish VERY NICELY in VERY LOW VOICE, which lead to a finding that the waiters are very good at yelling at costumers and very good at thinking their costumers are extremely stupid that they don't understand Japanese food at all(themselves are Korean). They yelled at me with an essays that has the conclusion that we should never come back because our doubts are bothering the surrounding costumers. The insane logic nearly made me laugh. Sashimi should be always presented as art with honesty and modesty. It an art of Japanese culture. When a restaurant receives a doubt(none of my friends are picking a fight), they did not even consider the possibility that it might be their problem. They were extremely steady about how stupid we are and we know nothing about Japanese food and come back to me twice saying we should just never come back. Yea, of course I am not coming back. I feel not only disappointed by the food quality but also frustrated by the extreme attitude I received from the sever. I am not asking love from them but just needing simple respect when I am expressing my reasonable doubt.  I stayed in Toronto for four year, US for one year and eating sashimi for six year. and now working in downtown. This is the worst experience ever. I end up not giving tip because I do not feeling like paying for getting humiliated.  Go there if y r feeling anger-needed and feeling curious about how bad food can be when your r eating in an extremely unpleasant surrounding. No photo attached, my mood now is a disaster."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best sushi I've tried in Toronto. The fish is very fresh, the service is quick and the lunch combo is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Very small place! They take reservations and there was a wait on a Thursday night.   I ordered the crispy spicy Tina and eel and avocado roll. Both were fantastic. The spicy sauce was more than just mayo and srircha. It was very spicy (good thing for me).  The tuna was very good, the type of fresh and tenderness that tasted fresh. The eel was my favourite, seasoned well and not too salty. The atmosphere is very \"datey\", dark and tables meant for couples when separated and busy. The service is quick and food was brought out within 10min of ordering.   It loses points because it's expensive. 2 rolls for $21? You can pay a little more for ayce with less quality (which is fine for me). I've had sushi at a fish market in Japan. And it was priced fair. Would hit up sushi on bloor over this place anytime based on value. The service was also pushy to get you in and out."}
{"text":"All the way home in the car, I kept saying 'oh my god. That was so good.' Of all the sushi I have ever had in Toronto, and even in California, Japango is definitely in the top 3. First of all, it blows doors on anything in Toronto. Sorry Nami, I have a new fave~! Very small restaurant - had reservations, seated no problem.  Everything we ordered was amazing. I can't wait to go back. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Price (4/5)  I've noticed they recently increased their prices without informing regular customers. It's only a few dollars but the portions are the same as the previous price.   I'm okay with the increase but for lunch, I'll reserve for a fancy / stressful time and craving legit sushi. You get what you pay for esp if it's fresh seafood!  Food (5/5)  I love this place. I highly recommend the chirashi and if you want sea urchin, upgrade to their deluxe which will include it and more sushi pieces.   Japango roll is their signature sushi that's popular for a reason. It has quite a bit of heat so if you're not into spicy food maybe avoid it. I love it     Also, their tempura udon is amazing and comes with miso and salad.  It's one of the best udons I've had even in comparison with Japan!  Atmosphere/ Decor (2/5)  It's tiny and claustrophobic. If you're a lady with a huge Neverfull tote bag, don't bring it bc there won't be space for it even if you put it on the floor. I'd recommend just taking your wallet with you for this place if you work nearby or get take out.   Take out through Ritual app is highly recommended. Avoid the crowds and get your food faster. Plus you don't have to pay tip.   Customer Service  As a regular customer, I've personally never had a problem with their customer service. Yes, the guy waiting tables can be rude but I'm used to it and pretty much all Chinese restaurants are like that.   If you have a problem, just get take out. They're super busy for a reason bc of their yummy sushi."}
{"text":"PROS: -Fresh, delectable sushi. One time I saw the sushi chef walk into the resto carrying a collosal piece of fresh fish on ice, neat-o.  -Complimentary tempura and edamame.   CONS: -Long wait time if its full (the place is tiny).    OVERALL: -Definitely a Toronto sushi place worth checking out. P.S. get the Japango roll"}
{"text":"Came in around 5 which on a Friday which was a nice quiet time. The place itself is relatively small, so it's a good idea to go before or after the dinner rush. It's a super cozy cute place.   The staff is super friendly and attentive so we were in and out probably within 30 minutes.   I had mad sushi cravings coming in and everything was super fresh and well presented - a much better choice than ayce in my opinion. The meal was on the pricier side and the portions were small too but the quality really made up for it.  Will definitely come back here in the future!"}
{"text":"Lovely and tasteful selection of fish. Unfortunately the place is really small and cannot take larger parties unless you go at an off peak time. I went around 6 and there was a two seater table available to us."}
{"text":"After a streak of eating mediocre food, Japango was a welcome changed.  I dropped by here for dinner takeout and I want to go back already.  The restaurant is small, but it was packed on a Monday night.  There were still a couple of tables opened if I had wanted to dine in.  Salmon Nigiri $5/2 pieces - WOW!  Very impressed with these.  I never had nigiri butterflied like this this before, and the marbling was amazing.  Big delicious fresh pieces of sushi, I want to try the others now.  Japango Maki Roll $13 - This was good, but I'm more of a crunchy roll or full of flavor rolls kinda gal.  This roll has salmon with seared scallop on top.  The service was quick.  The wait for my food was less than 10 minutes.  I came later in the week for lunch and was able to call in to make a reservation for 2 at 1245p.  The table was ready for us when we arrived early at 1230.  It was the only table left at the time.  Sashimi Bento Box $14 - 10 pieces of sashimi (including 3 tuna and 3 salmon), rice, salad, and little veggies here an there.  I think it's supposed to come with soup also, but I didn't get mine (didn't realized this until after lunch).  Pretty good lunch, but not as impressive as dinner (maki and nigiri).  The Hours: Daily 11:30 am to 10:30 pm.  Things I want to try next: Soft Shell Crab $12 Scallop on a half shell $12 Crunchy Roll $8 Spicy Scallop roll $9 Dynamite Roll $9 Crunchy Spicy Turn $9 Hamachi Sushi $7"}
{"text":"Japango is a great place if I want to get decent sushi in the downtown core. There are very few selections in terms of sushi restaurants when you're looking for quality sushi that won't give you food poisoning (yes, this sadly happened to me :(  its not my  #1 place for sushi, but its high enough up there. RESERVATIONS is a must here! Aaannnd I'm pretty sure me and my friend just joined in on someones first date. The tables are literally like 1 inch apart from each other, you can't help it! I think they enjoyed our company :P it was better than the couple to our right who were yelling at each other from the top of their lungs! -_-"}
{"text":"While I was warned about how tiny this place was from previous reviews, I had no idea how extremely tiny it was. They had given away our reservation after we showed up late but that wasn't a big problem and we understood their need to seat everyone. My advice would be to go right when they open so you can be seated right away. The food was a bit on the pricey side but the quality is spectacular. The fish is so fresh and not just the regular plain pieces you would expect at other Japanese restaurants. There was so much flavour. In my opinion, the best option for lunch is definitely the Chirashi. You get your money's worth in terms of the sashimi and the rice is uniquely and perfectly seasoned.  The only problem I had with this is that my friend and I came on a separate occasion and each ordered a lunch combo. We asked for ice cream afterwards, as we had assumed it had come with the combo like many other Japanese restaurants. It doesn't. And we were also not informed of such. They just brought it to us and charged us $5 (which is pretty high for two scoops of regular green tea ice cream...) When asked about this, the manager said \"nowhere on the menu does it say it comes with ice cream.\" That's fine, I guess it's my fault for assuming but it also sounded pretty accusatory on their part.   Food's good though."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for 2 on a Friday. In general this is a cheaply-priced place - and you get what you pay for.  I ordered the Sushi 2 for $20 (12 pieces nigiri and 6 Cali roll) and my partner ordered Salmon bento for $13.   Food quality was ok - fish wasn't that fresh (my hamachi was going flabby) and some pieces of nigiri had a substantial amount of rice, others barely - like a half a pinky barely! My partner's salmon tasted good, but her rice was quite dry.  Service was quite rushed, and servers were mostly interested in getting us out the door than making sure we were actually enjoying our food. We were the first ones in the restaurant and got our food within 3-4 minutes of our ordering, which led me to believe their food was pre-made... something you DO NOT want to have for a dish you're paying $20 for...   Price, service, and food-quality-wise this place is right in between its neighbours Yukata and Kyoto House. I'd probably opt to go to either one of those than spend a moderate amount of money on lunch to get a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Couldn't have found on a more perfect place for a nice and classy dinner before a night at the ballet.  The food: Ocean trout sashimi - appearance is similar to salmon sashimi. Actually, now that I think about it, tastes pretty similar too. They leave a little bit of the skin on, adding a slightly bitter note that just makes you even more appreciative of the sweetness from the trout  BBQ eel sushi- In the words of that ol' Folgers coffee jingle, \"So fresh...so fresh and exciting to me!\"   Lobster roll- one of the more impressive items on the menu in terms of presentations, as they plate it with the lobster tail carcass. One must try the roll with the drizzled sauce. This is key!  Crunchy Salmon roll- salmon is melt-in-your-mouth soft. The fish is truly the centerpiece of the roll. This is what differentiates it from the lower quality sushi joints, where the pieces of tempura and rice takes precedence   All else that enriched our experience: The service - our waitress was so genuinely friendly. Not the type of friendly where you feel like it's a hit it and tip it, but a genuine friendliness that makes you feel like she just wants you to appreciate the food as much as she does. My dinner date actually questioned how someone can be so happy. Fo reals though, I would be this happy too if I worked here and got to eat fresh and amazing seafood like this everyday.   The atmosphere- Being a super small restaurant that seats appr. 15, one would typically be none too pleased with being elbow to elbow with fellow diners. But I feel like this coziness just added to Japango's charm and character. The type of charm where where it makes you want to hug the person beside you and talk to them about how fresh your sashimi is.   Dum dum dum...the missing star explanation:  Less variety and \"unique\" items than its sister restaurant, Yuzu (same management). However, what it does have, it does extremely well."}
{"text":"Final Word: Pretty consistent moderately priced sushi restaurant in Toronto.  Not overly pricey but also not the cheapest, this long time staple on Elizabeth St. (@ Dundas St.) has been around for a long time and early on, set the benchmark for quality sushi at reasonable prices.  Over the past few years, there have been some pretty fierce competitors, including Wow! Sushi on Charles St., and while I do give the edge to Wow! Sushi (when they're on the ball), I can still reliably count on Japango to be pretty consistent.  I've tried their Japango Roll, Chirashi Bowl, Deluxe Bento and other various dishes.  Overall, pretty good."}
{"text":"Food was good and fresh, can't complain. But service was really really bad. We made reservation for 5 ppl, for some reason our waiter wasn't happy that it's 5 of us and we will be seating at the table for 6. He didn't allow me to seat at the chair I wanted. His explanation was that nobody should seat at the corner because it would be inconvenient for him to serve the table next to us. I assure you there were enough space for it. Then after we ordered food he said that they have this policy that for groups of five and more minimum charge is $35. Which is weird, but we were ok with that. We asked for bill and wanted to pay from separate cards. His reply was very interesting, he said that he doesn't want to do so, cause it might cause a line for people who want to use the machine.How ridiculous is that? After wasting our time he said that this time he can make an exception for us,lol .i was very upset that tips were already included in a bill.Maybe it's a good place for two, but for groups it's no no.Too many ridiculous rules"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi from the house roll to sake to clam soup."}
{"text":"Known for their impeccable sushi, Japango has sushi and Japanese cuisine lovers ranting and raving for their fare.  Conveniently tucked away behind City Hall on Elizabeth St and Dundas St. W in the heart of the downtown Toronto core, Japango has quite the following.  This is especially true during the lunch time rush where they attract a loyal crowd that fills to capacity - partly because of their ability to seat no more than 20 people at once, which is also a major drawback.  If you can snag a pair of seats, you'll be delighted by their approach to Japanese cuisine, which is a nice with the plethora of so-called \"Japanese\" restaurants in Toronto.    A quick tip: if you become one of their loyal patrons, they will treat you as such and even reserve you a pair of chopsticks with your name prominently displayed on their \"Wall of Recognition.\""}
{"text":"Really solid sushi for a really decent price. Only downside is how tiny the place is. Probably seats 14 people max, so if you want to try Japango, MAKE A RESERVATION and then expect to wait 15-30 minutes for your reservation even when you arrive on time.  The sushi was worth the wait. My husband got the sashimi deluxe and I got the Japango roll and a spicy scallop roll. All the sushi and sashimi was so fresh and tender.   Personally wasn't a fan of the Japango roll. Too much sauce that I felt overpowers the fresh fish. I LOVED the scallop roll. Best scallop roll I've ever had. It tasted so buttery and sweet. Next time I'd just get nigiri or rolls ala carte."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  Oh, oh, oh.  My hands are waiving in between key strokes for added drama here.  This place is so good! After ready several hefty reviews in praise of this little sushi shop, first, I clued my lost self into where it was, and secondly, hiked down there for a mid day meal.    Being 3pm, I was relieved, not only to find that it was open, and as well, that I would not be the only one in there.  The other diner left as soon as I ordered.  However, it being such a petite little space, I was surrounded by various staff, and figured this could be considered all the company I needed.  And then, the food arrived.  A trio of varied rolls, neatly tucked into bite size prices of magic, sat before me.  I'll emphasize here, the size of the rolls, as they were fantastically appropriate.  I'm looking at you, Gallery Sushi, and your giant hungry man two bite sushi.  Rice belly, no more!  You have been replaced!  As well, the rice was soft and warm, cozy, even.  The fish, fresh, delicate, and bright.  Even the service was friendly and welcoming, much like the goods served here.  So pleased!  I even saved a few bits to bring back to work and share the happy words and tastes of said discovery.   My co-worker booked date night here as a result.  And I'm sure she'll enjoy it as much as I just did.     See you soon, Japango.  See you soon."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I absolutely have to do this one.  I first tried Japango 5 years ago. The food was good, and I'd go every week. I was a regular.  Now I'm disappointed every time I go, and I'll show you why in a photo.  I ordered the pork katsu don (fried pork chop on rice) to go, and instead I got what seemed like fried batter on rice. The layer of pork is so thin that you can barely find any. This is unacceptable.  There may still be delicious stuff on their menu, but the fact that they'd cut corner in ANY dish like that is enough for me to never want to come back."}
{"text":"It's been 2 years since my last review!?! OMG WHHYYY. I just popped in for dinner today and was reminded by how amazing it was. Previously I had only gone for lunch service. I went for a super late dinner-- around 9PM but the place was still packed. My wait was only 15 minutes and the service was impeccable. My hot tea was re-filled before I even had to ask. I ordered the sashimi deluxe and the fish was just as impeccable as my last visit. The soy sauce is still as amazing..even though the fish was so perfect it didn't need the soy sauce at all. I just used a tiny bit. The space is very small but it really transforms and makes you feel like you are in Japan. I had to change my review from 4 to 5 stars because that is what it is now. The FOH /waiter was amazing--was his name Victor? I thought that was what I heard when he was on the phone but yeah..  I loved the regulars get their own chopsticks. If I were a regular I'd have a pair hanging up there for sure."}
{"text":"I love finding little hole-in-the wall sushi gems like this. This place is quite literally a hole in the wall. Ventured here with my boyfriend on a Sunday during a Labor Day weekend trip to Toronto. We didn't have a reservation, and upon walking up weren't actually able to squeeze into the doorway for a couple of min. About 5-10 min later we were told to come back in 20 and they'd have a table ready for us. I'd definitely recommend a reservation. We got a drink nearby and came back as instructed though, and it was worth the wait! The atmosphere is very cozy and intimate. We devoured 6 rolls between the 2 of us and also ordered a large sake and a couple of Sapporos. Sake bombs in Canada, why not? The sushi was delicious with incredibly fresh ingredients, nothing fancy. If I ever find myself back in Toronto, I'll definitely seek out Japango again."}
{"text":"Really overpriced for the quality and size of sushi you get. I always use the quality of salmon to judge the freshness of the fish, I've eaten here twice and the salmon never is the quality I expect. I've honestly had better quality of salmon at an AYCE sushi place...that's really saying something.  Do yourself a favor- stay away and save yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"Went there during non-busy time on the weekend. I had their lunch chirashi, my wife had their 10 piece sushi. Flavours are very good for the price. The sashimi and sushi were both better than average japanese ala cartes.  Service was speedy and nice. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Fan-freakin-tasty!   The wait may be long. Place maybe small. Really small...but, totally worth it! Service & food great!"}
{"text":"Extremely extremely poor & unprofessional service. Will NEVER go back there. One item we ordered was the squid sushi listed as $6 on the menu. The menu also had a fine print which says \"some fish may be seasonal, check with waiter for selection\". Which should just mean check with waiter for availability. However, when we got the bill, the squid sushi becomes $10 listed under \"sushi special\". That is a 40% price difference!! We asked the waiter, but he says the squid sushi is under seasonal price (never mentioned to us when we were ordering).  As we demand the menu, read out the price and fine print clearly to him, and asked him to change the bill, he started talking a whole bunch bullshit to us, which includes 1 - we did not ask him about the seasonal price when ordering (?? shouldn't he be telling us if the menu price was wrong?) 2 - it will take at least 30 mins to update the bill (??) 3 - he gave us free soup & salad, so now we shouldn't care about the $4 (??) 4 - if the bill is adjusted, he would need to charge an additional mandatory gratuity on everyone's bill (already paid for), because we are a group of 5 (??)  5 - the restaurant serves a higher end clientele of people who don't care about a buck or two differences (WTF???)  It was just one bullshit after another. The waiter did not even apologize once throughout. How can there be a \"seasonal price\" that was not shown on the menu, not mentioned to us in any way, and now we're forced to pay for??!!"}
{"text":"16 seat restaurant so call ahead for a reservation. It's a tight squeeze and they get you served fast and give you the bill in about an hour. The sushi is exquisite. One of the best in the city. The bill came to $80 including tip for two of us and we had one Tall can of beer each; $20. It's not the cheapest but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"The decision to come to japango was all based on yelp reviews and they did not disappoint. The sushi was fresh and the presentation was beautiful. We were one of two tables in the restaurant so the sushi came out quickly.   The big knock on japango was the small size and the tight tables. I felt like I was on a date with the table next to me.   I highly recommend japango. For those having difficulty choosing a sushi roll, get the japango roll and crunchy spicy tuna rolls."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I've had in Toronto, so far. Considering the price range, the quality of the food was excellent.  The restaurant is tiny (and a bit cramped). When I went for lunch, I got a table right away, but I suspect that might not be the case at night.  Definitely not a place to take large groups, but I would strongly suggest going here for the sushi."}
{"text":"Scallop (Starter): 3/5. Not my type. The scallops are not fresh, I guess they were treated with water. The juice underneath is a bit flat and only has a mushroom flavour.  Unaju: 2/5. Nothing special just something you can get from an AYCE. When we got the bento, the spoon was in the rice, making it oily and difficult to use.  Zara Soba: 3/5. The only reason I would order this is that there aren't too many places in Toronto that offer it. However compared to the soba I've had in the other cities I would say it's just average.   Their service is also poor, I had the server grab the menu without asking."}
{"text":"We went to Japango upon recommendation from a friend as we needed a place to grab lunch after a wedding ceremony.  We lucked out and got the last table for 4 at around 2pm on a Saturday! I'm from Vancouver and have had a lot of great sushi.  Japango was pretty awesome!  All the ingredients were really fresh - right down to the cucumber!  The spicy tuna was fantastic, and the japango roll is a must try!  I definitely recommend trying this place.  It's small and a bit of a hole in the wall but so delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. The main waiter was extremely rude not just to our table, but others around us."}
{"text":"I adore this place and promote it aggressively to all my friends and acquaintances. This is one of the few restaurants that I will go back to but lately I noticed a man maybe owner? doing all the serving in the evening, not sure if anyone else has noticed but i feel a little rushed and and that his customer service skills are a little bit lacking. I understand it's a business at the end of the day but sometimes it's nice to find a gem of a restaurant that seems to care about customer experience just as much. Not sure if he's got a lot on his mind anyways it's too bad, dining here now is a completely different atmosphere quite a downgrade compared to what it used to be when it was extremely courteous and attentive like it is in Japan.   Guess I could treat this place as a lunch spot rather than anything special."}
{"text":"I ordered a chirashi supreme for dinner and tasted love. This $28 thing is proof of a higher power. They even had seared sashimi and it's a LOT of stuff! Their rice has sushi vinegar which was absolutely lovely, with grilled unagi and some fried mushrooms in top, and sesame. It was divine. Sashimi was very fresh and the piece of lime they gave helped elevate the flavours. It was beautiful.   This is a very tiny restaurant, practically a hole in the wall. The sign is tattered and faded out, and there probably aren't more than 10 tables inside. It was a bit stuffy when we went in (outside was like 14 degrees) so it was a huge difference in temp going in. I'm by no means large but it was tough getting into the seats. I don't know how people get in in the winter because a coat would have taken up the space of two seats!   Their tables were a bit tiny. When our orders came with our drinks, we had to play Tetris with the dishes and cups to make sure nothing fell. Dinner and entertainment for sure.   Although it's tiny, I like the coziness of it. It really adds a level of intimacy.   Also, not my table, but the next table over had a regular. The staff gave her her own chopsticks (as opposed to the disposable ones us peasants get) and she was delighted. The sushi chef talked with her and was very personable. What a smart move to hook customers in!   Food was 5/5, the plum wine was a bit too sweet for my liking, and I like plum wine in general. Seating was a 3/5 (too squishy), ambience is 4/5 (cozy but too stuffy). Good thing they don't have teppanyaki because I'm sure everyone in the restaurant would have sweated buckets.   I def recommend this lovely place. I need to find more reasons to frequent this hidden Toronto gem."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a late dinner at Japango on a Sunday night expecting the restaurant to be quiet, I was surprised that it was totally packed!   We had a similar experience to other Yelpers in that when we arrived on time for our reservation all the tables were full and we were asked to wait 15+ minutes.   On top of that, when we were finally shown to our table someone waiting in line after us insisted that we change tables with her so that she didn't have to sit next to the window (?). The waitress asked us to relocate. Needless to say, we were VERY unimpressed by the time we sat down.  The waitress was very apologetic and offered us free salads, miso soups, and free hand rolls. I appreciated the gesture, but I was unimpressed with our initial experience. From this point on service was attentive and we were happy with the experience.  Onto the food! We ordered several dishes  1. Japango roll: tasty, definitely recommend 2. Crunchy, spicy salmon roll: I love this spicy salmon, it's not too creamy like other rolls in the city. Definitely has spice. 3. Tuna tartare appetizer: phenomenal, had a light tomato taste, very special.  4. Chefs selection sashimi & sushi ($50): Great selection to try the fish at Japango. A bit too expensive in my opinion.  Miso soup, salads (green & wakame) were duds. It's the same thing you would get at a cheapo sushi place. Don't waste the money or calories! When I return I will only get sushi/sashimi and rolls."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service! Coming back again for sure. Highly recommended! One of the best Japanese restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Since I was curious about this establishment, i've decided to check out this place. The place was cramp and sushi were a disappointment and overpriced. Will not return again."}
{"text":"Japango is the definiton of hidden gem. A very teeny tiny hidden gem.  I ventured into Japango for dinner having seen high reviews on Yelp. What I failed to read was that it has roughly 6 or 7 tables in the entire restaurant. I'm sure my face was hilarious as I made this discovery upon entering. Thankfully, there was a table opening up shortly, otherwise I would have missed out on some phenomenal sushi.  Once I was seated, my server promptly brought me tea and took my order. I started with their green salad with ginger dressing. It tasted wonderful, the only downfall was how small it was. Then came my rolls: caterpillar and dragon. My WORD were they delicious. All of the ingredients, especially the fish are high-quality and fresh, plus you can watch the sushi chefs making them behind the bar. I couldn't possibly find room to finish both rolls, but I am glad I tried two in order to get some variety.  The dinner was fantastic, I just would recommend:  A.) Going with someone else - I enjoyed every minute but it was a little awkward sitting alone since you are so close to the other tables around you. I unfortunately didn't have anyone to accompany me since I was on a solo work trip.  B.) If you do go with other people, stick to a small group and make a reservation.  Beyond that, anyone in Toronto craving sushi should head to Japango - it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I didn't try the Sushi, but the Udon was great."}
{"text":"Holy shit the sushi here tastes good but so expensive and the restaurant is so tiny.  I ordered a japango roll/(8 pcs, $13) and the spicy crunchy salmon roll (6 pcs, $9). The japango was definitely very tasty and the other was good too. The total came to $24 for just those rolls. In other sushi restaurants, there is usually some additional items like soup, salad to help fill you up or a combo but not here.  It seems that this place also had some celebrity guests so that seems Impressive.  I am so conflicted about this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"First visit impressions are very good. The place is small, i mean tiny(whole in the wall). I made reservations after reading about just how small the place was....it is even smaller than i imagined. The staff is very friendly and the chefs were very accommodating to both me and my guests specific requirements. Food was served within 10 minutes, I had the Vegetable Tempura Udon soup and my guest had the Salmon sushi plate. The soup was very good and it was a huge portion, i really liked that the veggies in the tempura were not the usual suspects, they put squash and eggplant. My highest praise is for the fact that we did not get kicked out...we stayed for 2 1/2hrs in that tiny little place. It was a bit pricey, but worth a once a month treat. My only complaint....the tea was always just warm, never hot. Will visit again, maybe take out next time."}
{"text":"ok still the avacado maki is unbelievable, but this time when we went my partner ordered a miso soup (on the menu it says that it includes tofu, seaweed, and scallions) but it was pretty much all broth (aside from one small piece of tofu and seaweed). My partner told the server that it was only broth and he said that's just how they do it there! Which is a complete lie considering that it says differently on their menu...sooo I don't know I have mixed feelings. The one server is kind of a dick but the food is very fresh. I stick to saying to just get takeout and probably don't order the miso soup."}
{"text":"This is the most legit sushi place I have been to. I am no expert on Japanese sushi but it seemed that this is a very authentic place to visit if you want to get the real deal. They had tons of exotic sounding choices and also daily rare specials.  As for the vibe, this is a TINY place, perhaps only room for 20 or so people? And they do pack you in like sardines, but it is all part of the experience to me. I could see how it may be a bit of a long wait at peak times, but we were seated within two minutes of arriving.  The BF and I ordered a few dishes to share. To start we had the standard miso soup and green salad. Soup was good, nothing out of the ordinary. I really liked the ginger spiked dressing on the salad though, different than other sushi places I have been to.  The next course was tempura, hot and crispy, with a savoury dipping sauce - tasty!  As for rolls, we sampled the california, spicy salmon, and Japango. I liked all of them with my favourite being the spicy salmon. A nice amount of heat and also crunch inside the rolls, YUMMERS! The Japango roll was also very good, I liked the seared salmon and scallop on top, never tried a roll like this before but enjoyed it very much.  My BF ended up ordering a beef teriyaki dish with a side of rice as well and I was pleasantly surprised at the tender texture of the meat, it was very good.  The waiter was kind enough to bring us a scoop of both green tea and black sesame ice cream as he overheard us saying we couldn't decide on which one. Overall, a nice date experience, I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"They've done it. They got me hooked up and I'm putting up the last star. You really have to consider so many factors when evaluating sushi joints, in my mind they go 1) quality of fish 2) quality of other menu items 3) price 4) atmosphere  You can go to Sushi Kaji and it's damn fresh but you're wallet doesn't feel good when it's empty. You can go to Sushi on Bloor, it's above average and cheap.  Japango is the perfect medium, high quality sushi at a decent price point.  Highlights, spicy scallop roll, japango roll, high quality sashimi, udon....beautifully constructed and fresh.  My go-to place.....if you're hungry and love a deal, sushi on bloor is great, if you're a freshness nazi and lacking personal finance skills, kaji is more your style...please leave Japango alone so I can get a seat because they only have like four in total."}
{"text":"SUPER SMALL place.....MAKE RESERVATIONS! I was there by myself and thought I didn't need to make reservations (what restaurant doesn't have room for 1?) but I did just in case. Thank goodness that I did. Many people were turned away because they were fully booked.  Food was good. Prices were average. Service was quick."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's super super small so make sure you make a reservation before.  The fish it's really fresh. They have lots of variety (fish) most of the time they play jazz music  I like that,  all the sushi chefs are Japanese and the servers as well, very traditional and creative at the same time. The only thing I don't find great is the way they explain the rolls in the menu, or I should say, how there is no explanation, I know -you can ask the server- the place is tiny and there is usually only one person in the floor so is really busy, anyways, if you go often enough you'll know what you like. Our personal favorites:   Japango roll Crunchy spicy salmon hand roll"}
{"text":"This review is only for Japango's Unagi Don.   The unagi is of great quality - tender, sweet and succulent - and as expected, Japango's sushi rice (\"shari\") is top-notch. Actually, I quite enjoyed this dish. What made it special to me was the Japanese pepper (\"sansho\") sprinkled on the fluffy shari. I haven't seen any other restaurants do this yet even though it's quite a traditional pairing. The mild spiciness and rich fragrance really added another dimension of flavour. Tasty!  The disappointing factor in all this is the rice/unagi ratio considering that this is priced at $20.00 + tax. I can easily finish the unagi and leave more than half a bowl of rice.  Stick with their top-notch best-in-the-city sashimi and Japango rolls!"}
{"text":"Their japango roll is the most AMAZING roll I've ever gotten. Also, their chirashi bowl is an amazing deal. The quality of the fish is fantastic and they're very sweet and accommodating."}
{"text":"Neat little place if you want authentic japanese experience in terms of space availability (this place is tiny as hell).  The place is owned by korean yet they've done an excellent job with the decor and creating one of a kind ambiance. I am korean but lived in Tokyo for a year and for me to feel that this place gives off authentic japanese experience, it holds some merit in my humble opinion.  The price is bit on the higher end.  My wife and I had dinner, we were stuffed (mind you, we aer not big eaters, but rather, frequent small portion eaters..) from Chirashi Don @ $20 (reg., not delux) and moriawase (chef's choice of sashimi 12 pcs and sushi - 5 pcs) with 1 tall boy of Asahi and the bill rang up to $88 after tax and with tip, it was over $50 per person.  They thew in some type of clam soup in buttery miso broth that was oishii as hell.  The quality of fish though, is superior to most places i normally go to, but then again, most places that I'm comparing to are $20-25 places.  Sashimi pieces are generous size and it also included Chu-toro (semi fatty tuna belly) but i thought for a $50 item, it lacked portion i thought.  Their soy sauce, i believe, is home made.  So very delicious and has perfect sweetness to it that I taste from many of the home made soy sauce.  The presentation of their dishes are immaculate, the seasoning of their rice in Chirashi don was very subtle and unique but definitely not boring or typical.  The sweetness and the slight sourness were just right.  I could just eat their sushi rice with their soy sauce and be content.  All in all, i like the place.  It's not a place where i'll pay weekly visits but once in a while, with special occasion, i'll definitely come back.  I think the best bang for the buck is definitely the Chirashi for $20.  But be aware of the tight space and not so stellar services for the amount of $ you will fork out for your meal.  Food is 4 / 5, but the service, in my opinion, is 3 / 5 and I'm being generous."}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars, I would give 3.5 for this place. The location is convenient if you are in downtown. It is a small place, and tables are so tiny and close to each other. My friend and I came here for lunch on Saturday. They didn't have any bento lunch specials that day for some reason. We both got sushi combo A. It was OK, nothing special.I paid $20 including tax and tip which is not too bad.   I don't see myself coming back here. There is nothing special about this place. I would rather pay more for better quality sushi or pay less to stuff myself with cheap and filling sushi.   I would only recommend this place to people who are in downtown and really craving for sushi and not willing to pay so much for it."}
{"text":"You won't find fresher sushi in the city. It's the size of my closet though so reservations are a must."}
{"text":"I have been to Japango in the past. Without doubt, the food is very good there (already stated by others.) I'm glad such a place exists in downtown Toronto --just a shame that there are so few of comparable quality/freshness/simplicity in the core. Sadly however, as Japango has very limited seating and is exceedingly popular, management have seemingly decided they can be rude and discriminatory toward their clientele. With plans to attend a show later nearby one Friday night at 6pm I entered hoping to be able to dine there, despite not having made reservations. I waited a few min and after being approached by the hostess and asking for a table for two (i explained i was waiting for someone) she told me that all tables were reserved for the entire evening(!) Two tables were empty but i know how solidly they get booked. It was the uncharacteristically ungracious way that she looked at me and said there was nothing available the whole night that took me aback. I thanked her and went outside. My boyfriend arrived shortly thereafter and met me out front. I told him it was all booked but that perhaps he should go in and just check himself, which he did, and sure enough--he was very promptly given a table and called me on his cell phone fr inside to tell me so. Conclusion: he left, we did not eat there that evening. While walking to another place, I called Japango on the phone and explained in detail what had just happened. The female employee (likely the same i had spoken to) had little to say for herself except Sorry--after the fact. Perhaps I find it ironic that they would choose to discriminate for whatever reason against a female SE Asian customer over a male European one but they must realise they can afford to. Having grown up in colorful TO i truly believe we have relatively few issues re race as a city. What a pathetic example of smallmindedness this was!"}
{"text":"This is a really small sushi bar. I would not recommend parties of more than 4 to visit this place ... as the wait during dinner hours would be painful! But the staff was quite efficient at 'prompting' diners who have finished their meals to pay and leave. I was there with a friend at around 7 pm on a weekday - managed to get a table after a 15-minute wait!  I ordered its Sushi Dinner Platter which came with a miso soup and salad. The salad was very fresh and the dressing was refreshing and yet savoury! Miso soup tasted great, and not out of a packet!  The sushi platter came with 8 Nigirizushi of different sashimis and 6 Uramaki (avocado and crabmeat sticks). The sashimis were incredibly fresh! The wasabe and ginger slices provided were godsend!  Each sushi on the platter had successfully teleported me to Japan.  Sadly, this place does not serve desserts, besides ice-cream."}
{"text":"I love Japango! It's a super cute yet super small sushi restaurant.   I recommend going during their lunch service to try the bento boxes/sushi specials if you want to save a little money. It is on the pricer side and has a more limited menu then you are use to but the quality is there. Nice staff, cozy atmosphere and feels like a local restaurant you would stumble upon in Japan. :)  This place is quite popular and has very limited seating, like less then 15-20 people in total I think? So come in very small groups (2-4 people max)! Do not even dream of getting a table for a group of 7-8 people in the evening unless you are hoping for a foodie miracle or are very very patient. Haha. If you go during day time though, you will likely find seating.   Tip: Best seats are more to the front, away from the washroom at the back. Just sayin'"}
{"text":"So after reading so many pleasant reviews from fellow Yelpers about this place, I caved in. Honestly, this joint didn't disappoint.   I went in the afternoon at 12:30pm with the gf and I found myself lining outside already. It's really in a hidden location, right next to an AYCE sushi restaurant. (Kyoto?) But to do so well beside it, you can tell that customers really value the quality and freshness of the food at Japango, over the mere quantity of an AYCE.  It's a really small place and it's not advisable with large groups. Service was spot on, ensuring that tea/water is constantly filled and your order has been filled.  We ordered the sushi combination and sashimi lunch special. As consistent with the other reviews, it really does live up to the freshness and mouth-melting taste experience that I've had in downtown, TO. The other notable dishes that I noticed around were the tempura udon noodles and the Japango maki rolls. They looked so good!  Unfortunately, lunch break was short, but I would be back to try those out."}
{"text":"Very fast dining, from what I have experienced (my partner and I were in and out after 35 minutes, with plates taken hastely off table).  I've had better (and cost friendly) sushi from other joints. The salmon nigiri was stringy and quite dry. Not tender and moist like one would expect."}
{"text":"Make a reservation!  We lucked out my just squeezing into a tiny table here.  It's a popular joint and for good reason.  The seating is quite tight but it was worth it considering the quality and freshness of the sushi.  The service was very friendly and the food was delicious.  We were encouraged to try their Chef's fresh fish of the day, which we happily obliged.  The fish was certainly fresh, and served whole, but partly filleted; they surprised us by bring back the fish after we had \"finished\" with it completely fried, expecting we would completely consume the fish, bones and all.  We tried, but didn't do as well as a few older ladies who really did eat the fish in its entirety, like a shark might.   The maki rolls were among the best I've eaten anywhere and we vowed to make this our new pre-Massey Hall dinner spot... and to remember to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Strolling around Downtown with Iriana from the financial district to Eaton Centre and Yonge Dundas Square, food from the LAND OF THE RISING SUN aka JapanGO was calling our names.  Thankfully during our walk we made reservations which paid off.  Why? because this place is so small!! my first words I uttered as soon as we entered was \"Holy S#%@ this place is small\" lol...if you get claustrophobic then this place will not be suitable as the tables are close together so dont be surprised if you're brushing shoulders with other patrons.    However I must say though this place is small, the quality, portions, and price pack a punch!! its definitely worth it! as for me Quality over quantity is the way to go!   We ended up having their California Roll, Dynamite roll, Japango signature roll (bit spicy) along with shrimp and vegetable tempura. All in all, every dish that came out exemplified freshness and quality! The presentation was bang on perfect.  Our server, who was a bit slow in getting our drinks nonetheless was nice."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here but 3 stars relative to all the other great meals I've had in Toronto.   Sushi combo, rolls, and sashimi were all quite good. The standout for me was the spicy tuna roll, which is done differently than other places and is pretty spicy! Dessert was disappointing though, seemed like ice cream you could get from a supermarket.  Service was so-so. The servers were not unfriendly but not very enthusiastic and we had to ask for them to refill our tea a couple of times."}
{"text":"I am a sushi fanatic - I get sushi cravings twice a week at a minimum. So needless to say I've tried a lot of sushi in my days.   This place is still no. 1 for me. Freshest, flavorful, most delicious melt-in-your mouth fish/seafood goodness in the heart of the city at a very affordable prices.   If you're looking for the best sushi in Toronto - look no further. This is the spot!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day for dinner with a friend and completely understood why you need reservations for dinner. The restaurant could support about maybe 15 diners at a time. It's that tiny.   That said, I will definitely return here should the occasion arise. The sushi chefs do a bang-up job with attention to detail and presentation, and the ambiance is just right for a relaxing, intimate dinner conversation.   I ordered the Spicy Tuna roll, Caterpillar roll and tried the avocado and salmon seaweed salad. Everything was delicious, and felt very authentic. Even if you do have reservations, don't expect to be completely comfortable. Tables were moved around, dishes were rearranged on the table to make more space, and service seemed a little disconnected.   I will definitely put Japango in my top ten for sushi, but I will be more likely to return for lunch.  3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"I love this place and would eat here more often if it wasn't so expensive.  It's probably one of the best places for sushi in Toronto.  The fish is amazingly fresh and you can taste the difference in their food; it's nothing like those mass produced, dime-a-dozen sushi joints that litter the streets of Toronto.  If you go, definitely get their torched tuna (don't know the official name).  It's a piece of top grade tuna sashimi, torched on one side and sprinkled with a bit of roasted garlic.  That piece of fish was like a little piece of heaven!!! You have to order it.  We also ordered unagi sushi, toro sushi, sea urchin sushi, spider role, scallop roll and sweet prawn sushi.  They were all amazingly fresh and tasted just right.    Be forewarned this place is very small, so make a reservations or take your chances.  Also be prepared to drop some serious bills for your meal - it ain't cheap sushi! This is a treat-yourself place not a daily joint!"}
{"text":"I think I've finally found an authentic Japanese sushi restaurant in Toronto! I never thought it would happen after the increasingly many korean and chinese run sushi joints I've been to. It makes me happy for many reasons:  #1: Run by friendly Japanese staff with amazing Japanese sushi chefs #2: The sushi is actually fresh, I'd lost hope of ever finding decent sushi in Toronto but Japango rekindled my hopes #3: Although a little pricy for dinner, their lunch menu is amazingly reasonable for the quality you're getting  Went there for dinner for the second time (the first time they didn't have any seating and the wait was around 10-20 minutes which didn't sit well with our hungry stomachs) and I was absolutely satisfied with everything we got. I've gotten so used to getting all these fancy rolls with complicated sauces and ingredients to hide the unfresh taste of the fish that I'm really glad I decided to go for the a la carte sushi and sashimi at Japango. We had the B.C. Tuna, Scallops, Clams, Seared Tuna, Salmon and a few others and they were all incredibly fresh and amazingly well prepared and served.  They're not on the cheap side with 2 pieces of sushi or 3 pieces of sashimi costing ~$6 but I can guarantee you won't regret it. Most other rolls (from Dynamite to Rainbow to spicy tuna) cost ~$8-10 which is pretty standard (except that at Japango they taste 10x better! No saracha sauce for the spicy sauce woohooo!) and they have great appetizers like Soft shell crab with ponzu sauce.  The place is extremely small and intimate however so make sure you're comfortable sitting shoulder to shoulder. I honestly can't say enough about this place, I almost feel like I was in a sushi place back in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I will only eat very good quality sushi, so living in Toronto, there are not that many options. Japango is amazing! Excellent value for money.  The staff is very sweet and kind, once bringing out a complimentary appetizer because they were a bit slow with the entree.  Note that this is a very tiny space, so reservations would be helpful if dining during peak times."}
{"text":"Out of all the Chirashi I've tried in Toronto so far, this place does it best.   They say you can judge a sushi chef's skill by tasting the tamago; I cannot say that I have ever enjoyed eating tamago until I had it at Japango.  Their Chirashi was perfectly put together and the different types of fish they used provided a perfect balance of clean flavours and fantastic textures.   I would definitely recommend the Chirashi and their signature Japango roll.  Be sure to make reservations, as this place is incredibly tiny and always busy. I think it can only seat around 20 people, maybe even fewer, at maximum."}
{"text":"The omakase was okay. I think for $90 per person I would rather order the other items on the menu. Service was exceptional. I love the atmosphere and would definitely be back. It is a small place so definitely call ahead to see if there is space."}
{"text":"Japango is one of my go-to restaurants in downtown.   I am always satisfied after eating here. The ingredients are very fresh. My favorite item is the japango roll. This roll may be small but very flavorful. Other items are decent too.   The restaurant is very small and it gets really busy during lunch hours. There isn't much room inside for customers who are waiting in line. Most of the time I would have to wait outside until my table is ready. If I see a queue in winter, I generally choose not to eat here since I do not want to wait outside. But other than the long wait during peak hours, I think Japango is a solid place for quality food."}
{"text":"Met a few friends here on my visit back to Toronto. This place is packed, especially for lunch on weekdays. Make sure you make a reservation.   It's tiny and quaint, unlike a lot of other japanese restaurants in Toronto. The waiter and chef are really nice.   We had the lunch bento to keep it simple, since a lot of people were waiting. The sushi, to my surprise, was very fresh and yummy. I don't normally expect good places right in the middle of downtown toronto."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. I didn't expect to have 2 great sushi meals in Toronto.  Came in half hour before closing and definitely felt rushed, as they started breaking things down, taking away my soy sauce, etc....otherwise top notch."}
{"text":"Japango is a neighbourhood favourite in the area. I recommend the chirashi don and japango roll. Must've had it 20+ times and it's consistent.  I often choose this place for fancier takeout or meet with friends. Just note it can get really crowded which makes them seat you directly against other customers. If you're looking for privacy there's none here. If you're looking for good service, also not here. That's why I almost always get takeout."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat some really good sushi. Has the atmosphere of a small sushi restaurant in Japan. The rolls are light on the rice on the outside which means you get more fish on the inside. Staff is very helpful on what is good that day. I'll be coming back for dinner, it's that good."}
{"text":"Decent food, but definitely pricey.  Service & attention lagged and this is a tiny eatery that requires a reservation in order to get seated.  I have to say, I'm a bit of a skeptic when the sushi chef tries to push a particular \"special\" fish.  I always think it's something that's going to go bad if he doesn't sell it that evening, so it is thus deemed \"special\".  I went with 2 girlfriends a few weeks ago for a 5 PM seating and 1 \"specialty\" item was Toro - now, if you like your tuna, and you like it fatty, then it's Toro for you and me.  However, I found it not very fatty - not smooth and creamy in texture and in fact, in a few pieces of \"special\" sushi's, I got a few gristly bits.  Not a fan of the gristle.  It was A-OK, but I won't be going back here and spending my hard earned cash for gristle and so-so service.  (Instead, go to the all-u-can eat sushi around the corner during lunch - that price point and quality is about the same as Japango)."}
{"text":"After seeing all these hyped reviews, we made our way here on a Tuesday lunch. The place is incredibly small - seats about 10 total. There was two server working but not much space to move around. I ordered the \"Salmon Bento\" box, which was pretty mediocre. Overall, nothing memorable, and I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"Just found a hidden dragon in downtown, love this spot. Very cozy and calm place and the food is awesome. Highly recommend to sushi lovers cause you can find fresh and tasty shshi here."}
{"text":"Japango offers high quality Japanese cuisine at a steep price and cramped restaurant. I'd definitely recommend the Chirashi bowl and Signature Roll - it was just enough to split by two and feel satisfied. Also tried the Oyster Shooter which was not worth the $8. Make sure your entire party arrives on time for your reservation, or they will give away your table within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Great sushi. All food are fresh and delicious. Good and attentive service in a small and cosy place."}
{"text":"This review is primarily for the service. The manager (possible owner) whose name was Victor I believe should not be greeting and serving customers.   My friend and I walked in and were asked if we has a reservation, which we did. He replied with you're late please stand outside. We explained that we weren't late we were in fact early. He replied with, oh 2minutes early not very early. They then didn't serve us for at least 10mins, by the time we received our food another group who had come in after us were paying and getting ready to leave.   The poor service I witnessed was directed by Victor to an older couple who he made a scene saying he wouldn't serve them. He then asked the man if he was the husband and to remove his wife from the premise. The couple had a reservation and he blatantly said he wouldn't serve them. Basically the opposite way to attract customers.   The sushi was fine, the space itself was too small, more of a pick up joint wouldn't advise to eat in.   Overall: would not recommend."}
{"text":"A tiny restaurant - make reservations before coming here!  I'd recommend:  Chef's omakase (sashimi & sushi - chef selection) THE TORO IS SO GOOD :) Very fresh, it melts!! I think they seared it a bit on the sides to give it more texture. They've also added gold flakes on top of it for a nice display. Other sashimi were delicious as well, but not as amazing as the toro..!  Japango roll: Full of flavour - it's a bit spicy. I'd recommend this too. I'm a big fan of avocado and they had huge chunks in it. That made me so happy hahaa"}
{"text":"The food was meh; very, very small portions for the price and had too much rice and too little fish. The waiter was slow and not welcoming at all. We were waiting for him to take our orders for 5 minutes; he didn't pay attention to us; a guy just walked in and he took his order right away. I guess they're more for discriminating agains non-Japanese customers.  It was an overall bad experience.  And 18% mandatory tip INCLUDED on your bill?? Seriously?! The kind of service we received truly wasn't worth that much."}
{"text":"Been here twice (once in April and once yesterday) and both times I got the chirashi lunch meal.  Fish is fresh and the meal was affordable -- what more can I say?  Came here around 1:30pm with a friend on a Friday and it wasn't packed at all.  The only downside is that it can be super cramped but the food makes up for the little discomfort in such a small place.  Will definitely come here again and maybe I'll try something else!"}
{"text":"For the overall experience of Japango, I have to give it a 3/5, but if I had to base it on food alone, I would give it a 4/5.  My boyfriend took me here for my birthday today. He made a reservation over a week ago. When we got there, the hostess/server said that they were backed up, even with reservations because other parties came earlier and he seated them. He said it would be a 5 minute wait (i knew this was not true) and we ended up waiting 30 minutes for a table. The place itself is small and cramped. We were sitting pretty close to other people and being near the door, we felt the cold breeze every time someone opened and closed the door.   I do have to say the hostess did apologize to us and gave us comp salads for our wait. He was a bit cold when I tried to ask him questions about the menu, but I chalked it up to him being super busy. I think he was the only one serving, seating, taking payment, and cleaning up after people left so he did the best he could.  Hands down, their sea urchin ($10 for about 3 pieces) and tuna belly ($23 for 3 pieces) were my fave thing on the menu. They were both so fresh. It was my first time having sea urchin on it's own (I usually have it in rice), but it tasted so fresh and amazing. I would say the quality is just as good as Japan.   Japango roll ($13 - 8 pieces) - this was okay - it was charred on top (i'm not really a fan of charred stuff), but it was flavourful. Pretty spicy though. So all you non-spicy people, watch out - you may only be able to give a few pieces before feeling the fire!  Crunchy Spicy Salmon Roll ($9 for 6 pieces) - very good - The salmon was topped with tempura pieces. The rice was so soft and just the right amount of sweetness. Totally melted in my mouth.  Chirashi Supreme ($28) - Good amount of sashimi pieces. Came with a piece of sea urchin and eel on rice. A lot of the sashimi were charred so that  I didn't like, but definitely very fresh sashimi pieces. I just wished I knew what we were eating. It's not written on the menu and the waiter was too busy to tell me what they were. It would be nice to have the pieces listed so that it could help determine if we want to other a la carte pieces.  The food came pretty quickly. Faster than we could eat - there isn't much room on the table so we felt like we had to eat quickly to accommodate the next dish.   If you are thinking of having a leisure time at this place where you can just talk and chill, think again - it's pretty much an \"eat and get out\" kind of a place since they are so small and busy. I think the max time (without stating it) is 1 hour. No dilly dallying indeed!  I would give this place a 4 if the actual dining experience was better. Maybe expanding will be an idea for the future.  For the price point, we paid $100 for two people and had 5 dishes. I think I would prefer Jabistro instead despite it being a bit more pricier. Though, I don't know if the sea urchin will be as good and reasonably priced as Japango."}
{"text":"I revisited Japango after two years, and the space and menu has not changed much. The tables are small, and you will be sitting less half a meter away from the next table.   While the deluxe nigiri sushi had a good assortment of fish, the tuna sashimi had specks of blood which the waitress said \"is perfectly fine\". This is an example of poor quality. Moreover, the fish was not as fresh as other sushi restaurants in Toronto. That being said, I did enjoy the grated wasabi that they serve.   Nonetheless, I will not be coming back to Japango for a while again as quality cannot be compromised."}
{"text":"Japango is one of my favourite sushi joints in Toronto. The sushi is fresh and their rice is superb. Some of my favourite rolls:  -dragon -rainbow  I recommend getting an assortment of the sashimi as well. The seared sashimi is amazing!  The restaurant's very cramped, there are about 7 or 8 tables I believe. The service is top notch. If you're there during peak hours, your food will come within one or two minutes of ordering, and your entire meal will be done within half an hour! Guaranteed!"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, this is one small, cramped restaurant.  Fitting 20 diners in this space is kind of like seeing how many people you can fit in an elevator at a single moment.  It was not comfortable.  It made what should have been a zen experience of sushi tasting into a madhouse.  Add screaming children into the mix and the echo reflections of the glass windows into the small space.  It was pretty bad.  The signature Japango roll is pretty good.  It is a simple california roll at its base, covered with lightly grilled salmon, sliced scallops, tobiko, and finished with an abure flame for a slight smoky flavor.  There is a lot of sauce.  I don't know if it's really worth it though because the california roll base is so normal.  I would have at least expected a dynamite roll inside.    The bento boxes, which were quite popular as I saw that nearly every table had ordered one, was one of the worst I've ever had.  I ordered the beef bento box, but I don't think it would differ much from the other bento's.  The number of dishes is small, the portion size is small, and the quality of the cooking was barely adquate.  My beef skirt steak was overcooked, past well done, chewy and tough.  I've had so many perfectly cooked small steaks at a variety of restaurants, that I was shocked to be given such a dish.  The only nice thing I can say about this steak was the grilled smoky flavor.  But the consistency of the meat, the toughness of the chew, made this a chore to eat.  I think the steak was from the previous night, and they reheated it past well done to make sure that it was safe to serve.  The salad was a joke.  Lettuce and some arugula drowned in citrus dressing.  Horrible.  The watame salad was too salty and flavorless.  Why even bother serving it when it is so bad.  The two slices of pickled daikon in the middle just added to the bizarreness of the meal.  I felt like the bento box was a thumb in the nose at their guests.  I've had better bento boxes for nearly half the price.     The service was pathetic.  The female servers were gossiping in the corner.  Tea was brought out nearly ten to fifteen minutes after I sat down, with the meal.  I got up and poured my own glass of water since it was obvious that the girls couldn't be bothered to do that for me.  It took 5 minutes to get my bill, and then another 5 minutes to get the change.  With a maximum of 20 customers, 2 servers couldn't handle it?  I've seen restaurants with 30-40 customers, and 2 servers running like mad to serve them all.   The sushi chefs wore perpetual scowls on their face.  It was like they hated being there and working there.  I hated being there and eating there.    And the cost of the meal.  Omg, I can't believe I paid so much for such a negative experience.  If this was one of the more highly rated japanese sushi places in Toronto, then I'm probably never getting sushi in this city again.    If you must eat here, order take out, but be prepared to wait an hour or more for the food."}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing, so delicious, fresh and buttery. Got the sushi dinner deluxe, japango roll (their specialty, salmon and scallop), nabeyaki udon. The udon was nothing special but great ingredients. The space is tiny, seats only about 8 tables of 2-4 people so make sure to reserve ahead of time! They also have a Queen East location in Leslieville, which is larger, but not sure if the quality of sushi is the same."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs! There are many better places to eat japanese food.  Really upset with their approach to treating customers. They hiked the price of the lunch sushi bento ($16+tax!) and didn't change their menus or provide any sort of notification anywhere about price changes. I was only told they had supposedly increased their prices AFTER I paid and checked the bill and was shocked by an almost $20 lunch! Even worse, there was no apology even though I was visibly upset.   The sushi was average and the bento was small. Especially considering I paid easily twice as much as other places nearby, this meal was NOT worth it.  I will never come back."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place.  We went again last week and their Japango roll was definitely not like before.  I don't know if they changed owners but the food in this place has gone downhill.  I was so disappointed.  Their salmon used to melt in your mouth good.  That is now gone.  Stop trying to cut corners."}
{"text":"Best sushi that I've had in Toronto so far!  Went at lunchtime around 12:15 and had to wait 10 minutes for a party of 3. The restaurant is really small, so you'll want to make a reservation for sure.   I ordered the nigiri sushi lunch bento, which comes with 10 pieces of nigiri sushi (varies according to what's fresh), comes with a bit of seaweed salad, pickled vegetables, and your typical ginger dressing salad/miso soup combination. Each piece of sushi had a unique and enjoyable flavour, and the meal left me pleasantly satisfied.   I'll definitely be coming back for more in the future!"}
{"text":"Celebration meal with my gf.  Opted for the moriawase.  Was not disappointed.  Added blue fin tuna on the side and a chirashi don. Picture says it all.  The staff was very attentive.  The only downfall is the tightness of the seats, which may also be a selling point for this shop.  It's always a full house and hard to get in!"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi spot in town! Fresh quality fish at an affordable price. The restaurant itself is tiny but cozy. Very friendly staff! There is not a lot of tables in side so try to make a reservation before.  Recommendations: Japango Roll Chirashi Don"}
{"text":"Food here is excellent. We ordered four rolls - california roll, dynamite roll, japango roll and the alaska roll (?). By far, the japango roll was the best. Quite spicy though.  Is the food worth it for the price and the experience? Probably not. Our bill ended up being $50 and we weren't even close to being full. The room is tiny and cramped and we could hear the conversation of the table next to us which wasn't very pleasant. But it is worth trying out at least once!"}
{"text":"Love the chirashi! Aside from the standard salmon and tuna, there was sweet and soft tamago, a seared white tuna (?) and 3 other types of white fish. The rice was good with a sprinkling of seeds. Also ordered a side of hamachi and mackerel which was very good and fresh.   The restaurant is very small, cramped and dim lit."}
{"text":"This could perhaps the tiniest sushi restaurant that I had ever set my foot in. Not that size is a make or break factor, I remember having to wiggle my way through the narrow passage to go to the washroom. But I must admit, the interior decor is very reminiscent of what a typical sushi bar in Japan would look like - at least in my head.   Onto the actual food! The quality of the sushi rolls are superb, but I do need to warn you that this place is not cheap. If you are famished and expecting to get full here, please be prepared to fork over your wallet. I ordered the Japango roll and it instantly melted in my mouth, the specimen was so intricately crafted and I was almost sad to see it go down so quickly. A friend of mine ordered the Black Dragon roll, which was equally impressive.  Remember to place a reservation ahead of time if possible because this restaurant does not seat a ton of people and tends to get busy during dinner time."}
{"text":"Raw fish is so fresh. And the price is fair. I also ordered volcano roll. Now, I kinda fall in Iove with this roll!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere/Service I think this place needs some redoing in how they setup their seating. It's so tightly packed in here. I'm a tiny girl and even I felt a bit claustrophobic with the seating. Throughout the whole meal, I felt rushed. The waiters kept coming over asking if we were finished even when there was still food on the plate.  Food I think it's an average sushi spot. We ordered a tuna and spicy scallop roll. Also ordered their japango roll. I do highly recommend the japango roll as it is seared and the sauce was quite unique (sort of tastes like a combination of ponzu and spicy mayo)."}
{"text":"I love Japango's sushi! However it's a small space and could be difficult to get a seat when we are a big group. However, they do delivery!  The easiest options would be the party platters. You can order based on the number of people, and they will give you a nice mix. I do find the portion slightly small. So if you are a big eater, go for the larger platters!"}
{"text":"DON'T GO TO THIS RESTAURANT! I have been a loyal customer and I loved this place. An experience completely changed my love to it.  My friend and I came here tonight for our girl's night. We both had the supreme chirashi which cost $28. I usually order the normal chirashi($21). To my surprise, the supreme one has only one more Uni which costs $7 more. After a while, one of our friend came and sat next to us. She also ordered the supreme chirashi. It was totally different from the one we had. It has more pieces,more selection and larger pieces. First, we showed the manager and asked why there were huge difference. Pictures are shown below. The manager was REALLY RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL. He first said, \"the pieces are the same but the selection vary\". Later he changed and said, \" the pieces are different but the amount are the same\". After we pointed out the obvious difference to him. He changed again and said, \"It is chef's choice, if you are lucky, you get more.\"He also said, everyone is different and this is special about our restaurant. I couldn't  believe this is an answer to customer's question from a well-trained manager!  I feel like I am a very unlucky customer to get such a dish plus the disrespectful response. All we want is just the right attitude and willing to solve customer's frustration.  If you want TERRIBLE SERVICE and BEING an unlucky customer, please go there! Otherwise, you have tons of Japanese Restaurant to choose from. Do not pay and be an unhappy,unsatisfied and unlucky customer."}
{"text":"I've been here half a dozen times and think it's one of the best value high end Japanese restaurants around. I've ordered the bento boxes, a la carte sushi, rolls, and it's all been very very good.   The place is small so I'd definitely make reservations. Japango roll is good and has a nice kick to it. I think it's been around for awhile and reasonable priced for the quality you get."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch once, and it was just terrible. The sashimi and sushi was greying and not at all fresh, and the raw oysters made me want to puke. Also, it was really pricey and the restaurant was tiny... Maybe they're only good in the evenings?"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Japango for Lunch around 2pm and was able to order off the lunch special (it ends at 2:30pm).  I got the sashimi bento and my friend got the chirashi special. I would say the chirashi special is a better deal (you get way more sashimi, and the sides for the bento wasn't amazing).  We also ordered some 4 nigiri dishes (if you are willing to splurge, I would recommend the otoro nigiri (pink belly tuna). The tuna literally melts in your mouth. ($18 for 2 pieces). We also got the uni and it was really fresh and did not taste fishy at all. The horse mackerel was decent, nothing special. The hamachi wasn't bad either. Their sashimi overall is really fresh!  One thing that did annoy a bit was that the servers were rushing to take our plates away (and it looked like they were going for their lunch break and wanted us to pay and get out). I had some food and my plate and they decided to take it away without asking if I was finished :(!  Overall, the food was good and service was quick. I would definitely go back for the otoro and uni."}
{"text":"Japango is a small cozy little place. In such a small space, similar restaurant in Tokyo often have a long, winding bar, but Japango opted for tables. This is better for person-to-person interaction, but makes getting in and out of the place a little bit more difficult.  The food is great. I had the Sashimi Dinner Deluxe and the Maguro otoro nigiri. Good portions, fresh and tasty fish.  I knew their wasabi tasted different, so I asked the chef if they use real wasabi. They DO use SOME real wasabi -  but I think they mix in fake powder wasabi, which is not as pleasant. Real wasabi is a lot less powerful and has a plant-ier texture (it's a ground-up plant stem). Note -  you do not really want to mix real wasabi with soy sauce - that's a no-no. Considering most joints here of similar price don't even bother with real wasabi, this was sort of nice.  All in all, they are much better than most of their competitors in town for the same price. Solid 4/5."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Came back for lunch--twice tried and twice disappointed. Got the japango roll, two pieces of unagi and miso soup for over $30 and found the eel to be fishy and the rice to be mushy. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I tried Japango 3-4 years ago and remember loving the food. I just had dinner there tonight and my experience wasn't the same. I felt rushed and uninvited into their restaurant. I made a reservation for 5:30pm and arrived a few minutes before my sister arrived. They would not seat me until my sister arrived. However the Caucasian guest behind me stated that he was waiting for a table for two, without a reservation and he was seated immediately. I was in shock! When we received our table, I ordered their sashimi platter, it was beautiful but tasted okay. The fish was seared and perhaps I'm a purest when it comes to fish, I like to taste the freshness of the fish. We also ordered the japango roll, tempura and seaweed salad. Perhaps the seared sushi trend was new a few years ago but tonight I found the food okay  but nothing special. This also could be due to the poor service I received which left me with a bad taste. I also noticed that everything arrived at once and we were in and out of the restaurant in 45min. This left us feeling rushed after spending a pretty penny. With so many great sushi joints around regrettably I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food here is really fresh, they take their sashimi seriously.  My chicken bento was delicious!  Wasn't the best I've had, but definitely impressive.  Place is tiny, really cramped for any table of more than 2.    Service here was really impressive.  The location is great, close to Eaton Center, Queen's Station, and all the tourist traps near downtown."}
{"text":"The sushis are good. But the quantities are really too small. I was starving when I got out of this restaurant. And it is very small, cramped, not comfortable, cold. I won't go back."}
{"text":"First off - what a horrible name.  'Japango'?  When my friend wanted to check this place out, I was hesitant that we were going to some horrible bottom-rung sushi joint.  A bottom-rung *Toronto* sushi joint.  But still - not the worst named sushi place I've eaten at... that honour belongs to 'Sushi Bang' (seriously - doesn't that just sound nasty?).  And my favourite Japanese restaurant in my hometown of Vancouver didn't have a typical Japanese name.  So, I guess why not.  Don't sure why everyone calls this place 'authentic' (as if that's a good thing).  Ya - you're not going to find a bunch of crazy rolls with monstrous steak cuts of sashimi.  They are going for something more delicate and closer to what you'll find in Japan.  With that said, most people here (despite what they claim) don't like/want 'authentic' sushi - if you planted an exact replica of a sushi restaurant in Japan in Canada - I'm sure most people would hate it.  The tastes, the portions, etc are unsettling to most Western appetites.  Most 'sushi-lovers' I know hate nigiri.  Sushi has adapted to Western tastes for good reason -- we like the huge cuts of sashimi and the avocado rolls and dipping sushi into soy sauce/wasabi mixes.  Nothing wrong with that.  I wasn't paying attention to the ethnicity of the chef/waitstaff - but I'm really not sure why other reviews are making such a huge deal of it.  There are amazing non-Japanese sushi chefs and shitty Japanese sushi chefs.  Why don't people make a huge deal about Momofuku owned by Korean and has a staff of mixed heritage?  Why don't more people make a huge deal that most 5-star European restaurants in the US are staffed mainly by Mexicans?  Your point is invalid.  With that out of that way...  We both ordered the $14 sashimi bento boxes and it was pretty solid.  The sashimi was fresh and buttery.  Good stuff.  It is very cramped.  I think it's around a 20 maximum seating capacity.  And there were 3 waiters - service was good.  Will be back for lunch as they are the closest thing I've find in Toronto that I would be interested in doing omakase at.  However, I noticed there are no seats at the sushi bar (could be a deal killer for me) -- but if this place shows consistency, I'll give them a shot down the road."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour on a weekday - thank goodness I'd called ahead to reserve a table! This restaurant is tiny and seating is quite cozy. Tables are small and do quite remind me of bars in Japan. The service is friendly if somewhat rushed. Ordered a sushi combo and a chirashi, both of which had a great selection of fresh fish. Although a little more expensive than your average Japanese restaurant, Japango offers fresh selection of fish and great craftsmanship plating each order."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here as I recall a great experience the first time. It's a small \"cosy\" little place where you don't need to bother coming unless you've made a reservation.  We ordered the Japango Roll and a Sashimi platter. The Japango Roll has to be one of my favourite rolls ever. It has a rich grilled butterfish top layer, drizzled with a sweet and a little spicy sauce and just tastes amazing. A must try. The sashimi platter was quite diverse, honestly not really sure of what fish were included. They were presented in various ways: torched, marinated, or just simply cut. The sashimi was cut generously thick.  This place is a little more expensive, and requires some forethought to ensure reservations, but is definitely worth coming to."}
{"text":"Ready for a quick taste of Japan? Go!  Fresh fish, wasabi and ginger is what it's all about. Service with a smile and a taste that will keep you smiling. The Chirashi Sushi is a great lunch deal!"}
{"text":"You are forced to order at least 2 rolls If you are just accompanying your friends to their restaurant and you only want to eat salad (because you are vegetarian) - THEY WILL ASK YOU TO LEAVE. And, you have 30  minutes time limit to finish your food and you will feel rushed to order.. The servers just don't care about their customers.. they are very rude and inconsiderate. Never EVER going there again! and the place is very very tiny and unpleasant for the price they charge."}
{"text":"WORSTED JAPANESE FOOD EVER!!! Went there for a Friday lunch. Place was crammed and noisy. Japanese waitress LITERALLY YELLED at us to 'wait outside'. Was seated in 10 minutes after another group left, I ordered lunch special - sushi , tempura and bento box. My husband had Chirashi. My sushi was given to me within 1 minute - raw fish dry and roll had grains of rice everywhere. Clearly it was premade and stacked on for a while. The tuna in my sushi and in my husbands Chirashi was the worst tuna I've ever had in my entire life - 27 years of eating Japanese food for at least 1/3 of my meals and cook Japanese at home. Strong fishy smell and taste , with the moisture from the fish gone it only made everything worse. Another group were seated beside us, heard one girl saying this place was said to be the best sushi in town. So &$;@ hilarious! Try Ja Bistro or any sushi stand in the Path - honestly MAC sushi in every mall is way better than this place.  STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"5 stars! Fresh and you get what you paid for!   The service was fast and friendly! We went around 3:00 and there was no line up and the place was empty! We ordered the sweet shrimp, blue fin tuna belly, sea urchin, crispy spicy salmon, soft shell crab, scallop sushi, and japango roll.   Everything impressed me literally! I was most impressed about the sweet shrimp. Not only was it fresh and alive, it was sweet and then they deep fried the shrimp heads and boy! was it amazing!!!  I highly recommend ordering the japango roll, it was an instant fave!!!!"}
{"text":"Third time we go $55  sushi sashimi very disappointed. I always order the same platter every time,but each time the portion is getting smaller and smaller"}
{"text":"Don't let  the size of this place fools you. Even though it's a small place, Japango has pretty good bento boxes.  Japanese Deluxe Bento ($20) - Chicken Teriyaki, 3 sushi rolls, 4 pieces of nigiri sushi, Rice, Noodle & Tempura.   For $20, this lunch bento box's a great deal. The portion's big, the flavor's not half bad. The chicken teriyaki's decent, the sushi is fresh. The tempura's pretty good as well. Another postive thing about this place: Fast service. We got our food pretty fast considering how busy it was at the time. If you're really hungry, I'd recommend trying their big bento box.        **3 1/2 stars**"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, but not the best I've had in Toronto by far. We visited on a Wednesday evening, and it was extremely packed (i.e. be prepared to creatively fold yourself out from behind tables, and good luck finding a spot for your purses and jackets). Take note: they do they reservations, so if you plan on coming here during a peak meal time, do yourself a favour and call ahead for a table. This also seems like a hot spot for take out orders - many were arriving for pickup every few minutes. Atmosphere is very casual - in the evenings, lighting is pretty dim (an FYI if you're attempting to take food pictures!).  We ordered several items: Scallops, Tempura Appetizer, Gyoza, Japango Roll (their signature roll), Crunchy Spicy Tuna, and Crunchy Spicy Salmon. Overall, everything was decent. The fish was very fresh and presented well. The  Japango Roll was probably the best item out of everything we ordered - tasty, interesting textures, bursts of flavour. I would DEFINITELY recommend this item - it was our highlight. However, while everything else tasted fine and was of decent quality, it wasn't more than average.  If I was in the area, I wouldn't mind trying this place again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. For everything, with tax and tip, for two people, I paid around $75.00."}
{"text":"I'm normally an AYCE sushi restaurant goer, but it's nice to go to a normal Japanese restaurant to try out higher quality foods. I was recommended to Japango by many friends as a good, decently priced restaurant, so I decided to give it a go.  Environment: The restaurant is located around Bay/Dundas, but it's actually to the side of a smaller street, so even though I've been around this area many many times, I've never noticed Japango. On the inside, the restaurant is SUPER TINY. They can probably only accommodate 5-6 tables at one time, and for the people who have to wait, the door doesn't have a lot of space to stand and wait, so it's better to check ahead of time. The renovation was decent though, and you could see the chefs preparing the food just steps in front of you.   Food:  I got the Chirashi Don and the sea urchin sashimi.  The Chirashi Don had a good variety of sashimi in the bowl and the Japanese rice was really soft and chewy. The sashimi was definitely fresher than the ones I normally eat at AYCE restaurants, so I'm ok with paying a higher price for my meal, for $17. The sea urchin was interesting. I've never had sea urchin before so I decided to try some here. It tasted really slimy but didn't really have much of a flavour on itself, so I don't think I would consider sea urchins to be a tasty dish. The price was quite steep at $14 for a little bit amount, so I probably won't get it in the future after I know how it tastes like.   Service: Service was alright, kinda like standard Asian restaurant service, but considering it's located downtown with many non-Asian customers, I was expecting better service. However, the service I received when I actually needed a server was good.  In conclusion, it was a nice experience going outside of my comfort zone and trying a non-AYCE Japanese restaurant once in a while. I would probably come back to try other items the next time I happen to be around the downtown area."}
{"text":"This place is great! I would come here for somewhat authentic Japanese fare when I had the funds (lived in a student residence on Chestnut street).  The atmosphere, smells and most importantly the food took me back to when I visited Japan. The sushi is great and if you'd like to try an entree i'd go with the rice dishes, the gyu-don never disappointed me.  Staff is always extra sweet. During I recall there were several teeny crabs in a cage by the sushi bar. I was smiling at them and one of the employees asked if I had ever eaten one. He then brought out a little deep fried crab for me to try (fo free! holla!). It was a nice gesture but fried up baby crab isn't really my thing."}
{"text":"I'm with Chris H.  Almost don't want people to find this place it's sooo good but sooo small!  Seating for about 20 max. in the most uncomfortable configuration imaginable.  There is about a foot of space between the tables so only the slim will be able to get through to the bench seating along the wall (also very uncomfortable)  Physical comfort aside, the sushi is simply awesome.  I wish I could name the different fish but I'm not that smart.  All I know is that they all taste incredibly fresh and melt in your mouth!  I work nearby so I'm usually there for lunch (reservations definitely recommended!) and order the lunch sushi set.  I could definitely eat a few more pieces but still a great value for the quality.  The staff is great for the most part.  Attentive and quick with your order.  My only small complaint is the lady who seems to be the owner.  She is super nice and polite to the customers but seems to be pretty harsh and loud with the other staff.  Personally I don't enjoy a meal as much when there's someone yelling over me.  It's a small detail but I think lowering the volume would improve the ambience.  On a side note, just found out that regulars can store their personal chopsticks on the wall behind the sushi chefs.  How cool is that!!!  It's like storing your cue at the pool hall, except in this case, it's very tiny cues and there are two of them ;)  No idea how to get a pair though.  I heard the late Jack Layton frequented here and had his own chopsticks..."}
{"text":"Sushi foodies, in the GTA, the buck stops here-- Japango will time and time again make your top three favorite sushi spots! Excellent freshness, flavour and presentation-- but make sure to reserve and advance-- there's less than 30 places so walk ins, especially on weekend evenings, are not an option!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5/5 We ordered salmon carpaccio, chirashi, eel and avocado roll and japango roll. Everything was good, but nothing outstanding. For the price and the reviews here, I was expecting more. Note that the place was quite cramped but the speed at which our food came out was crazy fast."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and the sashimi dinner was amazing. Excellent service! It's a very small place so I suggest having a reservation or else you'll be waiting for awhile."}
{"text":"top quality cuts of fish, probably best sushi restaurant in Toronto. Only reason why they lose a star is the space is small and inconvenient, really makes the dining experience very uncomfortable. Prices are on the high end so be prepared to spend more than usual for your lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for their lunch sushi bento for 4 years. For the past two visit, food is not as good as before, the fish was dry and their japango roll was too spicy. The service is not attended. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I'll admit I didn't pick the restaurant nor did I want to go when we arrived, I was wrong to judge before dining.  This is one of the best sushi / Japanese restaurants I have ever eaten at.  It is tiny, counted 20 seats.  Everything was delicious. Gyoza, miso, Katsura, sushi, even the tea was wonderful.  Highly recommend, call ahead for seats, remember I only counted 20 seats."}
{"text":"The place is small and crowded. Service is great and the sushi lunch was very fresh and served quickly. Chef's choice - all good. We got our miso soup almost immediately and the lunch followed soon after. I wish the water was with ice. But other than that the food was great - price good and quick."}
{"text":"This place used to be 5-star until the new ownership (I'm almost sure there's been new ownership that coincided with the new menus... and higher prices).  The food even justified the high prices. Now... not so much."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and it was just okay. Just meh.   We came right at noon and snagged the last table. I don't like how close everyone sits to each other and I felt like I had to lower my voice so others wouldn't listen to my conversation.  It didn't help that the restaurant started blasting EDM either.   We ordered a dragon roll,  chicken bento,  eggplant appetizer and unagi donburi. To be honest, nothing really blew me away. It tasted like any other Japanese restaurant and today, we paid slightly more. Yeah I know I didn't order raw fish but I guess if you don't order that, then you're not getting great food anyways.   Come here if you're strictly into sashimi and fancier cuts of fish. For anything else,  just go to Kyoto or anywhere else."}
{"text":"So I've been consistently ordering delivery from here for the past few weeks and I am definitely a fan of the food. Today, I decided that i'd make the trek to the actual restaurant and try the food fresh from the kitchen.  The food was great, as ever, I had the Chirashi supreme for $28. It was beautifully presented, there were pieces of lightly seared butterfish, yellowtail, salmon sahimi and toro as well as a few I wasn't too familiar with, the owner of the restaurant (manager I'm not sure) was a little cold so I wasn't really too willing to ask what the pieces of mystery fish were, though they were really delicious.  The service is the reason why Japango is only getting 4 stars instead of 5. I understand that yea I'm dressed like a student, casual American eagle shirt and shorts as well as 20kg backpack so perhaps my meal isn't going to add to your fortune immensely. Yet I feel like completely ignoring my gratitude when I say thank you and bringing me the cheque right after I'm done eating with no one waiting outside was a little bit extreme. Nonetheless I still tipped 5$ for the sake of the other poor waiter there. Also the seats were really cramped though I was ready for that.   Tl;dr great sashimi, mediocre service if you don't look like a hotshot businessman, cramped seats 4 stars, guess I'll be ordering takeout from now on so I don't have to tip :P"}
{"text":"Much like the other reviews, this place is ok but not great. The quotes in the menu on how great this place is date back 10 - 12 years. I think not much has changed since then....literally. \"Hole in the wall\"?, yes, but not the type that makes you want to keep coming back.  The $17 Sushi lunch bento was lacking in presentation and substance. While the price was reasonable the nigiri were very small. I ordered it at 2:00 pm and it was ready in 3 minutes. I don't know how that's possible other than having some pieces cut. The sticky rice was wet and not that \"sticky\".  The menu itself has the full array of nigiri and sashimi but lacking in maki rolls. There are actually very little in the way of specialty rolls. The lunch specials are OK and the dinner specials are expensive. But overall the price seems fair for the location.  The place has seating for about 16 people. The tables are old and squeaky and although it does feel like an authentic Tokyo sushi restaurant, we are in Toronto and there's no need to be cramped and uncomfortable. If the quality of the sushi was better, you might put up with it.  If I'm ever in this area again, I would definitely go around the corner to Yutaka which has a better environment and better value."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING!! The Japango roll is one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had.  I love that you can see them making all the food, especially when they use the blowtorch.  It is pricier than most places, but it is completely worth the money you spend. One complaint I would have is the lack of space (the only reason I didn't give Japango 5 stars). There's only seating for about 15 people or so, and you should be prepared to cozy up to strangers.  They do have another location in the beaches area that I have yet to try.  All in all, amazing food. Worth the money. VERY cozy. Would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I did the omakase here recently...and it was spectacular. More than a few people have written about the omakase already, so there's no need for me to repeat it...though I will say, I think the price of the omakase here is pretty reasonable for the number of dishes and the quality that it came with. I've been here in the past for the omakase and while I thought it was good in the past, I thought it was especially good recently...not sure why though...  What I will talk about with respect to my recent omakase experience here was that the dessert had black sesame ice cream that was FANTASTIC. I had black sesame at Kekou, and I had black sesame ice cream at other places in town, but Japango's black sesame ice cream is worth the visit alone....so much so that me and a friend (who had separately gone to Japango for omakase and developed a craze for the black sesame ice cream) have come here twice since I came here for omakase just to order the ice cream for take out. Sure it's a little pricy, but it's so worth it!! =)  One thing to note about visiting Japango...it's a very small shop. If you're lucky, you'll get here when there's an empty table. If not, you might be standing either in a very cramp entrance space, or outside just to have more space while you wait for a table...in my experience though, it's worth the wait. I've never had a bad experience here. Regardless of whether it's a la carte or omakase, it's always been good here."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received. Server was rude. Told me I wasn't allowed to order anymore because i had ordered too much and tried to pry the menu from my hands. Food was mediocre and not worth the cramped space."}
{"text":"Love their nabe yaki udon! Chirashi don is fresh and nicely presented.The anago sushi contains whole piece of eel, however it is a bit dry for me."}
{"text":"The sushi here is probably one of the best places in Toronto. Great attention to detail. However, the lineups can be quite long and the seating quite squished. The place is tiny and they basically try to sit as many people in there as possible. Great food though, service is just average"}
{"text":"This is a 4.5 star rating and the only reason there was a half star docked is because the place is very small and when we get takeout, there's really no room to stand unless you're the only person there. We've been getting takeout from here a few times the past month and we can't get enough. We usually get a mixture of items and so far I've tried the chirashi supreme, sushi deluxe, the japango roll and a lot of the a la carte items as well. The chirashi supreme ($28) had some fish that I didn't really like so I only ordered that once. If you're not really opposed to a lot of fish, the chirashi is a good way to get a mix of things and pretty good value as well. The sushi deluxe dinner comes with 12 piece of nigiri, tempura roll, as well as soup and salad for $30. We've gotten this a few times and the fish is always delicious. There's usually salmon, tuna, scallop, and whatever is fresh - the torched sea bream is one of my favourites. I tried the japango roll because I read all the reviews about it and how people raved. Don't get me wrong, it was good but it was so teeny tiny for $13, I don't think it was worth it. I would rather get some a la carte nigiri which I think is the best way to enjoy sushi if you have the money for it. They're unagi nigiri ($8 for 2 pieces) is amazing. Trust me, just order it and you will be amazed. First off, it's a gigantic piece of eel and you can tell that it's not the crappy frozen kind you get at a supermarket. We get at least 3 orders of it every time. The otoro ($16 for 2 pieces of nigiri) is always delicious and you really only need 1 order because it's so rich. We also love the ikura and scallop. I tried the uni before too and it's definitely different than uni in other places. Very fresh stuff every time and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Try to describe sushi without using the words: fresh and buttery and \"melts in your mouth\" . It's not easy but tonight's meal certainly opened my eyes in the world of higher quality sushi. This is the complete opposite of the mentality of the Kyoto sushi buffet house next door.   My mentality before japango consists of getting the best price to quality ratio enough to fill me up. I thought that all sushi beyond the regular supermarket prepackaged sushi was \"good enough\"  for me. Good thing I was wrong.   The deluxe sushi combo ($30) that came was plated very nicely with assorted decorations such as chrysanthemum flowers, thinly sliced limes and a wide variety of sushis. Aside from the salmon and tuna, each of these sushi have their own specific cut and delicate yet bold flavours on top of a lightly cooled tangy sweet rice which I really loved.  The ratio between the amount of fish to rice ratio is perfect. They definitely weren't trying to skimping out on the thickness of each sushi.   This was an eye opening sushi experience for me and I am eager to try out other higher end sushi places now. To me this was a fair price.   Unfortunately I have to take out a star due to the format and layout of the store. I was stationed less than half a meter away from the open door on a cold January night. Which means I ate my dinner in my winter jacket.   Anyhow keep it up japango! Would come again!"}
{"text":"1) Amazing food - For the quality of food that you get, the price was definately worth it 2) Great service - Servers are friendly, and always check up on you 3) Authentic/Romantic ambience"}
{"text":"Japango is a hidden gem located a few minutes away form the heart of all the insanity in downtown but don't let it's quaint location fool you!  The moment you go in, you realize all the cool kids are there waiting to get a spot in this coveted sushi spot.   Their sashimi set is definitely one to enjoy especially given the limited options of quick, high quality sushi/sashimi in Toronto.  Their rolls also looked equally delicious and something that I'm going to try in the future.    All in all, this is a awesome place to go to for quick, no nonsense sushi.  Is is mind blowing - not quite but really, you should still go try it!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sushi restaurants in the city that won't totally break your bank.  Japango is a small sushi joint on Elizabeth Street just south of Dundas...and when I say small, I mean small. I arrived here on a Thursday hoping to eat in for lunch, but the place was already full by 11:45am. I opted to wait for a few minutes, but eventually the employees told me to order take out cause they thought a table wouldn't open up for a while.  I went with the sushi bento for take out, which came with a soup and salad. I can definitely see where the hype came from to start, because it was definitely of a higher quality than many other places I've been to. The sushi was also very unique and high quality, with some pieces torched. For $14, it's certainly a good deal, and is comparable to Wow Sushi up near Yorkville, which also serves excellent sushi for lunch.  Back to the service...eventually a table opened up right after I ordered, and I requested the servers to allow me to dine in. Unfortunately they didn't allow me to sit, and opted to sit the person (also a walk-in) waiting behind me. I honestly felt a bit disappointed cause they knew my original intent was to dine in.  While the food was 5-star quality, the disappointing service I experienced drops this rating to 4-stars. Perhaps a dine-in experience would change this rating, because I was honestly very impressed with this place!"}
{"text":"What a highly rated restaurant! The number of awards peppering Japango is quite insane. On a rainy afternoon, the restaurant was fully packed with customers, but after the lunch hour rush the location was deserted.  The menu is laid out in a clean and simple format, and service is extremely efficient. They give you TEA, not water, which is very rare in Toronto. Price was a bit expensive but the lunch specials are fair. I'm fond of Japango and I would definitely come back!   Favorites: Sashimi don- SO delicious! You get a bowl of spicy sauce to drizzle over your don, and the beautiful mix of sliced raw fish and steaming white rice is pefection.  Dislikes: Salmon teriyaki lunch. It's a bunch of pre-bought side dishes with a quickly grilled salmon that is drenched in teriyaki sauce. I could make this at home!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place is just way too overpriced. I understand the food are fresh and nice. But that does not make me want to give it 5 stars.  The place cost me $31 for 15 sashimi, one small bowl of rice, and a bowl of miso soup that has no tofu in it. It's just too expensive. People voted so high for this place is mostly because of the quality.  I will choose AYCE over this place. The problem isn't the quality or the service.   If your paying $31 for a dinner but the food don't fill you. What's the point ? It is better to spend that $31 for a sushi dinner buffet or 3 days of McDonalds."}
{"text":"Came here on Mother's Day without making a reservation. Ordered the Chirashi, which was excellent! Ate half of it and got full, so I ended up taking the rest home. Although the restaurant was small in size and could only fit around 20 people, the food and service was amazing. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Found this place overrated. The restaurant itself is extremely small, with very tight (and quite frankly uncomfortable) seating. You could barely turn around while we stood and waited for our seats.   The menu mainly is quite a bit of variety. We opted for the following:   Chirashi Supreme - this was filled with fresh and generous portions of various types of sashimi and rice on the side.   Japango roll - the signature roll, was tasty with very unique flavours. Not the best roll I've had but I'd recommend this if you're here.  Fried tofu and Soft Shell crab - both these dishes I found  standard with nothing to stand out.  Overall good is good but I don't think it justifies the hype and pricing. Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Toronto. My wife and I are particularly fond of the King Salmon Sashimi (I think King Salmon is fattier and more flavorful than regular salmon) and the Japango Rolls. The staff are very polite and knowledgable. The restaurant is very small (relative to its popularity) so expect to be seated only a couple feet away from another party...this gives the restaurant a more intimate feel, but can sometimes be annoying. Regardless, this remains our \"go to\" Toronto sushi destination."}
{"text":"I've made it my goal to try all the purported gems of Japanese restos in Toronto.  Japango has been on my list for a while, and one spontaneous Friday night we decided to go.  Wait was only maybe 20min (made a reservation but was unfashionably half an hour late, so.. we deserved that) I was kept company by the green monkey by the door and I was not discontent during my wait.  Watched the little crabs by the counter too, they cute.  Anyhow, I got the chirashi dinner bowl and my friend got the regular sushi dinner.  The difference?  ...not sure, except my rice was with the sashimi and the sushi dinner had it separated.  I'm assuming seasoning and everything is the same, but the fish variety did differ slightly in the two dishes.    Extremely fresh.  Seems to be quality cuts.  Service very fast, and that Japango roll we decided to share is one of the most flavourful rolls I had.  I don't wanna ruin the surprise by listing the ingredients but try a bite of that when you pay Japango a visit, won't regret.  Tiny resto, pretty much a small box and probably mimicks the feel of the restos in Japan.  Can easily see the chefs blowtorching culinary stunts and diligently prepping away.  Would come back for omakase when there's a special occasion, big thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"So they had some decent sushi but not worth the price and when it came time for the bill we noticed a discrepancy between what they had on the bill vs the menu and when we brought it to their attention, they said, \"oh the prices have changed\". Which is all well and good but they can't just arbitrarily say that.... when we said, \"cool, but I'll just pay what the menu says\" they manager looked angry at us!    Not cool Japango, not cool."}
{"text":"I'm in love. Super tiny place hosting 5 to 6 tables max at one time. Authentic flavors, great quality, unpretentious, efficient; can't wait to return and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Nothing but the freshest sashimi that I ever tasted....flavors were so distinct and u could really taste the seafoodness...not a really big menu but it's good quality stuff...it's a really small restaurant that has about 7-8 tables....I also recommend the fried crab that's an appetizer"}
{"text":"Terrific for sushi and sashimi. Awesome variety of fish and seafood, many pieces I haven't seen often or done as well. Space is small, but worth it for the food. Probably best to make a reservation. I didn't find the rolls too great, but why would you order them with the selection available? :-) must eat."}
{"text":"Best sushi I had in Toronto. The salads specially the once with tuna and avocado. (Guess called tuna tartar) are amazing.  The place give me the feeling that i am in Japan; small an cozy. You should enjoy sitting really close to others and from time to time share your conversation. A truly happy place. The service is polite and friendly. Make sure you reserve in advance though."}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good and fresh. The place is small though so you should make a reservation. I really liked sushi 2 because they gave us a few different kinds of sushi to try. If you don't like Wasabi then tell them to take it out because they put Wasabi under all the sushi."}
{"text":"I'm quite new to sushi, but I like Japango every once in a while.  The ingredients are very fresh, I have only ever gotten take away from here so can't comment on the dining experience.  I really can not fault the food, which is why I gave 4 stars.  It is kind of pricey especially if you want a selection.  Be nice if they did little combo boxes with sushi rolls, tempura etc..   Not any pricier than any other sushi restaurant however, I just find it somewhat overpriced in general.  But if you like sushi, this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, talented chief, awesome service and great pricing! Perfect for party under four."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the city.   Just a slight problem with the service, seating, wait time and decor.   And a bit pricier."}
{"text":"I am so in love with this place! I would say it is a hidden gem and quite small so prepared to get cozy. Honestly, I haven't been able to look and taste sushi in the same way after my trip to Japan but Japango really met my expectations. The nigiri set offered a plethora of fish of the day to try. The quality and price is well worth. Will be coming back again for more!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the freshest sashimi I've had in town. I came off hour for lunch service, got seated quickly. Ordered a lunch sushi special ($15 plus I added $2 to change the California rolls to salmon avocado roll) and an order of Japanese uni ($25 per order), which the server's recommendation over the Boston uni. 10 pieces of some very fresh sushi later, I was a happy camper! I'd be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went to Toronto for a weekend and my cousin recommends this restaurant highly, called to book a table and everything went smoothly  Seating area was small and cramped but understandable since its downtown  I saw some reviews about the server being rude, for a second I did felt he was being a bit passive aggressive as he stopped taking my order half way and told me that he will come back when we are decided (he was jumping between tables and delivering food to tables and answering phones) for a second I thought I was back in NYC, but he did put in a partial order of stuff that we ordered, and being that it was my first time there I was a bit hesitant (we ordered the Uni and seafood udon for my son first) when the Uni came I realized I was in the right spot  Food came fast and nicely presented, we even got a freebie along with the meal, it's not a fancy restaurant but the food certainly exceeds my expectation."}
{"text":"Pros: Well made sushi  Cons: Portions could be better Small location  I was off one day during the week and met up with my GF for lunch here.  I've heard a lot of things about Japango in the past so I came in with some expectations.    Let's get this out of the way first, this place is SMALL.  There's about 5 tables cramped together and one more for a single person right by the door.  This place seats about 15 people max.  It's not the most comfortable seating either.  There really isn't much space to move around at all.  You're coming here basically to have a quick meal and get out.  This is not a place you'll come for a relaxing meal followed by a chat of any sort.  Having said that, this is a really nice place to get sushi.  It's all really well made here.  We had the salmon teriyaki lunch specials which came out super fast, well presented and tasted very well.  I would of liked a bigger portion, but that's just the big eater in me talking.  I had to order an extra spicy salmon roll to make up for it.  The spicy salmon roll was, get this, ACTUALLY SPICY!!  It was pretty darn spicy as well, gave me quite a surprise.   We were in and out in about 30 minutes.  All in all, I would definitely come back for lunch here.  I might not come for a dinner because I want a more relaxed setting.  If you need a quick Japanese lunch downtown, this is a place you should definitely check out."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews from friends who have eaten here before, I'm sure the food is great. However, the service that I received last week was absolutely pathetic and I've never been more upset at a restaurant BEFORE even having dined here.   Here goes my long rant.   My friend and I walked in around 6pm on a weekday hoping to get a table for 3. The place was packed so we asked one of the servers (man in his 50s)  how long of a wait it would be for a table of 3, to which he replied in a condescending manner that he can't tell us unless our entire party was here. At this point we're like okay... usually restaurants don't seat you unless your entire party is here but to not even give us an estimated wait time? We then sat in the two chairs near the door to wait for our friend. During this time, one of their customers (or possibly a delivery driver) came in to pick up an order and this same server told him to close the door and wait outside because they were still packing their order (there was more than enough room for the guy to wait inside). At this point our  friend arrived and we again asked him how long it would take for a table. He then asked us whether we had a reservation, to which we replied no. He then kind of sneered and told us that he can't seat us. The way he said it was more like a \"how DARE you come here without a reservation?\" All 3 of us were just shocked by how rude and stuck up this guy was and left immediately. As we headed out, we bumped into the guy with the takeout order and he shouted out that this place treats their customers like dirt. I'm sure they have other nicer servers but I've never met a more arrogant and disrespectful server as this guy. I will never go back there again and will be taking my business to Saku on Queen W. Not sure who this guy thinks he is but there are plenty of better options in downtown who actually treat their customers with respect."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I visit this city occasionally for biz-ness so I was so glad to find this sushi spot close to our office.  It's exactly the kind of small, authentic Japanese place I'd frequent back home in SF.  I was really impressed by the quality of the fish. I didn't have high expectations for sushi in Toronto. I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious and fresh sushi and sashimi. I've been here for lunch in the past and this is my first time here for dinner. It was delicious. We ordered the chefs platter ($55) and 2 Japango rolls. Loved the scallop on the rolls, the spicy mayo was a nice touch. Of course this place is kinda pricey to me as I'm used to $10-$20 sashimi dishes but you pay for the quality of the food.   I wasn't too fond of the service but overall the food bumps my experience up. Definitely make reservations!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a girlfriend during the weekday lunch hour; we had made reservations as Japango is a very tiny and seating is very limited, probably maximum of 25 people.  We ordered 2 chirashi's ($16 each) and a Japango roll ($13).. it was delicious! You are also served a small bowl of salad/miso soup to start.The fish was by far the best I've ever tasted in Toronto and at a very reasonable price too. I could taste the vinegar in the rice which I loved.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever...Do finish ur lunch in one hour otherwise u get kicked out. It's the \"culture\" here."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and my boyfriend and I drive to Toronto mainly because we enjoy the food here and Japango is definitely one of my favorite sushi places. It could be a little pricey but the sushi is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"On a recommendation from a friend I walk here for dinner while on business in Toronto. Tucked on a quiet street (rare) right behind city hall you realize right away that this hallway of a tiny restaurant is exactly what you were looking for. The service was extremely prompt and precise. There was one waiter watching 7 or 8 tables (all of them) and he never let an empty bowl sit for more that 2 seconds or my tea cup be less than half full.  Truly exceptional service.  Now the food. When you see soft shell crab on a menu you have to go for that. Cooked crisp yet soft and steaming hot, great flavour balance.  Seaweed salad was refreshing with great balance of seasoning. I had the chirashi deluxe sashimi and there was a great assortment of seafood, the egg was sweet with great texture and the rice was perfectly seasoned with mushrooms and fish eggs for amazing texture.  I will be back on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with Lauren and her review tells it like it is. The food here is good but not great; it's hard to relax and enjoy a meal when I can't warm up since the place is so tiny and the door is kept open by the people waiting to sit down.   The service here was good but food was brought to us in a haphazard fashion, so don't expect to eat your meal in any particular order. I might come back here to try the sashimi but I would not wait in line."}
{"text":"For some reason, it was difficult for me to get a 'feel' for this place during lunch.  Maybe it's because it was a lunch and therefore didn't order a whack loada food OR stay all that long to properly assess.  The Order: -  Sushi 1 (8 nigiri/6 cali) - $15 -  spicy salmon roll - $8 -  salmon/avocado roll - $7  The Good: -  nice variety of fish, some of which wouldn't normally be offered at a sushi place, for lunch nevertheless -  proper presentation, not slopped together on a plate -  fresh -  they make their own wasabi -  meal came with complimentary miso soup -  tea was refilled without asking -  server was sweet and friendly  The Not-So-Good -  the place is small/tight, so limited seating, maybe fits 20ppl max, not ideal for groups -  tables are small, so you basically hafta finish/divide what's on the serving plate before another plate arrives -  the complimentary salad never came with our meal, even though it's stated in the menu.  We asked the waitress about it, had to repeat ourselves, she asked another worker, and she responded, \"No\".  She was very sweet tho', so no harm done -  depending on who serves you, their English may not be fluent  Overall, I'd visit again and wouldn't hesitate to eat there again!"}
{"text":"It's small, cramped, and the service is spotty when things are busy.  If you have ever eaten sushi in Japan, this is exactly what the good places are like.  And this is a very good place. One of the best in the city. Fresh, expertly prepared and presented, rice cooked and vinegared to perfection. Tastes (and feels) like the real thing.  If you want cheap and spacious go enjoy one of the 100 Korean/Chinese-run spots that are everywhere you point your feet in Toronto."}
{"text":"They are supposed to be open till 10:30pm and we got there at 9:45 and they wouldn't serve us because they said their kitchen is closed!!"}
{"text":"Cozy little place... too little in my opinion. When we arrived, we were told to wait for a table which was no problem. The only thing was that there's almost no space, not even space to stand and wait. I felt extremely claustrophobic in there.   It didn't get any better when we sat down either. Imaging sitting near the entry, trying to enjoy your food, while a person waiting for their table is standing not even further than 2 inches from you. Maybe I have personal space issues, but I was very uncomfortable.   The food was amazing, so I guess it makes up for the lack of space. We got their specialty roll - Japango Roll, which was mouth watering delicious. I love salmon that is slightly torched at the top of sushi, and it really hit the spot for me. Overall, the price was very reasonable and the server was sweet as well. I do recommend this place, but perhaps take out and eating at the comfort of your own home would be better."}
{"text":"Tiny restaurant that you can barely move but the quality of the sushi fish was excellent. Rice could be a little warmer to make it perfect."}
{"text":"4.5/5  *Service isn't that good as there was only one server in the restaurant.  *I don't recommend going here with a big group as the restaurant is extremely cramped.   -Live Uni - $25 I'm an uni fanatic and this was the best I've had in Toronto so far. The uni was amazingly fresh and creamy, had a slight taste of the sea and was not fishy at all.  -Botan Shrimp Nigiri - $9 for 2 nigiri Not only the shrimp was fresh and slightly sweet, the chef also deep fried the shrimp heads and boy, was it amazing!!  -Horse Mackerel Nigiri - $8 for 2 Nigiri The Aji didn't have a strong fishy taste and had a mild oily texture. The fish was served with fresh grated ginger and scallions to counteract the fishy taste and left a light aftertaste on the palate.  -Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi - $8 for 2 nigiri  The fact that it was seared helped to elevate the taste and richness in the fish oil. The torch increased the temperature and slightly changed the texture of the scallop yet it was not too firm nor overcooked  -Bluefin Tuna Belly Nigiri - $16 The bluefin tuna belly was pricey ($16) for two pieces, but I'd say try it once if you're looking to splurge. Since the fish was seared, it released all the fatty oils which gave the fish a buttery and melts in your mouth goodness...  -Spider Roll - $11 The spider roll was much smaller than the ones I had at other restaurants and had a different taste, more delicate, refined and less batter.  -Japango Roll - $13 The Japango roll is a California roll topped with seared salmon and scallop drizzled in their special sauce and spicy oil. If you don't know what to order at the restaurant, I highly recommend this roll! The special sauce was sweet and tasted a little like Teriyaki sauce and went very well with the fish oil that came out from the salmon after seared. With a hint of spiciness, the sauce was not as overwhelmed as it would be on its own."}
{"text":"You do not want to come here for dinner if there are only 2 people.   The place is really small, no extra space for waiting except the tiny area at the front door. We arrived 5 minutes before the reservation and got told we are early. Yes, I can see all the tables are occupied, but I don't see anyone would like to control their walking speed to the restaurant just to get there at perfect time. Another table of customers have to wait outside in the -20 cold because there is no space for them inside. And there is not enough heating inside too.  It took about 10 minutes for us to decide ordering some sushi, vege starter and rice dishes. Guess what, they all get served within 5 minutes time. and there is no space on their tiny table(if only 2 of you, you will be seated at small table for 2) to keep all these plates. The food portion is standard, we did not order huge amount of food, basically everything got server on 2 sushi dishes and one rice bowl. You can image how tiny the table is.  Because they rushed to serve everything, it only took us about 20 minutes to finish all these food so the total time we were in that place is ONLY HALF HOUR for DINNER.  After we finished all of food, without asking, the asian man seems like a manager has already gave us the bill when he came to collect all the empty plates, even we have not decided whether we are going to order more food or dessert, and they don't have dessert even it says on their menu. So I get his message, ASKING US TO GET OUT and free the table for other customers. I politely asked for the credit card machine, he knocked his head but never returned.  The food was OK, average; but the service was bad.  This is just my experience at this place because it got a high review score from somewhere else.  I noticed the place most likely is a korean sushi bar instead of japanese and I checked the photos people posted before on yelp, I don't recognize any of them were in the restaurant, so I guess they have new owner at some stage."}
{"text":"It really doesn't make sense that this tiny cramped restaurant with overpriced menu items is considered the best sushi in Toronto. I've definitely had better sushi in Toronto. It is fresh - but the dining area is so uncomfortable and small, it makes for a terrible dining experience. The maki rolls are TINY. If you order a drink, they bring it to you in the frikkin can itself. I'm not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Awesome place! On the small side that seats around 5 tables so there can be a wait.  Pricing a little on the steep side but well worth it. Food is delicious and presented well.  Service is humble and awesome.  I usually end up ordering a bento box or their sashimi.  Quality is always up there though I admit, this is not my go to place. Highly recommend overall.  Atmosphere 3 Food 4.75/5 Service 4/5"}
{"text":"My top 3 places to go for Japanese in Toronto! It might be a tie between the other Japanese restaurant that I always rave about - Yuzu No Hana.   The menu and the high quality of the food is similar/identical to Yuzu No Hana. Yuzu has a much bigger restaurant space, and Japango is significanly smaller and more congested. Japango's service is superb compared to Yuzu, which is average for such a nice restaurant.   There are many sushi/sashimi places in downtown Toronto and GTA, but it's rare to find places that dont cut corners to make more money off their fish. I'm in love with the Sashimi dinner here; they serve it with different sashimis every time I visited, but it came with butterfish every time...and their butterfish makes me go back on a regular basis - it almost melts in your mouth.  If you are an Uni lover like me, Japango has some fresh Uni!  Street parking available. Recommend going early because sometimes the street is fully parked. I've seen people getting tickets so make sure to pay for your parking. Also, make reservations because this place is popular but tiny!"}
{"text":"I went there with my wife recently.  We tried their sashimi and sushi.  We are frequent diners at Zen so thats our point of comparison and we were pleasantly impressed by the quality of the fish at Japango. Overall price point is great and food is good, better in pricing and quality compared to Jabistro.  However we only gave it three stars due to the service. We were rushed through our meal.Even though I haven't finished my drink yet the waiter kept rushing me to get out to get our table.  It was almost hostile.  If you're looking for fast food like experience with poor service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I've always heard pretty good things about this place, and decided to finally try it out. Definitely did not live up to my expectations. I've had much better sushi for same or lower price. I got the Lunch 2 special with the 12 piece sushi (chef's choice) with a roll and miso soup. This was on a weekend and ran me a total of ~27.  The restaurant itself is also tiny, can fit maybe a total of 20 people."}
{"text":"The vegetable udon is excellent, as is the soft shell crab, the tempura, and the gyoza. The sushi was fresh and well prepared. The japango roll itself was a delicious mix of bold flavors. The service was great and the prices were reasonable. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Terrible place for reservation and dining. Horrible service. My friends and I had this reservation from 1pm for a birthday lunch, only 45 minutes after, the lady who seems like owner/manager of Japango told us to finish our meal ASAP, because it's lunch time and there are other customers waiting. She said \"THIS IS THE CULTURE HERE! LUNCH IS ONLY ONE HOUR.\" Firstly, she was very rude and used finger pointing to customers; Secondly, there was no one refilling our tea at all during the entire 45 mins. I am very disappointed at this place, no matter how good fresh their food are, I'd never ever come back!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a zero star option. I don't usually write reviews but the attitude I got from the guy (might be the manager) who greeted was some NEXT LEVEL customer service.  Doesn't matter how good your food is, please show some respect to the people who come to your restaurant."}
{"text":"Very very small place, cozy I guess as long as you can get seats.  we went here after looking at Yelp reviews but I was bit disappointed.  We ordered oyster (they were a O-K), sashimi deluxe (fresh yes, and good but not the best I have had), Japango roll (probably the best thing I had the whole night..nothing to die for though), Dynamite, rainbow, eel rolls were small, very plain, not really worth $10/roll  Pretty good service, nothing to complain about.  The bottom line is that three of us went there and our bill came out to $96 (before tip) and we were still hungry that we ended up going to get some noodles across the street after...never had to do that before.  Would I go back? Not by choice..l mean it is lot better than the other all you can eat sushi place just down the street but it didn't hit the spot."}
{"text":"A Japanese foodie I trust recommended this place as a good sushi restaurant that is affordable. I went there on my own and am glad I made the effort to check out the place. I had very fresh uni (sea urchin), hotate (scallops) and botan shrimp, among others. Service was good and he was very kind even though they had a reservation soon after my seating. The place is definitely small so I would recommend making a reservation. Prices range from under $20 (dinner set) to $100 for an omakase dinner."}
{"text":"Had the chirashi supreme and shared the ootoro sushi as well as the japango starter.  - Japango starter was pretty standard, though the salad was much better than what I'm used to at Japanese places - Chirashi supreme was very good overall but one of the fish they chose to put in there was kind of slimy... not a fan (though I'll acknowledge that it may just be a personal preference thing). - The ootoro was too greasy/oily, I've had much better and wouldn't pay $8 for another piece (you pay $16 for two pieces). They served it on a massive plate and sprinkled gold flakes on it too, which I thought was a bit much.  Tables were very small and I felt a bit cramped. I don't understand why the ootoro came on such a big plate (the sushi covered about 5% of the plate) when the table was already short on space. Also, the place was quite busy so service was slow and not particularly attentive. Took me a few minutes to get the bill.   The food is much better than what you'd find at your average sushi joint, but I won't go back for a while."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the people who are raving about this place.  Yes, it USED to be good.  Nasty staff (get you in and out as quickly as they can), average sashimi and sushi.  Fish is fresh but have had better cut and prepared sushi.  The adjumma at the cash desk is friendly enough.  The Korean gochuchang was way too strong for a hwae-dup-bap (sashimi don) and needed more vinegar.  The salad greens prior to the mains were wilting with rusty pieces of lettuce.  Thought I left my sunglasses in there one day and they were MEAN when I went back to see if I left them there.  I shall not be back.  There are many more sushi-yas in Toronto where I can go (thankfully); are they actually Japanese?  I speak with them in Korean ... I remember when this place first opened and they were truly incredible.  I don't know what has happened in the interim ..."}
{"text":"We did a lot of shopping at the Eaton Centre Mall during a boxing day weekend and wanted to have sushi for lunch. Japango was the best rated place in the area, so we automatically wanted to get our sushi fix there. Upon arriving at the place we looked through the window and saw that this place was crowded. We really had way too many shopping bags and decided to pass on this place and maybe come back some other day.  We came back to this place on another weekend afternoon and were pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't a full house, maybe a couple of tables were seated with guests (which is like half of the restaurant). This place seems like a regular spot for university students. When we entered the restaurant the sushi chefs greeted us in some Japanese, Irasshaimase. But I immediately noticed later on that everyone in the back was speaking Korean. I kind of have a problem with the restaurant name calling itself \"Japango\" when the staff themselves are not Japanese.  I looked around and thought to my self, this place looks real small.  There was barely any space to walk in-between tables. We got ourselves seated somewhere in the middle of the restaurant, across from the sushi bar. The table we were seated at was old and rickety...the table kept moving whenever our arms were leaning on either side.  We were given menus and we found it extremely difficult to read them. The font setting was small, and the restaurant was so dark when it was still bright outside. Our table had a small electric lamp thing, but it still was difficult to read mostly because of the small font. It was frustrating, especially when there are so many goddamned pages on their menu. The waiter came by to check if we needed more time on the menu, which we did due to the small font and many pages. Eventually we were ready to order. The waiter looked very pissed and impatient when he kept coming to check on us and we weren't ready to order LOL. Stuffy guy.  Anyway, onto the food. The food was very good. But so very small for the asking price! I couldn't help but feel like I only got a taster of some sort. This place is charging more for the food, they should at least have nicer tables and utensils for the guests. We were using disposable wooden chopsticks and rickety old tables. :T"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and super friend and super small. I think that's why it's soo amazing. You can't sit more than 20 people. Just a heads up. The employees are crazy friendly & the food pretty much speaks for it self. Otherwise I wouldn't be giving such a positive review.   I'm not sure if this place can accommodate children. We wanted to bring our kids but decided against it because of the cold. Make sure you ask ahead if they have high chairs.   The food comes out quickly and everything is super fresh."}
{"text":"I'm stingy with my stars when it comes to sushi, but this place deserves every one of them! The food is EXCELLENT. However, the restaurant is tiny - only seats like 10-15 people, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. Also be prepared to be packed in like sardines. It feels a bit rushed and chaotic inside since the area is so small, but you do get that traditional hole in the wall feel. If you want a luxurious, relaxing vibe for a nice date or something, this isn't it. It's also kind of pricey, but it's worth it. Lunch has lower prices, so if you're on a budget, come during the day."}
{"text":"Ordered Omakase.... the sushi is not good considered it is $100 (I expect more authentic sushi... it is a lil better than All you can eat sushi... c'mon...), I expect more customer service.. but  instead I got: 1. \"Can you take your chopstick away\" x 10  2. \"Can you move in a little\"  (Constantly) 3. Giving me my bill before I ask for it.  I feel like I am eating fast food... The experience is belong bad and I will not come here again.  Overpriced... you can have better sushi somewhere else ..."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant not surprised me. The stuffs are all speaking Korea. The place is quite small even not comfortable. I was try to order Uni sashimi which $12 per order on menu,but the waitress told me the original Uni not available yet only $30 per order Uni available which from Japan! I was quite confuse cause the expensive one not on the menu, and how could I separate its from Japan or anywhere else? I am not happy with that. The food is ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out after Yoga the other day because of the high ratings on Yelp and because it was the most convenient. I ordered the spicy tuna roll, dynamite roll, uni sashimi(wasn't that fresh), salmon sashimi, black cod and hamachi neck. It definitely satisfied my sushi craving however it wasn't amazing. Don't get me wrong - it is good here but I love Japanese food and already have quite a few go to's that are consistently good so it would have to be pretty impressive for me to intentionally go back."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had so far! Everything I ordered was fresh. Salmon just melted in my mouth! Japango roll was awesome! Great experience! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Japango is a jem. Unfortunately a couple of things make this place just okay.  Food: They probably have one of the freshest fish in Toronto, Sashimi is good quality and their garlic oil sauce they put on top of tuna sashimi is delicious. Chirashi don, sushi lunch is among my favourites here.  Service: Service is okay. The waitresses are kind and responsive. However the place is really small and they have the smallest and tiniest tables and chair which makes most people uncomfortable. Do make reservation as they will not take any walk-in's for dinner.  I really don't like the chef & the owner's here. One time I took a girl on a date to this place, did not make a reservation and walked in. They asked me if I make reservation and I said no, the waitress asks the chef if there's any tables available and the chef turns to me, looks at me up & down and says rudely 'NO, WE ONLY TAKE RESERVATION'.   Total turn off, their food is good, but their attitude towards their customers really displeases me.  The chef at Sushi Couture learned from the same chef as the ones at Japango, I go their instead."}
{"text":"In a town full of crap sushi, this place is worth the splurge. The owner is a beautiful soul and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Finally, I had some really fresh sashimi at a fair price in Toronto. People make reservations even for a Friday lunch. To be fair, the place is a little small too that's probably why, but it is very good.  Price/quality at this place is extraordinary. Its when you find places like this that you realize how valuable Yelp is, there was no way I would come across this place on my own.  I definitely recommend it. just one thing, the place is small so make sure you make reservations before you go."}
{"text":"Japango use to be really good with consistent food. Came back once they changed owners and I don't think I've ever been so angry. I asked for a table of three, they told us we only have 40 minutes to eat after being seated... I asked to keep a menu, the server takes it and with attitude replies \"you can get it when you need it\". At that point I was already unimpressed but I stayed since I was super hungry! Ordered the king salmon sushi and it was super fishy. I would rate the food mediocre at its best. Super disappointed and it would've cheered me up if the food was above average atleast. I paid a premium to still be hungry, unsafisfied, and treated with disrespect. I hope I just came on a bad day because I definitely want to try this place one more time, definitely will update if I do!"}
{"text":"awesome old school tiny sushi shop downtown in old chinatown. forget the fancy rolls, and get sashimi or the chirashi don - you cant hide behind sauces and bbq. for the regulars, you can store your chopsticks there for when you return!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is rather small.  Gotta make reservation.  Sashimi and sushi are very fresh and good.  Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Simply put: Cute cozy (small) restaurant. Great japango roll and spicy salmon roll. Mediocre dynamite roll. Quick service. Somewhat pricy. Would go again if I'm in the area, but not with more than 2 ppl. 3.5/5, rounded up to a 4."}
{"text":"As I share my Sashimi experience around the world on my blog, this is the first time I've been rejected to be served while I make a reservation at least 3 days ahead.  They do not serve Omakase to one person, minimum order is two people. I would think if the chef had to prepare Omakase ahead of time, regardless if it's 1 person or 20 people, they'd have the ability to do so? Even Chef Jiro and Shiro serve person of one, truly disappointed. I feel like I'm being penalized for dinning alone."}
{"text":"thanks for another amazing meal.   melt in your mouth fish. perfect sushi rice. for what you get, the best value in the city."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Japango! The sushi is made to order and the sashimi freshest I've had in a long time. I highly recommend making reservations for lunch as space is limited for my party of three wed made reservations in advance and we're seated right away. For appetizers I'd say anything is great we had the gyoza and edameme. For mains we had sushi 1 combo...Bento box and Chirashi.  Also recommend the spicy mayo, it's not Sriracha sauce and mayonnaise but a house blend hot sauce and mayonnaise! Very fiery and will really get the sinus going!"}
{"text":"Japango never disappoints so I come here often. It's very small so reservations are a good idea. My favorite is the sushi deluxe and there are always good specials. The fish is always fresh. Seating is very tight so it's not the kind of place to linger with drinks after dinner. Service is attentive and friendly. A bit pricey but worth it to me."}
{"text":"authentic Japanese place, only about 8 tables.  Not suitable for big parties.  Fish is always fresh, they get their shipments on Thursdays so weekends are the best days to visit.  They often offer unique rare fish varieties that are not offered elsewhere.  make sure to make reservations or else it will be a long wait"}
{"text":"Best authentic Japanese sushi at a very affordable price. Quality of fish sashimi is superb and presentation is very nice."}
{"text":"Service: ** Taste: *** Value: *** Ambience: **** Diarrhea Index: ****************************  I had the oyster shooter and sashimi dinner Deluxe tonight.  The server rushed us out within an hour.  I thought he was being rude, but no, he is being considerate.  He was probably thinking by this time I should really go out and find a toilet.  Love this guy.  This place is so awesome my ass went puking afterwards.  Also, to give you a little context, I am a sushi lover, I grew up in China, where everything is supposed to be quite dirty, I eat streetfood like the thousand year old stinky tofu or the dead chicken that failed to hatch from an egg or eyes or balls from some animal, in China. And maybe chicken skewers that are actually from rats. No diarrhea. This place, some harmless fish gave me diarrhea.   Bravo Japango, of all the 1 stars I have given on yelp, this one is for the food."}
{"text":"Japango has been around for a long time, and I have dined here multiple times before. I remember that 5+ years ago, this was one of the better places for sushi, and they were one of the very few restaurants that would flame certain types of fish to give it that extra layer of flavour.  Which brings us to 2017 - after not having been here for a few years, a friend suggested to do take-out sushi from here. Upon coming back here to pick up the sushi+sashimi platter (medium size, $75 + $20 for \"deluxe\"), the cramped seating and the small-ness of the restaurant looks definitely pathetic compared to all the newer and bigger Japanese eateries that have opened up since my last visit.   The sushi/sashimi platter that I picked up looked good, and the fish tasted OK. What I found disappointing though is that even with the $20 extra that I paid for the \"deluxe\" version, I did not find the fish variety better, nor were there any notable stuff like toro or uni. In fact, there were multiple repeats like the standard salmon and tuna. I can't help but to think I got ripped off, or that it would have been the same if I didn't pay extra.  There were some aburi (flamed) sushi in the platter, but there are now other restaurants in Toronto that does a much better job, and better flavours.  Having that said, I like the freshness of their fish, but for future sushi outings Japango would definitely not be my first choice.  Overall, I would give Japango 2.75 stars."}
{"text":"What a treat this place is. Amazing tasting sashimi and sushi. Fast and friendly service. Definitely would be back."}
{"text":"Tiny tiny place on a stinky street, (make a reservation) but some of the freshest fish you'll have in TO. ask for their special fresh imported fish (i know that's an oxymoron) of the day and have just that - sushi or sashimi style. 1 order two pieces. they also have intricate and awesome hand rolls (unlike most places that make hand rolls comparable to burritos) try the spicy tuna one (different from most other standard spicy tuna hand rolls) and the crispy salmon skin hand roll (yum!)  they even have a wall of regulars -- if you call ahead they will put out your own chopsticks! -- how do i get on that list?! haha. i dunno.  worth the try :)"}
{"text":"I went there for Omakase with friends. I was very disappointed.  Don't waste your money here.  The service is just pure awful. They were not respectful to the customers and my guests.  They always try to rush you order and rush you out.  Maybe it is the manager who needs some basic lesson about customer service.  Their website advertised price is $80/person, and yet they charged us $100/person.  When asked, they told us we should have spend the time to read the menu (which indeed was $100).  Their attitude were ridiculously arrogant and bad.  The food is average, nothing great nothing bad.  Overall this is the worst experience I had, and the only 1 star I gave on Yelp.    Go to JaBistro, Yasu or Zen if you are uptown.  They have way better food and comes with customer services."}
{"text":"So good! Completely agree with all of the other positive reviews on here about fresh and high quality food. The price point is very fair for what you get. As others have said, the place is tiny, so make reservations."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in Toronto!  Small, intimate and delicious!  The service is fast even though it's all made to order and extremely fresh."}
{"text":"5 stars for the sashimi! Great lunch time menu for anyone who can make it out during weekday lunches. Try for a reservation if you can - the restaurant is very small and seats ~20 guests with its 10 tables.  Chirashi Don ($25) - Very fresh sashimi and fair portion  - On weekday lunch times, this is $19 - Comes with a miso soup  Tempura Udon  - Comes with 2 shrimp tempura and an assortment of veggie tempura (sweet potato, broccoli, squash, eggplant etc) - Udon was cooked well and the broth was great!  Dragon Roll - At $14, I'd say I've had better rolls at equivalent prices elsewhere  Service was great. They had 2 waiters covering the small area. Food came quickly as well as the sushi chefs are right behind the bar a metre away.  Overall, Japango is a great little spot for sashimi and Japanese food near the Eaton Centre area. Opt for sashimi over rolls for maximum deliciousness and value when you're here!"}
{"text":"Japango is such a little hidden gem that I am typing this review with utmost hesitation. It is difficult enough to get a table at this tiny little authentic Japanese sushi restaurant as is. I really shouldn't be doing this.   Not only is the food consistently spectacular and the service always courteous, Japango's lunch specials are out of this world deals. My favourite thing to order (at any time and price) is the chirashi which features a colourful array of delicately sliced sashimi and tataki arranged artfully on a bed of warm, fragrant Japanese rice. It's the fine details such as the incredibly fragrant and flavourful shiso leaves, refreshingly non-watery daikon threads, paper thin lemon slices, and roasted sesame seed garnish that make all the difference. I get the chirashi every time, but neighbouring orders of everything else always looks great too.  The authenticity is key here. The small and at times squishy space along with the miniature water glasses (that require constant refills) are reminiscent of Japan's atmospheric eateries. There is even a wall of tacky autographed celebrity photos that are juxtaposed with the homey decor. You could almost pretend you were at the Tsukiji fish market.   Show up with no more than a group of two if you want to minimize your wait time for a table during lunch hour. I've been telling too many people about this amazing place!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and had a pleasant experience. It is a small and cozy restaurant, so it can get quite busy and stuffy during high peak times. On to the real reason why I came... THE FOOD. My friend and I had ordered the Chirashi, which is a variety of sashimi on sushi rice. We both really enjoyed it. The sashimi was very fresh and the rice was flavorful. I think it is fairly priced for what you get and the service is very welcoming. I would recommend this place. Solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Place is small but quite neat clean and cozy. We were two and ordered 2 main dishes which were tempura udon and chirashi  (various fish sashimi with sushi rice underneath). They came in cute bowl and bento and looked so beautiful and delicate!The portions were quite a lot for two, we could hardly finish it. the sashimi included more than 5 types of fish and the rice was well flavoured. The udon was light and warm which became the best supplement for the chirashi. The prices were reasonable and the service for food is fast! Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"Japango was once a gem in a sea of pseudo Japanese food in Toronto.  Over the years the quality has gone way down and putting up with the tiny, cramped dining room isn't worth it if the food isn't good.  But there is good news for sushi lovers in the area... Yutaka is an authentic, high quality Japanese restaurant in a beautiful, modern and open concept space just around the corner, steps away from Japango."}
{"text":"I like to consider Japango as my secret hidden gem. A few minutes away from Yonge and Dundas, this unassuming resto is tucked away on a side street with very little fanfare to draw customers in.   A bit cramped inside is an understatement, but if tighten your belt a notch and can deal with small spaces, you'll be rewarded with fantastic food!   We usually go at lunch. Prices are lower, and always a a better deal than at dinner times.   Chirashi bowl is one of the best in the city, and their fresh sushi/sashimi of the day is always fantastic. Expect to find import cuts like Japanese uni(there's a difference), horse mackerel, amberjack, and Otoro.   Omakase is also a great choice if you want to fork out the cash. Price is reasonable enough, and great for those who are looking for a different experience.   Pro Tip#9844: Always call ahead - even if it's 15 minutes before arriving. They take reservations and you'll have a good chance of scoring a table. It's walk-ins mostly but if you arrive during busy hours, expect a long wait!"}
{"text":"Even after trying so many many new Japanese sushi places in Toronto that keeps opening up, Japango is still my family favourite sushi place!  Called last minute yesterday and 6pm was full but luckily there was still a table for 3 at 5pm.  This place is really tiny that sits about 17 people so be sure to make reservations.  Also, it's very cramped so you are here mostly because of the food.  Personally, I love the atmosphere, it's very authentic and it reminds of the restaurants in Japan.  We weren't too hungry at 5pm and we'll probably be having popcorn later at the movies so we just got the deluxe sashimi dinner ($35), avocado unagi rolls ($11) and grilled gindara ($15).  If you are a sushi/sashimi lover, then you must come try Japango!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went there for lunch on Friday since all other places were packed and lineups out of door, so we gave Japango a try. This tiny restaurant was packed when we got there, but there was one table almost done so we waited for 5 minutes to be seated.   The service was very prompt and friendly. From the time we ordered, then the food arrived and finished the food only took us a little more than 30 minutes. It was very efficient service for lunch.   I ordered the Chirashi don which came with 5 different kinds of thick cut sashimi. The fish was very fresh and nice selection.  Rice portion was generous, I wish the bed of sushi rice would have more flavours. The don came with soup and salad as well which was pretty standard. For $19, it was not bad for prime downtown location.   My coworkers had the sashimi don that consisted of chopped sashimi with hot sauce. The portion was not as substantial as Chirashi don, but it was only $13.   I am glad that I had a pretty satisfied meal at Japango. I would go back for more sushi and sashimi."}
{"text":"Japango really is the best sushi place in the city. Everything is always delicious and the staff are friendly. I went there for my birthday with my boyfriend and we decided to try the omakase tasting menu. It's definitely a special occasion meal if you're going to go for this, but well worth the cost and the overwhelmingly full feeling you'll leave with, because everything is delicious.  The omakase started with an oyster shooter and persimmon roll, both of which were delicious (my boyfriend agreed, even though he's not into oysters). This was followed by an excellent sashimi course, which included uni, which I'd never had before, and Japango's notoriously good butterfish, then a sake and clam soup. The sushi course was next, and then some tempura. The meal finished off with two courses of cooked sea bream in two declicious sauces. All in all, one of the best meals I've ever eaten.   To top it off, the staff made my birthday that little bit more special by bringing me a sushi cake (a rice patty with salmon on top), complete with a candle, and dimmed the lights and had the whole restaurant sing to me (okay, so the whole restaurant is only about 15 people, but still, I've never had a whole restaurant sing to me!) And they did this without us even asking (I ran into a friend who gave me a very loud 'happy birthday' as she was leaving).   Iv'e been going to Japango for a couple of years now and they've never failed to impress me. I think it's the best sushi in the city, and I know a lot of people who would agree."}
{"text":"This is my #1 spot for sushi in Toronto. Toronto has some excellent mid-range sushi restaurants (better than any I've found in NYC) but Japango is the closest I've come to the true sushi shops in Japan. A tiny space that can seat maybe 20 people, they do incredible sushi but I like to go for the chirashi. The fish is very fresh, the presentation is perfect. If your lucky and a regular you can even get your own special set of chopsticks hung behind the sushi bar"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Toronto!! Fresh sashimi from Japan, two thumbs up! Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"The sashimi and rolls here are phenomenal. The quality of food is fantastic (you won't go back to All-You-Can-Eat Japanese buffets after having good quality sashimi/sushi/maki) and the service is great.   I recommend the Japango roll - it has salmon, scallops, and flying fish roe; it's so delicious that I could have eaten the whole serving myself.  The blue fin tuna belly was pricey ($23) for four pieces, but I'd say try it once if you're looking to splurge. It's buttery and it just melts in your mouth.   Be sure to make reservations as this restaurant is really small. Alternatively if you walk in and it's packed, order take-out."}
{"text":"i went to japango  after hearing all the good reviews. I got the sashimi lunch bento box for about $16 after tax. The 10 pc of sashimi were Amazing, best presentation and freshness i've had in Toronto. The sashimi were freshly sliced and torched from a piece of fresh fish, unlike the other places where the sashimi have been pre-sliced and sitting there. The pieces were of good size and change daily so you do get a good variety. I don't fully recall the selection, but I do think i got to try some fish that I've never tried before. They all tasted amazing. However, the rest of the bento box came with miso soup, rice, seaweed salad, piece of egg and some pickled veggies. To be honest, non of those sides really left an impression on me. I vaguely remember the rice could have been better and the pickled veggies are certainly acquired tastes.   I ordered take out so i couldn't sit down, but i did get a nice cup of green tea while I waited. the service was very fast and I got to watch the chef cut my sashimi which was super neat to see!  I would like to try their sit down menu at some point, perhaps when the tiny restaurant is not packed."}
{"text":"Small sweet place, came here on a date. Atmosphere wise - casual and well designed yet small and a bit cramped.    We ordered the   Chirashi, and the Dragon Roll. Chirashi came with a side salad and miso soup. We also received tea with our dinner.  The salad was standard found in Asian restraints around the area. The miso was also standard nothing special.  Chirashi came with an assortment of sashimi, but thing special to note.  Dragon Roll was smaller than other places - standard as well.  End price for the two came to $37.30 without tip for reference.  Average and pricy - would not recommend but would still go with friends if they decide to go here.    3.5/5"}
{"text":"Quality here used to be way way better. Disappointed in my last visit here. Sushi was just mediocre."}
{"text":"This is the place where we officially coined the term, \"Sushi Quarterback.\"  Our friend was calling the shots, making the plays, changing the orders last minute based on what his good friend (the sushi chef himself) recommended fresh for that day, meal, night...  Oh my god.  It was good.  I have photographic (pornographic) evidence to prove it. Just ask.  I'll show you.   The rolls were inventive, even crispy (which I tend to avoid) and delicious.  Pieces of sashimi so fresh that I, as an on-again vegetarian, swear trembled at our bites and let out a little cry (fish can cry).  Each course came in succession, always \"just enough\" and never leaving us wanting for more, waiting for the next round, or on the other end of the scale... We never sat there thinking, \"We are going to die.  We just ate the ocean.  We will definitely die from eating too much.\"   Sake came at the right times, dishes were prepared within a millisecond of consumption, and these bastards were samurai-masters in the arts of both temperature and texture.  It's worth a flight to Toronto, that's for damn sure.  I'll go again.  One last thing?  If any bullshit motherfucker tries to tell you that they know the best sushi in Toronto?  They're a liar if they say anything other than \"Japango.\""}
{"text":"I love love their japango roll! I've never tasted any other roll that was this good.   The place is very cozy and small. For dinner, you definitely need to make reservations because they will just send you away if you don't have any. As for lunch, you can go without one, but it does get a little busy, so go early!   I also ordered a sashimi platter and it was delicious too. I would definitely recommend this place although it's a bit expensive! It's worth it."}
{"text":"Japango big or japango home!  This is one my favourite sushi restaurants in Toronto. It is a small quaint restaurant with modest decor. Be warned that you should be prepared to spend more than you might at other places. This place is owned by the same owner as the Yuzu no Hana so you can expect similar high quality food.   Disclaimer: my reviews are based solely on the many times I have gotten takeout. I plan to edit this review to reflect my experience dining in and having their daily specials.   I usually get the Sashimi One lunch combo because I absolutely love the sashimi here. This combo consists of assorted pieces of sashimi, a soup, and some rice. The service is usually very friendly and more than accommodating when I'm waiting for my food. The sashimi is to die for. You can taste the difference between this sashimi and ayce sashimi (not that I don't love me some ayce) - flavourful and not frozen. The wide variety of sashimi satisfies my seafood cravings, especially with my preference of really strong flavours. Also, I rarely eat the ginger at most Japanese places, but I gobble down the bits offered at japango.   I highly recommend this place to anybody looking to have some good Japanese food. I hear very good things about their daily specials and hope to try it in the near future!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place A LOT, it was once our go-to place for high quality sushi and sashimi.   Super disappointed with their omakase menu... felt extremely rushed... our plates were taken away as soon as we picked up the nigiri from the plate. I understand the whole experience is up to the chef but we literally finished an 8 course meal in 30 min... and the bill was not cheap... Also, there were more cooked items on the menu than actual sashimi/sushi which we were not a fan of.. for some strange reason they really love deep frying their fish and it's overly done and greasy (e-v-e-r-y single time).   I am a huge fan of their sushi... I just would not recommend their omakase menu.  Value: 2/5 (for omakase only) Service: 2/5 (felt rushed) Ambiance: 2/5  Food: 2/5 (only for omakase)"}
{"text":"A go-to spot for good sushi at a reasonable price. I've been coming to Japango for years now and they never disappoint. It's a popular spot so make reservations and ensure everyone is punctual or they won't seat you. The space itself is super narrow - quite dim and cozy (if not congested) in the evenings so it's best for groups of 4 or less. Sushi is good quality and they seem to change their lineup in the set meals depending on what's fresh. There are always a few aburi-style pieces too as an added bonus. Service is efficient and the dishes are neatly presented. Their Chirashi ($23) and Chirashi Supreme ($30) are especially pretty and packed with ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is a true gem. It's incredibly tiny with only a handful of tables. However, the food is PHENOMENALLY TASTY! Their Japango maki melt in your mouth and the other rolls on the menu are always made with fresh ingredients. You absolutely owe yourself a visit here. You won't regret it. These guys are incredibly good at what they do. My expectations were exceeded right away. I hope yours will too."}
{"text":"I must be the only one who didn't absolutely love Japango!  Still a solid 3 star for me. The service was good, the food was very good. (I had a sunumono salad ($5), california roll ($6) and a spicy tuna roll ($7), but there was no WOW factor for me.   The place is tiny. Decor-wise it had a very tradtional Japanese feel. I didn't like that the tables were all rammed so close together. I wanted to properly catch up with one of my besties but it was a bit hard to chat given close proximity to other guests. Table was tiny and I had to consciously keep my elbows in check.  I would like it better if it was cheap. Just saying."}
{"text":"Small quaint sushi bar with very fresh sashimi, with different cuts and types of fish. Japango roll was great and it seems like it's different every time.  Fresh Oysters were not very sweet and the tuna tartar was just alright. Will definitely visit again but not with a big group."}
{"text":"4.6  A small typical Japanese place for good sushis and other tempuras, salads. Very fresh and almost mouth-melting fish pieces. Waitresses are OK. Cookers are nice.  WIll go back for sure, when craving for good sushis in a place downtown not full of neon lights, black cubic chairs, noisy and with doubtful fish freshness, like lots of other sushi places around.  Why not 5... I need to taste more from their menu, they should be open later than 10 PM, there is no major sushi creation (the ones of the day are to try, but most of the time they remain simple sushi, no extravaganza), fish is almost metling (= not all of them were, which is sad when it happens to be the red tuna ones)."}
{"text":"Excellent quality fish, I've had sashimi from all over Asia and Vancouver, and this is definitely the best quality sushi I've had in Toronto. Their sushi rice is perfectly cooked and marinated, and the sashimi pieces are cut thick with some pieces flamed grilled on the spot. I usually get the chirashi lunch for $17. The place is small with no frills. They can usually you a table if you call few hour ahead for reservations!"}
{"text":"Japango is a tiny sushi shop tucked off the side of Yonge with very tight seating conditions (necessitating the waitstaff to shuffle tables to and fro so that customers wishing to exit or relieve themselves don't unceremoniously send their neighbours' Japango rolls to the floor) and eclectic decor of various celebrities' autographed portraits, sake kegs, daruma, and a maneki neko. Came with the girlfriend and we ordered a Japango roll, spicy scallop roll, soft-shell crab rolls, a pair of o-toro nigiri, and a dinner set (6 Cali rolls, 4 assorted nigiri, Teriyaki beef and rice, tempura medley with two shrimp and some veggies). Everything was delicious but we particularly enjoyed the spicy scallop and soft-shell crab rolls. Shrimp a little over-battered for my taste but the sweetness of shrimp flavour still persists. O-toro was available that day and they did not disappoint with the melt-in-your-mouth succulent richness balanced out by well seasoned rice. Recommended."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place for sushi downtown but the past two times i've gone i was sorely disappointed. The sushi quality has gone down dramatically with the rice being on the soggy and mushy end. The only reason why i'm not giving them one star is that the service is still fast and efficient."}
{"text":"There are two types of sushi eaters.  1. Normal sushi eaters who love their sashimi, sushi, and makis 2. Lame ppl like me, who don't eat raw fish, but love all the rolls and hot foods.  If you are a lame person like me, you won't really get the hype of Japango. I ordered their maki combo ($16) that came with miso soup, salad, a tempura roll, california roll, and salmon roll (which I upgraded to spicy salmon crunch roll for an extra $2). The soup was not that great and neither was their salad. The california roll had more avocado than one can possibly imagine, so that overwhelmed the taste of the california roll (i.e., the rice and the seaweed). The tempura roll was pretty average, but the spicy salmon was really good. Very rarely have i had a spicy salmon roll that was actually spicy. Their wasabi texture was great too; but if I were to rate this place based on my meal, it'd get a measly 3 stars.  What stands out in this place is their fresh fish. They have large, thick, fresh slices of fish slightly seared if you order the sushi a la carte. Even though I don't eat raw fish, what my friend ordered looked delicious enough to tempt me. I can see why everyone loves this place. My friends who did order their sushi a la carte loved every bite.  It's important to know that you really should make a reservation before coming here. One time I came with my friend and attempted to get a seat at 8pm on a weeknight, there was no room for us. This place is tiny but they take reservations, so why not make it?"}
{"text":"Definitely above average sushi. Fresh and filing.   We came on a Thursday night and there were tables available so no problem there. The restaurant was incredibly tiny though, I counted only 8 small tables and I was basically eavesdropping on my neighbours' conversations since the tables were so close together.   As for the food, we ordered the chirashi dinner, sashimi dinner and Japango roll. The sashimi was fresh and they were pretty generous with the portions-- I was already full halfway through the sashimi. The Japango roll was flavourful and a little spicy. I see some reviewers comparing Japango to Jabistro but to me it seems more comparable to Wow Sushi in terms of quality and price."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I go here at least once a month for lunch. We always try to get there early because the place is quite small and fills up fast. It's definitely not made for large groups.   Customer service is great because the staff are always attentive.   I usually go here when I'm in a \"treat yourself\" kind of mood since it can be quite pricey. My go-to is the chirashi bowl! I normally get the chirashi dinner ($27) but today I splurged and got the chirashi supreme ($37)! It's bigger and has more fish. I was super happy with it and will definitely get it again - I just need to save up for it!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite sushi restaurant. Food quality is still good but the service is terrible.  Waiters were quite rude. We were not informed of a $35 min pre-tax charge per person on groups of 5+ ($200 bill plus tips...?) on top of that it turned out that it is impossible to split the bill and only 2 credit cards (!!) would be accepted between all 5 people.  So, dear Japango, if you would still like to keep your customers please improve your service quality."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and to be honest I have been craving their maki rolls ever since. I am definitely planning to come back. Service: Excellent, servers and chefs were very friendly and welcoming. Wait time: We came at an odd hour so there were no line ups but the place is very small so I'd expect there to be a pretty long wait time during busy hours. Food: We tried the Japango, soft shell crab and green dragon roll. Loved them all especially the Japango roll. The black sesame ice cream was also very delicious, very creamy and smooth. You can definitely taste the high quality and effort they put into their menu items."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot. Small cozy restaurant but it is the best, their sushi and sashimi always meet the standards. I recommend making a reservation before going to avoid waiting in line. Their japango roll is must to try."}
{"text":"Really great sushi, great service. The place is a total hole in the wall but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Super solid sushi.  Japango roll is a must. Friendly service. Tiny place. Don't go is a rush. A sushi chef's sushi bar."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant I've eaten at in Toronto.  I use to frequent the Annex sushi restaurants but after eating here, I can't go anywhere else.  They cost a little more then the other places but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Popped in at the recommendation of our hotel concierge. Had excellent sushi and we were able to finish in the short time frame we had. Service was excellent too. My only complaint is that the gyoza we ordered were a little too crunchy for my taste, but otherwise I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This tiny hole in the wall is truly a gem. I came here at around 12 p.m. and around more than half of the restaurant was already full. The place was very small and they try to fit as many tables as possible. I ordered chirashi bowl which was $17 for lunch time. Usually I don't go to ala carte restaurants but the reviews brought me here. For the bowl, it was imaginably one of the best dishes I've ever ate. The selection of fish they gave me were all fresh and delicious. The rice itself is another story, the rice was very good since I could taste the rice vinegar in it and they gave a very distinct taste. Overall I feel like this place is a quick eat and go restaurant as there is very limited seating and there's usually a line up at the door. I would totally come back here if I'm in the mood for another chirashi bowl!"}
{"text":"Japango is always my favorite. Although it's a little bit expensive, once a while is great! I love the sushi one and Chirashi lunch combo. Fish is fresh. Portion is big ( well, at least makes me full). And they cut the fish really thick. I like that they torch the fish so the fat is on the surface of the fish. YUMMM.  I have been there a few times. Services was bad when I went there last time. This time, the lady was really nice."}
{"text":"Delicious but long wait. We came here because of the reviews. The venue is tiny but I've dined in smaller venues. However, the service is super slow so be ready to order as soon as you sit down. I had the green dragon roll and the rainbow roll, which was very flavourful. They were so busy that they forgot to serve us tea. But overall, the sushi was fresh and on par with Wow Sushi near Yonge and Charlton."}
{"text":"If i had JUST eaten the Japango roll this would be a straight up 5 stars..... THAT THING IS INCREDIBLE. Best roll ever and the spicy factor just makes all the flavours sing in your mouth.   It was lunch for me and my friend, we got tea, complimentary miso soup (YUMMY!!) and ordered the Japango roll which has soo many positive reviews on here, the gyoza dumplings, and the green dragon roll. The gyoza dumplings were A-OK (3/5), the Japango roll was a 5/5 for sure, the green dragon was a 4.5/5. The service was  very friendly...except we ran out of tea and it would have been nice if someone came by to ask if we needed more or offered any water.  My biggest comment is COME early for lunch. I arrived at 11:30 and got 1 of the 2 only tables which WERENT reserved. Also note: you can reserve a table - so do it.  The place is tiny tiny tiny and tucked away on a small start - easily missed. When you walk in you need to like squeeze into the tables (which is particularly hard when youre feeling alreayd bloated and have a large goose jacket on).   After tax and tip lunch came to $40.75 which is more expensive than your typical lunch places but was also a very pleasant surprise and a place I will come back to. Ive heard good things about their lunch boxes so i would try one of those... if i can get awya with fitting a japango roll in me as well.   OVERALL: 4.5/5. BEST ROLL IN TORONTO: JAPANGO ROLL"}
{"text":"even after reading some previous reviews i still ended up tripping at the front door! old age bad memory i guess. this place is super small like half a shoe box small. rubbing elbows while eating raw fish, guy sitting next to you getting up rubbing a$$ on your sapparo beer (not cool). it's all good though still a cozy little restaurant. be prepared to wait outside in the winter time so find a good parking spot on the street.   the creativity in the dishes are very much similar to the Yuzu sister restaurant. man i really love that smoke sashimi. wait service was ok not overly slow but cause of the limited space it's hard for the waiter to maneuver. some may find it irritating but what can you do  dishes i really enjoyed  -Japango roll - signature roll covered in smoke sashimi and eel (cant remember what was on the inside)  - Softshell crab roll - came out nice and crisp i hate it when it's soggy which is often the case at other places  -Seasame ice cream tasted like umm seasame! go figure (looks like playdoh)  - pretty much all their sashimi (it really does taste better then most places)   - when buying japanese beer opt for the large bottle and not standard because the price difference is very marginal"}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi were delicious, but the service was so bad I would never want to come back again. The server was rude and impatient."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for the longest time as I've heard pretty good things about it. Japango did not disappoint! We came for dinner at around 6 as the place is known for being really small and we didn't want to line up. We were walking past the restaurant and we weren't even sure if it was open - the restaurant was all dark and the open sign wasn't lit up. Good thing we checked as it was indeed open and surprisingly not crowded!   The restaurant was really small though, I felt like you could fit 15 people max in there. The waiter was really prompt, seated us and got us menus right away. I ordered the sashimi dinner ($28) and he had the sushi dinner ($23). Service was extremely fast, we got our order in less than 10 minutes and everything was delicious and fresh. I was pretty happy with the variety and quality and the price was not that expensive for what you were getting.   Our waiter was almost too eager, I suppose the restaurant is small so he can see everyone but he was extremely fast at everything and we were in and out of the restaurant in about half an hour. I enjoyed the sushi here and would come back if I was in the area for a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"Yup.  That's a three-star review for one of the most lauded sushi places in Toronto.  It pains me to do it, but I don't think I really had a choice.  I spent the past few weeks making repeat trips to a bunch of the well-Yelped sushi places downtown to weigh them against eachother and try to come up with a definitive winner.  What I found were three sushi places I feel I'll wind up rotating through for different things depending on what I want: Japango, Wow Sushi, and ND Sushi & Grill.  Unfortunately Japango was the most inconsistent and underwhelming of the bunch.  On my first visit I had the Lunch Sushi Combo 3, which was twelve pieces of nigiri - two pieces each of six varieties of fish - and a California roll.  The roll was nothing special, and was comparable to anything you'd find at the AYCE place nextdoor.  The nigiri was largely pretty solid though it wasn't anything mindblowing; the two standouts were the sea bream and the salmon, both of which were good, but not as good as Wow Sushi's.  A couple of the other fish were surprisingly not suitably fresh, carrying a slightly fishy taste that shouldn't have been present.  The actual size of each piece of nigiri was a bit smaller than I expected - other reviewers have characterized the sizes to be customary of Japanese portioning, which after spending a bunch of time in Tokyo I feel to be a generous assessment.  Nigiri at both Japango and Wow Sushi are on the small side.    After the middling lunch combo I ordered some otoro, and wanted to give their uni a shot since I'd heard they serve it as nigiri instead of gunkan style, firming it up with citrus. The otoro was pretty good, but nothing special as otoro's measured.  It didn't attain the level of melt-in-your-mouth bliss one hopes for.  I did appreciate the knife work: though the otoro itself was definitely better at Wow Sushi, the actual knife skills on display at Japango were superior.  The uni arrived as two pieces of gunkan maki, but the quality of the uni was wonderful; delightfully smooth and rich with flavour, without being overpowering.  The uni definitely gets a thumbs-up.  A day later I returned with a group for dinner, determined to give Japango another shot.  This time around the experience was better, though mistakes were still made.  I think the items that are unique or difficult to find at other sushi places are the real reason to come here.  The Japango roll was a definite highlight, and it'll probably keep me coming back from time to time despite the fact that they bungled its construction.  More on that in a moment.  Horse mackerel, served first as four pieces of nigiri with a dab of grated ginger, the carcass then returned to the kitchen and deep-fried into a delicious kettle chip of fish-bone goodness, was perfectly executed.  All the sushi was fresh this time around.  That said, I watched as my Japango roll was assembled atop the sushi bar, and it was kind of tough to ignore when the lid of the assistant chef's saucing bottle came apart and fell onto the roll.  I watched as he gave a panicked look to one of the staff members behind the counter in an, \"Oh sh*t, what do I do?!?\" moment.  Her eyes went wide and she gave him a slight and unhelpful shrug, which seemed to communicate \"I think you're screwed.\"  I then watched said assistant chef work to mop up the excessive amount of spicy sauce he'd doused the roll with, before continuing on and torching it for presentation.  The end product was still delicious, but I have reservations about any restaurant that's going to so blatantly screw up a dish right in front of me and still serve it.   My companions ordered some nigiri that was a bit above average, and one got the Japango Deluxe Bento Box, a mix of standard nigiri, solid tempura, and nothing-special teriyaki and sides.  It was all pretty by-the-numbers fare and I think if you're coming here for anything but the fish, you're probably not coming for the right reasons.  I don't hold that against them; it's a sushi place.  The service is quick, attentive, and sincere, with both the servers and the chefs behind the sushi bar giving plenty of attention to the patrons.  While there's no seating at the sushi bar itself, the head chef made an effort to give some eye contact and inquire about what I was interested in on both occasions, which is hugely appreciated.  Despite the place being packed I had no problem getting seats by myself or with my group, waiting only a few minutes in either case.  Verdict?  I'd return for the menu items I can't get anywhere else, and the actual skill of the head chef behind the counter is obvious.  That said, the small portion sizes, inconsistency, and the largely average quality of most of the fish - outpaced by other, cheaper options elsewhere in the city - is a big deterrent.  I wanted to like this place, but it just didn't connect for me."}
{"text":"I would definitely suggest making a reservation before coming to this small restaurant, and if you end up waiting you'll find yourself squeezed in beside other waiting patrons  - jealously watching the nicely presented plates of great sushi and sashimi get deliver to the tables.  This place is authentic and serves very fresh and delicious fish.  Their selection of fish is pretty broad and make sure ask about their specials to get the most out of your visit.  During our visit we tried:  - Aji: which they serve as a whole fish, with the meat of the fish served as sashimi (or sushi) and then they deep-fry the bones. - Otoro Sushi: So fresh and very delicious.  The fish was melt in your mouth and the rice was equally good. - King Salmon Sushi: This was one of their specials and a very nice change from the standard salmon.  They leave some skin on and do a quick char, which gives it a nice smokey flavour. - Japango Roll: I'm not 100% sure all the stuff that is on/in this roll, but I'm 100% sure I love it and would get it again. - Sushi Dinner: A very nice variety of fish (my favourite was probably the scallop), everything was fresh and very tasty.  The service is also very good, although they do get busy so you tend to wait a little bit. Overall, if you like sushi or sashimi this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Omgaaaaad the food here is the freakin bombbbbbbb. Came here with a friend and we only had to wait about 15 minutes (walk in, no reservation). We ordered 3 sushi rolls (spicy tuna, spicy scallop and some sort of house roll), all 3 were delicious. I ordered the sashimi dinner and the fish was extremely fresh. I still dream of the sushi I had from here. Definitely coming back when I have time. The plum wine is also great. Oh, and keep in mind that the restaurant it super small/cramped so bringing a big group here might not be the best idea."}
{"text":"OK. I'm going to start this one off with talking about the pro's. The spicy hamachi hand roll was fantastic, making me believe that the rest of the rolls would probably be pretty awesome, a few of the tables next to ours had rolls on em and they looked good, but alas, the real test is the quality (and quantity) of fish. in this department, i thought i had found the right place. I had been to japango 3 times prior, and had been on all 3 occasions unsuccesful in actually eating (one time which lead me to Akai on harbord, a proper sushi spot) all 3 times they were either closed (on sunday, a good sign) or too busy. Anyways, the actual sashimi was uninspiring, not well portioned, and where the fish wasnt totally fresh (ie: the red snapper) they charred or seared it, an trick that isnt all too un-tasty but a trick never the less. That said, i dont think ill come back to japango, and albeit the fanfare, i just dont think its That awesome."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone can rate this place any less than 5 stars. To date, this is the best place I've ever had sushi at. And I eat a lot of sushi (at least in Toronto).  Sashimi was super fresh and probably the best I've ever had. Also, they had this roll where they had to blow torch it to cook it. Immediately I ordered it and definitely did not regret it. Best $20-$30 I've ever spent.  The only thing is that the service is okay and the restaurant is a little cramped, but their food forces my mouse to click 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very good for when you have craving for quick sushi! We were out late and was looking for fast and fresh sushi and we found Japango. Satisfied our craving."}
{"text":"I have been a very loyal customer to Japango for the past 5 years, but this has changed due to a recent incident that happened. I will never look at the restaurant the same and obviously will NEVER go back again.  I ordered Chicken Katsu last Thursday through UberEats, I've ordered the same dish from UberEats many times before. Around 2:30 AM on Friday, I woke up and started throwing up. Since then I threw up every 30 minutes to an hour until approx. 10:30 in the morning (total of around 10 times). I \"crawled\" to a walk-in clinic around noon and the doctor said I got food poisoning. I then stayed on my bed for the rest of Friday with a fever of 39 degrees. I spent the entire weekend on my bed and did not eat anything until Saturday night.  My mom and my boyfriend went to Japango Friday evening to complain about this incident, only to get shoved away by the store manager (a male Korean). His attitude was unbelievably bad and he said he was \"very busy\" and did not have time to deal with us. He asked us to reach out to UberEats since we ordered from them, and said the restaurant had no responsiblity (Excuse me??? UberEats only delivers my food, I don't think they cook the food???) The manager also said that they pay UberEats $10,000 every month for UberEats to deal with things like this. One time a girl also got food poisoning and she got a solution by reaching out to UberEats.  I am extremely disappointed at how the store manager handled this situation. He did not apologize or show sympathy at all for the poor food quality. When I told my friends about this incident, many of them said that they've noticed the food quality has gotten worse at Japango recently (one of my friends got food poisoning from the uni sashimi one time). So, definitely will never return again.  BYE."}
{"text":"Probably the best sashimi I've had in Canada!  The maki and sushi are also very good.  The only negative would be the cramped environs, with few people fitting inside, and sardine-can-like seating during busy lunch hours.  Still I would highly recommend this restaurant for their sashimi quality!"}
{"text":"When all previous yelp reviewers comment how Japango small is.. I cannot comprehend until I drop by for their lunch specials.   Maybe I have been eating and yelping too much, I can barely fit through to sit down at the table... 6 inches gap between tables...that is really tight!!   And I am not used to staffs staring at me when I eat... 2 sushi chefs at the sushi counter, 3 waits staffs... I know they are NOT staring at me when I taking photos of my sushi or how I cross examine my food before I put it in my mouth but just too tight a space for a relaxing lunch.   Sushi Bento Box ($13)  - A good mixture of nigiri sushi: 2 each of salmon, tuna, surf clam, snapper and the best of all Aburi butterfish (half cooked, half raw but full in flavour!)  - fish are fresh and shari rice are perfect balance in proportion to the fish...   The lunch sushi set though is really good.. but did not Wow me..! Maybe I came here with too much of an expectations? or because it was just lunch and dinner can be better since it is a lot more pricier?!!   I will definitely going to give Japango another chance... but I think I will stick with their lunch offerings? Maybe some Udon?   They accepts all credit cards!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, and I did enjoy it, but either I ordered the wrong thing, or it didn't meet my expectations. Bottom line: yum, but pricey - we paid $70 for 4 rolls plus sake, left still hungry. I've had higher quality fish at AYCE joints (crazy, right?) Also the service was crap. But more on that after the important part, food.  We ordered: crunchy spicy salmon roll: I couldnt taste the fish over the spice. it was really the only flavour. not that it was bad, just really poorly balanced. too much sauce, not much crunch, fish was even a bit chewy. One of the worst crunchy spicy salmon rolls I've ever had, and probably one of the most expensive.  crunchy spicy tuna roll: better quality fish, less spice then the salmon. I've still had better rolls for half the price.  dragon roll: Not normally a fan of dragon rolls because most places can't get it right, but it was both of our favourite rolls of the 4, nicely balanced, good flavour.  Japango roll: Basically an Alaskan roll where they torch the top of the salmon and add some sauce. It was good, I liked the added complexity of torching the salmon, but again the fish was just shit quality.  We also ordered a bottle of house sake, average. had worse, had better.   The service. So, I know it's a tiny place. I know this because we ended up in conversation with the two girls sitting next to us which was great, but your dining experience really depends on who you end up next to. We had to ask to order after having our menus closed for a while, water/tea isn't refilled unless asked, the sake was forgotten until our 4th and final roll was being eaten. Both servers also had such a fake quality to them as well. \"oh so sorry\" no you aren't, don't bullshit me, I know the service industry.   The decor: I really did love the way the place looked. I sat on the bench side facing the chefs, and we hardly talked and just enjoyed the environment, people watching, listening to conversations[9].  The food was good, don't get me wrong, but between the cost  and service I just don't think it's worth it, considering the many, many options for sushi in this city."}
{"text":"Oh Yelp, you rarely steer me wrong. Looked up sushi in downtown Toronto and Japango looked appealing. The place is very compact - seats 20 tightly) and the servers were prompt, attentive and gracious.  The crowd looked to be a mix of visitors and some obviously local regulars judging from the warm greetings. Had the eel and avocado roll plus tempura appetizer. The meal came with a large mug of tea and a tasty thick miso broth brought immediately. Presentation was simple and lovely. Everything tasted so fresh and light. Very subtle flavors, well balanced. The tempura batter was crisp and not greasy and the veggies were plentiful (cauliflower, broccoli, squash, onion, courgette and eggplant) and juicy with a light bite, not soggy. My only disappointment was I would have preferred a sweeter/richer flavored dipping sauce for the tempura, if it was ponzu it lacked a citrus kick. Bit I asked for some lemon and was promptly brought a thick juicy lemon wedge . The soy sauce was especially tasty, full flavored and not too salty. Everything was excellent. Delicious!  We were unable to linger long because there were people waiting and it's so small."}
{"text":"The other reviews ain't lying: the food is amazing. I ordered a sushi lunch combo and some gyoza, while my dining partner had the spider roll and yakitori. Everything was delicious, and it was definitely some of the best Japanese food I've had in Toronto.  One single downside: the space. I knew it would be small, but it was also cramped. Various people all around us were knocking things over, bumping their legs into tables, and generally not reacting well to the set-up."}
{"text":"After two failed attempts to get seated at this restaurant, I FINALLY had the chance to try Japango on a Friday afternoon when I could afford the time to wait in line for lunch. There is always a wait for this restaurant, probably because it is so tiny, but on this particular day the wait was only about 15 minutes so it was okay. All of the staff here are super friendly, and they will take your order while you wait so that it's ready pretty much the second you sit down. It's like... seat, tea, soup, lunch, boom, boom, boom, everything just comes out all at once. Super efficient, which is great if you're in a rush, but also kind of creates a bit of an anxious vibe while you dine, so it's a double-edged sword in that sense.  I ordered the chirashi lunch special ($16) and then split the Japango roll ($13) with a friend. It was a good amount of food, as I left feeling full but not disgustingly so. I would have been fine just with the chirashi, but I'm a greedy glutton and really wanted to try the roll so... well, I do it for Yelp. The chirashi was good, and fresh, but didn't really stand out to me compared to the chirashi at other places. The Japango roll is their signature roll and is quite good - I think it has avocado in it and then seared fish on top and some kind of special sauce. Quite unique and very tasty. It was a bit spicy, but I enjoyed it so ate all my portion without complaint.  Overall, I think Japango is unarguably a good Japanese restaurant, although don't expect it to be mindblowingly amazing. That being said, the food is definitely good and fresh, the prices are reasonable for what you get, and the service is friendly. It is also pretty cool that you can see the chefs prepping the food and blowtorching sushi. Would return on another occasion provided the wait time isn't ridiculous."}
{"text":"I found this place to be subpar for the quality of the sushi and the service. My friend and I went on a Sunday night for dinner.  The price was pretty fair, i felt like it was cheaper than other places that you would go to, $23 for the regular sashimi and $28 for the regular sushi. It's weird that the deluxe sushi had 18 pieces and was $35, but the regular which is 15 pieces. So it was cheaper per fish to get the regular, maybe the deluxe had better quality? idk lol.  Make sure to go a bit earlier or get a reservation, the place only allows you to stay for 1 hour. The restaurant is really small and there isn't much room between tables, I suggest that you don't bring any bags (a small purse is fine) as you have really no room to put it. The servers are are very kind and sweet, but seemed a little rushed for you to order, I guess it's because of the 1 hour limit they implied.  For the food, I've never had salad with peanut butter? dressing so that was an interesting dish. The miso soup was the saltiest miso soup I have ever had...  The sashimi and sushi was a tad disappointing, I feel like the quality of the sashimi was about a 4/5 bc it wasn't the kind of fish I liked. The sushi was a 3/5 for the same reason. If you are into the fish sushi in the pictures then this would be a great place for you!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the high reviews on yelp and close to where I work. At first glance, I didn't have much of a high hope. It's very small and kinda dark. After the tasting the food though, I understood what all the praise was about.  My girlfriend and I ordered the chirashi and unagi don. The unagi was good but wasn't particularly better than others. The chirashi was very very good. The sashimi was very fresh and had more \"luxury\" fishes as well (like toro).  I would definitely come again. I do advise to come in small groups and without a lot of baggage though."}
{"text":"When it comes to Japanese in Toronto, Japango is the place to go for quality authentic cuisine. The intimate atmosphere brings a focus to the sushi chefs, and you immediately get the feel that they care about the food they put out.   I had the seafood udon, which came in a homey clay pot. The broth was extremely flavorful, and the udon was cooked al dente. There was a good amount of seafood in the pot, from scallops to shrimp to pieces of fish. As a whole, it was such a comforting dish that was simple but delicious. My boyfriend had the chirashi, which came beautifully presented with a good array of fish. Each piece was cut to the right thickness, and the freshness of the fish was apparent. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order at Japango, and I would definitely want to try their daily specials next time!"}
{"text":"Sushi was great quality, the salmon was fresh and flavourful. I also tried the japango roll which, to be honest, was nothing special. I highly recommend the spicy salmon roll and if you're in the mood for tempura, their tempura appetizer which comes with two shrimp and some delicious vegetable tempura is definitely worth it.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 4.5. Japango very solid Japanese restaurant.  Ordered via UberEats and I was very happy with the quality and taste.  Items ordered: Salmon Teriyaki - delicious, excellent portion, tasted like it was grilled and the sauce was amazing. Japango roll - really good but not as impressed as others were in their reviews. Spicy Tuna roll - nice heat and Tuna was very good. Tuna sushi and Salmon sushi... really nice texture and taste. Unagi don - really good.  I am disappointed that there was such a limited # of sushi options on the delivery menu but also understand it needs to be simple.  looking forward to having Japango again, want to visit now."}
{"text":"Japango is a quaint establishment located conspicuously on Bay and Dundas. I have heard that the lunch hour can be quite busy sometimes so it's a good idea to make a reservation beforehand to ensure a seat at the 20-seater restaurant. The modest space was simply decorated with wooden accents and boxes.   I opted for the Japango Deluxe Dinner which is a pre-fix course meal ($35.00). It comes with miso soup, green salad, tempura, sushi miso black cod and ice-cream.  The green salad was topped off with a gingery sauce and sesame seeds; it had a tangy taste to it. The miso soup wasn't spectacular so nothing more can really be said about it. It was refreshing that the tempura (shrimp and yam) was not too oily and that the batter was light. Instead of the miso black cod, I substituted it with beef teriyaki. The beef teriyaki was well-presented with a few stir-fry vegetables. Overall, the dish did not disappoint as the beef teriyaki was both tender and moistly marinated in the sweet sauce.   For the price point of the meal; I was surprised that the platter did not include a wider selection of nigri sushi. Rather the selection was quite traditional with tuna, salmon, sea bream, butter fish nigri sushi and 6 pieces of California roll. Despite the minor selection, I enjoyed the sushi as it was very fresh. The amount of rice balanced the ratio size of the fish and the rice was well-flavored.  Although our server was not the friendliest; she was relatively prompt to take away the empty plates and refilled our green tea. Furthermore, the price point may be higher than nearby competitors, but Japango do offer high-quality sushi."}
{"text":"So I walked in and ask if there's a table for 1, the person literally said \"no.\" And turned away..... Wow they definitely surprised me with their 'professional attitude'.  I was so disappointed because this was my fifth visit ... The previous visits were fine. But I guess they are just boosted by their past reputation.... Probably will not come again.   I'll need to find another to go place soon"}
{"text":"Decided to visit Japango again after a long hiatus. Observations from before still hold true. Long line ups, rushed service, dissonance between reputation, price and quality.   I ordered the lunch sashimi bento ($14) as takeout. The sashimi did not tastes fresh. I suspect it was torched for the very same reason. The rice was gummy.There is a good chance I will not be visiting Japango again after this experience."}
{"text":"I called in 3 days in advance from Montreal as I am travelling to Toronto and we wanted to try the place I ordered on the phone 3 orders of Uni and upon our very ponctual arrival they gave us the worst seat next to the door we froze the entire time. To find out they did not save the Unis which was the only reason i booked this place to start with. The waiter was rushing us. The fish nothing special it was fresh to say the most. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi and rolls as part of the \"deluxe dinner\".  The sushi was quite good, but the California rolls were so incredibly fresh and delicious my taste buds nearly died!  I also had the black miso fish (forget what kind) and tempura (also very fresh).  The service was very attentive.  We waited perhaps ten to fifteen minutes for the second course of our meal, and the waiter apologized for the \"long wait\" with two dishes on the house.  Next time my hubby and I come, we're going to order only california rolls- it'll be heavenly."}
{"text":"I got to try a bit of their sushi and it was pretty good. Almost on par with much more expensive places! I got the tonkatsu which was pretty good as well. Full of flavour and very well portioned. Although I do have to say I almost always enjoy tonkatsu. The place is really cramped though so it's best to get there early. The service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Everything was okay including the sushi, price, and staff/services. Sushi I think is fairly priced, but the staff/services are on the \"not-so-good\" side.  Since the space is limited, you may want to make a reservation, although we did make one and were refused to have a seat until all of us were there.  Would I come back? I don't think so. When everything is okay I would either want to pay little more and have great sushi, or pay less and go for non-Japanese owned sushi that's not so authentic but still good.  There is a comment that the servers were not Japanese and were rude or didn't understand the art of Japanese culture (what does that mean really???), but at least when I visited, they were all Japanese. The behaviour of the staff just reflects poor training of the restaurant--with which I agree--, not certain types of ethnic groups."}
{"text":"Came here for our little brother's birthday dinner. We are 3 siblings of Chefs. Great sushi! You really get good quality food and it's worth the price."}
{"text":"I took 2 distinguished guests to this place hoping to enjoy some great sushi. We had 7 people in total for the omakase. It was the WORST experience we've ever had at a so-called fine dining restaurant. When it was $130 per person, I expect great food, and stellar services.   The food was pretty good, though I would argue whether it's worthy of that price. Ja Bistro or Yasu was way better if you're willing to pay that much. The space was so small, which was fine. But the waiter kept tapping on our chairs and pushing us in. We were slim guys, but we literally had our chest to the table when eating. They also charged us full price for a vegetarian omakase. That must be the most expensive tofu I'd ever have paid in my life. Also, the full price advertised on the website was $80 per person but in fact it was $100, plus a mandatory 18% service charge. (Go check the site now, it still says $80). When taking away our plates, the waiter kept asking one of my guests to move away his chopsticks so that he could grab the plate. Seriously? You charge me 18% service and couldn't even remove the chopsticks or provide a new set for a new dish? I am not even going to get into how they served ice cream and cake: at the same time!! And asked us to eat our cake using chopsticks because they didn't have enough forks. I hope that when you're reading this you go: \"WOW!\" I didn't express any disgruntlement at the time because I was with my guests, so there was no prior argument or anything. The fact that they rushed us out at the end without letting us finishing our beer showed that they're just greedy guys wanting to maximize profit every single night.    Seems like other people have given it pretty high ratings, but sorry I just can't. Honestly, horrible place. I would never go back, nor would I ever recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"In town on business. Came here based on reviews. Love the atmosphere. Miso soup was awesome. Order Spider & Crunch roll"}
{"text":"It's a small sushi place that's quite hidden if you're not actively looking for it (I've missed it a couple of times before I really tried to look for this place). There's not a lot of seating inside so be prepared to be cramped. I'd recommend making a reservation as it's always quite packed. Unless you're a party of 2, it may be hard to just drop by and get seated quickly."}
{"text":"Not sure what all those reviews are about. It's not good and not fresh. We paid a lot more than normal and were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent quality in a nice intimate space that may make you feel that you have been transported into a mid sized city in Japan. Be warned, seating is very close to the kitchen and your clothes may end up scented with seafood."}
{"text":"Went their for lunch for the first time. I went with my usual go to order - the Chirashi bowl. I've tried them at all the hole in the wall places to all them fancy places. This one is definitely in my top 3.  Everything was super fresh, the variety was great. Just enough rice for the amount of seafood that was in my bowl. :)"}
{"text":"Small little restaurant that has amazing sushi. I'd definitely recommend going here. It seats a total of around 20 guests. I found this hidden gem because of my friends from Vancouver. They are super picky about sushi and recommended me to come here. It's been a total of two years now and I'm still eating here!"}
{"text":"So good. We had the Chef's Selection Sushi Sahimi. Everything was sensational. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We didn't have a reservation but got seated quickly. The place is tiny so I hey are very strict about reservation times."}
{"text":"Great food but the place is small so not much room to sit and eat. Recommend the gyoza and spicy salmon"}
{"text":"Love it here! Been here many times now.  Do not mix up this Japango with the one in the Beaches. Not. The. Same.  ATMOSPHERE: Small, classy and cosy. Not good for large parties - unless you can book the whole place for your full party. But it's a great place for a date, or parties of 4.  SERVICE: It's a small place and super busy.  Service has ranged from attentive, to cold (due to high traffic hours). But generally, they're good.  PRICE: Mid to high prices. But such good quality, it's worth it.  FOOD: So good! Fresh fish, and great presentation. I'm a sashimi lover, and the quality of raw fish is the ultimate sign of a good Japanese restaurant. It's great here. I almost always have a sashimi dish of some kind. Also check out their daily specials to see what fresh seafood they have. They sometimes have fresh uni.  Also have tried some of their cooked food as well, like tempura and udons, are all good.  Highly recommend you to also make reservations, if you make plans to go. It's almost always packed in there whether at lunch or dinner! Avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"Best Japanese/sushi place in Toronto. A little expensive, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Very fresh fish and everything we got were tasty! We got the Japango special roll, sashimi platter, and dinner combo. Would come back for sure. It's a very tiny place though so probably better to go when you aren't carrying around thick winter coats. We called for reservations 2 days before for Friday at 7.30 for 3 ppl no problem. Because it's so small, there is a bit of pressure to order and eat and leave quick they don't say it just the way the server is curt and very efficient (not rude though just to be clear)"}
{"text":"I lovelovelove the tempura cold soba and the Japango role! The soba is cooked just right, the dipping sauce tastes just right, it comes with just the right fixin's (quail egg yoke, wasabi, negi, and grated daikon), the tempura is crispy and nicely drained...it's such a perfect hot summer dish! The Japango role is sweet and spicy, with succulent, torched scallop and salmon on top. I basically get the same thing every time.   It goes without saying, though, that getting tempura anything for takeout is not a good idea. I also didn't enjoy the katsudon because the tonkatsu was paper thin. But stick with the rolls, soba, and tempura, and you won't be disappointed.   Tip: The space is super tiny, so try to go at an odd hour to avoid waiting. If you make the same mistake I did and go at a popular time, opting for takeout instead doesn't shorten the wait by much!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 maki platters for my wedding and this restaurant literally used the cheapest ingredients they could possibly make for $250.00 worth of sushi. I called to complain which they only said \"I'm sorry\". I'm so upset I can't even..."}
{"text":"This place has got to be the best sushi restaurant in the city. I have spend many hours and many dollars trying sushi restos all around the city and Japango I can now say is above & beyond all others (which I hate admitting on here because its so small and packed as is) The service the presentation and the quality are unmatched at any other place that I have tried so far.  As mentioned before, the only draw back is that it is a very small place and really not meant for large groups, even 4 can be a push on certain nights."}
{"text":"Sashimi was great and the highlight of my meal was Japango, obviously:) i don't mind be squeezed in the small place, because come on, we are coming here for food:)"}
{"text":"Went on the recommendation of a friend of a friend ( it's complicated!).  Any way, the place was crowded, very small.  I was accommodated in a very small space I nearly choked! I was served a Japanese green tea which was nice.  I ordered Crab/ Shrimp sashimi and sushi.   The Sushi was ok, sashimi was not my favourite to say the least. I had tasted better Japanese food in other places. Honestly, It was a one time experience that I will not do again. But still not a horrible one."}
{"text":"It is an awfully small place here! We arrived at 5:30 and was able to pick any seat in the restaurant.   Unfortunately my friend was not much in the mood for sushi and preferred something fatty and filling (like potatoes and gravy). So we settled for the Katsu don (his) and Sashimi don (mine).  The sashimi don is sashimi on top of rice, there was: salmon, crab meat, halibut maybe?, and very sweet tamago egg. It came with hot sauce on the side, which I poured into my bowl. It was alright, pretty good with the rice... but halfway through I poured in soy sauce and enjoyed that a lot more.  With salmon and rice, sashimi don is pretty filling. Definitely not potatoes + gravy filling, but good enough for a dinner. I didn't find this dish that special.... Although the sashimi is quite fresh, I've had better sashimi don elsewhere.  My friend's katsu don (chicken or pork, with rice. He had chicken) was so-so. We both thought the chicken was a bit plain.   Overall, it's okay food. About $20 (tips, taxes) per person. They have better lunch combos and prices than dinner.  At 7, the tiny restaurant was packed. New customers coming in were told to wait, and those in a hurry snatched up the takeout menu. The staff were extremely nice, they knew we were leaving (and thanked us because they were getting busy) but they didn't rush us AT ALL to pay. In fact, we sat there with our credit cards..... and then realized we were supposed to get up and walk towards the cashier."}
{"text":"It was a cold night and I was not in the mood for wandering the streets around my hotel hoping to find a decent meal and I definitely did not want to take my chances with hotel food. Enter Yelp. Thanks to Toronto Yelpers, I found this great little sushi place that was just around the corner from my hotel. I would never have found it on my own because it's down a dark street that I probably wouldn't have thought to wander down without prompting. After reading how small the place is, I decided just to pop over to place a take out order. Service and sushi were quickly delivered. It wasn't cheap, but it was delicious. If I lived in Toronto, I'd definitely go here all the time!"}
{"text":"What a find!  I'm almost tempted to give a poor review so other people will not want to go here.  (You want to go to one of the \"all-you-can-eat\" sushi places instead...)  First off, be prepared to be disappointed - if you didn't reserve, that is.  A few tables, and small ones at that.  I read the review about \"feel(ing) a little rushed\" but I can't echo that.  Even at dinner, when people keep coming in and out of the door to see if a table has opened (and continue to hang out on the street), they are not pushy.  Next, the sushi.  Wow.  Super fresh, and my favorite is the sashimi dinner.  And the chef does not disappoint.  Beautiful pieces of fish, very fresh, and always something new and interesting.  The japango roll is a must.  All of the nigiri and rolls that I have tried are great, and not overdone with the rice.  If you're in at lunch, grab a bento.  Very satisfying, though the bento box is as big as the table, which brings its' own challenges.  The maps I pulled up didn't show it in the right place, but thanks to friendly locals we found it.  Grateful for that."}
{"text":"Food and service were both excellent, although opening time on yelp was decieiving. We showed up at 11:30 and was told to come back at noon. Restaurant was small and staff wouldn't seat us until everyone arrive."}
{"text":"Pretty good pretty good!! Their specialty roll is pretty good and the servers are nice :)"}
{"text":"Small and cozy. Being a foodie who is really into Japanese foods, I must say Japango is one of the best authentic Japanese restaurant I've been to. Best Chirashi in town! Must try."}
{"text":"A cozy place to eat near the Eaton Centre.  The sushi and sashimi were done very well.  The zaru soba had great balance.  The tempura could have used less time in the batter box.  Would go again for sure."}
{"text":"Yes, FINALLY made it to Japango after reading about it for years. I met up with a friend for lunch today. She suggested to meet at 11:45 to beat the lunch crowd. I got there at 11:45 and there were two tables taken. By the time 12 rolled around, almost all tables were taken. It doesn't take much seeing as they have so little space!  You have just enough space to fit your bag in between yourself and the person at the next table and for us people sitting on the bench, it was like those sliding puzzle games where you move the blocks to get a piece out. Didn't mind it, but found it amusing :D  On to the food... I ordered chirashi because I figured it would give me a good assortment of fish and so I could gauge the quality. It came beautifully adorned with some greens, a dandelion flower (which I ate... bitter!), blob of wasabi and generous serving of pickled ginger. The rice on the bottom was served with bits of seaweed sprinkled over it. The fish looked really good and I liked how instead of just being plain raw fish served on plain rice as some other places do, they were more creative! They lightly pan-seared the tuna, they blowtorched a few items which brought out a great flavour, and they added small bits of deep-fried garlic (it may be shallots) The whole dish tasted amazing. No complaints about any of the raw fish..  the one comment I'll make is that the cold cooked shrimp was the low point of the meal.  Service was great ~  5 min walk from work = i will definitely come back here!"}
