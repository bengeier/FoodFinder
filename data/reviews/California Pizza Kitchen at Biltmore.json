{"text":"Had a great time here on a Saturday night. Service was a bit slow but the food was top notch. As it was our first time dining there the manager brought us a complimentary flatbread. It was so good my wife ordered another one. The BBQ chicken pizza was excellent, and was much more than enough for one person.  But whatever you do- if you go here save room for dessert and get the butter cake (with ice cream!). You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and I have nothing negative to say about it. Staff was friendly. Service was fast. Food was delicious. I love their pizza crust. Its chewy and perfect. They have so many up sells with small plates and stuff, but just stick with a pizza and salad to share."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time: Try Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, Hannys, Z Pizza or even Oreganos. All gourmet pizza with local fare and local products and I've never had an experience like:  I had lunch CPK this afternoon and had a less than desirable experience and I wanted to share it with you. Long-story-short, we ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza without cilantro. The pizza arrived with cilantro. I had one bite after my partner had one piece. After the bite, I notified the server that there was cilantro. He was very accommodating, said that he requested it without cilantro and then hastily rectified the situation by ordering a different pizza.   While we were awaiting the second pizza, the manager arrived at our table to address the situation. He did not offer his name, but immediately apologized for the inconvenience which we appreciated. He, however, continued with informing us that there was no cilantro on the pizza. Then asked us, \"Did you not want scallions on there, because it was scallions on the pizza, not cilantro.\" I informed him that I tasted and saw cilantro, which I had pointed out to the server. He replied with, \"No, they did not put any cilantro on the pizza!\" To which I replied, \"Well I don't know...I didn't put cilantro on the pizza.\" To which he replied, \"Well, the new pizza will be here shortly,\" as he walked away.  I have a few serious issues with this managerial approach. First, it is unprofessional to insinuate that any guest is lying. Second, I find it insulting that he would go on to insinuate that we don't know the difference between scallions and an herb we specifically requested be omitted. Finally, I believe arguing with the guest should be strictly avoided.   Man, what a twat!"}
{"text":"We meet a friend that was in town for dinner at this location last night. Husband, our kid's, our friend and I . As soon as they brought my dinner plate to me which was the chicken fettuccine alfredo, I was like really that's the food. I never have been to a CPK where the food was so little. I ate my whole plate which wasn't that much in it along with three pieces of bread. When we left my husband said I am still hungry he had the shrimp fettuccine.... I said to him what I am writing now. So I wasn't just tripping my dinner plate didn't look full enough like I have experienced before at other California and Nevada Locations. My kid's had the same dinner plate they split it ages son-5 daughter-7 and they finished all of their as well which again wasn't much in it for a Dinner Plate. Not happy would not go back or recommend to hotel guests where I work at. Other then that it was good food as always, just wished it was a bigger portion last night."}
{"text":"Worst tortilla soup have ever experienced! And have lived in Phoenix metro 30 years and order often."}
{"text":"I always have drastically different experiences from that of most people. Maybe being in a family helps...  Got there at 7:30 PM, I guess (long story). We had a very nice and attentive waiter who came back often (they divided the place between waitstaff very well) and made no mistakes.  I chose a cherry limeade for my drink. I was glad to taste an actual lime flavor in a drink for once! Add in the cherry and...need I say more?  My entre√© was the Garlic Chicken pizza which ended up becoming a joke - in a good way (hhhhhello, hhhhhow's your pizza?). It was topped with loads of garlic, onions, and chicken. That's OK, though: I am an onion lover (as well as garlic).  I wanted to try the seasonal Lemon Cake, but I was too darn full...next time.  It took a bit of driving around the Biltmore Fashion Park to find it, but the extra time was worth it. Make sure you look behind the Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I were visiting Phoenix from Vancouver, Canada. We were looking around for places to have dinner, and we saw California Pizza Kitchen. We had never been here and decided to give it a try. We ordered a bowl of soup, Mac and cheese, as well as the Jambalaya to share. We told our server we wanted the Mac and cheese (Appetizer, not even realizing there was a main dish portion as well). He did not bother clarifying with us which one we were referring to. When the order arrived, we were surprise at the large size and made a comment to our server that this is a big portion, and that we thought it would be a smaller size. He said that this is the usual size, and did not bother clarifying that it was not the appetizer we had requested. When our bill came, we were surprised to see that the Mac and cheese had costed us $11 as opposed to $3.99 as stated in the appetizer section. We then informed our server of the mistake and miscommunication, and he agreed and went to rectify the miscommunication. Although this mistake happened, please note, we weren't at all upset at the server. We completely understood mistakes and miscommunications happen, and he had kind enough customer service skills to rectify the situation by changing our bill amount. The part that we were dissatisfied and very surprised by, was the actions of the manager on duty this evening (December 7th, around 8.30pm). This complaint is towards the manager. When the server when to correct the bill, the manager (or we think it was the manager) came out to our table and rudely asked 'what's going on, guys??'. We politely explained to her the situation, and she responded by saying, and I quote, 'so you want to eat the large size Mac and cheese, pack it (we did not finish it), and only pay for the appetizer Mac and cheese??'. We were so offended by her statement, and disbelief in her lack of customer service skills. We left our leftover Mac and cheese that we had packed on the table as we were so upset by this., and promptly left the premise upon paying for our bill. She did not even apologize for her tone and rudeness, or mistake in the bill."}
{"text":"Live nearby this place is always consistent LOVE the California club pizza"}
{"text":"CPK is OK. I do like their Original BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad.  I ordered a \"half\" portion and it was perfect because I had room for the tasty desserts. Seriously, you've got to try the Red Velvet Cake and the Tiramisu if you go there. I was in a sugar coma for a few hours after eating it but that's fine. It was worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza tasted great but crust was like rubber, $30 wasted. Should of went to Humble Pie."}
{"text":"First time here and it was a lot better than I expected! I ordered the jambalaya pasta, it was perfectly delicious! Service was great and the place itself is clean, definitely coming back"}
{"text":"The food was ok... It's pie.  Quite frankly it's overrated.  They also argued with us concerning the check. My wife ordered a Cranberry Cooler drink, with free refills and asked if she could try a different flavor, they said sure. When we got the bill, they overcharged us with an extra drink. We have done this at other restaurants, so the waitress told is she would get it removed. Then comes back and says the manager said he wouldn't remove it, so I asked to speak to the manager. I explained that we were never told it would be an extra charge and we've also done this at other restaurants with no problems. Victor the manager argued with me instead of being apologetic. I asked him who his manager was and he insisted that he was THE Manager. I asked again and he said J.R. He then said he'd comp the drink they overcharged."}
{"text":"The thing about CPK I've noticed over the years, if you want adequate service, show up when it's not busy, because when it IS busy, plan on paying full price for drinks and meals that are completely and utterly lackluster.  CPK, do me a solid, if you run out of garnish for your $7.50 sangria's, let me know. I really look forward to that soaked pineapple and cherry, thank you very much! And please, don't think of it as audacious for me to request a dollar off for your mistake. Bottom line, won't return, and won't recommend this to anyone I love or even just moderately like."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of California Pizza Kitchen. They have many great menu options--just don't be on a low-carb diet. Their pizzas, salads, and sandwiches are all good from my previous experiences. As for this location in particular, expect a bit of a wait Friday-Sunday as this is a popular and centrally located location. I've found the service here to be good, but not always consistent. I frequent this restaurant a lot and while the service is always acceptable and almost always excellent there have been a couple isolated incidences where I feel the service could be a little better."}
{"text":"Excellent service and awesome food!! Love the new look!!! And Allie and Reese are the BEST !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here today for lunch with a friend. The new decor is very nice-though you will have to deal with some flies if the doors are all open. The new bread they are serving has much more flavor and the tostada pizza continues to be great. Topped that all off with excellent service (thanks Allie!)"}
{"text":"Great service and great food too but last time we ordered the cheese pizza for our daughter and it was too crispy for her and hence did not eat any of it,,,but still the ambiance is always good and ofcourse the california veggie roasted pizza is always awesome......I have to give it 5 stars....."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!   The new \"hand-tossed\" christ sucks!!!!  We will never order pizza from here again!  The mac and cheese was good though"}
{"text":"While this CPK is largely like the others, it does have one thing to distinguish it: really terrible service.   I was here for lunch the other day and noticed they have lunch specials where you get a soup or salad and one of a selected number of small pizzas. I ordered one but asked if I could substitute the soup offered for another kind of soup that was on the menu. I told the waitress that I had noted that the soup I wished to substitute cost $0.50 more and that I would gladly pay the additional charge.  She said she could not do that. No substitutions.  So, I asked \"why?\" esp. as I was willing to pay the difference.  Her reply (it's a classic): I might tell other people.  Huh? What? I might tell other people I got what I wanted? That CPK allowed substitutions? That they, too, could get what they want at CPK?And does she really think I have long ranging discussions about my lunch soup choices?  I tried to argue my point, but, quickly, realized that there is no arguing with that sort of unassailable logic.  Yep, I might tell other people."}
{"text":"The salads are a huge hit with me. Order the half portion unless you are very hungry or want to take some home. The blend of ingredients is very well balanced creating a wonderful harmony of flavors in every bite."}
{"text":"Our server Dylan was phenomenal! He made my daughter feel incredibly special and made our lunch date amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Are you serious!!! Stop putting sugar in the gravy!!!! Cali can't do pizza!!!! Nasty!!"}
{"text":"Totally awesome food best service ever never had an empty glass food was on time  hot and fresh  Didn't enjoy what I ordered for the server brought  me something I really wound up enjoying"}
{"text":"The Camelback location has gone rogue.  Take out service is deplorable.  Curbside service is spotty.  One is never sure that they are ever coming out with your order.  They are very slow and confused and cavalier about it.  Maybe change of management is in order.  It always comes from the top.  If they don't acknowledge that they have a problem it will not get fixed.  We have been going there for years and it is just not the same place anymore."}
{"text":"The food at this CPK is pretty good.  I guess you could say that for any of the CPKs, but they always do a nice job at this location and are very accommodating of any special requests.  I realize for the relatively low price you pay, you're not getting top-of-the-line cuisine, but it's a great for what it's intended.  The one negative thing I'd say is skip the wine list.  As you can imagine at a strip-center type chain restaurant, it's not exciting, although the staff actually seem to have a good idea of wine pairing in general for those who are new to wine.  I don't drink beer but have been told by fellow guests the beer selection is decent.  The service at this CPK is pretty good.  There are actually a few servers there that always remember me, even down to what I like to eat, even when it's been six months since I've last been in.  It's very impressive that they remember me and the staff in general (save the host staff when it's busy) is very pleasant."}
{"text":"To start, I love CPK. I have been to multiple locations and the food is always great, same with service. This location? Not so much. We waited 15-20 mins just to get bread and finally our drinks, then took about another 15 for anyone to come and take our actual order. I am actually still sitting here waiting for our order and even asked for more bread and nobody has yet to be here. I am extremely disappointed at this location and the service here.   To sum it all up, DO NOT waste your time going here. Go elsewhere at the Biltmore (cheesecake factory, etc), this location is absolutely dreadful."}
{"text":"This is a good place, It has been here for about 20 years now. Of course over the years we have gone here many times. It is always nice. I stopped in for a to go order on this occasion.  I called from the parking lot at work and then by the time i got there it was almost ready to go.  It is always very good and it smelled wonderful when i arrived. It can be a bit expensive but, it is good food. The salads are wonderful!  Plenty of Parking it is at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food is always good - we love the BBQ chicken chopped salad and the fettuccine add chicken and broccoli - it's good done it or to go - great food at a good price!"}
{"text":"Never had bad service or food.  I been here for lunch and dinner.  It's always filling, from salads, pastas and of course pizza.   I like coming here because it's kid-friendly.  My kids really like it.  I never had an issue or not liked my meal.  Great alternative to Cheesecake Factory if there's a big waiting list."}
{"text":"I had a nice lunch here today. Despite arriving at 12:30 - smack in the middle of the usual lunch rush hour - there was no waiting. The waitress was friendly, and the pizza was pretty good (I went with the classic pepperoni). I haven't been to one of these for well over a decade, but I doubt it'll take me that long to return."}
{"text":"It had been YEARS since I'd been to this CPK & for no other reason other than there were like 5 GREAT pizza places I get to before heading over to the Biltmore. Having said that. The update was needed & looked great. The menu scaled down a bit with a bunch of new items. Everything we tried was good. We all ordered 4 diff things & shared. We came in at happy hour on a Wed & were greeted & seated quickly. We all had beverages just as fast & were very happy with the service. Good to know that CPK has still got it."}
{"text":"I live one minute from CPK and decided to get a to-go order for my friend and I.  The woman placing the order was very nice and professional, I waited the appropriate amount of time and pulled up to the restaurant lots of to-go parking that's a plus I decided not to call the number and have them bring it out to my car, it was a Saturday and I assumed they were busy (I assumed wrong) I was trying to be considerate and not make them rush it out to my car.  Waiting at the to-go station and waiting and waiting employees are looking at me but no one is acknowledging me.  They are not busy and I am standing at the to-go desk with my credit card tapping on the counter and employees keep looking at me, exactly what do they think I am there for? To admire the decor and 90's yellow tile? After about 6 minutes I am getting really angry.  I finally went to the host station because they weren't busy no one was flocking into this establishment in droves.  I asked \"is anyone there to get my order?\" The host went to get someone, ironically the person who came over to help me finally was one of the ones who had been starring in my direction for the past 8 minutes.  I almost lost it when the electronic tab asked me if I wanted to leave a tip, \"here's a tip pay attention\". The pizza it was good the appetizer good but $30 and feeling annoyed, next time I'll spend 1/3 of that buy it at the grocery store and heat it up at home.  I feel like a lot of reviews are in reference to their service over the past few years here's tip #2 read reviews."}
{"text":"A bit pricy for pizza but I'm the kind of guy who like Costco pizza so that's that. Tasted good though. I had the mushroom pepperoni sausage. Not usually a fan of thin crust but the mushrooms were really flavorful."}
{"text":"Food was great however the service was not. We had to ask a manger for a refill because our server was no where to be found. We waited a quite a while for our food, then our appetizer and food came out together."}
{"text":"Well for starters let me say we have always been a huge fan of CPK. However today I had a fly cooked into my shrimp pesto pasta. Super disgusting. Everything else was fine. The manager offered to remove the plate from the ticket. Then I told her ok thank u but that I would post the pictures all over social media and on review sites. She then came back and said she removed the entire ticket. Thank u manager but flies in the kitchen are super disgusting and even more cooked into people's food. Think about it next time you come to CPK biltmore!"}
{"text":"Sands Chevy on Grand Ave in Glendale AZ. First let's start off by telling EVERYONE,The CHEVY TRAXX is the biggest POS that CHEVY ever made $21,000 and has been in their service center 3 times in past 4 mo.I have only had TRAXX for 4 mo.1st for eng.light ( knocking sensor) service tried too say bad gas, fluctuating temps out side,then when I showed I only put premium gas(have receipts) MAT the service manager finally said we don't know.,2nd time was for(MY LINK) that is computer system runs all electronics,the system froze up and only way to fix,detatch positive cable and re-boot.,did tis 3 times in one week took it back to SANDS CHEVY SERVICE,Again MAT comes back to me and says we can not duplicate the issue,(Wich seems the common excuse for all that goes wrong with this POS).I would never recommend a CHEVY,or SANDS CHEVY for anything.today 6.21.18 at 330pm everything went black on dash as well as the MY LINK system.again CHEVY has no answer to this issue.SERVICE TECS are a joke if it can't be figured out by their computer system it can't be duplicated,they are dumb founded.AGAIN CHEVY TRAXX IS THE BIGGEST P.O.S,I will never buy a CHEVY again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nor recommend some one too do the same.this star is cause it will not let me post.they get a negative 10"}
{"text":"I've never given a 1 star review before. We came here tonight with my husband's family for Mother's Day. We were celebrating his mom of course, & myself as I'm pregnant with our first baby. We had a reservation & were seated with no problems. They seemed busy but there were still open tables the entire time we dined. We had two waitresses & at first everything was going smoothly. Got our drinks quickly, orders placed once all the menus were closed. I've been to other CPK's & across the board the food is good. Tonight I ordered the Garlic Cream Fettuccine + mushrooms. It was exactly what I wanted! After dinner we ordered 3 desserts & all were delicious! The reason I'm giving 1 star is because of the service. One waitress, Ryan, was really great! Friendly, personable & helpful! The other, Ray, came by at some point to ask if we needed anything else & if we wanted dessert. My husband asked if she could take some of the empty plates & told her we would definitely get dessert but we'd wait until his mom was done eating. She took a couple plates as she ROLLED HER EYES! I couldn't believe it. It was so incredibly rude! Everyone at the table witnessed it & it was extremely uncomfortable. My husband was not being unkind by any means. We were there to enjoy the holiday, we planned to & did stay a long time. I don't know if she took offense to his request or his answer to her question, that yes we would be ordering dessert? But being so outrightly unprofessional & to our faces, was uncalled for. As dinner went on service became slower & less available. We had to ask for refills, stop other servers walking by to ask for water. Overall it ended up being really disappointing & a terrible experience, especially on Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"Went to the scotsdale rd location a few days ago.  When we were seated I noticed a very bad odor immediately.  I went to the hostess and asked to be seated away from location.  The next booth wasn't quite as bad.  After we we're done eating the table next to us was being cleaned off because the people had left. There again was that horrible spoiled dirty smell.  It was then I knew the bus man was using a very dirty contaminated rag to clean all the fables.  As we left I ask where the manager was and the hostess said he was at the back of the restaurant.  So I told her to Inform him of the problem.  I should have told him myself.  So needless to say I was very disappointed .  I go to the Chicago location and have never had a problem.  .  Don't think I could go there again."}
{"text":"Very good California Pizza Kitchen location, one of the best I've been to. If you're a beer drinker, ask about any specials on tap. This is one of the largest CPK locations I've been to as long as the patio is open. I'd say stick with the pizza rather than the pasta, also the pizza is far better with the honey wheat crust. There is usually a mushroom pizza which is the best choice."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this restaurant! The only thing that bothers me about this place is deciding what to order! Mango tea is the best my salad is always fresh and crisp! I normally come after the busy lunch hour it is well kept and the staff is always on top of things."}
{"text":"The food was great, although my only complaint against this location is our server named Courtney was extremely rude and only showed any friendliness towards my friend and I because the manager was in the building. First time at a California Pizza Kitchen but the worst service I've had in my life from a waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"Just came back from a great lunch with my boyfriend at CPK. The food was great, and the service was even better. We had 2 different servers both waiting on us, and we were never without bread or refills, and orders were taken promptly. Sebastian was one of our servers, and he was very personable. We discovered we have a lot in common with him. ;) Our female server was fantastic as well, but we didn't catch her name. We will definitely be back, and soon. Thanks for a great afternoon."}
{"text":"We've been to other CPK's before, but this was the first time at this location.  The food was great.  The pasta was a perfect al dente and the pizza was delish.  Our waitress was great, very helpful and sweet."}
{"text":"I don't really know why this place doesn't get packed to the point where there's a waiting list. The food is phenomenal! My favorite thing to eat are the salads especially the warm grilled vegetable salad with carne assada pizza or chicken tequila fettuccine hmmm amazingly delicious! The service is fast efficient super friendly staff waiters know their menus well. I think CPK need to step up their looks they need to make it sunny like California warm & inviting at the same time rich in decor add color & style for God's sake if  these guys made their place look like a million bucks they could be best everybody else."}
{"text":"because of work and school I did not get chance to go since last year.today I went to macy's exchange something and close by Californian pizza kitching.as usual the avocado club egg is the best.I did take out serivce was great the girl who doing register is very nice.over all good food and good customer  service,I love it?"}
{"text":"This is a great CPK!! It has recently been fully renovated and feels much more upscale than the CPKs I've been to in the past. The food was really delicious. We are not huge pizza eaters so we shared a flatbread app a big salad that was absolutely delicious and the chimichurri (sp?) chicken, which was also really amazing!! I highly recommend it. The staff was wonderful and friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here about one time per week.  I love their salads and this location never has a wait.  The butter cake is awesome."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm being generous, but CPK is an okay place for unique pizza. I've always enjoyed their Santa Fe pizza, but this time I thought I'd try their Greek pizza. It was o-k. Nothing special. Too many veggies, without enough meat, cheese and Tzatziki sauce to counter-balance it.   What really bothered me was that they sat my sister and me right behind the kitchen. I don't think they should even have a table right there. I saw everything that was going on in there. Plus, I kept hearing the servers complaining to their boss about shit. One girl was saying something about another server \"not liking her.\" I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria. And, to top it off, it was FREEZING in there. It is never a good idea to have it soooo cold, that your patrons want to get the hell out of there to warm up!  But, besides my few complaints, it is a fine establishment, although it could definitely improve. I'm sure I'll go back again. But, maybe the next time,I'll stick with my old stand by -- the Santa Fe."}
{"text":"CPK is always a safe move. You'll always be able to find something you want on the menu that's quality at a decent price.   I've had just about everything. The pasta, the pizza, the sandwhiches the salads. You name it, all have been great.   This past time I went I decided on the garlic chicken and vegetables and it was really solid. Two big pieces of chicken served with sliced potatoes and some roasted vegetables all with a garlic sauce. The chicken was really tender and this made for a great, healthier dish."}
{"text":"Doesn't rate even one star. Hostess was nice enough and sat us right away. Waiter came to us twice within one minute and told us, \"just so you know, if you don't order soon, the kitchen closes at nine.\" Ummmmm... Why were we seated????? Why wouldn't you just turn people away at the door? Glad it didn't make it in Tucson. Phoenix will learn...."}
{"text":"We decided to come to California Pizza with some friends.  There pizza is pretty good for being a chain restaurant.  Our waitress was really sweet and hope us with pick out a pizza from their menu.  We decided to get the Meat Cravers.   We even had dessert, that normally does not happen,  but since there was four of us,  we split the new s'more dessert.  The s'mores desert was not all that great,  it was to salty and tasted like it came from a instant pudding box."}
{"text":"Came here on quite a busy night. We were seated fairly fast and had very nice service.    We got a peach and chicken salad and a pizza. Not the thin crust the thick one. Mushrooms are always good here. We had extra mushrooms on the Pizza. Lots of parking resonable price."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I love the Margherita is the greatest thing since sliced bread!! I come here when I can, it's expensive but so worth it!"}
{"text":"CPK is fun.  The parking is a challenge unless you want to walk a bit or wait a bit. I like the pizzas and the service is always good."}
{"text":"This review is for service received on June 24th. We put our name on the list in order to get in \"line\" for a table ahead of arriving at the restaurant. When my wife and I arrived, we were seated by the assistant manager. We let her know that we had three more in our party. My wife and I ended up waiting an hour and our dining companions never showed up.   It turns out that they arrived a few minutes before us and were seated on the far back side of the restaurant. We weren't able to get in touch with them because the adult of the other party had a phone that was dead.   As we waited for the other party, we just decided to order the appetizers and entrees. I ordered a steak done medium well. When it arrived, the outside was super over-done and the inside was raw. Lastly, the waiter who was taking care of us had another table with 15 people and we were pretty much ignored except for when he brought the food.    Thanks to the CPK and a lack of staff coordination, a long drive from Tucson to meet friends for dinner resulted in the terrible outcome. I am not returning to any of these franchises... this should not have happened."}
{"text":"I am not really a fan of CPK but I went here with a colleague as it was close by where we were working. I figured I would just go with a basic pizza (thin crust) and was less than impressed. For thin crust it was pretty soggy and for me that is a deal breaker. Service was good and friendly but the pizza sub-par IMO. Maybe the other items are better, but I thought I was safe going with a plain pie."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of CPK after trying their pizza a couple times.  While the food was much better this time around, it's just not my thing.  We had what they are calling their Mini Plates (AKA, they bring it out to you faster):  a guacamole corn dip, a wedge salad, and an arugula/asparagus salad.  Those were pretty good actually!  For dinner, my friend and I shared a plate of their 5 (or maybe it was 4) cheese ravioli with the added sauteed mushrooms.  It wasn't bad!  A bit strong on the sage side, but not bad at all.  Although...it came out within about 8 minutes of us ordering it...so really CPK isn't exactly gourmet since it isn't made from scratch.    It's not a place I'd pick out of so many other fantastic places in the valley, but my friend had a gift certificate and we enjoyed our plates of food plenty!"}
{"text":"I'm hungry after a long day so decided to order CPK from door dash. I love door dash. It's a good delivery service and, from my location I've got options that include some of the top steakhouses in town! Goodbye forever, suburbia... I've had cpk many times before and I know my dasher got here way ahead of schedule (as always!), but tonight's pizza was minimally edible. Thai chicken has always been good but this location served me a cardboard, microwave heated version of the classic. Boo. Two stars because I'm starving and it's food."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and absolutely love it! Great service. Didn't even have to ask for drinks since they were so quick to bring them every time we needed a refill! Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Decent service for decent price. Wait staff was understaffed and there was a confusion with our order, but drinks were discounted because of the issue."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for what it is. A bit more smoke and mirrors than actual quality. It is not a bad place. Food is good, but there are much better places close by that are a bit better.   If you need some pizza pretty quick and your and in the biltmore area, and you want a classy joing, then this is the place...  have fun"}
{"text":"Not my \"cup of tea\" -- too Yuppie for me!  Atmosphere way too \"sanitized\", and servers have little or no personality.  The food is fair but not worth the price IMHO!  What ever happened to pasta or pizza with RED sauce?  Seems they have every color and concoction known to man except red (well maybe one or two)- being of Italian descent I need red!!  I ordered from  the \"Small Bits Menu\" because I wanted a light lunch - believe me - it definitely was \"Small Bits\",  good thing they gave out bread because I needed a second helping of that just to let me know that I ate something!  My suggestion is to order from the dinner menu if you want a full meal - of course most folks are much more sophisticated than this old country boy and can figure out what most of the fancy California stuff is on the menu - sorry!"}
{"text":"Just not a fan  I went last week, they had some new menu items I got the buffalo chicken pizza Eh  I'd rather go to Piezanos, or NYPD.    Although, I have so many friends who LOVE this place.  I just don't get it."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for a bit, seemed like the bartender was on the phone taking some sort of order. It's 12:30 on a Sunday - they should be more prepared. There was lots of towards the rear doing nothing. After several minutes of no greeting, no water, no drink, no service I decided to just leave and go next door to The Cheesecake Factory. Was instantly greeted there and got my drink within seconds. I told the bartender at CKF how they just won my business over CPK - due to poor service there - and he said he would thank them next time. Funny guys. Disappointed in CPK."}
{"text":"Has really gone downhill.  I've enjoyed their salads for years, but lately they are just not up to par.  Then, my mom brought home a salad and it was truly not edible.  Salad mix looked like something old from under the lawnmower and wantons were soggy (it was not dressed yet.)  Went back to show the manager the uneaten salad and guess what?  Nada.  Zip.  Not even a \"Hey, can we make you a new one or get you a certificate for a salad the next time you come in?\"  Wow.  I was speechless.  So now CPK = bad food AND bad customer service.  No thank you.  I'm done with CPK. Tonight we are going to try a non-chain, foodie spot (and Phx is now loaded with them.)"}
{"text":"Neither great, nor bad I think that is how all chains get 3 stars. Their menu is craftily made by a test kitchen making sure not to offend any pallet. In the process they don't  seduce anyone mouth either.  I frequently had lunches delivered from here to meetings, and I also dined in the restaurant too.   For delivery I quickly learned to stay away from anything with a dough component, from egg rolls to pizza it was always Luke warm and soggy by time I sunk my teeth in to it.  One of my preferred dishes for both delivery and in store dining is the Thai Linginni. It is a basic Italian linguine covered in a garlicky, peanut sauce, there are is some bean sprouts and carrots in the mix. However I do have to add a large amount of red pepper to this dish to have adequate flavor for me.  This is also one of the cheaper items on the menu.  I have also tried the salmon when I was trying to be healthy, however it was clear that their blacking process involved a good amount of butter.  As for the pizzas there is a eclectic mix of pizzas topped with items not traditionally seen on pizza, at least until the California pizza scene had effected out world.  I opt for the mushroom pizza. It is a sourceless style pizza with a \"mushroom pesto\" that is quite earthy and greasy.   Included with a meal is bread and butter, the Italian bread here is fairly good with firm crust and airy body."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in, until the moment I left, I felt welcome. I was greeted by smiling faces and it continued until we were on our way out the door. The Manager, Dan, was so pleased we decided to come in (it was our first time) and he even gave us a complimentary appetizer! Our food was cooked to perfection, the server kept our drinks full....the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. The only thing they could improve on is the way they walk through the restaurant. They were walking in between all the tables, instead of using the walkway they have already. Other than that, I love this place! Friendly staff, relaxed environment, great food....what else can you ask for? Would recommend 100%"}
{"text":"By far the RUDEST customer service at this place. The hostesss was nice and seated us , but the server anissa, was super rude and not only got the order wrong but gave us attitude for mentioning it. She failed to at least fix it or make it up. NOT once did she check up on us Without us having to wave her down and when she did she would smell like if she just took a weed smoke break, I will not be returning to this location for the POOR service received by this young girl Anissa"}
{"text":"I am in love and it's with a restaurant. I came here after a difficult week to treat myself to a fancy lunch. I ordered the soup and sandwich combo-on the weekend you can't get the deal price though FYI. It was of course delicious. If it's your first time here try the pizza though, BBQ chicken is my favorite.  They have a nice wine selection, I really likes the house chard. You can order a regular or large sized glass.   I say at the bar and talked to the bar tender who was super sweet and didn't make me feel like a big loser for sitting alone.  This is a great location for a wonderful restaurant, I will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"What do you want CPK to do, back flips when you stroll in for lunch?   Mix things up a little, how?  You dont see Applebees or Olive Garden \"mixing it up,\" do you?  No, because its a chain and one is exactly like another, the food is the same, the place is set up the same.   This is the nature of the chain restaurant beast, so if you dont like it, still to pricey Old Town or NoSco trendy hotspots.  Nothing wrong with either one, just know what you like and what youre getting yourself into.  I'm not quite sure where my rant and thus love for CPK has come from, except that every time I go, I have a good experience.  Food comes out fast (I always have the margerita pizza), service is quick(they know how to handle a large lunch crowd) and overall, everything is consistently good.    So they dont have a circus performing for your lunchtime entertainment.  I dont think they need it."}
{"text":"I agree with Jake...Mediocre at best....  Boring layout and unkempt when busy....Busy frequently! Finding a seating area off the main path is a plus!  The main path feels and looks like an over sized hallway...Beware!  I have been to other CPK's and this one is layed out poorly compared to others I've been to (San Luis Obispo in California, San Francisco in the Business District, and one in Scottsdale close to Bell and Scottsdale Blvd.---Very nice!)  At this particular location, service was a disaster this past Wednesday evening after work 02-13-08.  ----The two dishes ordered were: Tomato Basil Spaghettini with goat's cheese, and the second dish was Fettuccine with Garlic Cream Sauce with Chicken.  Both dishes came out at the same time---The Tomato Basil Spaghettini was warmish, at best...The Garlic with Cream Sauce with Chicken had no Chicken! ---(had to be returned to the kitchen) .  I asked the waiter to please return mine to a hot oven or lamp so that I could begin at the same time as my guest...  All this time the waiter acted as if he were doing us a favor, as if we were disturbing him from sorting his receipts from his other poorly served customers!  When the food finally arrived, my dish was even colder, just mildly warm!#!$#!    I recommend that if you are out to impress a guest in any capacity, this is not that place to take them...Go next door to the Cheesecake Factory!  I'm not sure about the service, but the whole layout at least,  looks inviting and clean."}
{"text":"I'm sad that I have to give this place a one star since I love going here. But it was such a disappointment. We sat at our table, sitting down I noticed we were given dirty utensils. I asked for new ones and was never given any, so I had to get up and get it from another table myself.   We weren't given any complimentary bread at all.  Also, the waiter was not engaging. He just stood there and made the situation uncomfortable. After we ordered our drinks finally came. Then our food came however, the waiter got my order wrong since he didn't write it down.  We asked for straws and didn't get them until 15 minutes later.    Just a horrible experience."}
{"text":"We had to stop by the Apple store to replace my phone so we decided to head to CPK for lunch. It's been quite sometime since my boyfriend and I both had been to one so it sounded like a good idea.  We got seated right away as it was just lunch time on a Sunday and it wasn't to busy. We were instantly helped and our server took our drink orders. He also asked if we wanted bread and oli which we declined (as we knew we'd be eating enough carbs). He promptly brought us our drinks and what I loved about it I ordered a flavored ice tea to which he suggested me trying before adding any sweetener in it as they use syrup to make the flavors. It was perfect as is. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni pizza and the waiter wanted to make sure he was okay with the oregano and spicy pepperoni they now use (which he was), I had the chicken tequila fettuccine w/extra cilantro. As he was putting in the order he turned to just confirm I wanted extra cilantro which I did.   The manager brought our food over in less than 10 minutes and it was perfect! About 1/4 of the way down on my ice tea our server brought me another one.   The server asked if we wanted any desert which we were stuffed anyways. My boyfriend and I both said this was one of the best service we had received from any restaurant in a long time. As we left my boyfriend mad a point to tell the manager how great the service was."}
{"text":"Terribly slow service! I ordered curbside pickup from work today. The pick up time they gave me was 1:45 pm. I was there at 1:40 and called to let them know. My order didn't come out until 2:05...20 minutes late! I was late getting back to work and when I opened it 5 minutes later, it wasn't even hot! I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Beware of curbside pickup! Had a large order but computer told me time to arrive so I did. Food wasn't ready, told me to wait. 20 mins later received my order.  My pizza's were burnt and crust black! So when my pizza ready, they kept them still in the oven until my pasta was ready! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"First off, the service was absolutely fantastic and genuine, which creates a great environment from the start. The roasted garlic chicken pizza tasted great, but the butter cake stole the show."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised with how good the service and Chinese chicken salad was at lunch. Far better than the CPKs back home in SoCal. Way to go Phx AZ !"}
{"text":"Have been coming to this location for a really long time usually service is exceptional and the food is absolutely delicious, this time however we got there took about 5 whole minutes for anyone to acknowledge us and seat us then once sat down we ordered our drinks immediately got them pretty fast after that it was pretty much a waiting game took about 25 minutes to have someone take our order and bring our bread then once we placed the order ate and finished eating the server gave us the check and completely forgot about us I waved her down she looked straight at me and never came it wasn't until 30 minutes after I got tired of waiting and I had to go track her down to have her run our cards so we could get going. A very loyal disappointed customer."}
{"text":"I like the black bean chicken BBQ salad. That's about all I ever order. I really haven't tried anything else on the menu. But they do good fam size take out orders with my fav salad."}
{"text":"I can't knock them. Any restaurant that shows appreciation for military and veterans is cool in my book.   The pizza wasn't bad, nor was the service. I like what they've done with the place too. Dressed it up a bit. Thank you CPK."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give one star. Horrible service by Nia. We waited almost half an hour just for just bread, and then we waited over an hour for them to make our Caesar salads. How long does it take to make three salads ?? She ignored us and was very rude. The manager didn't have much to say when we decided to get up and leave either. Don't come here and DON'T have Nia as your server. We were already on a time crunch and they wasted our time without even getting any food! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Waiter was friendly, however, that did not make up for the quality of food.  First time in a CPK, was not thoroughly impressed with the food.  Was there with a group of approx. 8 folks, so we got to try a couple of different items.  The food wasn't horrible, just wasn't worth the money spent.  I would rate this place closer to 2.5 stars, just wasn't what I was expecting or looking for.  Would probably pass the next time someone suggests California Pizza Kitchen.  The apple crisp was pretty good though, so I might go back for that. ;)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the customer service from Courtney was one of the best she is amazing!! Also the manager of the restaurant came out and greeted us as our first time guests and treated us with a special entree free of charge. So after all this restaurant is definitely a 5 star  I recommend this highly"}
{"text":"I have been here on and off for years.  I am always a fan of the sician pizza.  YUM!  Love the thin crust.  The service is always good."}
{"text":"I love CPK and Im not afraid to admit it. Favorite dish is the chopped salad..its tossed in dressing when it gets to you..and the perfect amount as it should be! None of this dressing on the side crap which I hate. They never give you enough and its impossible to mix it evenly.UGH.. pet peeve. Anyway, back to CPK..great variety of pizzas if you're into foo foo pizzas like Ham & swiss, scampi, BLT, etc.. Ive never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Our first visit to the Camelback CPK location was unfortunately not up to standards. I voiced my concerns on my survey and Yelp because my husband and I have always enjoyed our visits to CPK and thought they should know.   Management took the feedback seriously and appear to have made some changes since last visit. This time we ordered the tortilla soup and baked potato soup. I'm not usually a fan of potato soups, but we would definitely order it again!   We ordered our favorite avocado rolls which I have to say these were the best ones we had to date and better than last time - they were incredibly fresh and vibrant.   My husband ordered the Thai pizza. I'm usually a traditional style pizza lover, but had a taste and have to say it was surprisingly amazing. It reminds me of chicken satay on pizza. I ordered the works which was delicious! Lots of oregano and veggies and meat. The crust was perfect and crispy and light on both pizzas. We really wanted to get to dessert, but didn't even make it through the pizzas. Leftover CPK pizza is the best.  Our waiter this time was phenomenal, his name is Joel, make sure you get him. He is very considerate, personable, and helpful. He is attentive when it comes to removing dishes and makes sure food gets out to you right away.   Thank you Camelback CPK team for a great visit. I really love to see companies who take customer feedback seriously!"}
{"text":"Had a recent meal at CPK and was a little bit disappointed. They're usually a good choice if you don't have any better plans. Started with tomato bisque which was hot and yummy. The disappointment came from their signature BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza could have used another 2-3 minutes in the oven as the dough was a bit undercooked and chewy. Not to the point that i couldn't eat it, but it wasn't as good as it could have been. Service was fine. The restaurant was fairly quiet on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing and the service never lets me down. I've ordered for delivery and curb side and both transactions were seamless and quick.  I always get the fettuccine Alfredo with sundried tomatoes and also the Chinese chicken salad."}
{"text":"I tried their cauliflower crust pizza, great flavor, although I later learned it's moderate and not low carb, which is still positive. The 2 stars are based on service. I showed up by myself, and it took a while for them to come and help. I wasn't dirty or dressed badly, but I was in my sports outfit. The lady who first came says: \"Can I ...help you?\" But like saying, \"who are you and what do you want?\" Like she was suspicious of me being there, I even have to ask: \"This is a restaurant, right?\" I had already had a bad day, she didn't help at all. Would I go back? Probably, but it's sad that they're super nice to some, and don't give a rat's rear end about others."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. The traditional and original barbecue chicken chopped salad. I had the sesame chicken dumplings as an appetizer but I ate them so fast I didn't get a picture!"}
{"text":"If you have been to one CPK, you have more or less been to all of them. I went through a stretch when I really liked it here and I still don't mind it, I guess I just don't get excited about it anymore.   The BBQ Chicken pizza is my go-to but the Thai variations are tasty, as well. The appetizers are ok, the service is ok, but it all just seems a little played out to me.   I am waiting for CPK to make some moves, shake things up, add something interesting to the menu, because I feel like nothing has changed there since 1992.   I'll still drop in from time to time, but I won't be as excited about it as I used to be."}
{"text":"For the price range the pizza here is delicious and the drinks at the bar are also impressive kudos to the bartender. I've had a lot of good memories in this place it's a great location and the food is so good. The only thing they need to bring back is the Thai Pizza that's my only one complaint because that was my favorite."}
{"text":"California Fields Salad w/ Shrimp was refreshing & full of flavor!!! Let's not forget the butter cake"}
{"text":"Look, I realize it's not cool to admit you like CPK. I'm OK with that, because they have one of the most crave-worthy salads ever: the tricolore salad, composed of spring mix and arugula with a light vinaigrette, huge pieces of shaved Parmesan, and chunks of tomato, all served on a warm Parmesan-encrusted pizza crust. I think the whole thing really defeats the purpose of a salad, but the hell with it. Finish off the gluttony with their flourless chocolate cake, served warm with vanilla bean goo on top. OMG heaven."}
{"text":"I used their catering services for a corporate training we were holding in our office. It was supposed to be delivered at noon. At 11:55, I received a call letting me know they were running a \"few minutes\" behind. Fast forward 35 minutes later, I am sitting on hold with them for 10 minutes trying to find out where our food is. The gal on the phone was rude and acted like I was out of line by asking where it might be.  I guess I just assumed a chain as large as CPK would have their act together when it comes to these things. Instead they didn't offer an apology or ANYTHING. We definitely won't be using them for corporate catering again, or anything else for that matter."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone was really friendly and the atmosphere is great! I went specifically to try the new spicy buffalo cauliflower appetizer and I have to say, it is AMAZING! (If you like spicy, like I do). If you're second guessing whether or not you want to try it (maybe you're not that big of a cauliflower/veggie person) I would say that you definitely have to try it! It isn't like you're eating veggies. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Service slowwwwww and not too attentive. Hostess wanted to sit us in the worse table-a booth next to restroom-no thanks!  Waiter took forever to stop by-but he was friendly.  His helper was busy and forgot to bring us out to-go boxes!  Garlic Fetuccini will leave you with dragon breath-why did they take the Alfredo off the menu? I won't order this again.  The rest of the food pizza, salad, appetizer rolls, average. But the downer was the service."}
{"text":"Let me start off this post by saying I am a huge CPK fan. I have found multiple dishes that I love and am never disappointed.   This location is absolutely beautiful. They really did an amazing job putting it together. That being said, I visited on a Monday afternoon and received amazing service. Really, so quick too! Maybe because it was empty but sometimes you get worse service when that is the case.  CPK offers bread free with some oil and their bread is delicious. On this trip, I ordered the B-B-Q chicken salad and it is one of my favorites... Always delicious and fresh!  Really, my favorite part of this CPK was the layout. It really gives you a great environment to be able to sit, relax, and enjoy a nice meal. You must check out this location!"}
{"text":"I have always loved this restaurant, but this trip out was exceptional. Our server, Spencer, was extremely helpful and basically helped us pick our entire meal.  I got the creamy pesto and they were willing to kick the heat up for me. My friend got the Jambalaya and absolutely loved it. Both recomend by Spencer. Got the S'mores for dessert and that was a great way to end the meal."}
{"text":"I can't believe they pay a person to stand at the front door to make sure you don't park in the spots for food pick up.  They attack you as soon as you get out of your car."}
{"text":"Vegan options are not labeled on the menu and they have very few options for being a vegetarian friendly restaurant. We get the California veggie pizza without cheese, the roasted vegetable salad (substitute hoisin ginger dressing because the balsamic has egg in it), and the Dakota split pea and barley soup. Service is good and both food and service are consistent, just wish there were more options."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome dinner at CPK. We eat at CPK all the time in Boston. But our experience was phenomenal thanks to our waiter, Dillon. We had a large party with 5 kids and he made the dinner a total breeze. Ask for Dillon. The best!"}
{"text":"We went to CPK by the Biltmore expecting a take out pizza with some apps and cocktail while we waited. We were happy to find ourselves being waited on by Maddie behind the bar. She was fun, informative, and spunky! Just the kind of attitude we love in food service. She joked with us, took our photos and had lots of recommendations for us indecisive crazies! She was enthusiastic about congratulating us on our recent engagement and even brought us out the most fabulous desert to celebrate! It was some kinda little mousse shot. Anyways, the food was great. The service was fantastic. We would definitely recommend going to this location and requesting Maddie to wait on you. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was great, my boyfriend had the pizza and I had the steak... believe it or not, it was the best I have had in a long time! Not something I would expect for somewhere known for its pizza. Even though everything we had was delicious, the five stars are for the great customer service we received from the moment we walked in until the time that we left."}
{"text":"Much better than the frozen variety.  Sort of better than the quick serve shop in the Fashion Mall in Vegas- from what I remember.  This place was just as I was expecting: way crowded at lunch time, over-priced pizza and drinks, and so-so service.  The pizza I had with wheat crust that included eggplant, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese was pretty tasty.  I guess if you consider that I had a second meal out of the pizza, the price wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Don't  waste your money! I would never recommend this location . whatever you do don't order the gluten free pizza. over cooked ours they remade second one was to go. joke was on us  when we got home. that one was worse .!  i threw this out! lazy manager never refunded card  like he said he would he lied. should be working at a gym . not with food . complaints to HQ"}
{"text":"I can't say that I absolutely am sold on CPK man I want too but every time I get something I am not blown away. The last time was better and the pizza was good but it didn't blow the show away what did was the waldorf salad. And for a pizza place....the pizza should win the show. I'll still give it another shot tho!"}
{"text":"Rodney the waiter messes up the orders ALL of the time.  Every food I have tried at CPK has been nothing but yummy, but this waiter really ruins the dining experience. I give the food 5 stars, but I give my experience at this place 2 stars, all because this particular waiter screws up our orders consistently.  One time, we ask for the bread..the bread never comes out, just our meals.   another time, I ask for extra sauce on the side of my salad, never came out  another time, I asked for no peanuts in my salad - it was filled with peanuts  this last time was the topper -  ordered an appetizer, and it never arrived. I also asked for no tortilla strips in my soup - it comes out loaded with tortilla strips. And when we got our bill at the end of lunch, we told him that our appetizer never came out because we wanted to make sure we didn't get charged for it, and he pulled out the order he had written and confirmed that it wasn't even written down!  it's the same guy EVERY time - I don't know how this guy still works there and why I keep being the unfortunate one always falling into his area, but I am not dining at this location anymore - much too stressful"}
{"text":"No discounts offered to our Military Veterans or Senior Citizens.  This restaurant is too trendy and needs to pay more attention to their clientele.  This is an atmosphere that did not seem family friendly.  The atmosphere was for yuppy young people that have nothing better to do than have a slow meal and drink their cares away.  No thanks.  Food taste was average.  Service also average.  McDonald's is close by,"}
{"text":"I can't actually rate the food because we left before it got that far.   Drinks and service were horriable - not to mention the fact that it was like 100 degrees in there. Ohh and they  seem to have worked very hard in the design to  fit the absolute max amount of people per square foot with zero regard for comfort. There are tables jammed into every possible space."}
{"text":"I mean, this place has been around forever and its one of those places, at least for me, that I always pass up. until tonight- we came in for dinner and I was so surprised how nice it was inside and how great the food was. Totally yum!"}
{"text":"Ive lived in the area for 13 years and I myself have never eaten at CPK. Ive always thought of them being known for Pizza...and my favorite type of pizza is cheesy and greesy so I never bothered. One day a client brought me an amazing huge salad that impressed me...and inspired me to go alone for lunch on another day. I stopped in in work clothes (workout gear & a bun). They were so polite at the front. They asked if I had been there before and I answered no. Well they welcomed me like they had been expecting me! My salad was filling and just as good as the first I had. With many other options to choose from. I was impressed by the menu. Why have I deprived myself for so long?  As I am eating, a man I presume to be a manager comes over to say \"hi\" and that he had heard I had never eaten there before, greeted me, asked what I thought of the place and food and wished me well. Did they think I was an inspector maybe? LOL. I felt like a celebrity! It made me wish I had dressed a little nicer for my lunch date with myself. Anyway...Ill be a regular."}
{"text":"Let it be said this review is solely for the (lack of) customer service in this location. We love CPK and frequent the desert ridge location in North Phoenix. We were deeply disappointed however in the lack of attention--our appetizers never came at all and when we questioned this upon receipt of our entrees the kitchen was blamed and we were told they'd \"rush it out\"...the appetizers never arrived, the waters were never filled and despite voicing our frustrations, nothing was done to rectify the overwhelmingly poor experience.  I'm sticking with Desert Ridge from now on.."}
{"text":"Nightmare on Camelback and 24th Street!  I have frequented this restaurant since I can remember and even have the phone number memorized since the 80s. What a disappointment.  When three other restaurants in the vicinity had a 40+ minute wait due to Father's Day, this store was empty. Maybe four tables were occupied. We found a nice spot and proceeded to order a glass of wine. After waiting 15 minutes and told the wine would arrive anytime on 4 different occasions, the waitress said they were looking for a wine glass. Really??? There were maybe 10 people in the restaurant over 21. So we proceeded to order our food not having the wine delivered.  After waiting an obnoxiously long time our food finally arrived as did the wine. We were told they had to wash the wine glass. The split pea and tortilla soups were coagulated beyond a stew and not edible! The wonton chicken and avocado wraps were horrible at best and tasted even worse than they appeared and my \"go-to\" half barbecue chicken chopped salad  was disgusting. What happened CPK?  What happened to the high energy vibe, shiny clean environment, efficient staff and consistent food?  I couldn't even find a manager after asking for one. After decades, I will never go back to the barn styled restaurant with disgusting food and underwhelming staff. Bye bye CPK!i"}
{"text":"Since we still have gift card credit from Christmas... We try to use it here and there...  The last time we went to the Tempe Marketplace one and our visit was horrible... The only + out of that experience was that we were using a gift card haha  Tonight however  Alex took great care of us... He was very nice and attentive...   I ordered a Mai Tai and water with lemon... For my meal, I ordered a pizza... And I ate it all haha I was hungry  The food was good!   We also had the Belgian souffl√© dessert and it was excellent! So rich!   But we enjoyed the service by far compared to the other location...  Thanks Alex for taking care of us and for making our next \"CPK\" dinner location to be set!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza places. Cater to our wheat crust fascination and my son loves there pineapple BBQ chicken pizza. Little hard to find close parking on a Friday night but the desert was well worth the walk. The service is always nothing less then stellar."}
{"text":"Since I'm off the pizza kick for a while, I only ordered veggie appetizers at CPK and a slice of pumpkin cheesecake.   Short story shorter: I couldn't tolerate either.   The shishito peppers were so oily I couldn't get the sheen off. Yeughk.   Fried mac and cheese was deplorable. They look like fritters but taste like sea sponges.  Pumpkin pie was pedestrian.   Not this time, CPK, Not this time.  You might win some, but you just lost one."}
{"text":"I'm a one dish wonder here.  What I like, I give four stars here; if I were rating their entire menu I would probably give it three.  We share the California Egg Rolls - which are scrumptous!  They're filled with chicken, cheese, bacon and avocado.  Love the dressing they are served with.  Then I get a 1/2 salad - past couple of times it has been the Cobb, but sometimes the Field Greens.  Also delicious."}
{"text":"Went here last night and I'm impressed that if you don't like something,  they take it back and replace it. Turned out nice because the potato soup was gritty and my original margarita was spicy (which I wasn't expecting). The pasta was really yummy and the kids devoured the pizza. The drinks left a little to be desired, but a few tweaks and they are good. I'm very disappointed they got rid of their tiramasu because that was the reason I selected to go to that restaurant. I waitress was ok, maybe new to the industry as she complimented every single one of our selections (which was kind of odd) and started handing us our bill before we were finished with our meal. It was ok, but I don't see myself rushing to go back."}
{"text":"This review is not for the food, it's for the service.  I have not had a chance to review until now.  It was about 2 months ago on a Friday evening.  It had been a long week and my daughter and I wanted to grab a bit to eat and then browse the Borders next door.  I knew there would probably be a wait since it was Friday night.  We walked in and there we some other parties seated waiting.  I went up to the hostess and gave her my name.  I asked where the restrooms were and told her we were going to use them and we would be right back.  She said \"that's fine\" .  There was another party of 3 ahead of us, a mom and two children, that had been seated there when we walked in.  They came in the restroom too and we all came back out at the same time and sat down to wait.  They were seated about 5 minutes afterward.  I watched the hostess as she folded napkins and did other things at her station.  Another couple walked in and they were seated immediatly.  Then another mom and child walked in and were seated.  When the hostess came back I told her we had been waiting ang gave her my name again....this was at least 15 mins later.......and she said \"I called your name\" very rudely.  I told her we had been in the restroom (for not more than 5 mins) and she said \"oh well\".  And then she said well, I guess I can seat you now.  This girl was maybe 18 or 19, tall, thin, pretty, but certainly did not have the brains god gave her!  She was rude and clearly did NOT pay attention to her job.  She was too busy trying to look pretty.    The rest of the experience was fine.  Our server was pleasant and fast. However, on the basis of that hostess.....stay away!  Management needs to keep a close eye on these kids.  They could take a lesson from the manager at Grimaldi's in Chandler.....that manager knows how to keep her staff in check and on the ball!  I won't be going back to this particular CPK."}
{"text":"Ordered on the App for pick up at 5:30. Apparently only the bar tender could ring me out. Not one of the 5 people that looked me dead in the eye watched as I waited. I was on a 30 minute lunch which is why I ordered for pick up at 5:30.  Paid extra to have broccoli & bell peppers added to my meal. Neither of which were present, no butter with the bread. And because of the amount of time I waited to rung up I didn't have time to turn around and go back to have them fix my order.   I called and let them know and she put me hold, I waited about 5 minutes before I had to go back to work and hung up."}
{"text":"Along with the standard CPK menu that I love, this place had the best staff I have ever encountered at a CPK. Well done!"}
{"text":"Why does this place still exist?  Back when Sizzler went out of business sometime in the mid-90's one marketing expert explained the reasons behind it like this: \"There was no longer any question people were asking to which the answer was 'Sizzler'\".  Soon after it lost relevance--and went through at least one bankruptcy-- the chain disappeared.  CPK is a nicely-decorated facility at a great location, but besides being the only pizzeria in the Biltmore Fashion Park proper, there is very little reason to visit here. It's not the answer to any current question.  The pizza is never better than so-so. The toppings are never really that fresh. The salads are an uninspired-though-nicely-arranged pile of iceberg and other ingredients that wouldn't seem extraordinary at Applebee's. In fact, i think Applebee's does salad better. The service tends to be a bit slow. The drinks are pricey.  For all this indifferent straight-from-Sysco quality, you pay a premium price.  It's probably been 10 years since this place has had any cachet that might justify the higher prices. Maybe longer. I think they might be hurting since the departure of Planet Hollywood, which itself brought a study stream of cornpone slackjaws impressed by a name--though not enough to keep it in business.  If you're looking for Pizza in this part of the Camelback Corridor, hold out and go to the Parlor at 19th St."}
{"text":"Rude server. Male servers are rude and that's all they usually have. I'm not returning to this location the Tempe location is the only pizza kitchen I'll go to for now on."}
{"text":"CPK, you are so 1998!   I stopped having pizza here about 15 years ago, but I do find myself partaking in some salad every now and again. I don't know if the times caught up to, and passed this restaurant chain, but it is good to redefine yourself every so often. I will say this location made huge strides changing the decor inside. Thai crunch chicken salad keeps me coming back. One of these days I need to do a nutrition check on that salad.......... Shit, just did a quick nutrition check in the middle of my review. Damn, 1400 calories! Well, I usually don't eat the whole thing or use the dressing, but wow, are there any greens in that salad? I'm sure I will still treat myself every now and then, maybe after half marathons!"}
{"text":"Always get the white corn dip and the chipotle chicken and Thai chicken half and half pizza!! Really nice place to come on a date and for family if you want a former type pizza, the ambience is welcoming as well as the waiters. The seasonal sangrias are delicious and would recommend the peach orchard sangria! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and I ordered a half Waldorf chicken salad and ended up waiting 30 minutes for it...And it's lunch time. I even called ahead of time but clearly that doesn't help here."}
{"text":"Has gone from very good to very bad. Recently learned they changed and did away with Chinese chicken salad. Ordered pizza instead; Got soggy tasteless crust. Think twice before ordering from them."}
{"text":"CPK. Creative. Pizzas. Kinda. When I think of the early 90s. I think of CPK. Of course I also think of Joey Lawrence on Blossom. But who doesn't, really? And new Coke. And we all know how that worked out. But CPK was innovative at the time. California cooking was all the rage thanks to Mr. Puck. The BBQ Chicken Pizza won over droves of pizza fans. Quickly, the Thai pizza caught on and CPK became quickly initialized in American culture like KFC, PTA and FYI. This location serves up the fare like all the others. Not much panache but dependable. Much like the Chevrolet Malibu. Could they use a bit of a makeover? Sure. But the Price Is Right set got one and no one's loving that. So why bother."}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday night. No wait! This CPK's bread and butter is the business lunch crowd, making it a great alternative at other times.  A very friendly and engaging server (Allie, I think) made for a very pleasurable evening. Any CPK visit is usually a three star, review unworthy, event for me. The positive five star service this night, however, prompted this review. (3 + 5)/2 = 4 stars.  Warm bread with olive oil. Solid salads. Solid pizza. Great kid's meals. Have you ever seen the kid's brownie ($1.29) or the kid's sundae ($0.99)? I posted a photo of each just in case you have not. Adult presentation at a kiddie price. You may just have to convince junior to share it with you."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm reviewing another chain.  But with two kids in tow who argue over almost everything, this was the easiest choice.  I sat in the back, by the restrooms because they need to go 6 times every meal.  Our server, Billy, was attentive and totally on task, thank you!!!  The kids meals are good and affordable and the Field Green salad and asparagus soup were great."}
{"text":"I dont' think I've every had a bad experience at CPK.  My favorite is the Barbeque Chicken Salad.  There are alot of restaurants that try to duplicate this recipe but can never achieve it.   Along from that, the Margarita Pizza is also delicious.  There are too many to choose from!"}
{"text":"Completely mediocre and boring actually.  Nothing great, Nothing bad-- just CPK.  It's there if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Great! My wife and I went here tonight , and brought our 7 month old. We waited for a table so that we could have a highchair with us, and the two hostesses and the manager were really attentive and helpful. Ordering food is always tough for us because of food allergies our nursing daughter has, so my wife can't eat a lot of stuff. Our server and the manager were amazing! The manager brought us a menu that shows every single ingredient in ever dish. So cool!  By far some of the best service we've ever had."}
{"text":"Overview: I recommend it.   Food: I ordered the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with shrimp (+$5) and The Works Pizza. The pasta is absolutely delicious. I would definitely come back here just for the pasta. I added chili flakes to my pasta since I like to eat thing spicy (not shown in my pics). As for the pizza, it was good too. But it's just the typical pizza. However, the pizza did came out a little but salty. I would still give it a 5 stars  Customer service: customer service was average. We did waited for our check a bit longer than normal about 20 minutes after we were done eating. Even though it wasn't even busy at all. Nothing over the top or anything. Just regular service.   Other notes: When I got to the place and looked at other people's review, it did kind of made me feel like I need to check what's in my food. Some helpers have posted pics with bugs in their food. To be honest, sometimes things do fly into our food from the kitchen to the dining area. If a simple costumer service can take care of that then it shouldn't be an issue or have the service fix the issue. I know some places either just remake the food freshly or offer the meal for free to the customer. As long it is taken care of n to satisfy the customer, then I think it's appropriate. But definitely should check the food for anything odd lol."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch with my colleagues.  We were sat quickly, and got our drinks promptly. Then we waited, and waited and waited for a server. I eventually gave up and went and found someone myself.   The food took forever (we were a group of 7) and the restaurant was almost empty by that time... The food was good, they charge for all refills without telling you they will charge you. That is a pet peve of mine."}
{"text":"First time here and its so delicious! The GM brought out bianco flat and it was great.  The staff is friendly and attentive!   Thank you CPK!!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been for awhile & was lured back for a promo. Looks like they spent some $ remodeling & the food was good but not like cpk of old & they are still trying to do way too much..."}
{"text":"The sashito peppers were delicious! The avocado chicken eggrolls delicious, crispy, just right. The two in one soup with farmers and potato was great."}
{"text":"I love this CPK!  it really is the best of all the locations.  Michelle has waited on me the last two times and always delivers warm and friendly service.  In fact, everyone is so nice here.  A sign of great Mgt.  I pop in here often when I am shopping and sit at the bar. Love there Moroccan and BBQ chicken salads.  The super thin crust marguerita pizza is excellent as well. Service is quick, food is good, what more can you ask for?    P.S.  Try the Sangrias too! Super fresh!"}
{"text":"Five star service from the people at CPK. The hostess, waiter, and manager were very pleasant people. I feel bad because I can't recall their names since its been about 1 month since we visited. It was my boyfriends first time there and the manager came over and offered us a free appetizer since it was his first time. How nice is that? Excellent service and food here. Next time I go I'll get their names and mention them on here. I love this place! I had the kung pao noodles with chicken and it was delicious. My boyfriend ordered a flat bread with crab and he loved it. We will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"How could you do away with your Szechuan Slaw CPK? There are some things in life that you just don't mess with. That is just wrong. All the food we ordered tonight was average. Not great not bad. We got the Arugula Salad from the side plate's special menu and the 4 cheese Ravioli entree to share. Everything was okay. We also got this Corn, Guacamale Dip with chips that actually was pretty good. Nothing to write home about in the great dept but nothing to complain about either. Welllllllll,  except that they did away with the Szechuan Slaw. Did I mention they did away with their Szechuan Slaw? Sigh, oh well. I wont be back. I only go there to get me some of that."}
{"text":"Food was yummy. Waldorf chicken salad and California club pizza. Service was awesome. Natasha was an amazing waitress:) give her a raise!"}
{"text":"Over the decades, CPK has \"progressed\" from unique hotspots where adults enjoyed exotic fare, to a depressingly familiar family chain, overrun with strollers and a high schoolish sense of service.   Times change. Competitors emerge. I remember being in Vegas in the late 80's, at Caesar's or Mirage - I forget.  CPK had a sleek space inside the casino, and I had a tandoori chicken pie with mango chutney, and almost cried at how good and unusual it was at the time.    Today you can go down the street and get flashier pizza, waitstaff and vibe at The Parlor - for comparable dough.     The other problem at the Biltmore location, as everyone and their aunt has mentioned, is the service. The kids are pleasant but dont seem to understand (or care) that we can see most of their crudities thx to the open floor plan. On a recent visit, I witnessed a server eat, another drink, another chew gum, and three more go to their mouth inappropriately.  This crew touches itself more than Lady Gaga.   It's pizza time!!!  The hombres by the ovens do a good job, executing recipes from the 90210 home office. Ingredients arent always first rate, but they work hard crafting what they have. The food and presentation is still the best thing about CPK.   Now if they could just dispatch that coughing brat from my eardrum, and get staff to try that newfangled hand sanitizer..."}
