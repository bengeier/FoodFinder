{"text":"Wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. Split a special and got an extra soup and egg roll. Waitress Shelly did a good job and the food was excellent and well presented. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We've been going to Mandarin House for many years and used to enjoy it. Although the fried rice is quite bland, the general tso's chicken used to be very good. I'm not sure what happened but the last 4 times I've ordered it, it's been horrible. It used to be actual chicken but it is now some type of rubbery grey \"meat\" that is not edible. Very disappointing because it was favorite"}
{"text":"Literally the absolute worst place I have ever went out to eat. I went there this Saturday with a group of people thinking -oh this will be a nice option... It took 15 minutes alone just to get our water which we asked for right away. There was a fly in our water. My husband was given the wrong meal and lied about saying it was the right meal... It was not. Everything took forever. Only one free refill on pop- which was flat and a Pepsi product. The silverware and plates were clearly dirty. There is just something not right about this place. It also smelled like a bowling alley ... Like someone had been smoking in the building right before they opened. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I like Mandarin House. I live far away and have been coming here with my niece and nephew when I am in town since they were kids (they are now in college), so it is a special place for us.  I would not call the place terrific or amazing, but i would say it is decent \"American-style Chinese restaurant\" The decor is a bit odd; no real identity, rather a collection of Asian stereotypes. However, if the owner is in-house, the music is good classic Jazz! Does not help the identity crisis, but does make for a good listen.  The food is consistently good. Again, not great. Not amazing. But dependable. And the young woman who often works at lunch-time is really helpful."}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice in 6 months - the first time the food was passable (2 Stars).  But my most recent visit will be the last.  My companion had sweet and sour shrimp that was clearly not freshly made, the shrimp was soggy and obviously microwaved.  But it was somewhat edible.  On the other hand, my General Tso's Chicken was served completely cold.  I did taste it and instantly regretted it. It was revolting.  Not sure it was even chicken.  The server was pleasant and removed it from the table and from the bill.  I think she gets a lot of that...."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on a Sunday apparently right after they had opened. 2 tables were seated before us and 3 tables after us.  We ordered 1 appetizer, and surprisingly our food took veryyyyyy long to come out. Actually the 3 tables that got seated after us got their food way before we did.  I was about to say something to the waitress and it finally made it out.  We didn't order anything complicated either. But the food was good.  I just wish when mix ups like this happen, the establishment would try to make things right instead of acting like they did nothing wrong. Waiting almost an hour for 3 chicken dishes was absurd.  I will give them another try.... One day in the future."}
{"text":"horrible food. takeout \"bourbon chicken\" was fatty, bland chunks of chicken served on a soggy bed of lettuce. lettuce was covered in sauce? WTF is that? honestly, very disappointed.  one would think ordering takeout from a sit down restaurant would improve the food quality. not the case here. fried rice tasted just like white rice. ordered two meals and only received one fortune cookie, that was the last straw.  dont go here."}
{"text":"My family has loved Mandarin House for years (my parents used to go often until recently). I'm unsure what has changed over the last 6 months to a year but the quality has gone way down. We have eaten take out a couple of times in the last couple of months. In November we ordered take out for 4 and 3 of the four meals were horrible tasting. My mom and I actually threw ours out. We gave it one more try tonight and though some of it was edible..is edible enough? The person who picked up the food today tried to explain the quality issue and it seemed as though there was little concern/customer service though a very small discount was given...more of a slap in the face than anything else. Sadly, we will have to find another Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years.  I either eat the sesame chicken or red curry chicken and the food is great!  Good service and good prices."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. Haven't been here in a while so thought I'd give it a second chance. Big mistake.    The last time I went was about a year ago and for lunch I got the sweet and sour chicken and fried rice and wonton soup and egg roll. They add unnecessary \"fillers\" to the plate like tomatoes and green peppers in the sweet and sour chicken. That time everything was ice cold and the rice tasted like coffee grounds.  Tonight I tried something different for dinner hoping it was going to be better. A family member got duck and it was dry and crunchy. My meal was chicken brocolli, rice, egg roll and wonton soup. The only thing this restaurant can serve well is their daily specials and the wonton soup and egg rolls.   Stay away from everything else.   Tonight my chicken broccoli had a weird brown sauce. It's supposed to only have chicken and brocolli no sauce. The added filler vegetables were stringy zucchini type strands of something and water chestnuts.  The entire dish reeked of urine. Again this dish should not have a gravy like sauce on it. It's supposed to be served dry. The egg roll, rice and wonton soup was fine. Water had white floaters in it.   The wait staff was rude. Did not refill drinks. The manager only made rounds with two tables. Did not even greet us. Or ask us how our meal was. And waitress only asked two members of our party(out of 4) if they wanted dessert. I will never go back. And I hope they get inspected and shut down.   They are lucky they get one star"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since my parents brought me as a baby.  Best Crab Rangoon I've had - more real crab meat than any other place I've tried. All the food is similar to what you'll get at other Chinese/Asian places but the quality is a big step up from those other places."}
{"text":"Went here a few times once a nice sitdown with some relatives got hair in my uncles dish. They took his main dish of the bill and still charged him for the egg roll and won tom soup We'll after that just me and my wife went  Because they do have some good  war su gai  and then I got hair in my dish as well  Then they said they would give me half off My main dish  Ok if you get hair in someone's food that's just nasty!  The whole meal should be free ! And a gift card to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  It's almost a disgrace to call this place a chinese restaurant.  I dont think there was even one chinese or remotely asian person working here.   The food is terrible and the portions are small.  The service is slow.  The inside decorations are terrible as they have japanese art work.  Might as well go to the mall food court for your chinese food."}
{"text":"I have tried many Chinese restaurants around me and I keep coming back to this one simply because the food is superb! The Spring Rolls are fantastic, rice, soups, sides and main dishes are just top-notch.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves good Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"I have been patronizing the Mandarin House for years and I thought I'd update my review based on my recent experience here.  The interior has been remodeled.  Yes, the wall fountain remains and the pool greets you as you enter the front door.  There are black-lacquered tables and bamboo shelves with pops of swirled aluminum accents.  The booths have pumpkin and beige colored block suede backs that reflect the glow of the sunset-colored windows.  The pendant lights are a modern version of Asian paper lamps that give the dining area an upscale feel.  The food here is amazing!  The chef will prepare your meal to the perfect spiciness upon your request.  I especially like the Moo Shu Pork with Duck Sauce (tender, chewy pancakes are the bomb) and the Kung Poa Shrimp (extra spicy with peanuts).  The appetizers are so good we sometimes don't order dinner!  Crab Rangoon, Spring Rolls, Egg Rolls, Crispy Won Tons.  I love drinking Sake and Plum Wine here, though there isn't a separate bar - sadly it seems that the restaurant space is too small to accommodate a bar.  The service is excellent and the staff makes one feel at home.  There is a beautiful water feature located outside of the entrance to the restaurant which adds to the allure."}
{"text":"Very dim inside... but takeout didn't improve the food any.  Potstickers were definately made in house... tasty rectangles of pork filling with very little vegetable.  The sauce seemed to be made with a well fermented soy or maybe a touch of fish sauce... not the traditional Sesame oil and a couple of floating green onions.  The white rice was short grain and sticky... but the fried rice was long grain and very dry and tasteless... it looked brown... but there was no Soy to detected.  The General Tso's chicken (hubby's bell weather for edible chinese) was served with green pepper and onion chunks... it was a glorified sweet and sour treatment (heavy on the breading, light on the tasteless sauce) that lacked even a hint of garlic.  While this is less than 2 miles from our new house... we will keep searching for takeout and dreaming of Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Pretty dissappointing! Would not substitute anything, no rice for noodles... etc. Server got very confused over the combo and ended up not even bringing my rice and eggroll...  wasnt even worth it to bring it up and try to explain... they didn't have vegetable eggrolls?only pork. All food was not hot...the crab Rangoon just had a cold block of cream cheese in side. All meals were room temperature upon arriving. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Just went in & walked out. Our water glasses were covered in lip stick and they weren't in any hurry to wait on us. I really was disappointed becuase I used to love their food.  The hostess seemed rude to me, too."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a kid. The pecan steak is my favorite, followed by the shrimp fried rice, and their crab Rangoon is different from any other that I've had, but still delicious. My mom gets some kind of fried shrimp appetizer that's really good. Everything we get is always delicious."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area. Very friendly and comfortable atmosphere. Great place for date night with a delicious, authentic meal."}
{"text":"The decorations and ambience of the restaurant was nice and so was the food. First time eating here and it was very quiet :)"}
{"text":"Didn't provide food as ordered for pick-up and what was included was not very good.  I tried calling back to complain but they conveniently failed to answer the phone!  Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Terrible. Absolutely terrible.  General's chicken tasted like it had ketchup as a sauce, shrimp lo mein tasted like watery soup, the fried rice was dry and inedible.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"The ambiance gets an A plus. There are holiday lights outside, a rock garden with a waterfall inside and perfectly selected music playing softly inside. This is a great start and a romantic atmosphere. I ordered Moo Shu Vegetables.  The meal came with white rice and a generous potion of fresh vegetables perfectly cooked, including broccoli and carrots. The plum sauce was a little shy, but acceptable. The service was excellent. The Server was dressed up, polite and checked back on the table several times. Looking forward to going back to order more Vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner and we both enjoyed our entrees, mine was orange beef and hers was pepper steak.   The orange steak oddly had no discernible heat, and I was brought some hot oil by the waitress hence I discovered the source of their legendary heat, they must make their own oil as this stuff was the hottest stuff I've ever been served, hotter than Scotch bonnets or any of their cousins. Their fried rice might just as well be white for all the flavor it imparted, it also lacked any of the niceties one finds in it from other sources like the  roast pork chunks or peas or carrots or onions or soy sauce.  Standard egg rolls. Service was good"}
{"text":"If you're taste buds are screaming for something better than the over populated awful/cheap Chinese restaurants than this place offers a delicious solution! Our service was fast as well as the food. You could tell that the soup & appetizers were made fresh and my waitress, Danielle was incredibly nice. Some of the best customer service I've had in a long time!   I really enjoyed their pot stickers, unlike most Chinese eateries, Mandarin combines a mixture of pork & chicken in a crispy/flaky shell. The sauce was a nice surprise as well, since it was (again) not the usual from most places but a bit spicier. I'll admit, their won ton soup was a little bland when it came to the broth but far from being awful. My fiancee ordered the lychee & duck platter & instantly fell in love :)   Can't wait to go back to this cute little place again!"}
