{"text":"I usually order through postmates but I decided to save myself the delivery fee and get this delicious iced caramel macchiato to enjoy with my Belgian waffle breakfast sandwich. Very cute and cozy little place. To the owner and barista, you're both warm and welcoming, thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The workers were attentive and helpful in describing menu items. The shop was reasonably priced in all their items. The atmosphere was homely and I felt like I was with family. The music playing was soft and peaceful. It made my experience at this shop better then what you would get at most shops. The people were cheerful and full of life that it made me want to come back. The food was just so amazing. Every taste had me coming back for more. Whether it be the pretzel, the espresso cake, or the loaded waffles. The coffee was to die for and didn't have the sour/burnt taste I usually have in the back of my mouth after drinking Starbucks. They had a wide plethora of items to choose from and anything you eat will have you coming back for more."}
{"text":"I love this little bakery in Tempe!  Fantastic breakfast menu and I can't wait to go back for lunch!  
I love their savory pastries!  Also their chocolate espresso cake is unbelievably fantastic...with a cup of coffee...heavenly!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little bakery with creative pastries, breakfast and lunch sandwiches, and salads. DELICIOUS soft pretzels! Try a big-ass blueberry muffin, a waffle breakfast sandwich with candied bacon, or one of their breakfast galettes! Inventive beverages, great service, and a nice atmosphere make this a great place to swing by or hang out."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim for breakfast and ordered the waffle with cream. The vanilla bean whipped cream is to die for, not overly sweet, just enough. The cream and waffle hold their textures throughout the meal, waffle still crispy and fluffy while the cream remained whipped and not melted. Orignally I felt the price was steep, but the quality was well worth it and I quickly ate my words with no complaints. Staff was very friendly and I plan to come back again."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe and AWESOME food! Very friendly staff, just needs a public bathroom otherwise very good :)"}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California visiting my sister and for breakfast we came to Sweetest Season. I had the classic with pretzel bread and all I could say was \"Awesome\". Everything was freshly baked and cooked and all so good. After tried the waffle sliders with bacon, ham and just plain cheese and those didn't disappoint. I left there with chocolate cookies, fresh pretzels, cream puffs, and an awesome bread pudding. Awesome owners, they know how to fill my tummy. I will be ordering more pretzels to be sent to me. Thank you for making Day!"}
{"text":"Cutest bakery around Tempe area. Food was awesome. We had the loaded waffles and bacon&blue galette. Warm atmosphere. A few tables inside and out. Chess board to play while you drink coffee or eat. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Loved finding this place. Their Arnold Palmers are AMAZING as well as their baked goods. Stop by and give this Sweet bakery a try."}
{"text":"We love this place...but we Really love Melody! So glad she made the choice to follow her dream. And that her dream landed Sweetest Season Bakery & Café in walking distance to our new home. Actually, that might be a bit of a problem for us! The pastries here are, well, EXCELLENT. Flakey crusts, delicious ingredient combinations. So many wonderful tastes. 
The Turtle Tarts are a Must Try. And the Cinnamon Swirl. Oh, and the Apple Strudel. Oh don't forget the Breakfast Galettes!
We have not been disappointed. Come on by - say hi to our new friend Melody!"}
{"text":"Very adorable location, staff is nice and food is amazing. Have been here a few times and it is always delicious. The lemon cupcake?is he best. The staff was very patient and nice to an intense customer while I was waiting everything was quick and awesome."}
{"text":"Really want to go in and try this place in person after ordering their goodies from Postmates. I never even would have known this adorable little spot is tucked away where it is otherwise!

We tried an Iced Caramel Macchiatto and a Lemonade. I'm a caffeine addict but I was jealous of my boyfriend's lemonade; it was so refreshing! The coffee was divine as well. 

As for the food... oh man. I don't even like sweet stuff that much but I could not stop eating the Loaded Belgian Waffles. The reason I want to go in person is so they can make my plate look all pretty and deliver it the way it's supposed to be... The self-assembled ugly takeout dish I made was so good I can only imagine it's even more amazing fresh & in-person. 

Also tried The Classic breakfast sandwich and was not disappointed. The bacon was excellent, although a bit cold by the time I got around to eating it. I guess I would compare it to a McGriddle, which I've always thought was weird and gross (I don't do sweets so much lol). It pretty much has those same flavor profiles but less processed and made me want to keep taking bites."}
{"text":"Love love love their pastries. Everything we have bought so far from here has. Even delicious. From huge chocolate covered strawberries to the most delicate cheese danish I've ever had. Oh and a yummy salty focaccia bread. Location is great and shop is cute. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I order the loaded frequently through Ubereats. I work odd hours and dont get time to visit your restaurant. I work Saturdays and Sunday's your closed :( thank you so much for bringing the worlds best waffle sandwich into my life!! I do tell all my friends about you, i wish you were open on sundays ( thank you for the raspberry loaf for my sunday breakfast treat) :) 

I love the loaded waffle, it brings much joy to my cheat days :)"}
{"text":"Low carb mashup breakfast sandwich is not even remotely low carb, a completely waste of money for a diabetic like myself. The bacon was candied with either maple syrup or sugar and eggs were more of a soufflé than anything. When writing up menus please consider that guests with allergies or dietary restrictions look for things they can order. I posted a photo of how the menu describes their \"low carb\" sandwich. No mention of sugared maple bacon."}
{"text":"Melody is a genius when it comes to baking! Everything I have tried from her bakery is to die for. Especially her lemon pound cake. Her sandwiches are also amazing. She makes the bread herself and it is so fluffy and moist. I also love that you can order them for your parties. You can smell her bakery from a mile away! Everything is so delicious. It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"Out of this world cookies. We get them for our clients from. They love them and I always get some extras for myself! I haven't had anything that wasn't delicious."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to Tempe for a family visit.  This was one of the best parts of our trip!  We went every day.  Nice people, Unpretentious.  Good baked egg with cheese.  Great coffee.  Many bakeries have only sweet baked goods.  Here, they have savory things, too."}
{"text":"Not only are the desserts sweet but so are the wonderful owners who hand craft most items on the menu, from pastries all the way down to the syrups they create for the coffee beverages. Highly recommend. Inviting/ homey atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"They just upped the prices on the loaded waffles from I believe $7 to $9.50. Disappointed in the price jump I liked that it was a fast place to get a good waffle but at that price I might as well save my self for a sit down restaurant.  It was good but sorry to say I won't be visiting any longer..."}
{"text":"Tried the galette and it was delicious. Ended up getting two pretzels and they were yum, specially with the mustard sauce these guys make - reminded me of pretzels in Bavaria."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for breakfast today and I ordered the Classic on a Waffle. A great blend of baked egg, candied bacon and cheddar cheese, with a side of maple syrup. My wife, not one to eat breakfast before 11:00, elected to have a cappuccino and a palomar and loved both. Well, We enjoyed today's breakfast so much, we went back again with our granddaughter to order lunch. My wife and granddaughter both ordered pastrami and cheese, with spicy mustard on focaccia and I ordered the Chick(en) and cheese sandwich and all 3 of us were blown away with the exceptional tastes being offered up. I elected to top off my lunch with a generous slice of house baked Dutch apple pie, which was AMAZING as well. Pretty sure I won't need to eat the rest of the day, but expect I will anyway. 

You have to try this place. This isn't just another breakfast or lunch as usual kind of place. Select from a range of very creative and delicious menu items, no matter what you order. I'm sure you'll be impressed."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place. Amazing is an understatement. The food is really good, the pastries are even better, and the staff is incredibly nice and helpful.

The egg, cheese, and bacon sandwich with waffle bread is my favorite. I really like the cream puff and bread pudding too. Pretty sure I've tried everything and it is all good"}
{"text":"stopped by here one day just to check it out and the apache club changed my life! brought my mom here last week and she loved it too. fantastic customer service and cute place just to hang out."}
{"text":"Melody has catered several meals for our agency, Association for Supportive Child Care.  Not only is the food she creates so yummy but the presentations have been beautiful!  Flat breads are to die for :-)  

We went to the restaurant today and Melody created three different flat breads...all so yummy! These need to be on the menu so others can enjoy them!!!"}
{"text":"If you want heaven on earth then this is where you need to be. Everything is made from scratch including the caramel sauce for your coffee. Waffles are so light and crunchy, Yum! Then the berries, whip cream.. do I need to go on? The husband and wife team are down to earth and you feel like a welcomed guest in their home. There are tables for checkers and on Saturday's they do a tea service which is my next visit. This is a hidden Gem!"}
{"text":"I don't usually do Yelp reviews, but this place is worthy of a great review! Fantastic! From the iced coffee to the breakfast sandwich to the blueberry muffin to the low carb mash up...Amazing! Service is great! Atmosphere is comfortable. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today to pick up some bakery items for one of my clients. The owners of the bakery are very accommodating and very friendly.  The cinnamon roll I had was fantastic I will be back. Our little bakery gem in Tempe"}
{"text":"The bakery is so delicious and I can tell that they use good quality ingredients. I had pound cake with raspberry on top, and half double chocolate & chocolate chip cookie. I like that I can taste butter in the cake and the cookie is not too sweet.

I love the cafe atmosphere is so lovely. I would like to visit again and enjoy the tea and pastry there.

I also love the packaging. The boxes and the unique brown bag are so lovely."}
{"text":"After a mediocre meal we were craving something sweet.  We stumbled on about the only bakery open on a Sunday that had good reviews - the Sweetest Season.  Cute little space next to one of our favorite Indian restaurants. The sugar plum fairy blessed this baker with a gift for sure!  I ordered a s'moresy bar that had dark chocolate, graham crust, and a meringue topping.  I took a bite out of our to go box of goodies while in the shop and had to purchase another.  Just a bit of background to this confession, I do not usually eat two of any dessert, although addicted to sugar I am able to minimize damage to my heart health and waistline on most occasions.  Not this time baby, two were still not enough!!!  The crust was just right, moist while not being overly buttery, the dark chocolate cut the sweetness just a tad where mild chocolate in traditional amores treats can be overpowering, and the little star shaped puffs of meringue were melt in your mouth delicious.  We took home a chocolate chip cookie, a chocolate eclair and the s'mores bars, all were enjoyed with mmm's and omg so good noises.  The four star rating is due to the coffee which was a bit disappointing.  I ordered a dirty chai which I believe I am a credible critic of and was underwhelmed by the expresso, the chai and the whole presentation.  I might need to try another coffee drink to be totally fair.
Definitely will be back, kinda wish it were closer to home, kinda don't cause I would have to buy bigger pants."}
{"text":"I've only been once and had a delicious little tart! The crust tasted like it'd been frozen, which is a pet-peeve for me, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Service was also very personable. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The sweetest season is any season involving buttery flaky pastries! This small shop opened up recently in India Plaza and sells sandwiches, pastries and coffee. The interior is cozy and casual with several tables and chairs.

After browsing through the menu I decided on the egg, spinach mushroom and cheese galette with an iced latte with almond milk. I also got a soft pretzel to go. The galette needed to be heated up for 15 minutes so I took a seat to settle in for lunch.

The galette had a buttery flaky dough with soft fluffy eggs inside. It needed a touch more seasoning and I would have liked some more mushroom and spinach in the galette. The pastry itself was overcooked a bit as the top was very dark brown and slightly burnt tasting.

I wasn't a fan of the iced latte. It tasted more like iced regular coffee instead of espresso with milk.

I took the pretzel home and had some of it as a snack later. It was super soft on the inside with a slightly crisp outer crust. It came with a side of mustard that complimented it well.

Since I'm in this area a lot I might stop by here for pastries but I'll avoid the coffee next time."}
{"text":"Awesome pastries the best in the East Valley. Try there muffins each and every flavor is to die for."}
{"text":"The ham and cheese pastry was just OK in my book, but the dough it was made with was excellent! The cakes are really good--I will definitely return to purchase some sweets."}
{"text":"Really yummy iced coffee!! Always made in a quick timely matter! Owner is a sweetheart as well!"}
{"text":"Yes--the sandwich was yummy for my tummy!! I ordered the shredded chicken sandwich with sweetest season chips and iced chai latte for lunch. It was all most . I had this delivered to my house cause I worked from home and this was the best lunch ever."}
{"text":"Great place!! If you come to Tempe, this place is a must stop. Highest quality from pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and even compostable plates. Todd is friendly and a all around great host."}
{"text":"NOT TO BE MISSED!! If you are a Tempe local and Sweetest Season is your neighborhood bakery, I envy you! Treat yourself to delicious baked goods made from scratch that will simply blow away any expectations, period.

Their Lemon Soaked Pound Cake is \"to-die-for\", we savored every bit, and the Streets of Philly sandwich has amazing flavor and certainly doesn't leave you hungry. Their place is very cozy and welcoming so it's nice to hang out and enjoy a cappuccino or latte at your leisure.

When you go you'll probably met Melody & Todd, the proprietors and a truly talented couple. You can tell they take pride in their food and baked goods because the end result tastes and looks amazing! We can't wait to visit again but in the meantime thank goodness they ship!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They're more than often consistent. Their chicken sandwich is amazing and so is the lemon cake. So so so good. You should go."}
{"text":"It smells like bacon waking in!!! Already in love and haven't even tried this place yet... Great energies in the atmosphere. Pastries look delish. . . upbeat tunes in the background. Trendy decor. Drink prices are inexpensive. Decent food pricing"}
