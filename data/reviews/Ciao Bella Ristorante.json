{"text":"This was a real find!  Quaint understated restaurant with excellent food!  They use the prix fixe type of menu and we all had an unbelievably yummy veal chop with various appetizers.  Caesar salad very authentic and I had portobello with goat cheese that was awesome too!.  Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The Event: Casual Friday night dinner with a group of 6

The Good: Taste of food, Atmosphere, Portion sizes

The Bad: Rushed service, location

Highlights: Owner seemed a little into himself.  We had to change the time of our reservation to 30 min later and we called to make and confirm the change.  We were accommodated, but when we arrived, the owner was moody saying his restaurant gets busy and we won't have as much time for dinner now...which makes no sense."}
{"text":"We arrived a group of 6 for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant was almost full. There were a few large groups seated and eating. There was only one waiter on the floor that night.  After being served some drinks we ordered our appetizers and main courses. We waited 1.5 hours for our salads. When we asked why there was such a  delay  to get our salads the waiter admitted that he had forgotten to hand in our orders.  We finally got our orders.The food was good but there was no apologies for such lousy service. By the time we were served our main courses we had been in the restaurant for 2 hours. They never offered us a complimentary coffee or anything not even an apology. We will not be returning there."}
{"text":"Spring Hills Suites in Vaughan, ON recommend Ciao Bella otherwise we would have never found the place. From the outside, doesn't look like much in an industrial area. Inside is painted tastefully to look like a street scene in Italy to include real windows and shutters. 

Three of us ate there. Each of us had one of the prix fixe meals ($25,30,and 35 combinations). Everything was outstanding from the house wine to the creative appetizers, freshly made focaccia, main courses and desserts. Calamari was not fried but instead very tender. Eggplant stuffed with goat cheese and grill peppers was fantastic. Business friends both had veal that they enjoyed. I had seafood linguine which was loaded with seafood and very flavorful.
