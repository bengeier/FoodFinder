{"text":"Went there after wanting to go for months and must have picked a bad day. I started with the chicken satay appetizer and two soups. Both soups were Tom Yum (one with chicken and the other with shrimp), the soup was good but not as good as Otani in Hudson. For my main dish I went with the drunken noodles with for two chili hot on the menu was very disappointing. Nothing irritates me more than thinking I'm getting a really spicy meal and there is nothing to it. I'll give it another try and hope it's better so I can change my review."}
{"text":"I got the Torn Yum Soup with chicken, that's in-fucking-credible, and I got the Drunken Noodles with chicken that were fucking lights out! The chow is awesome! Excellent! My buddy got the Crab Rangoon and informed me they were also \"f****** amazing.\" Get down on some Tai people!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit but it sure won't be my last! The service was stellar ... thank you Frances! The food was amazing. We had summer rolls & spring rolls for an appetizer. I had the drunken noodles with chicken and my brother had the green curry.  The food was not only delicious but beautifully presented. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and it was the best Thai food that I've had in awhile. The Pad Thai was delicious and the portion size was huge. The Spicy Basil Fried Rice was extremely good and it was definitely spicy and the position size was huge as well. I think I found my new go too place when I'm craving Thai food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Frances, our waitress, was wonderful.  She was quick and responsive, and never sat idle.  The food was fresh and came out in a reasonable amount of time.  We had a great experience and will definitely return.  If you're looking for an Asian restaurant that is quaint and of high quality, this place is reliable."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"volcano\". Very tasty, not too spicy.  Atmosphere pleasant, service good.  I would return."}
{"text":"Nice decor and atmosphere. Very clean. Outdoor seating available. I have been here several times and the food is consistently delicious. Service is great. Tables aren't too close together. Drinks are good. Overall, a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The Yellow Chicken Curry is awesome. Better than Cilantro in downtown Akron. The Chicken Fried Rice was also great."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Lemongrass yesterday. I gave them 3 stars. First off the atmosphere was decent. Restaurant is new so everything is clean. We got seated right away. They didn't take our order for 20 min. We ordered shrimp and beef pad Thai, shrimps on blankets and 2 pho. The pad Thai and shrimp in blankets was tasty but I don't recommend getting the pho. The flavor is there but the smell of the pho threw me off. Pho comes with a dish of veggies. The veggies came in a very small amount. The bean spout was brown and looked old. While eating I felt really uncomfortable, the staff kelp watching us eat. Overall I'll say the place is ok. I'll try it once but probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Good food and large portion sizes.  The staff was friendly and there was a good atmosphere.   I recommmend the shrimp pad thai."}
{"text":"Best Thai place I've ever been to. Excellent service, excellent food. Restaurant is very clean, and the manager (maybe owner, not sure) is always there and is very welcoming. The green curry is SO good! Every friend I've introduced to this place loves it, and returns often.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The best staff and the best food in the area for any Thai Try to get her at least once or twice a week"}
{"text":"Ordered the appetizer sampler. it was OK. Then ordered Pad thai which has no spice to it and was too sweet. Was sweet than General tso's....which not normal for Pad thai"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. The curry's are great so is the chicken satay. Worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Lemongrass grill had the best thai food I have ever tasted. The waitress that served me was very nice."}
{"text":"I've read the rave reviews and can only assume that folks in NE Ohio have had limited or little exposure to Thai food.  The staff is super friendly and the bar is really good.  On three visits, I've found that the food is pretty bland.  The Crab Rangoon is spiced with cinnamon and taste too sweet.  The Pad Thai is not spicy.  But it's a nice place.  And the bar is good."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in the area. Yellow curry chicken is creamy and drunken noodles are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I know this restaurant is new, but they definitely need to work on some issues. The food is not very good, and the service was not either. We ordered an appetizer, salad, and entrees. The entrees came out 45 minutes after we order but no appetizer and salad.  We told the waitress to cancel the appetizer and salad. She looked confused, and said the chef almost had them ready. She also never came back, and we had to ask for drink refills. The entrees (red chicken  curry and pad thai) were not very good. Unless we hear it changes, we will not go back."}
{"text":"Great Thai menu with a lot of variety. Very nice interior, although not what you might expect for a Thai restaurant.  I gave it 4 stars because there are Thai restaurants I prefer, but you really cannot lose here, much better still than what passes as the best in many other cities. Akron is just so rich in Thai restaurants, it is difficult to stand out. Not a lot of parking. Nice place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Came here in the late afternoon, nice and quiet. Good for family. But almost too quiet, they should play music in the background. We got the fried dumplings and summer roll as an appetizer very delicious and came out super fast. For the entree we got the Pad Thai, the portion was huge! It tasted sweet and saucy, they way I like it! Service was very good. Inside was nicely set up and they have an outside patio to sit at. Overall, our experience was very good and would go back again if in that area."}
{"text":"Went to the Lemongrass Grill the other day for lunch, very nice place, going back sometime soon for dinner. I ordered the Pad Thai Shrimp from the smiling waitress who was very accommodating. The pad Thai was one of the best I ever had and reasonably priced. If your looking for Thai food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"The waiter was very nice. The food was fresh and came out very fast. The pho was very good along with the Pad Thai. I would defiantly come here again for a fresh meal."}
{"text":"First time here and not very impressed. Ordered drunken spicy noodles. Noodles were over cooked and not spicy at all. The overall taste was actually pretty bland. The search for good Thai food in this area continues ..."}
{"text":"Good was delicious! We ordered take out from here while visiting my family and I loved it! I tried the red curry and the green curry and both had different but flavorful tastes. The portions are pretty big too. I can't wait to have my leftovers for lunch! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Golden Dragon, so, same ownership - another great restaurant? Bingo. I went there with my parents for dinner a few weeks ago. It was decently crowded for a rainy Thursday. We started off with the fried thai dumplings, which were incredible. I ordered the Pho with the thinly sliced beef and Asian meatballs. The beef was a little well done - I think because the broth was so hot that it cooked it more than it needed to be done. The Asian meatball were perfection though - and I had enough leftover to take home for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I got the pad Thai. It was excellent. The atmosphere is clean and neat and the service is good. I was amazed at how huge my portion was. I don't ever have leftovers but I had an adequate meal to take home for the next days lunch. The pad Thai was seasoned perfectly, just the right combination of sweet and salty. The noodles were to die for. The person I went with got the drunken noodle, seemingly a guest favorite, I had debated ordering them until she did then opted to try hers. They were far spicier(as advertised) than I would have anticipated. If you like heat give it a shot. I wish I could have tried everything on the menu. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. Service was warm and friendly and the atmosphere was great. They also have a patio that would have been nice to sit at if it wasn't so late. Most importantly the food was fantastic! Especially the Panang Curry. Can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"Service was very good and the food was great.  I had the Pad Thai and loved it.  Recommend this place."}
{"text":"My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed a recent dinner at Lemongrass Grill.  Our server, Joe, was very attentive, positive energy filled and knowledgable about menu selections.   I had the Tom Kha (Chicken Coconut) Soup to begin my meal.  It was very good.  I was deciding between the Tropical Village Feast, The Bangkok Volcano and The Quaker Sizzling.  I decided on The Bangkok Volcano - it was a great recommendation from our server.   I also had Bubble Tea - my first time trying this unique & trendy beverage !  They offer pineapple, honeydew, mango and strawberry varieties - I had the pineapple - it was a pefect ending to the meal.  Their desserts sounded intriguing, but I opted to finish feeling comfortably full. We are looking forward to returning.  The view of the railroad tracks is pretty cool.   The location is quaint - it was previously a cupcake shop.   I am glad it is so close to my home - I could actually walk there !"}
{"text":"Really excellent. A lot of Variety, charismatic staff, and delicious food. All around great experience."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time Saturday loved everything we tried, cashew chicken, and shrimp pad Thai. Bubble tea was tasty and the dumplings as an appetizer were packed full of flavor. Loved that they also featured a bar menu. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Terrific find, off the beaten path.  Ming, the owner, immigrated to the US in 1980 from Cambodia.  He is a terrific gentlemen and host.  The service, atmosphere, and most importantly the cuisine, were all fantastic.  Love to see these great examples of immigrant success in America."}
{"text":"We will be back here really soon!  Our service was excellent and the food was awesome. The restaurant was clean and bright with a small bar.   We started with the blanket shrimp which were crunchy deliciousness. We both had the pho. The broth was fragrant and well seasoned. The noodles were a bit to toothier than I have had previously and I really like that. The condiments were a bit more scarce as I wish fried garlic was served with it. They do have chili oil upon request. We had fried bananas with coconut ice cream to finish."}
{"text":"No no no. This is not good Thai food. This is more like a Chinese/Thai type of a restaurant. I ordered three different things and they were all bland! I was very disappointed. The service was good though and the restaurant appeared to be clean. I thought the decor was fine. I even liked the polish cement floors. The bathroom could've used a good scrubbing though. Will I go back, no!"}
{"text":"Nothing special way too overpriced for the food I would just do takeout Chinese and throw some cilantro on it because that's the only differencs"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai in the Akron area. Clean restaurant with friendly staff!!! I got the shrimp rolls as my appetizer and was shocked to see the huge shrimp! Not like other local Thai restaurants who use the frozen Walmart shrimp."}
{"text":"A tad underwhelmed after the first visit.  Honestly, the best part of the meal was the house salad with vinegar base ginger dressing.  We had ordered the beef skewers as an app - found them to be well prepared but bland.  Tossed the meat into the salad.  The added bit of dressing really zinged the beef.  Entrees tried were the Bangkok volcano and pad thai.  Prep, presentation and portion were all great.  Flavors were a bit muted.  Service was good.  May try it again to sample the curry or Pho. Overall experience was a mutual \"just ok\"."}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I asked are there any specials? Meng, the owner told me about \"crying tiger\", something new that he will be adding to the menu. WOW! It was a explosion of many flavors in my mouth. It is super. The mussels appetizer is superb. You've got to try this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service! I got the fried rice with pineapple and my wife got the Pho. It was extremely delicious and made us feel we were experiencing it in Thailand!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Delicious Thai served with thoughtfulness and fun.  Lemongrass is a fun place to dine where they take Thai food seriously.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"First visit here today. For our appetizers, we order their Lemongrass Bundle. I had the Drunken Noodles with chicken & my sister had the Pho. The food were perfectly done. There weren't a lot of customers when we dine in so we don't have to wait a long time for our food to come out and the atmosphere were wonderful. Plus I'm so glad we have a very friendly waitress. Definitely will go back and try some other foods."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant! The food here is amazing, hot and inexpensive! Order a cocktail, they come in fun glasses.  The wait staff can sometimes neglect to check on you, but overall it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! And they even had sweet and sour chicken for my 8 year old nephew."}
{"text":"A group of about 35 ladies from church enjoyed a fantastic meal at this restaurant. The only negative is that there is only one handicapped spot in their parking lot, which was extremely difficult for me, as I recently had hip replacement surgery and walk with a cane. That being said, our dining experience was fantastic. They served crab rangoon *crab meat, cream cheese, & scallions wrapped in a pastry shell) and edamame (steamed soybean pods) and complementary appetizers to everyone. In the meantime, I also enjoyed a strawberry daiquiri ($6.95). My dinner selection was Chicken with Cashew Nuts (a combination chicken braised with sweet onion, zucchini, bell pepper, & bamboo shoots in brown sauce & sprinkled with roasted cashew nuts, along with a bowl of brown rice) for $11.95....so much food that I ended up taking half of it home."}
{"text":"Comfortable space and attentive wait staff. We only had appetizers, but they were all very good - tom yum soup, steamed thai dumplings, and satay beef skewers. The food came out quickly and was perfectly seasoned and prepared.   The only drawback was the temperature in the restaurant - the windows must be poorly sealed, because we were freezing throughout the meal. We felt a breeze on our face...and at the end of December, that isn't all that pleasant.   But, as everything else was wonderful, the draft won't keep me from going back. I just might wait until it's a little warmer outside."}
{"text":"Between the Pho and the dinner's I haven't had a bad dish. Generous portion with authentic flavors is a nice change from the crap I've had from trying other Thai restaurants. Also the crab Rangoon is made with a really light flaky dough, maybe filo, it's amazingly light but savory."}
{"text":"Lemongrass Grill is located in the quaint little town of Munroe Falls. The outside and inside of the restaurant are very clean and well kept. Nice decor and friendly staff. We ordered some hot tea and a couple appetizers (Blanket Shrimp and Steamed Dumplings) which were very tasty and clearly made by hand. My husband ordered the Chicken Pho and I went with the Duck Pho. They arrived in HUGE bowls with sides of sprouts, basil, lime wedges and jalapeno slices. Honestly, it was fantastic! I couldn't finish mine since the bowl was so large, but it tasted so good I didn't want to stop eating! We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and the service of our very nice and attentive waitress. We will definitely be back. 5 stars!   :)"}
{"text":"Great little place in Monroe Falls. Love all the Thai options and that you can pick how hot you want your meal. Service was fast and they have carry out menus too. Full service bar and lots of large tables for big parties. I got the garlic chicken and it was amazing and I can make it spicy if I want it too. Love this place and they have bubble tea and lots of TVs. $-$$"}
{"text":"I came for the Pho, and It wad delicious. Perfect for a fall night. The Pad Thai was good too. The sweet and sour chicken was just ok, according to my husband. We carried out. That pho tho!"}
{"text":"After not being able to get into our usual chain restaurants, we decided by to try something by new. So glad to we did . We had a fantastic dinner. The best spring rolls I have ever had. The Pad Thai was a very generous portion that was even better the next day. Our waitress was helpful and friendly. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Gnats.   Gnats everywhere.  Server didn't even seem to care. Food was mediocre at best.  Really had high hopes because of the menu, but no such luck.  Add a few fly strips and maybe I'll try again."}
{"text":"My husband is always reluctant to try new kinds of food so it took some talking to get him to agree to try this.  He kept telling me he'd probably have to go across the street to McDonald's.    We went early on a Saturday night and it was already crowded.  I had yellow curry and he had pork fried rice.  Both were very good.  The portions were large but he ate all of his and I had half of mine.  And, yes, he's more than willing to return."}
{"text":"They have the most amazing Duck pho in Akron! Defiantly a must try. Very well priced. Great customer service. A well hidden gem in Cuyahoga Falls!"}
{"text":"So so so good!!! The chicken pad Thai was a huge portion and one of the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable and comparable to other local Thai places, but the serving size here seems much more plentiful.   Everything we got tasted great and came out quickly. The waitress was prompt and extremely nice. The place was nice and clean. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Ate here and got TERRIBLE food poisoning. Food tastes okay, but definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Lemongrass grill is a hidden gem!! Not many people I speak to about this restaurant know it even exists because of its peculiar spot right next to the Munroe Falls railroad tracks, but those who do, always rave! The interior is cute, but the outdoor patio is really nice on a cool summer evening.   The best appetizer I have ever had at any restaurant can be found here; the beef skewers... They have an AMAZING lemon-y sauce on them and I crave them so often. This place has such interesting and yummy dishes! Only reason I am giving 4 stars is for a poor service experience here last visit, but overall, the food is spectacular at Lemongrass Grill!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times. It's a bit pricey compared to other Thai restaurants in the area, and the entrees are inconsistent in level of spicy. The pad thai is pretty good - very flavorful and the green curry is pretty good. My complaint is with the takeout service. I ordered sweet and sour shrimp for my kids tonight. I arrived home to find they had dumped the sauce over the entire order and it had already become soggy and gross in the 12 minute drive home. Normally you get the sauce on the side. I'm tossing it out and planning to go to another Thai place next time."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I once complained about their food being a tad sweet. Not as sweet as most Asian restaurants in this area, but sweet non the less. I ordered Drunken Stir Fry with chicken and brown rice; it was flavorful with crisp vegetables and just the right level of spiciness. So glad to have an Asian restaurant near me that doesn't specialize in overly sweet Americanized dishes. Love the owner!"}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Pho to go, I was afraid I would get less of a portion because it was a to go order but NO! It was so plentiful and good and fresh!! Also got the summer roll was delicious. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food w nice atmosphere. Chicken wing appetizers could win a wing contest. Excellently prepared food, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Amazing find!  I drove by & popped in for last minute take out. I enjoyed talking with the owner while I waited and he recommended some great lunch specials!  Food was fast, delicious and healthy. I'll definitely be coming back and trying a new dish every visit :)"}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere and staff all make for wonderful experience! Portion is more then worth the price and the flavor is out of this world! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"YES, just YES!!!! A nice, clean restaurant. We were greeted by Joe, who gave us the best service we've had in a long time! Joe was friendly, got our orders quickly & correctly, and has one hell of a handshake!! I ordered the Pad See Ew with Chicken & Beef and my husband ordered the Pad Thai with extra, extra shrimp. Our food was very hot when it arrived and may I add, piled onto our plates. There was enough food to feed about three other people. We were both very pleased with our dishes. Joe suggested hot chili oil to add to our dishes...that even kicked it up a notch! I was amazed how good my dish was the next day...dare I say, even better!!! Even if you've never had Thai food before, give it a try...I suggest the Pad See Ew!! Enjoy!! I know we can't wait to go back!! Hopefully Joe will be working too!!"}
{"text":"This place is a find!   We came by thinking to get some light appetizers and soups and were pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the restaurant looked to be. Big windows, clean, and a rather modern interior. We decided against takeout and managed to get seated right away despite the healthy Saturday night dinner crowd. Food-wise, we ordered the tom yum soup and the chicken pho - both were very good in terms of quality and authenticity of taste. The pho, in particular, was on point - and came with a good amount of chicken and fresh garnishings (sprouts, basil, lime wedge and sliced jalapeno) on the side.  Four stars for the  food + inviting ambiance. Adding a 5th star for the good service (not typical of Asian places) and not dumbing down the food for the midwestern palate."}
{"text":"This was a hidden gem,  The food was great and the service was fantastic!   The Panang was amazing, The pho was on point!  Everything about this place was pretty amazing. So happy to have found it"}
{"text":"**3rd dine-in visit**  These folks have really upped their game. Lemongrass Grill has ascended to being the best Thai place in the area.  My wife and I had the summer rolls, red curry chicken, and monsoon chicken.  Summer Rolls: Soft and fresh. Generous portions of shrimp and basil. The peanut - hoisin sauce was fantastic.  Red Curry Chicken: Evenly spiced, plenty of fresh green beans, red peppers, bamboo shoots, and zucchini - emphasis on the fresh. The chicken was good (If Lemongrass wants to be 6 stars, it could do something no other Thai place in the region does and grill it's meats before mixing them with the curries / sauces) and the thick curry sauce was the best I've had in ages. The chef used plenty of coconut milk and just the right amount of fish sauce and spices.  Monsoon Chicken: A Thai variant on sweet n sour, but sooo much better. Again, the vegetables were very fresh, the chicken good, and the sauce was light and tangy with just a touch of heat.  The service was excellent. Our server timed the arrival of apps and entrees perfectly.  Lemongrass Grill is emerging as a wonderful local story. When they first opened earlier in 2015, their service and food were somewhat uneven - sometimes great, sometimes meh. They have fixed their flaws and are now operating at a very high level. We'll be returning often!"}
{"text":"We regularly eat out for Thai food, and have tried every restaurant in the area. Our favorites up to this point have been Thai Gourmet and Cilantro Thai. Lemongrass Grill may now overtake one of those positions, at least with respect to the food.   SERVER:  Our waitress was prompt and courteous. She was quick to clear the table of empty plates. No complaints.  SETTING:  Less intimate that we would have liked. Sound reverberates in the big open space. They've tried hanging some sound dampening panels, but it's not enough. We were also irritated that they had football playing on big flat screens. If you're just out with friends or family, this would be alright. If you want a more intimate experience, Thai Gourmet would be better.   FOOD:  We ordered the summer rolls with peanut sauce, coconut chicken soup, Massaman Curry with Chicken, and the Old Siam curry dish. The summer rolls were fresh and very tasty. The coconut chicken soup was by far the BEST we've had anywhere. I don't know what they're doing differently, but it had a much richer flavor. For this reason alone we will be coming back. The Massaman Curry was great, however it did not have potatoes as expected (and stated on the menu). They had substituted carrots, which was a letdown, though they were still prepared well. The pineapple in the Old Siam dish overwhelmed the other flavors, but it was still good. In both dishes, the chicken was flavorful, and not overcooked.  SPICE:  If you like spicy food, you'll have to ask them to increase the heat. Both our curry dishes were labeled \"spicy\", but they really weren't. Even without that, though, the flavors were still excellent.  PORTIONS: The curry dish portions were at least as large as other restaurants, if not larger. The coconut chicken soup portion was a bit smaller than at other restaurants, though well worth it.  Overall we had a great experience, enjoyed every dish, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time visiting, brought my husband and brother. Pho was delicious just like I have had in Virginia. Summer rolls were good too. I think I got my brother hooked on the noodle soup since he had never had it before and already wants to go back."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered the summer/shrimp rolls with rice paper and rare beef pho to go. Both were really good and I will definitely try this place again. The atmosphere inside, while I wasn't in there long, seemed fun and cozy."}
{"text":"I just went to Lemongrass for the first time, and I was so pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere, the service, and the food (quality and portion size!) was all exceptional! We started off with the chicken curry puffs, which were great and samosa-like, with a fantastic sweet dipping sauce. We then shared the chicken pad see ew and beef red curry. The food came out very quickly! We were very pleased with the seasoning and flavors of both! A+ experience overall, and I can't wait to go back and try the duck pho!"}
{"text":"This place has the best dumplings! I love them so much. Don't get to go very often but everytime we have been here the food, service and atmosphere was excellent!! If you want things spicy just ask!"}
{"text":"First visit here. The parking lot is very small but the food is amazing. I had coconut soup and the old Siam and I wasn't disappointed. Even my 4 year old loved it!"}
{"text":"My greatest discovery since moving to the Akron area from Columbus. The staff are the sweetest people you will ever meet and each time I return, I'm greeted like family. It takes exceptional skill to turn small talk into genuine interest.   However, I don't order food for hospitality, so on to the food. The pho is THEE BEST PHO I have ever had in my life. I am ready to travel to Bangkok just to see if there is a worthy contender. The pho comes in a huge portion that I am able to split with my toddler (who is also a huge fan) and STILL have more to eat the next day.  I have also had the pad Thai which was MASSIVE. Definitely getting your money's worth on that dish. It felt at least 8lbs when I picked up the plate.   The crab Rangoon comes with a sauce that I can not describe any other way than addicting. It would probably make a rain boot taste delicious."}
{"text":"Yummm. This place was so delicious. We tried the Monsoon Chicken, Shrimp Blankets and Pad Thai. Everything was mouthwatering. The portions are huge so you can definitely share or plan on going home with leftovers.  Frances was our waitress and she was awesome. Completely knowledgeable on the Thai food traditions and helped us make a decision on our meals.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My first time here and Lemongrass didn't disappoint. Our waitress provided very quality customer service throughout the visit. She knew the menu and the items very well. She made sure we were well-taken-of and made the visit just that much better by the way she treated us. The food came out in a timely manner, was exactly as described, and tasted fantastic (I ordered the Pad Thai). I kept wanting to not overeat, but it was so good I cleaned my plate and left very satisfyingly full. Also...don't let the parking lot fool you, it's not nearly as crowded in the restaurant as the parking lot might lead you to believe. The lot was full, but the restaurant had plenty of room and felt comfortable - not crowded or noisy. Just overall, a very good dining experience. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  My favorites are the Green Curry (will NEVER get sick of it) and the Old Siam. Nice filling portions & the couple that runs it are always happy to see you come in the door. The tastiest food while also seeming to be made in a healthy manner."}
{"text":"Delicious, hot meals FAST! Friendly staff, clean dining room, and large menu. Something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Beyond excited to have a great place to eat in Munroe Falls. It's a beautiful and clean restaurant inside and out. The staff is very nice and friendly and keep up with your plates and drinks. The food is quality and comes promptly.   My mom and I ordered Crab Rangoon for an appetizer and we both had Pad Thai for our entrees. For dessert we tried fried bananas with chocolate ice cream. What a phenomenal meal overall. The mixed drink I ordered was also excellent. In a previous visit my mom spilled her drink and two servers who were not our server jumped in with towels and offered to replace her drink which to me was amazing.   I have never done an online review but it's so nice to have a place to eat so close to home and it's such a great restaurant that I want to make sure people know it's here so that it stays for a long time."}
{"text":"You must eat here if you like Thai! The portions are ginormous! Delicious food- we've had several plates but my go-to is the Pad Thai. The drink selection is also pretty impressive!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. I have gone 3 times since I learned about it.  Each time, I haven't even gotten to order a main dish. I end up getting appetizers to spilt with my fam.  They are so, so yummy. Shrimp blankets and Ragoon are amazing.  The Ragoon is a little different than others.  The taste is just delicious."}
{"text":"The Pho, Pad Thai, drunken noodle, and curry were all decent. Not the best or worst I've had. The crab Rangoon and summer rolls were lacking flavor.  There was a piece of wax paper in one of our crab rangoon and I had a shard of broken plastic in my pho. They were apologetic about these issues, but only took $3 off my meal and gave us 2 extra crab rangoon as compensation."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place recently. She's a big fan of pho and we're both big fans of seafood. Lemongrass Grill's seafood pho just might be the best meal in the history of ever. Highly recommended. And the crab rangoon is the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"We came here with a big group for my boyfriend's birthday and had a great meal! I bought him the very boozy Volcano drink, which was embarrassing in size (which is what I was going for) but delicious. He got green curry with duck, which I ended up eating a good portion of because it was SO. TASTY. He is a curry snob so his bar is set very high. It was a large portion and he ate it for...well, late night snack after we left. I got the pad see ew, which I always judge a Thai restaurant by. It was good. Not my favorite pad see ew, as it was lacking certain depth of flavor and didn't have much sauce. Nice atmosphere too! Overall a great meal, all of our friends enjoyed it too."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Summit County!!! Great service clean environment and the food is always fresh and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Good large  fresh ginger salad. Coconut soup interesting. Unique taste. Good Long Island. Pad Thai not bad, but not good. Not spicy enough. Not fan of the bamboo shoots."}
{"text":"Amazing! My glass of wine was a full glass  I got the coconut chicken soup as an appetizer and I wanted to lick the bowl. It was SO delicious. I got the spicy rice with shrimp for my entree and couldn't finish it all. It was absolutely delicious. This place was AMAZING! My stomach is full and I'm VERY happy!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere at the new Thai place in town. I got the crispy duck, she got the stir fry. We were both very satisfied. I've eaten all the local Thai places and travel quite a bit to others. This place is on par and little bit cheaper than average. I asked for a bit of hot oil for my dish and they brought out roasted hot pepper that was amazing. Also the Thai iced tea here is huge! Good date place."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been talking about trying Lemongrass Grill for so long, and we finally took the plunge. I'm so glad we did!  Almost every table was taken on a Saturday night. They do take reservations, so we were seated right away. Our waitress was Robin and she was exceptional. She knew the menu really well, and was quick with advice and recommendations that turned out to be great.   The Crab Rangoon appetizer was fantastic. The filling was rich, creamy and packed with flavor. The accompanying sweet and sour sauce was really tasty too, and that usually isn't my thing.  So that you know how spicy a meal will be, they have peppers labeled next to some of the entrees. Some dishes have none, others 1, and a couple have a 2 pepper rating.   The MVP of the night was the Red Curry w/ Chicken entree. It was labeled as a 2 pepper meal, which is their spiciest. It was that perfect balance of feeling some heat, but not wiping sweat off your forehead in the bathroom and needing a glass of milk. If you're someone who doesn't like spicy foods, you could probably still get away with ordering this. I don't have much experience with curry, so my tastebuds got a new experience that turned out to be delicious. It's chicken with veggies in a curry type sauce. I almost asked for a spoon to drink the remaining curry like a soup. I ended up pouring it on my rice which was so good. This dish was unlike anything I'd ever had. The coconut taste was a perfect pairing with the spiciness of the curry pepper flavor.  My wife ordered the Yin and Yang.  It combines tofu with a meat of your choice, which she chose chicken. It had deep-fried tofu, stir-fried with sweet onion,bell pepper, broccoli, snow peas, egg, and a chilli sauce. It was 1 pepper on the spicy meter. She really enjoyed it, especially the tofu.  They offer bubble tea, and I highly highly  recommend the honeydew flavor. It was insanely tasty. It would make for a great dessert as well. If you don't get a bubble tea, you made a mistake.   Even though I was so full I could barely move, we got the deep fried banana and ice cream to top things off. It was  good, but I don't know that I would ever necessarily crave it.   We didn't get it, but the table next to us ordered the tiki bowl for two, and I was jealous. Its a shared cocktail that comes in a round shaped bowl/dish, with a shot that is on fire in the middle. It looked pretty awesome.   2 drinks, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and shared dessert was $50, which is pretty reasonable I think. I'd definitely recommend sticking with their spicier dishes. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Lemongrass Grill is located in Munroe Falls just a few miles down the road from the Darrow Road Kent Road intersection. The parking area is very small and they are busy. Only room for 15-20 cars.  We ordered take out and had picked the Roasted Garlic Shrimp w/ rice, Drunken Beef Stir Fry, and crab rangoon. Their menu is large and had traditional and Thai fusion items. They also have Americanized Chinese items for the less adventurous eaters.  The two employees at the counter when I walked in were small children, 10-12 years old ,and much to my surprise they were taking phone in orders as well as cashing out guests. I told them my name and they got my order and read it back to me. They somehow made both of my entrees as chicken. Much to his credit he quickly corrected the mistake and in about 5 minutes we had the correct food.  After arriving home we dug in as it smelled amazing! The crab rangoon was well done and was sweeter/less oniony than the typical Chinese restaurant type. The dipping sauce for the rangoon was sweet with a touch of acidity.   As for the entrees both were good. The roasted garlic shrimp was well done but not super flavourful (not surprising but my wife enjoys simple flavours and cannot handle spicy dishes). My drunken stir fry was excellent! Large portion with a great mix of veggies and noodles. The spice was minimal by my standards (spice level 2 of 5 on their menu) so if you want extra heat ask for them to add extra.   This is our new go to for Thai food, and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant multiple times and have always loved it, have recommended it to other people. I got the phuket stir fry and did not like it what so ever. The server took it away and still charged me for the entree. We asked me her why and she was going to grab the owner for us. He explained to me this isn't a place where you can just sample stuff and that he couldn't resell the dish. I told him i simply didn't enjoy the taste of it and want it taken off and he said that wasn't possible and i told him i wouldn't be returning and he said that was fine... needless to say i won't be visiting again"}
{"text":"I feared the food would not be great and it was worse than I imagined.  I love drunken noodles and can't find them at my local favorite restaurants, so I was very excited. However, the dish couldn't have been more disappointing. Their summer rolls, another favorite, is served with their panaang curry sauce and it just isn't right. I will continue to patronize Thai Gourmet and other area Thai Restaurants and am sad that I don't have a better option in this space."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I thought the reviews were a bit over rated. I had the monsoon chicken, it was like eating bland chicken soaked in hot sauce. The only thing that my wife and I enjoyed were the crab wontons which were really good. But then again anything fried is hard to mess up."}
{"text":"Great, quick service and delicious food! Perfectly proportion enough to take home. We ordered Blanket shrimp, which was a little different from what most blanket shrimps are but super tasty! Pho was good and I also ordered Drunken Fish in which I highly recommend! will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place is DEFINITELY worth trying!   Anytime I try a new Thai restaurant I have to order either a beef or pork Pad Thai.  I ordered the pork Pad Thai with the Thai Iced Tea.  The Thai Iced tea was HUGE!  I would say at least 24 oz.  It lasted through the meal.  The meal...AMAZING!  I could not believe the size of this dish for the lunch price of $7.95!!! The oval shaped bowl was probably 10\" by 5\" and the dish was practically overflowing to the point where my chopsticks would barely fit on the plate!  My roommate ordered the beef pho noodle soup and her portion size was gigantic!  Neither one of us could finish our meals because we were so full!  Plus, we were able to take it all home and honestly I had enough for another whole meal and my roommate had soup for two days!  Amazing!  What made this lunch an incredible experience even more so was that our total for lunch was $24.45! We were impressed and given a lunch that will be hard to match and beat at any other Thai restaurant.  I found there to be only TWO small downsides: ONE; NO BUBBLE TEA.  Small inconvenience for such good food with huge portions though. Two; Lemongrass is literally 100 yards away from the railroad tracks.  I made a joke with my roommate about how I could see a guy bringing one of us here on a date and saying, \"This has been an amazing night.\" Then just as he says that a train flies by wailing on the horn!  We chuckled at that because it wasn't too much of a bother to us but with Lemongrass having mostly windows all the way around the restaurant, sound insulation is pretty slim.  I could see this being a problem for others who do want that PERFECT date night.  Still, I would LOVE to come here on a date.  I would love to stop in for lunch and I would love to come back here!  This is a wonderful place to eat regardless of the occasion and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Thai food!  UPDATE:  Some time between our last visit and recently they now have Bubble Tea!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Horrible! I could go on about the awful service or sub par food, but instead I'll just tell you this....eating an appetizer and got a inch long peice of metal  (clearly from opening a can) stuck in my gums.  I alerted our server who was \"kind\" enough to give us 10% off the offending app. Wtf! My teeth hurt every time I pass this place. They send annoyed that I would complain about an appetizer that stabbed me and drew blood. Terrible service. Doesn't say much that the food was obviously from a can, either."}
{"text":"The entrees were good, but the Crab Rangoon appetizer was \"off.\" With this Crab Rangoon I couldn't taste or see the crab or the scallions. It was a runny cream cheesy boring inside. The wrapper for the Rangoon was nice and light though.  The Chicken Pad Thai was very good and I had enough for lunch the next day. The Beef Curry looked good from what I could see because my wife only let me taste the beef. The next time I looked her plate was empty. Bottom line - work on the crab rangoon, the entrees were winners, nice place for a quick inexpensive bite to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely love to go here for the Pho!  It is delicious and full of flavor.  The curry dishes are also very good.  The crab Rangoon is different than most as it has a sweet flavor wrapped in a delicate pastry.  My daughter swears it is the best!  You can also enjoy bubble tea and Thai tea. You won't be disapointed!"}
{"text":"The food we had at Lemongrass was all really good. We did their bundle appetizer which included several different things. Two of us ordered Massaman curry extra spicy and the third opted for a different chicken & veggie dish (I don't recall the name of it). No one was disappointed, but I will agree with the other posts, a few things need to be worked out.   Our waitress seemed confused about our order completely. She kept thinking one of us was going to eat just the appetizer plate. Then she thought we were all sharing 1 dish of Massaman curry and nothing else. It took quite awhile to clear up that we were sharing an appetizer and each getting our own dish. We also repeatedly asked for \"very spicy\" to which she kept saying \"okay, but it's going to be realllly hot.\" Not to be rude, but this is a THAI restaurant. If I ordered spicy, I mean it.   Our food came and it was anything but spicy. When she returned awhile later we had to ask for hot chili oil to add to the dishes. Then we asked to split the bill onto two different cards. Instead of doing that, she only charged my card twice and never charged the other person.  I can't hold any of this against the restaurant, only our waitress that day. I hope she gets better acclimated and gains a better understanding of customer requests.   That being said, I'm getting their take out tonight. Hopefully it comes out spicy :)"}
{"text":"My husband & I have been waiting for months to finally see this place open and were pleased with the atmosphere and friendliness of the staff. Although it is somewhat casual, it is also somewhat business casual as well & would be a nice, quiet place to take a date or have good conversation with clients.    I ordered their drunken noodles with chicken, I have to admit, I've had better. It's not that it was bad, I just didn't feel it had enough sauce and it was somewhat bland. But my husband loved their pho & said it was better than the other local restaurants! We also enjoyed their hot tea (I'm not sure what type it was) and beautiful presentation of their dishes.    I would gladly go back & give this place a second try, I can't wait to try their pumpkin topped custard!"}
{"text":"After trying nearly every Thai restaurant in the Akron area, this has become our go to. Awesome portion sizes and very flavorful. Owners are extremely nice as well. We highly recommend the red curry. Sadly, their pad see ewe and pad Thai aren't as good as other places, but the curry and other creative dishes more than make up for it!"}
{"text":"I pass by the the Lemongrass Grill often and always wanted to try it. Once our previous favorite Thai place went out of the business we needed to find a new pho spot. This is definitely the place! The BEST crab rangoon in town. Everything seemed very fresh and was super delicious. The interior is not what I was expecting. High industrial style ceilings, modern cement floor, really clean and unique. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place about a month ago and I've already been back twice! Out of all the Thai restaurants I've been to in this area, this one stands out in stark contrast to the others. The decor is very contemporary and quite refreshing compared to the relatively tacky decor of some other Thai restaurants I've been to.   The food, oh the food, is wonderful. I have to admit that I've had the drunken stir fry with chicken every time I've visited because it's that good. One thing I love about this place is that you can choose between jasmine or brown rice. I prefer brown rice over all other rice options so this is a plus for me. I've had two different appetizers--steamed dumplings and crab Rangoon--and to say that both appetizers are phenomenal is not an exaggeration. The steamed dumplings are hand stuffed and pinched. The crab Rangoon were easily the best I've ever had and they were definitely made fresh and not from frozen. The food is always delivered quickly and plated with finesse.   I've also had a cocktail here --the suffering bastard-- that was delicious. Overall, I can't sing enough praises about this place. But don't just take my word for it, try it yourself!"}
{"text":"I am excited to have a Thai restaurant in Munroe Falls. The atmosphere is wonderful, and the staff is friendly. The food was good, but not great. In fact, I have had better in every other local Thai restaurant. The pad Thai was over cooked and bland. It tasted like ketchup over mushy noodles. My husband loved the garlic shrimp, but again, the veggies were over cooked. The Thai iced tea was delicious, and so were the shrimp rolls. We got a carry out menu, so we're willing to try again. I'm hoping the restaurant improves and prospers."}
{"text":"First off the service is amazing! The Crab Rangoon is light and airy and very delicious, probably the best I've ever had! Ordered the Drunken Fish and was terrific, full of flavor! Veggies were very fresh & delicious. Would recommend this new restaurant to anyone!!"}
{"text":"I had an exceptional experience at Lemongrass! Our waitress was one of the best servers I've ever had. She was friendly, engaging, and quick to explain the menu to us when we looked a little lost. The food itself was delicious. I had the Thai Drunken Noodles while my companion chose a Curry dish. Both were full of meat and veggies, not just some sprinkled on top of pasta, unlike some places. The dishes do run a little spicy but order a bubble tea and you will be just fine. Did I mention they have bubble tea???   I completely enjoyed my experience and plan on becoming a regular as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here I am wondering if all these people are reviewing the Lemongrass Grill in Munroe Falls?  We went soon after the grand opening and we were very disappointed.  The waitress spilled our drinks all over the table, I had soda on my shirt and if we had not been wearing shorts our pants would have been soaked.  They had to move us to another table due to all the soda on the floor and table.   The food is over priced, small portions and it took a while for them to serve us.   They charged us full price for everything despite soaking us in soda and staining my shirt.  Drive by today and the empty parking lot speaks volumes about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious, beautifully presented food...good service, too. Everything my fiance and I have ordered there, the several times we've dined there, was very good...and you leave full."}
{"text":"As a Thai food snob, I thought the food was good. The Tom Yum Soup was fantastic. The Pad Thai was a little too saucy for my taste - I like when it's dryer. Asked for Thai Spicy and still had to add extra. Friendly waitstaff -- I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Service is great, prices reasonable, large portions.  And the chicken fried rice with pineapple is soooo delicious."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in awhile. This place is a gem! Food is super fresh and arrives quickly. I definitely will be back."}
