{"text":"Really great sushi. Really friendly staff. Highly recommended if you enjoy sushi. Little bit expensive but definitely worth a visit or two. I especially love the Agadashi Tofu in the appetizers. Love everything else I've tried on the menu."}
{"text":"Really good food and presentation. Great service in a cute location! We loved how big the portions were and how accommodating they were to our needs/requests."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very fresh and presentation is awesome. Definitely my new favourite sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Truly a hidden gem! We enjoyed all the rolls we had (they were blowtorched), and we left very satisfied. I'm just sad this place is so far from home or else I'd be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Not a fancy place but if you are looking for a delicious sushi, this is the right destination. Fresh ingredients, and they have their own style if sushi which I like. Every time i eat there the quality was good so far."}
{"text":"I've gone to some really cheap sushi place with low expectations and was blown away... within reason. I understand the constraints a cheap sushi place has to work with and I set my expectations accordingly. This food was less good than some of those cheap sushi places, but more expensive. I'm not one to gripe about price usually... I'll pay a lot if I know for sure is going to be decent, but I felt a little ripped off here. Either make an effort on the food, or have the price reflect the quality. It was edible, the tuna roll was ok, but the Black Dragon roll was soggy and flavourless. And the spicy salmon roll was a mushy mess that betrayed its lack of freshness. And what are these people putting int he rice to make it purple. It's not that fancy, healthy purple rice, as the menu would have you believe. It's just sushi rice with some purple colouring. It's odd."}
{"text":"Excellent food for a reasonable price! I've been here twice and really enjoy the tempura. Light and crispy, the marks of clean oil and good batter. The restaurant is small, but very clean. It's really close (steps away, really) to the gorgeous Humber Bay Park, so I recommend this place for outings with friends and family. There is free parking along that stretch of Marine Parade-Monday to Friday 8am to 9pm I think. There's free parking on weekends too, but I don't remember the times."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here and it was really good. It's a little pricier than other sushi places that deliver in Etobicoke, but the quality is worth the extra few bucks. The aburi sushi is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Cute little spot in an area that's lacking restaurants and places to visit. Friendly and quick service, will definitely be back for more unagi! A bit on the pricier side but OK if you get a \"meal\" lunch/dinner combos they offer."}
{"text":"Finally a decent sushi and Korean restaurant in the. Neighbourhood!  Staff is friendly. The Aburi sushi rolls are better at miKu but everything else is more than acceptable and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Really good food and even better, a good value! The presentations are great...the vibe is quiet and friendly. Go!"}
{"text":"This is probably the 2nd best sushi resturant (and filling ) in the province (Ontario) because the one in kingston made it a tiny bit better and more fancy, and filling but this one made it better in service, and  rainbow rolls. And I posted that sushi place in kingsto on yelp too!"}
{"text":"The sushi and hot food were REALLY GOOD!!! But kinda sucks that they only gave 2 packets of soy sauce for a $70+ take out order. LOL. It would have been more enjoyable not to worry about running out of soy sauce.. will def come back for the good food though!!!  Edit: They fixed the issue with the soy sauce packets yasss! They started delivering too so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"How can a review of the same place go from 5 stars to 3 stars? It's easy.....just try to eat at Krazy Roll anytime less than 30 minutes before closing. We went for a nice walk along the lake and really looked forward to ending our walk with dinner at Krazy Roll. We got there at 9:30pm, were seated and told we had to order right away because the kitchen was closing. Apparently the kitchen (sushi chef behind the sushi bar) lies to close 20 minutes before actual closing time.  Although I don't like that, I can understand that restaurants have to close. Closing at 10:00pm (or say closer to 9:30pm) on a Friday night just doesn't seem right. Also, when Krazy Roll says they close at 10:00pm, that means lights out nobody in the place by 10:00 pm. But closing preferences aside, the food quality shouldn't go down because you're closing soon.  We ordered the Salmon Terriyaki Dinner and the Bugogi. The rice used in the sushi seemed under cooked and the Bulgogi was bland with lots of fatty meat. And if you're partly a Korean restaurant, then you should have some Korean BBQ sauce for the bulgogi and other dishes.  I will give Krazy Roll one more try maybe mid-day. However judging by the fact that only 2 people were in the place at 9:30pm on a Friday, maybe the newly opened euphoria is dwindling or the food quality is getting worse. And while I was pleasantly surprised by purple rice on the first visit, I think that was short lived. I prefer my sushi rice to be white."}
{"text":"Having owned a sushi restaurant, it takes a lot to impress me, from the quality and portion size of the fish to the flavour and consistency of the sushi rice...and Krazy Roll nails it! I'm a regular and will continue supporting this fantastic family run business."}
{"text":"Was so impressed by the presentation and creativity of the sushi at Krazy Roll. Will definitely be back soon and would recommend going to everyone!"}
{"text":"I loved all I tried there. I'm not understanding the 3.5 stars. The quality of the food is really good, fresh, tasty. For me, the best Japanese food in Toronto. My only complain is the smoke inside the restaurant, but nothing that makes me give them less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ok so tried in dining today and flavours.werr.good.and service was fast.  Prices are.avg and there are some strange crunchy rolls that have potato chips thrown on top.  Maybe they should use seaweed potato chips to keep it to the theme!?!?  Wish the AC was on and that the e,haunt was better because we got a little smokey and warm so we had to take half our meal to go.  Still ironing out the kinks I think.  Once they get their liquor license I'm sure it will get smoother for them."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here on a Tuesday night and got the edamame, vegetable tempura and dynamite roll. Everything was fresh and nicely presented. Their plates are so cute! The service was friendly and prices were great. I would definitely go back to try more of the menu. The lake shore location is the icing on the cake!"}
