{"text":"It's like a miniature hot pot that doesn't cost as much. If you ask for the dry option, they drain the soup, and add a flavouring similar to the condiments available at hot pots."}
{"text":"Spice and Aroma (Shi Lai Shi Wang in Chinese) is a chain of malatang restaurants in Toronto. Ordering is easy, just pick the items you want with tongs and place them in a big plastic bowl. When you're done, bring the bowl to the cashier and select the level of spiciness (I'm usually pretty good with spicy stuff but I found medium to be quite spicy especially combined with the steaming broth). At this stage, you can also choose to add extra protein such as lamb, beef or fish for an extra $2. Overall, this place is what you would expect from a typical malatang although the broth was just a tad too salty for me."}
{"text":"I've tried both the wet and dry version. I much prefer the wet version. I ordered the wet version medium spicy and it had the right amount of spice. I suggest you start with medium spicy (if you like spicy), and then make your way up if you do so desire. In my opinion, if you like spicy foods and Chinese hot pot, this is the perfect place for you. This is also a good place to eat by yourself or with someone else. The problem I have is that I need to learn how to portion control. I load my bucket with veggies, meats and noodles that it can get quite expensive. However, if you can't finish, you can always ask for a takeout bowl. That's 2 meals for the price of 1."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese malatang place, offering mouth-numbing spicy build-your-own-bowl noodle soups. Great for a quick meal or a spice challenge. You can sit-in or take-away.

Upon entering the restaurant, you will be greeted by a dozen fortune cats and a plant, which is quite extravagant. There is a table with two seats near the front, which are their window seats I suppose.

Other than that, you'll probably find yourself in an empty room with a bunch of cat statues.  Just continue inside and someone will come and greet you. They will ask you if this is your first time here, and will explain how the place works if you would like an explanation.

You start by picking up a basin and fill it up with any ingredients that you would like in your noodle soup. A selection of seafoods (think fish balls), vegetables, and noodles are available for your taking, at $1.89 per 100 grams (subject to change).

Then you head over to the counter where they'll ask you what degree of spice you want (no spice, a little spicy, medium, spicy, and very spicy).

At this point, you can choose to add meats for your bowl for $2 per portion, and then finish it off with some garnishes.

Drinks are available, though they are sitting on a bookshelf beside the cashier.

I ended up with a bowl for $9 after tax including one portion of meat, but I was being conservative. The medium spicy (50%) was pretty spicy, but don't be afraid to be adventurous.

Note: Washrooms are surprisingly clean and quite spacious."}
{"text":"This location is the former J and C Tasty House. The restaurant offers a Chinese Soup Bar experience. The soup bar is quite interesting and this is my first time. Food tastes good but is reliant on what you self select as ingredients. Yes, that's right, it is a make your own soup approach. The kitchen does the final preparation. The staff pay close attention to cleanliness.

Would have given 4 stars but, the space and the ambience needs a complete enhancement.

Will recommend."}
{"text":"this place is not very clean, i saw how they cook at back, the cook wearing dirty gloves dumps garbage and then grab a cabbage to cut, it freaks me out. 
also the beef tripe is dry like cardboard i have no idea how they cooked it or maybe its not fresh?"}
{"text":"Decent ma la soup broth, with a pick your own ingredients and protein counter. The instructions for how to do so are vague, and I had to observe other people in order to understand how to go through the process of ordering. 

Staff were friendly, price was alright for what you ordered. It definitely varies depending on what items you choose as some are naturally heavier than others."}
{"text":"You pick the toppings you want in your noodle soup and they add protein, the spicyness and voila - you have yourself a large, large bowl of noodle soup. I've always gone for no spicy and found it on the salty end. Do remember that people typically have a tendency to overestimate the amount of food they'll eat, so you might end up putting a ton of ingredients in your basin only to discover you can't finish it all off. There also aren't too many seats, so a lot of folks do take-out or you risk having to wait around for an empty seat or two."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the only Chinese hot spicy dip restaurant in Mississauga, as far as I know. It is a chained restaurant, and you may find the other ones in North York or somewhere north of Toronto. 

It is fairly authentic in terms of the taste and the process of picking your favourite ingredients for the dip. There are five levels of spice, and customers can choose the dip with soup base or dry base. Besides that, we can also choose different kinds of meat, such as beef, lamb and pork as well as shrimps. It is very convenient for people who are running a busy schedule or taking a lunch break. The price isn't cheap tho because the ingredients are fairly basic, and if people would like to have more meat, you have to pay extra on top of the weights of the ingredients you picked. 

The quality of these ingredients sometimes can be some issues. You may find razor clams and mussels among the ingredients. However, they are soaking in the water, which the water doesn't look clean (maybe the clams and mussels are in there for some time). We had a group of four to have dinner there, and two of them had a stomachache after having the clams. However, it's not often, as long as you don't pick these river seafood, other ingredients look fairly fresh and clean. 

If you don't have time to go to this place, I will suggest you order it on the Foodhwy, so you will be able to try it out by having it delivered. Again, I rated a three-star because of the rare food quality issue. Since it doesn't happen often on me, I still like to go there once a while."}
{"text":"A nice ma la tang(it's like premade hotpot) place. It seems pretty popular, since there was only one empty table when we arrived. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Their food is delicious and reasonably priced (~$10-$15 per person). A decent joint overall, but nothing too spectacular."}
{"text":"MaLaTang is one of my most favorite Chinese dishes. Before we've travelled to Toronto, I have heard that there are so many MaLaTang restaurants there.  Spicy & Aroma is one of the MaLaTang restaurants. It located at Spadina Ave Toronto China Town and only 15 mins away from the University of Toronto. The location is very easy to find and convenience for those Chinese Students who are studying at UofT.

I've been to this restaurant on my 3rd day in Toronto. I arrived the restaurant right after the lunch time, so there are no many customers there. This restaurant is the same as Vancouver Yang Guo Fu MaLaTang that all the ingredients (meat and vegetable) are displayed on shelves. Customers can pick their desired ingredients into a bowl. Then, the shop will charge them based on the weight of the bowl. Differently, People can select their own level hotness during they order the food. The restaurant serves people different seasoned sauces, such as garlic, black pepper, Sichuan pepper, chili pepper, sesame paste and crushed peanuts, on their Ma La Tang. So, people don't have to put those seasoned sauces by themselves.

The MaLaTang I had, was very cheap. It was only $13. Everything in my bowl was well cooked. Taste of my food was very authentic. It was a great experience. I highly recommend people to go Spicy & Aroma."}
{"text":"I've stumbled onto this chain in Scarborough when I was in Toronto for school. I accidentally stumbled onto it again when I was in Mississauga and Yelped for some spicy noodles. 

The restaurant is well-lit and clean. It leans more towards utility than ambiance.  You'll see 2 counters with raw ingredients that you're going to use to make your noodle soup.  This ranges from veggies to meats and noodles to tofu and quail egg.  The price by the weight of your bowl at the end.  It's like a frozen yogurt where you place all your ingredients in and then pay at the end.  The server will ask you for here or to go, spiciness level (watch out, the chili peppers are real), any extra meat, and if you want onions, cilantro etc.  

Seating is limited, around 20 but if somebody takes up a table it's hard to sit at the same table. So avoid rush hour times !

The service here is excellent. They keep the place clean. The staff does speak English so if you don't know Mandarin it isn't a problem. I've watched a server explain each ingredient to a new customer (and there's a lot!) and how the whole process works. 

I come here about once a week from Hamilton which means I land into rush hour most of the time. 

Tip: fibre is necessary to consume before or after meal."}
{"text":"Thanks to a friends recommendation, we swung by this place one weeknight to try it out.  Ever since then, we were hooked and we wanted to go times after that but I guess during the holiday their schedule is totally off. The hours on yelp are wrong. Friend says the hours on their paper says 11-11 everyday. This place is located in Cooksville of Mississauga right on Dundas/Hurontario. The restaurant is really small with maybe about 20 seats available and the area to pick your ingredients isn't big. It can get pretty cramped up if there's a rush of people. I feel like, their heating system is really weak or it's broken LOL. It was so cold when I went to eat there - plus the door is right beside the seating area and you can feel a draft. My friend went another time for lunch and said it was like a freezer in there. During the winter I would advise wearing a thicker sweater and socks there to eat.. or just wear your jacket. BUT BEWARE, SOUP WILL STAIN. 

This place is basically a create your own noodle bowl (soup or stir-fried). I was impressed by how good it tasted. There are a lot of ingredients you can choose from! There's a large bowl there where you put all the ingredients in and you bring it up to cash where the person weighs it. I'm not sure what the $ is by weight but an average bowl can cost around $10. Meats are additional costs: $3 extra. The beef and lamb are the ones you would normally see in hot pot boxes (sliced rolls). I would add beef to it. It compliments the soup! I generally prefer spicy soups so I got 2nd highest spice and yup it burrrnss your mouth BUT adds SO much flavour to it. I will def come back again!!"}
