{"text":"The view is really the first thing we came here for. The second was their talked about 'crab burger'. We got both. The view is nice and enjoyable and relaxing. The crab burger is quite simple on the toppings with nice soft texture on the patty. 

Crab Burger ($17)

Brussel Sprouts ($10)- Grilled and mixed in with sweet chili sauce. Nice but not the greatest use of brussel sprouts like other places I've had.

Fried Calamari ($13)- Was a bit cold when we got it. Likely breaded and goes with some ranch dip. It was alright.

Would come back just for the view and the burger...

Also the plus is FREE parking!"}
{"text":"Beautiful right on lake
The Salmon was great 
Crab cake burgers awesome
Bea and Heather gave super service
Try the Portuguese tarts for dessert 
In all decent prices and amazing service and food"}
{"text":"The atmosphere alone made the 20 minute drive for dinner worth it. 

Entirely outdoors with an breathtaking view of Musselmans Lake; the cute patio tables, big umbrellas, and sparkling lights were icing on the cake. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful, and she had a big smile on her face whenever she spoke with us. We decided to split a simple cheese pizza, and it was definitely standard but still very good. 

Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely be going back when it reopens!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to \"Fishbones by the Lake\" since it opened and watched it evolve. The thing that has not changed is the fabulous view off the balcony. The food is fabulous although the menu is limited and doesn't change much.  The service is exceptionally good as it is at all the Fishbone restaurants. It is best on off hours as it is pretty popular and wait times can be painful on nice summer evenings. It's only open during the summer and with good weather so it can be h hit and miss but well worth the trip. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and it was a wonderful experience. The perfect place for a patio! They have lots of parking available. Right across from their restaurant, there is a parking lot just for customers. Seems like this place is full all the time. Not a surprise since the view and food is great. 

When we arrived, it was a 45 minute wait for us. They have couch seating below their patio which was very comfy and you could order drinks while waiting. 

I ordered the Crispy Wings and Pizza. The crispy wings definitely lives up to it's name. So crispy! We got the salt& pepper flavour. It was seasoned so perfectly. For salt & pepper wings, this was the best i've ever had. As for the pizza, we got Bravo. Definitely yummy, but nothing special to me. For dessert, I had 2 scoops of Chocolate Gelato which also comes with a biscotti. The biscotti was super hard and pretty much flavourless. In a way I guess it's a good combination since the gelato is sweet. The gelato tasted just like regular chocolate icecream. 

Also, service was surprisingly great. Usually coming to these places I could expect some snotty attitude from employees. But everyone was so friendly and the server was very attentive. 

Overall, a great experience and wonderful view! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great view, great good, great service.

Came by for dinner service and had to wait an hour-ish for a table but it was worth it. Although we didn't get a view right beside the water, we were pretty close and it was still amazing watching the sunset as we ate.

The food is great, we got the calamari (no more mussels for the night), their pizza and a pasta. Calamari was great - I really like the small peppers in it, pizza and pasta was alright.

Would definitely come back to try other items on their menu and enjoy the view some more."}
{"text":"What can I say? A HIDDEN gem in Stouffville. Their Main Street location is gorgeous but their lakeside location is perfect for an evening out under the stars. Situated literally looking over musselman's lake their big white umbrellas shade you from the sun and at night the string of twinkle lights drape over your head over the most fabulous deck.
The food is fabulous. Upscale gourmet Portuguese pub food is my explanation. Their Brussel Sprout appetizer is AMAZING! I had the Crab Burger last time I was there and it is also mouth watering. My friend had the Tagliatelle which she said was delicious and we couldn't resist ordering a side 12\" Mediterranean pizza. The menu is too delicious to not go BIG! 
This is the most perfect date spot - expect to be there for a few hours as table turnover doesn't seem to be quick."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great. The view, the food, the drinks -- everything about Fishbone was perfect. I would be weary about the bees though, they do tend to fly around the delicious food. ;) 

The Ahi Tuna is a good appetizer to start. It opens the palate for everything that you're about to experience so it's a definitely must order. The bolognese was also a favourite of mine and I would definitely order it again. 

The pink mojito was also a really good choice as it was the perfect summer drink. :) 

This place is only open for the summer and it does tend to be a popular place. I can definitely see why because everything was amazing. Do note that they only take reservations for groups of 8 or more. So we went a litter later (2PM) just so we wouldn't have to wait but it definitely would have been worth it if we had to. 

I'm definitely returning this upcoming summer for another taste test!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service! Try the brussel sprouts (no really). Very reasonable prices. Wish they were open year round!"}
{"text":"Would recommend this place for their relaxing lakeside view! 

Food 4/5
Food was overall delicious. 

PEI mussels $15
Mussels tasted fresh and came in a decent portion. However the bread that was provided we too tough and did not pair well with the mussels.

Beef and lamb burger $18
Burger was juicy and they gave a generous portion of fries. 

We also ordered 2 cocktails - watermelon margarita $12 and pomegranate mojito $11.
2oz alcohol. Super refreshing. But the watermelon chunks in the drink made it kind of hard to drink.

Service 4.5/5
Servers were polite and professional but also personable and funny. 

Atmosphere 4.5/5
The lake view is beautiful! Come here during sunset to make it a romantic date ;)"}
{"text":"Beautiful view. Atmosphere solid 4 stars. I personally find the main can use a little more work. The cod was a bit tasteless. But the service was great. 

I actually prefer the appetizers here over the main. The Brussel sprouts tasted good. After my brother tried it, he asked if his girlfriend can make him some. 

Overall amazing view at the patio for a afternoon drink with friends and family. Always here every summer as this restaurant is only opened in the summer time!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for Friday evening. The location of this restaurant is enticing as it is located right on the musselman lake. Nice ambience as the dining area is on a patio on the lake, and the service was good too. Ordered PEI mussels and fritata fries for appetizers... The mussels were prepared okay. For main course, ordered Irish organic Grilled Salmon and Grilled Sea bass fillets. Portions were really small for the price per main course, but both Salmon and Sea bass were prepared well, and tasted delicious. To me, highlight of the evening was the Portuguese custord tarts dessert! A must order item!

Overall, I would say that if you are looking for a restaurant with a private lake scenery, then its a good place to go for some light appetizers and coffee. However, the main course dishes are a bit on the pricey side and you may end up hungry even after having the main course"}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful atmosphere! You can go to enjoy a delicious meal and look out onto the lake or grab a drink at the bar and lounge on the outdoor couches. You feel like you are on vacation!"}
{"text":"This place actually had no reviews when we tried it, earlier this year. We saw it on TV, and decided to take a drive - was worth every km driven.

The setting is great, the staff are very friendly, and the food is delicious - what more can you ask for?

Will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"A beautiful lake view and impeccable service from Omid (\"tell him everything\") made our visit truly memorable. We had a party of 13 ladies and were seated at one end of the restaurant where we took lots of photos.

Customer service is of primary importance to me, so this review would centre on that. Omid was patient, attentive and charming even though we were rather \"high-maintenance\":  some in our group arrived pretty late, we shared appetizers (read: used plenty of dishes) and we kept adding orders and asking for refills. 

We were pleased to see another service staff offer a blanket to a young male customer who was in a T-shirt (temperature dipped when the sun set). And we were delighted when they offered us the same, even though most of us had coats with us. 

Food tasted great: We had Brussel Sprouts, Shrimp Tacos, Bread with Olive & Herb spread for Appetizers. Entrees: Half of us had the Icelandic Cod Omid recommended, the rest of us had the Crab Burger, Salmon, Magherita Pizza, a salad. Wish the restaurant provided a bread basket at the start coz we were all hungry and just sipping drinks while we waited for the Appetizers.

Another thing the restaurant could do: burn some citronella candles or something to keep the mosquitoes at bay. There were a few buzzing around so we used our own insect repellant. 

The ladies washroom was clean and surprisingly large ~ there were about 6 stalls in there. 

All in all, a lovely place with amazing service. Quite a few of us decided we will be back again this summer!"}
{"text":"This hidden place up by musselman lake has a great view while you enjoy your dinner. The service was great but you do have to wait a bit for a table since it is quite busy in the summer time. Food is a little bit pricey for the amount you get unfortunately. Our bill came up to $200 for 4 people with 3 drinks and we weren't really full. The food was great don't get me wrong but they didn't give us a lot. The Ahi Tuna Poke is really good if you are going!"}
{"text":"THIS, is my new fav spot! I love that a place as beautiful as Musselman Lake is so close to the city without having to drive hours to get near water. Especially when it includes a restaurant right by the lake! It took a while for me to get there (reservations are highly recommended!), but  we managed to snag a reservation the weekend before they closed for the season.

Just a short 20 minute drive from Markham. Even faster if you don't spend time checking out all the great places in Stouffville during the drive to Musselman Lake.

We arrived 10 min late - not by choice, but because our sitter was late. We found (free) parking very easily in the lot across the street. It was a busy Sunday at 1:30pm. We went up to the hostess, who was very nice and greeted us very warmly. We apologized for being late, gave our name with reservation info and asked if there was a table right in front of the water. Let's be real though, the whole patio is overlooking the water, so anywhere you sit is a huge bonus with the beautiful view. We waited a couple of minutes at most and then we were seated in the centre of the patio right by the rails overlooking the beach & water! I could've just sat there with a glass of water all day! 

We ordered our drinks - pomegranate mojitos. Oh my! Deliciously refreshing on a warm sunny day. 

Our (3 of us) appetizers were:
Bread Board - just enough for 2-3 to share if you're getting a 2nd appetizer. I just wish they would give a few extra slices of bread. We asked, but they wanted to charge us, so we passed. Since we had a 2nd app. we were working on and our mains coming out.

Deep Fried Brussel Sprouts - I LOVE brussel sprouts! The way they made theirs with peanuts, deep fried with the sweet chilli sauce was amazing! If you've never tried brussel sprouts or have and don't like them - you must try them at Fishbone By the Lake! 

Hubby & i ordered the Bavette Steak with chimichurri sauce and fries. It was grilled and cooked to absolute medium perfection! Great portion size too. The chimichurri sauce & grilled tomatoes on top tasted so fresh and complimented the steak so well. The only way i could describe bavette steak is that it is like skirt steak, but a bit more tender. Don't ask for anything but medium because then you will have a very tough piece of steak. Bavette steak is thin like skirt & flank steak.

Our guest ordered the Grilled Mediterranean Bass which was served with: Pickled Fennel Orange Salad, Charred Lemon, Caper Onion Relish. She loved her meal! Everything was fresh, flavours meshed well and the presentation was stunning! All of their menu items are light & fresh. Perfect for a patio overlooking the lake on a sunny day. 

We ended up staying for just over 3 hours, eating, talking & enjoying the beautiful view! The service there was excellent during our visit. Our server came by at all the right times for drink refills etc. They closed for the season on September 4th. I'm so glad we made it there this year, i can't wait to go back next Summer!

I highly recommend making reservations. It is always busy there with Cedar Beach resort campsite & trailer park just across the street. Even though you feel as though you are so far out of the city by the lake, it is in Stouffville and a 20 min drive from Markham. 

*We didn't make reservations online through their website. Every time i tried to book a table it told me that there were no tables within 2-3 hours of the times i was selecting. We got our reservation by stopping by (we were shopping in Stouffville) and talking to the hostess. We ended up getting a time/date that the website said wasn't even available."}
{"text":"Great view - checked, romantic - checked, great food - checked!  My friend CT been telling me about Fishbone by the lake and I finally came here with JC on the weekend!  Since they do not take reservation unless you have 8 or more, so we decided to go a little later hoping we don't need to wait long.

Arrived at 2pm and we did not have to wait, was seated at a table close to the lake and started off with two Pomegranate Mojitos. Since we were both starving, we ordered the PEI Mussels, Ahi Tuna Poke for our appetizer and the Pepe's Pizza and Lamb Bologense for our main.

Ranking our favourite to the least, our favourite was:
1) Ahi Tuna Poke - The tuna was great and fresh, mixing it with the refreshing watermelon cubes and avocado made this dish so delicious and refreshing and is perfect for a starter because it opens up your appetite!! I highly recommend this dish.

2) PEI Mussels - Portion was alright, but the mussels are meaty and big! Using Coconut Piri Piri Broth as the base really brought out the freshness of the mussels.  Another great dish!

3) Lamb Bologense - the sauce was amazing, almost felt like i'm eating at a restaurant specializes in pasta.  Great amount of sauce and lamb meat.  Only recommendation I would make is to make the pasta a little more al-dente, I thought it wasn't chewy enough.

4) Pepe's Pizza - The pizza is still good, very thin cruised and lots of fresh toppings that include Sweet Chorizo Sausage, Mushrooms, Red Bell Peppers, Capers and Red Onion, but the pizza just didn't wow us like the other dishes.

Overall great experience!  Love the romantic lakeside view with great food! One star off the rating is due to the fact that there are a lot of bees, wasps and flies flying around which really had an impact to the whole experience."}
{"text":"First time at the fishbone as we were riding our motorcyle through the area. Tried to get a bite to eat and the host at the reception was being a real a hole. With 6 tables free he said we had to wait 45 minutes. It was 3 pm in the aft. Hope the mgmt can be a little more receptive."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Great ambiance, good service, and very good food. I've been wanting to come here for a long time and finally, on the spur of the moment, I grabbed my best friend and off we went.

We got there a little after 8:00pm as the sun was setting. The lighting made the place look very cozy and intimate. The entire dining area is outdoors under a canopy, overlooking Musselman Lake. Very nice. The lounge area is also very nice, under the trees, lounge chairs with white cushions. Very cozy.

After looking over the menu, we settled on a few apps and a pizza - Beet & Orange Salad, Deep Fried Brussel Sprouts, Crispy Piri Piri Wings, and a Bravo Pizza with chorizo sausage and cremini mushrooms.

I'm not a fan of beets but the salad had layers of great flavour, especially with the goat cheese. Beautiful presentation.

Who would have thought peanuts and brussel sprouts would go well together? They do! Good flavour, good texture, good dish!

The wings were perfectly crispy with just the right amount of piri piri seasoning. Another hit.

The Bravo pizza, with chorizo sausage, cremini mushrooms, onions, and red peppers had a good depth of flavour and crispy crust.

I don't know how but we managed to fit in some dessert - Lindt Chocolate Mousse and Maple Creme Brullee. Both dishes were really good without being too sweet.

This is a great place for a date night. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love love this place. Came here during the summer and love sitting at the patio. Looking at the water and seeing people have fun made a great view. The server was really nice and attentive. Great food too!! Im going to visit every summer. 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice in the past week! I found out that they closed on Sept. 19, 2015 so I wanted to be able to savour the last of the summer days out on their deck. The restaurant's seating area is entirely outside. This place gets very busy so for dinner I'd say get there before 5:30pm. On both occasions service was unremarkable. All of the dishes that we ordered were very good except for the crab sandwich; it was a grave injustice to sandwich the delicately flavoured patty between two cheap, untoasted white bread buns (the kind you'd buy at Walmart) that had no seasoning or pizzazz! Other than that everything was quite tasty including the chocolate mousse dessert. They said they didn't have anymore Portuguese tarts since it was their last weekend. It is actually nice to sit outside even when it rains, although they will close if weather gets too severe. The view is quite lovely. A note to all high-heel wearers, the seating area is a wooden deck and thinner heels can get stuck between some of the boards so I'd say just stick to flats when you visit this place. The washrooms leave a little to be desired; clearly they have not been updated yet, the stalls are tight, some doors are missing locks, but overall they were clean from what I could tell. My family really liked it, my friends loved it, we will be going back next spring!"}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to revisit Fishbone twice in the last week. This remains such a beautiful place to dine. The patio overlooking Musselman's Lake with views over the water is nothing short of gorgeous. As I looked around the patio I noticed many other repeat customers...a sure sign that Fishbone staff is doing something right. The menu is fairly limited (but varied) and as in the past, the deep-fried brussel sprout appetizer is a big hit. The Lindt chocolate mousse desert is worth every calorie. Wait staff is friendly and accommodating and the place is bustling. Each entree was nicely presented and delicious.I hesitate to criticize because I enjoy Fishbone so much...but there is room for improvement in the length of wait between ordering and receiving our meal. I like leisurely dining, but both of our visits took longer than expected. This will remain one of our top places to dine!"}
{"text":"I have been to Fishbone many times in previous years. This year I notice they raised the price which I can understand.  We went there on a Sunday afternoon at 5PM. We were told wait time was about 25 minutes. I noticed there were plenty of empty tables on the deck, I suppose the wait should be very shot. 
After 30 minutes passed, we were told to wait another 10 minutes when plenty of tables were empty. After 40 minutes, we were told again to wait 10 more minutes because they need to set up a table. 
Finally after 52 minutes wait we got our table.  

Total unnecessary wait when tables were empty, waiters were available."}
{"text":"If you get a seat on the patio the view of the lake is beautiful!! But when my crab cake burger and my friend's beef burger are $21, we expect the quality of bun not be a cheap quality Dempster bun you get at No Frills. It should be a home made bun or at least from a bakery if you're paying that kind of $$. You can get a better burger for way cheaper at other burger joints."}
{"text":"First off I must thank Cherrie T. for posting that picture of herself because if she didn't then I would have never of known this restaurant existed. Note to Cherrie T. (I was going to copy the selfie that you took at the very same spot, posing the exact same way but I was also super excited to be there and completely forgot). Anyway, when I saw where it was located on google maps and saw the beautiful scenery, I made sure I went on very my next day off. The drive here is very beautiful with all the farms and greenery, plus there is no traffic. 

I think this restaurant only has outdoor seating and there is no seats inside, which means this place might only open during the spring/summer? I forgot to ask. But who would want to eat inside with the spectacular view of the lake. 

The menu is very small with very few options to choose from but I think this is a good thing so that they can focus on making quality food. I wanted to get the crab burger but the waitress broke my heart/stomach when she said they are no longer offering the crab burger for the remainder of the season :( 

Started off lunch with a $9 alcoholic beverage (pomegranate mojito). They put alot of alcohol in it so you sort of get your moneys worth. 

Fried calamari $13 - tasted fresh and cooked well with nice flavours on the seasoning.

Honey mustard wings $12 - the wings were super small. They were like infant chick sized wings. However, it was done really well. The skin was really crispy just as advertised on the menu. I also think because the wings were so small that it made them more juicy. Great flavours and texture and would not hesitate to order again.

So instead or ordering the crab burger I settled for the Forno Bravo pizza $15. The pizza was really good. It had a nice crunch on the crust and overall tasted good. The only complaint is that they put very little toppings on it. The pizza comes with chicken, goat cheese and red peppers but there were barely any of these toppings. Just regular cheese was the dominate topping. Still tasted okay at least.

Service was excellent and the view of the lake ... amazing."}
{"text":"Stunning view without the long drive. Harder to keep dandelion fluffs and bugs out of your drinks. Friendly service. Menu selection relatively small.  Would love to come back still."}
{"text":"Amazing view and way to find. The place is not very big and only takes reservations for group of 8 or larger. We waited about 30minutes but it was worth it. The crab cake burger and calamari is amazing! Will come back soon~"}
{"text":"I have to say, I have been here a number of times since it opened in 2014. 
The menu is small but very adequate. The food preparation is exceptional, the flavours and textures are great. The staff are very friendly and efficient. You will always find at least one of the owners there. They are very attentive and do an absolutely great job of making you feel so welcome. 
The other thing is the location. Sitting eating a delicious meal overlooking mussel mans lake. Beautiful sun sets all thrown in. 
I would have no hesitation in recommending this place whether you want just a bite or a romantic dinner. Five stars."}
{"text":"Great spot with a view! 

This resto is easy to find with great patio, food and service. 

We came here around 1:30 pm on a Sunday and were seated away. The service was fast and our server was very attentive.  I noticed there were actually a lot of servers and busboys to help out. 

As for the food, our table ordered the deep fried Brussels sprouts, mussels, lamb Bolognese, linguine and pepe pizza.  Everything was very tasty except for the Brussels sprouts. It was overly fried in my opinion. They are also very tiny to begin with so it didn't even taste like Brussels sprouts, more just crispy flakes of some sort.  I'd prefer them to be lightly fried so at least it tastes like I'm biting into a brussels sprout. The sauce on the sprout however, was on point!!! 

I will definitely come back here but I'm gonna get myself a burger instead. It looked really juicy!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy restaurant with pleasant service by the lake where you can get some sunshine, cocktails, and a few apps for sharing.  

We tried their Pimms cocktail with cucumber, strawberry, ginger ale and mint, really hit the spot on a hot day and I am normally not a fan of drinking from canning jars (please join my club, I'm starting an anti-jar, anti-wooden bowtie club).

The ahi tuna with avocado, sesame oil, soy sauce, and watermelon salad was refreshing and a must-try.

We liked the calamari, it was very tender. The bacon grilled cheese and tomato soup were fine, but the outstanding plates were definitely the ahi tuna, calamari, and the Pimms.

A 25 min drive from Markham, and just a bit north of Stouffville, this is a good option for people who don't want to dive into traffic heading south for a lunch spot with patio that overlooks a parking lot. 

Tip: If you don't like sunshine....don't come here and ask the server to sit you where the sun don't shine.  The point of eating here is to get some partial sun between patio umbrellas, and bask in it. So don't be one of those annoying people who want the luxury of outdoor patio dining but minus the vitamin D. Just put some sunscreen on and bring your hat."}
{"text":"Nice view and nice service! I have tried the shrimp taco, the portion was not that big. The shrimp is like something from a shrimp platter. It's not grilled (at least I thought it was). But the burger was juicy (we got lamb burger) and their fries are awesome!

Having lunch at this price with an amazing view, I think it's worth it! Good for family gathering and weekends chillax! Unfortunately the beach is only opened for residents."}
{"text":"Awesome location! Overall great atmosphere. The wood oven pizzas are delicious. A little on the pricer end but worth it because of the overall ambiance."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing at this outdoor restaurant. It has a great layout and overlooks Musellman lake. We went on a Friday evening and there was a wait as expected, but it wasn't too, too long.

Food: For apps we shared the spiced olives and chips & dip. Both were ok. For mains my friends got pizzas (Pepe's pizza and Spicy Mediterranean) which were tasty but the crusts were charred on both. I got the crab burger, which sounded intriguing, but when I actually ate it, the bun overpowered the flavour of the burger itself. I don't know if I can even call it a burger, it was more of a crabcake on a bun. The fries were good. 

Service was for the most part great. I was a little annoyed when I ordered a Steamwhistle (at the bar before our dinner), and I received a beer with a ton of head. I asked the bartender for less head. She complied but made sure to tell me, \"Just so you know, that's how much head there's supposed to be for Steamwhistle... 3 fingers\". It looked like more than 3 fingers to me... I've been drinking for 10 years, she didn't even look old enough to drink... I've never received a hard time about excessive head before. I don't mind a little, but really? Later during dinner I ordered another one, and again, it had a ton of space at the top. I cut myself off after that because I can't stand paying for a beer and receiving two thirds of one.

Overall I'd return, but probably just for dinner with no drinks. Mosquitos were out when it got a little late, so if you plan to come in the evening remember to cover up."}
