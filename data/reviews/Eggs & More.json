{"text":"Management is horrible, owner was sitting around watching television. It was dirty, the host had to come and get my drinks. The server was described by my kids as emotionless. The food was cold and flavorless. The silverware was dirty as well, the smell around the restaurant was filthy as well it smelled like an old sewer. I would not recommended anyone to come in here. This place is not going to last. From my understanding all of the owners previous restaurants had closed down, this ones not going to be any different so it seems. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HERE, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR."}
{"text":"Always go there when near or take a detour to get my Veggies Benedict with shredded hashbrown!"}
{"text":"Aweful service.  Tables weren't clean. Watched them touch the silverware on the top as they wrapped. Tables were left uncleared for 20 minutes at a time when there was a huge line waiting.  Waited an hour for our food. Never got it. We got up and walked out. Not happy with this place. Would never recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"It's hard to screw up breakfast. But they sure did it. Scrambled eggs were ok. Hash browns were mush. Bacon was burnt on half of the slice and undercooked on the other half. I don't even know how that can happen. And last and certainly least. The toast wasn't even toasted. I'll be amazed if this place is still in business next year"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a guy I follow on Twitter who comes here often. Since I'm always on the lookout for new breakfast places to try, I thought I'd give it a whirl. It's a large, casual restaurant in an area predominantly populated by fast food chain restaurants, grocery stores and big box retailers east of Prairie Winds Park.  We arrived before the 10:00 rush, and were seated quickly. Coffee was poured, wifi password obtained and menu scanned. The usual big breakfast offerings were on the menu as well as lighter fare (ie. oatmeal, etc.). I usually judge breakfast restaurants on the quality of their Eggs Bennie (my favourite, and which was on the menu in a variety of combinations), but was in the mood for an omelette. I ordered the Mushroom and Cheddar Omelette which came with chunky potatoes (freshly cut and seasoned) and choice of toast (white, w/w, rye or sourdough), fruit or perogies. I ordered fruit expecting the usual fruit salad from a tub, and was pleasantly surprised when I was presented with a bowl of freshly cut fruit. My husband ordered one of the protein-heavy breakfast items and rye (marble!) toast. Breakfast arrived hot and promptly. It was very tasty and reasonably priced.  The service was friendly, but they seemed to be a little understaffed for the size of the restaurant. They managed to keep up while we were there, and we were satisfied. However, they were getting busier as we were leaving. I will definitely be adding this to my list of favourite breakfast spots."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite breakfast places. Eggs and more is located in a strip mall just off McKnight in Falconridge, and any food located in a big box strip mall is normally something I'd write off. That and the fact that it reminded me of a refurbished Denny's.  The hostess was efficient, and on top of her game,  and we only waited 5 minutes to be seated, even though the place seemed extremely busy.  The menu was a bit overwhelming. Not only is this a breakfast place but they serve lunch and dinner as well. I settled on the veegtarian eggs benedict, with a side of fruit. The food came out and was a large portion because it automatically comes with hash browns - real ones, not frozen, as well as the option to choose fruit, a pancake or perogies as another side. The eggs benedict had tomato and spinach, as well as broccoli, and I got the hollandaise on the side in case they smother it on like most places. it was a decent hollandaise, as it wasn't that artificial neon yellow you see in some of the cheaper restaurants. The fruit actually included grapes, strawberries, kiwis, banana, pineapple and melon. This also surprised me since I was expected the usual melon and grape combo. All this for $8.45! My friend had a breakfast with two eggs, sausages, ham, perogies, hashbrowns and toast all for just over $10. Again, everything tasted great. The waitresses worked together and we were never without coffee or water. That being said, they were all under 18 and gave better service than most bfast joints I frequent. Super impressed with this place, and will definitely bring others here in the future...maybe this weekend even :)."}
{"text":"My all time favourite place to go for breakfast. I have never had a meal that was not amazing here. The service is prompt, the staff is friendly and the food is great. I recommend checking this one out for those of you who have not already. I have been going for over a year now and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed by breakfast here!  My husband and I decided to go for brunch yesterday (only calling it brunch because we got up and went so late), and I knew I had seen Eggs & More on Yelp before so we checked reviews and we were on our way. A bit of a wait for the food but it was quite busy and I really don't mind waiting for great food! I ordered the Eggs Benedict classic and it was AMAZING! I love that you get 2 sides since most places only serve it with hash browns but I got pancakes as well!  My husband ordered the Hamburger Steak and eggs, served with hash browns and he chose perogies. I tried a bite of the perogies and the hamburger steak together and there was so much flavour!!   Amazing food! Worth any wait you might experience!"}
{"text":"Good portions of food Good service Good food and variety Cheaper and seems more fresh than Denny's and I don't mind Denny's at all. Big tables and booths"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service.  We went for a nice breakfast with friends, took almost 10 minutes to be acknowledged by our waitress, then we ordered our drinks and food all at once since we knew what we wanted...food came out and it was good.  Never got asked if we wanted refills and our drinks where finished right after we got our food.  Waitress just stood at bar talking to other co-workers.  When we asked about why we didn't get refills after WE had to ask for our bill she responded with \"you didn't ask\"...how can you ask when your waitress vanishes?  We asked to speak to the manager and the manager defended the waitress and offered no compensation.  Definitely not a good start to a sunny day!"}
{"text":"Best bennies in town!   Where do I start? My guilty pleasure...Breakfast served fast but really damn tasty! The staff that work here have been here for a long time with very little turnover and the owner is a great guy who is very family oriented and respectful. The Bennies, potatoes, pancakes and peanut butter milkshake are to die for!!! The omelettes are pretty yummy too.. Fluffy, fresh and healthy. Complete with Calgary photos and lots of booths/seating areas this place is great for all meals of the day. Did I mention they have a rewards card? It really pays off to eat here.. Load up on points and before you know it you get $10 off your next meal. Points do not take long to accumulate either! Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"I live real close and usually go for Sunday brunch, which is great. Actually I haven't had any bad food or experiences just a lot of good ones. So glad this restaurant is so close to home for me. They have a loyalty card so when you've spent $100 you get a ten dollar off voucher toward your next dining experience. Open early for breaky also open lunch and dinner. Beware Sunday mornings can be quite busy."}
{"text":"Looking for a place for breakfast this is a great value and pretty good food. The hostess whom sat us seemed to not want to be at work that day, but our server made up for it. Had the steak & eggs and eggs Benny both were delicious and made as requested."}
{"text":"Met with some old friends over brunch on a Saturday morning. This is a solid breakfast joint, and refreshing that one does not have to trek all the way downtown for a good non-chain option (as what seems to be the norm in Calgary). I always have trouble choosing between the savoury and sweet options, and their breakfast combos really work for me: the standard eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns, and the option of pancakes (also the option of fruit) instead of toast (among a number of toast options). Eggs and hashbrowns were decent, bacon crispy, and pancakes nice and fluffy. Coffee is ok - pretty standard diner fare. Well priced for fairly good quality food, unlike the Chez Cora's of the world....  We arrived at around 11am without a reservation and had about a 10 minute wait. It got pretty packed as the day went on. It has a nice, local, diner feel and servers were helpful. It was a little hard to catch their attention at times as it was so busy, but overall the service was fine. I suspect this place will just get busier as more people find out about it so make a reso esp for weekend brunch to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"I usually don't wake up early and get breakfast but today I was specifically craving French toast. I live really near this place and figured by not give it a try. So I did with a friend of mines and wow! They have a really delicious menu. Not just breakfast but also dinner as well. Now I understand the \"N more\" part lol. Loved the French toast and bacon. The sausages were delicious too. Will definitely come back and perhaps bring my mom.  Oh and the waitress had was very kind and pleasing."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have breakfast and read the reviews. We decided to give Eggs & More a try  Somewhat \"worried\" about the coffee we walked into a nice restaurant. Service was great; nothing wrong with the coffee and the Texas Scrambler was tasty.  It is a welcoming place; the charges are reasonable and the food is great. I can recommend a visit."}
{"text":"This was the second time my mom and I went to this restaurant.  First time was grand opening and the wait and and disorganized was unbelievable. So we figured it was do to its just opening. Well we went back today to see if it had gotten any better and I will admit our wait time to be seated was an improvement but once we got a table and then it went down hill from there.  First off no one came to see if we wanted any drinks as we waited the staff seemed to even not notice us at all and went to 5 other tables of guest that came after us. At this point we got frustrated and got up and left.  So my opinion of the place is nkw we will never go back seeing there staff has no value of how to serve there guest"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent - great breakfast and good value for top quality best in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Quality matches with its price. Not the yummiest thing ever, but for a quick and cheap meal that is filling, this place will do the trick."}
{"text":"First time we tried to eat here we walked out. They had wait staff walking out....A real mess! Decided to give it a go one more time. ...should have kept going.....just awful!! Crab cakes were truly awful with the crab cake benedict,  asked for eggs medium....hard as a rock. Food was Luke warm, butter wouldn't melt on my husband's pancake. No excuse for cold food... very few customers.  This place won't make it if they don't straighten up. Very disappointed. ..we REALLY NEED a GOOD breakfast place on the west side.....This ain't it!!!"}
{"text":"We went here last week due to the good reviews it has received.  We enjoyed it so much we went again this week.  We had 3 kids with us and a bonus surprise was that kids eat free on Saturdays (there were 3 adults as well).  Not sure if this is a new promotion since we were there last week and had to pay for the kids.  Basically, food was good,  reasonably priced.  Service was pretty quick  and for a party of 6, we didn't have to wait too long for a table.  It's probably our new breakfast place pick."}
{"text":"Just went there last week and was completely impressed with the breakfast menu. Had several different eggs benedict selections (which is rare in this area) along with many omelettes, etc. Guess maybe they're trying to improve every day since our visit was excellent. The food was REALLY good and the service was excellent! I'm excited to take my husband when he gets back in town!! Hopefully it's consistant..."}
{"text":"Great meals fantastic service and good prices !!!  Will be coming back again and again"}
{"text":"Good price but a dump food on the floor and tables set for new customers not cleaned sticky stuff and hair on the table"}
{"text":"We decided to try this after always seeing only a few cars in the lot. My husband ordered the hungry man plate.. hash browns were mush, bacon and sausage were fine but there was a hair in the eggs. Waitress came back exchanged it for a club sandwich which was ok. My sister in law ordered Philly cheese steak with fries and it also had a hair on it. I ordered the same thing and mine was fine maybe needed a lil more salt.. best thing was the fries.. my brother ordered the steak and eggs and said it was good. The kids' plates were also ok. As I got up my foot fell in a hole! It looked like it used to be a drain  but literally covered it with a thin piece of carpet! We will not be back there. For the price and quality we would've been better at Dennys or Ihop."}
{"text":"I tried their French Toast with fresh fruits topping with whipped cream, it was delicious ! Coffee was good too and service was very nice. I would defiantly come back"}
{"text":"I used the app to see what brunch places were near me, I chose this place after seeing other reviews and the rating. The meat lovers benedict was really good and very reasonable prices! It was fairly busy for a Tuesday afternoon, I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Great value!  Great start to my Calgary trip!  Pancakes were a possible substitute for the toast."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time this morning.  I was immediately impressed by the decor - not because it was especially fancy, but rather because it was comfortable and simple. At 10:30am on a Sunday morning, there was a steady stream of people arriving but we were seated immediately.  Our waitress was friendly and quick, and checked back on us after being served. As for the food.. Great.  Nothing too fancy, but it doesn't need to be.  My wife ordered an omelet with a side of pancakes and coffee, and I went with the Pancake Sandwich with tea.  The pancakes were good, unlike most restaurants that seem to somehow manage to leave the insides mushy while burning the outside.  Bacon was perfectly cooked, as were the eggs.  My wife said her breakfast was fantastic as well, though she thought the coffee was a little weak.  However, she said it was good last time, so maybe someone just missed a scoop of coffee or something.  No big deal.  If all else fails, they offer a bunch of specialty coffees as well. The best part of the meal?  The bill.  Under $30. We took a look at the lunch and dinner menus, and we're definitely thinking about coming back and trying a different part of the menu.  If you haven't tried them out yet, just go!"}
{"text":"Eggs & More used to be my absolute favourite breakfast place so when I visited today for brunch I was admittedly disappointed with everything.  I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict, but what I received was thinly sliced, microwaved, not smoked, salmon. After one bite I had to promptly remove it and the mound of wilting spinach as the overwhelming fishy taste was way too much to pallet. It was disgusting to say the least.  My partner ordered the chicken mushroom Swiss burger and was pretty underwhelmed with the slimy and flavourless chicken.  (The coffee can still burn a hole through your stomach though if your wondering) Mostly we could have done without the waitresses sat behind us counting their tips and negatively discussing their least favourite customers of the day.  Overall just a super uncomfortable, unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice--both times the food and service was excellent.  The first time, Jason, was also training a new person.  He, and she, were professional and efficient.  My husband had a question about how the prime rib was cooked--He like his well-done.  Jason went into the kitchen and the chef/owner came out with a piece of it to that Ken could try it before ordering--good customer service.  I had the crab benedict and the crab cake was as good as Ruby Tuesday's.  The second time I had the Reuben--the best one I have had.  My husband had the ham steak and eggs over easy.  Perfection.    It's hard to believe that the 3 previous reviews and I had frequented the same place."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and they have lots of forgotten things like a Monte Cristo sandwich. The service can be a little bit or miss but the food will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Zero stars. Didn't eat here cause after standing by hostess station for 15 minutes, decided to leave. The waitresses saw us, but never even acknowledged us - the 6 tables they were serving must've been too much to handle as it was. There were a few other people who walked in and waited behind us. They too left.   My prediction is this place will not last unless they up their service!"}
{"text":"We were at a loss yesterday to have breakfast.  We didn't want to go to IHOP, Crackerbarrel or Black Bear Diner.  I remembered that this place had just opened.    We walked in after noticing a full parking lot.  A smiling face greeted us and seated us without a wait. Our drink order was taken quickly and followed by our food order.  I don't think we waited more than 10 minutes for our food to arrive.  The food was good and prepared to order.  The place was clean and efficient.  My wife and I spent about 45 minutes eating and watching people come in and out.  By the time we left the entire place was full and there is a good reason for it.  Our bill was $18 and some change.  I think it was a very good value.  They have quite a few items on the menu for lunch and dinner.  I am sure we will be back to give it a try."}
{"text":"The place was only open a couple of months, the owners pulled the plug and now it is closed. If you are going to open a business, at least keep it open for a while, morons. Gees."}
{"text":"It took over 45 minutes for the food to come out.  I ordered the chicken fried chicken.  The chicken was so rubbery and the crust was soggy.  My eggs were over done and the toast was burnt. Will never go there again for breakfast."}
{"text":"I echo the good value for Calgary, mentioned by another yelper. The entrees I've had (mostly breakfast, but a couple good burgers too) have been great. Typically good, responsive service. Has a local diner feel. Overall? Great place for breakfast and lunch in the NE."}
{"text":"Working in Calgary staying at a hotel by the airport. Had breakfast at Eggs & More twice this week and was great. First day had the eggs benedict. Awesome and fast. The second visit was the standard eggs and your choice of meat and toast. Awesome and fast. It's a great place if your in the NE airport area. Yes I've found my new breakfast place in Calgary."}
{"text":"Good value for Calgary. My meal was comparable to Cora's, for less! I had the French toast with fruit. 3 perfectly cooked pieces of french toast (crispy on the outside, moist on the inside), and the fruit was fresh and tasty, and not just a piece of cantaloupe and a couple grapes - there were oranges, pineapple, kiwi, strawberry, and of course, cantaloupe, honeydew and grapes."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is nice and hard working, but they are way understaffed for this area. Food was good, but not great. Maybe we'll try again in a few months."}
{"text":"We decided to try Eggs and more, we had a coupon but forgot to present it when we ordered, the coupon does say to present when ordering but the waitress was really nice and said that she would get the boss to override the check so she could accept it. I could not believe how rude the boss was, he came out to the table and made a scene and ruined our appetite. We will never go back and we will bad mouth this so called resturant to everyone we know. The food was terrible, the only thing that was good about this place was the waitress."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. The place was clean and bright. Unfortunately, it was also nearly empty. Our server, Chrissy, appeared quickly for beverage orders and gave us plenty of time to study the menu, which is extensive with something to satisfy everyone.    My wife's tuna melt was big enough for 2, piled high with fresh, homemade tuna, sliced pickles, and melted swiss. The real treat was the generous stack of housemade potato chips on the side. My breakfast quesadilla was stuffed full of cheese and veggies.  The tortilla was nicely grilled. The sour cream and salsa accompaniments were a nice finish.   We'll definitely be going back and telling others looking for good food and fair prices."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service.  Good prices Loved the Eggs and more Omelette with French Toast! Will definitely go back if I am close."}
{"text":"I am not surprised that this place is closed and the locks have been changed.  Food was awful.  Service was awful.  There is nothing good that I could say about this place.  Maybe if the owner had every been present instead of worrying about opening a new restaurant,  he would have had more control."}
{"text":"We were seated pretty quickly even though it was busy. Served as coffee as soon as we were on our table. Staff are nice and helpful, always asking if we need anything else or if we're good. The food came pretty fast too. Prices are reasonable. Their steak and spaghetti were pretty plain but everything else were good."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the outside.  It it fantastic inside.   Nice long private booths.   Great food.   Nice staff.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the area. In an area with significant culinary diversity, it's a great American/Canadian breakfast place. The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. My concern is a recent (last three months) concern of cleanliness. My last 5 or so visits always results in sending cutlery, cups and plates back as they are dirty. Tables are not always clean and the menus are often smeared with foodstuff.. That's the only thing they need to work on. other than that, I am a super fan."}
{"text":"Decided to try this breakfast place. Bad idea. We always go somewhere else but they were crowded. Walked in to eggs n more and there were about 3 groups ahead of us. The restaurant was empty but they did not seat us. After waiting about 15 minutes they sat us and it took over and hour to get our food. This place needs staff and a better manager. EXCUSES!! Horrible. Will not return."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The staff was very attentive and kept giving us refills. I got the veggie omlette and it was delicious. The only thing I would change is the potatoes served with each breakfast. It could be slightly better."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast option this side of the tracks.  My dad, sister, and I arrived for Saturday brunch and were seated immediately in the largest booth I may have ever sat at.  I felt tiny.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive (which can be a chore between the high maintenance requests of my dad and sister).  The veggie omelette and roasted potatoes were pretty good.  I opted for a side of fruit which was surprisingly very fresh and with excellent variety.  My sister was very happy with her club sandwich, but my dad was not overly impressed with his steak, which he found tough, but said that the shrimp was excellent.  Overall very decent and a much preferred alternative to Denny's or the like."}
{"text":"We've been coming here often the last 3 years.  Very good food for the most part and the servers are quite polite and quick.  Prices are respectable.  The eggs Benny is decent however they have to improve on the hollandaise sauce.  It tastes very weak and diluted.  I find many people judge a breakfast restaurant by their bennies and the ones here could be improved a lot by better sauce."}
{"text":"Hostess saw us & made us wait for no  reason.  Food was ok.  Waitress was great!  Order came  out wrong but was corrected super fast."}
{"text":"I really wish that I could write a glowing review about Eggs and More BUT we waited in the lobby for 15 minutes to be seated (no hostess). Each of the 2 wait staff told us we will be with you in just a minute. They were taking care of a handful of customers, maybe 6-10 each. After waiting 15 minutes in a less than busy restaurant we left to go to a place that would actually seat and serve us. It will be a long time until we try this place again!!!!!"}
{"text":"One word: Delicious!  If you're looking for a good all day breakfast joint in the NE, then look no further! I've been here on numerous occasions and each time the food was delicious! I always get the Eggs plus combo with 4 slices for Turkey Bacon, Banana-chocolate chip pancakes and roasted potatoes...the pancakes are a must!! I've tried the Egg's benny a couple of times and both times it was pretty good - the hollandaise sauce has a bit of a kick to it, which is a nice surprise  I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because the last time I went there they ran out of bananas...boggles the mind  I highly recommend you check this place out, but stay away from the steak and eggs..the steak is pretty weak...but I guess thats why its called EGGS and more, and not Steak and more"}
{"text":"I tired The chef's special AAA sirloin steak and it's especially good. Love the melted cheese, the seasonings is perfect , steak lean and thin, came out hot and fresh. The medium pouched eggs were spectacular too. Amount of food is not bad, fills one person. Price is better than downtown brunches. Service is fast too. Well done for a neighbourhood brunch restaurant."}
{"text":"Great breakfast near the airport. Both the classic eggs Benedict and French toast were excellent."}
{"text":"No one greeted us when we walked in. Then one of the girls waived at us to follow her to a table. Our waitress came over after a bit of a wait and was apologetic for the delay. The food was decent but took to long. Short staffed perhaps?   We were looking for a nice place for Sunday brunch and are still looking..."}
{"text":"Super fast service! I am so glad you all opened:-) The spinach feta omelette was awesome! Good luck!"}
{"text":"My husband have the steak and eggs the steak was season very well I had the build your own breakfast with pancakes bacon and shredded hashbrowns it was very good the eggs are dark oak which I like the coffee is good so I would recommend it Service is really good not too busy lots of seating clean bathrooms, Eggs Benedict is great comes with hash browns and your choice of pancake, toast, or fruit! Eggs have dark yolk which I love!! Coffee is good. Service is fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Very affordable and delicious.  Best breakfast place in Calgary.  Blows Dairy lane and others out of the water and makes you feel welcome!  French toast sandwich is awesome but eggs benedict was a close 2nd."}
{"text":"so yummy! really cute and service was friendly. the deep fried potatoes are to die for they are soooo good! & for the price it's a pretty good portion!"}
{"text":"Glad a new restaurant opened in this somewhat rundown/discount part of Goodyear. Other reviews were accurate - friendly greeting, fast service and food cooked to order.  They do have free wi-fi, which hasn't been mentioned.  My only complaints are these:  At 10am, the east facing windows are super hot. Shades would be nice or turn down the A/C. This is especially true of the sun heated creamers on the table.  Your food is a bit expensive for the no nonsense decor. $8.99 for a pancake/waffle/french toast combo with 2 eggs and 2 sausage and 2 bacon seemed a bit much. If I'd gotten thick applewood smoked bacon or something more than previously frozen sausage, maybe I'd think better of the price - but the ingredients are Denny's average.  I'd spruce up the decor a bit. It looks like you opened up the old JB's and fired up the stove.  I'll give it another try, but right now I'd rank this along other offerings in the area for average breakfast offerings."}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is friendly, food is wonderful, and the prices are cheap. Their French toast and crispy bacon is to die for! I have never been disappointed by any of the food I have tried here. Weekends can be busy but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Best place to get breakfast this side of down town! Great service! amazing food!  I love the milk shakes. Wifey loves the Italian sodas! Perfect for the family to"}
{"text":"Deep in the NE, there's a former Asian restaurant that has transformed itself into a pretty decent breakfast and lunch place.  Not unlike the (to me) overhyped Cora (sorry Cora, but I've eaten at Chez Cora's in Montreal including the original...buuut...).    Pluses: - eggs were decent - bacon was definately crispy - thank god it's actual sausages and not the el cheapo type - a heck of a lot of choices for toast - A huge breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, pancakes, hash browns and coffee was under $10!  Negatives: - pancakes were ok - coffee could be stronger - they put fruit on the plate (I so hate the Cora style)  Basically it's a pretty nice, spot for an inexpensive, plentiful morning nosh, but a bit cursed by the location.  The service was reasonably attentive, there's a nice choice of newspapers to peruse while waiting, and the booths are plush and comfy.  Honestly, it really needs some more exposure as it really deserves to be a heck of a lot busier.  It's not a place I would go to regularly as it's just way too far out from the downtown core for me to go to, but for the locals and those working in the NE, it's worth the trip.  #3 of Yelp 100 Challenge"}
{"text":"A pretty good place for all day breakfast.  The food is decent and the staff are friendly enough.  This place would get 4 stars if they would update their online menu.  I hasn't been updated and we were expecting prices to be less expensive.  We were surprised when we got the bills."}
{"text":"This is my regular place to go to on Sundays for brunch and I just love quaint businesses that still care about good family service and quality food that you can taste the TLC. The service is great, the waitresses aren't obnoxious, they're sweet and helpful. The food reminds me of mom's home cooking and most dishes are under $10.00. The ambience is homely and I love that you can come in PJ's and no one will give you judging looks. You can also sign up for an Eggs & More bucks card and you save money in the long run if you regularly eat there. A definite deserved 5 stars, I highly recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would. First, they don't have a kids menu. A 4 year old cannot eat an adult meal! We ordered the ultimate omelette: egg, bacon, sausage, ham, onion, peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese. The meal came with hashbrowns and toast. We ordered the omelette without peppers and tomatoes. When the waitress brought the food the omelette was no more than 1/2 inch thick. No fluffiness, dry, over cooked and they forgot the onions and mushrooms. It was horrible! The hashbrowns were cold and the toast wasn't even good. This was about 4pm on a Friday and we were the only people there besides the wait staff. We sat right across from where the waitresses bring the food from the kitchen. The owner calls all the staff to the food pick up area for what I  assuming is a staff meeting. He is talking loud enough that we hear every word he says. As he talks to them he starts telling them about how in years past he smoked pot and did cocaine. I can not believe what we are hearing, nor can I imagine any circumstance where this shod be told to the staff. If you want your employees and customers to respect you, leave your private life private. When the waitress brought our check I asked her if that man doing the talking was the boss. She said yes and started laughing. I told her the whole conversation was inappropriate, she agreed and apologized. You know what, I could care less, from what I saw and had to eat I will bet this place is closed in less than year. We will not return!"}
{"text":"Eggs & More is my family's go to Sunday breakfast place because the food is always quality and fresh and the price can't be beat.  And that is why I have given then 4 stars for the food. I will say though, that lately the teenage staff he's been hiring have not been upholding an acceptable level of customer service. They seem bored, and disinterested. I know serving isn't the best job out there but the last thing you want to do is make your customers feel unwelcome and like they are an Inconvenience."}
{"text":"I arrived at about 2:30 PM. As I got out of my car, I saw a male employee lock the door and run back inside the restaurant, obviously hoping that I wouldn't see him. Even though there were only two other cars in the parking lot, there were no obvious signs suggesting they were closed. I was determined to try a new mom & pop eatery, so walked to the entrance and tried opening the front door, just in case... It would not budge. No employee had the courtesy to tell me why they locked their door and they had no signs indicating why they were closed. A simple \"sorry, we were slow, so we decided to call it a day\" would have sufficed, but I guess that's too much to ask.  Given the semi-obscure location of this restaurant, in a shopping center with a vacant anchor tenant, I would think they would be eager to take all the business they can get. Perhaps this attitude mirrors the service I would have received (or lack, thereof) had I been let in. I never had a chance to taste their food, so I'll have to assume that its quality reflects their poor attitude. I can't justify giving them a rating above one star. It looks like my breakfast choices in Goodyear will continue to remain north of I-10.  I wouldn't be surprised if this place closes permanently by the end of 2014."}
{"text":"Excellent food and selection for breakfast and lunch! Beats dirty Denny's and roughed up Ricky's! Great prices and excellent service! Would recommend to anyone in the area looking for a different restaurant to try."}
{"text":"Very clean. My fave place to get some FANTASTIC home made brekkie. Always SO good. Pancakes are on point! Large servings. I have nothing more to say but  perfect. Quiet, good service. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Why 3 stars?  1) I went with my friend who is minority as well. He was treated really bad lots of attitude from the girl at the til which was uncalled for. 2) service was good.  3) food is average its nothing special  4) very busy....it seems like they don't have enough staff. It took at least 5 mins to get empty tables. 5) the food portion is OK. Nothing special either. The fruits are fresh and pretty sweet. 6) only got a refill of coffee. Considering... 7) its pretty busy we went at around 9a.m.  The menu is pretty good variety. Not your usual stuff..I'm not a big breakfast person but its pretty good got pancakes eggs bacon sausage I can't remember if there's waffles. Fresh fruits.  The price is reasonable. For 2 of us it cost 25 bucks. Service was good otherwise. Knocked off 2 stars because I know when we are being frowned upon because of our color. Just being real..."}
