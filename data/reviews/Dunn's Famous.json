{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the other day. Had not been in awhile and it may be awhile before I go back. The menu is extensive, but stuck with a classic smoke meat platter, medium, which had more fat than I expected and with the rest it was just ok. The pickle was the best part. Two platters one beer almost 50$  Service was poor as they only returned at the end of our meal as they were busy tending to signage. I could go into this more but won't."}
{"text":"If you are craving for smoked meat and this is the only place to go, then by all mean. if not, the food  is not worth the price.   went with a friend for a late lunch. the place is almost empty. had a roast beef and smoked meat club. i have never had this type of sandwich before so i am not an expert. the bread wasn't toasted and we asked the server if we can get it toasted. after a few min of explaining why they can't do it because of the lettuce and tomato, he took our food back to the kitchen.   our sandwich came back with the the top lightly toasted and everything else remain the same... i appreciated the effort but if you are going to do it, might as well toast the other side of the bread?  overall, the food as a-OK. fries tasted like they have been sitting for a little bit and the coleslaw wasn't the best either.  i hope the real dunn's famous in Montreal live up to its name!"}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich I had was excellent, it was basically like a corned beef sandwich if you are unfamiliar. Also the french onion soup I had the next day was good too. Lots and lots of gruyere!  The place was just kind of dark and greasy though. The general ambiance kind of depressed me. Would love one of those sandwiches right now though..."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for smoked meat. However, for the price I paid, I was expecting just a bit more. I ordered the smoked meat and chicken sandwich combination. The smoked meat was a bit dry. The stuffed chicken was still cold (as if someone had just pulled out of a fridge). Fries were great though (hot, fresh, and ample amounts). The coleslaw and pickle were good (nothing special). Portion wise, I was expecting a bit more smoked meat. Service was a bit slow at times (long wait to get seated and ordering, but quick for the food and bill). The bathroom is a disaster (couldn't even find soap), and the decor is getting old (tape over couches, and a layer of dirt and grime on the tables. Overall, if you're looking for a place to get smoked meat (or any food for that matter; the menu is huge) in the middle of the night (after a night out; this place is opened 24 hours), this is not a bad option. If you are looking for good quality smoked meat, this is not your place. In fact, try the Dunn's in the west island. I found that one has better smoked meat and better service all together."}
{"text":"Went downtown to go to a few stores and was in the mood for a place that serves brunch. Walked past here, had a look at the menu and decided this place seemed to fit the bill.  The decor is like a sports type bar and there were a lot of empty tables to sit down. There was really bad cheesy music playing which was rather annoying. I ordered the Mariner Eggs Benedict which came with a choice of bagel or English muffin. I decided on the the whole wheat bagel. My companion had the reuben sandwich. The food arrived promptly and was luke warm. I found the portion size adequate but the bagel was dry and tasted a bit stale. The rest of the meal was adequate.  My companion remarked on the meat in the reuben sandwich saying it was pretty good but the sandwich needed sauce. He really likes his reuben sandwiches so I guess this was adequate for him.  The server was quick and efficient and with 2 x fruit juices, the bill came to $40. We both felt this was too expensive for the quality of the food but that's what you get eating out in the theater district.   They claim to be famous for their food but I'm not sure what exactly prompted them to claim this title. Definitely won't be going back again as I'm sure there are much better places to eat a good quality brunch."}
{"text":"Great food, cocktails, and service. Smoked meat excellent though not quite the best. The Med salad was just what I was looking for.  Music also great."}
{"text":"Just came back and will never return....STAY AWAY  1. Roof leaking and dripping on nearby tables - warning number 1 2. Floor sticky and looking like they have not been mopped for some time - warning 2 3. Fly in salad unfortunately found half way through. Apologies from wait staff, no manager to be found, offer of a free desert. 4. Soggy paper in pasta found in first few bites  Needless to say, we left. Again, no Manager to be found, just a dirty, filthy restaurant.Will NOT come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner while visiting Montreal. As my wife was not feeling well, we cancelled plans to find crepes and I took the kids to the nearest restaurant that would be kids friendly. We stayed at the Hilton Bonaventure, so it was only about a  8 minute walk.  While it was pretty jammed for 8 p.m. on a Friday night, they managed to sit us in 5 minutes, which is great if you have kids that are hungry.  While the Cesear salad arrive quickly, our dinners probably took at least 10 more minutes after we finished the salad. The salad was average, but I did find it odd that they used that weird fake bacon. I mean, isn't this a meat-lovers haven?  The super sized sandwich is BIG. I could barely find the bread to hold the thing together. The taste was pretty good, but I found it a slight bit drier than other places. The coleslaw was a disappointment, which for me is really important. Hardly any taste at all.  The kids were happy enough with their hot dog and spaghetti. Overall, a pretty safe bet for a family with kids if you can't find better options."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here and the service is always great.  This time I had the basic smoked meat platter and it didn't disappoint.  The meat was awesome - exactly what I was hoping for. A great place for kids, too."}
{"text":"We pasted through here on a Thursday lunch hour.  The restaurant was quite empty. We ordered the soup and famous smoked meat sandwich.  The smoke meat was fabulous.  The soup came in a huge 2-3 cup sized bowl.  The chicken noodle soup did not have much chicken flavor and seemed watered down.  My ginger ale was flat and the server replaced my drink with a can promptly.  We have been to the Decarie location and the food seems to be better there."}
{"text":"Contrary to Jenny's review I think this place has the best pizza ever. I had it on 3 separate occasions. It is thin but oh so delicious. I can not speak for the smoked meat pizza as I have not tried it. Pepperoni, all dressed or vegetarian = awesome. I could eat the whole thing by myself it's so good :)"}
{"text":"Worst deli I have ever been to!!! The place is large, but when I arrived a 1:30pm, it was empty (should have taken that as a sign). I am a sucker for good chopped liver, so I decided on the Dunn's Favorite (triple decker with chopped liver & fried onions on the bottom layer and egg salad on the top layer). I had to remove the crust on the bread since it was so \"rubbery\" I couldn't bite through it. There was about 2 tablespoons of chopped liver and even less egg salad. The chopped liver tasted old and had an unusual color, the fried onions were burnt and oily (I tasted them for at least 24 hours and no toothpaste or gum could eliminate), the egg salad had no seasoning. The meal came with fries, pickle, and cole slaw. I  tasted the cole slaw - Not Good, and decided against trying the pickle since I had more sightseeing to do and didn't want to have an unfortunate accident!  I complained to my server about the sandwich, and was told that some people like it and some people don't. Never assumed there may be something wrong with it or asked if I wanted something else. Gave me the bill for my $12.95 sandwich, I paid it, and left with the knowledge I would write a review.  Dunn's Famous is overpriced, lacks customer service, puts out terrible food, and should be accused of fraud for calling itself a deli!"}
{"text":"It's hard to give this a fair review since I'm a pescatarian, however, I thought the Matzoh Ball Soup was a bit crumbly, while the Latkas were too greasy and could've been crisper"}
{"text":"Really good smoked meat and the restaurant has a fun and unpretentious vibe. The fries were juicy and crispy, make sure you cover them in vinegar like a true Quebecer. There was so much smoked meat in the sandwich it was falling out. I opted for medium meat and man did it hit the spot. Just the right amount of fat and tenderness. Yum! I found the service to be warm, helpful and prompt. Maybe they've changed their staff since all the complaints here? My only complaint is that they didn't have any fancy mustard just the normal kind. It may not have the same legendary reputation as Shwartz's but it's still top notch. Recommended if you're close by."}
{"text":"Horrendous. How can a specialized smoked meat restaurant not have anyone in the kitchen who knows how to cut it correctly??? Second time in a row i go there and ordered lean smoked meat and what i got both times was 20% chunks of fat and part was even cut along the grain. The wait staff even admitted they get complaints all the time...   I most certainly will never be going back as they clearly have no care or consideration for quality control. Thats all im gonna waste my time saying."}
{"text":"Very good dried meat. Poutines are good. Service was friendly and efficient. Place is spotless. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Smoked brisket sandwich, coleslaw, and pouting were very good, burger was good, buffalo wrap very good. Server was kind, made good suggestions, and replenished sofas frequently. Nice experience just off Rue St. Catherine near shopping and hotels."}
{"text":"J'aime ce resto familial! Notre famille adore la poutine parisienne avec du smoke meat!! Mmm le service est bon aussi"}
{"text":"Great food.  Good job with the smoked meat. Their fries are excellent as well.  They have TVs all over the place for watching sports."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I had the best sandwich ever! More than once. My wife had a whisky , chilli poutine that was to die for."}
{"text":"After work, starving and need to eat something before watching Rock of Ages, which was an amazing production by the way. If you missed it, too bad so sad haha  Now back to the Dunn's. Nice establishment, friendly staff, Montreal's Original right?? Gotta be fantasic right? Not so much. May I expected too much from the name?  The sandwichs were good, they spaghetti with smoked meat was decent enough. Nothing gave me that \"DaYam, this is the ISH\"   Not a place that I would go out of my way for, but if I was in the area for a show. I'd definitely stop in and have my meal here.  You all have heard me say this before, once you go commercial, you become a cookie cutter."}
{"text":"Advised to go here and told it was Allergy Friendly. Upon ordering a Gluten Free Meal, I was advised they don't do Gluten Free. I have multiple food Allergies, a couple life threatening, so have to be really careful with what I eat. I ordered a Bun Less Burger and Fries. We had to wait quite a while to get it. 3 Couples who came in and ordered after us, had their food arrive before we got ours. Once it finally arrived, I found the Fries were over cooked and the meat patty under cooked. Where I come from it looked raw in the middle! I won't be going back to any of their Stores again as this experience has put me off them."}
{"text":"was visiting Montreal and went to the downtown location. So good I made sure I made a second visit. Best two meals I ate in Montreal. The smoked meat is HEAVENLY!! It is SOOO good - perfect flavor and texture. I tried my first plate of poutine, and that was good too. A must visit in Montreal!"}
{"text":"You don't go for the ambience, which is dated but somehow appropriate for this iconic establishment. Been here many times and you can never go wrong with the traditional smoked meat sandwich."}
{"text":"While I was in Montreal, I wanted to experience smoked meat and poutine.  I decided to order the Dunn's special which combines both.  It was okay, nothing special.  I don't think everyone would love this. It was very heavy and I definitely felt unwell after.  I'd skip this place if I was local or tourist."}
{"text":"Get off plane...head to Dunn's...then head over to see the family. Been going here since I was a tot. Last time I was here got my photo with a Senater/Former Habs coach...what more could you ask for when you fly in! Huge portions. That includes the cheese cake (in comparison to cheese cake I get served in restos out here in western Canada). Yearly stop for my family (still back in Montreal). I miss you, Dunn's, nearly as much as I miss Montreal. With love, Lina"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant late at night to try the poutine and the smoked meat sandwich.  I was sucked in by all the rave reviews that I felt that there was no alternative to Dunn's for late night poutine.    Needless to say, it wasn't very outstanding.  I've never tried poutine, but I imagine this to be a standard fare.  The smoked meat sandwich was unremarkable as well.  I left the restaurant feeling greasy and with an unsettled stomach.  Next time, I'm trying Reuben's."}
{"text":"Dunn's, our go-to place for smoked meat... Maybe not so much anymore. We went on Valentine's Day and as usual, ordered the super smoked meat platter that costs about 18.00. Not long ago, some of the meat in the sandwich had to be removed and eaten with a fork because there was just too much of it and no mouth is that big! Alas, not so on our last visit. No problem biting into that sandwich, meat and all. How disappointing. Still, what little there was of it was good, as were the fries, cole slaw and  dill pickle. We have never had a problem with the service; it's always been friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Quite a nice place to get smoked meat in downtown MTL at any time of the day, although it's not one of the best in the city. It's also a bit more expensive than other similar restaurants in MTL but it's open 24h so that's definitely a plus"}
{"text":"The classic club is quite a delight as is the classic, the smoked meat. The club is made with the same fresh bread as the smoked meat. The club sandwich itself was a bit dry but a little mayo does the trick. Definitely try this spot out!!! Solo style hater!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was dead when we arrived 9AM on Monday.   But like the Dunn's in Ottawa this place serves breakfast food 24/7 and the portions are big, two of us ate from omelet order.  Atmosphere was great and since they weren't that busy service was excellent."}
{"text":"I've tried them all. Rubins, Schwartz's, Snowden's, etc.  This is where I go now.  The meat is just right. What else is there to talk about? The lines? The soda?  It's not important when it comes to the meat.  Turn the fries into Poutine and enjoy two Montréal classics in one sitting."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious smoked meat sandwich.  Unfortunately I couldn't get it this time around because they say to avoid deli meats while pregnant so I got chicken tenders and fries, which were also pretty decent.  This is one of my Dad's favourite spots to hit when he comes into town and I have to say I was extremely jealous of his smoked meat sandwich.  I will definitely be coming back for one as soon as I am able.     Prices are a little high, but service is friendly and the restaurant is clean and spacious. No complaints overall."}
{"text":"Huge menu with great food  Had the matzo ball soup and the smoked meat sandwich.  Good stuff"}
{"text":"I took my wife and our two boys here for a taste of classic Montreal. Everybody was really pleased with their meals. The portions were generous --- especially the kids meals. They were both large enough to satisfy any adult.  I had the classic smoked meat sandwich with poutine on the side. The smoked meat was really good but not the best I ever had. The poutine was decadent with lots of real cheese curds and fresh cut fries. I couldn't finish it despite how much I liked it.  Prices were very reasonable with the adult meals in the $12 to $16 range and the kids meals at $5.95. Great family spot."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to write home about. I'd go to Nickels around the corner and order the La Star meal deal instead. You could also hit a Canadian Costco food court and buy a Dunn's smoked meat sandwich a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"We had a great time here! Our server was so nice to us and the food was amazing. Some people complain that the poutine gets soggy but I think that was a great thing. It tasted good just like that! I drove all the way back to New York with leftovers from this place and they were still great which is saying something because I hate leftovers. Anyways, loved this place and its sporty Canadian vibe !"}
{"text":"Ate here last night. Have to say I was disappointed. We were seated right away but dinner took a while to arrive (30 min), which should not be the case for a restaurant of this style, in my view.  Food was ok, not super.  I had the smoked meat bagel.  It was acceptable but wouldn't seek it out again.  Experience was ruined by a chain-smoking lard ass on the patio table beside us.  Waiters didn't deal with the guy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere here. The food was great, I had a Smoked Meat Sandwich on a bagel. The booths and tables at the bar give this place a nice diner feel. The menu has tons to offer as well. Great choice for eats in downtown Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"Straight and to the point --- Totally delicious smoked meat sandwich. Don't care if its not the best rated by the connoisseurs of smoked meat. All you need to know is that its delicious and that matters more than the slight nuance of flavor differentiation the connoisseurs will bicker about. Nice atmosphere, huge portions and good wait staff even when it was busy. I went there twice during my 4 day trip!"}
{"text":"Great place. Reminds me of the original Dunn's in Montreal. Plain food, noting fancy, but done well. The smirked meat is great."}
{"text":"Crazy fast service! We ordered and had everything within 5 minutes at 6pm on a Sat night. You can find smoked meat on pretty much everything in their menu. We had Caesars with pulled pork egg roll, pickle, and cucumber. We got the small smoked meat sandwich and I upgraded to poutine. It was huge! The bread for the sandwiches is terrible and the meat is ok. I ended up putting it on my poutine. Gravy is decent and the only thing that makes the fries tasty, but there are better places here and in Toronto (Lakeview). Our server was great though. He gets five stars.  Overall: 3.5"}
{"text":"Places that are open around the clock rock!!  You can't beat grabbing a good bite after a hard night of partying, and you can't beat their scrumptious potato pancakes, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, generously dipped in sour cream. There's just nothing like them ;)"}
{"text":"This Dunn's Famous restaurant is roomier than their Montreal downtown location and has free parking of course. My smoked meat club was tasty because I ordered medium-fat, their sandwich and fries portion size was perfect for me. It is hard to argue in their favor for value when Deli George's which is located right next serves slightly more generous smoked meat and fries dishes at lower price. However, Dunn's Famous do have better seats in a nice retro décor and a wider menu selection including desserts; so if you do plan to sit and chat longer, rather than just stuff yourself with smoked meat, this could be more suitable to you."}
{"text":"I had their Reuben sandwich which was alright but did not enjoy their fries as much. The meat was more medium than fat thus a little on the dry side (I ordered medium-fat). Overall it was fine for smoked meat fix but expensive for the food and service level, as there are plenty others deli smoked meat alternatives in Montreal. The restaurant has a small outdoor seating area at the front but this is a busy street with many pedestrians and cars passing by."}
{"text":"A common thread I've seen in the reviews I've read about most Montreal restaurants is that food quality may vary, but service is almost universally poor. I'm happy to report that I got both great food and good service at Dunns.  Based on what fellow Yelpers recommended, I tried the smoked meat sandwich and poutine. The sandwich was delicious. The sides were top-notch. The poutine was among the best I've had in Montreal. The portions were big and the quality didn't suffer for it.  The service was prompt, helpful, and friendly.   Beginning to end, a good experience."}
{"text":"Looking for your late night smoked meat fix downtown Montreal - look no further to Dunn on Metcalfe street.  They serve a hearty smoked meat sandwich and you can upgrade your fries to a mound of poutine of your choice.  What a filling meal!  They also accept credit card which is a plus.    I would highly recommend this place if you are avoiding lineups at other smoked meat places. :)"}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday afternoon and got seated by a kind woman but our server was a joke. While taking our orders he was leaning up against the wall and acting like he didn't care about his job. While we were eating the two male servers were arguing loudly with a female server about how little they make in tips and she shouldn't be seating everyone and so on.. Mind you, these two guys were outside the front door, on a cigarette break when I was entering the establishment. After seeing how rude the male servers were to this woman and after seeing the lack of shits given about his job, I left our joke of a server a small tip and left. The food was okay. So many better food choices around the area where the servers actually take care of their customers."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I love smoked meat. Hot, freshly carved smoked meat (not the cold thinly sliced kind that you find in supermarkets). I also love my smoked meat thickly cut and medium fatty. Lean meat does not go with smoked meat. (You're thinking turkey or chicken - if lean meat is what you want.)  Ok, so being from Montreal my standards for smoked meat are high :)  Now I know the \"best\" smoked meat in town is a topic of discussion (like our bagels lol) - but I'm Team Schwartz's! Yes, it's not the friendliest nor the fastest service - and there's always a line-up (unless you go really late at night, which I highly recommend btw, great vibe with the staff!). BUT they know how to make their smoked meat!!  And when I'm either too far or too lazy to get to Schwartz's, my go-to place is Dunn's! Their smoked meat is satisfying - and has a nice fatty, marbling texture to it. Their fries are super crispy and good! And I enjoy their coleslaw and pickle too (and always get a Cott's Black Cherry soda).   Again, like with Schwartz's - Dunn's isn't fancy. But they make a yummy smoked meat!"}
{"text":"Great for what it is. A 24/7 deli/diner. Smoked brisket is perfection. Very tender, very lean, no grizzle to chew on and get stuck in your teeth.I like this style of prep much better than Irish corn beef. Friendly service, ample portions."}
{"text":"Located in the Latin quarter. Closest Metro is Peel. Street parking. Waiters/waitresses are perfectly bilingual.  Their smoked meat sandwich is a must when visiting the city. They come in degrees of fattiness. They always recommend medium fat, but I personally prefers extra lean.  Their price is always gone up though, everytime we come to visit. But they don't skimp on their meat. Matzo ball soup is also tasty but small."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Dunn's so my review won't be this specific location but probably more of Dunn's as a whole chain. It's a great place to go late night and its cheap that's its selling point and what is has going for it. the beer is very limited they have a large menu. The sandwich I got was good for a late night cheap place if I would have received this sandwich at a 4* restaurant I would be upset but the sandwich was basic and tasty, a little slimy but is to be expected. the atmosphere was good and the servers were very nice. So overall Dunn's was okay."}
{"text":"I went here two times during my week in Montreal.  The first time I ordered the smoked meat sandwich and poutine.  The sandwich was rather bland, nothing to write home over, but the poutine parisienne was really good.  Another night I ordered the pasta alfredo....it was horrible!!!  It was bland, tasteless, for $16 came with no salad or piece of bread, it was like spaghetti with Elmer's Glue.  I wouldn't recommend that dish, there are other places you can go for much better pasta!  The service was so-so.  I ordered to go both times and the waitress was attentive enough, but as I sat there watched the wait staff play and text with their phones.  Hilarious.  This Dunn's is also located right next to a XXX massage parlor....just an FYI if you're thinking about brining the kids lol."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with friends to try the smoked meat in Montreal that everyone boasts about. It turns out it is pretty good but not as good as Katz deli in New York. Although you can rest assured the fries in Montreal is consistant in being pretty good so it works well as an ensemble dish. We were doubly happy that this place has free wifi see that Montreal treats wifi like a high commodity."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I snoozed and loozed my memory. It's been a couple weeks since 2 friends and I ate breakfast here, but I do remember that I had the \"Jackie Mason\", which was eggs and onions, home fries, toasted bagel and coffee. It was very good.  One friend had the standard sunny side up brekky in which he found no fault, and the other had the enchilada, \"although it really wasn't what (he) would recognize as an enchilada. More of an open ended burrito\". He enjoyed it though.  It was pretty slow at 9:30 on a Monday morning, and our server was quite attentive.  NB I seem to recall a side of lettuce and tomato which was inedible. Save the tomato until it's in season."}
{"text":"The food was good,  the ambiance was nice and the service was quick. Definitely try the poutin and the cheesecake.  Best part of the meal!  Highly recommend this to all who pass by Laval."}
{"text":"Given a mini( petite ), but ordered and Paid for a late... food wasn't that good and bad service, waitress was rude, I wouldn't go back although it's close to my hotel room... I just won't eat..."}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips. I like how the fries came out in a mini fry basket. The fish was good and crunchy. The tartar sauce was different but not in a bad way. Our waiter was great, he even made me a vanilla and chocolate mixed milkshake."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were in town for a Dallas Stars game and wanted to try some poutine so we walked to Dunn's Famous as it was close to our hotel. Although they had quite a selection, we went with the traditional QUÉBÉCOISE. It was delicious. Next we shared the super combo smoked meat sandwich and which was moist, smokey, and served with the right amount of mustard. We had room for dessert so we chose the hot cookie and ice cream and we were glad we did. The cookie was thick, hot, and chocolatey with a healthy serving of ice cream and cool whip (in Stewie's voice) slowly melting on top. The staff was quick and attentive.  Bonus: we were wearing our Stars gear and the wait staff talked hockey with us for quite a bit."}
{"text":"came here first thing in the morning after the CN Tower Climb!   was very happy how fast we were seated and served. I had the eggs Bennie with spinach and it was good, not the best. the eggs weren't cooked properly, nor was I asked how I'd like them.   don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"Service: 4/5 Food: 4.5/5 Ambiance: 3/5  I visited Montreal for vacation, and heard \"smoked meat\" was one of THE items to try. There were a few places on my list, but I ended up here at Dunn's. I came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and it wasn't too crowded when I first walked in. Ten minutes later, it seemed like an entire middle school or high school took over the restaurant, so it became super loud/noisy. This is a very casual place, so I couldn't get too irked by the crowd.  The smoked meat here was absolutely delicious. The meat was so tender and fell apart. I loved that there were three choices: lean, medium fat, or super fatty. I opted for the medium fat, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. I will say that I was also pleasantly surprised by the cole slaw. It wasn't doused in mayo like many places I've been to, and the flavor was refreshing/wonderful when paired with the smoked meat. Overall, I really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Perfect place for quick in and quick out, our recommendation is the various Poutine and the smoked meat spring rolls.  The food is A-Okay and the place is casual, nice stop for a beer.  The feel is that of a tourist destination which was actually welcomed, it feels like a spot you'd hit in Times Square, folks from all over the globe, literally, sharing a beer and Poutine! Nice."}
{"text":"It was -11 F (sorry, from the U.S.) outside and I wanted to go to schwartz's, but Dunn's was two blocks away. I'm a genius. The medium smoked meat on rye was comparable to katz's pastrami in NYC, maybe better, since there wasn't an ounce of fat on it but yet just as tasty. Got take out, but the dining space seemed nice and cozy."}
{"text":"Probably my fault for not trying their smoked meats but after 3 straight days of Meat & Poutine, I wanted a chicken plate for dinner. Asked the bartender if he recommended the Chicken Tender appetizer or the Buffalo Chicken Wrap with Fries. He said to try the wrap.   I can not recommend Dunn's. The buffalo chicken wrap that I received was basically a lettuce wrap with poor quality wings sauce. I would not eat that dish again even if they paid me $20 to finish it. My friend had the General Tao Poutine and he said it was the worst Poutine he had during our 3 day trip in Canada. Do yourself a favor and try a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Psyched to try classics. Sad to learn: cold cheese poutine. Smoked meat's just deli."}
{"text":"We ate here to try poutine, and the whole place was nothing special. The ice tea tasted like concentrate, the waiter was friendly but not over attentive. Poutine was o.k., the fries were great and crispy and tasteful, but were unfortunately soaked by the watery-greasy gravy. We went again the next day, our new waiter was very nice and helpful, burgers were great and I could really enjoy the great fries! As we wanted to have desert, we were advised very well and even told which ones come frozen and which are freshly made (the first time I experienced this, left me stunned and slightly incredulous it actually happened). We chose to share a fresh apple pie and it was amazing! So turns out poutine is just not my thing, yet I can totally recommend Dunn's!"}
{"text":"The smoked meat was very sumptuous and delicious and we had poutine with it which was an extra delight! Our waiter suggested to order medium and we did and were not disappointed. So juicy warm tender. The music was soft rock and relaxing. You could watch the soccer game on the tv. Loved it."}
{"text":"On our trip to Montreal, we decided that we HAD to try smoked meat and poutine....we just had to.  We had walked by Dunn's several times and finally the craving hit us in the late evening.  First, the restaurant is open crazy hours...we didn't have to worry about being kicked out because it was after 10 pm.  We shared poutine and then I had a smoked meat sandwich, while my husband had the meat platter.  This was our very first pouine (!)  and it was divine.  The gravy and curds mixed with the fries were just wonderful. The gravy had great flavor, the texture of the cheese was good...I could have eaten another bowl of this stuff!  I couldn't get enough of it - but I knew I had a large sandwich coming.  I don't know what we were necessarily expecting...but we were pleasantly surprised by both meals.  We ordered the \"normal\" meat - not the really fatty or not the really lean.  The meat was tender, had great flavor and, although simple, very satisfying.   My husband loved all the meats on his plate...while the dish came with bread, he didn't want to waste any space on the carbs and just slayed all the meat.  Definitely a great stop in our short visit."}
{"text":"C'est bien en général, le décors est bien joli, le service est bien. J'ai trouvé la nourriture un peu décevante en fonction de leur réputation. La présentation des mets est plus que ordinaire, mon sandwich est arrivée tout croche, le pain pas du tout grillé avec tellement pas de moutarde que c'était presque triste ! En plus l'alcool est vraiment cher, câline 22$ un pichet de Richard´s Red... Je connais des bars tout prêt qui vende 21,25$ le pichet de Red pour 4 litres ! Enfin c'est bien mais pas extraordinaire !"}
{"text":"I stopped in here while my friends were at the hockey game. I was dying to try authentic Canadian poutine! I sat at the bar and I ordered Dunn's original poutine with smoked meat. I watched the hockey game while I waited and within a short amount of time I had my poutine. It was delicious! Way too much for 1 person, but I made a good dent in it! Service was friendly and the place looked like a great place to grab some pub food."}
{"text":"Wish we went to Schwsrtz instead. Smoked beef was ok and very poor wait staff (ours was horrible. The rest looked very attentive to their customers). Oh well..."}
{"text":"My new fav place. I will have to refrain from eating here everyday of my vacation."}
{"text":"Dunns used to be the place I would go when I first got to Montreal,  but that slowly changed over time as I discovered much better places for smoked meat around the city such as the Main.  Dunns has that interesting diner feel to it and it's located at the heart of the tourist area in Montreal.   Usually the service is alright here, but there have been a handful of times I've gotten service that is beyond terrible.  I'm not talking they were slow or forgot to fill our drinks terrible.  I'm talking they slammed drinks on the table, dropped food on our laps and acted like we were bothering them when we would do a simple thing like ordering.   On top of this the portions have gotten much smaller and the smoked meat just doesn't cut it compared to other places around town.  This definitely is not a place I frequent anymore and it's mainly due to the staff."}
{"text":"This was the best poutine I've ever eaten in my entire life. I should qualify this by saying that while I've eaten a lot of poutine in my day, I'd hesitate to call myself an \"aficionado\" in the realm of fries topped with gravy and cheese.  That said, this was damn good. The kind of good where you take one bite and immediately realize how amazing it is. You chew franticly and swallow so you can tell the person across from you what they already - this is the best poutine you've ever had in your life.  It's a kitschy little place with table top illustrations featuring video games and sports. They've got waiters who wear golf shirts with the restaurant's logo and serve their beverages in those classic fogged plastic cups. And I wouldn't change that for anything. The atmosphere is definitely a huge part of the experience.  With my poutine I had a serving of smoked meat with slaw and a pickle and can attest to the fact that the portions are big (and perfect). It might be a lot for an average eater, but if you're big on quantity, this is the place.  Oh and lastly, the food came within 5 minutes of ordering - I'm not exaggerating even a little about that. I'll let you decide whether that's a pro or a con.  So to recap - fun atmosphere, fast service, delicious food and poutine you'd kill for."}
{"text":"Good smoked meat.  Can get full fat.  Do get full fat.  Fat.... mmm... fatty fatty fat fatt..."}
{"text":"Delicious smoked meat sandwiches! Just lucked into this place the first afternoon in Montreal. Once we settled in of course we had to try the other famous smoked meat place who's name starts with an \"S\". No comparison. This place wins has hands down."}
{"text":"We stopped in here twice in one day.  The first time was a planned visit, but the second time was a late food run.  My friend was determined to try smoked meat.  She ended up ordering poutine topped with smoked meat and she liked it.  I ordered a dry grilled chicken sandwich, but it was nothing special.  During our late night visit, I had a really good vegetarian pizza.  I was surprised at the freshness of my toppings and the generous topping of cheese."}
{"text":"I'll give it an extra star since prices have gone up elsewhere.  I just tried their breakfast, tasty eggs and decent sized for 7 bucks is pretty good around these parts."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for \"medical tourism\" with family and this restaurant was right next to the pharmacy for their medicine.  I had to wait for prescription and was walking so I ate here right next door.   I had a thai salad with grilled chicken which was excellent and went back to buy a gift of a box of their smoked meat, frozen, and it is what we in the states call pastrami, really good, steamed up great, I will back to Montreal and Dunn's Famous!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the smoked meat sandwich and a side québécois poutine both were amazing.  Service was quick and our server was able to speak English as my French is as basic as it gets.  Would recommend to anyone looking for the best smoked meat in town"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday for lunch. The server was very friendly. Portions are very big, so consider sharing if you've got a small appetite. The ambiance is like a sports bar, TVs everywhere and comfy seating."}
{"text":"Their normal cheesecake was sold out as some came in and bought 2 of them at $90 a pop, but I had the apple caramel cheesecake which was quite remarkable. Good smoked meat too. Great staff. Didn't realize they closed at 8pm on Fridays and they didn't say a word to me. They closed at 8:25pm when I was done! Would have gotten 5 stars but I like a bottomless soda glass."}
{"text":"Dunn's is probably one of your best diner options in downtown Montreal, especially if Mr Steer is too crowded. Kitch old school diner, lots of printed article about their greatness, and everything red. Interesting.  We had the smoked meat fried rice, which was rice, minced smoked meat, and a few veggies. Just okay. We also had the smoked meat poutine, which was totally legit. Fresh curds, good fries, and squeaky cheese. There was a lot of the smoked meat on it, which was nice, and it added a really nice texture to the poutine.  You could do a lot worse than the poutine and smoked meat at Dunn's. But it's not like it's worth a special trip or anything."}
{"text":"Yelp's average of 3.5 is how I feel about this place.  Another smoked meat place, but they're open 24 hours!!!!  Awesome.  If you needed a place to eat in the middle of the night... this is the place I'd go.     I actually had the smoke meat fried rice.  Random I know... but that's just what called out to me at 4am in the morning.  Lots and lots of flavor in this particular dish.   Typically, the ingredients in fried rice don't have this overwhelming amount of flavor.  But with those smoked meats, it makes this dish super intense with flavors.  (maybe too much?)   it's garnished with cubes of tomatoes which I actually really wish they added more of.  The tomatoes helped sweeten each bite of the fried rice.  Also tried the chicken noodle soup, it was \"okay\".  Noodles were kinda thin and clumped all together.   The initial service was  SUPER ... but they were VERY very busy.  I can kinda forgive them for that.  As the meal progressed, they were a lot more attentive."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, by the time the food arrived it was cold and did not taste good. Not to mention I got over charged, delivery service was terrible. Also, got food poisoning the next day from the burger and smoke meat. Should have listened to the locals and took their advice and ordered elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thought this was a great place for no frills Montreal / Canadian food. This place is popular enough but without the insanity of lines. We stopped by early in the afternoon on a weekend and were seated immediately.   I got their reuben smoked meat sandwich and subbed out the fries for poutine (+$4), which was 100% worth it. At this point in my trip, I still haven't had any poutine. I probably should have gone with the la petite sandwich because I could only finish about 3/4 of my meal. The poutine was great and just as good as I imagined it would be. The smoked meat sandwich was good but not as good as the one I had a day earlier at another restaurant. The bread was a little too dry around the edges, so I ended up peeling off the crust. Overall, a good value and place to stop by if you want something casual and local."}
{"text":"We came here for a bite to eat before catching a show at the Royal Alex.  I have been to the Dunns in Montreal.  The smoked meat was comparable in quality and taste.  The food was good and came quite promptly which is important for the theatre district.    The annoyance factor was the speed of service or lack thereof.  We waited at least 15 minutes for someone to take our order.  They are talented at avoiding eye contact!!  Once the order is done the food comes quick. We had to help another table flag down the server to get their bill by literally yelling at the guy to catch his attention.  NOT good service!!   Rating is based on food.  Definitely room for improvement on service."}
{"text":"What we ordered (4 ppl sharing)  -Thai chicken salad  -pout toute garnie (poutine recommended by our server) -smoked meat platter (2 platters for 4 ppl would seem just. You can opt out for their sides and get a meat only platter)"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has been open so long.  They have the worst staff I've ever seen. They all stand around playing on their phones they are dressed like bums and just laugh in the back instead of helping others.  Worst food Ever.  We asked which was better the egg rolls or the spring rolls with smoked meat. Litteraly puke worthy. Taste like Pee and dog hair I couldn't Believe they served that to people.  Burger was disgusting it was pretty much raw and no flavour. The bun was old. No sauce just simply disgusting.  I can't believe I went back here twice in once week if I could give them a 0 star I would.  One woman in the resto asked for the manager to ask why their was no chicken in her hot chicken and everyone turned around the manager just added some more same plate it's disgusting behaviour I will never return and be sure to let everyone know."}
{"text":"Great 24 hour joint. My usual late night stop. They have a varied menu and everything I have had has been fine.  I am partial to the smoked meat poutine, but also enjoy the sandwiches and even the steak. This is not a high end steakhouse, but more a place to grab a bite and a beer with friends, although as I non-drinker I can only base that on my friends."}
{"text":"Dunns famous Caesar Bloody Mary type drink is awesome! They will put the game on if a match is in progress. Specialize in smoked meat and poutine. Not hard to go gluten free here if you are into meat. Cool atmosphere and decor. I enjoyed the smoked meat with fried rice, tomato, shallots. Potato skins with cheese and bacon are awesome."}
{"text":"Un classique de Montréal, situé en plein centre ville Smoke meat délicieux, à essayer à tout prix Ambiance bistro, décor sympa, service très bon Le midi il n'y a pas trop de monde, le soir un peu plus Grand choix de plats Prix abordables A essayer vraiment!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 2/5 stars because I really didn't find the food that great. The service was fine, but the quality of the food seemed to be cheap. I ordered the hamburger steak with mashed potatoes, and it seemed like it was a premade frozen hamburger. I was expecting a nice thick dark sauce, but that was not the case (see pic). The taste really wasn't that great.  Me friend ordered the Thai salad but it was so spicy she couldn't even eat it.   There were a couple other friends with me also and their food was also just okay. Nothing really stood out or made us want to go back."}
{"text":"Dunns  My first exposure to Dunns was when I lived in Ottawa.  The Dunn's on Elgin was one of my favourite places to eat.  When I moved back to Toronto there was a Dunn's at Empress Walk.  It lasted a few years, but Torontonians never warmed up to Montreal smoked meat - shame on them.  So on our family vacation to Montreal, we had the opportunity to dine at the original Dunn's.  To me, this is like the Holy Grail of Dunn's locations.  Going in, I was surprised just how small it was given the size of the other locations we had been to.  Still its not size that matters, its how the food tastes.  I had the Super Smoked Meat Sandwich, and my wife had the Classic Club.  The kids split chicken fingers and a cheese pizza amongst the three of them.  Our food arrived, then I had a mixed experience.  My smoked meat sandwich was good.  However my recent smoked meat at Brisket Montreal (Salon Krausmann) was better.  The fries were ok, but as memory serves me the fries at the other Dunns locations were just ok as well.  My wife gave her lunch a 7 out of 10, and the kids were very happy with the pizza, and the chicken fingers got an ok.  The detractor of the meal was the table beside us.  The general manager of the Dunns chain was there with a salesperson, discussing their television advertising plan.  I didn't need to hear two loud talkers during most of my meal.  Management should know better and should discuss plans in their office."}
{"text":"I had the day off one day and I decided to stop in for breakfast, since I actually had time to sit down and enjoy myself. I'm not sure how this place is for lunch or dinner, but breakfast was definitely off.   I had the combination- I really don't remember what it was called, but it came with sausage, bacon, ham, pastrami, a bagel, potatoes, and eggs.   Strike 1 - Out of sausage. Hold on a second, you guys just opened up and you're already out of sausage? The place was empty when I got there and it was pretty early, kind of mind boggling how you're already out. At any rate, I took more bacon as a substitute.   Strike 2 - Bagel tasted stale and was burnt all the way through. I love bagels, but this one was just disgusting.   Strike 3 - The ham and the pastrami were both cooked awfully. Seems like the cook was more focused on putting these cool looking grill marks on the ham and the pastrami that he didn't bother to check that it made the meat taste like garbage. It just tasted burnt, no flavour at all.  Now I'm not a huge baseball fan, but I'm sure three strikes means you're out. Never coming here for breakfast again. Maybe I came on a bad day but this place sucked. If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Dunn's is as advertised....OUTSTANDING.  Service was great, the smoked meat poutine was divine and the super meat club sandwich was heavenly.  Definitely hit it again on next trip"}
{"text":"J'ai pris la poutine au smoked meat et j'ai été très déçu (j'aurais même mis 1 étoile si au final, je n'avais pas mangé à ma faim quand même). Les vieilles traditions ne sont pas toujours les meilleures"}
{"text":"I've been here three times and got something to go once. The staff speaks English and is very helpful. The pizza is actually pretty good. Their desserts are awesome!! It's a good place if you want good food but don't want to leave your comfort zone. The hours make it super convenient. It's a definite must see while in Montreal."}
{"text":"Descoberta super gostosa! Pedi o sanduíche tradicional de carne defumada e não me arrependi :)"}
{"text":"Decent food, priced well with good service. I think the menu pictures make it look a tad better than it actually is. Worth giving a shot. I had the fried rice dish, was tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Food quality was not up to other Dunn locations. As of November 2012, the place has closed and has become a new joint called Smoky's"}
{"text":"Really appreciated the quick service even though we were a big group. Food was great. Had the Dunn's poutine which was with smoked meat."}
{"text":"Excellent! We asked our hotel's concierge where could we find a good smoked meat restaurant and he directed us in the right direction! So off to Dunn's Famous! We started our meal with wings (with the Buffalo sauce on the side). Now, as Americans we are wing connoisseurs, however, among wings connoisseurs your tastes may vary. Some like their wings fried very hard, some not so much. I'm on the \"not so much side\" which is why I gave this Restaurant overall 5 stars, but I didn't really care for the wings. My boyfriend, and most of my friends, prefer that their wings be friend hard, not me, and to me they were fried way toooo hard but the sauce did make up for it.   But now on to the main event...the smoked meat. We both had the smoked meat plate which was smoked brisket on rye with mustard, and sorry, I insisted on adding Swiss cheese to my sandwich. It came with house made chips (fries) and homemade coleslaw. Yummmmm! Now the coleslaw was a bit different from what I'm used to. Everywhere I've been in Montreal, the coleslaw has been vinegar based and not mayonnaise based and I'll admit I really enjoyed it. It had a much lighter taste.  Now as far as the sandwich is concerned, interesting. Now I'm from Philadelphia, PA and I grew up in Jewish Delis. Shout out to Murray's Deli and Hymie's Deli on Lancaster Avenue in Bala Cynwyd, PA. Best deli sandwiches ever. But back to my review, I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and it was so large that I could only eat 1/2 of the sandwich, 1/5 of my fries yet all of the coleslaw.  Delicious!!   And the crazy part is that they're open some insane schedule, like 24 hours. Our server was great and she was very knowledgeable. I believe her name was Ali and she had quite a sense of humor. Yo be maybe 20 something, she ran that restaurant like it was no one's business. So if you are looking for great smoked meat, or are hungry after everything else is closed check out Dunn's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner after a movie on Christmas night. Food was tasty. Open Christmas was nice. Service OK. Somewhat annoyed that we were seated in a small booth with no coat hooks vs. the open, slightly larger booth next to it where they sat two people 30 seconds later. Small annoyance, but frustrating."}
{"text":"Not as good as it was, but what is?   Still, the smoked meat was very good, as was the cheesecake. Fries were good. Coleslaw, check. Matzo soup, check. Good service and decent atmosphere right in downtown Mtl."}
{"text":"Downtown old style cafe. Venue is dingy  on the outside but welcoming once inside.   It shows its roots and is touristy. Seating is stall style. The food makes up for the age. The French fries are fresh cut and nicely cooked. The smoked meat sandwich is overfilled with meat- really good. Coleslaw appears to be made on site it's nice crunchy but a bit heavy on sugar.  Pro tip. Eat the fries quickly as they will cool.  Ice tea is premix with sweetener and lemon flavoring - in my case - yucky. Water or beer draft is a much better choice."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday and dined outdoor; great location for people and car watching with the lush green Mount Royal framing the backdrop!  I had the smoked combo meat.  I ordered lean meat and with fries.  I found the fries to be the best part of my meal!  The smoke meat, despite being lean, still had lots of fat.  The smoke meat was blend and didn't taste special -- actually, almost no flavor.  It was C$17.  Well, I can cross off from my bucket list Dunn's, established since 1927.    IMHO, Schwartz's is much better with no pretensions and worth visiting again and dinning there -- it's a classic diner that looks like the original when it first open decades ago; even before I was born :)"}
{"text":"Smoked meat poutine = the only way to kick off a trip to Montreal. Luckily our hotel was around the corner from Dunn's and we were able to make this happen as soon as we arrived.  Dunn's is a casual spot - basically like a hybrid diner / deli. The menu had a variety of different types of sandwiches, poutine and grill food. Because Montreal is known for poutine and smoked meat we opted for a big bowl of poutine topped with smoked meat. This wasn't the best pastrami that I've ever had, but was still delicious and tasted great mixed with the poutine. I also ordered a crock of french onion soup which was topped with tons of cheese and had great flavor. Nothing better when the high is below zero degrees!  We washed everything down with some cold Molson (okay, if you can't tell we were excited to be in Canada) and were in and out in under an hour. Overall, Dunn's is a solid pick if you want a fast hot lunch in Montreal."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal, we were told to try the smoked meat dishes, so we grabbed some food to go on our way to the Tam Tam.  The Reuben was perhaps the largest sandwich I've ever eaten, and they don't sacrifice flavor for size! Delicious. My wife loved her Downtown Wrap with its pickles and honey mustard sauce. The leftovers turned into an ample second meal later.  $17 may seem steep for a sandwich, but it turned into two meals and I think was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"1st meal in Montreal since 25 years ago.  Thought we'd start off here at Dunn's knowing that the smoked meat is sold en masse at Costco.  Saving the \"real\" one to later in the week. chicken poutine = ok matzoh ball soup = meh smoked meat sandwich fatty = pretty delish coleslaw side = nice offset latka side order = greasy and dense Atmosphere - not as active as remember Service - efficient Hoping for better smoked meat to be found elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Dunn's was highly recommended and did not disappoint. There was a large lunch crowd but it was not an issue. We were seated immediately and the service was great. The food came out surprisingly fast and was delicious. All the other customers seemed equally satisfied.   Dunn's has indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor area is covered and right on the street. Good if you want to people watch. The Underground City is a block away, only a 30 second walk."}
{"text":"I came here to Dunn's since it was out of Montreal and I wanted to see what all the fuss about the famous Montreal Smoked Meat was all about. It was an OK sandwich but it didn't thrill me. Neither did much else in the place. Bar was basic. A far cry from Pickle Barrel's. Prices were OK, though. Still not enough to make me warrant a return."}
{"text":"This was a religious experience. My boys and I tried various menu items including smoked meat sandwiches, poutine, smoked meat poutine. All were phenomenal and we will definitely lunch here again when the opportunity presents itself!"}
{"text":"Great food. Melt in you mouth smoked meat. Kosta our surfer helpful and attentive but not intrusive. Definitely go back"}
{"text":"It's no Schwartz but still a pretty good place to get a smoked meat sandwich!! The place is clean, service is good and so is the food!"}
{"text":"Went here because it was fairly close to the hotel we were staying at, was not disappointed in the service, nor the food, we both had the fish and chips and agreed it was one of the best pieces of fish we'd ever had! I would definitely recommend stopping by if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Visited this place based on the other reviews.  With the stress on smoked meat we were a little leery but decided to try it since it was a Montreal \"tradition\".  Anyways we should not have been worried, it exceeded expectations.  The restaurant, like Montreal, is from another era.  For both the city and the restaurant this is a good thing.    We were seated very quickly and frankly it took more time for us to read the menu than it did for the food to be delivered.  We ordered the large platter and asked that the fries be converted to poutine.  Bear in mind that smoked meat is basically pastrami.  This is very good pastrami.  For the most part it was very lean and tender.  The platter was served with several pieces of white bread which we used to build sandwiches with mustard.  In retrospect we should have ordered it with the melted swiss cheese though it was plenty good without it.  We ordered a second and there was none left when we were done.  With regard to the poutine it was very good.  It was not as salty as other places which is just as well since you can add that to taste.   We will visits again when we are next in Montreal."}
{"text":"So I had a mission to get a smoked meat sandwich while in Montreal. We were pretty beat, my wife's feet were hurting, so I got take out from this place.  She got the chicken finger kids meal (cause she's kinda boring like that) and I got the small combo smoked meat sandwich. I didn't see what was so special about the smoked meat sandwich. It was tender but bland to me. Also, it had some gristle. To be fair, this is what I found with the other smoked meat sandwiches in Montreal. The fries were good and the cole slaw was delicious. I would have been interested to try other things here because the rest of the food looked good. The guy that took my order was pleasant and the service was good.  They have their own cardboard box with their graphic design for take out, I like it for two reasons. One, it wasn't styrofoam, so it's better for the environment. Two, even though you're gonna toss it when you get home, you're bringing a piece of Dunn's with you with and to enjoy a little history about the place while you eat. I thought that was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. The salads are surprisingly good but you should go there for their smoked meat Poutine It's open 24hrs"}
{"text":"Little bit of a let down.  Had a very TGIFs feel."}
{"text":"So it was a lazy day in the household and we weren't feeling up for going anywhere or cooking anything. We grabbed the trusty \"Top Menu\" and voted on Dunns for delivery. NEVER AGAIN.  We ordered the Dunn's Pizza (the one with smoked meat, green peppers, onions, etc). Well, what can I say? The dough was so thin you could see through it. The toppings wouldn't stay on the pizza an its not because there were SOOO many toppings but rather the dough was thin. How do I know? I took all the toppings off one slice of pizza and held it up, I could SEE THROUGH it!!!!   Next time I'll stick with Dominos."}
{"text":"Helpful staff although at times overly keen to clear the table before the meal was even complete. Happened on two occasions and I politely told the bus boy the meal was not finished. However the side order of onion rings as taken away before it was finished and a waste of $7.00. Found the beef to be rather expensive for the quality of cut. Pasta was also disappointing. Seems the smoke meat is the strongest dish although not the best in Montreal"}
{"text":"Good food, but very poor/prejudice service. (It was myself and twin brothers birthday of all days)     We came here after a long day of being out exploring all things worth while and this was a 24 hr late night place that was recommended.     We were seated shortly after entering and provided menus by who we now know was the bus boy. There was a short bald headed Asian guy sitting at the booth closest to the kitchen who looked like he worked there, but just stared at us. We sat there for about 10 minutes before I had to get up and ask if we could please have some water. The bus boy brought us water and we sat almost another 10 minutes when a couple walked in, the bald Asian guy got up, seated them, gave them a menu, took their drink order and a short while later brought their drinks and took their order. (I'm speechless and trying not to be bothered by it)     I asked the Caucasian guy who seated us if it would be possible to order to which he replied \"I'm not your waiter\" (he wasn't rude, but it threw us off because no one else came by at all). The couples food came out, the bald Asian guy took it to them and then came over, did not greet us, but he took our order. I was hungry but did not order as I refuse to spend money when I'm not being treated fairly which appeared to be a prejudice on the Asian guys part (I want to be clear on the nationality so readers are aware who this is I'm speaking of as it was one individual.)     The bus boy brought our food out, and no one ever came back to the table. The bald Asian guy continued to stare as though he had a problem. I had to get up and get napkins for the table, and when we were ready to go and still no one checked on us, our gal pal had enough. She called for service, a togo box and the bill. The bald Asian guy comes to the table and my friend asks who our waiter is to which he replies \"Me\", she told him we wouldn't know because we haven't received service and with the exception of taking our order he hasn't been back once. He never apologized and gave us the bill.      I paid the bill, left no tip and we walked out. Some may know what it feels like being mistreated based on prejudice, but I'm aware some have the privledge of not having experienced it. Its an awful feeling when you've done nothing at all and are spending money.     I can't in good conscious recommend this place to anyone...it was very disrespectful and without cause. The one star is for the food/bus boy. I took no pictures as I will not promote them."}
{"text":"classic classic classic. A must go in Montreal if you're looking for a great smokemeat!"}
{"text":"Tons of food. Come here after a long day, if you just need good, greasy food and don't care about nutrition. Seriously good bang for the buck! The fatty cuts are really delicious. I would strongly going with any meat dish.   The poutine was okay. Nothing too special but not bad. I suppose I'm not the best judge but I've had a number of poutine dishes in Montreal and this one ranked middling.   The slaw was good!"}
{"text":"Very good like all other dunn's. This one however was a bit lacklustre in regards to service.  The smoked meat was good but a bit greasy and the fries were also a bit too over fried.  It's still a good place for good ol' montreal food.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat.  Could prefer more meat - not as great since the menu change but still delicious.  The service is great and the fries are crisp.  The Poutine could use some work. The portions are surprisingly small versus other smoked meat places..."}
{"text":"Came here to try the Montreal-famous smoked meat and poutine. The meal I had had me wishing I went somewhere else. Also not terrible, I found the meat overly salty and a bit odd-looking. The poutine was okay, but I found the fries a bit too oily. The redeeming factor of the place is the service-our party of 7 was seated quickly and the waitress was very sweet and attentive!"}
{"text":"24/7 restaurant, literally, so it is a place we go every once in a while when we find ourselves starving at 4am and everything else is closed. Everything is good, burgers, sandwiches, poutines, smoked meats, you name it. I usually go for a smoked meat sandwich and personally add chop liver all the time. That thing is not on the menu and I can't remember how come I got to know about this extra hidden feature, but somehow I know it and I always ask to put some extra chopped liver in my sandwich, check my picture. And I always ask for a chocolate milkshake mmm yummy..."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery on alce.ca (a la carte express)  I wanted to create my custom poutine.  I've ordered their poutine before and while it was really good...this was even better and I prefer the smoked meat thick sliced.    I ordered the smoked meat platter.  It's a generous half a pound of smoked meat and you choose how fat you want it.  I chose medium fat.  I was very marbled and moist.  It comes sliced thick, but falling apart and very flavorful.  The platter comes with fries, coleslaw and a half pickle.  I also ordered two sides of cheese.    I called ahead to ask how much gravy to order.  I explained how much I love gravy.  I ordered two and got two big tubs.  It was so much gravy.  I was elated.  It was so good and it was nicely seasoned.  My deconstructed poutine was so so great.  Exceeded my expectations.  I also ordered the the honey chicken salad.  Again a very generous portion, came with half an avocado.  I asked for extra dressing and there was plenty.  I was impressed with the value, the incredibly delicious smoked meat and of course the oodles of gravy."}
{"text":"I don't know if words can really explain my love for this place.   Rock solid food.   It's just a place that makes you feel like you're home.    The poutine looked amazing, but I didn't indulge this time.    Just a nice Montreal smoked meat sandwich, kreplach and matzo ball soup, and a molson export.    Merci beaucoup Dunn's.  Delicieux!"}
{"text":"Went there for a Friday night hangout.  The good: Lots of nice food choices. Decent pricing. Good size desserts. Good service. Good food (had the all dressed poutine). You can bring back home the rest of your dish, and it seems to be the standard there. Good portions. Tv on wall showing latest sport event. Has a bar. Clean and modern bathrooms.  The bad: Bathrooms downstairs, not on same floor level. Can get loud in the evenings. Can get quickly crowded in the evening.   Really good choice to go eat, since the place is open 24-hours. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"As sometimes I feel for a deli sandwich ... I figured dunns can work as I go there in MTL...got the combo as the man said just under $15 with tax...basically this is a two part meal...as in I ate half the fries sandwich & slaw .. The part two came a few hrs later lol luv this place ;)"}
{"text":"This is a great diner to hit, (rather than Nickels)...one of the better smoked meat spots within walking distance right downtown...family restaurant, good for kids, and yummy food.  (yummy is french for tasty)  If you are visiting Montreal and staying downtown, definitely stop by for lunch!"}
{"text":"I was told that their smoke meat fried rice is great. So I ordered one smoke meat fried rice and one smoke meat pizza. The smoke meat fried rice is ok, but I am impressed by the pizza. There are a lot of smoke meat on the pizza, it's so delicious. I will definitely go there next time and try other smoke meat dishes."}
{"text":"So. Much. Food!! I can't go to Montreal and NOT have smoked meat and poutine!   We were here for the Grand Prix last weekend and had to stop in to Dunn's once again for our fill of deliciousness. We were seated immediately and the service was quick and efficient.   I ordered the large smoked meat sandwich and upgraded to poutine. My husband got the Ruben and also upgraded to the poutine. Everything was so delicious and we received way more than we expected.   This restaurant was recommended to me last year by a friend and it was so good we came back. It will definitely be a Grand Prix weekend staple!  Love it."}
{"text":"Great for lunch or late night snacking. Smoked meat poutine is delicious and competes with the best in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Everything we ordered came in huge portions and was delicious. Not to mention that our waiter was over-the-top friendly and conversational and prompt.  I had the smoked meat sandwich and poutine with crumbled smoked meat on top of it. My wife had poutine and a delicious meat sandwich as well. We were both very happy. The beer was icy cold and service was prompt. The restaurant was clean and busy but service was quick. Overall we would definitely recommend this place to tourists checking out the Montreal smoked-meat scene."}
{"text":"After looking at their website and reading how famous Dunn's was in Montreal I decided to take my family here. The menu is fairly diverse and reasonable so there is something for everyone. At 5pm on a Saturday evening the restaurant was surprisingly empty. Being in the middle of the entertainment district I thought it would be busier. The service was good but rather stiff. The one male waiter was not rude but had little personality. He served us well but did not smile or say anything to make us feel welcome. I was quite put off by this. The food was very good. The sandwiches were substantial as were the salads. My nephew devoured his rack of pork ribs. The desserts were excellent, especially my carrot cake.  In conclusion, there are no complaints about the food. It is definitely a recommend establishment for casual dining in TO. However, the management must retrain their wait staff on how to create a welcoming atmosphere before I consider returning."}
{"text":"Le smoked meat est super. Par contre, lorsqu'on y a été, le fromage de la poutine goûtait le vieux. Vraiment mauvais goût même si nous avons fait changé notre poutine. C'est décevant qu'après le retour de l'assiette, malgré le fait qu'on ai mentionné que ce n'était toujours pas bon, la serveuse n'ait pas offert un autre alternative."}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Dunn's and I'll admit, I was pleasantly surprised.  Service was good, the food came quick, the booth was comfy and most importantly, the drinks have free refills.  I went with the standard smoked meat plate and it was some solid lean smoked meat. The sandwich is a bit smaller than what I'm used to but it was pretty good. The fries were good and the coleslaw actually pretty good as well!  All in all, a solid place to have quick lunch. The bill was decently priced."}
{"text":"I was told that Dunn's sandwich is a regional favorite and, if that's true, it's easy to understand why. I mean, wow. Perfectly cooked brisket with the right amount of smoke. Served on rye bread with a side of steak frites, cole slaw, and a pickle. I got the \"petit\" size but ordered the meat with \"more fat than lean.\" This is my idea of balance in life. :-)   There's more than sandwiches on the menu  -- pizza, pasta, and burgers are served too. I was very pleased that I took the suggestion to try Dunn's."}
{"text":"For Toronto, quite acceptable smoked meat, much better than the Montreal deli (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/montreal-delicatessen-and-family-restaurant-mississauga). Not stacked quite as high as the Montreal deli but a better quality smoked meat. The fries are pretty good and the slaw and pickle round it out nicely. All for $12.99 or just shy of $15 with tax.  Service is quick. My plate was brought out from the kitchen within minutes of placing my order."}
{"text":"The food  portions were big and both the desserts looked even bigger.  The food is a decent value for your money."}
{"text":"It was 4:30 pm when we arrived, tired and hungry after our long journey from out West. The dry airline pretzels our only sustenance up to now.   The sign beckoned us, like a sign from A higher power, \"Dunn's Famous\". I fell to my knees and wept, at long last, my precious. Montreal Smoked Meat.   I spotted a sign from above \"Massage\". Perhaps a massage while covered with smoked meat? One could only dream of such things.   It was early enough in the day that we were quickly ushered to a quiet, out of the way booth at the back. I hoped the waitress wasn't offended by my inquiry about the \"meat massage\".   We ordered up a couple frosty pints and chugged them with reckless abandon, the memory of our meagre airplane fare still fresh in our minds.   When hubby and I were married a blissful 10 years ago, he made a deal with a foodie. The deal was this, if I call \"sharesies\" then we are bound by matrimony to order things we could share so that no one person has to suffer by inadvertently ordering a \"lesser dish\". And so shall it be that we ordered the Super Combo Smoked Meat and Dunn's Famous Poutine. To share.  The food arrived at a breakneck speed, I barely had time to check out the vintage photographs lining the hallowed walls.  The food, ahhhh, the food! Tender and buttery soft smoked meat, ordered \"lean\" because hubby doesn't appreciate connective tissue and fat. Alas, that's one of the colossal responsibilities of \"sharesies\", to take the other parties preferences into consideration.   The delicately sliced meat was piled high, high, high, and nestled in between two little slices of incredibly fresh rye bread with a light smear of mustard. Nothing more was needed. A generous side of crispy fries, a saucer of fresh slaw and a slice of dill pickle. Perfection. Not one iota of pretension to be found.  The poutine was perfect. Hot and tasty fries, fresh, melty cheese curds covered with gravy and topped with chopped Montreal smoked meat. Uncomplicated and flawless.  Having lived my smoked meat \"foodie\" dreams, I believe I could die happy at this very moment. Except...we have 6 more days of culinary discoveries ahead.   I was born for this moment."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about theatres and delis.  If you have a theatre, you have to have a deli near it.  So, step forward Dunn's.  Found right below the offices of the Mirvish's themselves, in comes Dunn's.  It's formerly another Shopsy's and turned over some years ago with newer if not similar décor and a menu that would align with expectation.  It's a deli.  It has a deli feel with an open kitchen and an assortment of meats and sandwiches that you can select from and will definitely do in a pinch, and if you're not dashing in and out to go see \"Dirty Dancing\" (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/royal-alexandra-theatre-toronto), there's TVs with some game or other on for your enjoyment.  There's nothing bad about this place, but nothing truly wow-ing about it either.  It's a deli.  It's close to the theatre district.  That's probably good enough."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Fast service! I ordered Dunn's Poutine and had it within 10 minutes. Very much enjoyed it! Highly recommended giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"Dunn's is yet another one of those places one must check out their smoked meat when in Montreal.  Share a small smoked meat sandwich and share an order of poutine, french fries in gravy with cheese curds else, it's too much food.  Their quality is good, higher prices, open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast on a Monday morning.  Place was empty and service was so-so, but the portion was good and the food tasted great.  Only real downside was the smell...very greasy bar smell that you wouldn't want to carry with you throughout the day."}
{"text":"After having my Poutine I was set on having some more Montreal delicacies, so i went on the hunt for the smoked meats. I arrived at Dunn's Famous Steakhouse Delicatessen, I just finished my workout and I was looking to mange. I looked at the menu and i was instantly drawn to the smoked meat sandwich and the reuben sandwich. After all the contemplation I sealed the deal with the Reuben sandwich which had pumpernickel bread loaded with smoked meat and sauerkraut, coleslaw with a pickle, and a beautiful poutine. I found the food very delicious, the smoked meat was amazing with the sauerkraut. A great blend with the pumpernickel. The only reason it didnt reach the 5 star mark is because I already tried a poutine from La Belle Province and concluded that Dunn's poutine was inferior to La Belle's. Overall a great diner and dinner. I would definitely recommend this place, especially since I hear that its open 24/7."}
{"text":"Big fan of Dunns. Nice option outside of financial district but close. Have had a few business lunches there and the food is superb and always plentiful. The wait staff is accommodating, if a bit understaffed. The waiter looks run ragged. I had the 8oz Montreal Smoked Meat sammy with a side pickle and it was real good. I've had their combos and they are overwhelming but if you are hungry, simply brilliant."}
{"text":"Food was okay;  don't know if staff was fried from weekend shifts or too much partying, but really bad service.  I don't know why it was so hard getting anyone attention.  Too much of antourist hot spot I guess.  Place was empty when I was there for early dinner.  Ruebens down the street much much better and doesn't look like it's still 1964. (Decor here very dated). Too bad had high hopes, based upon local recommendations."}
{"text":"It dun taste so famous to me!  I mean, don't get me wrong.  It's not nasty or anything, but if something is famous I expect it to be out of this world.  I wish there were more healthy options as well, but if you want the best item on the menu.. stick with the Montreal Smoked meat sandwich.  That's pretty much as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Je ne suis vraiment pas une fan de smoked meat, toutefois un collègue voulait s'y rendre par nostalgie. Le restaurant est dans une petite rue très sombre. Le look est en effet, très vintage. Bien qu'en plein milieu du centre-ville où la clientèle est généralement jeune ou encore tie and suits, la clientèle du Dunn's est une clientèle de têtes blanches sympathiques venant revisiter de vieux souvenirs. Mes collègues ont bien sûr pris du Smoked meat qu'ils ont adoré. J'ai plutôt opté pour le gigantesque Cheese burger bacon. Les frites sont parfaites et le burger juteux, armez-vous de napkins et d'un grand appétit...."}
{"text":"I came here begrudgingly with some picky family members who don't tend to venture far from their North American palette. This is typically the last kind of place I will eat out at, with the mentality that if I wanted a sandwich, I could make my own at home.  With this preconception in mind, I actually left very satisfied. I had the fish and chips combo, and my wife had some kind of sandwich (very helpful, I know, but I can't remember at this point). We traded half of each of our meals and it was really good! The food was fast, fresh, and filling.  It's a big place with lots of seating, so it would be good for a group. The food came out fast, so it's also a good stop if you need to eat quickly before a nearby show. They don't offer a show discount like other nearby restaurants, but their prices are already fairly reasonable. I would come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place, dunn's famous smoked meat, i'ts excellent. Chicken caesar salad it's a must have, you should try la poutine too. It's open 24 hours, prices are a little bit high but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Acceptable but nothing to write home about. They don't refill the sodas, and they serve Pepsi instead of Coke without telling you"}
{"text":"Alright I originally posted this on Foursquare but since no one uses that, I came here to warn everyone else.   I walked in on a Tuesday morning, around 11 AM. Ordered the eggs benedict and a coffee.  Sitting at my table and admiring the few degenerates who were sketchily hanging around the entrance, my coffee arrives. Complete with a dead fly swirling in the top of the mug. WTF.   Benny arrives and it is stone fucking cold. Swear this could have been made a day ago and no one would be able to tell the difference. Bread was soggy, and the meat was tough.   Probably the worst meal I've ever had in Toronto, ever."}
{"text":"DINER HEAVEN   This is the original location of Dunn's Famous that opened in 1927. It's a diner that serves a little bit of everything. Our mission was to have the smoked meats and poutine. We arrived after 1pm when the Canadians hockey game started up the street. We wanted to plan it that way, so there wouldn't be a wait for a table. I want to say that we timed it perfectly. In fact, it started getting crowded as we were waiting for our food here. The best part is that the game was on the tv and we could enjoy watching it.   Our waiter was Fred and he was really nice. He was able to answer all of our questions and provided excellent service. We started out with two beers for us and a bowl of soup for the little one. I went with a Rickard's Red and my wife had a Coors light. I told her that the Coors was basically Canadian beer since Molson was brewing it up the street using Canadian water. The Coors in Canada has no Rocky Mountain Water in it.   The soup was really good. Imagine a baked potato that was turned into a creamy soup and then covered with all of the baked potato toppings including cheese and bacon.  The dish is brilliant because baked potatoes come free with entrees and I'm assuming the left over potatoes become soup. I love smart chefs. I do highly recommend the warm soup on a cold day. This soup hit the spot because it was totally cold in Montreal.   I also wanted to try poutine for the first time. I can not believe I've spent my culinary life avoiding this. I really didn't want to eat it in America. I think I wanted my first poutine to be an original and that's why I ordered it here. I also kept it simple by going with the gravy and cheese curds on top of the fries. I must admit that it was really good plus I had to fight my little one when eating these. I find it amazing to introduce brown gravy and curds to a child who instantly falls in love with the dish. I've got a little foodie on my hands.   Our main entree was the Ruben sandwich which was huge. It comes with fries, baked potato or rice. You can always upgrade the side for a price. We went with the onion rings for an additional $3. I figured we had enough fries with the poutine. The sandwich was amazing and it was enough to feed all three of us. It was a double decker served with a pickle, Swiss cheese, thousand island sauce and coleslaw on the side. It was truly delicious.   I also want to share some info about the meat. Montreal is famous for their smoked meats and the process they use really shows in the final product. A Montreal meat is brined for 14 to 20 hours and then smoked for 9 hours. Where an American corned beef is rushed with a brining as short as a few hours and then the meat being steamed for three hours. The Montreal version of corned beef will blow away your foodie senses. The meat is basically a beef brisket and when you order your sandwich you can choose one of three cuts: fatty, medium or lean. We stick to the medium because we want that flavor marbled in the meat. The Montreal smoked meat dates back to the 1890's, so it's a must have.   I highly recommend you get the smoked meats in Montreal. There are several old school places serving it. We choose this place because it's been doing it the longest. I wanted to go to a classic place that's been doing it right for almost 100 years. I can't wait to come back here. This place was a great addition to our culinary tour of Montreal."}
{"text":"We got the Reuben and Spaghetti with Meat Sauce! Both very good and flavorful :) the service was great and our server was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and both times were fairly unsatisfying.  Once for dinner, my DC and I were pretty much on our own, and when I dropped by solo for breakfast, the order wasn't correct.  Honestly, I didn't even bother complaining for a $4.99 breakfast, but when  a man wants his toast dry, the glisten of butter is a disappointment."}
{"text":"This has got to be one great restaurant. When they ask you if you want medium or medium fat, definitely say medium fat. I had the d deluxe and it was amazing. It came with onion rings, cheese sticks, potato skins, and meat egg rolls. The egg rolls were not great but everything else was incredible. Overall, I would have rated this restaurant a 5 if the egg rolls were not included.  The rest of my party got the smoked meat sandwiches and poutine.  The poutine was good.  But the smoked meats were amazing.   The others would have rated this place a 5, maybe because they ordered the right thing and i didn't."}
{"text":"I only had one one poutine my whole stay in Montreal and it was not the best but it was ok  although the service was quick"}
{"text":"Loved the smoked meat, it was juicy and tastes delicious. Was not loving the fries though. I ordered the spring roll as appetizer and I was not sold either. I will always come back for the smoked meat sandwiches though."}
{"text":"Beyond fantastic!  The food was great and so was the service!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Our first eat in Montreal. It was a late night and everything else was closed for Christmas. Service was ok , there were at least 4 servers to 5 tables and our guy seemed to look extra busy taking forever to bring our drinks. The meat was just ok, it tasted like corned beef rather than Canadian version of pastrami. Granted being from New York we are quite spoiled with excellent flavors but at least we have something to compare Canadian smoked meat to. The Poutin was also average. The best part of dinner was dessert .... We got carrot cheesecake and it was done just right.  The place is open 24 hours 7 days a week so after a drunken night Dunn's would most certainly satisfy the cravings, for a sober meal there are much better places."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and yummy food... didn't try the smoked meat but apparently that gets rave reviews. Pizza was pretty good, but really salty (?), which was weird for a pizza. Still decent, but unless you're looking for overtly salty food I would avoid it or ask beforehand. We also liked the Halloween decorations and general inviting/casual ambiance of the place. My only complaint was the downstairs bathrooms - total dump - no mirror and one working toilet. Supposedly they are under renovation so I would just avoid altogether if you can."}
{"text":"Everyone told me to come here for the poutine but fries covered In gravy and cheese curds just aren't my thing (forgive me). However this place is also known for its cheesecake which I did have. The carrot caramel cheese cake was heavenly!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you have been to Toronto Dunn's, forget it. This is a different place, the only thing they may have in common is the name. Menu, prices, service, everything here is from another planet. Is totally worth a visit.   I'll split this review in \"FOOD\" and \"SERVICE\" so it'll make more sense.   FOOD: FIVE SHINY STARS  I was going to have something like a salad, but, it's a deli, right? Let's ask for their deli plate. For 12 bucks you'll eat until you'll explode (and I shared the plate with husband) and I had the most awesome cole slaw of my entire existence. The platter also includes cornichons, peppers, sausages, green tomatoes, bell peppers, bread, I'd say it's big enough for three.   SERVICE: ONE FADING STAR, AND I'M BEING AWESOME  The service simply doesn't exist. I don't know why I had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, as the place was EMPTY and there were at least three waiters working on something (cleaning? cashier?)    CONCLUSION: (5+1)/2=3 OK Stars. I could give bonus points for cheap and good drinks, but, nah. Serve me better next time, dude."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I asked for a salad, and it was AWESOME and HUGE, and it had EIGHT GIANT SHRIMPS. I could not eat the entire salad! Husband asked for a sandwich and it was very good also, with a giant side caesar salad! Exceptional lunch and good prices.   But, as nothing is never perfect, the service is slow and the waiter had that bored face. So bored we had almost to scream for the bill. Too bad for a place with good food. They should hire better waiters, really.   Despite the bad service, I plan to return. The location is great, close to the subway, and I like giant good salads with LOTSOSHRIMPZ. You see, it's easy to have my love - offer me a good seafood meal for a reasonable price, and you get me. You don't even need a good waiter."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick meal. Their smoked meat is pretty good and the service is excellent.   I had the Dunn's Poutine and it was a nice hefty portion (could be shared between 2-3 people)  and it did not disappoint.   The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it has obviously become more of a tourist spot than an authentic place to have smoked meat."}
{"text":"I freely acknowledge that my five-star rating may have a little to do with the fact that I haven't had good poutine in years. But even if they didn't have poutine, Dunn's would be worth a visit for their smoked meat sandwich -- the way it melts in your mouth is just heavenly. (Why the Quebecois can't just call it 'pastrami', I don't know.)"}
{"text":"I like this place enough for grabbing a quick meal before seeing a show at one of the Mirvish theatres nearby. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, though. Their sandwiches, gravy, coleslaw, and pickles are all great.   I have no complaints about the place, but there is also nothing about it that blows me away or left me wanting to run to Yelp and write a review.   The prices are decent, service is good, and if I gave this place a report card I would give them a \"satisfactory\" in all departments."}
{"text":"Just a real waste of precious calories in a city with so many better options.  The poutine may impress American tourists who have little experience with the dish, but there are so many better options - Frite Alors is nearby, and probably just as far to your hotel.  Montreal's other foodie claim to fame is smoked meat, and here I'm less of an expert, but Dunn's just seems like flavorless pastrami to me.  If you have it as a sandwich it will come on thin unimpressive rye, just a bland disappointment.  So unauthentic that even the mustard is heinz.  The experience comes packaged within a dank diner environment, with menus disintegrating from age.  All in all it is a real disappointment, certainly underserving of an overall 4-star on Yelp, and resting on laurels earned decades ago (when the menus were printed)."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for a business trip and wanted some poutine (duh.) Dunn's was within walking distance and had a variety of poutines on its menu, so I strolled over. I sat at the (tiny) bar and was ignored by the staff until I asked for a menu and a beer. It wasn't busy. These kids just don't care! And, whatever, maybe it's their summer job to work in this poutine-slingery, but do your job right and attend to people who are ultimately paying your wages.  I ordered poutine with mushrooms, onions and peppers. And was so disappointed. The dish came out SO FAST that there's no way the veggies were freshly prepared. The fries were already soggy, and the lack of cheese curds (seriously, there needed to be way more of those delicate little gems) made me an unhappy diner.   And speaking of diner; what is this place? A soda stand? An indoor barn? It just emits a weird vibe and had a weird smell and overall, mehhhhhhh.  The next day I had some poutine in the airport on my way home and it slayed this place. If you're looking for gut-busting fries, gravy and cheese, maybe try another spot."}
{"text":"Montreal is famous for its smoked meat sandwiches so Gord and I had lunch today at Dunn's.  Gord and I both ordered Super Smoked Meat Combos (8 ounces of meat) with medium meat (so it was less lean).  Gord got his with a latke and I got mine with a baked potato. It was a delicious sandwich!  The meat was so tasty and tender.  Yum! Rebeccah was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Poutine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, so this wasn't the BEST I ever had but I still really enjoyed the poutine they served here.  Let's put it this way, I liked it enough that I went two days in a row.  That's also because I really liked their smoked meat sandwich platter ... which was just awesome.  The meat was good and I actually enjoyed this more than Schwartz's.  Yeah yeah call me crazy but I felt the meat here was more tender and juicy.  As someone who's lived off Jewish delis pretty much most of my life in NYC, I guess there was just something about Dunn's smoked meat that seemed to fit my palate better.  The service here was decent.  It got kind of busy both nights I was here but the servers were all still attentive and checked on us to make sure things were okay.  I was too pleased with my meal on both nights honestly to notice anything else ... so you get the idea.  That's not to say you shouldn't visit Schwartz's.  But if you're not near that area and you're looking for a good plate of meat and fries oozing with gravy and cheese curds and you happen to be in the downtown area ... you can't go wrong with Dunn's!"}
{"text":"After my family's horrible experience at another restaurant earlier the same day we decided to give Dunn's a try. I ordered a smoke meat poutine and a chocolate cake & tea. I received my chocolate cake first with my tea which was explicable. I decided to cancel my poutine as it was pointless and the service was so slow I just wanted have a bite and get out. The apple crisp another of my party ordered was very sugary and other order consisted of what looked like greasy finger foods. So from what I could tell the food is meh. The service was slow and meh. I won't be back but if you are stuck I suppose it would have to do."}
{"text":"Grosse soirée près de Peel ? Besoin de se rassasier avec du gras ? Poutine bien sûr ! Oui, mais si on a envie d'une poutine un peu plus grasse et dans un cadre un peu moins fast-food, on court chez Dunn's, ouvert 24h. Leur spécialité : la viande fumée. Alors quand ils en mettent dans leur poutine... On ne vient pas chercher ici la haute gastronomie, mais du réconfort. Et en réconfort, on est servi ! Les assiettes sont bien généreuses. Et pour ceux qui veulent un peu moins de réconfort, vous pouvez demander de la smoked meat lean. Le service pourrait être un peu plus aimable, mais on n'y fait pas trop attention à cette heure. Mise à part cette poutine smoked meat qui fait bien la job, Dunn's n'a rien d'exceptionnel. Attention les soirs de hockey l'endroit peut être vite rempli."}
{"text":"Great smoked sandwiches and filing too. They never disappoint. Service was fast and friendly. They have other dishes which are good but I recommend the smoked meat."}
{"text":"The conspiracy theorist in me is starting to think everyone gets their smoked meat from the same place. Do the French just sous vide everything?  Montreal pastrami has replaced NYC as being the best, in my book. This is going to cause problems in my marriage to a New Yorker. I'm still with him on bagels though so I think we're good.   This is my third restaurant and they've all been tender and delicious. I ordered a petit combo which was half a smoked meat sandwich, coleslaw and fries. Your typical platter. Zero complaints.  I do love the Montreal style of coleslaw (no mayo like its American counterpart).  I've yet to try Schwartz. Felt like I should gear up to them so I know what I'm talking about when I go visit the king of smoked meats. Have to say, it's not boding well for them as it seems you can get a really good sandwich just about anywhere."}
{"text":"Dunn's is the place where you have to go if you want to eat the best smoked me of Montréal !!"}
{"text":"Another go to place that I always come for when I want some poutine with smoked meat on top. However, times have changed and they give a slightly smaller portion compared to previous years I have visited. I'd recommend their rib eye steak as well."}
{"text":"Dunn's Famous in Montreal, QC is known for their smoked meat Sammmies, poutine, and cheesecake.   Our waitress was helpful and said it was a $4 up charge to add poutine to our lunch special. We ordered the smoked meat on a sesame bagel (best sesame bagel with sesames embedded). It also came with coleslaw and a pickle. The poutine was in a bowl and big enough to split, which we did. The fries, gravy, cheese curds had a good flavor. The smoked meat Sammie was tasty too. We also shared a small cup of their homemade cream of potato soup. It was creamy but had chunks of potato. Delish!! We sat outside and will definitely return when going back to good ol' Montreal!! Maybe we will try that famous cheesecake next time!"}
{"text":"What looks like a Canadian version of Applebees is really a NYC Jewish deli mixed with classic poutine.  My party and I were eager to try some Québecois local food and headed here after reading rave reviews - we weren't disappointed. The interior was strongly reminiscent of a family style American restaurant joint (think Chili's, Applebees, Ruby Tuesday, et al) with the booths, sports broadcast on the TV and dimmish lighting.  Our waiter was very attentive, friendly and courteous, unsurprisingly (what else do you expect from Canada?) and came out with our food quickly. Together, we had the Thai chicken wrap, French onion, bagel with smoked meat, and smoked Club - all dishes, whose fries side was upgraded to a Dunn's style poutine (fries, gravy, cheese curds, and more smoked meat, ho yeah!). It was all incredibly heavy and dense, but delicious. The meal was perfectly smoked and surprisingly tender (and this is me, a new yorker saying this) - the soup was a bit salty for my liking, but had a great baked fromage on top. The Thai chicken wrap had barely any kick even though the waitress warned us of one, and the slaw was a good complement to the saltiness of everything else. Even though I was off put by the heaviness of the gravy poutine, I can still admit it was stellar.  We ended our meal with a slice of strawberry cheese cake to share, and even though they had a layer or strawberry gelatin as a bed for the Strawberries, the cake was well balanced in decadence - not the heavy packed cream cheese block you see at a lot of places, but crumbly  as it should be, leaving a satisfaction without feeling like you're cheating.  Definitely enjoyed our meal, but still worried about my arteries!"}
{"text":"Un lugar con muchísimo encanto e historia en el que poder degustar un delicioso sandwich de \"Smoked Meat\" a lo grande: con tamaño gigante y acompañado de una buena ración de patatas. El local es un histórico de Montreal y en las paredes pueden leerse noticias relacionadas con él aparecidas en los últimos años, lo cual es realmente interesante.   En cuanto a la comida, sólo probamos el famoso sandwich \"Smoked Meat\" (fuimos a propósito a por él) y no defraudó en absoluto. Gran sabor y generoso acompañamiento en una  comida que hace que prácticamente te olvides de cenar. El resto de opciones del menú eran los típicos de la comida norteamericana: hamburguesas, batidos, aros de cebolla, postres como cheesecake...   El precio algo más alto de lo habitual para este tipo de comida, pero la experiencia (por lo histórico, el local, el servicio...) creo que bien merece la pena pagar ese extra.   Una buena opción para comer si estás por la zona comercial de Montreal"}
{"text":"Je donne un 4 sachant que cela reste tout de même un fast food mais de très bonne qualité et aux portions très généreuses. Le service est rapide, familier mais sans trop l'être. On s'installe à des banquettes un peu rétro, on a un menu diversifié et qui peut plaire à tous les goûts: smoke meat, poutines, sandwichs et wraps, pizza, salade ainsi que plein d'entrée à partager. Les prix sont également raisonnables. Je recommande si vous cherchez un repas simple entres amis, si vous voulez vous remplir le ventre après une soirée arrosée sachez qu'ils sont ouverts 24h ce qui est vraiment rares dans le centre ville et ils étaient même ouverts le 25 décembre !!!! On m'a également dit que leur petit déjeuner avec pancakes en vaut vraiment la peine!!! Alors GO on se gêne pas pour se faire un petit repas bien cochon  :)"}
{"text":"great smoked meat place (ask for medium).. right downtown / next to the movie theatre.... in and out in less than 1 hour.. reasonably priced.. nice / fast service..."}
{"text":"It's like Denny's in the states, but they have poutine and smoked meat! What else do you expect service wise? Definitely hit the spot late night/early morning after going out. Service is typical of any 24/hr coffeshop type of joint.  Completely acceptable imo."}
{"text":"From the reviews I was leary about eating here.  It was much better than I expected, I shared the smoke meat platter with a friend for lunch and there was plenty of food.  If I was going to show downtown I would probably go back.  Fast service, fresh food."}
{"text":"My family and I have been indulging in Dunns smoked meat for years now and the food has never let us down. The meat is so soft it falls apart in your mouth and the fries are fantastic. Order a smoked meat platter, drizzle some vinegar over your fries, eat and enjoy.   We just came back from Montreal and it's been about 4 years apart from my last time here and I remember the portions of food being larger. Or was I just smaller? Nonetheless the smoked meat is the best around in my opinion and I highly recommend grabbing a plate of Montreal's finest when you visit the city.  Also be sure to try a piece of their famous strawberry cheesecake!"}
{"text":"It doesn't really matter who you are, where you're from, or where you're at... when hunger slams you like a 50 ton pile and its well past midnight, you start looking for options.  ANY option thats open and has decent looking food. This happened to me during my recent trip to Montreal, and Dunn's made such an impression on me that I had to visit twice.  First, it was open when I landed and settled into my room at 3am. Just a short drive from my hotel, weary from a full day of flights and layovers, I was greeted with a friendly smile and cheerful attitude as soon as I stepped foot in. Needless to say there weren't many customers inside at 3am, but friendly service at any hour is always a plus in my book.  The restaurant is clean, well lit, and really made me feel like I was in any of the deli's I've frequented in NY or LA. The booth was comfortable. The bathroom was clean!   Food-wise, I chose a burger. Blame it on my Americana roots if you must, but its been my experience that a lot can be said about how a place serves up a burger. The 1927 really hit the spot; a soft bun, cheese melted just right that it wrapped lovingly around the layers of condimental veggies upon my perfectly cooked beef patty.   My first experience was so moving that I just had to swing by again my last night in town, and again I was not disappointed. I opted for the burger topped with smoked meat that was so tender and just melted away with every bite. The poutin upgrade comes in its own serving bowl that was so huge I couldn't finish.   I understand that I'm not local and perhaps my two visits were nothing more than flukes, but the service was outstanding. It gets busy when you've got a reduced crew and 8 booths filled with equally starving clients... but from what I saw everyone that works, hustles. It would be a different story if I saw one or two of them sitting on their asses playing Pokemon Go or updating their Facebook pages about how much attitude these asshole customers have given them, but I saw nothing to support this position.   Bottom line is if you're hungry, and remotely interested in good food in a clean environment with friendly service anytime after midnight, you won't be disappointed with Dunn's.    ...and if the server DJ from NYC with the shaved head is reading this, I stand true to my word... if they ever open a location stateside and you're given that location, I will fly out to enjoy another meal under your watch.    Many mahalos! ."}
{"text":"Unique decor and atmosphere - was surprisingly quiet when I went on Saturday around 930pm. Might've beat the dinner rush and was too early for the late night crowd.   I tried the smoked meat poutine which was pretty good.  We tried to compare a Schwartz sandwich to this poutine but found that both are good in their own ways. The smoked meat from Dunn's is similarly flavourful.  Since this was our last meal after an entire day of non-stop eating, we didn't order anything else.  Nevertheless, this place is worth dropping by for some smoked meat!"}
{"text":"Not a restaurant that I would recommend as a first date, but definitely something to try when you have munchies since they're open 24 hours. This restaurant is pretty new in the area.   Balsamic salad with chicken was very good and big enough to fill up yourself.   I tried the famous cheesecake topped with strawberries and I also liked it.  Service was great, fast."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I went here with my family while we were staying in Montreal for the week. This was an inviting little restaurant with about a dozen tables and a bar.   I ordered the hamburger steak and my wife ordered a poutine bowl.   Our waiter explain how the poutine bowls in Quebec are the best around because of the curds. Mu wife agreed she bought the dish was delicious.  I loved the hamburger steak. I usually am not a big fan of break anyway. I felt like I could eat more hamburger meat because of the lack of bread. It was great and it inspired me to recreate the dish at home.  The waiters were awesome and we asked some questions about the area and they were very knowledgeable and friendly. It was a very chill atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"Diner with lots of menu options.  Could use some updating decoration wise but liked that it was the same location since 1927.  Had the fried rice smoked meat - solid dish but nothing exceptional.  Would not have known it was smoked meat if not for the menu.  Service was adequate."}
{"text":"Ok so j'y suis retourné avec un ami a 2 heure du matin. habituellement un désastre, pas assez d'employé pour servir les saoulons de nuit. Mais notre serveur cette fois-ci a vraiment changer mon opinion. Très rapide, il servait 7-8 tables en même temps, et il était partout. Pas d'attente avant d'être assis. Pas trop long pour avoir notre lunch. 20 minutes max."}
{"text":"This place came up on Yelp as an eatery near our hotel and the hotel concierge enthusiastically supported our choice when we asked her for directions. We had the smoked meat sandwich (the large is big enough to split with another), the Dunn's famous poutine (the gravy was delicious and the cheese curds melted in your mouth like savory gravy covered marshmallows), and the Louisiana soup was a creamy, cheesy, potato soup bowl of yum.   Each of us tried a different Canadian draft beer..Molson Export, Rickard's Red, and Rickard's White. Delicious.   Service was friendly and efficient. Oh gosh, how could I forget? We also had the carrot cake cheesecake and the apple crisp for dessert..split four ways. The carrot cake cheesecake was tasty but the apple crisp was my preferred dessert. Lots of rich apple flavor."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and quick, food was delicious and not expensive."}
{"text":"Really good stright up food. Large pirtions and pub like athmosphere. Really chill place. Decent service. Theyve got tvs around to watch the game."}
{"text":"While casually strolling the streets we saw this place and thought we should come in and try the smoked meat. Why? There were pounds of smoked meat displayed in the window and I immediately turned into one of those cartoon characters. You know, the ones where they smell food and their bodies drift toward it. Yea, that was me when I saw smoked meat in the window.  They have a pretty vast menu so I'm assuming there's something for everyone. My bf ordered the smoked meat sandwich and I ordered the poutine with smoked meat on top. The smoked meat sandwich was pretty good. The meat was tender and fatty and damn near melted in my mouth. The poutine was ok. I'm not sure why, but the smoked meat on the sandwich was a lot better than the smoked meat on top of the poutine. Also, I wasn't a huge fan of the gravy. It was kinda watery. I prefer gravy that's a bit thicker.  The service was awful. We were greeted and given menus when we walked in but people kept walking by us until finally we had to flag someone down for waters. Then, they took our order (finally). It took forever to get the check and no one ever stopped in to see if we needed anything else. We ate, paid, and got the hell outta there. It could have been a 4 rating if the service wasn't so crappy."}
{"text":"I dont know what the hype was all about. It was just average.  Service was slow and the food was greasy.  Cheap drinks were appreciated though!  I liked the smoked meat fried rice but everything else left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Tried the house special poutine with their famous smoked meat. Was very delicious!!  Plus they're opened 24hrs.. Fixed the late night crave!"}
{"text":"Delicious classic smoked meat"}
{"text":"Great smoked meat sandwiches! I split two of them during my two days in Montreal. The first time during the day - the second at 4 AM! They are open 24 hours - what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"When I'm in Laval and want to visit somewhere that give me that good old fashioned diner atmosphere, this is the place I frequent.    They are best known for their smoked meats and brisket.  The also have pizza, burgers, poutine's and many other sandwiches and starters.    Lastly, this place has a bunch of deserts and they all look fantastic.   I typically go for the mini desserts and the chocolate cake is the bomb!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service and food were very good. We shared the smoked meat plate. Enough meat and bread to make two reasonable sandwiches. Will be back."}
{"text":"a good plate of spaghetti bolognese served in 5 minutes with lot of sauce at 2AM!! fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great hamburger and fries. Waiter was not to attentive... and the place was not packed. Nice that is near the Scotiabank theater. Desserts were ok."}
{"text":"C'est grâce au gentil personnels de chez Dunn's Laval que j'ai pu avoir un gâteau au fromage pour notre souper de Noël   Merci beaucoup à Patrick - ce petit geste simple est grandement apprécié   Contrairement au dunn's montreal qui a refusé de me vendre un gâteau parce que l'hôtesse voulait s'en garder une pointe pour plus tard meme si Jai du aller à Laval je suis ultra reconnaissante.  En plus il est super bon comme gâteau"}
{"text":"I saw a bunch of negative reviews on here, so went out of my way to post a positive one. I remember coming here as a kid when I used to go to the theatre, and took my niece there tonight before Les Mis. The food was great. What seemed like hand cut fries, with a generous portion of chicken fingers for her, and a triple decker tuna melt that comes with avocado on it for me..   They split a milkshake for us for dessert. The server was quick and efficient, we were seated quickly.. I am not sure about all of the complaints but the only one I agree with is the cost- a $60 meal including tip for what we got isn't great. Our drinks were a gingerale and 2 diet cokes.."}
{"text":"The staff is the one star. The food is horrible not to mention the food poisoning my mother had from eating the rotten fish they served her. She literally took two bites and realized the smell coming from the food was not normal. She was violently ill for 3 days. I wouldn't recommend eating here ever.   The owner has reached out to me and was apologetic. The fish is frozen deep fried and she adamant that age does not believe it could have been the root of the issue. I still whole heartedly believe it was. She as well offered a free meal for me and a guest. Although I declined and will still not return it's nice to know that she cares about her business."}
{"text":"I grabbed a quick bit here before going to see a play. I had the tuna melt instead of the traditional smoke meat sandwich. This was served with fries, slaw and a crunchy pickle. Meh tuna melt was OK. Fries and slaw were pretty good. Pickle... I am not sure how you could screw up a pickle so it was OK. All in all the meal was OK.  Price was about 15.00 which is standard in this area.  Service was fine and the atmosphere was nice.  Would I go back?... Yes probably."}
{"text":"Should really be a 3.5 Star.  There around 10pm last night, place is pretty dear like the rest of the town on a Tuesday night.  Had their\"famous poutine\".   Nice portion... For $14++, it better be nice portion!!! What shall I say, taste like fries with gravy and smoke meat topping.  Nothing special, longing at it in a positive way, not bad. Worth the$14?  You pay for the central downtown eating....  Maybe you get a bit more vibe over the weekend."}
{"text":"Pros - Smoked meat was quite tasty  Cons - Decor was all shotti and clearly painted/furnished half ass - My chicken club was very dry - Service was super slow - I felt like I was paying for the brand and not the quality of the food.  Conclusion: I'd go there for late night munchies over Chenoy's but I don't see another reason why I'd find myself there. This doesn't deter me at all from going to the downtown location."}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars because the food is great and affordable, but when the service sucks it ruins the experience.  I think we had the only crabby waiter in the restaurant.   No smiles, no small talk, rushed through everything, just plain old cranky."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but after we received the MOST terrible service ever at Dunn's I felt I needed to write this one. The food was delicious - we had the smoked meat poutine and a regular poutine - but our server was rude to the point of it being almost unbelievable. It was unfortunate as we were looking forward to tucking in, watching the Habs game and having a nice night out as a family - but the service was so terrible we had our poutine and left. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Wow. Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere.   Me and a few friends came by here after a bachelor party, looking to get some classic Montreal smoked meat sandwiches. I've heard great things about Dunn's but this was my first time going. Even though it was a large group, we were accommodated & seated fairly quickly, and the food didn't take long to come out either. Montreal has a bunch of great places to eat & this is a classic spot you need to come by.  Recommendations :  REUBEN   Smoked meat, swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Thousand Islands dressing. Served on pumpernickel bread with homemade fries, coleslaw and dill.  The amount of meat on this sandwich was insane. Definitely a filling and something I would have again   Thanks again to everyone at Dunn's for an amazing experience"}
{"text":"a little salty not bad taste  Good service  If friends ask me where is the best place for poutine &smoked meat I will come here next time"}
{"text":"I was looking for a diner to grab some food and kill some time before a show. I had low expectations, given that I was right in the middle of downtown on a Sunday night, when it seemed like I might end up at a restaurant that is more typically found in a mall.  Obviously this isn't a fancy place, but it's a great spot for some delightful diner vibes and loitering. The servers were super friendly (not like diners back home!). The food was fast and pretty good. Obviously I got the smoked meat, because what else are you there for?  I'm not sure if I lucked out on the quality of the people watching opportunities or if it's always this good (there's another Yelp review mentioning post-bachelor party smoked meat, so maybe this is the type of tourists this place draws in). While I was happy with the food and the overall experience, the people watching made it great."}
{"text":"While I tend to mostly just end up in places during my Montreal visits, I always make it a point to go to Dunn's. The fact that it's 24-hours makes that easy. However I am SUPER PISSED that the peppercorn poutine (Poutine Parisienne) is not on the menu anymore.   While I still will come here, I won't look forward to it as much. I used to have dreams about that poutine."}
{"text":"Great service - the Super Combo was delicious and fast friendly service. So glad to see this place when I come to Canada so I don't have to go downtown when I'm staying in Laval. A must stop when I am in Canada and will be back again."}
{"text":"When your girlfriend/boyfriend asks you what you're craving and you don't know, well just say smoked meat and bring them here and say that a yelper gave that advice!!!!!   It shows in the name of the restaurant, \"Dunn's FAMOUS\" !!! Yes it is a known place for its smoked meat! And yes you should try it out! The atmosphere depicts the taste of smoked meat. The food is really good, the fries are just right, homemade ! The meat was not too dry. May be crowded at lunch time. The staff was almost emotionless, but the service was correct and adequate. But hey! I came here for the food! So you should too!"}
{"text":"The brisket was delicious. I had mine on the bagel sandwich which was very good. My fiance had the   Beef burrito which was just OK. I would probably stick to the items they are known for.  The hand cut fries were definitely a plus. The place was very busy but the service was relatively quick.   If you are in downtown Montreal this is definitely a staple to stop at."}
{"text":"So happy we found this gem while visiting this wonderful city. The combinations of flavors are mouth watering and just when you thought you couldn't fit anything else in your tummy...they have mini desserts, so you can enjoy a sweetie without bursting the dam. We will definitely be back before we depart."}
{"text":"Had the smoked meet with a side of poutine (had to go with the whole experience). Good smoked meat, although I've had better.  The service was good, but very slow."}
{"text":"Omg the Montreal smoked meat is as good as it gets here.  The meat was moist and not overly salty, and I got the medium fat and it was perfect. Imagine if the corned beef and the pastrami had the perfect baby. It was that good.  Service was good, and our drinks were refilled without asking.  The poutine was good, but the smoked meat was even better... did I mention it was amazingly good?  During our stay in Montreal, we tried 4 other places who supposedly had great smoked meats.  I would come back to Dunn's in a heartbeat, and best of all... they are open 24/7"}
{"text":"Checked out this place on the 13th, I had the chicken honey mustard salad without chicken lol but it was actually soooo good! The amount of \"toppings\" added to the salad was awesome - most restaurant just give mostly lettuce and it's disappointing. My fiancé had the bacon cheddar burger with mushrooms and smoked meat poutine. He liked it and said he would rate it 3.5. I would give a 4. So overall for tonight's visit we give 3.5-4."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint. The kids menu had lots to offer, the server friendly and professional, and of course the smoked meat was extremely good.  I had a Reuben, and it came accompanied by a tasty sweet Cole slaw and dill. Not too much sauce on the sandwich, and the cheese and sauerkraut were just enough flavours to be good company for the meat.  I upgraded the fries to poutine and was rewarded with a decent bowl. My wife didn't like the gravy but I thought it was fine. The cheese were proper curds, not the shredded garbage you find in Toronto.  The desserts looked delectable and so I had a mini cheesecake, a perfect size to get a taste without over filling. The kids split a warm cookie, which came with a vanilla ice cream. The warm cookie didn't disappoint, and went perfectly with the ice cream.  On top of great food and great service was a friendly,  fun vibe. It made an impression on our son, who lived his pizza and kept talking about coming back for another visit."}
{"text":"-casual atmosphere -The poutine is a must. This was my favorite poutine in Montreal! We had the basic poutine with cheese curds and gravy, I could not stop eating it!  -If you are looking for a classic  montreal meal and want a smaller portion. I suggest splitting the smoked meat sandwich and upgrade your fries to poutine. This is a perfect sized lunch for two people.  -the smoked meat sandwich was just as good as Schwartz's without the long wait. This is something you must eat while in Montreal.  -Our server was friendly and checked up on us an appropriate amount of times.  -My only negative is that the tables are a little too close together. You can easily dive into the conversation of the people sitting next to you."}
{"text":"When I travel I want to eat in a local place, not a chain or a tourist trap.  We were in the business district within walking distance of Old Town, Chinatown and museums and asked the front desk for a local restaurant.  Dunn's they said, a local chain with good food and good prices.  They were right about that!  Think NYC Jewish deli meets 24 Jersey diner with big menu at good prices.  Smoked meat is a Canadian obsession and theirs is an excellent example.  Moist, lightly smoked brisket on rye with fries, slaw and a pickle, who could ask for more?  Sorry, no Dr. Brown's soda.  This is not Texas smoked, but milder with great flavor and tenderness.  The menu covers just about everything including pizza and poutine, fries, cheese curds and gravy plus multitudes of variations.  Didn't try it on this trip, but poutine is another obsession, right up there with hockey.  My daughter had a medium burger which she said was correctly cooked, juicy and flavorful.  They, like most of the restaurants in our trip had at least a beer and wine license.  Hear that Jersey?  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Stopped here to try Poutine on our Montreal vacation.  Poutine was delicious with lots of cheese curds.  Pudding Choumeur was on my Montreal food bucket list so tried that for dessert as well.  Extremely rich and sweet."}
{"text":"OMG! OMG! Poutine to the umpthess! holly molly this was amazesballz. the gravy was delicious, the fries were just right and the freaking smoked meat, uh yes sir, piled on top enough for two people to share and not get all pissy that someone ate to much."}
{"text":"Came across this place at Fashion Week. I had the soup of the day (chicken noodle, yay!) which was good. Also had chicken angel hair pasta, which was okay as well. Tried some of my friend's calamari, that was good and I really liked the dipping sauce. Their service is great - the girl was super friendly and answered all my questions (and even offered to customize my pasta to fit my preference). Service was quick (although we went around 6, so there wasn't TOO many people).  Food is alright all around - nothing fancy but still enjoyable. I'd say the price is slightly high for the quality of food, but I'd go again for a quick & simple eat."}
{"text":"Pros: they have a large menu, the serve tongue sandwiches, and it's not too busy at lunch. Cons: the borscht was cabbage based, and so kind of bad; they selection of mustard was too small (only generic yellow mustard and a rather processed dijon mustard); the service was also lacking.  Overall, it's not a great place, but the menu is large enough that it might warrant returning if there is nowhere else nearby to go."}
{"text":"The food is just okay but it's a Montreal institution so it is worth going to after a night out.  Smoked Meat Sandwich - Not impressive but this is what they are known for and this is your cup of tea, then more power to you. Personally, I found it a bit bland though it was easy to eat.   Poutine - This was much better. Completely unhealthy but a hearty option."}
{"text":"Our concierge at the Marriott suggested Dunn's as a place to grab a good smoked meat. This is a quintessential deli. No frills but very good food. We split the smoked meat poutine. It was delicious. It had just the right amount of gravy. the meat and fries, combined with the great cheese curds made an excellent shared appetizer. The smoked meat sandwich was great and flavorful, with yellow deli mustard only and rye bread. A classic deli sandwich that I recommend. Everyone enjoyed their food.  Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Perfect location near downtown hotels and one of a few places open late night. A server and general manager from another restaurant it after their kitchen closed.   I enjoyed the poutine and an Irish coffee. Reasonable prices and a wholesome, diner feel.   Only reason it wasn't 5 stars was that the service was slow initially getting a menu and ordering. It was somewhat busy for the early morning/late evening."}
{"text":"Nouvelle place que j'ai découverte cette nuit avec mes amies on revenais d'un soirée de lutte à st hyacinthe belle ambiance service numéro #1 bon choix au menu bon prix jai adore ca"}
