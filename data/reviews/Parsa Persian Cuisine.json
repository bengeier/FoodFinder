{"text":"Yelpers... how did this place get 5 or even 4 stars?  Came here Friday night because of the Groupon deal.  
We arrived 6ish, and when i got up to get food... there was little to none left in most of the trays.  All the kebob trays were empty, i couldn't  find any meat and the selection was just horrible.  The only thing that was full,  was 3 trays of rice.  This is this first time, in a buffet, that i actually had more veggies than meat on my plate.

Went back to my table and started to eat and chew.  This is the first time i have used the term chew, this is an indication of the quality of the food.  

I hear the kitchen door open and my head popped  up like a groundhog coming up out of the ground. I flew  out of my seat and literally ran to where the guy was putting food down.  When i got there,  he only placed 7 rolls of kebabs!  I grabbed 3 right away and returned to my seat.  It was average at best.

I sat there and waited  and waited and waited some more.   Each time the kitchen door opened, my head would snap upwards to see what was coming out.  The door opened about 10 times over a 15min period,  and food was only brought out twice.  Kebabs  once and the other time was what looked liked grilled tomatoes  to me.   

I have seen people take pic of chicken kabobs  and beef kabobs and many other food items but,  today was really bad.   There was nothing left and nothing much came out at all.

Will I come back... not even if it was free."}
{"text":"i should have listened to the other reviewers.  Like many who bought. supposedly good deal from Groupon, the four pf us went on Sat. for lunch when they opened at 12:30,  The food was pitiful.  Some looked like heated up leftovers.  Only one meat dish, i.e., chicken with some sauce.  No kebabs apparently because they were not ready.  Why won't you have it ready at opening.  Even at the deal of $30 for 4, it wasn't worth it.  What a ripoff."}
{"text":"I am struggling to understand the reviews I read on Yelp for this place. We got there around 6pm on a Saturday, the buffet bar had a lot of empty foodtrays with burnt looking scraps in it and they were not getting refilled. No kabobs which is supposed to be the star of the buffet - the wait staff went in the kitchen to bring 2 beef kabobs for us. No utensils were readily available and on top of that, the food we did get to eat was just meh. Dessert was also only ice cream. Very disappointing. The only plus - the server was attentive in getting us what we needed. We went to grab a slice of pizza after."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and a great variety. What really sets this place apart is the amazing service and the good price."}
{"text":"Went to this place last week on a Friday. I had a goupon and i know i would be running later so I called before and they said the buffet was open till 11pm. 
I got there at 8pm and they only had rice, salad and beef kabob.  I was very disappointed that the photos here show its a buffet however the was only a handful of items to select from. I would hate to paying regular price. 
Never going back!"}
{"text":"I eat Persian food all the time. I LOVE their kebobs and feseejan. Naturally I became curious when a Persian buffet opened up. 

It was quiet when we arrived. The owner made some koobideh just for us. They were good. It's good that the kebobs are not pre-made and left on the tray. Kebobs are best when they are fresh. 

They also have stews. It's a buffet so as expected, they are a more watery version of what you'd normally get. The taste for all the stews isn't what it should be but they are still edible. The feseejan didn't have much meat but it was still good. 

Overall, it was alright. If you want to try a bunch of different Persian stews at the same time, then come here. They don't have the \"higher\" cuts of meat here. You're coming here for variety. If you want quality stews, you need to go elsewhere. Would I come again? Probably. It's really great value at $12.99."}
{"text":"First time here. I came for the all you can eat buffet and I have to say you get a great bang for your buck! Its $12.99 regardless if its a weekend or a weekday. Lunch or dinner (though they did mention that this is an introductory price and that it might go up). They have great selection of home cooked Persian dishes. Kebab, Tikka, Samousa and others I can't pronounce! They all tasted great except for the French fries which were OK nonetheless but tasted more like pre-packaged fries rather than freshly cut fries. They had a nice selection of salads. Their ice cream flavors are vanilla, strawberry, mango, and chocolate. They served us complimentary sweets and tea. If you want to try a bit of multiple Persian dishes then this place is right for you."}
{"text":"Odd sort of buffet. It's not a big buffet. There aren't islands and islands covered in food. Just kind of a salad bar and then a row of hot plates. That being said, the food is pretty decent. The salad bar is reasonable. The veggies are fresh. There's dolmades, which I found interesting. There are three kinds of rice (plain, lentils?, dill with fava beans?) and if you're lucky, they have tah deeg, which is kinda like rice that was on the bottom of the cooking pot that got all crispy. Then there's gormeh sabzi (spinach-y, herb-y stew with beans, preserved lemons and chunks of beef. looks nasty but when done right, tastes good. this one was a tad too lemony, but not bad), some bean and beef stew, some okra stew, some celery and beef stew, and some walnut and pommegranate stew (this one I would have never guessed had the owner not told us). There was also roasted veggies (eggplant and zucchini were unidentifiable but delicious, and tomato which actually had proper char marks), some kind of chicken stew that looks like a curry but doesn't taste like curry at all, some kind of chicken breast in tomato sauce, three kinds of soup (something with noodle, pumpkin and something that looked like lentil curry) and some kind of flat bread.
 
Stars of the night were the kebabs. Yes, they take time to cook (10 minutes?) Yes, the amount is small when they bring them out. Upside, they're hot, fresh and absolutely delicious. They're also tender and juicy. They have ground beef (shish?) and grilled chicken. Yum.

Ah. They had ice cream for dessert, but seeing as it was -15 degrees outside and the restaurant is cold (the inside of the door had ice on it), I opted out of dessert.

Odd things. They hand you a plate and a bowl. You reuse those. Cutlery is self-serve. So is seating. As someone else mentioned, the knives are paring knives. Drinks...eventually, someone might ask you what you want to drink.. You pay at the counter.

TV choice for the night was Treehouse. The owner's son is like 3 years old, so I'm guessing that's why.

Very few people tonight, so my family got first dibs on kebabs all night long!

More odd things. This time about service signs. There are signs on some of the tables saying that maximum eating time is 35 minutes and that you're limited to 3 plates. That being said, there were no people and we stayed for almost an hour and a half. They also didn't (and couldn't) keep track of the number of plates we had.

I too, had a groupon, and so all I ended up paying was tax (on the original amount, not only the groupon), and tip, which seemed optional (as I didn't see a tip jar and we paid at the counter).

I'm not the biggest fan, but I'd come back for the food. I mean, with the groupon (I still have the 2 person one and I plan on using it), it's $7.50/person plus tax and possible tip. For the kebabs, it's totally worth it. That and the owner (the man) is super friendly and extremely helpful. I'm a little Chinese girl who knows the names of her two favorite Persian dishes. He helped describe the rest to us before we ate. He also did this for another group of people who came in."}
{"text":"The ratings on Yelp for Parsa are deceiving. Went here with my girlfriend and the food was simply not good. Most of the dishes we tried were under seasoned had very little punch to them and where generally lack lustre. Most palatable dish was the kebabs which were tasty but chewy and greasy. They use paring knives as cutlery that seemed to come from the dollar store, boxed tissue for napkins, and serve tepid water. The over all cleanliness is questionable, the strange off putting stains around the cooler the holds the ice cream would have been enough to stop you there but for good measure the scoop beside it was covered in a layer of strange milky foam. The washroom to put it gently was a mess with nothing to dry your hands with not even a tissue, I could has used some toilet paper that was nicely placed on the back of the toilet (if that doesn't say class I don't know what does."}
{"text":"Five of us came to surprise one of ours with his 50th birthday gifts.  My very critical friend, Alex, both praised and ridiculed the restaurant immediately.  He loved the comfort of their leather parson's chairs but joked about the \"35 minute eating limit\" sign posted on our table.  Jeff and Eric very much enjoyed the soup appetizer commenting on the thickness thereof which prompted an argument as to when a soup graduates to a stew.  Alex, the most argumentative of the bunch, remained strangely silent.  
I, too, enjoyed the soups, combing all three into one bowl.  They were thick enough that they did not co-mingle.  I respect that in a soup/stew.  However, my admiration for Parsa's appetizers ended there.  I found the salad bar disappointing - not much there.  Shouldn't there be hummus, labaneh and other dips to eat with the chopped tomato/cucumber salad?
The main courses included kebabs and beef in sauces with beans and other good sides.  We enjoyed these.  But, Al commented on the absence of knives in the cutlery tray.  While I'm all in favour of fewer knives in the middle east, in general, I would exempt middle eastern restaurants from this particular prohibition.
The desserts were just lacking - only ice cream and some dry coffee cake.  More was needed.
The owner/manager was very pleasant and helped us clean up all the gift wrapping when we surprised Eric with his gifts - a director's chair and swag from the upcoming Hashmok film.
A good time was had by all.  Four of used a Groupon and the shared the discount with the fifth.  I don't believe Parsa can expect people to pay the full $15 price.  The buffet just isn't big enough.
Oh, they had a TV and the Raptors were playing but it was not turned on.  We were having enough fun chatting that we never asked for the game."}
{"text":"I had gone to a few Persian buffet restaurants  with my Persian friends before  Parsa Persian Cuisine. I have to admit that it is the best buffet  I've ever been to and all the foods were delicious and well cooked. I will go there again. I've gone there 10 times since opening  with my Persian friends so far.

I have read some reviews about this restaurant that it is not a big buffet or there are not enough islands,  Well it is a small size and cozy restaurant not a large size but the food is fresh and the manager is very polite, friendly,  and responsible. I saw him trying to make the guests happy there."}
{"text":"Found a deal on Groupon so decided to visit the restaurant. There was a long wait, till we got our table and when we started eating, we realized why there were so many people lined up. 

The food was amazing good, service a but slow but the food compensated for the slightly slow service. The owner explained that the kebabs were best consumed hot so they only made a limited quantity. He was very polite and apologized that due to a promotional price that was just introduced for a limited time, they are experiencing a high volume, which is why service was slow.

I have eaten Persian food at many establishments, some with a better ambiance, but if you want to compromise on the ambiance and just enjoy good authentic Persian food, this is the place to go.

They have a huge array of kebabs which are slow cooked on a charcoal grill which gives its distinctive and unique flavor. However, they have only one of chicken and one of beef kebab type that  they serve each day. You can ask for additional delicacies on the ala-carte which are not included in the buffet like their lamb kebabs which simply melt in your mouth.

A must visit for connoisseurs of authentic Persian / Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I came here with my 3 friends for the first time. We knew about their all you can eat buffet deal from Yelp, so we decided to see if we get the deal's worth. Finding a parking spot was a bit of a headache in the little Persian plaza as all spots were taken. We arrived around 1:30 PM and kept wondering where the kabob is for about an hour! Baghali polo is my friend's favourite food and of course they didn't have any today. After requesting the kabob a couple of times, the waiter told us that he will be bringing some soon. 

I pretty much tried a bit of everything including different salad items, kookoo sabzi, loobia polo, the various stews and ice cream (their only desert) and I must say the quality was pretty good. Heads up if you like kabob barg like I do: they don't have barg kabob as part of the buffet unfortunately.

 After the manager came, things improved gradually. The chicken kabob and koobideh came in and we were served complimentary Ahmed tea, which is truly aromatic and appealing. They also served zoolbia-bamieh, a super sweet Persian desert that compliments the tea.

4 stars for great customer service from the manager (he's got awsome people's skills), the chicken kabob and of course for gladly accepting our yelp coupon. How they can improve: add more kabob!"}
{"text":"A gourmet selection of persian cuisine. Really the only one of its kind and worth a try for sure. For the price,  cant go wrong whether you're on the run, want take out or simply craving a well made yet reasonably priced kabab.  
Dont miss their kookoo sabzi with rorshi :D"}
