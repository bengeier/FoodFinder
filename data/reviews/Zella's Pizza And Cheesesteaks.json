{"text":"Being that I live in the west valley now, there are little to no mom-n-pop delivery shops to choose from, Zella's is a friendly name that I remember. After ordering from them for over a year now, I think I have my final consensus.   Overall, I don't know why I keep coming back to Zella's. I've had some pretty shitty phone service, but I guess I like their food enough to put up with it. PLEASE, if anything, Zella's, learn to be more courteous on the phone!  Please be aware that my review is based only on delivery. (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  + Good food. I love their boneless wings. Best flavor from any pizza/wing place in Arizona to date (for me). I usually get regular wings because no one likes wimpy wings aka boneless, but I love the Zella's boneless. They've hardly ever messed up my orders, although I'd say the boneless wings can come smaller than normal, and you never know what you'll get. I once got the usual 10, but each \"wing\" was about 1/2\" in size.   - Waiting. OMG sometimes I wait an hour and a half for my food. Usually they let me know about the wait and are honest with how long it will be, but damn, maybe hire some more people for busy nights? It's been like this since I started ordering from here over a year ago.  -/+ Service. Typically I've had very lousy service on the phone. Twice it was one hour from their closing time and they told me they would not deliver. THIS is what makes me order from a large corporate chain. If they say they close at 9, and you call at 8:45, your order will STILL be delivered. I also had one lady DEMAND my building number (albeit I should know my building number, but no one has ever denied delivery without a building number) and so I hung up and ordered Papa John's. According to her she \"wasn't going to send her driver out there with no building number.\" Um, they have to look at the map anyway, get over it. HOWEVER, my delivery service has always had pleasant drivers. One girl even gave me extra ranch (shout out to you, girl!).  + Prices. For delivery (and usually if it's fried), this place is pretty good. Good portions and I don't spend more than I would at a corporate chain.  -/+ Coupons. Sure, if you want pizza and wings, you can get some good deals. If you want subs or anything else, probably not your best bet. And to my knowledge, their \"deals\" have always been the same."}
{"text":"My son who is 11 just tried the gluten free pizza and said it was the best that he has had.  I have had the regular pizza md it was really good.  The customer service was awesome here.  We can't wait to try the sandwhiched next time.  I highly suggest Zella's."}
{"text":"I am picky about burgers. So when I saw burgers on the pizza menu. I was like we'll let's try it. They have great salad an pizza. This burger did not disappointe  it was really good, an you build it how you like it. I will be back. Yummy"}
{"text":"Great customer service!! We arrived around 7pm on a Monday night.  The cashier was very helpful with the menu.  We asked if they had a children's menu but she mentioned they did not. We have a 18 month old so we were a little disappointed.     When our food arrived she had brought a piece of chopped chicken along with our order and said she had the cook make a special order for our daughter.   We were super stoked!! She went out if her way just for us.   It made our evening. As we know with kids it can make or break an evening night out.  A HUGE thank you to who ever she was.  We will definitely be back and share this with others.  The food was great too!  We ordered a couple of Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches and buffalo fries.  The bread for the subs was soft and moist and the meat not dry and juicy.   The fries were steak fries backed with buffalo chicken sauce with the perfect amount of cheese.  They were very hot too, nothing worse than getting cold cheese fries.    We highly recommend this place.  Especially for the customer service."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations and they are both great. I give this store an extra rating cause the service was crazy fast. The New York style and toasted sub is a must"}
{"text":"Geno's, Buddy's, now Zella's?????.  I've tried all with much disappointment.  Pretty much the same cheap menu of all 3 and familiar faces working there.  So I do not doubt same owner(s) probably trying to take advantage of some tax loop hole by creating a new business with same menu to attempt to fix their past failures in business.  Here is a free tip... change the menu!!!! the food is poor quality and all grease.  I am really surprised it has any good reviews but I assume similar to the common problem plaguing Amazon that it must be paid reviews, coerced employees, or friends/family.  I tend to only want to write positive reviews but couldn't hold back given my recent experience.  I really wanted to like this place given the location but every time I piece together they probably opened with a new name I am disappointed the quality is always the same and I pay for later."}
{"text":"The prices are great and the food is really great ! I had the hamburger for 6$ the garlic fries were a little pricy for the small portion but still good , the hamburger was really tasty and satisfying . Leah served me and she was really kind and funny, great service , great food and deals :)"}
{"text":"I got the steak, mushroom and provolone sandwich with a salad and it was very good! I had it delivered to my work which is about 4 mi away and hard to find. The driver was very nice and  I had them deliver again today! I'm glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I ordered food here online. Given an estimated time for the order, I arrive at the time, and waited over a half hour for it to be ready, with no employees even apologizing. Terrible service will never buy from here again."}
{"text":"Low prices for great food! Delivery is fast too. Their chicken wings are excellent. Pizza is only $5 and a lot better quality (and much bigger) than little ceasars."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service!! I would highly recommend this place.Cheesesteaks are on point, as close to Philly as I've had.Great job"}
{"text":"Yummy cheese steak! Pizzas were great tasting. Go for cheese steak!! Wish we had ordered more of those!!"}
{"text":"I love this place the service is great.  The staff is friendly and always makes me laugh when I go in.  I love the fried zucchini and the sub's and pecan sale are the best.  I would recommend this place if you're on this side of town."}
{"text":"So I've had yelp or some time and never had made a review, I had to put up a review cause this place need ms to be known, I ordered a $5 large pepperoni with garlic crust, I was skeptical about the pizza only because of the past few places, I have to say I couldn't believe that it was so fresh and tasteful, from reading some reviews and checking the place out I can see why, they make pretty much everything from scratch, good job guys it really shows in the product. They were up selling the toasted subs and baked fries, I will definitely have to try on my next visit, staff is friendly and it seems as this is a new chain based out of Arizona. My new go to place."}
{"text":"Always are go to for good and reasonably priced pizza. Recommend the buffalo chicken pizza. Cheesesteak sandwiches are bomb too!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Zella's because it was so close to home and advertised Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches.  I can't remember the names of the two sandwiches, but one cheesesteak had provolone and the other had cheese wiz.  My husband and I were left unimpressed.  The sandwiches were light on meat, light on flavor and the bread was all wrong.  We are still searching for a good Philly Cheesesteak close to home.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered over an hour ago for delivery. 12 inch sub , wings, fried mushrooms, still no food. Pathetic on a Thursday."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, horrible delivery service, and just overall ridiculous and pathetic. I can't speak to the food because after my scheduled order was two hours late and the customer service was so terrible, I sent my food back. I actually downloaded yelp just for the sake of writing this review because of the way I was treated and the service was so bad.  Do not patronize this establishment, don't waste your time or money, and find somewhere less awful."}
{"text":"We are at Zellas all the time. The food is always good. I love the pizza and so does my entire family. I have steadily been trying everything on the menu and have never been dissapointed.  The staff is always friendly.  I just tried their deep dish and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place they always deliver on time my driver was  Brian V he's always got a great attitude and great customer service skills :-)"}
{"text":"Morning shift people are great...... always have my orders on time...food is always hot and delicious..."}
{"text":"Wow! This spot is amazing. Toasted subs are on point.   Gotta have that deep dish though!! Lunch pizza specials, oh boy can't beat them. Reminds me of genos that was in the same spot before but way better these guys know what they're  doing. No wonder they took it over."}
{"text":"The honey got wings were great and the pizza was fire. Definitley coming back for more. The online ordering was easy and my bill wasn't unreasonable. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I'm out here visiting from jersey (Burlington) The steak and mushroom was the bomb. I didn't add the special sauce and added extra cheese and mayo. I meant to take a pic but I ate it without breathing. Very impressed :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pizza and food around.  Meatza Pizza with the work and seasoned crust is a must. Have not had a single thing here that didn't make me crave for more. Great service, love the fact that this place is family owned and operated. Great service and a friendly and amazing staff."}
{"text":"When we ordered we got two sandwiches, fries, Greek fries, bread sticks, soda and a pizza. The first issue was my girlfriend ordered with an out of state phone number and they almost refused to let us order.   Took 20 minutes to place an order. They didn't have any diet soda of any kind. When we got the food the sandwiches were soggy and bland. I asked for no onions but they were still on it anyway. The pizza reminded me if I would have gotten Pizza Hut, kept it on the counter for three days and then microwaved it. It was horrible.   The breadsticks were hard and stale tasting and the fries were very limp. It's almost as I'd they just reheated old fries instead of making us new ones. Needless to say I am never getting this pizza again."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by the food here. Wings were awesome! Foot long slice was delicious New York style... And the Famous Philly with cheese whiz was just like the real thing. We're definitely coming again and again for now on."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome!!!!The Customer service was phenomenal.The person who took my order was named Vanessa and she was very helpful.I told her my needs were and she not only sold me the pizzas I needed for my party but also sandwiches and salads.Needless to say my party was a success and everyone loved the Food Thank you Zellas and thanks to Vanessa for helping make my party successful!!!!!"}
{"text":"Order from here at least once a week, the sandwiches are always great and I really enjoy the baked fries. The pizza is always a good choice too!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for the money. Bought a few for the kids and got hooked ourselves. Flavored crust and a good herby sauce along with some nice meaty wings keep us coming back."}
{"text":"On 9-15-17 we ordered pizza, wings, & a philly chs steak!  They were pretty busy, but all the food was hot, cooked correctly, and the customer service was outstanding!  Kenny, Jenae - Thank you !"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times since the location re-opened a few weeks ago under new owners and, wow! What an improvement! Having been to the previous two businesses as well, I have to say that this is the best, by far.  The staff is super friendly and very customer focused. I was pleasantly surprised by their vegetarian options as well as their gluten free options. They will happily comply to most any request from what I can tell (ie: please no chicken on my buffalo chicken fries). The place is very clean (bathrooms too!) and the environment is family oriented. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I have called the owner 3 times about them posting coupons on my front door and have not received a call back. They use the cheapest tape possible on their coupons and the sun bakes it on my door knob. Owner refuses to call me back or stop posting on my door. Poor customer service. I have actually eaten here a few times and the food is not bad. I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"*Update-  I received a call today from Jeff the manager to apologize for the girl that took my order.  She was new and they got busy!! Hey things happen!! His apology was more than enough to ensure our family will be coming back!! On another note the pizza was really good!! Had no leftovers at all!!   Looking forward to trying this I heard it was good. Only thing I would say is DUDE train your phone people.. She did not give me much confidence that I'm going to get what I ordered and she actually repeated my Credit Card number out loud expiration and all.. I hope no one unsavory over heard that.. Ugh!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't cut a 24 inch pizza and has rude ladies answering their phones? This place does!  At first I really liked it there - but today shows how well they deal under pressure.  Last week we ordered and they forgot the ranch - spoke to Eli and said no worries ill put it on your account for next time - called today and the lady said well I can't give you the ranch if it's not noted on your account!  Ended up giving me two out of the 4 for free that I had paid for in the first place.  Also took an hour and a half for them to deliver the pizza.  For the non cut pizza and inconvenience of cutting it ourselves didn't offer a credit for next time or anything.  Good food but crappy customer service!"}
{"text":"This is our first time ordering from this place and the experience was not good. Normally I like to try new places and don't like to judge until I try it.The food was good but the customer service was not. Pizza took two hours to be delivered. When my niece called to ask why it was taking so long, they said \"it's not like your the only one that's waiting two hours!\" And then hung up on her, when this is coming from the manager of the establishment I think that there is something very wrong. As a person that works in a restaurant which is customer service I think they are up for their yearly training."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been ordering from this location for months now and each time the delivery service is getting worse. Im at the point that i will not order from then anymore and will not tell anyone of my family or friends to order from them ever after today. I ordered their $25 coupon of 2 large 2 topping pizzas and 20 wings today. I placed this order at 12:35 pm and as told it would take an hour for delivery(which seemed a bit excessive at this time of day. Since it was after lunch rush). So as the hour mark came and then went the order was still not here. At 20 minutes after the hour it was still not here, so I called them to ask where my order was since its now been an hour and 20 minutes. The girl on the phone proceeds to go on to tell me that the order was out for delivery and quickly got off the phone. So again I sat outside waiting and again another 10 minutes went by and no order. I called back again and this time the girl put me on hold to see where the delivery girl was at. She came back on the line and tried to tell me that there was traffic that delayed the driver and that she was less then 5 minutes away. Now that began to irritate me since they are only 3 miles from where I live. There's not that much traffic that would delay a delivery by 30 minutes. The girl just kept saying she was sorry and never offered up any comps of any kind to show any customer appreciation to keep me as a customer. I then asked her what they were going to do to compensate me for not having my food by an hour and a half. She then says oh well I can give you a $10 credit on your account for your next order. I said fine and hung up expecting my order in under 5 minutes as they claimed. Well that was a lie yet again as it took the driver an additional 12 minutes to finally show up. So now its been an hour and 42 minutes; the driver got out and acted like nothing was wrong. She asked \"hi how's your day going?\" I responded with \"it would have been better if my order was here over 40 minutes ago, on time.\" She then got very snotty quick and snapped \"well there's only one of me and your total is $30.58.\" I said \"well I would like to check to see if my food was still hot before I pay for it.\" She pulled out one pizza and handed it to me and I checked it. Granted it wasnt as hot as all my other orders from before but it was warm enough that I went ahead and paid for it. I then handed the driver $40 and she said \"let me get your change.\" The change should have been $9.42 she came back and handed me only $9 not even saying sorry I don't have any change, change she just assumed she could keep the 42 cents and hesitated like I was going to give her more for a tip.  Well now I'm seeing red so that's all she got as her tip was the 42 cents she assumed she could just keep and I walked away from her. This whole delivery was the worse experience I have ever had from this place. They acted as though my order didn't matter in any way. They acted like they were irritated with me for being upset for not having my food for over and hour and 40 minutes. It will be awhile before I order from them again if I do decide to."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Just ordered my first cheesesteak from this place and incredible is all I can say. My wife had a veggie and loved it as well. We've had the pizza here before as well and it was also solid but this cheesesteak takes the cake. One of the best I've had in AZ!!!  I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Best affordable pizza around! $5 for a large one item pizza with flavored crust! You can't beat it! So good!!! Sandwiches and wings are great! Gotta try the fried pickles! Awesome service,  great prices!"}
{"text":"I couldn't be more disappointed with the order i made 2 and a half hours ago not even kidding when i say 2 and a half hours i ordered at 10:20 i got my food at exactly  12:58. The food was cold and not even that good despite all the \"good\" reviews. The i tried calling the restaurant to see what was going on with my order taking so long, Andrea F. Answered and was being a little snotty but towards the end of the call she said \"your order should be arriving shortly because it just got sent out\" i called her on her lie when i replied \"what was the name on my order again?\" Then she replied \"well you tell me its your order\" i then asked \"then how do you know my order just left?\" She stayed silent. Over all 2 and a half hours is too long to wait for 2 subs. Not going to order for here again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. Their yelp add says the one topping pizza is only $5 but it is actually $5.99 otherwise no problems. Good place for cheap decent pizza. This place is probably one step above Little Cesars. Almost as good as Costco pizza. One complaint is not enough sauce, next time I'll order extra sauce!"}
{"text":"The food was no good. We stopped in and ordered our food to go and it took like 45 minutes and then when we got home the pizza was cold and the cheesesteak was dry. Overall it was terrible. I have no reason to ever return."}
{"text":"Love, Love the sandwiches!! I had the toasted italian, it was by far one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.. Also had the deep fried zucchini, really good, great portion also fantastic  ranch dressing. Delivery was quick and I received what I ordered.  I live in Prescott wish we had a Zella's here:(  We are going down the hill today and will be eating at Zella's tonight!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, except \"WOW!\" Locally owned franchise with superb service and food that tastes like anything BUT franchise food. The oven baked fries are absolutely delicious; the sandwiches and pizzas are truly enjoyable without the hefty price tags. The owner, Jeff, is an absolute pleasure to deal with, and the staff is friendly and enthusiastic.  Whether dining in, ordering take-out or delivery, each experience has been spot on. The place is super clean and inviting and it smells amazing upon entering the small, but energetic storefront.  I am actually VERY picky when it comes to pizza, subs, and Phiily cheesesteaks, having grown up Back East. Believe it or not, I am quite pleased with all of the aforementioned little bits of heaven. Ask Jeff if you can try a sample of something new and I bet he will oblige with a smile. My husband, friends, and I will be patronizing this local gem for sure!"}
{"text":"I have used yelp for 3 years and never left a bad review but after 2 hours for a pizza, hung up on by the manager, when I called after an hour and a half, driver didn't leave part of our order, called manager and she told me I was a liar and she saw the driver box it, told me manager Adrian Acosta knew about it and I could call tommorow, hung up on me a second time. See for yourself and see if this looks like fresh pizza."}
{"text":"New to the Gilbert area, in the mood for Italian. Cheese pizza was absolutely amazing, salad was very fresh and delicious, buffalo fries were great to top off dinner. Our family will definitely keep coming back for more!!!! THANKS ZELLAS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Zella's on Saturday night on my way home from work.  It was recommended by Yelp.  I got the cheesesteak which was great.  I got a glimpse of the pizza which looked delicious.  I will be picking one up on my way home this Saturday."}
{"text":"Just don't. Don't go here, I never write reviews but then,  I've never had a restaurant send an order two hours late, call me to tell me IT'S MY FAULT BECAUSE THE DRIVER CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW ADDRESSES WORK, and hang up on me when I request a manager. Could not believe it. When we called back to try to speak to a manager again, Rich laughed at what we were attempting to tell him. Seriously, I spent $60 and tipped well. Did. Not. Matter. If you can't find another place with Cheesesteaks, get a taco, or a burger, or literally ANYTHING ELSE."}
{"text":"Usually pizza places are judged by the distance to the customer's home. Zella's is more than that. The taste, consistency and friendly staff makes this our family favorite.  They have enough variety to satisfy my kids, they love the deep dish. Flavored crust is a nice addition.  Cinnamon sticks are a nice edition and demanded by my kids. We don't usually eat in, but the staff is quick to serve and deliver based on time estimates."}
{"text":"This was my roommates and my second time ordering from here. The first time was fantastic! However today was very disappointing.  My roommates and I placed the order at 5:37 pm and at 6:08 I received a call saying they were out of one of the ordered items. We ordered something different, it wasn't a big deal. The food however, wasn't delivered until 7:10. Everything was luke warm at best, one of the toasted subs was so soggy and wet that it was falling apart, one toasted sub was ordered without tomato and it came with tomato, and the zucchini stix were cold.   We were externally unhappy with this entire order and the near hour and a half wait."}
{"text":"Wow just wow! These guys make the most amazing food. The staff has been awesome and always greeted us with a smile.   The food was something to tell your friends about. Been here twice and have tried the Philly sub and the crazy good pizza.   The bread they use and the crust on the pizza is what sets Zellas apart.   A must try place for anyone in the area.   10/10 from us."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check out the restaurant, had their deep dish pepperoni pizza, it was absolutely wonderful I would recommend this place. For me it's all about the taste of the sauce and the dough, they both seem to go very well together, not to much sauce and it had just the right amount of oil combination for my liking.  Met the owner Jeff and he is very personable and talked about how he made his pizza, He is definitely passionate about his establishment and his customers. The staff always asked how everything is and if I needed anything, the place is very clean as were the restrooms.   It has a great feel to it and is in a great location. Next time I will have to try a toasted sub."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza is the best around!! My son can't have gluten and every place we go the pizza isn't very good. We tried it at this Zella's and it's so good (I heard they have a gluten free sandwich that is good too but we haven't tried it yet). The gluten free pizza only around $12 or so which is a great deal for gluten free. Plus the $5 pizzas (for me and the rest of the family that is not allergic) is really good too!! Garlic flavored crust is free to add and it tastes delish. The employees are always nice, the manager is fantastic, and it always looks clean inside. I call my order in and it's ready in about 15 minutes for me to pick up."}
{"text":"Sadly, not so good.  Been to the location in Chandler and thought the food was great. Got the thin and crispy crust, but crust was soggy.  Got the wings plain with sauce on the side, but they were soggy too.  fried zucchini was ok, but looked like they were frozen... Got  cold Italian sandwich and it was just kinda well, gross..Lots of mayo and just not good.  Life is too short to eat bad food."}
{"text":"This place has very good food but one of their policies is absolutely horrible. They have Pizza at $5.99 for a large one topping but the only problem is if you ask for a thin crust it cost you additional four dollars for the same exact pizza with a thin crust. This is the type of situation that will alienate customers and have them not come back, I'm going to discuss it with family and we may never come back."}
{"text":"So a friend and i ordered from here, its  been a while since i ordered pizza, so i was surprised and impressed with my experience.  It was also the firdt time for me with trying new York style pizza, i was not disappointed.  My fire and i got a large new York style pizza eith sausage,pepperoni,  and onion with parmesan breadsticks.  Both were great, the breadsticks were good, but what stood out the most was the pizza. It wasnt greasy and the flavors were great, they all balanced each other out. I highly recommend  this place."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place previously however this time around the experience was not good. I placed an order at 6:30pm and it's now almost 9:30pm and the food has not yet arrived. The delivery guy called me saying he was lost and I gave him directions but still went back to the store because he still couldn't find it. The wait time is awful and the food isn't that great to be waiting 3 hours for delivery."}
{"text":"All I can say is: YUUUMMY!  This is one of my favorite pizza places. We always get their $5 large pizza with Italian sausage with ranch/garlic crust. The crust is better than any other place-- the flavor is amazing. The sauce and toppings are very flavorful and the pizza is always extremely hot and crunchy!! Did I mention, only $5?? Haha what more could you ask for!?  It's affordable enough to buy a couple extra pizzas for my parents before heading home as we don't live close to this place, but the trip is worth it :)  Can't speak for anything other than their pizza (yet) but if you're coming for pizza, I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on Yelp and 1.5 hours later, still no food. Estimated 45-60 minute window was not even close to accurate. Restaurant closes in 20 minutes and yelp status check says order left the restaurant and is on the way. Nothing like eating dinner at 9pm... if at all. Doubting it will actually arrive.    2 hours on the nose and the food arrives! The fries are soggy and cold. The burger was dry with a sprinkling of cheddar cheese. Definitely not worth the wait. The italian sub was warm and would have been good except for it had onions on it even after i requested no onions in the special request section.  The highlight of the order was a yummy brownie and a rice crispy treat. They were both good and large enough to share. Just like you would make at home and not unique but tasty all the same. Bottom line, if you have two hours to spare and feel like marginal food and want to drop 30 bucks, this is the place for you! Next time im going to do the McDonalds drive thru and save some money and the quality might be better or at least the same."}
{"text":"Subs and bread are bomb. Wings and sauce- awesome. Super nice staff and family. My new go-to."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing visit I have ever had. I went in to order a pizza and I ordered a pizza with cheese and pepperoni with EXTRA LIGHT SAUCE and when I got home, it had so much sauce that the cheese slid off the pizza. I called the store immediately and informed the girl that the pizza had way too much sauce and that I couldn't eat it. She told me that they only put 1 scoop of sauce and that they usually put 3. I told her that I couldn't eat it with all that sauce and she told me that there was nothing she could do. I asked to get contact for the owner and that I wanted to complain to the owner and she said she doesn't give out that information and to complain to the web site. I have never been so humiliated and made to feel that my business was not wanted. I think that the word should be spread and the business be penalized for the bad customer service I got."}
{"text":"It was all good until they forgot my order twice. Please don't tell me my pizza will be ready in 5 min and you haven't even put my order in...and don't tell me I just ordered it when I ordered it 45 min before walking out! Your customer service blows...and it's hot as hell inside!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. Always friendly on the phones, they deliver fast, haven't messed up an order once...and their fried pickles are AWESOME. The only way they could get better is to lower the pricing a tad as they do seem to be a little over priced compared to other places."}
{"text":"I was sceptical at first. But after hearing good things from my coworkers we decided to order. I ordered it online. It came in about 50 min. I was very impressed. The subs where hot and delicious. I will be ordering from there more often."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we ordered pizza, it was delicious and we had wonderful service from Oakley.  Can't wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Super delicious; ordered this for delivery tonight.  Had a pizza sub and some wings.  The wings were well done (per my request) and the honey hot sauce was delicious.  The pizza sub was good, kind of panini like.  Also, my delivery service was great...the guy who dropped off my food was extremely polite and helpful.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good pie. Thin crust is best. Love prefers ordering here when I'm I'm hangin at Fox's cigar lounge next door. Quick and courteous."}
{"text":"Wow! Honestly the best pizza I've had! The deep dish is AMAZING!!!! So light yet crispy. Perfect. Oh and the toasted subs! I tried the garlic chicken and it was to die for. My husband got the steak sub and loved every bite. We kept ordering because everything was soooo good! We had the buffalo fries....again, soooo good! And the cinnamon rolls. No matter what you get here you won't be disappointed. In fact you will probably dream about it! :)"}
{"text":"This place is a huge step up for what was here before! The service was excellent. The employees are friendly and attentive. Even came over to our table to make sure everything was good!  I ordered the buffalo sandwich and it was so good. My husband got the Philly sandwich and the garlic fries. Also very good. Definitely pleased with everything and will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Always a minimum of an hour and a half to two hour wait for delivery each time we call.  It's a shame because the food is good, just not good enough for that kind of wait time."}
{"text":"I've been hooked on the veggie sandwich, BUT today I tried the veggie pizza. WOW!  Now I have two favorites."}
{"text":"Good mushroom Philly cheesesteaks. Service leaves some to be desired, and sometimes slow. But generally an OK place with good food."}
{"text":"I never check reviews before I try a place and a good thing I didn't. I just moved to the neighborhood and am looking for that spot that you can go to get good food delivered. Is it cheap yes will I be going back no. I'd rather eat chuck cheese pizza than this place. And that's not talking about the wings. The hot wings were the best part because they were meaty wings but the sauce was horrible they could have just used cholula and got better flavor. My recommendation is skip it order dominos."}
{"text":"Friendly staff Good pizza well stuffed with meat  Would eat there again to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"**please read Zella's unprofessional and untrue response to this review  We used to love Zella's. However their customer service is atrocious and we will never be back. I went to this location on Wednesday to pick up an order for a local school. Instead of 10 pizzas, they had only made 10 slices. Both workers were rude and unhelpful. No one offered to correct the order or make the pizzas needed and they demanded payment without an offer of help. I asked for the manager whose name was Roman and he went and hid in the kitchen.  He did not appear again.  I asked to see a copy of the online order...they could only produce a regular tape receipt and claimed that was the same as the order. After paying a ridiculous amount ($59) for 10 slices of pizza, my husband and I rushed to their competitor, a nearby Little Caesars where they quickly produced the pizzas needed and we were able to get them delivered to the school with 20 minutes left for the students to eat. Do NOT patronize this business as they were rude, unapologetic, and refused to make the pizzas ordered. Local schools and clubs beware! If there is a problem they will not help!  After my terrible experience I have had several friends reach out with their own horror stories!  Please read Zella's response below. Jeff was not there at the time of this incident and has made our whole case about their customer service. We were kind, asked for help, and they refused."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I was excited they had Gluten free bread because I have celiac disease so I was really looking forward to a sub. All bread. . . NO fillings. They charge extra for GF bread and then take away everything in the sandwich.   I can't believe I paid over $10 for this.  I posted a picture so you could all see it for yourself!"}
{"text":"As the avid Pizza lovers we are, we had to give this place 5 stars! Great, friendly service from the moment we walked in and as icing on the cake - The pizza slice my son had was perfectly cooked with a delicious flavor! He even ate the crust (unheard of) We will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"First time trying it out and it did not go well.  I placed my \"pickup\" order at 5:15pm and was told it would be ready in \"20 minutes.\"  Knowing that \"20 minutes\" is just a best estimate, I showed up at the restaurant 25 mins later.  I paid and was told it would be \"right out.\"   At 5:40, another server came to where I was waiting to ask for the name on the order. I told her, she glanced back where the ready orders were being stacked, and told me, \"oh, just about ready!\"  At this point I was annoyed, but I didn't say anything.  It WAS kinda busy.  I understand that kitchens get backed up from time-to-time.    Finally at 6:05pm, I asked one of the servers if my order was close.  It was at that point that we all realized that my order had been given to the wrong customer quite some time ago.   This is not why I'm giving a 1-Star review.  I totally understand that mistakes happen. I am in customer service, so I do my best to be as understanding as I can in these situations.  Here is why I'm giving such a low review:  The poor server tried for 5 minutes to get a manager to come talk to me (at my request).  I wasn't loud, crude, or disrespectful, but I wanted my money back. After a few minutes, the manager that she had FIRST told about our situation came out to ask what was going on.  He acted as if this was the first he had heard of any issue.  He WAS told several times by 2 different servers.  He didn't care.  He was too busy cutting/boxing orders to care about customer issues.  I don't blame the servers.  Mistakes happen. I'm not upset that my order took as long as it did.  I'm disappointed that the manager on duty placed customer service so low on his priority list that it took over 30 minutes for him to come out of the kitchen to address the issue.    As he was issuing my refund he said, \"I'm really sorry... I sure hope this doesn't happen next time.\"    There will not be a next time.  (written while waiting for my order across the street at Barro's)"}
{"text":"Zella's is no longer Zella's!!! They are now called Mediterranean pita but they will be selling their new lineup of pizza. We tried them tonight and had a horrible experience. We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and we ordered a large sausage pizza with pepperoni on it as well. We also asked for four sides of ranch. The large pizza did not have any pepperoni on it and we did not get any ranch. The kicker to this whole thing is that the medium pepperoni pizza literally and I mean literally had absolutely no cheese on it. The pictures will show a large piece of pizza with cheese and all the other pieces of pizza from the medium have no cheese. My wife called and told them of our dilemma. At first the guy answering the phone says will give you a discount on your next pizza. Um no! He goes back to talk to the old man that was cooking we presume and when he comes back on the phone he says The next time you come back in we will give you a free medium pizza. My wife explained we are feeding a family tonight therefore can you make it this evening and we can come back down and pick it up. We hear a deep sigh in the phone and then he hangs up on us. I'm guessing our number has been blocked since we can no longer reach them when we tried on the same phone. We loved it when it was Zella's but I would run far away from their pizza and because of the poor customer service, just stay away is my best piece of advice for you!!!!"}
{"text":"Awful delivery service. We ordered our pizza over 2 hours ago and when we called to ask about the arrival time  we were told that it was at least 75 min delivery time which was false it was 45 min on YELP. And then the manager Katelyn hung up on my husband. We then called after the pizza arrived missing the brownies and then where told that we were liars, she hung up on us again. The delivery guy brought back our brownies and when asked if he would pay for that pizza he replied no as the pizza was absolutely cold. We will NEVER order here again."}
{"text":"Most Meh pizza and fries ever. So...buffalo chicken fries...ok...sounds interesting. It's not. Greasy. Cold. Lump of coagulated cheese on top. So, pizza should be better, right? Thin crust with sausage and mushrooms....they can't mess that up too bad, right? WRONG! Fresh toppings on a frozen disk of dough (I think it was dough...might have been the cardboard the dough came frozen on, not sure). I went because of all the stellar reviews on Yelp. Either the reviews aren't legit, or Gilbert needs some better places to go. Skip it. You are missing nothing."}
{"text":"I alway order food for delivery and it's good and friendly. I'm from NY and is not as good as really NY pies but it's good."}
{"text":"Great food, especially the pizza... my favorite pizza now.  Great staff quick and courteous, highly recommend this place is your looking for night out with the family.  Descent prices ."}
{"text":"We went to Zellas, always have wonderful service and pizza. The price is the best. I drive all the way from Mesa, Greenfield and University for this pizza!!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were hanging out next door at the bar and they do not serve food. A local patron suggested Zellas next door and we owe him big time! How can you beat a $5 large pizza with plenty of flavor? I couldn't believe anyone could make a pizza for that cheap besides Little Cesar which I still contest is not real cheese or actually edible.   Zellas has found a niche in the market. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the Philly Cheesesteak pizza for $13.99, friendly staff, and that they will walk it over to you at Fox Cigar Bar while you're drinking and watching a baseball game.  I know they sell lots of different items at Zella's, but I love that pizza!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, very friendly. This location seems to run very smoothly and the food was really tasty.. They also deliver which is a huge plus since it's 117 out lol.. I'm glad they opened up this one which is a lot closer for me. I'll definitely be back again & again."}
{"text":"Don't do it.  I put an order in for this morning, the employee who called was nice and we made arrangements for my delivery later due to their fryer being cleaned. No issues here. Things arrived when they said.  That's about where the good review ends. The food that was ordered was the steak fajita salad, the zucchini stix, and their hot wings. The salad was... bizarre? The meat in this seemed to be made out of half egg, and very little discernable about real meat. It was extremely bland.  Still, I could eat most of it even if I'd never order it again. The zucchini stix were unfortunate, bland -- they needed a lot of salt and pepper -- but mostly the issue is they had totally fallen apart. They arrived tattered and soggy.   However, the chicken wings which are usually my favorite part were just gross. Honestly, these were some of the worst chicken wings of my life. I have no idea what seasoning they put on my buffalo wings but it sure wasn't buffalo sauce. Not even the passable ranch they included could cover how incredibly gross these were. On top of it, the fry job on them was poor and they were also a soggy mess.   If you want wings, try Brother's Pizza. I wish I could somehow go back in time and not waste 30$ on this place."}
{"text":"Oakley is a boss..she took initiative and represented the store with professionalism..hard to find these days. Only female employee I noticed and took control amongst the others with little to no effort. The guys definitely seem lost in the sauce here..but not Oakley..promoted asap!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but it took 35 minutes to get our food. And there were only a few tables there all waiting for their food. It appeared they needed more stuff in their kitchen. The man working at the front taking orders was also cooking. Also, our food came out at different times. Pretty bad experience overall! I expressed my concern with a worker and he didn't seem to care and didn't even offer an apology."}
{"text":"Good pizzas and sandwiches. I gave 2 stars because the delivery time is ridiculous. I ordered 2 sandwiches and it's been almost 2 hours. If you plan on trying this place out completely avoid the delivery service!!  Edit: been 3 hours. Called to talk to manager. Not apologetic or anything. Definitely will not be eating from here again."}
{"text":"Ok for $5 - 6  but not good pizza, no  flavor,  good for young children or anyone else who likes bland pizza!  If they want to charge extra for thin crust they should put it in writing! I would rather give my $5.00 to Little Cesar's!"}
{"text":"I like this place. My family recently moved to Gilbert and have been eating out a lot and doing takeout since we're not fully set up at home yet. I've been 2-3 times so far and they've been consistently good/reasonable.   Our first experience wasn't the best though. My wife called in an order and I went to pick it up. 25 minutes later, I arrived and they hadn't processed the order. The girl at the register remembered taking the order, but it didn't go in. I sat in the restaurant with two squirmy kids waiting for my pizza. After about 25 minutes of waiting, I came back to the register. The girl who took the original order from my wife and dealt with me when I arrived looked at me like she had no idea who I was. I reminded her that I'd been sitting/waiting for my pizza. She was clueless. Eventually, she went back and got her manager who found my pizza sitting on the shelf waiting for me. The girl neglected to let me know when it was ready, so no telling how much longer I waited than I needed to.  I get it. Every place has it's moments. I'll be back because the food is good, they're quick (usually) and the price is good."}
{"text":"Good pizza, flavor and price. I can't say the quality was 4 or 5 stars though with all the nearby competitors. Seemed more like a Papa John's style. Doesn't mean it's bad a thing all. It was a good pie and the garlic bread was good too."}
{"text":"Came to eat here this evening, the cashier was very helpful, asked for his recommendation and said the Buffalo Chicken toasted sub was a favorite, so I ordered it with fries and a drink. Pricing wasn't bad about $12 for a toasted sub, fries and a drink.  The toasted sub tasted fantastic, right amount of chicken, ranch and buffalo sauce, fries tasted perfect and the coca-cola, well cant really mess up soda lol. The sandwich was toasted great and the services was on point, ppl are very friendly and the setting was very laid back place to eat with tv's everywhere. Def coming back again!"}
{"text":"No longer deliver during the day. This isn't updated on their site at all. When I called to ask why the girl on the phone was beyond rude and for no reason whatsoever. We order from them multiple times a week for our school. They just lost a lot of business and I'm spreading the word about how horribly they handled themselves. If you don't want people calling and asking you about your change in delivery...then perhaps you need to update it on your site and note the change. Don't cancel my orders without an explanation out of nowhere and expect me not to call asking why. The customer should NEVER be spoken to so rudely when it is the business' fault. Wow."}
{"text":"The chicken pesto sub and zucchini sticks are my favorite the delivery is quick and the staff is very nice"}
{"text":"I was very spetical about this place. As I'm sure everyone knows there are tons of small pizza places that aren't worth the money. However I could spare five bucks so I went in to try the five dollar one toppimg pizza. It was delicious because there's an herb combination put on top of the cheese. I will definitely be coming here if another 5 dollar pizza strikes my mood."}
{"text":"mine is based on their food via delivery on eat24 and grub hub. for w/e reason, this place does not like to pay attention to the special instructions. i've ordered from here multiple times b/c i'm foolish and try to give 2nd chances, but this place has screwed up every time, even in the replica order an hr later!   see, i can't have cheese cuz i'm basically allergic. and i don't like onions. so anything i order, i specifically say 'no cheese, no onions please' yet this place can never get it right. multiple times i complained to eat24 and one time, zellas decided to send a replica order which one did not have cheese, but the other had onions AGAIN!   they just don't care about customers and their food allergies/intolerances... what if i was deathly allergic to the cheese/onions and didn't check before biting into the food?! c'mon zellas, unless you wanna kill your customers, DO BETTER AND READ THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS! i shouldn't have to specifically write 'I WILL DIE IF YOU INCLUDE CHEESE OR ONIONS!' for you to pay attention and do what i ask...."}
{"text":"I order 2 hoagies and 1 order if cheesy bread to be delivered. They said it would be 45-60 min but it took a total of 1 hour and 40 min. The food is great but delivery service is not."}
{"text":"Delicious delivery I had their deep dish pizza at a New Year's eve party and when I found out they delivered they did not disappoint.   We ordered several Philly steak sandwiches as well as a toasted sub. Everything was spectacular. Little bit of moisture in the bread but it's a long drive and the bread was super fresh tasting.  This is our new delivery spot from now on.  No one else has the depth of menu or flavor.  Thank you Zella"}
{"text":"This place sucks bad. I'd rather eat pizza patron. And that pizza sucks ass. Nasty ass skinny pizza. No flavor what's so ever. Rather eat dog food. This place will last not even 1 more year."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty decent if not a little on the plain side. Not much in the way of atmosphere but I would go back. It's great for a quick bit to eat. I will probably go back to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great pizza, I eat here pretty frequently.  Writing this review to give Adrian a shout out.  Awesome customer service.  Thanks for making it happen"}
{"text":"I had previously ordered pizza from this establishment and it took them 2 hours for delivery. They did give me a $20 credit, which was nice. The pizza they delivered was warm and very good. However,I am VERY disappointed with the service that I received this evening. We ordered Pizza, bread sticks, wings, pickles with a Diet Coke. We had a coupon to receive the breadsticks and pizza for only $15. They Charged us FULL Price for those items and When I called to ask her if she got the amount correct, She said all she would do is give us a $4 credit for free breadsticks on our next order.  We ended up just cancelling our order.This is very upsetting because I regularly order and I love the pizza, but they can't seem to get it together. They are disorganized and need new management and staff training."}
{"text":"They got 3 stars because ordering here is hit or miss even when you do it in person. Food is good when they get it right but the last couple of times I have ordered they completely got messed up."}
{"text":"Many great pizza places out there.  Zella's isn't one them.    After trying their gluten free pizza at a neighbors house.  I was impressed.  It was delicious and had me rethinking my previous review.  maybe they've gotten their act together.  Even after my previous review, I thought I would give them another try.  Unfortunately I found the same incompetence as my first order with them.  I ordered on yelp and paid through PayPal.  It was New Year's Eve, and understanding the special circumstances, I waited 2 hours before calling to check in on my order.  I was assured it was out with a driver for delivery.  30 min later and after talking to a couple of managers, I was offered apologies and gift cards, but not wanting to take my chances with them again, I never received a satisfactory resolution or my order.  According to Adrian the \"General Manager,\" the only way to get my $ back to is to take my PayPal statement into their location.  Wasting even more of my time.  This one is my fault.  I should have know better.  -------------------------  Previous review...  Due to severe allergies, the only gluten free pizza my son's friend can eat is Zella's.  Tonight they closed at 6pm for a company party.  I called in at 6pm to place an order.  Although I could hear them taking other orders, they would not take mine.  Even after explaining the allergy situation, they still refused.    I've ordered from there before and the service was good, but the pizza was horrible.  The only reason I tried to order from there this time is the allergy situation and service was not customer friendly."}
{"text":"Really not impressed. Ordered the Famous Philly and the bread was cold plus there was way more bread than meat! For $21 dollars for two people it felt like a waste of money. Only thing that will bring me back is to try their pizza and they have a great soda/tea drink selection."}
{"text":"This is uber cheap pizza joint food. The garlic fries were soggy, under cooked, and tasted of raw garlic. They got pitched. The gyro is a sandwich, literally - not on pita. The gyro meat is this grey, thinly sliced stiff, that looks highly processed. There's not much of it, but that's probably a good thing. The gyro saw two bites, then went  in the bin. Finally, the deep dish pizza is okay, but wouldn't eat it again. I didn't care for the sauce, which was a little watery to me. The crust was decent, albeit a little under cooked on top. There are probably 100 places like this around town, so there's definitely a market for this kind of food. Unfortunately for us, we had to throw away $40 to figure that out."}
{"text":"I was munching on a slice of pizza and felt something hard when I was chewing. I immediately spit it out and realized there was a piece of PLASTIC baked into the pizza. My jaw still hurts. I called and spoke to the store/ General Managaer, which accomplished nothing. She showed ZERO sincerity and concern. She almost sounded annoyed that we called. I'm not looking for a free $5 pizza, but I am looking for a more genuine approach to the situation.   I understand it's $5 pizza and I understand accidents happen, but cmon. Pay attention to what you're feeding your customers."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood place for pizza, subs and burgers. We met the owner when we went there for lunch today, mid afternoon on a Sunday, so not super busy. My husband is gluten free (GF) and kept resisting every time I suggested we try it out. Well, today, he's very glad I persisted :).  The restaurant itself is kind of small, but very clean with nice seating and tables. Good drink options at the soda fountain with multiple flavors.  In chatting with the owner they've got several GF options.  Dh got a gf chicken cheesesteak hoagie on a big GF sub roll. It's been years since he was able to enjoy a real steak sandwich. Yummy! The owner recommended trying the toasted subs next time, and we will.  He also graciously comped us a GF pizza. Their GF is 14\", bigger than most other gf pizzas, and delicious!! Thin crust, crispy and able to hold up to the yummy sauce and toppings. One of the best GF pizzas we've ever had, and we've tried almost all of them!  I got the philly cheese steak wit whiz, on an authentic Amoroso's roll. We're from Philly and have had lots of cheese steaks over the years. The roll makes a big difference. This was yummy! Highly recommend. Our daughter got the cheeseburger. Big double patty burger-juicy and fresh, and some tasty steak fries too. She's picky and gave it 2 thumbs up.  We all really enjoyed our meals and look forward to our next visit. If you're looking for a great place in the Gilbert area give Zellas a try."}
{"text":"Roman the General Manager helped us with an order mess up. He very professionally dealt with the mix up and took care of our order. From now on when we order from Zellas again it will be because of Romans professionalism. Love the toasted gyro sandwich! And $5 large pizza can't be beat."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza, decent wings (coming from someone who grew up near Buffalo).  yummy fried food and sandwiches are good too.  You just can't go wrong here.  Delivery is quick and reliable.  Frustrated that online ordering has been messed up for a couple weeks.  Go through the process only to find it isn't working."}
{"text":"This place sucks! $48 bucks for soggy sweet potato fries and philly sandwich. Received the wrong order for my wings too. I have never felt more scammed in my life! Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"They literally only have a star because I had to give one. I ordered from them at 6:08 pm and just received my food at 7:47 pm. When I called around 7:20 pm I was told I was waiting because no one that was at the store new how to make a Pizza Philly Cheesesteak. Are freaking kidding me so no one there knows how to do their job and me as a customer suffers because lack of good leadership at this store. When I opened my bags I find out that my pizza Philly cheesesteak wasn't that at all but a regular cheesesteak. Immediately called the store upset talked to a manager"}
{"text":"Everything is fantastic! The service is fast the food is fresh and tasty! Bread on the baked subs is phenomenal! Jeff's the man and makes sure everything goes out perfect and everyone is satisfied! Definitely recommend to all my friends and family! Perfect for delivery on that Sunday afternoon wings and pizza with some football! This is my new go-to!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get . Ordered 2 slices and a ranch side and it was 7.30$ . Also I know for sure I have been to another location and had a slice and boneless wings with drink combo and it was reasonable but they told me they don't have that here and never have ... After I ordered , they came out after a few min and told me that they had to remake the pizzas cause they ran out and it would be 15 more minutes ... Needless to say , if you are close to Venezia's , I would go there and get a real slice .  Sorry but I'm just being honest .  As for the pizza itself is decent ( tends to have a bit of cornmeal but decent flavor ) I'm just hungry   Side note , I heard 2 customers indicate the soda machine tasted like chemical ..."}
{"text":"So pizza Fanatic meets health conscious, I ordered the gluten free pizza crust with veggies . Asked them to double bake the crust for a firmer crust and its AMAZING!!! Honestly the pizza gods were dancing in my mouth , great flavor and ingredients."}
{"text":"Best gluten free bread around! I've been eating gluten free for health reasons for 4 years now and I'm always looking for better bread substitutes because i love sandwiches!  When I found out they had a gluten free sub roll I was so ecstatic! And when I tasted it, I was even more impressed. I eat here several times a week and it's always delicious!  I do suggest the gluten free bread a little toasted over not toasted as the texture is a bit better but still good either way.  I was hooked on the sandwiches, have tried almost every one on the menu... And then I tried the gluten free pizza. Best one in town!!! I've now had at least 15 different gluten free pizzas in the valley- I'm always on the hunt, and this one takes the cake! Highly recommend for gluten free peeps!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a philly, and happened to be just a couple of miles from Zella's. The young lady at the cash register did it all, took your money, cleared tables, brought the food to the tables, cleaned up the tables and surrounding areas, and not only was she efficient and friendly, but also a big fan of her restaurant and talked about it glowingly!  She said they baked all their bread in house and it was wonderful.  A woman at a neighboring table said \"I'm a first timer too and the food is great\"!  Everyone has their own idea of what makes a philly good and personal taste has a lot to do with our expectations. We both ordered the Steak Cheese & Mushroom toasted sub.  What we got was a salad sub with a bit of meat.  The roll was warm and crusty and delicious.  Inside there was abundant shredded lettuce, onion, green pepper, sliced tomato, and a tasty dressing, and some cheese, thinly sliced steak and some sliced mushrooms.  We were accustomed to a lot more meat and cheese, but they tasted good.  They had 2 multiple drink machines, one with sodas and one with tea.  The pizzas I noticed others eating looked really good.  Based on the \"philly\" alone we had, I would rate them 3 stars at best.  I will return to try their pizza."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review.  While I was not happy with the Gyro at Zella's, I went back to try more of their food.  Never judge a book by it's cover.  First - the staff and owners have bent over backwards to make my bad experience perfect.  I've since tried other subs (Turkey, Chicken) and many of their pizzas.  They have a 24\" pizza, and numerous $5 one topping pizzas.  They also have a deep dish.  Literally, I have to eat my words.  These are all excellent.  Especially for the price.  What's more important is, if they are not OK, they will do everything to make it right.  Folks... this is not a \"Pappa Johns, or Domino's.  This is a family business trying to succeed.  Try it.  I guarantee you will like what you taste.  If not... don't worry!  Again.. I take back my previous review.  While I still would not order the Gyro sub, there are many other things on the menu that you can get instead!  All of them are great."}
{"text":"I am very impressed.  I had tried this location when it was Genos and was not impressed.  I didn't even bother when it was Buddy's, instead I went down to Power Road and got Zella's.  For 5 bucks, you can't beat it and me driving further than normal said a ton about the quality at the Power Rd location.  I discovered this location on Williams Field and am happy they are closer to home.  I got a pizza and a garden salad.  Both were fantastic for the price ($10 for both).  The salad really, really impressed me because it was super fresh.  I took a picture (I put the salad in my own bowl).  Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worse customer service throughout that whole day. I'm here in pnx for a week For work no car I look up delivery service and find your business. I call @3pm and try to place an order and I am told there will be no driver till 6:30pm. I patiently wait because I really want to try your deep dish pizza looks amazing. I call at 6:20 to assure I can get an order in since I have now waited 3 hours to order. A snickering female says their driver won't come in til after 630 and that it's not even for sure when he will come in. And to call back later!!! I asked her if she was serious am I supposed to cross my fingers and wait another 40 minutes to order food from their business and she laughs and says yes I guess. LEFT EITH THE CRAVING AND JUST WENT TO BED HORRIBLE SERVICE FROM 3pm and worse service at 630 from female!"}
{"text":"$6 pizza (pepperoni) special was ok but nothing memorable.  Sparse.  Garlic crust didn't have any zing.  Friend ordered cheesesteak w/fries and more flavorful than the pizza was!  I'd skip the pizza next time.  Service was good and friendly even though it was a late Saturday afternoon.   I do have to say there were a LOT of $6 pizza orders going out the door as part of take-out!  Several multiple order pizzas and one was 10 pizzas.  Service folks on these multiple orders were taking them out to the cars without complaint and that is a good indicator of the people within."}
{"text":"We were looking for pizza delivery and I love having tons of toppings on my pizza. We were going to order from somewhere else but it was so expensive just for one pizza with tons of toppings. We ended up ordering the workz, a cheese pizza, zucchini stix, and wings for the same amount as one pizza at the other place. Everything was good! The pizza had everything I wanted on it and tasted great and hot! Definitely will order from them again when I don't want to go out."}
{"text":"I gave it a 3. The pizza taste good but it was not very warm.  Chicken wing was soggy. Eating them tomorrow by putting them in the oven."}
{"text":"You can ask any and they will tell you that I am not a Pizza fan at all. I mean I like a slice from time to time, but not my first choice.  I have bought pizza from here and I have bought dough balls to make my own pizza at home and it was also very good.   The people working there made sure we knew what we were buying when I asked for a dough ball to make pizza. They're fast and very nice."}
{"text":"I received a flyer in the mail and decided to give it a try. I was very impressed with the customer service as soon as I walked in, especially with only one guy working. He took the order, made my food, and had a nice conversation with me at the end. It was great food for a great price! I received a business card from the manager, Adrian, and I am excited to go back and try more food!"}
{"text":"Took more than 2 hours for delivery and the manager on duty didn't care or try to make anything right.  I will never order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great family spot or place for cheap but good pizza. We love to go get a few $5 pizzas, which are WAYYYY better than Little Caesars. Salads are ok. We got 5 pizzas for our daughters bday party and they were quickly eaten!"}
{"text":"We have wanted to try this quaint spot and am so glad we did today! The food was great awesome staff and the manager was attentive. Fun individual pizza slicer with the foot long slice. Philly was delicious with the Z sauce as recommended.  A must try."}
{"text":"I am already a huge Zella's fan so when I happened upon a major pizza craving this evening, I was excited to order in from the new location! Tanya, who took my order, was super friendly, patient, & helpful with my indecisive tastebuds! The gentleman who delivered our order, I didn't catch his name, was also very friendly and offered to carry the pizza's in for me as I was managing my toddler. As for the pizza, salad, and breadsticks... Awesome, as always. The fresh toppings and flavored crusts make it over the top! And the Zella's sauce.... Delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. Reminds me of Geno's Giant Slice. Maybe a bit better though. Boxes even look the same. They have a $5 large one topping with a flavored crust. All in all, way better then little Cesar's for a $5 pizza."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Philly melt. Everyone was nice. Not a large place so not much to say. Will definitely try again for some variety. Can't beat the price"}
{"text":"Great pizza, so 2 stars. However, they have noted on the menu that bottled beer is $2.75, and imports are 3.65. This is funny. When I asked why they are charging an import price for a domestic beer, Blue Moon, the owner said he doesn't have enough keys on his register to discern a 3rd class of beers. when that didn't fly, he said that the distributer charges the same price for it as he does for imports. Ok. Ugh!!"}
{"text":"Ordered on my phone! Great food and very reasonable prices and it's conveniently close to home. Hope this neighborhood spot stays."}
{"text":"For the price, this is a really good pizza. Actually, despite the price, this is a good pizza. If you pick it up, it's $6 for a pizza and it tastes better than most other pizza joints that charge more for their pies.   We've been eating here since it opened and they're pretty consistent on quality and taste. They have some issues with consistency on their specialty pizzas, and sometimes the customer service is subpar, but otherwise it's a good value."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!  I had ordered some burgers for delivery and when they arrived, they were missing most of the sides on them. Spoke with Katelyn the manager and the prep guy did tell her he forgot them. She offered a $17 credit for next time. So, next time was tonight. Not only did they forget the bacon, but Katelyn charged us $11 on a $21 bill. WHAT? We should have only paid $4 and change with the $17 credit.  I called Katelyn and not only did she have an attitude with me saying, \"it's obvious we can't do anything to make you happy.\"  Well no, my orders both times were messed up, missing toppings. Also, talking with an extremely rude manager. Katelyn was getting mad at me for her mistakes and said she'll just refund me and call it done, Then she HUNG UP on me. You really need to retrain your staff, especially.the managers. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and not too bad on the prices. The only real issue I have is the $5 delivery charge. I assumed at the time thy since it was so much, it was for the driver. Turns out the driver only gets 2 of those dollars. The rest is to cover restaurant insurance. So, if your food arrives in a timely manner and with a smile, be sure to throw in a couple of extra bucks."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food was subpar as was the service. It didn't appear anyone had a real position in the store or knew what everyone was up to. We waited an extra 15 minutes for the food. I will say the Greek fries were good but the pizza was average. Well try it again in a month and see"}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks awesome!!! Service friendly and nice. Food was out quickly as requested. Pizza-- not sure?? Prize is right. We got the thin crust but it was not light. Maybe reduce the weight of the thin crust dough for the large and let it rise a little longer? Luv'd the brownie and always luv the Coke machines that you can design your own drink. Will go back for the sandwiches and soda machine"}
{"text":"Looked at reviews thought I would give Zella's a try. What a joke. Whoever said best fries they ever had should go to a bowling alley where they serve better fries. I ordered a original Philly cheesesteak it was about the width of three fingers just above the bland tasting. I would not recommend going to this establishment $9 for original Philly cheesesteak fries is not worth it. Maybe the pizza better but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food is awesome for the price! Very fresh salad, warm breadsticks and the Greek fries were fantastic! Easy to order, Fast delivery, and a very friendly delivery guy, definitely recommend if you're in the mood for some awesome food."}
{"text":"Slooooooowww delivery. Tonight. Noooo delivery. I paid $23.00 .. called restaurant; manager was NO HELP. He said, \" I am trying to find your order \" like 5 times. I was in the middle of a movie. Did not want to spend my Friday night listening to him REPEAT over and over again,\" I cannot find your order.\" Asked for a REFUND but no one has said anything about my $23.00!   No food. No Service. No refund."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time. We ordered the pizza and boneless wing special. Pepperoni pizza with garlic crust and 10 boneless hot and 10 boneless hot BBQ. The pizza was very good- the garlic crust was tasty. They also sprinkle oregano on the pizza- it was ok but I think they should ask if the customer wants it on there. Overall I liked the pizza- great value and quality. Now the boneless wings were more like popcorn chicken- kind is small round nuggets. The hot BBQ was better than the plain hot, but still small for the price. They also only give 2 very small containers of ranch- the ranch was good, just not enough.  I have not tried any other food item yet, but I will."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from the location on Valvista and I am truly not impressed. We usually go to the power location, the service is good, food is great. They should learn from this location. It is a lot farther from my home than the valvista location, however they definitely get my delivery much faster.  We ordered at 9:47 it is now 11:57 and no food ):"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time after getting my nails done right around the corner, this place is awesome, I love the pizza, the crust, the wings and the special sauce but most of all the customer service!! I am taking my whole family out with me next week to this place just because they are really amazing"}
{"text":"Picked my food up and half was missing again and what we did get was cold. Super terrible customer service as well"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza! I ordered from Eat24 App and received fresh pizza on time very easily. I got an X large Pizza w/ 4 toppings for $20 and tasted just right. First time I ordered pizza in Az that was affordable and up to my standards. I look forward to ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"Got a coupon in the mail about a new location and pickup pizza for $5. How could I resist. Ordered a pepperoni pizza with FREE flavored crust, I chose garlic, and it was amazing. Busy but great service. If you are thinking about getting Little Caesars $5 pizza, please for the love of everything that is delicious think again. Get Zella's! Super fast and delicious. Can't wait to go back. Living in Gilbert and now have my new go to quick pizza place. You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"Best $5 pizza out there.  You can even get flavored crust with it.  My son always want me to go there and get him a pizza.   Good job guys."}
{"text":"pizza was little Caesars quality turkey and Italian was edible at minimum will not order again I can get Brooklyn vs in Gilbert for 10$ more and uses handmade ingredients"}
{"text":"More than the pizza is excellent at Zellas. The burgers are definitely worth trying. I highly recommend you try this place. The customer service is always good."}
{"text":"Ordered the works pizza and it's was bomb!  Delivery was on time. Ordered chicken wings hot, we're very good could have been Spicer but all in all everything was delicious!  Definitely will order again."}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice. The first time it was awesome. Great pizza great customer service. Second time not so much, we called and the girl asked if it was for pick up or delivery, when I said delivery she hesitated and said they weren't delivering anymore, this was two hours prior to closing."}
{"text":"Zellas is amazing! Super yummy inexpensive pizza & decent wings. They get you with their coupons."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of zellas at a few different locations,  I just had the pizza and some baked fries, buffalo to be exact, definitely  my favorite one out of the ones they offer. Place was very clean and the customer service was on point. Thank you zellas for always making my experience great."}
{"text":"Over two hours for delivery, no contact from the store, I was given three different stories on why it was taking so long. I was also told that the driver was on his way, called back 30 minutes later and was told the same thing. I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick lunch. I got a slice that was very tasty and fresh. As an added bonus they even had anchovies.  I also got a side Salad that was large and fresh. The pricing was reasonable and the people working here were very friendly. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great and affordable pizza. Nut allergy friendly. Busy and small location but take the time to get the order right and fast. Recommend for a family meal."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, 5 stars. The service is exceptional from all. Every person is there to help. 5 stars for customer service as well. Thank you Zella's crew. We are happy ever time. THANK YOU FOR THE YUMMY Z SAUCE."}
{"text":"Great food I had the cheese steak and it was fantastic.  We also had meatball sub great choice.  Good service I would recommend.  Did I also mention 5 dollar large pizza with flavor crust....."}
{"text":"We stopped at Zella's for lunch at 1:45 today.  It was not prime lunch time, so we did not have any wait at all.  My husband got chicken cheesesteak and I got the beef cheesesteak.  It was so delicious, hot with perfectly cut meats. And that roll it is served on is the best !  We felt like we were celebrities as the assistant manager had the time to come out and be sure our food was delicious and offered us to try their sauce and asked if we needed anything.   He had a moment to talk with us and he is such a pleasant young man.   If everyone offered customer service like he does, how nice the world would be.   So 5 stars is very fair for this food and service.  Thank you, Adrian Acosta, for making our day brighter!!!!   Ray & I enjoyed our visit and will certainly return."}
{"text":"My son and I went to Zella's for the first time Mon. and loved it. Our cashier was super friendly and helpful with what they're known for. We each got a baked sandwich and split them so we could each try two. Got the steak and mushroom as well as the Italian. Omgawd were they yummy!"}
{"text":"Good prices. Good Pizza. Zellas has become my new go-to for pizza delivery. Nothing against my normal delivery service, but zellas is a little better flavor and definitely better priced."}
{"text":"This is is by far the best pizza I have had in awhile. The five dollar is large is worth way more. The quality of the product is amazing! The home made taste is great! The place is very clean and the customer service is amazing as well. Jeff was very friendly and patient with my son as he watched them make the pizza. This place is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"Since the first day I tried Zella's I loved it. Their cheesesteaks shine and are probably the best I've had in Arizona to date. The only reason I'm not rating this 5 stars is due to the sometimes inattentive cashier and staff. I have ordered a pepper philly 3 times without jalapenos and subbed in provolone. First time was perfect, everything I asked for. The second time I received a pepper philly no jalapenos American cheese. Third time a provolone philly with green peppers but without most of the peppers that come on a pepper philly. This time they forgot we had ordered steak and mushroom fries and we had to inquire about them then the kitchen order was placed. Great cheesesteaks but how difficult is it to follow the customer's order when the basic item is on the menu? Always get your receipt- it shouldn't be an option it's for your protection."}
{"text":"Just picked up Philly Cheese and fries.  I realize all Philly's in Phoenix are wannabes so I never expect a true sandwich.  Bread was good but sandwich was light on beef and cheese.  More beef and more cheese and this could have been a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Pretty good, need to work on speed. Way better than it was when it was Geno's. But it works if you wanta good toasted sandwich or a cheep pizza"}
{"text":"The service seemed rather distracted with other things we waited a bit but was definitely worth the wait food was delicious all of the food was so good!!!"}
{"text":"Zella's is awesome!  Delicious Philly Subs... Cheesesteak, Mushroom and BBQ are my favorites.  Great Pizza and Fries!  Quick delivery and very friendly Staff!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with our pizza, it was fresh and had just enough spices, pepperoni, cheese & sauce! Very good for the money!"}
{"text":"Awesomest pizza joint since Nick's 24/7 Pizza.  In fact, that's the only way this place could get any better -- if they were always open.  Extremely yummy pizza, with options like sesame seed crust, for a killer price."}
{"text":"I got the chicken pesto sandwich.  This is a really well prepared meal with exceptional flavor.  My family also ordered a pizza.  Great portion sizes.  The pizza was huge.  Will order from here again."}
{"text":"Great place! Reasonably priced, cheesesteaks are fantastic, fries are the best I've ever had. Can't wait to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered a turkey sandwich and waited over 30 minutes at 8pm when it was not busy at all. One of the female employee was very nice but it still took a very long time and the sandwich was mediocre."}
{"text":"Gonna keep it brief...   This place is affiliated with Geno's - both are small-ish local chains, and both share similar menus and recipes. If you ate here when it was a Geno's and liked it, you won't be disappointed. Had a cheesesteak today here. It was pretty great - as I expected it to be. If you get one - order extra meat, and use their Z sauce.   I'll write more next time I order a pizza or something, but in general - I'm a big fan of Zella's and Geno's. This location is super clean, food is good, and staff is nice. Not much to complain about. I think the plan is probably to expand and build more of these - wouldn't mind having one by my house."}
{"text":"We were a little skeptical because of the reviews on google, but our meal was absolutely delicious. From the Honey BBQ wings, Bacon,ranch and chicken fries and gluten free Hawaiian pizza. This little hole-in-the-wall pizzeria completely exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back and we are glad we decided to try something new."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever!  They told me my food be delivered in 45-50 mins.  I called them after an hour and the driver had never left!!!! I was told that the driver had confusion on my address.  They had my number if they had any issues.  The person gave the driver the phone.  I spoke to manager who gave me a percentage off.  Still not worth it because my kids are hungry! Doesn't matter if food is good but will not order if I can't get my food in the allotted time.  Lucky I had to give 1 star.  If in the area of Gilbert and Queen creek don't order. Also receiving food I found hair in my cheesesteak!  This is no bueno!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered them delivery a couple of times with no problems. Great food, fast delivery and good customer service. Definitely try the cheese bread it's amazing! Excited to try the flavored crust next!"}
{"text":"We are so happy that Zella's opened up in the neighborhood. We have ordered from them on multiple occasions and have gone into the restaurant and every time they have been friendly and fast. The food is delicious... if you haven't ordered the large pizza, prep yourself for what appears to be 24 inches of pure goodness.   We can't recommend them enough."}
{"text":"Review of Delivery: The food was good, but do not order online through Yelp - our order was lost and it took 2 hours to get our food.  After waiting an hour for delivery I called and they said the order was missed.  :(  The manager gave us a 20% discount, but it still took 45 minutes for the food to be delivered."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery on a Friday night and it took 1.5 hours to arrive. Okay; understandable...But the pizza was not any good. Very little cheese and cold. The girls wouldn't eat it. I ordered a sandwich without cheese and there was so much cheese I couldn't pick it off! The entire order ended up in the trash :("}
{"text":"OWNER PLEASE READ  Recommendation!  Your flavored crust options are so delicious You should offer Zella's Crust Sticks! Served with marinara! Please, please!!    I'm so happy they opened a Zella's right on my corner! No more driving to Power! What more can I say! $5.00 for a large one topping pizzas! Free flavored crust too!?!?! Nothing can beat that! I've never had a bad tasting pizza from Zella's. The ranch crust is addicting! I also order the boneless wings with honey hot sauce and the sauce is amazing. Every time I order for pick up its ready in 15 minutes or less. The ladies at the counter are always friendly. I recommend giving this place a try. Rosatis overpriced garbage has nothing on Zella's!"}
{"text":"After spending a good 20 mins on Yelp we found this place Zella's. It had pizza, wings, and most importantly, cheese steak sandwiches. We showed up after a school concert around 8:15pm. The server was new, but friendly welcoming as we worked our way through the menu to figure out what to eat. We ended up ordering a small pizza (half pep and cheese) along with 2 Steak Hoagie sandwiches and some garlic fries. When I saw the bill say $45 I was like... HUH... that seems like a lot but that also included 4 drinks. At this point we were ready to eat so $$ didn't matter. Then as everyone sits down and I get ready to pay, a coworker walks up to the cashier and says that the cook for the grill just left and they can't make any sandwiches...   I was pretty much floored as I looked around as saw at least 4-5 others working in the back but no cook. That's when I got the news \"no steak sandwiches\"... I stood with a blank look and pretty much told her not to ring my card.... That was why we came. I didn't fuss... I just looked at  my watch, paused and said, your open for at least another 90mins... So I took my business across the plaza.   I gave 2 stars because it wasn't the cashier/server's fault. She was just delivering bad news. She was helpful in getting our order and inquiring about things. Disappointed that we didn't get to try any of the food, but it was definitely a turn off for our 1st experience. They have another location but we are not on that side of town so hopefully the next time will be an experience where I can talk about the food!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful pizza joint. I have never had such great pizza for the price. The pizza is delicious and the flavors garlic, butter and cheese on the crust was amazing. We had salami as our one topping and it was their special for five bucks--a whole pizza, slices cost that much other places. The owner created this great oil and spice blend that goes well on everything. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Food is just Okay and they take a long time to prepare food here! There's like Six people in the Back and What are you doing? Never coming to this place again"}
{"text":"Great prices and Great Food!! I love this place and it has become the \"Go-to\" spot for a quick dinner fix. We love their pizza and wing specials too.. they change often enough to keep us coming back and are never over-priced."}
{"text":"New staff, the only ones in the store and they forgot our order and continued to do phone order pizzas. After 25 min I gave up and asked. They gave me a refund but the situation was just awkward. No one knew what to do or how to handle it. They did not start my food until I asked what happened. As far as the food They was more cheese on the wrapper than on my cheese steak. The place has changed names 3 times so I'm obviously not the only one confused."}
{"text":"Josh was awesome!  He was super friendly and helpful.  Zella's is my kids favorite pizza."}
{"text":"I came in last week and and it was just excellent customer service by Cami. Lovely person and great smile and suggested the cinnastix which were amazing and I highly recommend too all!! Good job Cami and keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time. I had been craving a real Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. The Famous Philly was deliciously cheesy (gotta love Cheese Wiz). I also got the Zucchini Sticks. They were really good. I will definitely come here again. I want to try the pizza next time.  The staff was also very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome owners!!!  I have always been treated phenomenally whenever we have ordered food from here."}
{"text":"The cheesesteak was flaccid and somewhat tasteless. The meat was average and the roll used as a bun was lacking. The cheesesteak fries were bomb though and I would go back for those and in my experience their pizza is nothing special but it's decent in respect to pizza so it's a slightly above average meal; just don't order the cheesesteak!!!"}
{"text":"finally made my way to the restaurant. My first thought was, New York ? I love the little spot. of course I love the food tried the deep dish pizza and it was to die for!!!!!!!! I love pizza and this has been my favorite so far. the pizza just melted with bite. the staff was very welcoming all but the one young lady with the red shirt she was not friendly at all. as the staff was bringing out our order they let us know what they were bringing out as it was 6 of us. she just dropped it off on the table and left. so we had to look inside the sandwich to figure out whose it was. not good therefor 4 stars."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with the staff , friendly and helpful ! Good was good and place was very clean ! I will defiantly  go again"}
{"text":"Tried a thin crust pepperoni with the \"free\" sesame seed option. The price is suspiciously low ($7 for a 14\" pie, plus $1.50 per topping), and now I know why. The crust was on par with a typical frozen supermarket pizza, the pepperoni didn't have much flavor, likewise for the cheese, which was kinda greasy. The sauce was just.. forgettable. Overall, I would have given it a \"C\" as a packaged frozen pizza. As a fresh pizzeria pizza, it should have done much better, even at the dirtball price. Verdict: 1 star for the pizza, plus charity star thrown in for cheerful staff.  Lots of people seem to like the place (I checked the other Gilbert location's reviews) so I gotta believe they're getting the standard crust and it's gotta be a better option."}
{"text":"This place is okay - better than fast food pizza joints.  The take out and delivery business must be good because we were the only ones eating in the restaurant.  When the pizza and sandwich was served we had to ask for a plate and utensils (paper and plastic).  Not sure why or how these ratings are as high as they were but Yelp is the reason we stopped in for dinner.  Again, not on the same level of Gilbert Pizza or Grimaldi's but scores on Yelp indicated otherwise.  Just set your expectations and enjoy your take out or delivery...why would anyone give this place 4 or 5 stars?"}
{"text":"I am a regular costumer here and this is the second time in a month that I call my order and it's not ready when I arrive. Both times they have said they are running behind. Granted I don't get here sooner than the 45 minutes they say it's going to take ! My family loves this pizza but this is the last time I am going to order from this location"}
{"text":"Good priced Pizza and tastes good. The Wings were nothing special but will definitely keep coming back to order Pizza."}
{"text":"I am so impressed with the customer service I just received from this restaurant, specifically from a yong man named Chandler. All the people working tonight were very professional and helpful, but I felt the most personal service in one short minute when Chandler brought out my pizza, wished me a safe night with sincerity and offered to open the door as I left with my arms full. He is definitely an asset to this business."}
{"text":"This place used to be a 5 but recently things have changed, pizza size is smaller and taste like cardboard. Prices seem to be increasing.  We live just around  the corner and this was our happy hour rescue food..... the only thing I'll order is the oven baked subs subs but even those seem to have changed in taste, not as ooey, gooey.... still tastey, just not as great as before. Seems like once these places get business, the quality decreases and prices increase, unfortunate because this was a family favorite until recently."}
{"text":"Quick, easy lunch or dinner. Good food to have on your lunch break but much too greasy for me and everything I've tried is just covered in grease! Fantastic prices and fast service."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The pizza is amazing, the prices are great, and service is friendly. pesto sauce is A+, online ordering is efficient....I've been both in the restaurant and Had delivery, both were great quality.  If you're looking for good pizza in Gilbert that is flavorful and well cooked - then go to Zella's!"}
{"text":"After ordering for delivery and eating the food I am surprised at how great the reviews were. We ordered the buffalo fries, the boneless honey Bbw wings, and a Hawaiian pizza. Maybe it's bc the fries would be better if immediately consumed but the cheese had stopped being melty and I'm sure  that they wanted to create us a great meal it just wasn't delicious that is all."}
{"text":"Love the gyro. Home made taziki and garlic sauce. Cant beat it!!!!  The sub sauce they have is really good too.  Bomb deep dish!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is by far my favorite food and being from Chicago, it can be hard to find anything that compares to what I've had back home. At first I was hesitant to try a place that offers $5 pizzas but I'm SO glad I did. The customer service is great but their pizza truly is delicious. I pick it over all the pizza places near our house every time! I've heard their hot subs are amazing too but have yet to try them. Something to look forward to! If you're looking for really good pizza (and desserts!) you have to try Zella's!!"}
