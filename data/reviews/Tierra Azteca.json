{"text":"Looking at the reviews I was doubting it to try a new place but I was kind of wrong thinking it might not be good but the food was excellent! It was fresh and so taste.  I definitely will come back. Server was polite and friendly. The price is fair. Two people $40.00."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Swung-by this morning just before noon. I'm portuguese/italian . . . my spanish is gnarly at the best of the times, so I've must've given the waitress-cook a massive headache, hahaha. After lil bit of time of funky, freaky and ultimately funny attempts at us trying to understand each other, I ordered 3 quesadilla's and 1 tamalles.   Yum, yum, yum . . . Especially loved the quesadilla with cheez and jalapeno's. It was a special request. Nothing more yummy than a charred tortilla with oooey-gooey cheez and firey hot peppers.   Super cool peeps front and behind the counter. Dude (referred him as . . . 'mi hermano') I was vibing with while waiting is co-owner orginally from argentina.   All-the-way around . . . awesome"}
{"text":"Such an unassuming place with yummy food!  Literally, it's at the back of a Latin American bakery-money transfering-convenience store, so no points for \"decor\" or \"atmosphere\". Grab a drink from the convenience store fridge before you sit down.   We got there on Saturday and the menu items were: Menudo (meat/tripe soup), carnita (shredded pork shoulder) or shredded lamb served with corn tortillas, and a trio of onions, cilantro and limes. They assumed we spoke Spanish which was cute. The carnita and lamb tacos were delicious! The lamb was mildly gamey like goat which I prefer over boring old beef. The pork was savory and had nice crispy bits, proper. The tortillas were steamy, pliable, didn't fall apart and served in a warm towel. We made our tacos and kept eating and eating. We ordered extra tortillas and I think I ended up eating 8 tacos! So full! Ok, I like my tacos gentrified (you know pork belly, fish etc with fancy sauces etc) but these tacos were legit.  Simple, but still full of flavour and authentic (we were the only non-Spanish speaking people there).  Ok, paying which is done at the convenience store cash register.  It's $12/per meat order which the very nice server explained was 250g (a bit over a cup of meat). We didn't get charged for the additional tortillas.  So $30 for 2 meat orders, a $2 drink and tax/tip. I thought for some reason (the location/decor) that it would be slightly cheaper but $15/person is reasonable.  Was it worth it? Yes. Will I be back? Probably, when I am hankering for no-frills tacos!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! The tacos al pastor were de-lish. And the horchata too. And it's run by the nicest people this side of Yonge. A must-eat if yr looking for authentic Mexican eats!"}
{"text":"I wasn't pleased with the service and the food was bellow decent"}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible and the service is the worst. So rude, and really not capable of running as a restaurant. They screwed up my order 3 times. Don't bother with the place."}
{"text":"Wow, what a joke. Used to be amazing but is now absolutely terrible. We paid $13 for \"1/4 kg of pork\" which was more like 1/16 kg. It was also terrible quality. The pozole was also terrible. Badly made and tasted awful. Service took forever. My wife is from Mexico and we travel there several times a year. We know what mexican food is supposed to be like, and this is just terrible food. We will never be going back. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Sort of a Mexican diner, Tierra Azteca cranks out some seriously yummy food from their kitchen in spite of the lacklustre space up on Bloor Street right at Dufferin. Looking in, you will be guessing if it even is a restaurant. But once seated and greeted by the genuinely warm staff with their iPads ready to take your order, you will get a feeling that you're part of their family.  I've had the beef and chorizo tacos which are tasty, but the soup was the best. It was a lamb consommé, with a richness of broth that only comes from a home style kitchen. Along with a couple chunks of meat and bone under that delicious slick of reddish brown fat floating deliriously on top, this will make you feel warm all over. Looking forward to trying some of the shared dishes that other were enjoying here."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Part grocery store, part taco stand.  You order meat (pork or lamb) by the kilo or half-kilo, which is served with a stack of fresh tortillas, diced red onions, cilantro, limes and hot sauce.  Presto!  You got yourself some tacos!  Throw in some real Mexican coke (made with real sugar!), and you've got yourself one heck of a hangover cure.  They also serve pozole, but I've yet to try it.  Also, the only place I've found that sells canned cuitlacoche (a delicious corn fungus - for real!)."}
{"text":"I have attempted to eat here on a couple Saturday afternoons but just ended up leaving with groceries as it was always super busy. Finally today the timing worked out and a table was available. We got two orders of carnita and a gigantic bowl of Menudo to split. The meal came with a stack of excellent tortillas, onions, cilantro, limes, and two sauces (hot and scary hot). Our server was very nice and we ended up leaving with lots of leftovers. Including two drinks our meal came out to just under $20 per person. Each serving of pork is around $13 so I would recommend ordering one per couple to split as it's plenty of food. Also if you speak Spanish it will come in very handy here ;)!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing! Most delicious and authentic Mexican in Toronto. Came in here after passing by a number of times and remaking on the interesting layout of the store and hole-in-the-wall vibe. The place was packed as Mexico was playing Italy in Soccer.   We got the Pork Carnitas and the Lamb as well. Was a bit difficult to order as none of the Waitresses spoke English but the owner was very friendly and assured us it would be delicious.  The Pork and Lamb came out with fresh tortillas, Green Salsa, Red Spicy Salsa, Cilantro and Onions. Everything had lots of bite and tons of flavour. It was great and quite resonable at $12 a plate."}
{"text":"Meets most of my Mexican food needs. If you want or expect Tex-Mex go somewhere else. If you have lived in or are from Mexico. This is the place you have been looking for! Enough said!"}
{"text":"I just love this place.  They satisfy all of the needs one has for hard-to-find Mexican groceries. They have a selection of queso fresco in their front fridge, incredible chorizo, and an overwhelmingly good assortment of imported Mexican treats, beverages and sauces (the hot sauce with chapulines looks incredible!)  In case this isn't enough, walk past the grocery area into their small dining area, where you will be given a menu to order some of the tastiest, most authentically prepared and inexpensive Mexican food in the city! Yum!"}
{"text":"You walk in thinking it's a grocery store, but there is a restaurant at the back serving delicious, authentic home-style Mexican food. I had the lamb carnitas with warm tortillas and fresh toppings. The lamb was perfectly cooked, with so much flavour. The tomatilla salsa was a great pairing! You have to go early in the day, or they will run out of certain things."}
{"text":"Note to self: from now on always order the owners recommendations.  Tried the lamb tacos. Fantastic! Reminds server about the salsa... He forgets  They even have genuine pop . Tried three tamarind soda. Remember you shake the bottle before sipping. This place is authentic Mexican. Trump would wall them in. I'd scale that wall over and over."}
{"text":"This is the only place where cecina (similar to beef jerky) can be found. It is not cheap, but it's delicious fried in a taco with chorizo and avocado.  If you are lucky to find the cactus-aloe vera tea: buy it! It's ideal for detox. I also acquired a pineapple tea I got obssesed with, but I haven't found those treats again... Please Tierra Azteca, bring them back!  They have fresh cactus (if they could remove the turns would be great!), cambray onions (perfect for bbq), avocados, fresh cream, panela cheese; lots of Mexican supplies you can order by season.  Although I haven't tasted their food, the restaurant section looks folkloric: cashier at the entrance, piñatas, Spanish spoken. Some week ago they had mariachis playing live, balloons, plenty of ppl (who made me want to join the celebration). Fiesta, flashy decorations, laughter! Good environment for an authentic Mexican place."}
{"text":"Looking really nice after renovations - spacious, bright and cheerful. The food is excellent and tastes authentic. We had tacos al pastor ($12) and pozole con arroz ($12+2). The tacos did not break easily and the filling was really nice. They provide fresh (what seems to be in-house-made) salsa verde. The service is good and server is friendly."}
{"text":"Never return to eat at this place, and ordered pozole was horrible, (I never found corn) After I asked for an order of gorditas and tacos al pastor, the gorditas were raw and the tacos were pieces of fat and very large pieces, I really disappointed, the service is always lousy, before attending this place for barbecue but the last time, the waitress asked Why upset a glass of water and ice (it was summer), and the service is really very very bad and not worth paying for bad food and bad service!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. This places used to be a fantastic place but not anymore. I used to come to enjoy Barbacoa and tacos on the weekend and really enjoying it.  However, the last times I came during weekdays the food was terrible.  All heated in the microwave, tasteless, in general a bad food experience.  Customer service is great but I wont be coming back..."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place since it was the closest to real Mexican food. The past couple of times I have been there the food is not the same. Too salty, cold tacos and the tortillas brake since they have been heat up in the microwave. Tamales the same thing super tasteless. Super sad, not planning on going back!"}
{"text":"This is not real Mexican food, is overpriced the food is nasty and the service is really poor"}
{"text":"This used to be a great authentic Mexican restaurant, with barbacoa (sheep) and carnitas (porc) on weekends. However, they expanded and their quality went down. Now they're famous for their 1/4 kilo orders that are not a 1/4 of a kilo (and a little pricey). In general its quality is not good any more, but I would be ok to go again just knowing what to expect."}
{"text":"Like other yelpers say, most authentic Mexican food in the GTA. Best barbacoa, hands down (only available on weekends) Be ready to wait for little bit.  I'm born and raised in Mexico and this place makes amazing Mexican food. Every time I feel nostalgic about the food back home, I simply hike over to Bloor and Dufferin for my barbacoa treatment.  My favorites are Chilaquiles, huaraches, menudo (pancita), the barbacoa and carnitas. Definitely worth the trek."}
{"text":"5 stars for authentic, home-style Mexican food in the 416.  I've passed by this nondescript bakery/grocery store/money transfer outlet many times without giving it much thought. Add to that, they advertise that they sell Injera! Talk about a cosmopolitan hodge-podge!  My mind made up, I walked in one Sunday and asked the guy at the cash if they sold tacos; he pointed me towards the space at the back: an elongated stretch of chairs and tables where a few people were noshing. I've been back since, for their exemplary, clean Mexican cooking.  The first time I went, I managed to order (I don't speak Spanish) the carnita tacos. The delicious, flavored shredded pork came in a plate; the heavenly fresh, warm, soft and pliant tortilla shells ( about 6-7) came wrapped in a warm towel and accompanied by a bowl of tres spicy salsa and lime, onions and cilantro. I had a great time playing around with the ingredients to make delicious tacos.  The meat absorbed the flavor of the onions, salsa and lime perfectly. I wasn't too chuffed about the cilantro though. I was absolutely stuffed and very content by the time I was done eating and. Really amazing tacos on Bloor! All this food for just $12!  My second time around I ordered the chicken in adobo: moist quarter chicken smothered in adobo sauce, with a side of beans, rice and garden salad. This dish was also accompanied by a pile of warm, fresh tortillas wrapped in a towel. I was in a heavenly food coma after this meal as well. My bill came to a paltry $10.   The servers are sweet Spanish speaking ladies who are attentive and fast workers. The owner is a great guy as well: the first time around he allowed me to come back to pay for my meal since they don't accept credit cards (only cash or debit). The food is consistently delicious, always fresh and a slice of Mexicana in the west end! I am going to keep going back until I've tried everything on their menu. And then some."}
{"text":"REAL STREET TACOS. REAL TACOS IN TORONTO. Okay, way more expensive than out of the trucks in Oakland, but it's worth it to taste home. I always get carnitas.  Star off because service is very slow and they aren't good at explaining you have to pay at the cash after eating. I'd like to say that's just how it is, but guys, it's not like this at hole in the wall places in California. Still, I tell everyone to go there if they want real Mexican food made by people who speak Spanish and not hipsters \"improving\" upon my culture. Trendy tacos may be delicious, but nothing beats real."}
