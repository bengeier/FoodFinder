{"text":"We went there on a Sunday morning, and it was pretty busy. I've hear great things about their croissants and they definitely did not dissapoint! We got 2 each of the butter, almond and chocolate raspberry croissants, as well as a pistachio bear claw. They were all delicious. The pastry was crisp on the outside and melt in your mouth tender on the inside. They had a whole display case of other pastries. I wanted to try their coffee but we were in a hurry. I can't wait to go back to try the coffee and the other items, especially the spinach and feta croissant! So glad I finally got to try out this place."}
{"text":"The place was in the middle of nowhere (I mean the bakery should have been in a better known place!) Once you get inside the store, the interior isn't the best but they have a few tables for you to dine in. They offer quiet a lot of variety of the bakery and pastries (macarons, croissant, bread, cake, cookies, sandwiches, salad, etc.) The prices were not that bad either. The macarons were $1.85 each and their cake were 3.50 on average. The macarons were \"good\" i think i waited too long to eat them so they were a little hard but they aren't too bad. HOWEVER, the CROISSANT.. my god! They were SOO GOOD. I waited a few afters after I bought them and they tasted like they just came out of the oven! Give those bad boys a try! The service was amazing as well. The guy that was helping me was very friendly. He was smiling, giving suggestions, and gave me as much time. The only bad thing is there were so many customers but only one person working. Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of sweets to fill you to your heart's content!! Really enjoyed their lemon macaron. Also tried a few of their cakes but found that the Opera cake was too sweet-- it would've tasted a lot better without as much sugar or at the very least with darker chocolate to balance the sweet factor. This place is in a convenient location and especially easy to find if you know the area. They have good seating as well, this would be nice to go for a coffee or tea with a friend and dessert! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great bakery in Mississauga, if not just a bit hidden in a plaza! So glad my friend recommended coming here. Although it is a little out of the way for me I still came. Tip. Get the macaroons! mmmm Cant wait to get back. They also offer a lot of hot drinks and tonnes of baked goods."}
{"text":"This bakery is amazing. I buy whole grain bread from here almost weekly and it is fluffy and delicious. I also really like the tiramisu, berry torte, napoleon cake, carrot cake. Great selection and I can't wait to try more of their cakes. Staff are very courteous. I ordered the white chocolate strawberry shortcake for a family birthday and that was also delish. The bakery uses organic and plant based ingredients which is wonderful."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this bakery! When I first walked in I was welcomed by a young gentleman at the front. He suggested a latte and an almond croissant as a small treat. The croissant was delicious and the latte was perfection. I definately reccomend this hidden treasure!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed about the assorted cakes I bought this Saturday April 23,2016. All of those pieces of cakes were old, dry and stale (carrot cake, tiramisu, eclair coffee, and layers cake with custard- suppose to be crunchy but instead it was soft and dry).  I won't come back for sure with that bad quality even on weekend not week day! What a waste of my money!"}
{"text":"There Macroon 's are the best, rose and pistachio ones are my favorite. My friend had told me about this place and I definitely recommend it to all of my friends."}
{"text":"Went there to try the macaroons. I was expecting a great fresh flavour and found them to be just ok. Small pieces and expensive too ($1.95 each)"}
{"text":"AMAZING almond croissants, all of their breads (faves are: olive bread, jalepeno tomato basil, pumpernickel and white chocolate loaf) desire cake is delicious haven't tasted anything like it everything really just make sure you ask when the macaroons were made if it was made too recent they haven't had enough time to soften. used to be a hit or miss when they first made them but when they are a hit they are the best in the GTA hands down (better than butter avenue and other macaroon specialty stores) now they are getting more consistent with the macaroon quality (I assume because it gained popularity and turnover is faster"}
{"text":"Yummy croissants!   Haven't tried other pastries, but in my opinion good french bakery starts with delicious croissant!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The cakes are so delicious. We usually get cakes and pastries from here for all special occasions."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Jersey and it's been a while since I experienced great tasting pastries! My cousin, Genny, keeps bringing me these adorable looking and delicious ones every time she comes to visit! This is my new \"to go\" place when I get invited anywhere and need to bring dessert (yes I was taught to never come empty handed! lol) and this will definitely \"wow\" your guests! Thanks cuz!! Simply awesome!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to places when I'm craving something sweet. Huge fan of their almond croissants in particular. They understandably run out quite quickly so it's worth going in early. Other delicious baked goods include the chocolate croissant and the spinach and feta croissants. I was a bit disappointed with the newly added hazelnut croissant, however it might be cos they've already set the bar high!  They also serve great coffee and have a formidable variety of rich & tempting desserts. Some, like their butter tarts, are delicious - but I found some others, like the cheesecake, not quite up to par. They also have gelato! Which is next on my list of things to try.   The staff is friendly, helpful and very patient - which helps when you're making up your mind. In general, it's a lovely tucked away neighbourhood coffee shop for an experience unlike any other in the city."}
{"text":"A nice concept, but lacking in quality. The croissant tasted dry, the apple turnovers sort of soapy. The chocolate croissant was pretty good, though. And as for the macaroons, their crust was much too thick, the ganache more of a foam, and the flavor, well, even though they looked beautiful and colorful, they all tasted the same: sweet but lifeless. Overall, their pastries look beautiful but don't taste flavorful. I was looking for a good, flakey, buttery croissant but I didn't quite find it."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise found in Mississauga. They offer probably the best croissants in the city."}
{"text":"Their croissants have changed my life; who needs to go to Paris when we have this gem right here in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"My God... Where do I begin to tell the story of how great a macaron can be. I don't need to tell a story, please visit french corner for your macaron fix. You will be hooked. I promise. The bread: olive bread - best ever. Took a baguette to work, people went crazy over it. Other pastries - simply amazing, especially the spinach and feta tart and the chock raspberry croissant and the almond croissant. Soup of the day is made from scratch and absolutely heartwarming and comforting. Love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing!! This is the only place in Mississauga and dare I say in the GTA and Toronto region to have great croissants, reminiscent of the beauties you find in Montreal. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a colleague.finally went there and it was awesome.we tried their tiramisu, mango cake, chocolate dome. each and every one was delicious. within a month went there few times . Highly recommend this place for delicious treats"}
{"text":"This is such a lovely place to catch up with a friend! They have so many cakes and pastries that it took quite a while to decide what to get. I got the \"Desire\" - a chocolate cake with raspberry mousse topped with berries, and my friend got a white chocolate & dark chocolate mousse cake. They were both weren't too sweet and you could tell it was freshly made. The \"Desire\" had a strong raspberry flavour (I couldn't taste much of the chocolate sponge) - but I really enjoyed it still! It was surprisingly big for a bakery, with lots of tables for in-store dining. Will definitely be coming back here to try more cakes and the croissants!"}
{"text":"Pumpkin and honey raisin bread are amazing! Real authentic french bread! You have no idea! How delicious this bakery is! Stop buying non authentic bread at your local super market. This bakery will enhance your health nutrition! Furthermore, just ate the cherry Danish. Wow the pastry it self is very tasty, crisp and buttery Danish. Along, with a fresh. Just an perfect breakfast on Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this bakery when I took my nephew to hockey practice at Huron Park; this was probably well over 10 years.  But I thought it had moved/left since it was located where there is now a bank in the corner of the plaza.  I was so excited to hear that it is still there and thriving.  I used to have a chocolate croissant every weekend; my sinful pleasure.  I will be coming back now that I know they are still in business because I have always described to my family and husband about my experience and that I had never been able to find a croissant anywhere near as delicious and crispy as the ones I used to purchase from the French Corner Bakery.  Tres Bien!"}
{"text":"Charming and adorable best macaroons in town really expensive though"}
{"text":"A hidden treasure in Mississauga, this bakery is truly passionate about everything it produces. We had a raspberry and strawberry fruit tart that had fresh fruit and a delicate chocolate topping. Their coffee is excellent and their cakes are works of art!!"}
{"text":"The best spot  for  macaroons in mississauga  great  little  bakery  the French  bread is  really  fresh.the bread  great  for  sandwiches"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning after seeing all the rave and hype.  Walked in around 12pm and ordered 3 of their butter croissants ($6). They were not warm, which I understand; as it was late in the morning. However, these croissants did not have the \"umph\" factor I look for in a good French croissant. I have had amazing ones in Paris and Montreal that have this buttery, flakey texture to them, and these croissants just did not have it.  Next time, I will try their almond and chocolate croissants, or even try their breakfast/brunch  3/5"}
{"text":"The good reviews took us to the store. We tried the croissant, chocolate cake and sticky bun. Personally don't like the sticky bun at all cause it was just toooo sweet (almost choked). Loved there croissants-- they probably make the best croissant in Sauga, must try! And the chocolate cake has fudge layers in between the spongy& moist cake layers, and the chocolate taste and aroma was very strong and pleasant, very tasty! Planning to get back and try their eclairs."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some macaroons and found that the electricity was out. This concerned me as the cafe was a bit humid and I was wondering how long the pastries had been sitting in the display cases. The macaroons were average, seemed very soft. This could have been due to the heat."}
{"text":"2.5 stars based on the macarons only. I found some of the macarons lacked freshness and had an old \"fridgey\" taste. I probably wouldn't go back if macarons were the only thing they sold -- HOWEVER, their desserts look amazing. Also, when you first walk in, all you smell is delicious butteriness and they have a lovely selection of fresh baked breads. The prices are decent and the service was decent (not too friendly but not mean either). I will go back someday to try their other offerings and perhaps they'll bump up a star or two afterwards!"}
{"text":"Very good cafe with a variety of desserts and a coffee that may be the best in the area."}
{"text":"Super charming little cafe that's tucked away in an unassuming little plaza. When stepping through the doors, one is greeted with the most mouth watering aromas of freshly baked breads and pastries. The cafe offers a wide selections of artisan breads, cookies, croissants, sandwiches, cakes, and tarts. I believe they offer coffees and drinks as well.   My recommendation - go for the almond croissant!! One of my absolute faves. Last time I managed to snag one fresh out of the oven, so gooey and sweet! *insert heart eyes emoji* The fruit tarts and sandwiches are great too.   There always seems to be a streaky stream of people coming through the door, but it's never much of a wait!"}
{"text":"Great place stop by for a cup of coffee and European breakfast. Croissants are awesome"}
{"text":"We totally loved their fresh yummy desserts and were impressed by the great collection they have .. me and my guest enjoyed it! It's my place to go for dessert and pastries.."}
{"text":"We ordered all the of the macaron flavours. My favourite macaron was the pistachio one. This wasn't too sweet and the pistachio flavour came through. They were good still not the best I've tried.   I did enjoy the Almond croissant here. It was flaky and had great Almond flavour. I'd order this again.  We also ordered the pistachio mousse cake, which was nice and creamy, but it was a bit too sweet for me. They have a lot of cute looking cakes, pastries, pies."}
{"text":"Cute little place! Average drinks but at good prices! Veryyy yummmyyy macaroons the salted caramel macaroons are delicious and vanilla! Those are the two I tried! Very good variety of pastries! Can't wait to try them!"}
{"text":"We got some loaves of bread, croissants and macaroons here.   I'd say this one is okay as a neighborhood bakery but definitely far from the best, or among the better ones, in any of the categories: bread, croissant or macaroon.  I didn't get to try the cakes though, and they do look tempting."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and lunch.  The pastries , almond croissant among others are really yummy.  Definitely a place to visit. Oh and the best part is it is halal."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! It's like Delysees in Toronto, but more fairly priced :)   Dark chocolate mousse - 9/10  Pecan butter tart - 10/10   They have a wide variety of desserts, croissants, coffees & tea options + a nice casual seating area   Love it! Will definitely come back here whenever we are in the area.  Stocked up on some cookies & croissants, haven't tried them yet"}
{"text":"This is a reasonable sized bakery hidden in a plaza at approximately Dundas and Erindale station road and have been here a few times for their macaroons.  I've tried macaroons from a place in the Distillery district, Longos and Whole Foods.  They weren't worth $2.00 for a small little cookie at these places as you could almost tell they were mass produced in a factory or weren't fresh.    However at French Cornery Bakery, you can taste how delicate, crispy and fresh they are.  Like another person said, the pistachio one is the best as it has a good nutty yet sweet flavour.  Verdict: Great little bakery."}
{"text":"Great little family run place. An absolute gem. Great prices too. All baked goods made on premise."}
{"text":"Get the desert called Desire.  It is out of this world.  It is perfect balance between sweet, tart and savory.  My wife and I have been here over 10 times and it is our favorite desert place in mississauga.  We tried other items and they were pretty good, but ask for desire.  You will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Hands down the best butter croissants in the city and could easily stand up to most bakeries in France.   Their chocolate croissants, spinach and feta croissants, are equally delicious and well-made.  Service is usually prompt, there's seating inside and out, and the coffee is good and appropriately priced."}
{"text":"Bread is great here and so are their cakes.  Love the macaroon also.    They also make cakes to order.  I had ordered two cakes with a white plain chocolate ganache on the outside and then decorated them at home myself for my kids first communion.   They cost me $35/ea for a delicious cake and some time/effort.  To order each cake like I made would of been $150+/ ea."}
{"text":"I got a chance to try their baked goods! Result? They get bumped up to a full five stars in my books.   Meringue, cinnamon bun, sticky bun, chocolate croissant, butter croissant, tiramisu, apricot tart, pecan butter tart, white chocolate loaf, IT'S ALL GOOD.   Check out my previous edition of my review for my opinion on the macarons.   One of the best bakeries in Mississauga, bar none."}
{"text":"I love this bakery! We get almost all of our birthday cakes from here and have never been disappointed. Everything is fresh. The Treasure Island and Desire are particular favourites. Instead of buying one big cake, my family likes to get a bunch of different small ones to accommodate for everyone's tastes. If you do this, they will still do the traditional writing on chocolate squares."}
{"text":"Hidden gem alert!! You could easily drive by and be completely unaware of the amazing deliciousness of French Corners bakery. The pistachio bear claw and kouing amann were very tasty. It wasnt a strong pistachio flavour but was still really good. The glaze on both were really nice and not too sweet. The meringues are amazing, esp the raspberry flavour. We bought some to go and tried one in the parking lot after lunch and actually went back in to buy 10 more! Really nicely done. The lemon flavour was also really night and delicate and surprisingly had such an amazing lemony flavour. (The orange and vanilla one was good but the raspberry and lemon were the top favourites.) There's also beautiful one-serving fancy desserts - the Desire 3 and a slice of the raspberry roll cake were so delicious and bursting with flavour. Will definitely be back to try all the other desserts and bread, which looked soooooo good!!"}
{"text":"The place is filthy. From the counters, to the walls, to the tables and chairs, to the washrooms. There is also so much dust everywhere near the ceilings. It's very disgusting. What you see on the outside must give you a good idea of how clean it is in the kitchen. It took my appetite away and as much as it could be a cute bakery I won't be going back. I know you're busy but, have someone clean after the shop closes, or in the morning before your guests arrive, and every hour in between. Cleanliness should be #1."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite bakeries in the GTA.  It's a gem of a bakery in \"deep Mississauga\".  I would come in on weekends to have their amazing coffee with either a chocolate croissant or one of their many cakes.  One of my faves was the pistachio cake with the incredibly airy sponge cake and creamy butter cream icing.  (One year, this is all I asked for my birthday!) My Mom's fave is the mango mousse cake.   She said it actually tasted like mangoes.   I've since moved far away and miss thus bakery so much."}
{"text":"Loved it here. The bread and their desserts were made well. But they seem more of a dessert place if anything.. they also sell some breads but the quantity wasn't a lot when we got there which was understandable.  Their store is nice and clean and there are a few tables if you want to dine inside. It's a quaint atmosphere to be honest and I dig that kind of vibe. Staff is lovely and nice as well. Why haven't I discovered this place sooner is beyond me.  I ordered a slice of tiramisu and red velvet cake and it was yummy. Not too sweet or not \"too\" of anything which a bunch of places tend to do that. There was a bunch of other sweets available and am curious to try next time.  We also tried their cajun chicken sandwich that came with a salad (tell them to go easy on the dressing, ours had a little too much and it was not good) but the sandwich itself was good and the bread paired with it is perfect.    Will come back here soon when I want some good bakery and sweets."}
{"text":"Mon Dieu! This place is the best. Amazing cakes, and bakery treats. Fresh bread and sandwiches. I am so happy I found this place. I will never buy a cake at a supermarket again."}
{"text":"Best bakery I have been to so far. I googled the best bakeries in Mississauga and this one showed up so I went there to get a birthday cake for my family. The cake didn't disappoint us at all and it was so so so good. We also bought some almond croissants which were crispy and tasty. I am so happy I found this place and I will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Great food and they have a newer seating area. The best include their sandwiches and their desserts. The people who serve you can sometimes be rude or cold but in general the service is ok."}
{"text":"I love getting cakes here for special occasions! People always ask me where I get it from!   I suggest trying their white chocolate pistachio cake, all the different pastries and try their bearclaw with pistachio and chocolate!  Friendly staff and cute little cafe!"}
{"text":"Your eyes glaze over when you see the variety of pastries available at this place - it's probably the most comprehensive bakery located in Mississauga to date. From meringues, to éclairs, to a large variety of macaroons, to traditional pastries, not to mention the availability of hot drinks and sandwiches.   Overall, what a nice spot and a great little corner in Mississauga. They've renovated this place in the last couple of years, and it went through quite a face lift - nice seating, relaxing café environment, and very spacious.   On a recent visit, we ordered: a) a latte, b) a chocolate croissant, and c) a sticky bun. The latte and the sticky bun were just okay (I found the sticky bun to be way too dense and hard for my liking, but that's personal preference, I guess). However, the chocolate croissant was the star - soft, flakey, buttery, but still substantial - absolutely delicious. On a Saturday morning, it was quite busy, with customers leaving the spot with boxes of pastries to take home. Overall, a nice environment for patrons of all ages, with some pastries better than others (based on my personal preference anyway).   For two people, with tax, our total came to $8.75."}
{"text":"Heard many great thing about their macaroons so went there just to try them. It's 1.85 a macaroon, and if you buy more than 6, you pay no tax; which is great if you love macaroons.   Once you enter, you're attracted by all their pastries and macaroons. The girl at the counter was more than helpful, smiley and very friendly.  The macaroons were great! I mean not \"Laduree, Paris\" great but were good enough. They were a little bit cold for my liking as well.  I decided to try all the flavours, they have a total of I think 11 flavours.  Definitely recommend the salted caramel, it was DELICIOUS! In second place their pistachios!  Will definitely be back to try the pastries."}
{"text":"The BESTESTEST.  Try the almond cross when they are hot or you can ask them to warm it up in the oven.. They're cakes slices are all brilliant,  and the pistachio mousse, carrot cake is to die for  Best sandwiches are muffalata and Cajun chicken.. All their soup of the days are yummm Can't have enough of the place!"}
{"text":"This bakery is definitely a hidden treasure in Mississauga.   I dropped by randomly one day after some errands and boy was a pleasantly surprised! I bought a dozen French Macrons and my friend and I just chowed down on these delicious little desserts! They have an amazing variety of flavors and some of them very unique but not disappointing. My personal favorite was the orange flavor which was the perfect blend of zesty/sweet. The price point is up there but its definitely worth it for those out there who are into adorable little desserts."}
{"text":"PROS: - Halal!!! - Nice and chic decor - Front staff was very nice and helpful - Lots of good looking pastries, cakes, cookies, etc. - Nice sitting area for parties of two - good options of sandwiches   CONS: - Cookies did not taste fresh... - Black chocolate desert didn't taste fresh... - Beef sandwich did not have taste (I think the bread they used was very over powering. That said, we are from the East and like spices in our food, which is a major reason for this comment. If you are born/raised in the West, I am sure you will not agree with this particular Con :)  TO THE OWNER: You've done a terrific job making this place Halal. May God Bless you and your family for bringing very comparable eateries for our community. :)"}
{"text":"Great selection of bread, baked goods, and delectable sweets. The baker is a very friendly guy; very knowledgeable with his products and customer service oriented. From previous reviews, I was expecting the macarons (1.75) to be a fair size, and they were the same size as from Nadege (maybe now made smaller?). Nonetheless, they were very good. I had the raspberry ones and they tasted like the actual fruit. The ganache was obviously made with raspberry puree; a nice balance of tart and sweet. The meringues (1.50) were also very nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible! Just the smell of their freshly baked bread makes it worth the visit. The owner is very friendly and welcoming. He makes you feel at home. I have been a few times and the bear claw is definitely my favorite. Unfortunately they sell out fast though so go back if you don't get a chance to try it the first time. I always felt something missing in my life until I ate a bear claw. Eating the pistachio filled pastry really touched me in my heart. The flaky crust and green filling still gives me butterflies."}
{"text":"I have tried this place various times for years now. I am a big fan of authentic French pastries in general. I have stopped to pickup viennoise (croissants dough pastries) from time to time. Unfortunately, I felt bad only giving them only a 3 star. The technic used for the pastries and cakes is indeed authentic and higher in quality than 96%  of bakeries in Mississauga. However their turnover is not that fast for them to have fresh tasting pastries or cakes.   On the viennoise side,croissants etc, they are pretty much fresh and decent tasting for Mississauga. (Not much options out there). On the cakes, petit four and macaroons side though, it's a big disappointment. They all taste like they have been previously frozen for months and have absorbed all the nasty food smell a freezer holds. The sad part is that all of these cakes probably tasted amazing as fresh products. I always support them, but over the last couple months I have stayed away from their macaroons and cakes. My other issue is that that make great quiches but when you buy them, they reheat them in a microwave over. The texture is utterly ruined. I would rather they have less cake varieties and selection, but that they taste fresher and that they invest in a speed oven to reheat items like quiches. This best should work on improving. They will definitely get a 5 *. I will keep on checking them out when in the area."}
{"text":"Skip:  Flaky pastries and macarons.  Croissants, bear claws, and anything on the left of the cash register are too heavy, not flaky and light as they're supposed to be.  They taste fine, but just not the right texture.    I don't think the macarons are made on-site.  I haven't had one in a while, but their strength lies in their cakes - everything on the right of the cash register.  Owner can be friendlier.  Each time I go in and greet him, he grunts, and looks miserable.  The rest of the staff have been fine."}
{"text":"Made a trek out here thanks to yelp and an insatiable craving for a good croissant. I was really impressed with the selection. It will be a couple trips more before I try everything I want to! Everything from pastries to assorted breads to intricate desserts and cupcakes. I tried quite a few things, because the affordable prices allowed for it. I had the croissant and chocolate croissant, which were both really good but not the best I've had. I did not care for the spinach and feta croissant. Also several flavours of macaron; I'm not a big macaron person but these were about as good as I've had and I did quite enjoy the guava one; it had an almost gummy filling. I had a meringue, which was very good -- good balance of crunchy and chewy. This will now be my go-to bakery as nothing in Mississauga compares. It's a bit of a drive from me but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions to get my sweet tooth fix and I love it. Upon entering there's a wonderful scent of warm, buttery goodness and service is always friendly.   The display with all their freshly baked items always looks amazing. If you're looking for macarons but don't want to head all the way downtown, this is the place. Definitely going to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Best variety in Mississauga. Great deals on macaroons, although the pastries are a bit pricey. The only drawback is the quality of chocolate used in pastries - very cheap."}
{"text":"I went to get macaroons and they are good but some you bite in and taste like a rock CRUNCHY! Not soft I wouldn't go back here again!"}
{"text":"Came by to grab a few desserts before going to class.  They offer a variety of different desserts. They have macarons, cakes, cupcakes, croissants, coffee and sandwiches.     As I was eating my cake I noticed that inside one of my berries there was something greyish black. I believe it's mould? Something that I was not expecting. Unexpected and disturbing. Thought that their desserts would be fresher.   Not coming back here ..."}
{"text":"The coffee was great! I ordered a decaf americano and a latte. Both were great! The almond croissant was ok, my friend ordered one and I tried it. But the pearl tart was too cold and didn't feel as fresh and pleasant as the croissant. The quality is good (except for the pearl tart which was a disappointment and nothing special) , but a bit pricey compared to the portion size and other places."}
{"text":"Can you hear this? Yes, it's an angel playing a harp because you're in heaven, AKA French Corner Bakery.  Their croissants are to die for. Best ever. Ever, ever. Crispy and flakey on the outside, soft and chewy inside. I'm serious here. If you buy their croissants and you don't like them (because you're obviously crazy), please send me a message. I'll give you my address and take them off your hands. I'll eat them all, no problem. Kidding! (maybe)  Their baguettes are ah-mazing (both white and whole wheat). Their pastries look so pretty that you almost don't want to eat them. I tried tiramisu, opera cake and divine (raspberry mousse). I didn't really like the opera cake but who cares, it's all about the bread and croissants anyway!  Next time I'm there (probably later this week), I'll get some macaroons. They have many flavours to choose from and even though I'm not normally a fan of macaroons, I'm almost positive that I will like them. They just look, oh, so tempting.  French Corner Bakery also offers light lunch - soups, salads and sandwiches. We had sandwiches with salad and they were pretty tasty.   As a side note, please keep in mind that this place is a bit hard to find, as it's located at a small plaza that doesn't really stand out when you drive by. I must have passed by this place so many times and I've never noticed it until someone pointed it out to me. However, even if you don't live in the neighbourhood, you should try to go there some time (or tomorrow). It'll be totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Every time we'e gone we've tried something new, and it's always great! Customer service is great, and the pricing is very reasonable. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! One of the best croissants I have ever had. The coffee is great as well. If you go early on Saturday (before 9 am) you can get a seat. Otherwise it usually gets pretty packed."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the soup and sandwich deals were great, but the best part was the dessert...  the best desserts in the gta!!!"}
{"text":"We've been to French Corner for drinks and pastries a couple of times now.   There's always a nice assortment of treats, from individual cheesecakes, to croissants, to macarons and plenty of other things. The pastries we've tried have all been pretty good (last time was a pear tart and a flaky, layered something or other) but the macarons are the real stars here. Maybe not as good as a Nadège or Butter Avenue, but pretty darn yummy. And it's so nice not to have to go all the way downtown for macarons!  The mocha lattes are also very delicious and not too sweet at all (pairs so well with a sweet treat).   The staff are friendly and welcoming and the place usually isn't too busy so we've always managed to get a seat.   We haven't tried the sandwiches on homemade bread, or the salads but they always look lovely and fresh.  The parking lot is shared with a few other businesses, but we've never had a hard time finding a parking spot. Oh, and there's free wi-fi and they have no problem with us sitting there for an hour or so with our laptops."}
{"text":"The interior needs an upgrade. Lots of dessert options.   Indian lady didnt smile once, wasnt friendly and was rushing me to put in an order and pay when there was only one person after me. Hardly had a chance to browse. It was dumb and annoying of her. If she gave me at least one or two minutes to look around I would have bought more and maybe I would have returned. But that probably won't happen now. Who doesn't give a customer more time to look and buy more product??  Bought the mini round dark chocolate mousse cake. It was good.  Also bought the almond croissant and it wasn't dry."}
{"text":"In an early Sunday morning haze, I was driving about before heading to a class.  I wanted to kill time so I checked Yelp and spotted this Bakery is open.  I've heard how great this place was through a few people so I wanted to explore it myself.  At  the first crack of the door, you're surrounded by the wonderful smells of butter, flour, and caramelized sugars.  I took a few pictures and I can tell you this is a real bakery.  My apple turnover was hot out of the oven and was filled with real apples.  There was actual chunks and it wasn't sugary sweet. It was a perfect balance of shatteringly crispy pastry, lightly sweetened apple filling, and warm cinnamon flavour.    I also got macarons, americano coffee, and a fresh croissant.  The Americano was bold but not bitter.  The croissant was probably the best I've tasted west of the 427.  I'm surprised on the flakey texture and great layering. Whoever is baking definitely knows their way around butter and flour.  The pistachio macaron tasted of the nut itself and wasn't some sugary nutty fake concoction.  It had that perfect meld of chewy meringue inside, crackly sweet exterior, and a creamy mildly sweet buttercream.  Honestly... it's a steal at $1.75 because it took 3 bites to eat it all.  I bought some at Ruelo bakery in Toronto and I can eat those in one bite.  The Passionfruit chocolate was really nice too.  It did taste like the tropical fruit without the nasty kabillion seeds and the chocolate was a dark chocolate flavour.  Honestly... these macaron can compete with Toronto's good bakeries.  The service was probably the best out of any I've experienced in GTA. When we first walked in, we immediately were greeted by the friendly baker.  There's no pretentious attitude here.  He explained all the flavours and offered items that were just out of the oven.  Friendly, jovial, and a morning person serving at a FRENCH bakery.... Nearly an oxymoron!   I think I found my favourite French bakery in GTA West.  With Lazio Italian bakery and French Corner, I'm quite a happy camper. I do think French Corner has the better croissant and pastries but Lazio has cannoli and tiramisu.  They both have great bread.  If I had to decide on bakery alone, I'd say French Corner is better because they have more variety and they're organic.  The macaron at French Corner are definitely Mississauga's best."}
{"text":"Amazing macrons. Pastries are fresh and made of great ingredients. No too sweet so you can actually taste other ingredients. Wish the decor was cozier so we could relax but it's really more functional."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Omg! Comparable to Pattiserie 27 in west Toronto.  Chocolate hazelnut croissant, excellent.  Desire, chocolate cake layered with beautiful fresh fruit, awesome! Praline, dipped in chocolate and awesome.  Opera cake, wonderful! White chocolate mousse, yummy!  The vanilla, orange and raspberry merengues are awesome!  Can't wait to try the macaron!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the only gluten free item on their menu: macaroons. They're delicious! Moist, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I tried guava, pistachio, vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, and caramel and loved them all."}
{"text":"Pistachio mousse!!!!!!! Oh my!!! I just had the pistachio mousse cake for my birthday with family and friends and it was delicious!!! One of a kind - everyone loved it! Can't wait to try more ! :)"}
{"text":"Here's a quick breakdown: croissants are out of this world and baked to perfection; light and flaky on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside.  Their almost croissants are a favourite with my hubby and I.  Kids go gaga for their plain croissants as well as their chocolate filled ones.  Their pastries are just so-so IMO.  I prefer Italian or Portuguese variety but that's just me n' my family's preference.   Oh ya, their breads and macarons also rock!   PS- service could stand to come with a smile as well (lady behind the counter lacks in personality esp when dealing with public).  Even when I said \"have a good day\" I didn't get nada back and I regularly drop $30 there just in croissants.  Maybe a drop in the bucket for some, but a smile or nod to your customers never hurts."}
{"text":"Great little shop in a plaza that's easy to find. I came into the shop and went straight to the amazing selection of macarons to the left. They were gorgeous and it wasn't long before someone came to help me. I got one of each of the 12 flavours they had at $1.95 which is not a bad price for them considering I have paid up to $2.75 each before. The cute gold box they had awkwardly was big enough for 16 macarons and due to my slight OCD I had to get the 16 which came up to $31.20.  Oh my goodness, my first bite of the passionfruit macaron was soo good. I didn't eat the entire box in one sitting but I really wanted to. I didn't care much for guava and the rose water one tasted like soap to me :( I got it just to try it but I regret that decision. I'm guessing rose water is an acquired taste that I don't have.  I would definitely come back here next time for my macaron craving."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything is so fresh and delicious. I've been tempted by all kinds of evil treats and given in to most of them.   I haven't been able to pick a favorite yet but I'm willing to try them all again in an attempt to select a fav. The bread makes the car smell so good.   Parking is fine and although very small, I am always able to get a table. The coffee is delicious. The staff is friendly.   Definitely my go to for breads and pastries.  Had to update this to give a shout out to the macaroons. Yum! If nothing else, go in for some macaroons."}
