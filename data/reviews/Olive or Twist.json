{"text":"My husband and I waited until after 10pm to come here because it was busy for a private event! I had my eyes set on the short ribs which is basically roast!!!!!! Yes roast! Enough said not impressed not happy and being we came up from Syracuse we obviously will never return! $70 bill and it wasn't good at all!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was there in November 2009, what a great little place! It's laid out like a shotgun house, long and narrow, and it fills up pretty quickly at night, but if you appreciate industrial spaces, exposed brick, etc., you'll really dig the vibe at this place. Plus, they had the Great Lakes Christmas Ale on tap, just when other places were running dry of it, so it got extra points for that! Calamari is pretty good, service was excellent. If i had one criticism, it's that the place is bit *too* dark, even for a bar -- but very clean!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the calamari. It's so good and spicy. There is an endless list of martinis and one is better than the next. There is a first and second floor, if you prefer more of a bar or lounge atmosphere. It's not a place I like for dinner, but for drinks and apps it's wonderful."}
{"text":"Half price apps at happy hour? I'm always a fan of that.  Pretty good live music?  I'll take it.  Nice location near the theater before the show?  Done and done.  I'd be back."}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday celebration and since no one other than me frequents downtown I was in charge of dinner reservations.  There were 5 of us going to the Pittsburgh Symphony for a sold-out show so I called to make a reservation weeks prior to the event.  When we arrived on Saturday night we were told we did not have a reservation (turned out they had us in for the wrong night).  The manager was nice but the only dinner option they could offer was sitting on couches in the lounge.  She did offer our group a round of drinks and an appetizer.  I have to say, although I did appreciate the offer of drinks etc, it is highly disappointing to plan a night out and have to order a $20+ entree to hold on your lap and eat.  In addition, I made it known to the Server and Manager that it was my friends bday and neither acknowledged it.  I have never been to a place where they didn't acknowledge a bday and at least bring a scoop of ice cream or something for the person.  The food was ok and when we received our check we were charged for the \"free\" appetizer and had to then ask for it to be taken off.    We made the best of it but will go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the service. Or I should say lack of. It literally killed me to leave a tip. No one deserves it. And I once tipped a server that never even waited on me before she left for the day. I overtip EVERYBODY and today it was all I could do to leave 20%."}
{"text":"I went here before the PSO last night using a certificate from restaurant.com (worth checking out!)  The food and drinks were fantastic! I had a cran-apple martini, which was perfect for the winter time and had a tasty apple inside. My grandmother had the crab cake sandwich, which was delicious - mostly crab and not much filler. I had the tomato basil soup (soooo good!) and the candied pear salad with chicken. Our food was delicious and was served in reasonable timing.  Most importantly, Olive or Twist had great service. We were originally seated at a table which was a little wobbly and continued to be bumped into by other guests, causing the martinis to spill on the table. The staff took care of the situation and immediately grabbed us another table (which was no easy feat as it was crowded for a Sunday night).   I will definitely be back to Olive or Twist."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!! Menu choices varied and even the chef came out to talk with us.  He said they are in the process of revising the menu.  I hope not too soon as I intend to come back for some of the existing items.  Service was excellant and martini was very good as was the pricing.  Definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Love their Martinis! The birthday cake martini is my fav. It's a good place to go after work to hang out for a few hours. Like the upstairs vibe more."}
{"text":"At the request of a friend, we had a brief girls night out at Olive or Twist. My first impression was the outdated decor. The restaurant has carpet which I find off putting. The drink menu is extensive; but, with the exception of one person in my party, we each found our drinks far too sweet. I ordered the cucumber basil martini, which was so sweet I had to send it back. The food was mediocre. I ordered the burger medium and it was over cooked to nearly well done. And then there was the cheesy lounge singer who sang a mishmosh of singer songwriter tunes from the 80s. The music was so loud and so bad that my friends I left and headed down the street to Butcher and the Rye."}
{"text":"We need a private room for about 50 people that were attending a convention nearby and after calling around to about a dozen places I settled on Olive or Twist. The rental room fee was reasonable, Brandon was easy to work with (even tweaked the food order, cutting it back when does that happen). The space was great and the staff professional. He made my job so easy."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  The martini was weak, but the food was good overall."}
{"text":"Visited with a party of 8 last weekend for a friend's birthday. We walked in the door and could see no apparent host stand, so we tried the door next to the one we entered. This ended up leading to a private party. Can you say awkward?  We went back in the main door, clearly confused. The bartender looked at us but kept pouring drinks (rude!). Not even sure how we discovered it, but the host stand was in the BACK of the restaurant. How were we supposed to know this? We were seated, and had to wait awhile for service.  Finally, the server came and took our drink orders and suggested a very strong drink for me. He was obviously trying to get me drunk (and succeeded). Caution: The Vesper is a strong *ss gin martini that is just okay. You pay 11 bucks to drink a shot of gin slowly from a fancy glass.   He then took our order...and did not think to write any of the 8 requests down. Yep, you guessed it. He screwed up our orders and bills, then proceeded to be rude about the situation.   The buffalo chicken dip is awesome, but be prepared, there is no chicken. We had one chunk in the two orders. The deep fried pita chips taste like donuts and are muy excellente.   Also, prepare yourself for bartenders squeezing caramel into glasses. The sound is reminiscent of flatulence. Over and over. So much flatulence.   I was too drunk and full of pita donuts to eat my dinner. The two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though.  Jesse from Bob Evans down the road is far superior to the condescending server here. We highly recommend Jesse."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I saw the menu for this place because they had some vegetarian items that sounded delicious. I liked the decor, with exposed brick walls, soft lighting and we went there on a night with live music. But the positives stop there. I had the veggie burger. The burger was the typical veggie burger that a lot of restaurants are trying now - with all of the veggies in the patty - and people continually make it mushy. The mushy texture made me nauseous so I didn't finish that. I got the side of garlic mashed potatoes, and I'm pretty confident those came out of a box, though that ended up being my favorite thing.   My date got nachos, which are advertised with lots of goodies on top. Lies! They were covered in melted but cold cheese, a sprinkle of diced tomatoes and a scoop each of guacamole and sour cream. Neither one of us ate more than 3 chips.   Finally, I ordered Patron with Rose's line juice. First sip... Completely bitter and disgusting! So I asked her. And she said, oh right, we don't have sweetened line juice, he probably just used lime juice. So I asked for her to add some simple syrup, which she did. And then it was drinkable. But come on. She should have thought of that upfront!   Don't go here for anything but the walls and music."}
{"text":"Good drinks &  the Yelp coupon made it that much better. If you're going for drinks, go with a small crowd for happy hour (or reserve a table). It can get crowded by the bar.  Great, friendly service! ... and did I mention happy hour?"}
{"text":"Very disapointing experience. I have ate here several times in the past and always liked it but this most recent dinner was very disapointing. It seems that they are sacrificing quality food and outstanding customer service to only over charge their customers. Food was very subpar, very small portions for the prices. Food did not taste fresh and was served cold. The server didn't go over any specials or happy hour prices and it was happy hour. We had to ask him for everything, like pulling teeth. Our bill was incorrect, we ordered appetizers that were listed on the menu as 1/2 off during happy hour but when I asked the waiter why they were full price on the bill he said that the menu was outdated and never offered to tell us that or fix the bill. That is called false advertising. He also rambled on about how the restaurant is losing money on the food they serve. Yes, he told a customer that as if it was my problem and should be expected to over pay for poor service and very low quality food. This makes sense to me now that I saw how skimpy they were on the portions. Very disapointing, we left hungry (bill was well over $125), won't be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful night on the patio enjoying a crab pesto pizza.  Crispy crust and delicious. My companion had the chicken and artichoke pizza which she enjoyed.  Service is very good.  I have the Lemon Ice martini which is very good as well.  A great experience overall."}
{"text":"It's been about 4 years since my initial review of Olive or Twist.  It is our \"go to\" place to eat when we attend shows/opera at the Benedum and Heinz Hall.  The food, drink and service are excellent.  Prices are also quite reasonable.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent martinis, nice atmosphere and the desserts are delicious. We also tried the nachos (do not get the nachos) they are very expensive and not good at all. Also the fries are tasteless. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place, perfect place to get drinks and dessert (not nachos).  Matt"}
{"text":"I had a really mixed experience here. Took the bf for dinner here before a show at Heinz Hall, which was really great for the convenience, they're so close to one another. We would definitely go back for lunch - GET THE TRUFFLE FRIES APPETIZER - and martinis someday, but never again for dinner. The entrees were expensive and nothing to rave about, and the service wasn't anything special. The dinners took forever to come out - I know it was a Saturday night, but we got there well over two hours early and were still worried about not getting to our show seats on time. It was a nice atmosphere, but one that we felt a little to young and poor for (we're still college students). I think I'd try somewhere else for a nice date night next time, but again, I will definitely go back to splurge some lunchtime on the cake batter martini, truffle fries, and other desserts and appetizers."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came to Pittsburgh for a girls weekend. We stopped here for a drink to get the night started. Drinks are on the expensive side and not really that fantastic.. Staff is very friendly though and they had live music which was fun too."}
{"text":"Great place. The drinks were good. But the band sucks. I didn't order any food so I'm not able to comment on that... however I can tell you that the bartender was friendly and that the place has a nice calming atmosphere.... besides the crappy music I have no complaints."}
{"text":"My first review since moving to Pittsburgh:   I came here last night, all suited up with essentially my entire grad class. That could explain the amazing treatment we received...but it was amazing treatment none-the-less and should be credited.   The management was more than happy to have an unexpected and large group arrive (~300) and supplied us with whatever was needed - be it more waitresses, bartenders, or access to the VIP lounge. So in all, the service really was great.   The space is just as good. It's clean, it's spacious, it's comfortable, and the music was just right.   The drinks were strong and quick to come.   Yeah, we had a great time there."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and martini menu here. Nothing like a Frosted Grape martini and exposed brick to make you feel like a class act. I've also enjoyed any sandwich or salad I've ever gotten here. Highly recommeded!"}
{"text":"I really like this bar . When we first went in there was no room at the downstairs bar so we went up to the very pretty bar that was not crowded at all. They had the same happy hour prices and  the service was great.."}
{"text":"Good drinks, but the food was marginally good. It was very loud as well. Great lighting, though."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I was very pleased both times. It's a great place for before or after dinner drinks. Good martinis and cocktails. Downstairs can be crowded but there's a roomier, quieter lounge upstairs."}
{"text":"I stopped in for an happy hour drink. This place was jammed pack no seating at the downstairs bar so I proceeded to the upstairs bar/lounge area. The upstairs has a bar and some couch seating areas that apparently u can reserve.... I ordered the chocolate covered pretzel martini which was very good. It took awhile for it to arrive but it was good. We ordered nachos as an appetizer and was very disappointed. They failed to put the salsa on them. Which I wasn't going to send them back because it took way to long for us to receive them. If you had a long day at work and want to sit at the bar and have a drink I would advise to get there super early or you'll be waiting for a seat and drinks."}
{"text":"I'll preface by saying it's been about 6 months from when we dined here, but our waiter and the rest of the staff were so good that I felt I still needed to give them a good review.   We arrived here before a show across the street and also had a groupon to accommodate. It took a little longer to be seated than we had anticipated but the wait staff was so accommodating and made sure to make recommendations on how long we had to eat. Fiancé and I both went for the crab cake sandwiches and they were delicious. We also couldn't get enough of the fries! We even made it out of there with just a little time to spare when we thought for sure we would end up being late. I really cannot say enough about our wonderful waiter and it is very sad that I can't seem to remember his name as it has been so long since we've been."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing Olive Or Twist strictly as a weekday lunch person.  I haven't had drinks there, or been there during an evening or weekend rush.  I absolutely love this place.  Its seating area is small - maybe seven or eight tables?  The lunch menu is delicious.  I get the grilled cheese and tomato soup every time, and it's perfect.  The friend I go with gets the French Dip and sings its praises all day long.  The prices are a bit on the high side - over $10 for lunch - but frankly, the food is so good I'm glad to pay the extra couple of dollars.    The bartender is always the same guy when I go, and if he's the only one up front who has to seat me I get a distinctly unhappy vibe off him.  Killing him with kindness does not work.  Other than him, the staff seems great, and I'm happy to give them my business."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The drinks are good and the location is perfect! Avoid whenever there are major events downtown though can get pretty wild"}
{"text":"I went here for a college alumni gathering on a Saturday, during the Three Rivers Art Fest. We were secluded in the upstairs area. I loved the atmosphere (very classy)  and the martinis (very unique and tasty). We dropped serious money on the drinks. We had a coupon from Foursquare for a free appetizer. I ordered the truffle fries, very delicious. I would recommend coming here for a cocktail or two, but if you're looking to put away some drinks, you could get more for your buck somewhere else. Then come here :)"}
{"text":"The saga continues...I did return to the restaurant without accepting Brandon's generous offer. All started about the same on Wednesday; the wine good, appropriately mature atmosphere and an attentive staff. Same order but different outcome I am please to say. The bed of greens was fresh and properly dressed and the salmon was done well and seasoned better than my prior visit. Perhaps it was an Ash Wednesday rush on salmon the last visit or a different cook, either way it was a far better meal! Moving to 3 stars overall, averaging against a 2 star initial visit."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The buffalo chicken spread and the jerked salmon are awesome. The service is always good especially at the bar. They have an upstairs lounge that is open for happy hour during the week. If you are looking to grab a few drinks after work with friends, the lounge upstairs is a good choice. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced with happy hour specials M-F. ($2 off all martinis and half price buffalo chicken spread)"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Olive or Twist before a Pirate Game. The food was delicious! I had the crab cake sandwich. The happy hour specials were also a plus. I had a cake batter martini which was tasty! The location is also convenient for anyone going to a game. We walked over Roberto Clemente bridge and were right there. We will definitely be going back! Great work Olive or Twist!"}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings coming here on a Monday night for dinner after hearing about a really bad experience a friend of mine had not too long ago. We had a groupon that my girlfriend had purchased and we had to use it because it was expiring that week. The place was a bit crowded nothing outrageous that would make us want to go somewhere else, we were actually seated within five minutes with no reservation so far so good right? Well that's where it ended. Our waitress was the textbook version of horrible service. Drinks took forever to be delivered to our table, my girlfriends food was cold, and she forgot the soup that we had ordered. The food itself was decent ( I had the pepper crusted salmon) and the drink was just \"meh\". I really don't feel sorry at all for our waitress all, her attitude was horrible, and she wasn't really busting her butt waiting on multiple tables. Let it be known, if you plan on taking orders without writing them down, you better be able to deliver. The \"acting manager\" sat down at our table and apologized and took an extra 15% off our bill. I couldn't wait to get out of there and don't have any plans on returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in town love the live music and the martinis - fave is the strawberry shortcake!"}
{"text":"This place was adorable. Very nice inside. Solid wood bar long L-shaped with chairs. They also had tables & chairs set up in the back half of the place for table seating. My co-worker and I sat at the bar close to the door and had a few drinks. They served food but we weren't offered a menu  (hence the 3 stars). The bartender wasn't very friendly-later I realize that was just her personality. Still not so cute! They have really good martinis. We had a s'mores which was awesome and came with a chocolate covered marshmallow. We also got a prickly pear. Mmmmmmmm is all I have to say. If I'm ever in Pitts again I would go back cause I know the drinks are very good! P. S. They also had an upstairs not sure what was going on up there. Thinking maybe it was a restaurant cause kids were going up with adults."}
{"text":"After hearing about their cocktails, some colleagues and I came hear work for dinner and drinks. The drink menu is very extensive with lots of interesting options. S'mores, and cotton candy cocktails do not appeal to me but my friends who do enjoy them, loved their drinks. The waitresses were very accommodating and didn't hesitant when we asked them to split a check multiple ways. The crowd at Olive and Twist, is on the older side- it was entertaining being the only group of 20 something's there."}
{"text":"When we're in the mood for a martini (which, alarmingly, is almost always), this is our \"go to\" place. I'm a fan of the old brick, dimly lit, speakeasy type decor, and this place has it. The food and drinks have been great every time we've stopped by. It can be tough finding a seat during the busy times ie: before and after games and shows, as the place is small, (I still haven't figured out what that top floor is for), but generally, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I don't go out downtown much but last night I grabbed my first drink at Olive or Twist. Usually I am not one for more \"upscale\" bars, I am a corner bar guy, but I have to say that I really enjoyed my time. Only planning to get 1 drink I ended up getting 3 drinks. I loved the inside of the bar and my waitress was incredibly nice and pleasant to deal with. The drinks were very good and reasonably priced. All in all I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. I enjoy the atmosphere here and their red velvet cake martini is to die for. The food, however, is a different story. I enjoyed the balsamic chicken wrap which was full of flavor, robust, and refreshing. The buffalo chicken salad, when on special and available, is the perfect portion and served on a spring mix. If you're feeling ambitious, just stick to the tried and true. I had a chicken sandwich and I got to the center for an unpleasant surprise: pink meat. Yuck! Aside from that I tried the steak salad which was a major disappointment since the meat was gristly and tough. Overall stop in for your favorite wrap and a special flavored martini, but resist the temptation to try a new dish."}
{"text":"But seriously, Olive or Twist is one of my favorite bars. Ever since I moved out of Pittsburgh, this is one of my first stops on my trips back to visit. (I am not a fan of them closing earlier though ... they were quite rude to us more than once when we came in a little before midnight. They would start to put chairs up while we were still drinking upstairs, and it was super obvious they wanted to push us out. I used to work in a restaurant, and it was a cheap restaurant, but even they did not do that. You should wait until the customer is done, end of story. That's why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. End rant).  But I have had enough good experiences that that won't detour me from going back. The appetizers are good, and I cannot get enough of the Chocolate Covered Pretzel Martini -- it's my all-time favorite."}
{"text":"I do love a good martini bar!! We ventured here not once, but twice during our stay. The first night everyone met up and I had about four martinis, all of which were delicious. My absolute favorite was the cake martini with the cookie dough martini being a close runner up. All of them were delicious. We didn't eat much, but we did chow down on the truffle fries and they were absolutely delicious.  The downstairs bar is a place to meet for 2-3 people but the upstairs bar is better for a group. The only issue I have with this place is the speed of service. We waited a while for everything. At one point, I finally got tired of waiting and went to the bar and the bartender got a bit nasty that I should really ask the cocktail server for drinks on my tab (which I had been waiting to do for 10 minutes).  All in all, a fun place to go and delicious drinks!!"}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant experience.  The food was great and our server/bartender was excellent.  We came from DC but if we ever visit Pittsburgh again we would definitely revisit Olive or twist."}
{"text":"For price alone in downtown this is a fantastic place to pickle your liver. A lot of the local inbreds hang out here, but they are an amusing bunch to watch. Some of them have 1970s suits with clashing ties and claim to be \"bankers\"..some of them wear the classic uniform of Pittsburgh, the black and gold shirt or cap of their favorite team. This is also right by several of the local theatres and Heinz Hall...so a nightcap here is a good choice. Just make sure you bee line it to the hotel @ 1am...some of the local creatures walking the street are batsh@t crazy."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that this is solely based on having a couple of drinks up at the bar. We didn't get to eat here (but would definitely return to try the food -- it all smelled delicious!)  Last night, Bobby and I found ourselves downtown to check out all of the Christmas activities, and on our way we passed Olive Or Twist. Having never been here, Bobby I asked if I would like to stop for drinks on our way out to dinner so we decided to stop in.  The first thing I noticed was how warm and inviting the atmosphere was. You could tell it was a totally fun bar, and everyone seemed to be having a great time. We somehow managed to grab a seat up at the bar and ordered off their specialty martini list.  If you're feeling festive, definitely order the cake batter martini! It was AMAZING! The chocolate rim with sprinkles was a nice touch. I also ordered a regular vodka martini, which was excellent.   The only real drawback was that the service was really slow. It took awhile to get a drink menu, and then even longer to order. The drinks came up to us separately and it took a long time to make each. Despite the wait, we would still come back. The drinks themselves were excellent and I'm now very eager to try the food!"}
{"text":"Delicious Martini's! Trendy Ambiance"}
{"text":"Had dinner here after getting a massage next door at Verve. I'm still thinking about the Smores Martini I had three days after the fact - it was yummy! I had the caprese appetizer (very good), lobster mac (good as well) and the creme brulee (totally good). The sugar crust was a teensie thick on the brulee but it was still delicious. I only wish I could sample all the martinis without getting sick the next day lol. My waiter was super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"2nd time here for dinner and Benedum show, Wicked.  Started with drinks You have to have the sweet and spicy martini.   Very nice, hot but smooth.  Next ordered entrees.  Peppered salmon on bed of arugula.   Shared bowl of tomato basil soup, excellent. Salmon was nice but alittle spicy bc of pepper but you could calm it down with mango salsa on top.  Service was great.  Atmosphere was very quiet quaint. Would definitely return and recommend Olive and twist."}
{"text":"Truly the best dining experience I've had.  Very impressed with my dinner and the whole atmosphere.    The Chef even came out to the dining area to see how everything was and share his expertise with us.    I will Definitely make this one of my regular places to dine.   Also got a tour of the upstairs banquet area and was equally impressed with it.   Perfect area for a Christmas party.    Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a good martini and dessert, I did! The music was good yet a bit loud, the staff lacked friendliness, but I did enjoy my visit. Did not go upstairs, which I imagine would be neet. People were sure flowing in."}
{"text":"Went here with 10 other girls for a bachelorette party. It wasn't overly packed for a post-Pirates game Saturday night. The restaurant is narrow, with a long bar faced by an exposed brick wall.  We sat in the back at a giant table put together for us.  Our server was mostly attentive and alcoholic drinks were refreshed relatively quickly, non-alcoholic...not so much. I don't think my water was once refilled.  I got the nachos with steak, and it was enough for a meal.  The steak was tender--like filet--much to my surprise.  I would have preferred more steak and less (to no) black olives, which were overly abundant.  Actually, the entire dish could have done with more toppings, altogether (except olives, unless that's your thing, then you're good) as the topping:chips ratio was way too little.  I didn't try anyone else's food, except for the tiramisu soaked in Kahlua.  It was very..alcoholic, and it may be too much for some.  Someone next to me ordered the buffalo chicken dip that looked like a paste served in a martini glass.  Most of it was left untouched.  Triple grilled cheese + tomato soup was enjoyed by person to my left.  I asked for a virgin cocktail (pregnant) at discretion of bartender, which was basically grapefruit juice and OJ, which was a disappointment.  Otherwise, I'd be willing to check it out again.  Keep an eye out for the Groupons, though you can't use it on alcohol, FYI."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go before a show downtown. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant in particular the upstairs space. It has a lofty, cozy feel.  Great place for drinks or and event (can rent the upstairs space).  My last visit was for a working business meeting.  Glad we made reservations for it was busy on a Friday evening. I ordered the roast beef sandwich which was very tasty and flavorful.  I love that you have a variety of options for a side and they do not charge you extra. I picked my favorite, mashed potatoes.  A colleague ordered the pesto pasta dish which looked delicious.  We didn't order drinks but in past visits they have a really nice variety of beer and I tried the Banana Bread beer (available in bottles) which is so tasty!! My only complaint was that it took a while for the waitress to take our orders and bring out the checks but it was very crowded with large parties. We stayed at our table after dinner to finish up some work and they did not mind which was great!"}
{"text":"What are your waiting for? Best calamari I've ever had, ever... drinks are on point, food is great! Can someone please get the recipe for this amazing calamari sauce?!?! There are no words!"}
{"text":"So.... This place is ok. By that I mean the drinks and the food (especially the calamari) was great. The service not so much. No acknowledgement when we arrive. Sit at the bar. None. They are not busy.   I hate to to pull the race card but this part of town lacks in diversity.   Asked to leave my card at the bar. Couple next to us didn't have to do this. I guess he thought we would run.   Never came out to see how we were doing. I had to go into the bar.   Worst service I've received in a while.   I wouldn't go if you are of flavor descent.   :)"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and appetizers while in Pittsburgh for the weekend. They have a lot of specialty martinis to choose from. I tried a few including the sparkling pomegranate and tiramisu - both really good. For appetizers, we shared the calamari and buffalo chicken dip. The calamari was served with some kind of teriyaki sauce which gave it lots of flavor - delicious. I liked how the buffalo chicken dip was served in a martini glass - it was good but nothing special.   I thought the service was good.. we sat in the dining area and had someone waiting on us the entire time. We walked by the bar on our way out - it was crowded with several groups of people standing around the bar. I'm glad we were at a table."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for an even or a quite cocktail.  They were swell to host the Yelp crew with a great drink menu and super attentive staff. I'd certainly recommend anything with the purred fruit in it (apple, any of them really)!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for dinner before the Symphony.  We both had the salmon and it was stellar.  I had it the last time I ate here and it was just as good as the first time. My friend felt the same.  Service was excellent, Laura, our server was pleasant and gave just the right amount of attention.  She came when needed, and left us to chat when not needed. No wait for the check   The cocktails were and deserts were delicious as well.  We shall definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I get it. It gets busy when you're a bartender/waitress sometimes. I've been there myself. But you can explain why things are late or why it takes nearly half an hour to pour a glass of wine without being incredibly rude and cold, and if you even say it with an apologetic smile, most customers will understand. Food was fine, won't go back for fear of the server."}
{"text":"I swung by Olive or Twist on a friend's recommendation. I was looking for some small bar bites and a brew. I went with the caprese salad which was served with Cous Cous - an interesting addition that I have personally never had before. I enjoyed it because the salad was a bit more filling with that extra shot of protein. It also provided a bit of texture that I enjoyed. The balsamic glaze was de-friggin-licious! I'd recommend venturing upstairs to hang in a big open space with a lot of comfortable seating options. Olive or Twist won't likely blow you away from a food perspective, but they will deliver on cocktails, good atmosphere, and a pretty damn good caprese salad."}
{"text":"I went to Olive or Twist before a show at the Bendedum, and while the location was perfect, the service wasn't so much. I checked in with yelp, and when I asked to redeem my free house chips courtesy of a check in, they told me they didn't have chips at all (???) however, they did manage to pull some delicious homemade chips out and serve them to us..so truthfully I was confused by the entire scenario!   We sat at the bar because they said they were booked with reservations until 8pm, so take note, they get busy (especially on show nights). Our bartenders were not overwhelmingly friendly or welcoming, and the food took forever to come out. Seriously, I was glad we were early and not rushing before the show.   I will say I ordered a pear martini which was excellent, and the steak sandwich with honey and Gorgonzola aioli was incredible. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed with the entire experience."}
{"text":"Truffle fries to die for & unique delicious cocktails w/friendly staff to boot! They could use a door curtain to keep the cold chill out as it floods the bar area every time someone enters or exits but a nice, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has a very nice lounge atmosphere. This is the place if you are into craft martinis. I highly recommend the Pittsburgh Waldorf (my new favorite). The creme sauce in the Cajun tortellini was the best I have ever tasted. It had just the right amount of spice...not too overpowering. Olive or Twist is a nice place to chill after a busy work week.  I may stop back in for a nightcap after tonight's Pirates game!"}
{"text":"I only went here to have a few drinks, and talk with a friend who wasn't sure if he wanted to eat or not. We were escorted to a table and were cool, the waitress was friendly and tentative since our conversation was rollin'. Long story short we were there for 5 hours, just drinking, and if our waitress could of re-worded her words, our experience wouldn't have been so sour. She came over and stated \"I'm leaving here is the check, if you would like to stay you're more then welcome to order from the bar.\" So we continued to talk not thinking anything of it, or someone was going to pick up her tip. WELL not two minutes later she comes back to us and says \" IM LEAVING, I need you to pay your check.\" At this point me being me, gets a little annoyed, as my friend is looking at me like no she didn't! So he paid as a gentlemen do, and we continued the night, as they dimmed the lights and shut off the music we got the hint we've been talking way to long. If she could have been a tid more polite, it would have been a good experience. The atmosphere was great, the food looked good, but your sour mouth ruined it all."}
{"text":"Fantastic martinis!!"}
{"text":"Great location before a show! Made reservation for 6:30 and was promptly seated. Took maybe 10 min for waitress to bring water so I was concerned based on how crowded it looked. But once we got ordered and started service was very good. Tried the calamari as appetizer and it was delicious. I had the Dragonberry  cocktail (pictured) and after dinner as dessert tried the Cake Batter both drinks were awesome. Dinner was steak for my husband and he said was very good and I had the Caribbean jerk sandwich and I enjoyed that - kind of spicy but I like spice so all good there. We had our check by 7:30 and just in time for our show. A great meal and service overall and would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"I went to the Art Gallery Crawl tonight and some friendly folks suggested Olive Or Twist.  They told us the drinks were a little on the pricey side, but worth it as you would only need one, so we decided to check it out.  It was fairly crowded, but not so bad considering it was a Friday night.  The waitress on the restaurant end of things suggested that we go upstairs because there were 6 of us.  We went upstairs and there was no room, so we went back down and asked her to push the tables together so we could eat and drink merrily, which she did reluctantly.  The service wasn't the best, and the food was okay, but the drinks were good.  All in all, I'd say it was a fun atmosphere.  It seemed like an older crowd.  One problem was that the performer downstairs was too loud.  I'd say for a more relaxed, visit-friendly environment head up to the lounge."}
{"text":"A decent happy hour spot that usually becomes a dinner spot, depending on how long the happy hour is! Good service, drink, and appetizers."}
{"text":"Nice location, interesting cocktail menu, but nothing is done particularly well. I still go there, but I wish the cocktails were made using fresher ingredients."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to eat, the staff is very friendly, quick and pleasant on top of having some great food. I really enjoyed the small menu they had, but with solid choices for everyone. Again, the staff was fantastic and I highly recommend this restaurant for just about any meal during your day or night in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Fun environment! Enjoyed a pumpkin ale \"pumking\" and hubs had a rusty rye. Good service! I was here 10 years ago (the last time I was in Pittsburgh), so I was happy to see this place still up and running."}
{"text":"Even if you don't get all the levels of awesome that go into the name of this place, you will certainly still be impressed by the awesome awaiting you inside.   The drinks- awesome. Very good. Creative Martini's for the Mrs.'s (or Misters, I'm not here to judge- your pomegranate martini sounds delicious) and good beers and hard stuff for the harry-er of us (or the beer-loving lady. i just can't win, can I?)  The atmosphere is also great. If you are there during an off-hour or a quiet evening it is nice and romantic, and if you are there while it's buzzing it's got a great healthy classy vibe. The exposed brick walls remind you that this is the city, and the tables, settings and amenities speak to it's elegance.   The food here is also creative, but not in that \"what the hell are you talking about\" way that some higher end places talk like. \"tonight we have an armondian sea bass which is flash lit through a denominizer...\" No. I'm talking about Buffalo Chicken dip that is served in a martini glass. You may think \"That's not a lot of dip\". You're wrong. I have never finished one. I don't understand the physics... maybe there is some kind of worm-hole or tear in the space-time continuum but the stuff is awesome and never seems to end.   Also they have THE BEST TOMATO SOUP in the city. Don't write to me telling about Grandma Edna on Polish Hill or any of that... this is the best stuff you can buy and is always available. It's so thick and rich I first thought they'd actually brought me a bowl of Vodka Sauce. Really really good Vodka Sauce.   The prices are a little higher here than I'd often like to spend on a meal and that is what kept me from giving it a full 5 stars. It isn't the place I'd go often (my wallet just wouldn't allow it) but it is a great place.  Go there. Do it."}
{"text":"My co workers and I went to Olive or Twist after work for Happy Hour. The bar area was crowded however the entire back area was open. Not one table occupied. The host said it was booked and if we didn't have reservations we had to sit at the bar. We ended up finding a table at the bar. This woman, a bartender with brown hair and boobs hanging out came over and very rudely asked \"ugh are you all on separate checks?\" We shook off that comment and told her we were waiting until 4 to order since that's when happy hour started and she said \"ok a cocktail waitress can take care of u then\" and walked away. Other than her rudeness, the martinis and food were good. The truffle fries are so yummy. I would go back but now I know to make a reservation first."}
{"text":"We came to Olive lady night to have some late night drinks. There was live music with a man playing the guitar and singing down stairs. The downstairs is pretty small but when you go upstairs, they place opens up. It turns into more of a hang out with a very chill atmosphere. The drinks were very good. They have a good selection for everyone and the wine is pretty good !"}
{"text":"If you want a SNOTTY attitude this is the place for you, with sub-par food with high prices, you have found the perfect place for a bad combination. Upon entering the door at 3:40 pm the hostess said to us (my daughter and I)\" We can seat you if you promise to leave by 6pm\", now take it there is 16-18 tables with one table occupied. I guess we promised, so she seat us at the worse table in the House, near the bathroom/kitchen and next to the fire extinguisher. When we told the waitress this table was not working, she threw our menus on the table next to us. The food was minimal in size and minimal care of preparation, my daughter order a salad with chicken, the salad came out first, then a plate of chicken came out later for the customer to put on top of salad. My salmon was bland, and asked for lemon to help the dish out, and never received the lemon.. left half the salmon uneaten.  DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT"}
{"text":"I love Olive or Twist. Absolutely love it. As I'm sure everyone who has been here has mentioned, it has a fantastic drink menu that offers a decent variety in terms of its alcoholic beverages - everything from various delicious martini-style drinks to the standard favorite beers. The place also features a really good menu; I'm very partial to its crab cake sandwich, which really hits the spot and has a perfect balance of crabcake with toppings and dressing. I especially love how any sauces or dips with appetizers are usually served in a martini glass. It's a cute and well-thought touch.  The only drawback here is that Olive or Twist is pretty darn popular; this place gets very noisy after 4:00 very quickly, especially as the happy hour prices kick in. This is even assuming you can get in - I've tried to go here on nights when it's completely booked. Completely. Every table, top and bottom floor, with only standing room near the bar.  I will continue to be a major fan because the drinks and eats really are fantastic, but will probably avoid coming here during its busiest days and hours (i.e. the end of the week and beginning of the weekend)."}
{"text":"Great food and tasty cocktails! And if you're out and about later in the evening it's a great atmosphere that's not your average loud bar. The crab cake sandwich was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good for a Friday night out. My husband and I shared a calamari appetizer that was really great. We were both a little disappointed with our main courses - tuna and salmon. Cocktails were good and strong, service was good, live music. We did not order dessert because the options were not very interesting. It's not at the top of my list to revisit, but we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here but stopped for a few martinis and was pleasantly surprised. Awesome service from Lindsey and Courtney. The perfect pear was phenomenal as well as the extensive mules available. Hand stuffed blue cheese olives!! Great atmosphere too. Wish it was closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Great martinis, AMAZING soups, and they squeezed us in on valentines even though they were totally booked solid.  Great atmosphere and fantastic live music.  I was very happy with it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch. I was a little worried because the reviews weren't so great. But we really enjoyed our meal.   He got an IPA on tap and I got the pear martini, which was really good. I love calamari but I never order it because, to me, it's just a cliche \"we're fancy here!\" appetizer and it annoys me. But, my husband wanted it so we ordered it. And it was delicious. (The sauce was da bomb.)  My husband ordered the skirt steak sandwich. It seemed so small when it came out but looks were deceiving. That was a pretty sturdy sandwich! And it was delicious. The pretzel bun and the aioli were great.   I got the pastrami reuben. I love reubens but have been disappointed so many times. Not here! It was great, and it was even too big for me to finish. I did NOT appreciate that the fruit salad I ordered as my side was on the same plate. I do not want thousand island dressing on my pineapple... But that was my only issue here.   I'm not sure I'd want to come here for dinner. But I would absolutely come here for lunch again. Especially since we didn't have room for dessert, and some of their desserts sounded amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink on new years eve . After experiecing several places for horrible service on the same day , this place was very refreshing . The bar was very crowded but the staff made sure that everyone who came in was waited on right away . Great service tops everything else ."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend on a date here. Made a reservation and it was great. Only waited a few minutes, but had some very well mixed drinks and was seated shortly after. Had a great time, food was good, wait staff was superb... Great establishment.  Only gripe I have was that there was an incredibly annoying bachelorette party in there at the same time. They sucked. But everything else was good."}
{"text":"Went here with coworkers while on a business trip to Pittsburgh. Witty name, decent prices, and interesting cocktails.  We started with their calamari, which was delicious! I wanted to lick the sauce off the plate...Also had the buffalo chicken spread which came with fried pita chips, very tasty.   For an entrée I had the filet mignon medallion, which was pretty good. The sweet potato fries were yummy. My coworker had the salmon cakes and they were very good.   For dessert we shared a warm brownie with ice cream. It hit the spot!  After dinner we moved to bar and I drank a few Pineapple Upside Down Cakes. The most delicious smelling and tasting cocktail I've had in a long time.  I would definitely recommend for appetizers and drinks!"}
{"text":"Upon our arriving in Pgurgh for a parent's 4 day getaway, and after dinner, we decided to walk over to this place. Very Very enjoyable!  It was a Thursday evening around 8 or 9.  Service was great.  And helpful to us being newbies to the establishment.  It was quite busy, but we sat at the bar, and the service was nothing but on point. There was live music, who I later obtained info from, for the restaurant we work in in downtown Johnstown.  They were a great duo!!  My fiance & I stayed for a couple of hours, and even mingled with another couple at the bar, who said we resembled Victoria & David Beckham haa.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Omg the drinks are amazing and the service is impeccable and it's St. Patty's Day. I have never been here before but I will definitely be back. I'm honestly amazing at how good everything is."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite spots. Food was always amazing.  Stopped in last night and food was not what it used to be and the bartenders were not as friendly as I remember them being.   Ordered a jerk chicken sandwich. The chicken was so dry and wasn't served with the pineapple chutney.   With all the other new spots opening downtown, they'll need to step it up to remain relevant.   That said, live music and drinks make this spot still a good time."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for one night and Olive or Twist was near our hotel.  There were many other restaurants, but this place looked nice.  The atmosphere was nice, and if I was rating only for atmosphere I'd give it 4 stars.  However, I'm mainly rating their food and service.  We were greeted promptly, but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinks/food even though there weren't many people in the dining room.    I ordered the Traditional French Dip Sandwich and Fries.  I enjoy a good French Dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst I've ever eaten. In fact, I couldn't finish it.  The meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap, glorified hot dog roll that was soggy.  It wasn't soggy from the Au Jus, but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason.    Overall, if I was going back to Pittsburgh in this area, I would stay far away from Olive or Twist."}
{"text":"Went here before seeing a show at the Benedum. Sat at the bar as there weren't open seats elsewhere. The bartenders were quick and friendly. We ordered lemon drop martinis and the Nacho appetizer.  I was happy with the drinks, although they could've been stronger for the price.  The appetizer was not the best. Chips were stale ish and the chicken was dry. Not exactly what we were looking for, but good enough. I'd give them a second chance. Or just go for drinks!"}
{"text":"I not only expect to not like Olive or Twist, I also don't really *want* to like it. My one and only issue is that its kind of expensive. Martinis are all about $10, the entrees are all around $30, and unless you're going for happy hour, all appetizers are at least $10. I always start to wonder if it's really worth the cost, but honestly, I think it is.  Every time I've gone I've shared crab cakes. Before you judge the $27 price tag, just realize that they have the type of crab cakes that are actually made with real crab. These aren't $15 crab cakes that are half bread/filling, they are proper (and very large) crab cakes. This last visit we also split nachos and lobster mac n cheese. I've heard the buffalo chicken dip is good and every dessert I've tried has been great.  It's also a martini bar so you'd expect them to be great at them, and they are. Last visit I had the chocolate covered pretzel, but other memorable martinis include the birthday cake and strawberry short cake (please don't judge- these were actually enjoyed on my birthday.) And at although these drinks aren't always my favorite type of alcoholic beverage, they are soooo good.   The place is dark (in a good way) and has impeccable service. Or at least the server I've had both times, Jeff (per our receipt) is great at his job. He's exactly the kind of sever I would always want to have: nice, polite, and overall just generally good at his job with the timing of bringing food and checking on the table.   I'd definitely visit Olive or Twist more regularly if they dropped their prices like 25%, but you get what you pay for and I'm willing to occasionally shell out the extra dough for a good meal with awesome service."}
{"text":"I've actually had OK experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad.   I tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move.  Upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding. Klassy.   For reasons I truly can't explain, we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination. We both threw down a brew nasty, paid and left. Unfortunately for Olive or Twist, the visit would probably be our last.  On a positive note, there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set. His warm-up sounded good but we left before he really got started.    When it's all said and done, we should have just went to the Sharp Edge down the street. Probably a much safer bet for future endeavors."}
{"text":"Really love the atmosphere and the specialty cocktails!! My friends and I try to make it here as much as possible!!"}
{"text":"I want to love Olive or Twist, but I just don't.  And there is really no reason for that, which is why I'm struggling to write this review.  I thought my server was really nice and informative.  We walked right in and had a table on a Wednesday night, no problems.  (It is sort of small so I assume for the dinner hour you should make a reservation.)  I've eaten here twice and had the Penne Alla Vodka both times and enjoyed it.  The fried calamari is great and the drink menu seems to be pretty large.  There's just something that seems off and keeps me from labeling it a must-see destination.  There's a bit of a chain restaurant feel with the menu or that it can't decide if it's an Italian restaurant or a sandwich place.  Maybe that's the point and I'm missing it.  Either way, I would definitely advise trying it out for yourself.  I don't think you'd be disappointed.  I went here the first time before a show at Heinz Hall and I thought it was absolutely perfect for that."}
{"text":"If you like trying new amazing drinks you need to come here to try their dessert drinks. I love girly drinks, I do not enjoy beer. Their chocolate margaritas and birthday cake margaritas are amazing. I've had their chocolate covered pretzel and strawberry cheesecake as well and those are fantastic"}
{"text":"Well that was an odd night.  Came in after a Steelers game (5pm) and the staff seemed genuinely surprised that people had come to a restaurant to eat.  The place was pretty empty, but that didn't stop them from taking 15 minutes to come ask for for a drink order.  And well over 45 for food to arrive.   Long enough that we had to ask where our food is and were informed by the (single) server \"I'm sure it's fine.\"  Well, the Cajun tortellini was more like the stuff from giant eagle with some hillshire farm sausage.     Ummm.    Anyway, the martinis were good.  Once they showed up."}
{"text":"My friends and I were traveling through Pittsburgh and needed some dinner. We found this place by accident and I'm so happy we did! The food was really good, yet not insanely expensive. The bartender was so chill and gave us great suggestions for stuff to do in Philly (our next stop). She told us where to go and some really great places to hit up! It was nice to see she actually cared and we had a great conversation! The drinks were also very very good!!! Definitely will return next time I'm in Pittsburgh this summer."}
{"text":"Was here last night, food was ok. Portions were small. The only think making this a 3 star review was the service. Our server was very attentive even though they were busy! We all had steak salads our dressings got messed up when delivered and happy hour beers were still 4 or more dollars for domestic drafts. Overall an ok experience."}
{"text":"Went here during happy hour on a Thursday. Nothing special. Had beer and an appetizer (buffalo chicken dip) the dip tasted fine but was cold in the middle. I wasn't going to ask them to take it back and reheat it.  The REAL PROBLEM was with the bill. I had a credit card transaction for my bill amount on 6-15-17 THEN I had another charge for the same amount 6 days later. I was only in Pittsburgh the one night. I don't know if they are a shady company or if this was some kind of error. I just know that choosing to eat there cost me several hours of my time sorting out the issue by calling my company support, American express, and the restaurant. Geez. BTW. When you call them no one answers. It doesn't matter what \"extension\" that you choose.  Wont be back when I come back to the burgh."}
{"text":"Follow the logo and go for the martinis. I had the s'mores martini and it had to be one of the best things I had ever tasted. Service is also prompt and friendly. The three stars is because the price is steep and the taste doesn't really correlate. I also didn't like the fact that calamari is listed on the happy hour menu in the menu but isn't actually at happy hour pricing... a general point of disappointment but one none the less. I had the Cajun tortellini, it was decent and the portion was pretty solid but it did not meet $20 expectations, I would say the same of the lobster Mac and Cheese though this is the dish I would repeat if pressed. calamari was also okay, not bad, not great. I would come back for a nice drink in a good atmosphere, particularly during happy hour, but you can rest assured I will eat before I come."}
{"text":"Not the most happening place for young adults, but good service and good drinks. May stop back again."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Olive or Twist.  We came over this past summer for food and cocktails, but this last visit was just for the booze to have a celebratory drink with Laura M on her Birthday after seeing a great Ballet at the Benedum.   I don't mind O&T layout.  It's a bit chopped up but very Pittsburghese reminiscent of most establishments.  There is the upstairs where you can sit by the roaring fire on the 72\" flat screen or lounge on many of the couches or loveseats they have available.  There is also the downstairs that seems to have similar offerings, however at least in our experiences was a lot busier than upstairs.  I pick less busy almost every time. This time around we found three bar seats available upstairs and settled down for a couple drinks.   I started with a Southern Tier XXX IPA, solid start to the evening.  I know they specialize in Martinis but I specialize in craft beer.  After that I decided to try a martini, I went with an Espresso Manhattan Martini.  This was defreakinlishious... I love coffee and I love manhattans so the two went together like peas and carrots.  Our service was mixed.  Some bartenders seemed more helpful and interested in waiting on us than others.  This was also my experience from last time.  This time we didn't order food though we were pretty hungry and went elsewhere to eat.  Our last meal here was not worth duplicating.  We both had an Olive or Twist Burger, and I chose sweet potato fries and requested a med rare cook.  We used the Yelp deal so it wasn't as expensive as it could have been, but the burger sells for $13.00.  I rarely complain about cost especially if it is good, however it really was not.  The meat was way overcooked and dry.  Surprisingly the fries were the best thing on the plate.  To spend that on a burger I do expect a better quality.  So lesson learned, we had some tasty drinks here last weekend, but ate at a neighboring facility afterwards.  I'm sure we will be back for drinks again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself flying solo per the usual, I stopped in after work shortly after 10pm the bar was lively and had a great vibe everyone looked like they were there to have a good time. There were no shaders to be found.   I was served my drink and had my food order placed , in less then 5 minutes even though it was crowded.  Nothing takes the fun out of a bar experience more than having to wait an exuberant amount of time to get your drink, which was not the case for Olive Or Twist, even on a Friday night with easily 50 people in the bar.  My bartender Linda was no-nonsense when my glass was empty she was quick with another.   I had the caprese salad and tomato basil soup.  The caprese was just fine by me. , The mozzarella was sliced thick, for a caprese it was a very hearty portion.    Now for the soup it was thick and creamy but wasn't warm what so ever!!! Granted it was after 10pm but I would have liked it be served a little warmer.   I saw some pretty amazing and tasty martini's being prepared. Olive Or Twist has a martini that is served with sprinkles rimming the glass I think I overheard that it was called the cake batter martini, fun and impressive!"}
{"text":"I treated my sister to drinks at Olive or Twist for her birthday, since she's a big martini fan. It was Monday night and the place was maybe half full, so we came in and were immediately seated. The atmosphere was urban-chic and pretty dimly lit. Definitely a nice space for a cocktail bar. Our server was friendly and attentive, if a little slow at times. The special was \"Wine Down Mondays\" (certain wines $5/glass all night) and he tried to argue with me and say it was only during happy hour. I directed him to the advertisement on our table saying otherwise, and he was very kind about the misunderstanding. We wound up going with several glasses of the cabernet on special as well as two appetizers and two martinis to wash it all down with. Everything was delicious. The calamari was a little cloyingly sweet for me (I would have strongly preferred more crunch and spice) but the rare ahi tuna app was savory with an interesting texture and very much to my liking! I was able to use a recently purchased Yelp voucher for $20, which pretty much covered the cost of our food. The server was very accommodating with that, which was appreciated. I hate when restaurants fight tooth and nail to prevent you from using a discount. Overall I can certainly see myself coming back here again. It's definitely a special occasion place (I'm more of a beer and whiskey in a dive bar person at heart) but I honestly loved getting more dressed up and drinking fancy-ish cocktails for a few hours. It was a nice change of pace!"}
{"text":"I have no reason to give this place less than 5 stars!  I've been here before a few times, but this past Friday we had birthday reservations for my girlfriend's 25th at 8pm.  I got there and the place was almost empty! Quite a change from other times I've been in.  I didn't mind it though, we had a great dinner and were able to hear each other speak.  We started with the calamari.  It was fried and tossed in a sweet, Asian flavored sauce.  It was amazing!  Cooked well and not your typical breading.  I ordered their red pepper and gouda soup and the steak salad with chicken instead.  Chicken was tender and cooked well.  It had a lot of flavor and the ranch was excellent.  Others at the table had the steak sandwich, grilled cheese and soup, and steak salad.  All received rave reviews.  The real reason to come here, though, is for their martinis!  I haven't had a drink here I didn't like.  This past weekend I had the strawberry shortcake martini (long week!) and it tasted like a milkshake.  It was frothy and the rim of the glass had a brown sugar (?) crushed graham cracker.  Other drinks I've tried here range from cosmo's to caramel apple and other martinis (OMG.), the grapefruit mimosa-type drink, riesling and vodka diet cokes.  Everything has been well-executed, not watered down and served promptly.  It is clean inside and has a swanky, open upstairs with couches, high tops, televisions and a large bar.  A really fun and different place to go either for food or just drinks or both!"}
{"text":"This place is fortunate enough to have a great location near the theatre and restaurant scene, but outside of that - it's pretty \"blah\" in my opinion.  Possibly worthy of a stop for a drink before or after dinner or a show, I wouldn't make it a destination-type experience.   Olive or Twist is good for a cocktail, a convenient location, and a clever name, but not much else."}
{"text":"This is a gret place to go if you like Martini's!  The food is pretty good and the decor is awesome!  There are always some randoms bartending and you're never sure if you'll get a hipster or old mother Hubbard, but they always serve great drinks!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to grab some apps and drinks before a show downtown. Love the atmosphere here! Very chic and urban. We had two of their specialty cocktails (both were great!), the fried calamari and their version of a caprese salad. Food was really great - calamari came out hot and crispy with a spicy dipping sauce and the caprese salad was very fresh with a drizzle of balsamic and a fregula/couscous salad underneath tossed in the the same dressing. Very good! I would like to come back here to check out some more of their menu."}
{"text":"Surprisingly really good food here! We had a groupon to use for the night and came in on a Friday afternoon during happy hour... Apparently that is when they are busiest. The buffalo chicken dip with pita chips was really good, and you really can't beat half priced during happy hour (there were 3 to choose from for half off)! I think they must deep fry the pita chips, otherwise I don't know how else they get to be so good... Although the dip could definitely use more chicken. We took the leftover cream cheese home and added a can of white chicken breast meat to make it better.   We tried the seared ahi tuna, Jamaican jerk chicken burger and the Maui wow and creme brûlée for dessert. Theirs has got to be the best creme brûlée I've had in a really long time. It's got a nice thin crisp bruleed crust and you really taste the vanilla bean inside. The Maui wow was great too! It had real coconut and pineapple bits and had a light and fluffy consistency. The seared tuna tasted really fresh and was plated beautifully. Hubby liked his jerk burger, along with the generous helping of sweet potato fries it came with. Also, they use  pretty good bread in their sandwiches...   The only real drawback was how packed and disorganized it appeared to be. Because it was our first time, we were really confused as to whether we were supposed to seat ourselves or not, and where to sit. It also smells like cigarettes, because lots of people smoke outside and come in and out constantly. However, our waitress was really great and she never had to write down any of our orders but still got everything just right.   Worth it, and plan on coming back! :]"}
{"text":"If you see my previous review of Olive or Twist, it was less than glowing. I was surprised when Brandon, the G.M. reached out to me concerning my bad experience. We exchanged a few emails and he apologized for our bad experience, took responsibility for it, and offered a gift card if i wished it, to give them another try. I accepted his gracious offer, and a gift card showed up in my mailbox a few days later.     While my wife and i enjoy eating out often (5-6 times a month or more), we don't dine in downtown Pittsburgh too often. We live almost an hours drive away, plus there are the parking issues. So , although i received the card last March, i didn't use it until Yesterday 3/12.     I bought my wife a 3 ballet subscription package for a Christmas gift. The first one was in February. I immediately thought of going to Olive or Twist for dinner prior to the show. I called and of course since it was the day before amateur night(Valentines day), there was no table available.     This month, i was able to get a table at our desired time. We got there a little early, and were seated immediately. Our server took our drink orders promptly. The martinis are expensive, but so are most martinis at most places. Hell, even a glass of draft beer is $6+ in a lot of places. Can't fault a business for charging what the traffic will bear.      We ordered our entrees while enjoying our drinks and conversation. The place can be a bit loud, but not so much to prevent conversation. We have been to places where they have (so called) entertainment that eliminates any chance of having a conversation while dining. Even a single singer with a guitar feels the need to crank up the amp so that no one can talk. This was common at Siba on 228 by Cranberry. Hmm, they went out of business, didn't they?    Anyway, none of that at Olive or Twist, at least on the first floor. Our entrees arrived quickly, within 10-15 minutes  of us ordering them. My wife once again ordered the crab cake sandwich, which is mostly crab with a little breading. I guess at $17 you can say it's a bit pricey for a sandwich, but crab is not cheap, and you get a LOT of crab. It came with a house salad that my iceberg hating wife raved about. The only thing she didn't care for was that it came with Srircha ailoi. She does not like sriracha(i know, i love her anyway). She asked for it on the side to at least try it, but did not like it. Our server happily replaced it with some mayo at her request. I ordered off the special board, a Reuben sandwich. It was one of the best reubens i have had in a long time. Perfect ratio of corned beef to kraut to bread, very little dressing, and the corned beef was lean lean lean and lean! Delicious!     We chatted with our server a bit and told him of our previous visit and about Brandon reaching out to me. 5 minutes later Brandon stopped at our table, introduced himself, and thanked us for giving them another try. I in turn thanked him for the gift card and for his professional response to my less than stellar previous review. The way that Brandon handled that situation should be taught to everyone involved in running a restaurant. I can compare it to something that happened to me at a different restaurant. My wife and I used to LOVE The Brick house in Butler. Their food was always flavorful, interesting, and well prepared. Prices were reasonable, and service was usually good. It became our favorite restaurant, and over the course of several years we ate there often, took our grown sons and their families there, recommended it to many of our friends, and literally spent more there than any other restaurant we had ever eaten at.      One Saturday evening, we went to The Brick house for dinner. I will make a long story short(yea, i know too late). The food was awful. Horrible. My wifes dinner was almost inedible. My dinner was a little below average, but edible, so i ate it. The owner refused to speak to us, so we left, went home, and wrote a review    So what was his reaction to my review? He insisted the food was fine, called me boarish, insisted i was a freeloader that was just looking for a free meal, and that i was just an overall jerk of a customer.     My point in relating this story is this.The result of Larry G of the brick houses handling of the negative feedback is a customer lost forever, who is happy to share his experience with others. The result of Brandon's handling is a happy customer who will return to spend more money, and to share his positive experience with others.     Overall, there is a lot to like about Olive or Twist, and nothing of consequence to dislike. We will be back, and recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Updating my review because I visited again and was really pleased with the entire experience. My mom and I visited on a Friday night; it was crowded downstairs so we headed up to the second floor. we visited in December and the the decorations were gorgeous. There was even a giant fire crackling on the tv. It was happy hour, my mom ordered the chocolate pretzel martini and I ordered a glass of Chardonnay. My mom lovedd her martini- it was really tasty. To start off, we got the caprese appetizer. When I first saw it, I thought that it looked really small and wasn't  impressed... But when I tasted it I completely changed my mind. It was awesome- easily the best caprese I have ever had at a restaurant. The mozzarella was fresh, as were the tomatoes and basil. The balsamic was delicious too. It wasn't large, yes, but it was incredibly tasty. For our main dishes, I had the chipotle wrap with bacon, turkey and other goodies with a side of fresh fruit and my mom had the chicken sandwich with snap peas. We both loved our sandwiches. Mine was spicy but not overwhelming and just packed with fresh and delicious flavors. The fruit was fresh too and super tasty. My mom loved her sandwich and her snap peas were cooked and seasoned perfectly. To top it all off our server was incredibly attentive to our table and very friendly. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Only rating the upstairs friday happy hour. It had a nice lounge like feel with a lot of females. Not sure if it's always like this. The bar was trying to get rid of their excess green beer from St Pattys for just $1, so we had a couple. All in all a good chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Go for the martinis, don't stick around for the food.   I have been here several times for tiny tini Tuesdays - a weekly event that allows you to sample their colorful and delicious martini's in tiny glasses.  You order three at a time for a somewhat steep $12.  If you want variety though, this is not to be underestimated.    However, the food is always lacking.  I went on a lunch date here and decided to go for the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup as my stomach wasn't feeling up to anything more adventurous.  The grilled cheese was fine.  Nothing special.  The soup however had a thin drizzle of basil oil which when stirred in made the soup greasy and wholly unappetizing.    Your best bet is to head there after work for the martinis and then head around the corner to Six Penn for food."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch. My wife order a wrap and I order a salad. Very nice food. The sweet potato fries are wonderful. My smoked duck break salad is wonderful too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Whether you want to get loopy with their \"Loopy\" martini or chill out with a classic IPA, this place is a must visit.  I always assumed Olive or Twist was just another chain that wasn't anything special. Toootally my bad. With the exposed bring and dim but not too dim lighting, the atmosphere in this place is chill complete with unique light fixtures and the exposed brick wall. I loved it. I am a lucky North Sider who could easily find myself not stuck parking in the garage, but walking. Park a street over on the street if you are lucky. The parking is the only downfall.  I went here for a date with my boy, followed by drinks with friends, so we really got the whole experience. I thought it'd be dressy since it's located downtown. It was pretty casual dress. Thank goodness because designers don't dress up for work!   Try out the martinis, if you are that type. Even the guys had a grand time trying unique flavors! A must try.  Oh yes, and the Seared Tuna Salad is a muuuust. If you aren't feeling the salad, try out the seared tuna app. I was impressed."}
{"text":"We came downtown on a Sunday afternon before a show looking for cocktails, seemingly this was the only place open on a Sunday. Olive of Twist is very dark, but it makes for a nice date spot. They found a way to make exposed brick walls and large indsutrial fans classy.  Their cocktails are absolutely great, at the top of the list is a proper gin martini with an olive or twist. They may also make the best sidecars in Pittsburgh, but for $8 - $10 a drink you should expect as much.  The calmari was excellent and we'll keep them in mind for their extensive dessert menu."}
{"text":"I stopped by Olive or Twist for a couple of drinks with my friend and fellow Yelper Carrie W. after seeing The Nutcracker at the Benedum last Fri.  When Carrie suggested that we grab some drinks, I suggested that we go to Olive or Twist because I'd been wanting to check it out for awhile. I rarely receive the opportunity to go out for drinks after shows because some of my friends who I attend shows with tire out early (lame) or don't really go to bars ever (even lamer), so I was excited to finally have the opportunity to imbibe a few in a classy setting downtown.  Given that it was my birthday, I knew exactly what I wanted drink-wise, thanks to Rachel C.'s review: the cake batter martini!  Thanks to other reviews, I was aware that O or T's specialty martinis are dessert-y drinks rather than your typical martini.  This was absolutely fine by me, since I enjoy sweeter digestifs later at night.  As can be seen from my photo, this martini comes with a rim of chocolate syrup spangled with multicolored decorative sprinkles, which made for a very festive--and delicious--birthday drink.  Once I finished it, I went for a second round and chose the mint chocolate martini, which also came adorned with chocolate syrup.  It tasted exactly like melted mint ice cream--my favorite kind.  Yum!  We sat at the upstairs side bar, and service from the bartenders was generally good--one of them even wished me happy birthday when I mentioned why I was ordering the cake batter martini.  While it was busy, it wasn't so crowded as to feel claustrophobic.  The noise level was a bit on the loud side--but then again, what bar isn't?  I really enjoyed my visit to O or T, and look forward to returning again, once I can convince my friends to stop by for a drink.  I'd love to check out the happy hour, in particular.  Because I haven't tried the regular (non-specialty) drinks or the food, I'm going with a 4, but I'll update my review once I return and do so."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place before the Billy Joel concert and we had a wonderful meal/time. We made a reservation, which I would definitely recommend if you are going before an event.  The atmosphere here is very cool. Exposed brick walls and high ceilings make it feel much like a small bar/restaurant you would find randomly in Brooklyn or the village.  First things first, drinks! I ordered the classic olive or twist with deaths door gin and it was wonderful! My mother ordered the strawberry shortcake martini which tasted like a melted strawberry cheesecake blizzard from dairy queen that melted in a glass with vodka (very tasty but too sugary for me). The others ordered non martini drinks (Vodka tonic and a moscow mule) that came out just fine. If you come during happy hour the prices aren't too bad at all!!  Continuing with the happy hour theme we ordered the half priced nachos, one with steak and one with chicken. The four of us devoured them while waiting for our meal. The nachos are very good and done very well but if there are more than 3 of you at a table and your hungry order 2! However, one is more than enough for 2.  Entrees then came to the table and I had the Roasted Turkey Cobb salad which was also done well and the turkey was a nice change to the Cobb salads usual chicken. The turkey tasted just like thanksgiving! Other entrees ordered were the crab cakes (which were very generously sized), the crab cake sandwich with sweet potato fries (The fries are amazing!), and the short ribs and regular fries (which I would pass on TBH). Other than the regular fries everything else was thoroughly enjoyed.  Finally, after many drinks we decided would could all split a desert. My father was the only smart one who decided he didn't want to share, but ended up with the saddest looking desert I have ever seen. He ordered a vanilla bean cake dish that he said was good, but the presentation was very underwhelming. The rest of us ordered the baked appletini desert with vanilla ice cream. It was like a deconstructed apple pie ala mode served in a martini glass. Between the three of us I am surprised we didn't break the glass or stab each other trying to get a bite!   Overall, I would totally recommend this to friends looking for a good meal or for a decent happy hour spot!!!"}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken dip alone keeps me coming back! The food and drinks are a little pricy, but are well worth it. They unique drinks and appetizers that one can make a meal out of alone. The food can be hit or miss on the menu, my wife did not like her pasta, but I very much enjoyed my pork chop. It was cooked to perfection! I would definitely get a reservation, especially on nights that entertainment events are happening downtown. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"The genius of the \"Olive or Twist\" name got us in the door here, but we didn't have the best experience with their mixers.  While here, we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini.  The blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum. As a strong drink, it was good. However, the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink. For the cucumber basil martini, the basil is the primary flavor in the drink and kills any undertones of the cucumber. The sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing.  In addition to a cocktail menu, they also offer a reasonable selection of beers including microbrews."}
{"text":"We had our 20-year high school reunion at Olive or Twist and it was the perfect venue!  The upstairs space was ideal to provide a fun bar atmosphere that we could have all to ourselves.  The food was delicious and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed for a successful evening.  Their event manager, Brandon Thompson, took care of every detail and worked with us to make sure we stayed within our budget.  No one wants to be in charge of planning their high school reunion, but I would absolutely do it again if I could do it at Olive or Twist and work with Brandon and his team.  Everything was awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here before a show at the Cabaret with a friend for happy hour : ) We had a $10 for $20 coupon, but didn't end up using it since the specials were enough for us (didn't want to get too stuffed before going to see a show)!  We each started off with martinis - since they have sooo many delicious sounding drinks, woman behind the bar was happy to recommend and help us decide. The ones we decided on, Espresso (for a nice kick before the show) and orange creamsicle martinis were great - and $2 off each for happy hour! For food, we went with nachos and the buffalo dip - dip was cute and served in a martini glass with tasty pita chips, and the nachos were decent, even if a little skimpy on the toppings (but I could just be overdemanding when it comes to nachos).   All in all, very pleasant experience right before going to the cabaret. Would love to go back sometime to try more of their drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! The atmosphere is great and the martini list is extensive. I've ordered the cake batter, caramel apple, and s'mores and haven't been disappointed in any so far. The buffalo chicken dip appetizer is what keeps us coming back! It is served cold in a martini glass with warm pita chips and is just amazing! I've ordered several dishes and haven't had a bad meal either!  The only thing that lacks sometimes is the service, especially on my last visit. We were standing at the hostess stand for a couple of minutes and no one came over. Finally a girl did but she just looked at us, got something, and walked away. Not even a \"someone will be right with you\". Then another girl came over and said \"do you need a table?\". I wanted to respond with \"why would I be standing at a podium that says let us seat you\", but I refrained. We were seated, it took several more minutes for our drink order to be taken and it was subpar service the rest of the night. Waiting, waiting, and more waiting.   Other than that, love the food, love the atmosphere and especially love the martinis!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop by Olive or Twist on a recent Saturday night before a show. A friend was at a wedding upstairs and asked us to drop in to say hi. Apparently they host wedding receptions in the lounge area above the bar/restaurant.  I was hoping to get a quick meal and a drink before the show. When we arrived the bar was packed and we were told that they had no availability to sit in the restaurant section. But, little can deter me. I scoped out the tables by the bar and noticed a couple getting ready to pay. After making casual chit chat, they agreed to save their table for us. They paid and left while we ordered a drink at the bar. As soon as they got up the waitress put a reserved sign on the table, I assumed it was for us and sat down. Nope. She was trying to reserve it for an 8pm reservation. I thought this was the bar area which is seat yourself? Oh well, I told her we had to be out by 8 for a show anyway so it would work out fine. A few minutes later she came back and told us no, that won't work and we will have to find a place at the bar. Seriously? We are already sitting in the seat yourself tables, it was fine 2 minutes ago, we have to leave by 8, what's the issue? Rather annoyed we looked for seats and ways to inch ourselves into the already overly crowded bar when the waitress returned and said she will reserve another table that was leaving. Now, we have wasted 10 minutes of our already limited time before the show so, I asked what was the fastest thing on the menu. We ordered soup, salad and the buffalo chicken spread. The soup arrived first. I had the homemade chicken noodle. Warm, comfort food that hit the spot. Next was the pear salad with candied walnuts, blue cheese and strawberry vinagerette.  Again, super tasty. I could snack on the candied walnuts all day. Then the buffalo chicken spread. Presentation was great-in a martini glass. The pita chips were delic! But where was the chicken? I searched through the entire martini glass, not one shred or chunk of chicken. Being a buffalo chicken dip lover, I was sorely disappointed. As for the drinks, stick with the martinis as the wine was also a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent food (especially the tomato basil soup- and I don't even like tomato soup).  Moderate service, nice atmosphere, though sometimes a bit too loud for conversation."}
{"text":"We came here to use the $10 for $20 deal. The server, Alex, was very nice and friendly. Our food kind of took a long time to come out, especially considering the fact that it was a salad and a turkey wrap. However, the food items were very tasty; my salad was really good - it was the candied walnut one, can't go wrong with those on it. The drink menu didn't seem to have prices for the martinis on it but we assumed they would be expensive so didn't get one, but if I come back it will be for a martini."}
{"text":"Nice service! But I still feel screwed. I use the \"deal\" so even though I was there for \"happy hours \" I could not get that deal because I used the deal with yelp. What that's not right! They got ya one way or another GRrr"}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception here this weekend & it couldn't have gone any better! Thank you so much to Brandon and the event staff for making our wedding go so smoothly! I had multiple people say it was one of the best weddings they had been to, and that \"all weddings should be like this.\" The cocktail-style reception allowed for a relaxed, party atmosphere, but there were plenty of seats and table-tops for our 100 guests. Brandon was also quick to respond to all of my emails and was incredibly knowledgeable & dead-on with his estimations as far as cost and the right amount of food for our guests. Thank you again, our wedding was perfect! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago around 4 or 5 on Saturday before a game. It's a martini bar, but they can't make a cucumber martini? Also, worst lobster mac n cheese I've had in my life and I've had some bad ones. No discernible pieces of lobster and it tasted like bacon bits with a cup of salt dumped on top. I took a bite and asked for my bill. Might be good for a cheap beer before the game, but there are much better options for good food and booze in the area."}
{"text":"Visiting, found on yelp and a quasi recommend.  The Fri nite vibe was great.  Live guitarist, excellent.  Steak sandwich and salad was very good. 2x IPA Strongbow made my palate complete.  Bartenders attentive too..Well done."}
{"text":"Great time. Went over for drinks after James Taylor concert. Bar had a fun crowd"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! My wife and I got married here. We needed a nice venue near our hotel to do the wedding and the reception -- and Olive Or Twist delivered. They served good food and great drinks.   Brandon Thompson, their Director of Sales & Events, was so  helpful and helped make the evening a joy.   If you're going to be in Pittsburgh, stop by this fine establishment. You'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Olive or Twist is the historic site of my VERY FIRST MARTINI when I turned 21, many years ago.    It's been a long, happy union.  While Olive or Twist is NOT a five star restaurant, it gets 5 stars from me because I love it.  Its one of the few places I know of that has been CONSISTANTLY good.  for years!  The interior is warm and a little bit industrial.  The downstairs is the same as it has always been and it's still very nice.  The drinks are great although the first martini I ever had (a girl doesn't forget!  [well,this one didn't]) was a Pineapple Upside Down martini and I don't think they offer that anymore but they do have a very expansive martini menu.  I tried the chipotle martini and it was so excellent that when I took my first sip I sighed in a way my bf turned to me and sarcastically said, \"Oh, you're going to be Yelping about that, aren't you?\"  Then, I refused to let him even try it bc it was that good.  It was MINE.  I also had a cake batter martini which tasted great and came out looking so pretty I instagrammed a picture of it and immediately all my friends clicked like on it, and my one aunt commented I should drink less.  Whatever. She needs a martini.  The service was great.  Our waitress, Lauren, was really cool and very good at recommending the drinks--the chipotle martini was her recommendation, I would never had ordered that on my own.  We had the buffalo chicken dip which was served in a martini glass and it was really good.  My favorite thing on the menu there is the tomato basil bisque soup and it has been rocking my lunch hour for the past ten years.  It's delicious.  Its so good that Lauren and I actually high fived when she brought it out.  (true story.)  My bf had the chicken caprese wrap and said it was excellent, it was gone within minutes so that is a good sign.  I highly recommend this place for lunch, after dinner cocktails, or a date.  This is one of my favorite downtown lunch spots!"}
{"text":"I have been here few times over the years but never ate here.  It's a great happy hour spot - have a drink or two around friends. The lower level could be bit crowded during happy hour but they have an upstairs where you can lounge or sit at the bar.  Overall, a fun atmosphere - pretty diverse crowd."}
{"text":"Came here before a Steelers game to pre-game with some food and vino. We asked the server about the house Malbec and house Pino Noir. She said she didn't know as they were listed on the menu as simply 'Malbec' and 'Pinot Noir'. Respectively, we ordered both thinking they couldn't be very bad and we added truffle fries for good measure.   The service was good, even though our server had a lot of tables to cover. The wine was TERRIBLE. Order beer instead and if you aren't into beer, skip this place all together. The truffle fries did not taste the least bit like truffles, but were crispy and delicious (I could have done without the sprinkling of NFG, non functional garnish, in the form of parmesan cheese)."}
{"text":"I made it into Olive or Twist a few weeks ago to celebrate surviving my first week of graduate school!  My friend told me to pick wherever I wanted for a celebratory dinner, and Yelp brought me here.  The name was catchy, and the food looked cool.  And martinis are my drink of choice.  What's not to love?  We made reservations, but the bar upstairs was cooler so we went upstairs instead.  There are bar tables and couches and comfy chairs to hang out on.  The service was amazing, and we never wanted for anything.  Every need was met before we could even ask.  I started out with the Orange Dreamsicle martini, and while it was on the sweet side, it was delicious!  If I return, I will definitely get another one of these.  Not strong alcohol wise but yummy.  We ordered the scallops and Asian fusion calamari for appetizers.  My friend was super upset with the scallops and thought they tasted bad.  I don't really know anything about scallops so I ate them.  He complained to the manager, and the manager was nice enough to take 1/2 off, which I thought was really nice considering it wasn't stopping me from eating them.  (#PoorKidProblems).  The calamari was really unique but delicious.  The actual calamari was good, but it was covered in some sauce similar to stir fry sauce.  It was good, and the portion was a really fair size for the price.  I then moved onto the Key Lime Pie martini.  It was a let down after the Dreamsicle, but there was nothing wrong with it.  I personally preferred the first one.  My favorite food item was my entree.  I ordered the Penne ala Vodka, and when she put it on the table, I thought I had gone to garlic heaven.  Simple but wonderful.  There was also a very generous amount of asiago cheese on top of my pasta and a slice of prosciutto.  I took about half of the portion home, but I finished it off that night because it was so delicious.  I really loved this place, and on a Friday night, it was EMPTY.  I don't know if this was because of Labor Day weekend or a Pirates game, but we were the only people in the bar area by 8:00.  Hopefully it was just a fluke because I liked Olive or Twist!"}
{"text":"Went to their NYE event two other years, 2015 and 2014 and it was MUCH better than 2017. Not prepared (food not ready, balloon drop not done accurately, music not working) and very poor set up. The speakers almost falling down on guests due to those too drunk and holding on to it for support. Next year I won't be going upstairs for this event. However on the downstairs seemed much nicer. Will be back for dinner as I've always liked dinner and drinks there. Bar staff was all who seemed prepared."}
{"text":"This is a nice trendy spot downtown. The kitchen defiantly knows what's going on. Smaller portion sizes still pack the flavor! Last time I had the salmon and this time I had the crab cake sandwich, both were excellent. The ahi tuna appetizer was small but again it was excellent. We were not impressed with the salted pretzel martini and it was a little too sweet - but the food ensured the high review! Great job to the chef and kitchen crew!"}
{"text":"Such a nice chill bar. Anytime my friends and I just want to have a few drinks this is always our first stop. The music and atmosphere is always great every time we go and they sometimes have live music too! They have a great drink menu and good food. I've had the braised short rib and it was melt in your mouth and to die for!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Stiff martinis and cocktails, cheap drinks, good service, nice atmosphere to chill in the upstairs lounge and hang up with your friends. Classy crowd and much more mature, older, and professional crowd. There aren't any of those college frat boys or belligerent drunks there, which is so great. Very nice place to wind down after a long day."}
{"text":"When your favorite drink always involves vodka, then this is your place.  They have the best selection of martini's in the Burgh.  Whether you love them sweet, dirty, or like a dessert in a glass, you'll find a favorite.  My biggest problem is that I've found one too many favorties.  While the martini's are delish, I'm not as big a fan of the food.  The buffalo chicken spread appetizer is great for happy hour but I just didn't love the other items I've tried and the entrees aren't memorable.  I recently discovered the upstairs lounge and it was comfortable and spacious (much more so than the crowded downstairs bar).   If you work downtown and you haven't stopped here for happy hour, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"It's everything a great cocktail bar should be.  Great location, ambiance, cocktails and chill environment.  **Disclaimer:   5 stars doesn't have to mean it's New York City good. It is a simple place and it's not flashy by any means.   I'd take a girl for the beginning of a date or on the opposite end of the spectrum, talking business with colleagues."}
{"text":"This bar is cramped, overpriced, and the service is unbelievably slow. Happy Hour runs 4-6, so you'll show up at 5, have no place to sit or stand, and will only be able to get *maybe* 2 drinks during happy hours You'll then be told that the upstairs (which is actually not bad) will be opening at 5, even though you're asking at 5:20 (this has seriously happened all three times I've been there).  Seriously, avoid this place. When one of your co-workers suggests a work happy hour, direct them anywhere else."}
{"text":"Called in November to secure the upstairs for our wedding after party and were instructed that they do not accept reservations over a month prior to the event.  We were told to call back a month prior which we did only to learn that upstairs had been booked by another party.  Upon speaking to Brandon we learned they do in fact accept reservations over a month out.  So either the person we spoke with on the phone was misinformed or said that to get us off the phone.  In any case when learning this Brandon simply stated that we were wrong repeatedly and offered no alternative.  I wasn't expecting them to cancel the other party to accommodate our party.  However when I asked what he do to accommodate us he was unapologetic and rude.  The customer service displayed was some of the worst I have ever seen.  Luckily an establishment in the area heard our issue and was SYMPATHETIC and worked with us to resolve our issue.  I will never set foot in that place again or spend a single cent there ever."}
{"text":"Always a good spot if you are craving a martini. As per the waitress recommendation, I ordered a pear martini and my husband had a Moscow mule. Both were delicious without being sweet.   Some might find the dinner selection limited but I think it allows for the restaurant to highlight some great dishes. My husband had the Tuscan steak sandwich and he could not stop raving about it. He loved the pretzel roll that it was served on. I went a little more traditional and ordered a burger but it was a perfectly cooked burger.   This is not our first time stopping at Olive or twist and it will not be our last!"}
{"text":"We came here for drinks on a Friday night. They had a few good scotchs to select from and the upstairs had a nice crowd which wasn't too packed. Everyone cleared out by about 12:30 am."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of \"are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else\"  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it. We started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toasted/fried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.   The problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.  It may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs, but being at the high top bar tables, we had no room for our drinks, appetizer and meal.  We found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything.  It was frustrating.  Not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees.   With as much as we enjoyed the appetizer, we were looking forward to our meals. Unfortunately, they were very disappointing.  My friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  Her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm.  When she mentioned it to the server, the server said \"so would you like me to take them back or are they ok\"  When would cold mashed potatoes ever be OK?  When her potatoes were brought back warmed, she was disappointed because they were called \"garlic mashed\" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at all. I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  It was described as \"grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a Kaiser roll\"  No mention of a tomato.  When I got the sandwich, there were three tomatoes on it.   Thankfully I just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue.  There was also no pineapple chutney.  When I asked about it, the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the roll. Overall, very disappointed.  I wanted to love Olive or Twist because I really enjoyed the time I had visited for a drink, but the dining experience was sorely lacking, especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Everything we ordered was delightful. Definitely a twist on even the most simple things. Cooked to perfect, will return!"}
{"text":"I love the calamari appetizer here -- and recently, not only did they remove it from the happy hour menu, but they cut the size by more than half and kept the price the same. Shame on you!   Additionally, they told me and my friends that all the tables were booked, and we sat at the bar for over an hour and all the tables were empty. Why are you trying to be more exclusive than you actually are? It's not good for business."}
{"text":"Summary: A fine place for a bite before the show or a drink/desert after  My wife and I went to Olive or Twist before a show at the Benedum on a recent week night. Two immediate points in their favor: 1. I was able to make a reservation that afternoon 2. At the time I made the reservation, they asked if I was going to a show afterward - showing attention in advance to making sure I would have a good experience with them.  We arrived a couple of minutes after our reservation and were seated immediately [at what appeared to be the last open table in the room]. The wait person asked when we were seated about whether we were headed to a show. Good on them.  The service was generally very prompt, if not a touch harried. More than one staff member was covering our table.  On the one hand, this ensured that we were taken care of promptly. On the other hand, there were several occasions when we were asked the same thing by multiple staff members. (E.g., \"Would you like to place a drink order? We already have.\") I think this is a net positive for someone with a show to get to, but it does detract somewhat from a relaxing meal.  We shared an Ahi Tuna appetizer. I've seen larger portions of this appetizer elsewhere - nearly every elsewhere. This was barely big enough to share. Mind you, they didn't advertise it for sharing and it would have been entirely reasonable for one person.  Similarly with the entree salads we both had. The looked small at first, but only because of the ridiculous portion sizes we have grown accustomed to at many other restaurants. The added protein portions were also not generous, but they were probably really a reasonable size for a normal adult - one who's not try to keep getting larger. (Overall, I applaud what I perceive to be a trend away from super-sized portions at some restaurants.) My wife had shrimp on hers and seemed happy. I had chicken on mine, which was a touch on the dry side, but overall I was satisfied.  I'm not normally a martini guy, but I tried a non-traditional one before dinner - the \"Perfect Pear\". It was fine, as far as I could tell, but I'm not a convert. I'll likely get a glass of wine the next time. My wife had a glass of white wine (I'm afraid I forget which) and was well satisfied with it.  We shared a Chocolate Covered Pretzel martini and a slice of the Chocolate Torte for desert. Viewing the martini as a desert, rather than as a drink, it was quite good. It was tasty and well presented, with the salted rim (a la a margarita) being a big part of the pretzel effect. It was a nice complement to the torte, which was quite rich, and very good. Sharing a single slice was an excellent choice for us. I would do this combination again.  We were out the door in about 70 minutes without having felt rushed, and with 30 minutes still to get to our seats in the theater. Overall, good food, drinks and service. I'll be back when I can."}
{"text":"This place had a really cool feeling to it! We went on a Saturday night and made reservations about 2 wks in advance. The food was all around pretty good but it was definitely tight. You will probably get a elbow or a butt hit you at least once :)"}
{"text":"If you enjoy Martinis, then Olive-or-Twist is a must-see!  :)  Near the Lemongrass Cafe and the Renaissance Hotel, It's a cozy little bar; it's narrow and has an exposed-brick, jazz-house type of feel to it. Very dimly lit, a great little spot for an evening drink before or after a show in the Cultural District of Pittsburgh!  Obviously, their specialty is going to be martinis and they do a nice job of offering up traditional martinis as well as some fruity, tasty, sweet martinis.  They also serve food and have a nice sized menu; I've never had the opportunity to eat here, but some of the things that were coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled delish!  The crowd here is typically young, trendy and professional. By Day, its a great spot for suits to grab a quick cocktail and something to eat. By 4:30, its filling up with more suits and skirts, for the after-work crowd in downtown. By the evening, you'll have the trendy, young types. (I'm also fully convinced that this is where trendy wanna-be types will go to dress up, as-if they were at work for the day, and then go to hang out to rub elbows with those who actually do work!  lol)  This is a great place to go before or after baseball games, theater shows, and just because.  PROS: Atmosphere is a pro, here.  Pretty laid back, IMO; Great idea-inducing drink menu if you have no idea what you'd like to drink; Lots of suggestions if you want to \"try something new\"; Also serves food.  CONS: Parking is terrible (as with all things, Pittsburgh.  Try the garage across from the Renaissance Hotel); eh... a tad bit pricey for \"just a lot of vodka\", lol; it gets pretty full, pretty quick (which can also be a PRO depending on whom you ask).   *Update to follow, soon. (Its been a little while since I was there last)"}
{"text":"Tried to order  one of the 5 dinner specials...the lobster mac and cheese and they were out (at only 7 pm... prime time dinner hr).... so I ordered the peppered salmon with mango salsa.... they brought me my meal but with no mango salsa.... just the salmon...all by itself.  I asked the waitress... didn't this come with the mango salsa topping?  She said oh yea it does... but we ran out that's why they didn't put it on..... needless to say.. it would be tough to eat peppered salmon with no salsa or sauce at all to offset the pepper.    I wasn't sure what to do at this point...so she said do you want some other sauce or something?  We asked her to check with the chef as to what he/she suggests.  5 min later she comes out and says they r going to make a new batch of mango salsa....I think to myself... I thought you were out and now they are making it?  Why didn't they do that in the first place.  They left my plate in front of me and 10 mins later they come out with a small bowl of salsa... by this time the rest of my table were done with their food...the meal was good with the salsa... but by now I was eating with everyone else done and my food was luke warm.  For a $20 meal at a  high end restaurant. ..This was quite a disappointment."}
{"text":"So I decided to surprise my fiancé one night by taking her here(because we've been talking about doing so for a while). We both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps. The martinis were just ok, and the food was very basic and nothing special. I will give the place another try and get some non appetizers next time and hope the bartender is a bit better at mixing the drinks."}
{"text":"I selected Olive or Twist for my sister's birthday dinner, mainly because the name drew me in. I made a reservation and was told there were only two timeslots available. Fortunately, one of them was fairly close to the time I was hoping for, so I went ahead and booked it. The only reason I mention this is that when we arrived, there were only two other tables in use and no one else came in the entire time we were there, which seemed a bit odd.  However, that small bit aside, the meal and experience were excellent. We both ordered the penne with vodka cream sauce, and it was absolutely delicious, as were the appetizer and drinks. I will say that they certainly do not skimp on their martinis! I generally feel that martinis tend to be on the weak side, but I actually found this one to be too strong for my taste -- fortunately, the waitress kindly offered to have the bartender lighten it up for me. On that note, they have many creative and traditional drink choices, so you can feel confident that there will be something everyone will enjoy.   The service was exceptional -- our waitress did a wonderful job and we particularly enjoyed the quiet atmosphere. We did go on a Monday night when I'm sure it was much slower than usual, but still, it seemed much quieter than your typical bar scene. It can get pricey, but it's worth it for a special occasion. All in all, a great place to go for dinner and/or drinks in an intimate setting."}
{"text":"My happy hour hot spot! My friends are addicted to the buffalo chicken dip. Drink specials and great food selection."}
{"text":"Friday night girls night out and we were on the town. Olive or Twist located near the cultural district right across from the theater was the place to be. It is mostly the young professional crowd. The decor is brick with lounge couches upstairs, welcoming you to grab a martini and have a seat while searching eyes as people go by.  I can't say this is a south side meat market vibe but the young are here to mix and meet. This particular night we were full of giggles and playful flirtations. There was some kind of CMU business men event going on and within a minute the bar was packed with young eligible bachelors in suits. Way too dressy for my taste but it was fun to talk and check people out. Everyone was friendly and from my perch on the bar it seemed everyone had mixed drinks in hand so I joined in with my signature dirty martini. It was made just right. The ambiance and music was light. I was having a good time and an even better time when offered drinks and striking up conversation. I didn't get to sample the food because we had already eaten but I will def be back. This place would be ideal for a date night. Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot when I was in college for apps and drinks before Benedum & Heinz Hall shows. Rather small dining area- you have to make a reservation or get here a little early on those show nights. The sticky wings & buffalo chicken dip w/ chips are the best! Also enjoyed the chicken Caesar salad ... but this place is also known for the Martini Sampler during Happy Hours... You'll see many people during Happy Hour testing the different selections of Martinis! Consider Olive or Twist the next time you want a modern, mellow spot for grabbing a bite & a drink w/ a friend or significant other, especially before/after watching a Broadway show nearby!  Cons: Wait staff isn't the greatest - you may be waiting a while for a drink refill or check. Restaurant area is very small. A little pricey for the portions."}
{"text":"The cocktail menu options were mouth-watering. Great place to grab a drink with friends, especially on ladies' night out!"}
{"text":"What can I say about you Olive - you're my staple, my default, but not in a bad way.  I know during those indecisive evenings which taunt me, I can always turn to you for comfort, good atmosphere, delectable food and a tasty drink.  While you're not always top of mind with the emerging bar/restaurant scene in the area, I do remember you often and stop by occasionally.  You are my go-to for happy hours that bring large groups of friends together with varying tastes.  B/c that's just who you are Olive...you appeal to the masses and don't just belong to me.  You make a killer martini and know how to attract the young professional community in the region.  What about Twist - well he brings that second wind after a long work week, the spark at the end of the night and makes you think, \"who knows where this night will take me\".  You make a perfect pair!    I'm glad we've become such close friends and you both always welcome me with open arms even when it's been a while."}
{"text":"Unreal. Made a reservation here well in advance. Got there early, ordered as soon as the waitress came over, as we were on a tight schedule to get to  the theater. Sat for exactly ONE HOUR without touching an ounce of food. The other tables around us were commenting on the terrible service as well. Finally brought soup after I had to ask for it twice. We had to leave immediately after, so we asked for the check and cancelled our dinners. No apologies and they didn't even comp the wine or soup on the bill! DO NOT COME HERE. Understaffed and unprepared for large crowds. They aren't usually open on Sundays but this weekend then opened to \"accommodate\" the Cultural District show traffic."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place is popular. A friend recommended this place to me. I went with my coworker and the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with great service. The Drinks were great. I had the Cake Batter and DragonBerry Cosmo. Then for food I order the Lobster Mac and Cheese. I can say I wasn't disappointed. If I ever come back to Pittsburgh, I know where to go!"}
{"text":"Four-stars for happy hour comfort.  I write this review in the context of a Friday night spontaneous happy hour.  Why four stars?  Primarily the comphy seating.  Drink selection is on par with most other swanky downtown locations (decent beer list with some fun cocktails sprinkled here and there) and the staff is what I would expect - prompt and curteous but nothing out of this world.  But then there are the chairs, couches, leather benches, and multitude of mini tables to put your drink down (which I often need to do as I have a tendency to flap my hands around while telling stories).  Upstairs is where it's at.  Note - you may want to give them a call first... the upstairs is booked for private parties sometimes and if you're stuck downstairs, it can get quite crowded."}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty have fallen....  Saturday night before a show, my husband and I return for appetizers. We get calamari, historically our favorite calamari ever, and nachos with chicken.  The calamari was no longer tossed with the delicious sauce, therefore I did it myself in the middle of the restaurant. Overall, still good calamari, but not the greatest.  However, the nachos, which are $11 plus an additional $5 for chicken, were awful.  They were tortilla chips with shredded cheese microwaved with tasteless \"pico\" some olives, sour cream and guacamole. The chicken tasted Like yesterday's leftovers thrown on top.  There was no saving these nachos.  Thankfully, our server took them off our bill.   The two of us have lots of fond memories at Olive or Twist, especially the night before our wedding.  However, after three consecutively bad trips to Olive or Twist, we are done."}
{"text":"One of my wife & my go-to options for drinks, apps, or a nightcap or three.  Drinks are always high quality & well-made.  Foods that we've had (primarily apps) are always delicious.  Beautiful atmosphere and an excellent hangout spot.  The brickwork is just awesome.  Live music most weekends can get very loud downstairs, but if it's too much, there's a separate lounge upstairs that's also excellent.  Been there quite a few times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Didn't think it was possible to make a bad Old Fashioned, but this place managed to make an undrinkable one. When it came with an entire orange wedge in the drink and one hanging off the glass, I should've known. Avoid. Go to The Butcher and the Rye down the street."}
{"text":"Olive or Twist has the best martinis.  Cake Batter is a personal favorite.  While I usually stop with friends for a martini after a downtown event, I recently went here for dinner and a drink before a Pirates game.  Both were excellent!"}
{"text":"I went to Six Penn Kitchen with my cousin and had a great time. We decided to continue the night at Olive or Twist. Their cocktail menu was nice with some great pairings. Be warned that the prices are not featured on the menu.  They have everything from a great twist on an Old Fashioned to building your own Mule. We came on a Tuesday night so there weren't many people in the restaurant. The bartender was very attentive and even shared the best times to come to the restaurant.   The decor is rustic with exposed brick and and large antique looking ceiling fans. This is the perfect place to have drinks and conversation. Although, I am not sure what this place would be like on a busy night.   The draft selections were typical with a few rare finds. The best part was the purse hooks under the bar for the ladies. I would give another star but I did not try the food."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best martini bars anywhere in the area. I've been here numerous times and have always enjoyed it here. Drinks are amazing and you get a good buzz off of just one martini. Very generous pours here. Can be pricey if you have a few though."}
{"text":"I loved the upstairs lounge. It got a bit noisy but otherwise this is my kind of place. Open space, not too fussy with an upscale feel. Excellent martinis."}
{"text":"We went here for drinks and a bite before a concert at nearby Byham theater. We had wings and a piece of cookies and cream cake. Both were outstanding. We both had the Fat Gary's Ale, but in hindsight I would have preferred a Guinness. The ambiance was suitably cave-like as a good bar should be."}
{"text":"Coming in on a Saturday night, we were able to start off with seats at the bar and then, moved to a plush seated section up on the second floor.  Staff was super friendly and I loved our bartender.  We definitely had a lot of fun trying out all of the yummy drinks between our group of girls.  We all had a sip each of Le Fiz, Pink Lemonade, Cucumber Basil, Root Beer Float, Mixed Berry Tea, Guava Mojito, Dewar's Arnold Palmer, Huckleberry Mojito, Pomegranate Acai Mojito (mojitos were a hit with the girls), Dark Knight (with Elderflower liqueur and creme de violette), Jameson's Ginger, The Perfect Pear, and Lemon Ginger.  Overall, a great place to stop in for drinks.  We had a group of five ladies and had no problem finding a place for us to sit down around 9pm.  We were also able to redeem a restaurant.com gift certificate here, too!  If we ever return to Pittsburgh, I wouldn't mind popping back in again."}
{"text":"This place is good for drink before and after shows. I always wanted to try their food, but haven't yet. They have lots of different martinis. I will be back."}
{"text":"After hearing many positive things about the martinis here, we finally made our way down to experience it for ourselves. It was totally worth it!   We arrived around midnight on a Friday (well, technically Saturday I guess) and there still was a decent crowd being the place is downtown. We ordered our drink upstairs and eventually made our way back downstairs and sat outside so my boyfriend and his friends could smoke. The upstairs is fairly big and definitely had enough room so you don't feel packed together. There is your basic bar seating, as well as couches and chairs that give it a lounge sort of feel. It didn't take anytime at all for a friendly bartender to notice us and take our drink order.   They had a lot of really interesting sounding drinks, but we decided to go with the Pumpkin Spice martini because it's October (like, duh!!). Wow! Now, I'm not one for martinis as I have mentioned in previous reviews for other places, but this was amazing! The best martini I've ever had. So delicious and super easy to take down, yet you could still taste the alcohol so you know they didn't short you.   After spending some time upstairs, we traveled downstairs to check out the first floor. There was definitely a different vibe. It was slightly older and not as bumping. I also got to take a peak at their menu because I would love to come back and try their food.   As I mentioned above, we ended our night outside as they have a few tables and chairs. This is always the best because sometimes it's nice to escape the madness of a bar, especially if you're out with smokers. OOT is also located near the Cultural District so I didn't feel unsafe standing outside at a late hour."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try because of the $10 for $20 yelp deal. Had a bowl of \"chunky\" clam chowder which was tomato based & excellent! Sort of small for a bowl. I also tried the cobb salad which had lots of huge chunks of turkey but was lacking much of the other ingredients including luttace. It was definetly not worth 16 bucks. I would not go to this place again without another coupon to entice me. However the service was outstanding and atmosphere is pretty cool."}
{"text":"The bar staff is great, but the food quality has definitely taken a downward turn over the past year. I was recently at the bar and was overcome by a foul smell. For those of you that know what Urnex is, that's exactly what I thought (and hoped) it was. Alas, I was told by the bar staff that it was the scallops. Worse yet, they said they come from a can. I nearly puked. I love this place so much, but I am terribly saddened by the lack of the quality in the dishes coming out of the kitchen these days."}
{"text":"I could probably say more about Olive or Twist if I didn't black out every time I've gone. The martinis are super good and the food is also pretty decent. It can be pretty busy though and difficult to get service. They are also always renting out the top room (good for them!) which makes a small bar feel even smaller. There is a reason why this place is so popular downtown and it is a solid place. It isn't a standout but I definitely go there more than I go to a lot of the standout places in the city."}
{"text":"Sooo blacked out here that We heckled the guitarist. Not sorry. He sucked."}
{"text":"We ordered the calamari, caprese salad, and truffle fries. The calamari was probably the best flavorful calamari I've had with its crispiness that was not hidden by the delicious and zesty Asian sauce. Everything was plated nicely, and the caprese salad was quite good for winter tomatoes. I'm not much of a french fry person (I know, kill me), but the basil aioli complemented the parmesan.   Great appetizers in the heart of the Cultural District! I was sad that we barely missed the 4PM-6PM Happy Hour (Monday-Thursday), but that's life. I visited Olive or Twist last week before The Second City improv show, and I highly recommend it if you are going to a show as well."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food. However this is a really nice place to have a drink or two. The upstairs is really nicely laid out. Nice atmosphere and the service has always been very good. Prices are also reasonable for downtown. It's also a really good place to people watch after a Pirate game lets out.. Some real characters..."}
{"text":"Solid place to grab a martini and listen to some sub-par live music. Far from amazing but hey not everywhere is going to be right?"}
{"text":"Don't bother.   We were kind of desperate to find a place that wasn't too pricy and close to our hotel on a Monday night. We saw this place, with the low lighting and witty name (although we weren't sure if they're cleaver enough to make the theater reference or if it was simply a mistake).  They boast a new menu and I got the pasta with goat cheese and almonds. I didn't have high expectations but this was like family meal before your serving shift. It was boring and flavor free. My boyfriend got a steak sandwich that looked punny. Oh, and the grocery store wine was way over priced.  Boo!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite happy hour spot in Pittsburgh. Amazing atmosphere with an even more awesome staff. Friendly, hip and chic environment that I will come back to for every happy hour!"}
{"text":"I've only had drinks and appetizers here, so take this with the proverbial grain of salt. This is the my bar of choice when I'm in town and going out with my Yinzer colleagues for after-work libations. They have good happy hour specials, a nice beer and wine selection, and they mix a good cocktail. Oh, and the truffle fries are the bomb. Service is always fast and friendly, too."}
{"text":"Love olive or twist. Chill atmosphere. Great drinks!"}
{"text":"I had the Pork Belly sandwich with sweet potato fries, girlfriend had chicken quesadilla with truffle fries, dad had the burger, mom had the Reuben. Everything was great, great service, will go again!!"}
{"text":"Good drinks and a good appetizer to snack on. I gave four stars because the bar is kind of informal and I did not like the crowds.  it's a martini bar but it feels like a dive bar. The music was great.  if I had a choice I will give one a  four and a half stars. The location is very central and I had a beer. My friend had a \"dark knight\" he said it was good. They even made my beer from two different varieties because I like a black and blond. Try it. Maybe go  earlier than  9pm on a Friday."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a drink yesterday and to meet some friends at the upstairs lounge. Love it! So spacious, great art work on the walls and the bartenders were extremely nice and attentive. The happy hour drink prices were also pretty good. I didn't get a chance to try any food but I did wander down for a minute and it seemed like everyone was having a good time. I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"The drinks are perrrrrrrrfect!  Totally hit the spot.  Favorites are cookie dough and cake batter.  Though the drinks are 5 star, the food leaves much to be desired.  Prices are high and the taste subpar.  I have had the crab cake - small, dry, expensive and the scallops - large, dry, expensive with an interesting strawberry garnish that I thought was an odd addition for the flavoring produced.    Anywho, get a drink off the menu - well worth the price and yuuuuuumy taste!"}
{"text":"Went here several months ago, excited to try the myriad martinis on the list.  We had a restaurant.com certificate so that availability might make me return for value only.  The boyfriend got a tuna melt which was completely unremarkable; it seems to have been removed from the menu now.  We got 4 martinis between us--the Pink Lemonade (okay), Orange Dreamsicle (sickly sweet), Cake Batter (again, just tasted like sugar), and the Black and Gold (this admittedly was excellent).  The waitress helped us pick our selections so I was surprised at the lack of balance in these for a place seeming to specialize in martinis.    Bottom line, happy hour + restaurant.com certificate might make this worthwhile, especially with a more careful eye towards sugar-overload.  And get the Black and Gold."}
{"text":"So I came into the restaurant for lunch and the soup was so yummy. I had the Stuff pepper soup one day. And the cream of mushroom. There soup is always really good and flavorful"}
{"text":"Stopped by after enjoying \"Young Frankenstein\" at the Byham Theatre.    This venue is just a short walk across the street from the Byham so was very convenient.  The interior has a very pleasant atmosphere.  We sat at the bar to have drinks and an appetizer.  With the kind bartender's help, I ordered the chocolate pretzel martini.  My glass was decorated with chocolate stripes on the inside and a rim covered with chocolate and salt.  This was definitely a winner in both presentation and taste.  We ordered the nachos without any protein added.  They looked good but there wasn't enough topping for the number of chips so many chips were eaten dry without anything on it.  Definitely needed more cheese and \"goo\" to make these worthwhile.  The appetizer part of the menu was good and priced right so I'd come back and just try something else next time."}
{"text":"Cute spot and staff is hilarious! I had a blast last week and can't wait to go back:)"}
{"text":"Didn't imagine a hip but chill place like this in downtown Pittsburgh. The music isn't overly loud, and it's a great place to hang out with friends. Or some family, in my case ;)  They have a second floor with ample mingle space, even a little side room you can rent out if you have a big group. The price for the room was pretty cheap (around $50), so it makes for a great private party space.  The drinks are pretty good and strong, and they have a lot of good alcohol selection if you don't like the cocktail list they offer. They specialize in martinis, so try one to decide for yourself if you like it."}
{"text":"Found you on Yelp and weren't disappointed. Very friendly waitstaff and good food (bar fare). Yummy desserts. The acoustics downstairs were terrible. Exposed brick everywhere and no noise dampening.  Not the best place for an intimate dinner or quiet conversation on the weekend. But a young, fun, party like atmosphere. Convenient to cultural district."}
{"text":"I have only sat at the bar here and only have had a Martini.  In saying that, I like how friendly this place is and the staff is attentive.  They make a mean Martini for $10.00.   The place is clean and so are the bathrooms."}
{"text":"One of worst experiences.  We sat at the bar to eat before a show.  It took a while for the bartender to acknowledge us.  Once we ordered it took over 30 minutes for the food to come.  My crab cake was completely black on the underneath.  I didn't have time to get anything else since it took so long to begin with so I went to the show starving.  My husband got the lobster Mac n cheese.  It was horrible.  Tasted like a bowl of pasta covered in salt.  There wasn't any cheese in it.  There were other groups there complaining as well.  One was there before us and never even got there food.  I won't even give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Olive or Twist is convenient place to go before or after shows in Pittsburgh's Cultural District or Pirates baseball games. The inside is very nice, pleasant and comfortable. I was there on a Friday. The entertainment was excellent (a one-man band by the name of Mark Pipas -- who played music from all genres and rarely took breaks). The bar tenders are friendly and make great drinks, but if the place gets busy -- be warned -- the service can be tragically slow. I didn't have food, but the food that I saw looked good. My biggest complaint is the drink prices. I realize that this is a downtown establishment. It's somewhat upscale, but it's not the Ritz. I'm not at all cheap, but $4.25 for an IC Light, $7.75 for a normal-size Captain and Coke and $7.75 for a shot of Jaeger (though it was a generous pour), is a bit high for such a social bar in Pittsburgh, even if it's downtown, and even if it's somewhat upscale."}
{"text":"Underpriced 4-star cocktails and overpriced 3-star food. Good spot to meet friends but not a great date venue."}
{"text":"I go here pretty often for drinks. They have the best variety of martinis and it's lively in the evenings. The buffalo chicken spread is highlyyyy recommended."}
{"text":"So, groupon made this evening possible.  Thank you, groupon.  Picked my husband up from work in Market Square and walked over to Olive or Twist at about 5 pm. Parkings a b***.  I'm so glad we walked.  It was happy hour on friday and the bar was packed FULL.  Buzzing with business men and women looking to loosen their collars for the weekend.  The place seemed alive.   We edged our way around the bar to the hostess table where we were warmly greeted and sat quickly (make a reservation though...we were only sat because aparently another party canceled even though the dining room was empty? whatever its fine) Was a little too loud from the bar, for a couple looking for a romantic dining experience but I'm not complaining.  We were seated in the dining room wich has beautiful rustic brick walls revealed and a warm ambiance.  I was really excited about the menu. Everything on it sounded decadent.  So much so, that I couldn't decide and ordered TWO entree's!  I never do that.  I ordered the Fettucini Boursin (reccomended by the waitress) and their  Pear & Candied Pecan Salad (I added chicken for $2)   ............. The salad--- FABULOUS.  Bleu cheese crumbles atop mixed greens, a crisp fresh sliced pear, and the most amazing strawberry vinagarette I have ever had. The chicken I added was very juicy. The only downer about the salad, is I hardly got any candied pecans... they were few and far between and when I did get some, they were more like candied pecan crumbs you find at the bottom of the bag.  That just told me the chef for whatever reason, must have been out of them.  But if your going to call it a pear and candied pecan salad, it needs to have a reasonable amount of pecans.    ...............................Next, was the Fetuccini Boursin.  The waitress raved about this, and I think I see why.  They top it with a yummy sharp cheese shaved in a pile that is really delicious. But for me, the plate in general was a bit dry and the sauce was the consitency of elmers glue..not just thick, I mean... sticky and dry.  I like it more moist.  In my opinion, Olive Gardens fettucini is better, but it satisfied my pasta craving, nevertheless.    My husband ordered the Carribean Jerk Chicken Sandwich with a side of broccoli instead of fries.   HE LOVED EVERY BITE.   He was hesitant to even let me have a taste he wanted it all to himself.     Our waitress was so kind and welcoming.   Overall, it was a great experience.  We enjoyed it and it made for a nice evening.  We will probably come back,but not without another coupon.  Its questionable wether the food is truly worth full price or not, but thats just my opinion.   I really want to try their happy hour drinks.  They looked delicious, and obviously they are, if they are drawing such a crowd.  This is a nice little place :)  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I came here before a pirates game, so it was around 5:30ish or so in the evening, we had just gotten lucky that they had a table open before all there reservations for the night started to come in.  I ordered the chicken jerk sandwich with a side salad, absolutely loved it!  The chicken had the perfect amount of spice to it which was off set with sweet with the pineapple chutney it had on it, sooo good!  The salad was even great because they used real green spring mix instead of iceburg lettuce.  I also loved that they put feta cheese on top, its one of my favorite cheeses for salad topping!  Service was great here and even though I didn't have a drink here that night I have a previous time and they are yummy!  Love this place and can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I went here after work around 4:30 without a reservation with my friend and it was the best time to come. Their happy hour is 4-6 on the weekdays and I was able to get $4 Cabernet that was really delicious. There were reservations on every table, but not until around 7 so we had time to enjoy ourselves. I got the jerk chicken sandwich on the recommendation of the server and I have to tell you it was delicious!! The chicken wasn't too dry and the jerk seasonings were perfect. I also got the sweet potato fries for a side and they were very good. I wish they were a little more crispy, but they were still good. We also ordered the creme brûlée and I ordered the black manhattan drink to go along. Both were just amazing and exactly what I wanted for after a delicious, but not too filling dinner. Drinks were top notch."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant since it was close to the Byham and an easy walk for my elderly parents.  When I realized we were going, I purchased a Groupon. The seating is very limited so reservations on a Friday or Saturday night are a must. The menu is very limited with only about 5 or 6 entrees not including sandwiches and wraps that are offered.  So check out the menu online to make sure you find something you like. It is very noisy due to the small seating area, the nearby bar and the brick interior.  The braised short ribs were very tasty and tender. The vodka penne with chicken was good.  In summary, if you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner for a special occasion, this is not the place.  However, for a good meal convenient in the theatre district, Olive or Twist is a fine choice."}
{"text":"I got a pack of those City Dining Cards (you get $10 off on a $30 minimum food purchase at participating restaurants) and decided to use the Olive or Twist card for a dinner prior to seeing the Phantom of the Opera at the Benedum.  I've been to this place once before for dinner and a couple of other times just for drinks. I've never really been blown away by my experiences there but I've never had any reason to complain either.  I got there at 6:00 and the place was pretty packed with the happy hour crew and theater goers but I got lucky and nabbed the last two stools at the end of the bar. I was greeted cheerfully and almost immediately by the bartender who showed me the beer list. I choose to stay local ordering an East End Fat Gary and looked over the menu as I waited for my date to arrive.  Although it was a little loud, the atmosphere was very comfortable and my lady and I contributed to the noise as we discussed how our day went before ordering off of the menu. I was torn between the Crispy Braised Pork Belly Sandwich and the Pan-Seared Atlantic Char. But my decision got easier when my date choose the char... we have this rule that we will never get the same thing so that we can share each other's entrée.  Our orders came about 15 minutes later. The pork belly was amazing! Cheddar, bacon, lettuce, tomato and a creamy sauce topped the pork belly in between a really fresh Ciabatta bun. Mmmm, delicious! It also came with a side and being as cold as it has been, the tomato basil soup was nice compliment to the sandwich. Off course I got to taste the Atlantic Char that my girlfriend ordered. It looked and tasted a little like a good cut of salmon only a little thicker and saltier. It was good, but I really think that my sandwich was the tastier of the two meals.  Olive or Twist? I'd say it's a good pre-theater option and I'd recommend it. The service was good, the bartender was attentive, the food was excellent and the price was competitive for the area. My only knock, and it's really not much of a knock, is that I think the serving portions are a little less than what we here in America have grown accustomed to. Most restaurants serve you much more food than you really should consume and that's one of the reasons why we here in America have more of an obesity issue than other nations."}
{"text":"I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus, but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes.  It would've been different if she had been slammed, but the entire time she was standing by the bar, just talking to her coworkers.  By the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired.  When we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us.  The one positive of the place was that I liked the ambiance, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster.  What I was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood."}
{"text":"Back when I lived in Pittsburgh, this was #1 on my list for late night drinks.  They have a small seating area and bar downstairs, with live music on the weekends.  Upstairs is another bar and a large lounge area with trendy music playing in the background.  They're open late, and they have amazing drinks and appetizers.  I never ate there for lunch or dinner, so I can't comment about their main dishes...but I can definitely attest to their drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night before the Nationals-Pirates game (go Nats!!!). We were lucky to find seats at the bar, considering the few tables for people without reservations were taken and getting a reservation here is serious business, apparently. I had a decent pour of pinot grigio and my boyfriend had a beer, both probably a little overpriced but what can ya do. The buffalo dip appetizer was served in a martini glass (nice touch) and came with a ton of really nice pita slices. FAN. I got a grilled cheese with tomato soup, and wasn't happy to find tomato slices in the grilled cheese sandwich since I am 99% sure it was not listed as having tomatoes inside it on the menu (I know I know, I like tomato soup but not raw tomatoes, get over it). When I took the tomato slices off of the sandwich, a woman at the bar next to me voiced her displeasure with my action to her husband. I'm sorry, is this your sandwich?? BYE. Anyways, the soup was great and the de-tomatoed sandwich was delicious too. My boyfriend got sweet potato fries (YUM) and a steak sandwich which I enjoyed stealing bites of. All in all we had a pleasant experience, only made better by our groupon!"}
{"text":"If you are a female group be prepared to be ignored by the male bartenders.  Stood patiently to get waited at the bar upstairs a male customer came up and he quickly served he pointed out to the bartender we had been standing there and he just looked at him like so what.  Guess the men at olive or Twist only like men."}
{"text":"In town on business and I always try to find places like this.  Wow, a martini bar not named the Blue Martini?  OK, I'm in!  So I strolled over and walked in.  First impression was it was a cool, cozy, and trendy joint.  Liked the exposed brick walls, lighting, etc.  Only problem is, I don't go to a restaurant or a bar to eat and drink the atmosphere!  So I grab a table in the bar.  It was about 5pm and there might have been 15 people in the whole place.  Two bartenders made eye contact with me so I figured they would be waiting on me.  I figured wrong.  I sat there for a good ten minutes and was getting ready to get up and leave when the younger tender came over and said with a \"deer in the headlights look\", do you want a drink or something????  Well hell, what was your first guess?  I refrained from quoting Foxworthy and saying \"here's your sign\"!  So OK we were off to a bumpy start.  I didn't have a martini, however there was a few options on the drink menu.  I was just here for a bite, so my review is based on that.  A few minutes later the other bartender comes back with my water and gives me a menu.  I ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side.  I say \"some\" turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive!    It seemed to take forever for it to arrive.  Given the fact that it wasn't busy, it did take a long time to arrive.  When it did, it looked OK.  The fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash, so I bypassed that.  The wrap just had zero flavor and was loaded with lettuce........way to much.  The only flavor that presented itself was blandness!  It was very disappointing.  All in all, I think this is probably a way better bar to have a drink in then a restaurant.  I will return to try a martini, but I will pass on the food."}
{"text":"Me and one of my besties recently came here for a girl's night out on the town.  Since we're both parents and don't get out often without our children in tow, we wanted to make sure that we fully enjoy our food and drink wherever we decide to go.  We actually enjoyed ourselves very much, thank you, at this wonderful downtown spot.  We both ordered specialty martinis.  I had the Pink Lemonade and she had the Dragon Berry Cosmo.  Both drinks were delicious!  We also ordered Olive or Twist Calamari and the Thai Chicken wings as appetizers. (Yes, I know that's a lot of food for two people.  But, didn't I say we don't get out much in the evening without kids in tow?)  Yummy is the word for both.  I like my wings crispy and my calamari not overdone and both fit the bill.  Now, about my braised beef short ribs.  Like some people wouldwalk a mile for a Camel, I would walk 10 miles for beef short ribs.  If I can take my fork and push the meat into collapse and have a good sauce to go with, I'm all yours!  My last name should now be \"OliveOrTwist\"!  Likewise, my bestie sat in silence and payed homage to the crabcake gods/goddesses that prepared her crabcakes.  A moment of slence please....  Okay, I'm back.  But seriously, if you want to feel transported from Pittsburgh and imagine yourself in a hip little bar/restaurant in a more trendy city, this is your place."}
{"text":"The Partner In Cuisine (PIC) and I had an early dinner there recently thanks to Groupon and we were not disappointed.  Since we weren't sure what to get and were just generically hungry, we decided to just let the menu decide for us and we ordered one of each of the highlighted items on the menu - the \"house specials\" according to our server.  The calamari was excellent and it was apparent that it had been hand breaded.  The Asian fusion made for a delicious alternative to the typical calamari that was reminiscent of a General Tso's squid.  The main dishes were also good, but nothing in particular stuck out about them.  I also had a red-velved martini which I thought was probably the best part of the meal.  Overall, I would definitely go back on a weeknight for happy hour or on a Tuesday to try the variety of mini martinis, but I think I'll leave paying $9 for an alcoholic beverage to \"special\" nights and not just a typical weekend dinner.  They do lose a star because even though we were one of three occupied tables and a few taken seats at the bar, the service was incredibly slow.  It took so long for our appetizer to come out, I began to question whether the cook had to get in his car and go down to Wholey's to buy more squid."}
{"text":"Bossa Nova's step-sister bar, but not the evil jealous step sister more like the older a little more mature caring step-sister. At least in the way of making a carefully crafted unique martini or cocktail.   Atmosphere is a little more cramped, but usually you can still find a table late on a week or weekend night if you do not mind sitting in the back. It is fine for me because I don't like being sandwiched at the bar with other people's conversations in my face.   I didn't try the food but my friend ordered the Tuna appetizer and she said she loved it just wished the portions were a little better. But for the price it wasn't bad.   I ordered the Perfect Pear cocktail with Pear Absolute Eldleweiss flower liqouer and a splash of pineapple juice it was delicious! Not too sweet and I despise sweet drinks. The perfect blend of soft tangy tartness. Much more creative then the drink menu at Bossa Nova.  For the drop in spot after a show or just happy hour with friends I found this to be a pretty down to earth and decent spot. The waitress was not that great but she was young, some things are forgiven if the product is just right."}
{"text":"Great martins! Placed is decorated nicely and is appealing.....but quite noisy. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Before the Titanic at Benedum.  Good service and low crowd density.  Ordered entre of crab cakes for both of us.  Crab cakes were all fill and virtually no crab, and dry.  Sauce on the side appeared to be Grey Poupon?  We asked for melted butter instead and that took a moment of thought about if it could be done as a substitute.  Asparagas was mismatched on stalks and tips in my view.  And very low proportion of asparagus.  For an entre, this did not make the grade at all.  As an aside we have had crab cakes in many places to include Maryland... I doubt we will return.  I should have had the calamari appetizer."}
{"text":"Girls night had to happen. We decided to go to Olive or Twist, because it was close and I did have a coupon.   I was delighted with this bar/restaurant. I never knew that they had an upstairs! Upstairs they have couches and comfortable chairs with coffee tables in between them.  So much more comfortable than sitting on wooden or bar stools. And after a long day at work, being comfortable is really all that I am about. The music was slightly loud but still tolerable, and enjoyable because it was older rap music that we started to then sing and dance to (in our chairs!).  We all ordered food and drinks. I got the burger, which wasn't anything special, but I wasn't expecting the sun and the moon from it. My friends ordered the jerk chicken and the bean quesadilla. The jerk chicken was amazing. They had this jalapenos sauce on it, wooo hooo. It was so good. A perfect mix of sweet and spicy that was mouth watering. I kept on dipping my fries it in. Yummy!  The drinks were also perfect. I ordered the Wild Tea Mojito and the Pink Lemonade. Both of these drinks were refreshing and delicious. I just wanted to just go down the drink menu and check off all each and every one of those cocktails! I wanted to know if all of them could be as good as the two that I tried.   It was a great and comfortable experience for a bar. I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Scouring downtown Pittsburgh for a good spot Saturday night, we ended up at Olive or Twist, which was a delight.   Live music is always a plus for me. We wanted seats at the bar but there were only tables to the side that did not offer service available, which was more than fine for me.   I felt for what the establishment was, the drinks were a bit pricier than other places in town, but it's still fairly inexpensive in Pittsburgh. My friend ordered dinner despite stuffing our faces earlier. He couldn't finish his meal, but enjoyed it none the less.   Not a bad option to check out."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming and I still love it and especially the Buffalo chicken spread! The atmosphere is a little dark for lunch time but over all it was a good experience.The service was also great."}
{"text":"If your name is 'olive or twist' the employees behind the bar should be able to make a dirty martini that's tolerable.  Poor service too. Why come here?"}
{"text":"Olive Or Twist is a really cool place for drinks. The space is a little tight depending on what time you get there, but the drinks are very strong, unique and tasty! The service could be better and the staff could be friendlier but all and all, it is a good place to sit back, have a good, strong martini. I ordered the \"Perfect Pear\" martini recently and it was very strong tasting compared to the other time I had it. You get your money's worth of alcohol in their martinis for sure! This definitely is not a place where you get a watered down drink. The place is dimly lit and the walls are dark, which makes for a comfortable setting, no matter how busy the bar is. There is live music, which is very good and isn't loud to the point that you can't hold a conversation with those around you. I would definitely recommend this place for their strong, unique martinis with a punch that will have you feeling it in no time, as well as for their dark ambiance and live music. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Food is excellent. Portions could be a tad bigger.  Not that I was still hungry, just that it tasted that good.  Would suggest more entree selections.  Variety could be a bit better.  I'd also like to mention that I'd like to have the option of dining upstairs but only seems to be available to private functions.  Keep up the good work, and really appreciate the restaurant.com deal.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Always a great place to get a drink before or after a show. I've always enjoyed it here. The mixed drinks are very creative in how they make them....and they always look good even though my wife always orders them while I stick to Safire & Tonics, red wine or beer. I remember the calamari being in the top five in Pittsburgh.   The live music is usually pretty good. My only complaint is that the downstairs is a little small and gets very crowded very quickly. Pus the upstairs, while a tad more spacious, doesn't have a lot of seating so you just stand around a crowded bar too.   But, it's always a good time, the service has always been very good, and people don't realize there's more to this place than just drinks. The food is under rated and tasty. Always on a recommend to other list."}
{"text":"Drinks wise, Olive or Twist had some of the best and most creative drinks I had in Pittsburgh. There were two full pages of mixed cocktails and martinis. Someone like me that appreciates a finely made girly drink really loved this spot. Beer enthusiasts, like my husband, will leave disappointed since their beer list is pretty lacking.  We went on a Friday at about 6 and it was packed to the max downstairs. We were able to snag a table at the upstairs lounge and a server came over pretty quickly to wait on us. The Chocolate Covered Salted Pretzel Martini was my absolute fave and after a few of them, I felt delirious and slightly buzzed. I hate ordering drinks from a menu that has no prices -- seriously, though, we're not all made of money -- so I expected the worst. I was pleasantly surprised when I got the bill as I didn't think $9 was bad for the drink since it got me feeling reeeal good.  It felt like a great spot to hit up after a long week of work and I would definitely return should I find myself in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"Warning: Do NOT come here on a Saturday night. Cause that's what I did. And it sucked because nobody was there. Ok, not nobody, maybe like 12 people including the staff and my crew of 5.  It looked great in there, big comfy couches, a huge bar with a big selection, high ceilings with beautiful exposed brick, but empty.   I am not from around the area and was just in town visiting. I would go back, but definitely not on a Saturday night. Don't go on Saturday. Seriously, don't do it."}
{"text":"A haven for suits and the theater crowd, Olive or Twist has a great selection of creative martinis for all drinkers- from a dirty martini to a sweet martini- you'll find what you want. I love the nuts'n'berries.  They don't shy from new ideas either- a friend ordered a \"tootsie roll\" concoction she figured out (chocolate and orange liquor) and managed to have a delightful drinking experience.   Food is all right, not a place I consider for a full meal (though I've done it). I suggest it for drink potential and perhaps some appetizers."}
{"text":"This place has become a usual spot for date night and before events and games. Mainly come for the drinks. The Moscow mules ( my go-to drink) is  made perfectly here with different seasonal options. Apple cider mule is definitely worth going back for in the fall. Bartenders know their stuff and tweak drinks for your preferences. The special martinis never disappoint. I always seem to stick to the pear and rosemary. The food is pretty good. Even better because they often have groupons or deals running."}
{"text":"Have loved every martini I've tried! I especially loved the caramel apple in the Fall! Great spot for happy hour with friends!"}
{"text":"I am usually not one to go downtown, but hubby got a Group on for this place and I was so glad he did!!   This place is known to be a martini bar, and boy do they know their stuff.   When we arrived we were promptly seated and our waiter took our order. Since I am a sucker for cucumber, I opted for the cucumber basil martini. Let me tell ya, this beverage was not only pretty to look at but very tasty and refreshing to boot. My husband opted for one of their beers on draft.  For our main I decided to go for their braised short ribs which pretty darn good. The short ribs had this really tasty wine sauce, with a side of mashed potatoes and some really tasty asparagus. Everything about this dish was delectable.   My husband on the other hand, opted for their hamburger with some bacon and Swiss cheese. I had a taste of it and it was pretty good. My husband really liked and the fact that it was cooked to his specifications.   I really liked the ambiance of the place. The exposed brick the old bar. It just had a romantic feel to it. Definitely a good place for a first date as it is a little intimate.   Really like the fact that they can make a mean martini and the romantic decor. If I am ever in the neighborhood I will more than likely hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"We stopped in before the Yelp Elite CLO's A (Musical) Christmas Carol. This wasn't my first time at Olive or Twist - and I had enjoyed myself before. We had cocktails (tried a sip of each other's) and two appetizers:  -- Ruby Red Bellini: Deep Eddy Grapefruit Vodka, Aperol, Sugar Cane, Lime Prosecco -- Black and Gold Martini: Belvedere, Lemoncello, Chambord, Sours, Lemon -- Olive or Twist Calamari: Fresh Breaded Calamari, Zesty Asian Sauce, Scallions -- Crispy Kalettes: Kale, Sea Salt, Cracked Pepper, Parmesan  My bellini was outstanding; and, the martini was fantastic as well - both with fresh mixers and sugar rims. The calamari with an Asian twist was texturally and flavorfully delicious and actually paired very well with the fried kale. The combination of our cocktails and two appetizers was a perfect pre-theater experience - especially with the Byham right across the street (and Heinz Hall right down the street) and a parking garage right next door.  The only negative note I have is that service was a bit slow; however, we were there at 5:30 (with the Steelers/Colts Sunday Night Football game later in the evening). Overall, I'm a fan of Olive or Twist - the cocktails, food, price, and location!"}
{"text":"Good drinks (I had the guava margarita and the peach martini) and great music selection. I didn't eat - but I plan on going back soon to try the food!"}
{"text":"Nice surprise.  Expecting bar food when looking for a quick dinner while in town on business from Florida, we were presently surprised by the variety and quality at a reasonable price. The Buffalo Chicken spread was a flavorful hummus fare served with pita bites that were wonderful while warm. I had the Ahi Tuna Taco Platter that was tasty as well. The house Merlot was short of the $9/glass price, but overall this was time and money well spent."}
{"text":"I went here couple of month ago for late night drink.  I was a little drunk when I went in here, just a little bit, so I don't recall things quite precisely but I liked the atmosphere. Dim lighting which I liked. Friendly staff. Nothing special for drinks."}
{"text":"So I had previously visited olive or twist with my boyfriend a couple months back, and we were a bit underwhelmed.  I luckily decided to give it another chance.  My mom and I dined here before seeing a show.  We arrived at 6:20 on a Friday and luckily made it in time for happy hour, $5 glasses of wine and half price crispy kalettes for us! Our service was speedy (and very pleasant), so we were able to order second glasses before the special was over.  Our kalettes were very interesting! Crispy and cheesy, my favorite! I ordered the lobster mac and cheese and my mom ordered the poutine fries.  We both enjoyed our dishes and we shared, so I can vouch for both entrees when I say they're tasty and filling!  Perhaps our favorite part of the evening, however, was the banana caramel xango.  It was delicious and it was prepared so that it was perfect for sharing!"}
{"text":"The restaurant.com voucher sure helped me out. The prices were very high for average sized portions. We came here for a celebration so ordered the works--entrees, appetizers, dessert. The dessert xango was omg great! The wings here were pretty tasty but their scallop dish could have used more flavor. We came here on a Wed night and it was hella crowded. I made a reservation and we still had to wait 20 minutes for our spot! The space is tiny, dark and crowded and we eventually got seated next to the long queue of people waiting for their seats :(. Atmosphere = C, Service = A-. Food = B+"}
{"text":"I was bummed that my large party couldn't secure the upstairs lounge area (they already had a booking there), but Lauren and Caitlin were both so superb to us.  They found us a large table in the back for our group in record time and keep the food and drinks coming.  Love, love, love their martini selection and live music was an added bonus to the evening."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening for cocktails. I ordered a gin martini, it was delicious. For a snack we ordered pan seared scallops in a strawberry basil sauce. We were so surprised when the huge sea scallops were put in front of us! They were cooked perfectly and the sauce was bright and fresh, and for only $12!   The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because of the atmosphere. This place is set up weird, and there were only 2 or 3 full tables in the \"dining room\". The crowd was full of 40 somethings and there was a cover band, playing all the hits from the 70's and 80's. We didn't stay long."}
{"text":"My review for Olive or Twist is strictly for the bar.  I had my first Moscow Mule there last night and it was absolutely delicious. The bartenders were pouring heavy, and we received quick and friendly service.  They have about 10 beers on tap, mostly craft beer, though they didn't have any porters or stouts.   The specials on their food menu sounded good and the food I saw come out of the kitchen looked pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years and it definitely won't be long before we go back. My soup and sandwich were perfect and so delicious and my husbands burger had to have been good because it was gone before I had a bite. Buff chick dip appetizer was on point too and apparently it was happy hour because it was half off!  It was kind of spicy (to me bc I'm a wimp...husb said not spicy) so I sucked my water down pretty quick and had to resort to some ice chewing until it was refilled, but it was pretty busy for just a couple servers. Staff was super nice even with being so busy.  Only giving 4 stars not 5 because we actually tried going here around 10p a couple weeks ago and the bartender that told us the kitchen was closed was pretty rude about it."}
{"text":"I rate this 5 stars for martinis and lounge, but it's only a 4 for me because the food was average.  I went here with a group of friends for a birthday, The fiance and I had dinner downstairs first and then went upstairs to the lounge.  If you are with a group, it's a pretty fun and chill place and they were playing good danceable music, which my friends and I liked.  It didn't seem that packed for a saturday, so it was easy to get a drink.  I think there's also servers walking around the lounge to take orders, so another plus.  The dining area was pretty small, but we made a reservation just about 2 hours prior to arriving, and we didn't have to wait. My fiance and I shared the calamari, which was really delicious!  Usually, the calamari we get is seasoned with just salt & pepper with maybe some breading at times and chilli and scallions, but this one was a different taste and it was tasty!  It seemed a little asian inspired kind of like sweet with some crumble and salty with soy.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad.  I liked the taste, but it isn't the best ahi to me.  Fish didn't taste that fresh to me.  My fiance had the braised short rib with the mashed potatoes and he said it was only 3 stars for him. He got his friend a turkey wrap and he said it was average.   The real highlight for us were the martinis!  I am not one for martinis but after tasting sweet/bakery inspired martinis, I am feening for it. LOL.  I had the cake batter martini and the chocolate covered pretzel.  Sooo good! They got really creative here with the martinis and the presentation.  Definitely 5 stars for the martini bar :)  Will go back to taste the rest!"}
{"text":"Happy hour specials are $1 off drafts and half-priced appetizers. Try the calamari, it's got a funky sauce but really tasty.  Olive or Twist is usually really crowded for HH on Fridays, which is when my work crew usually rolls in.  I've only been here once during a non-friday HH, and it was much more enjoyable.  The food has been hit-or-miss, but I have generally been impressed with the apps.    I gave this place three stars because of several things.  I've tried a lot of beers here, but I often get them with a glass of 'funk.'  They need to clean their lines more often to get rid of that taste, and drop the price a bit; this is Pittsburgh, not Boston.  Martinis have been hit-or-miss; they've done an excellent job on the dirty Ketel One, but some of the girls have gotten foo-foo drinks that have been undrinkable."}
{"text":"I went to olive or twist after my graduation, so we arrived somewhat late in the evening.  As the name suggests, they are known for their martinis.  With about 2 dozen on the menu, it was hard to choose which one to get, but I went with el jardin and then the dark knight.  Both were delicious (and actually my first two martinis).  We all passed around our martinis and each one was better than the last.  For food, we started with the nachos and calamari.  The nachos were nothing to write home about (pun intended), but the calamari was more than just fried.  It had a sweet glaze on it that tasted almost like maple syrup, but not that sweet.  Really delicious and an interesting take on an appetizer that is usually just fried and served.  For the entrée, I got the delmonico steak.  It was tasty, but not hot when it was served.  In fact, my grandfather got the same thing and he asked them to heat his up and it came back exactly the same.  The server was very polite and made it clear that he told the chef to heat it up, but i don't how on earth a chef can get that feedback and send out the same exact thing.  After a second time of asking to heat it up, it finally was hot when served.  All in all it was an interesting restaurant and definitely a good place for a drink or two if your downtown in the area."}
{"text":"Of all the bars in the Cultural District this one is just average. It's definitely above average on the nights that local singer Katie Simone is performing but other than that I can take it or leave it. They get busy during theatre and sports events and the crowd seems to primarily be suburbanites and yinzers."}
{"text":"The twist is that this place has much more to offer than just drinks!  The ambiance is great for either a happy hour, pre-performance drink/dinner or night out.  There's a small restaurant set up downstairs and then upstairs has a really hip lounge feel.  The tomato bisque is beyond amazing and the desserts are decadent.  But since they have it in the name, the martini list is fantastic, not to mention tastes great!"}
{"text":"Olive and Twist is a convenient and rather nice bar to visit if you're staying in the downtown area.  The huge beer list and so so martinis do their job well in attracting the suits and theater crowds in mass numbers.  Finding a seat can be a chore if you come at the wrong hour because no one ever leaves!  The food menu is your typical bar menu and is very well priced.  My party only got the nachos which were good.  Our bartender, Rosie, was a sweetie and really made us feel welcomed in this steely town."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday before the Pirates game with a few friends.  I have also been here a few times upstairs.  I really liked the fact that we had no problem getting a seat at the bar or a table.  I usually go to the bars on the North Shore prior to Pirates game, but this was a lot less crowded and good for the group I was with.  In fact, truth be told the place was only about 1/2 full (on Bucs opening day!?).  The food was okay.  I tried these nachos which were good and interesting because it had a decent quality sausage as the meat and not just ground beef.  I also really liked the sweet potato fries.  They were delicious and you usually can't get these at too many places.  I ordered the lobster roll.  It was a ton of lobster, however some of the lobster was a little overcooked and it was ice cold.  I can understand serving cool even though Id prefer warm, but ice cold really wasn't that good when they put warm butter on it.  I also tried the tortilla soup, which was really rich and had a good spicy flavor.  The only thing missing in the tortilla soup was the tortilla chips.  A minor oversight I imagine.  Overall, a pretty decent place when you are looking to just have a few beers with friends.  I've also tried the upstairs bar which is the more upscale section.  The bar is huge which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of seating including leather couches.  The happy hour is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 PM.  Overall a decent place for quiet drinks without the crowds and a little better than average food."}
{"text":"Literally the best meal I've ever eaten great salads w homemade croutons and dressings that are to die for. Tried 3 different martinis all were good but the cookie dough martini is flawless hands down best martini ibe ever had and we love martinis!! The lobster Mac and cheese was perfect along w our service! I'd give it ten stars if I could"}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh and after having dinner we headed to Olive or Twist to have a drink.  This was our first time there.  We sat at the bar which was definitely comfortable and the entire place had a relaxing atmosphere.  Since they have a large selection of martinis and other mixed drinks, we each tried a martini.  Who knew the drinks would be so good!  Well, one turned in to a few!  These cocktails were some of the best we've had in years...well balanced, clean, and refreshing.  Not only can Lindsay make really good drinks,  but she was able to suggest drinks when we gave her our tastes, and she enjoyable to talk to.  Next time we are visiting Pittsburgh we'll be going back...and have some food with the great drinks.  But, beware:  when you go there you may end up being responsible for the entry door...a small task we'll be happy to do."}
{"text":"My husband and I selected Olive or Twist for our intimate wedding reception of 85 guests. We could not be happier with our choice, and our guests raved about the food, beverages, service and ambiance. Several described it as the \"most hip\" wedding reception they had attended.  We reserved the entire second floor for our event, and the space was perfect. There was enough seating that no one seemed to be without an option, and the setup was cozy and intimate. Our families were able to sit in medium to large groups together, with smaller high tops for two available as well. The VIP area was used for food setup. We did not need to provide decorations - the atmosphere is already perfect and the tables really do not allow for much additional adornment.  There was enough space to allow for dancing, and ample space for coats. The back bar was used for our dessert/cookies and they added a table at the entrance for our gifts, cards, and guest book.  We chose a variety of cold/hot appetizers and penne pasta, sliders, and truffle fries as our main dishes. Everything was served on small plates. The food was incredible, and the wait staff were attentive and abundant. There was a great selection of draft and bottled beer, and numerous martini options within our price range. We selected the S'mores Martini as our signature drink (we love to camp) and it was very well-received. The General Manager, Brandon, was so responsive and incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. We were able to plan the entire event via email which was super convenient. When I selected certain menu items that he did not feel would be the best options, he pointed me in the direction of others (without inflating our bill). The portioning was right on and there were no surprises at the end of the evening.  If you are looking to host a non-traditional wedding reception (we did not have a DJ - we brought our own iPod) and are ok with unassigned seating and a more relaxed cocktail party feel, this is a perfect choice - especially for smaller receptions. Most other options in the city came with food and beverage minimums that would not have been achievable with our small number of guests.  We are so happy we decided on Olive or Twist for our wedding and would do it again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"A beautiful little bar with an exciting \"martini\" list - do step outside your comfort zone and try one of the crafted drinks."}
{"text":"Olive or Twist, a narrow bar tucked away in the Cultural District, has friendly service, reasonable prices, and pretty decent bar food.  While it's not a sports bar per se, it's a great place to watch a game... like Game 7 of the Stanley Cup.  Go Pens!!  If they renovated their bathrooms, they would definitely deserve a five-star rating."}
