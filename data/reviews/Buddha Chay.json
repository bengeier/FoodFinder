{"text":"Great food with great price. You won't feel you are paying premium for vegetarian food"}
{"text":"Awesome vegetarian food. Live in the area and tried this place for the first time. I like meat A LOT but this place is fantastic and even if you are not a vegetarian you will love it.  Amazing fresh rolls awesome noodles."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little area... very hard to find but definitely a hidden gem!!! The soup noodles are amazing! Everytime I'm  in the are I would stop by for lunch. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 10 stars in a review, because clearly 5 is not enough.  This place is unreal. I probably had the most amazing vegetarian meal of my life. Let me start by saying that I am not a vegetarian at all  as I do consume some meats, but I truly enjoy good quality vegetarian meals. Buddha Chay delivers exceptional food that makes a non vegetarian consider becoming vegetarian. We had excellent service and tried a few different dishes and simply loved each of them. Buddha Chay will be a place I will visit on a regular basis now, and I encourage you to give it a try."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Cute/homey/clean looking restaurant, awesome food, great service (server explained items on the menu, made recommendations and made us feel very comfortable) and unbelievable value! We are not vegetarians, but try to eat meatless meals a few times a week, and this place was a great find! Everything we tried was delicious and we didn't miss meat at all. We plan to be back often and recommend to all our friends."}
{"text":"True authentic Vietnamese vegetarian dishes that you can try here. My favorite is the Bun Bo Hue \"Hue style vermicelli\". Great foods, great prices & quality!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian. But this place is amazing. The owner is super super nice. Food was super affordable. It was tasty. For some dishes - there was mock Vietnamese sausage and my brother and I were so confused if it was real meat or not.  We had the banh mi sandwich. So fresh and tasty.  The noodles. The vermicelli. The fried rice.  All was amazing.  All was affordable!  Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Really great vegetarian vietnamese food. Their bahn mi is only $2.50 and it's absolutely amazing! The spring rolls are one of the best I've ever tried. They are really friendly as well. Can't wait to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"I love this place. food is amazing for vegetarian food. I did not expect vegetarian food to be so good!  FOOD: excellent taste. I go out of my way to come back here. The food is amazing, I have tried everything on the menu and love each and every dish.  ENVIRONMENT: clean. Very true to their name. Buddha because there's a little prayer area.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: Peter and his staff are amazing. They make you feel welcomed. And make you feel like family  OVERALL: LOVE this place and for sure would recommend this place. Like I said I go out of my way to go here and food is amazing."}
{"text":"Went for the 1st time earlier in the week for takeout - LOVED IT:) The service was friendly and fast and the food was packaged well.  FOOD  I got the pho, wonton soup and fresh rolls. Loved the fresh veggies and the variety of imitation meats. Broth is delicious as well:) The portions are quite big - but the noodles are great as leftovers!  Will defiantly be back! :)"}
{"text":"I will definitely return to try everything on the menu. Ordered for dining in:  - #14 VEGETARIAN VIETNAMESE UDON NOODLE SOUP - #12 VEGETARIAN SPRING ROLLS & SHREDDED MOCK MEAT VERMICELLI - #01 VEGETARIAN SPRING ROLLS - #02 VEGETARIAN FRESH ROLLS - #W01 VEGETARIAN DEEP FRIED WONTONS Ordered for take out: - #05 VEGETARIAN PHO - #11 VEGETARIAN HUE STYLE THICK VERMICELLI NOODLE SOUP  Everyone loved their food. A non-vegetarian ate the pho and really enjoyed it. The broth for each dish were flavourful and unique. They used fresh Vietnamese udon which is exceptionally rare. So many places use the cheap grocery store instant udon which is inferior in every possible way. The #02 fresh roll and #12 vermicelli with spring rolls and shredded mock meat was lacking in herbs. Service is typical of most Asian restaurants. Order what you want and ask for anything else when they bring it out otherwise you won't see them. This is likely because the boy who was serving was also doing kitchen work so It's not his fault at all."}
{"text":"The pho blew me away. I am a former meat pho lover, and was shocked at how the taste was  so comparable to meat pho. The mock meats were especially good, the \"tripe\" was of good, firm texture. Then there was this half moon slice that was so flavorful! Ordered crispy wonton, spring rolls, and the crepe. Crepe was huge! Needless to say, I loved the food. :)"}
{"text":"I have been at Buddha 2 weeks ago (sorry it took me a while to post this) but I still have the flavors, freshness and wonderfully presented food. more over they DON'T USE MSG AT ALL. I was very impressed by the taste and the unique (and also different) recipes and combination that you usually see in all vegan restaurants. Then I had the pleasure to meet Peter, the owner/founder of this amazing place, I saw him going table by table to check out all guests and food, something rare in Toronto. So I decided to introduce my self telling him about this super experience and he was so friendly and exited on telling us about his story. I promised him this well deserved review and I invite you guyS to go and try his cuisine. Not just as vegan/vegetarians but for a blast of flavors and originality. amazing food and under rated price. Very honest and I can't wait to back agai.n"}
{"text":"fairly decent vegan food, but a little bland. closing at 8pm is bizarre, who closes their restaurant in the middle of the dinner rush? their hours seem like they cater to old folks who eat dinner st 4:30pm, honestly their hours make no sense.  That aside, the food was decent, but not great, there seems to be a lacking of flavour in their meals especially comparing it to other vietnamese places. This place is in the middle of nowhere and out there, so maybe thats why their hours are so bad. either way. it;s a clean place, with very friendly and helpful staff, so dining there is a ok experience, i just wish the food was great and not just average."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise to come across! The prices were cheap, the staff were friendly and the food was delicious! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic vegetarian Viet food! I had the Bun Bo Hue, spring rolls, pancakes and ice coffee. All exceptional but my favorites were the BBH and ice coffee! Would come again!"}
{"text":"Who knew vegetarian pho would taste so good. Definitely a place to try when you are sick of meat."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad.  Now, I'm not a vegetarian but I appreciate all things food. With that being said, my opinion is based off what I enjoy eating and I can't say I have much to compare to as I've only experienced a few different vegetarian restaurants thus far. I really liked the idea of a vegetarian noodle soup joint as I know those who once had pho definitely missed this dish once they decided to become a vegetarian.  I pretty much ordered your basic noodle soup with vermicelli and a few toppings. The broth was delicious. Much lighter than the beef broth I'm used to obviously but still had some good flavours. I enjoyed some of the \"meats\" that were in it but not all. I was also informed by a staff member that they do not use garlic or onion in their noodle dishes. Instead, they use fried leek. Most Buddhists do not/cannot consume these items so it's nice that they have accommodated this as well.  The staff was very friendly and informative whenever we had any questions. One staff member actually have our table a sample of their wontons and boy were they delicious! The texture was similar to that of meat and it was packed with flavour fried in a wonton. I didn't need any dip. The staff member also added that he makes these wontons fresh, made to order. Yum!  This place was tucked away behind a pizza joint and had very limited parking spaces (like 4), but there's street parking on a side street right by it for convenience."}
{"text":"Most pho places offer vegan options which replaces meat with tofu or veggies. Not many places uses delicious mock meats like this one. Approved by vegans and non-vegans.  Bowls come in one size. Very refreshing. Generous portions for the price ($8).   I also love their fresh rolls and the dipping sauce they come with. Very delicious and I strongly recommend them.  Service is very friendly. Prices are very affordable. This is by far the best pho I ever had. I drove 30 minutes here. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is kinda of hidden because the actual restaurant is recessed between 2 other buildings.  For a vegetarian Viet restaurant it is very good. Service is friendly, and the bun hue and the banh canh (soup noodle) dishes we had were very flavourful. I don't know how they made that good of brother without using meat. The Viet sub we tried was just okay."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever had!!!! Especially vegan pho! And great prices as well! Just bring cash."}
{"text":"One of the biggest problems with eating a plant based diet is that restaurants and society consider it a \"hassle\" and charge you a premium for eating healthy foods. Usually vegan and vegetarian places charge you more than a place that serves meat (which makes no sense to me, but I digress), but you won't have any problems here.  I believe almost all the dishes were under $10.  I ordered the fried rice and fresh veggie rolls.  The fresh veggie rolls were different. Most places have tofu, lettuce and a few sprouts.  In this case, it appeared it was lettuce and some type of mock meat.  Tasted okay without the peanut sauce, but with the peanut sauce, it was absolutely delicious.    I also ordered the veggie fried rice. Huge portion and very tasty.  Would order it again.  I think it was $8 or $9.  Could have served two. I ate the entire thing.    In terms of decor/ambiance - the neighbourhood isn't the best and the parking is limited, but the inside is very clean and nicely decorated.  Service was also wonderful.  The owner was super friendly.  The only downside is that it is cash only.  Verdict: If I'm in the area, I'd definitely visit again for some good affordable Asian vegan food with no msg."}
{"text":"Finally got to visit this lunch spot close to my work last week!   A few of us stopped in to basically order the whole menu. Don't go hangry lol  Suggested Bun Bo Hue (spicy noodle soup) and Rice with shredded pork to my Co workers. We also got the spring rolls, fried wonton and bun xeo (crepe) as appetizers.    I ordered the bun  (cold mixed noodles with spring rolls) but they forgot about it so grabbed it for take out with their Bahn mi (sub) and a container from the hot table instead.   Friendly service with clean and spacious dining room. Parking isn't the best but there are a few spots for free!  Will be back for sure. My friend slurped up all the soup!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem on Yelp (thank you!!) when passing through the neighbourhood.   Really loved this cute place offering super tasty and lovingly prepared Vietnamese vegetarian/vegan food.  We ordered mushroom wontons, fresh rolls, banh mi, crispy fried noodles, fresh lime soda, and an iced coffee to share for a late lunch. Everything tasted super fresh and bright, loved loved their food! Love the homemade hot sauce on the tables.  Bae is a carnivorous dude but said he really enjoyed the food here and would return. Even if you a meat eater, try this place! You might be surprised :)  Want to come back to try their pho and other noodle dishes!!  Of note : parking here may be tricky, there are only a few small spots in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Vegetarian delight. Hole in the wall place but very welcoming and it's got positive vibes as soon as you enter. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Another great experience at this restaurant!   They are now serving cold tea instead of hot tea now that the weather has warmed up, which I appreciate.  Had #12 which is a vermicelli noodle dish that comes with 3 spring rolls, pickled carrots and daikon, shredded lettuce, soy mock meat, seasoned glass noodles, and crushed peanuts on top. Served with nuoc mam of course.  The spring rolls were very tasty plus nice and crispy. The noodles and veggies tasted fresh. Only complaint is that the dish could use more mock meat - it was a little stingy on serving size.  As always, this is a great place to have a fresh, tasty, and affordable meal! (With friendly service)"}
{"text":"Just went to this restaurant a few days ago with the family   We used to go at least once a week.  I think it has made its money.  The quality has gone way down hill.  We had the fried rice-----it was very clumpy; bearly has any taste and ordered the won tong noodle soup----the fried won tong were soggy and bearly warm.  Half the time there was no wait staff anywhere.  They were all hiding in the kitchen.  I didn't see Peter anywhere.  Maybe a change of ownership"}
{"text":"Such a nice restaurant. A little expensive but u have good quality food with great service"}
{"text":"All the wonderful dishes but made in a vegetarian way. Been here 3x with friends and standards are always maintained. Service is quick and the head Chef is friendly and funny!   Highly recommend for vegetarians looking for authentic Vietnamese cuisine with no compromise on taste"}
{"text":"Lovely place came here to get some vegan pho with friend. Will have to say best vegan pho ever. I ordered the spicy one #11 and it was great loved the place the owner is so friendly and cool.   The server is very nice and quick in bringing the food. So fast and tasty will definitely come back to get some more spicy pho."}
{"text":"Parking: Free on certain hours on the side road (which is where I recommend parking on busy days). There's parking at the restaurant itself but the parking lot is weird. If you park there you car may get blocked by other vehicles leaving you unable to get out, I only recommend parking here on not-so-busy days.  Washrooms: Relatively clean.  Experience/Venue: Small joint, they have 3 booths along the wall (which usually seats 4 people per booth) and some tables in the middle big enough to bring larger groups of say 10?  Food: I always grab the bun mi sandwich, and they usually sell out. The Pho is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Great place good food very clean great customer service would recommend it to anybody"}
{"text":"I come here about 2-3 days a week for lunch and the food is great. Owner is super friendly and accommodating. The food is also fairly healthy compared to other options in the area. Highly recommend giving it a shot!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The restaurant itself is charming, clean and modern. The food is wonderful, lovingly cooked, and large portioned. Virtually all menu items are vegan. The owner is a very nice, outgoing young man who will gladly discuss the food with you. It's a must go place. Please go and support their great efforts."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better to best vegetarian places to eat, even for non vegetarians. The taste was very flavourful and every option seemed to turn out well.   The bahn mi was delish and the spicy soup noodle was awesome. Everything was reasonably priced.   The parking is a little tricky and double parked but people will move for you. Also a little hard to find, it's in between two buildings and easily missed."}
{"text":"Amazing Vegan Friendly Restaurant.  Great taste and portions. Prices? Outstanding.   We order every type of dish and was impressed with everyone.   Inside very modern and plenty of parking spaces.   Their vegan friendly Vietnamese buns just blew our expectations.   Just remember, their whole menu is vegan friendly with no egg or dairy even their fish sauce for their Pho Noodle Soup is vegan fish sauce!!!!! OMG!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The owner was extremely friendly and welcoming as we walked in. He told us about the menu and took into consideration the food allergies of our group. As we waited for our food, he offered us piping hot tea on the house- especially comforting on a cold, windy Toronto day!  The food. The food was WOW. We all got the classic pho and the portions were extremely generous. The broth is unlike any other vegan broth you've had in pho before- it's extremely rich, flavourful, and pairs wonderfully with the fresh noodles and bean sprouts. The mock meats are delicious but are not even necessary, since the broth and noodles are so good!   I will definitely return, probably once a week (since I live nearby) and try everything on the menu! The prices are really fair ($8 per pho, tax included). An honest, good food and good people kind of place."}
{"text":"I can't believe it is not ___________. Fill in the blank with anything on Buddha Chay's menu.   Buddha Chay is not your typical Vietnamese restaurant. It is a vegetarian (vegan) establishment off Highway 400. Inside the bright modern restaurant, is a serene wall filled with delicate white lotus flowers and artistic Vietnamese calligraphy. Food at Buddha Chay's is made from pure love. It is the owner and chef, Peter Thai's long time dream to have a restaurant he can call his own.   My companions and I visited Buddha Chay for a dinner party. We were floored by not only the authenticity of the food, but also at how closely it simulates the flavour profile of meat-based Vietnamese restaurants. Throughout our meal, you can hear everyone at the table echoing the same thoughts - \"this is so good! I can't believe it is not ___________.\"   For starters, we placed orders of Goi Cuon Chay (fresh spring rolls, $4), Cha Gio Chay (deep fried spring rolls, $4) and deep fried wontons. The appetizers were respectable. I was especially impressed by the vegan fish sauce. It is hard to believe there is no fermented fish in the sauce!   For main, I listened to my Vietnamese friend (a.k.a. Pho Guru)'s recommendation and ordered her favourite Bun Hue Chay (Vegetarian Hue Style Vermicelli, $7). It was the best pho I have had in a long time. The Pho God is finally blessed me after a long hiatus of sub-par pho. Bun Hue Chay is the perfect winter abundance bowl! The vibrant herbs and vegetables garnishes were exceptionally fresh. The complex broth is perfectly spiced with aromatics.  It was an interplay of flavours; a fine balance between fat, sweet, savoury, sour and umami! Each time I dug into the bowl, I discovered new ingredients - oyster mushrooms, mock beef, mock sausage, fried tofu and other UFOs (unidentified foreign objects...in a good way).   Buddha Chay's food speaks to the soul.   Pro tip: Taste the broth first and savor its complexity before adding garnishes!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian restaurant with a lot of great variety. The dishes are delicious and really worth it for anyone to try it! I quite like the place mainly because it's in a part of town that most vegans and vegetarians wouldn't think to visit, and offers some thing new and unique for the neighborhood. Always grab the banh mi which is only $3 and has great quality. Every item has its charm and the owner (I think his name is Peter Quill) is really great; very kind and passionate about vegan food."}
