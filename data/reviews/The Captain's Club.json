{"text":"Captain's club \"use to be amazing\" until the original owner sold it since then it went down hill  been there 4 times since it change owners and it's not the same. Menu has changed, service is awful, I could go on and on. The new owners must of never heard the term \"if it an broke don't fix it\""}
{"text":"Been here several times, drinks are great, the spinach dip is literally the best I have ever had and they make that into a pizza as well, get yourself one, trust me! Oh and the \"big boy\" style burger is stupid good, fries are off the chain. Sevice is hit or miss, but never bad. Me and the old man love to hit this spot for a browns game, good food, football and drinking faces off :)"}
{"text":"The Captain's Club is a  friendly sports bar/restaurant in Eastlake. Very, very good pizza (8 slices for $8.75) .  Spinach and artichoke dip was missing artichokes and was alright. Would not order a salad there again. Dressing was Wishbone and Hidden Valley Ranch.  Laid back environment.  Would definitely go back for the pizza.  People also seemed to like their chicken wings (several varieties to choose from)."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 5:30 PM on Sunday and ate there with my family in a party of six. Food was delicious! service was terrific but we were not told they close at six so we were the only ones in there for most of our meal! Therefore we didn't see the real captains club as we were told it would be! We will certainly try it again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch when I am visiting the Eastlake area. The food is always good as is the service. I usually stick with my my same selection, the Chicken Caesar Wrap. I love the dressing on this wrap and the sweet potato fries are out of this world.The Captain's Club also has a great selection of beer."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  On Friday, the clam chowder is exceptional.  We go there a lot for long island ice teas and appetizers.  The potato skins and peperoni rolls are great.  They have a full menu that would appeal to most anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for lunch. We ordered a ceasar salad. There was no hard boiled egg, no fresh shredded asiago cheese or fresh Parmesan . I must add the dressing is from a bottle. Our server was very rude and talk to the mod right next next to us. We were told we were \" this is how we do it\"  mod was very unprofessional.  Not going back with the current owners in place. Miss nick and nickie"}
{"text":"This place is a great location to stop in if you are heading to a Captain's game. With the outdoor seating I really enjoy throwing a few drinks back before we go to a game. The food is typical bar food and since that is what most people enjoy I see nothing wrong with grabbing some wings or a burger, etc. nothing stands out to me about the food or drinks but it is the outdoor seating that gets me to stop so I am more of a warm season customer when I am in the area. If you are heading to a game make this a stop before you go and you may never make it across the street for the game!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and have nothing but good things to say. Wings are fantastic, beer is cold and service is great. Looking forward to trying the breakfast food on the weekends if i can get up early enough!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here Sunday to meet friends and grab a bite. Took a little time to get drinks and menus to begin our experience. I ordered the black bean burger $9 it came out paper thin and so so small on a huge bun 5 times thicker then the pattie along with a tomato and piece of lettuce this burger was a frozen store bought item . I wish the new owner the best i know it is a rough business but for $9 have a person in the kitchen with talent to make them or price better i can get four of those little paper thin bean patties at Aldi's for $3.00 and they look as thou thats where they came from. Sons wings where typical. Very clean and cozy now to make your food stand out.."}
{"text":"Nice layout waitress was nice bar was clean and we'll organized drunks we a little strong but I ordered a hamburger the burger was good but the bun they put it on was horrible it was the wrong size and style for the burger it made for a messy burger. When the manager came and asked how everything was I asked if thee was alternative bun choices and he rudely said no and as he walked away he said everyone's an expert"}
{"text":"Based on reviews, decided to try the wings and fries.  The fresh cut fries were excellent.  The wings were very large, meaty wings but I would describe them as \"cringeworthy\".   The skins were rubbery and no crispiness to them at all.  Crisp skin is a vital part of a good wing.  Service was very good.  I may try this place again but not willing to risk the wings."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and have enjoyed wing night.  My son and husband came pretty regular.  First night I got a garlic Parm boneless wings,  and they were really good.  The next time,  they were OK,  but not consistent with my first experience..  Nor has any experience after that.  We had sworn off wing night.  Tonight I convinced the family to try one more time,  and I was very disappointed.  I ordered the garlic parm boneless again,  and I received a basket of breaded wings,  and on the bottom of the tray was a puddle of flavorless greasy butter with some a sprinkle of parm cheese.  Blah.  My husband got the  BBQ which used to be saucy with a smokey tang.  Not today,  very little bbq sauce with dry spots. I dealt with it thinking this is truly the last time we are coming.  My son ordered French onion soup which he did enjoy.  At the end of our meal,  my son asked for a piece of Banana foster cheese cake.  We were made aware they have a new owner and that was no longer available but they had a brownie dessert.  He was satisfied with that.  The wait staff is always great..  Food was just disappointing and we will truly not be back.  Unsure if it has to do withbth  new owner,  if they are having issues with the  cook,  or what the deal is...  I gave them another shot and convinced my family to as well,  and I was wrong... If I was able to just rate the service,  I would have rated them a five.."}
{"text":"I had the rare opportunity to be back in Ohio and visit with my closest friends and their wives for an evening. We planned on a minor league baseball game in the neighborhood and, not surprisingly, it was rained out. So we drifted over to The Captain's Club, a sports bar and restaurant across the street.   It was a great spot for our intentions-  casual, affordable and friendly. It has a great selection of grill/sports bar food with a couple of specialties as well. So we parked it and enjoyed the night.   The crowd was light and we seated ourselves before much of the rained-out fans drifted in. Within easy view were several HDs with a good mix of sporting events as well as live Keno. I lost a few $$ while supporting Ohio education. And we were able to view the rare occurrence of an Indians victory.   I started, as usual, with a Guinness. I was disappointed. It was a bit light and not prepared to my picky expectations. It was poured no differently than any other beer on tap which is not a proper presentation for it's special status. Since it wasn't up to par, I switched to a domestic.   I liked the variety of the menu and found a few selections that I probably would have enjoyed. I settled on the fish sandwich with fries.   It turned out to be a popular choice at the table. One of their specialties is the Big Boy Burger- a double stack reminiscent of the original Manner's Big Boy sandwich of my youth. It was more popular than the fish.   As typical sports bar items go, the fish was above average in size and flavor and by all accounts the Big Boy far exceeded average. The fries were thin, skin on and tender. They were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Service was attentive and friendly. Our bartender/server, Joe, was always on the spot and we never had to call or go to the bar. Great guy.  The Captain's Club was just the right atmosphere for our casual group and provided everything in just the right measure on a rainy Ohio night."}
{"text":"Holy geez where did this place come from? We stopped in there on a Sunday morning because we heard that they had.. Now the only thing I can think of on a Sunday morning at a bar is nothing but maybe wet smelly carpets and leftover scents from the night before.  You walk in there on a Sunday morning, looks like the place was never even a bar. Our server was also the bartender named Niki. She was super attentive and we had six of us eating. Between the pancakes with sausage the coffee and the pancakes and more pancakes I was super satisfied with this place. Now here is the bonus: the fellow that is in charge of the kitchen and you could tell he was the chef because he was wearing all of the chef style clothing came out and visited every table, shook hands, and was nothing but smiles. You would have thought this guy was running for office. But it was that much cooler that he cared about what you thought about his food and he gets nothing but praise from us. The captains club is a place we will definitely go again for brunch and whatever they're doing they should keep doing it because it is working 100%"}
{"text":"Only problem is that they are not open late. If you try and stay late they run the vacuum to give you the hint they want to go home."}
{"text":"Was at this Sports Bar on Oct 15 for their Grand Re-opening!  Place was packed and food was amazing.  Chicken dip and chips were out of this world delicious. Rueben was stuffed with meat and sauerkraut and was one of the best I have ever had.  Watched the Cleveland Indian game with the crowd. So many Tribe fans and TVs were everywhere you looked.  Couldn't miss a single play!!!  Service was great and owners came around to be sure ALL were satisfied!!!!! A must try.  We will be back on 10/29 to watch the Tribe in the World Series!!!!"}
{"text":"What every sports bar should aspire to be. Some of the best food in the area for bar food. Fantastic soups. And the pizza that could hold their own with anyone. Well run, clean, and comfortable. Surprisingly diverse menu. Game night specials are also a great deal. But saving the best for last, is the breakfast! Only available on Saturday and Sunday, but worth waiting for on the weekend. Nothing like having a gourmet breakfast with a full bar. My kind of place"}
{"text":"Terrible service. First round of drinks came almost instantly after being ordered however after we got out food the second round of drinks we ordered never came and after requesting our check they tried to tell us that they could not split them up because they weren't told before hand. However after we informed her we didn't have cash magically they could split them up. However the second round of drinks was of course on our bill."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you want a quick dinner. Service is so slow. Food is just average."}
{"text":"Ok place.  The beer tasted flat and the servers are nice but slowwwww.  They have Keno..which is fun.  The food is typical..nothing stands out.  Everything tastes like it came on a Sysco truck and heated up.  Mostly an older crowd.  Right across the street from the Captains stadium and its probably the most kid friendly of em.."}
{"text":"our original destination on the nite we stopped here had a near hour wait .. so we decided to give this place a try .. decent fish & chips (we both ordered it) .. fresh cut fries did not disappoint & while I think the fish was frozen it was fried properly & had a good flavor & \"flake\" to the fish .. would return if in the area & needed another pit stop choice"}
{"text":"I really like the layout of this place for watching games and just going for beers.  The location is great for people going to the Captain's game to stop into before or after.  I've tried a few things on the menu and have nothing bad to say.  The facilities serve each need nicely, the restaurant and bar are is pretty clean, waitstaff is nice, slow at times, but I really can't complain.    Given the area, the only place that I prefer to go to when hitting a Captains game is Scorchers (Wing Warehouse) only because I also park there for free.  I'll review them next so I can tell you about the goodies there.  As for Captain's Club, go, grab a bite and a beer, don't be scared.   This was the first place I EVER tried X-mas Ale.  They limited everyone to (2) 20oz drafts, apparently people get really drunk off that stuff......two nights later I found out how drunk.  Yikes."}
{"text":"It's OK.  It was great when it first opened, but has gone downhill.  Our most recent experience wasn't a good one.  We went with another couple, and three of us ordered the pseudo-Big Boy.  The server told us that a group of regulars order it every week and just rave about it -- I guess they've never tasted the original.  The fourth member of our party ordered something she'd had there about a week previously, and mentioned that fact to the server.  The food she received was quite different from what she'd had on her earlier visit, when we went there for lunch, and my friend didn't like it at all.  When she queried the server the young lady very snootily replied that \"the kitchen doesn't do it that way anymore.\"  Well, why didn't she say something in the first place?  No need to go back."}
{"text":"Nicely appointed sports bar across the street from the stadium. We started my birthing day blowout here right after everyone left to go to a game. That meant service was very quick. Summer Shandy on tap flowed freely for myself and the buttery crotch guy. My wife and i had the nachos and onion rings. Standard fare, but nice portions. Mother in law had a salad. Kind of a boomer crowd at the time which conflicted with the high school alt rock and Madonna soundtrack. I received many \"old man\" presents as a result of being over the hill at the tender age of 33. Hemorrhoid cream, a magnifying glass, and a heat patch for my back. Thanks, prospective cm. Hopefully there will be better giveaways when you get the job.  Some buzzed older folks offered our whole party some shots for my birthday. Very  thoughtful and unexpected. Their only advice for us was to support the troops. I started that very second.   Family atmosphere and decent prices. Good for kids."}
{"text":"Wings are great but service was very slow, especially since they weren't busy. We had 7 beers total for $23!!!! Domestic to boot! Took 10 min to get check and another 10+ for server to come back and get it!!"}
{"text":"Place is hidden gem. You have to try the BLT  wrap and order it with fried egg. Appetizers are great including the french onion soup. Give this place a try if your in the area."}
