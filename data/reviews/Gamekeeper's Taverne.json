{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. It's nice without being too stuffy. The food is very well-prepared, the menu has good variety, and the prices are reasonable considering the venue. Wine list is very good. And the service has always been good (and fun) for me.
Parking is a little tough on Fri/Sat tho. If there's a wait I'll leave my name with the Hostess and go next door to Blakes for a drink. They've got a really nice bar.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Other than the company, not one aspect of this meal/experience was satisfying. Our 8.00p reserved table wasn't available until 8.25p. Although our server was nice, our service was inattentive. A too-loud musician was playing songs and singing quite badly (think Paul Simon songs without any melodic sense). But most of all, the problem is that except for the salads, all of the food -- literally every plate -- was either atrocious or tasteless. The beet and the poached pear salads were good; the balsamic dressing on the pear salad went well with the sweetness of the pears but it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, and the nuts accompanying the beets were also good. But the calimari was much too salty; the meatballs were like tasteless cardboard balls, with something worrisome going on with the ricotta (and the balls didn't have any gamy qualities); the polenta cake was bland, soggy, and so salty I wondered whether it was accidentally dropped on a salted plate before it was served to us; the gazpacho weirdly had pieces of celery in it for no discernible reason; the pheasant appetizer tasted like twice-re-microwaved old general tzo's chicken from a cheap Chinese restaurant; and the filet mignon and short rib had pretty decent texture but no taste whatsoever. (The short rib, unfortunately, looked like it was vomited onto the plate -- definitely a bad plating decision).

At least the weather was nice so we got to eat outside. Don't think everything about this restaurant was bad: the water, wine, and bread were all good."}
{"text":"Apparently Joeys had burned down, so we tried this place.  A bit pretentious all around.  My medium meat was well done, in both cooking time and salt content.  Tomato bisque soup was consistency of paste.  Service was genuinely disingenuous.  Stay home, have a Hot Pocket.  At least it'll be hot and tasty."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner. One of us is disabled. The place is a booby trap for anyone who has difficulty walking. The restrooms and especially men's room is just about inaccessible. You have to go upstairs then turn and go up an extremely high step 
Plus it was very dirty. I don't know how they get around being ADA  compliant but this place is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Food is just ok and service not exactly attentive. On e steak ordered to be med well was so bloody it had to be sent back and returned still bloody.  No one told us you could have a validation for valet parking if you asked your waitress so had to pay for parking. The list of faux pas is endless. Will
Not go again."}
{"text":"Braved a snowy night. They took great care of us and had a wonderful seat by the fire.
Great atmosphere.  Had the Clam chowder and spinach salad, both good.  Sauce on the Chicken marsala was the best I've had in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Beautifully prepared food. Great atmosphere outside. Fun with a group or just the two of you. The salad with pears and warm, crusted gorgonzola cheese is magnificant. I saw it served at every other table when we were there last.  

If all the tables are full, you can sit at the outside bar and order food or wait for a table.  Inside, it's a little stuffy."}
{"text":"Made reservations for lunch by phone. They did not have them. We each ordered clam chowder, I had a salad and friend had fried green tomatoes. The soup was cold but had good flavor and the salad was tasteless. The coffee was just luke warm. The waitress was not very interested in us or the fact the food wasn't very good. So disappointed."}
{"text":"The wait was pretty bad. Drinks were \"eh\" and we had to literally grab the wait staff to order more drinks. Left for Jekyll's across the road and had a much better time."}
{"text":"Very disappointing 33rd anniversary celebration at gamekeepers. Poor reservation execution. Told at the time of reservation that it was our 33rd and we would like a table by the fireplace or at least a nice table. Ended up in a booth in the cold noisy hallway with the coats. Hostess was not helpful nor interested in our dilemma. Would advise care before entrusting these folks with your special event."}
{"text":"I think the benefit to this place is the outdoor patio which seems to be a common theme based on the wait on a beautiful summer Saturday night. Luckily they have 2 separate hostesses and reservation lists to manage inside vs outside. We had to wait a little longer than the given time, but then again we didn't have reservations.

Food was tasty and well-prepared, but I don't know if I would consider the food a main draw."}
{"text":"My husband and I hadn't been to Gamekeeper's in a few years since on the last visit instead of going home with a doggie bag I went home with a monstrous case of food poisoning.  But friends of ours wanted to go so...  We arrived about 7:15 and the hostess told us since we didn't have reservations it would be about a 45 minute wait.  At about 20 after 8 I went to the hostess to ask how much longer she thought it would be since we could see empty tables above the bar and in other parts of the dining room.  And she says, \" Oh, I can seat you right now.\"  I assume if I hadn't asked we'd still be waiting.  So, we finally order dinner.  My salad comes but there is no bread for the table because they're out for now but baking more.  Not a major problem but surprising for this level of restaurant.  My filet is done as ordered but the potatoes that come with it are horrible.  They're supposed to be an au gratin or scalloped potato but are thinly sliced potatoes with RAW onion, lumpy, congealed (American?) cheese and TONS of salt.  My husband's steak is fine but the fingerling potatoes that come with it are nothing special.  Our friend's tilapia is swimming in sauce.  So much sauce that you can hardly find the fish.  The quality of the hamburger and fries that his date had could be found at any fast food restaurant.  All in all, a very disappointing experience and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was a beautiful patio. The blueberry vodka lemonade was so refreshing on a hot summer day! They do a unique twist on the Reuben which features a tomato, bacon relish! It was awesome! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Great ambiance, with abundant fireplaces, old-style feel without the creaky floors or draftiness.

It wasn't terribly busy, and the kitchen was prompt.  The dry-rubbed bison skirt steak with horseradish cream, garlic mashed and bleu cheese/bacon spinach was fantastic.  Perfectly done, and the cheeses complemented the steak, instead of overpowering it.

Also had the crab and artichoke dip, mayo-free, thank goodness, with panko crumb topping.  Delicious, smooth and savory.  No filler added.

Lobster nachos were a bit light on the lobster, but perhaps it was better that way, since the balance of flavors would have made them heavy otherwise.

Kobe beef croustade with lightly pickled radish was a delectable bite, grilled to be succulent and flavorful.

Can't wait to go back.  Wouldn't mind bringing the boyfriend here fofr a romantic getaway.  But then how would I get him to Cleveland?"}
{"text":"Love it!  Great food and a fantastic staff.  Killer reuben sandwich!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to, and I've been to quite a few very good restaurants. 

The building, surrounding area, and the town are all beautiful. They have both inside and outside seating. The food is very good; both in quality and taste. The service is very good as well. 

I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Just had another great meal here...as did everyone else at the large table.  The service has been consistently friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to please...even the high school age hostess was surprisingly professional.  

This restaurant has unique items, namely in the meat dept from Elk to Boar, but abounds with fresh fish items as well.  The Clam Chowder here is among the best I know in Cleveland. It is a permanent menu item.  Don't miss it...and be sure to save some of their warm, fresh bread for dipping...Mmmm.

You will love the decor, cozy and comfortable.  The sound can get a little intense upstairs near the fireplace when this dining area is full, but this is to be expected with all the wood surfaces that create a wonderful sports cabin-like atmosphere.  

Speaking of cabin...Gamekeepers has delightful lodging options as well.  It makes for a nice weekend getaway.   My wife and I have had pleasant stays and love walking around the area, highlighted locally as a romantic destination of cute shops and a special waterfall after which Chagrin Falls is named.  

This place pleases.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"In general, this is the unfriendliest restaurant in Cleveland. I like the food, so I do go back, but I never feel welcome.  I am not one to lightly play the race card, but we are African Americans, and I do have to wonder.  Today is our anniversary, and we decided to go for lunch.  We were told all empty tables were awaiting people who had called ahead for reservations--possibly true.  But I got no response when I asked when a regular table might be free.  We were offered the bare or a high top sitting right up next to the big screen television.  When I responded that we really wanted a table,  my husband is in his seventies and I am in my sixties,  so the high top would not work well.
This brought on thoughts of last year.  We dined at Gamekeepers for dinner on our anniversary.  The service was terrible.  We had dirty silverware twice.  By the time we got the waiter's attention, our hot soup was cold and had to be microwaved.  This was followed by a mediocre meal. 
Today we looked at each other and decided to dine elsewhere.

{"text":"If you like to chew on rubber, then by all means, attend their clambake. The clams will literally bounce off the floor if thrown. Not worth the $200 price tag for meal and drinks for a couple."}
{"text":"It's a real shame to see a good restaurant go downhill like this is. I went to lunch with a friend on a beautiful afternoon. We sat on the patio and it was a good 10 mins before our waitress came over to greet us. I ordered the salmon Caesar salad and it was terrible. The salmon was freezer burnt and tasted fishy and old. The waitress never came back to ask us how things were so we had to flag down the manager. She gave me an \"oh, can I get you something else?\" I said yes! I asked for fresh grilled chicken on the salad instead and it came out the same way, freezer burnt and awful tasting! I had to flag down the manager again and expressed my displeasure. She asked if I'd like to see the menu to order something else, but I was afraid to order anything. My friend then talked me into getting the angel hair pasta with roasted vegetables. It was good, but how can you mess up pasta? While waiting for my food, I had to ask for some bread that was never delivered with either of my salads. The waitress was pleasant, but very slow and never came back to refill our Arnold Palmers or ask if we'd like anything else. When we asked for the check, it was delivered with no apology for the problems and I never received one from the manager either. I won't be recommending or going back! Sorry, but it used to be a fabulous place for lunch and dinner. And we need good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"There are two parts to this review. 

The food itself was faultless. I personally had the elk and it was one of the nicest cuts of meat I've ever had. The others in my party also enjoyed their meals. The wild boss in particular was delicious. 

However, this place was let down by the waiter serving us. He was great throughout the meal but despite this, due to tough fiscal times I had to undertip slightly. After this, the waiter took it upon himself to corner one of our party as they were coming out of the restroom and question the amount of his tip. I've never experienced such unprofessional behaviour in any restaurant I've visited anywhere in the world. It was highly embarrassing and I'll not be visiting again as a result"}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant!  I came for lunch on a Friday afternoon and my date and I shared the southwestern salad and bistro salad.  Both were good and the chicken was very fresh and nicely seasoned.  The service was good too.  My only complaint would be that they stopped serving food at 2:30pm!  Good thing we arrived just before 2!

It's a suburban crowd, and it was really nice to people watch while sitting in the outdoor patio which was quite beautiful.  I can only imagine how nice this place is in the evenings!"}
{"text":"Sadly, the food, presentation and service has gone to the dogs.  We ate there Friday night, party of 5.  It was an hour to an hour and a half for food.  Rarely saw the waitress.  Food was terrible.  The head dude came by and said they had a new menu.  Really, too slow.."}
{"text":"My wife and I had 630 reservations on the patio for a Sunday night.  Perfect outdoor dining weather played a role in a terrific meal.  We started out with the venison meatballs and wedge salad as appetizers.  Though the wedge came without bacon (menu said bacon), it was a good start.
I had the hanger steak, my wife the lobster/boar sausage pasta.  Both were good, the steak a little off though.  I wish I had the guts to try the grilled elk or venison entrees.  
Drink menu is strong, I went with the \"dark n stormy\" cocktail.
Ambiance outside is excellent.  The covered patio as well as the uncovered portion is equally stellar."}
{"text":"Been here many times with my husband but it has probably been about two years since our last visit; I went for a business lunch two weeks ago and was left with a sour taste in my mouth from the server. I understand that with the holidays lunches can be busier than normal but it shouldn't effect service; especially when there are obviously enough staff running around us, and they weren't really that busy to be honest. Food was good enough; nothing to write home about.. I think they may have changed chef since the last time I have visited but can't be sure."}
{"text":"Excellent place to dine!  Great atmosphere and very friendly wait staff.  Their food is very unique and not like anything I have had elsewhere.  I personally had the wedge salad and the Elk.  Both were fantastic!  Yes, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our second date here.  We go back whenever we can.  The food is always soooo good.  This past Saturday, we met some good friends there.  They hadn't been for a long time and remembered how much they had liked it the last time.  We tried some fun and unusual (for us) drinks instead of ordering our usual glasses of wine.  Each one was better than the last.  The restaurant was packed, but didn't feel it.  And yet our server kept a close eye on our table and never looked frazzled by all the filled tables for which she was responsible.  We had a wonderful time catching up, sampling each other's food (we nearly licked the plate clean of the Elk French fries!) and giggling the night away. Atmosphere was cozy and friendly.  A perfect night."}
{"text":"After an afternoon pursuing through Chagrin Falls, the Gamekeepers Taverne was the perfect location to end the day.  I did make reservations in advance and I would suggest these as we arrived about 15 min early and consequently needed to wait in the bar for about 15 min as they were unable to seat early.  The food was exquisite.  We split the antelope skewers for an appetizer and this was the high point of the meal.  This is not to degrade the main courses, but rather a description of the exquisite quality of these skewers.  I will order these every time that I return; they are cooked medium rare to rare and are melt in your mouth good.  The hoisin-based marinate compliments the antelope very well.  For the main course, I had the elk medallions, which were very good and the wild mushrooms provided an excellent complement.  My date had the Wild boar sausage and lobster pasta.  It was very good especially the boar sausage, but the sauce associated with the pasta was rather bland (note that we both like to order Thai hot, so it might be good for the general public).  The service was so-so and I needed to stop the waitress several times to address some issues (initially ordering, another glass of wine, water) as she did not stop very frequently."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for his birthday. Before our reservation, we had a couple drinks at the outdoor patio bar and thought it was one of the nicest patio bars we've been to! Once inside, we ordered lobster spring rolls, which I thought were great, but there were only two rolls. Our entrees were delicious and our server was attentive without being \"pushy\". In addition, he recommended a great, reasonably priced wine. Our only complaint was that we requested a seat by the window when we made a reservation earlier in the week, even confirmed it when they called earlier in the day to clarify where we wanted to sit, and still sat in the middle of the dining room! Overall, a great experience. We plan to visit again and sit outside on the awesome patio!"}
{"text":"I've come here for 25 years....it's definitely \"consistently inconsistent \" ... food  can be good to great....atmosphere is what every small town craves. The service at the bar was....well the bartender was never trained on when and how to clear the plates...I felt like I was at Appleby's. The restaurant feels under managed and it shows in the waitstaff....food was good....but skimpier than in the past."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch on the patio with my good friend Dolly"}
{"text":"This may sound crazy, but I actually hadn't been to Chagrin Falls in about 15 years until last Friday night. I forgot how cute and charming it is. 

A friend and I decided to head to Gamekeeper's because of their great patio. It was a busy summer evening and we had to wait around 20 minutes, wasn't too bad! 

I'd say the ambiance inside and outside are completely different. Outside is more casual and romantic. Inside, more rustic and hunting lodgy.

We both started with a salad. Partner in crime chose the Hydroponic Whole Leaf Caesar Salad. I chose the Crisp Iceberg Lettuce Wedge. Both were as fresh and delicious as could be.

For dinner, neither of us were starving. We decided to share the Wild Game Meatloaf. Only I'm not so sure that we actually split ONE entree because they brought out 2 plates and they were heaping portions. That was super nice of them. Neither of us finished our food despite the fact that it was REALLY good. 

Service was spot on. 

A smiley, handsome gentleman (manager? owner?)  came to our table to ask about service and food. I'm always a big fan of that sort of presence. 

The menu here is fantastic. I'd love to return soon to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Annnnnd the coziest ambiance goes to Gamekeeper's. I loved the feel of dining here (especially with it snowing) it was so inviting and comforting, I felt like I was eating in a quaint cabin in the middle the woods (in a good, not creepy way.)  Our server was very friendly and had great recommendations. I started with the clam chowder that may have been the best I have ever tried. It wasn't too creamy and heavy and they sure don't skimp on the clam....there were a generous amount of impressive chunks of meat!! As an entree, I had the Everything Salmon which was delicious and cooked to perfection.I was torn between that and the penne (both recommended by our server) and cannot wait to go back to try more options! I brought my mom who came from out of town and loves to visit Chagrin and she couldn't stop raving about the place. Safe to say we will be returning."}
{"text":"Beautiful place to sit outside, but what's the use if the restaurant is understaffed and makes food poorly? I was so hungry afterwards. I ordered a $19 shrimp pasta that had about 2 shrimps cut up and the noodles were swimming on a puddle of oil/butter. You can tell my plate was made by someone who didn't care because there were 2 types of noodles in my dish. Our poor waiter was working so hard I didn't have the heart to tell him that his restaurant's food sucked. Where was quality control?!! Too many other nicer restaurants out there to try. If you go, get a meat dish, those looked like the most well executed."}
{"text":"I still have dreams about this food. Everything we had was great! The appetizers we had (antelope skewers) were a bit expensive for a very small portion, but still yummy. I had the wild boar sausage and lobster pasta and I highly recommend it. My boyfriend got the braised  bison short ribs which he \"would eat every night if he could\". Our waitress was pleasant. I only took away a star because the host was a bit rude as we walked in and she immediately and abrasively said \"We are only taking reservations right now\", which we had. She scoffed and annoyingly took us to our table. We asked she take a picture of our family at the end of the night and she was very rude about it. Maybe she had a bad day? Oh well."}
{"text":"Two words: antelope skewers. It would be worthwhile to go for these alone. 

The boar in the boar and lobster pasta was wonderful, but the overall dish was somewhat uninspired. Otherwise, I enjoyed the experience and concept, and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Always good food and service as well as a warm and cozy environment right in the heart of Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"A friend and I met friends who lived in Cleveland for dinner here while we were in town. It was a nice little place. We sat outside and ordered appetizers and each got a main course, The tuna appetizer was delicious [we got it and ordered another] along with the hummus. It was a spacious outdoor area and it was a comfortable evening. I got scallops in brown butter with various vegetables. It was very good. My friend ended up getting a whole wheat pasta dish which he said was good. The salmon dish was good. It was a memorable evening and should we return to Cleveland, we will make this a dinner stop."}
{"text":"Had relaxing lunch on great patio under the trees. Blueberry lemonade vodka and mojito were strong and tasty! Turkey iceberg wedge salad was good, and my hot date liked his fish taco. Warm bread was also delish, something that used to be a given but now is a nice to find! Great atmosphere, and great service too."}
{"text":"Wow, so pretentious and overpriced .. From the menu to the bedazzeled with jewelry adorned server. (Do they make that much in tips?). . 
Had the elk that everyone raved about?.. How did it never be mentioned it tastes like liver which I hate..   Spouse had duck, really over cooked , crusty overdone edges.   
Inedible.  .  Risotto was ok, I was thankful it was on the plate.  
Would never ever go back , there are so many places that serve good quality food you don't need to submit to this crap."}
{"text":"Awesome meal. Had pear and goat cheese salad and salmon w sweet potato. Hubby had fish taco and scallop appetizer also very good"}
{"text":"Beautiful rest. Waitress was very nice and explained the menu to us. Food was excellent. We had the ribeye and salad. Very good steak.i would compare it to Ruth Chris's. Drinks were great. Only complaint would be that their menu online is a little different than the menu at the rest. They offered no ostrich skewers, and no chocolate mousse. Other than that,we had a great evening and we will def. be back."}
{"text":"Five years since my first review in 2010, we continue to enjoy Gamekeeper's Taverne for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, and their annual Fall clambakes.  They continue to offer an eclectic menu of meats such as tuna tartare (appetizer), steak tartare (appetizer), wild boar sausage (appetizer), trout, and elk loin although their delicious ostrich skewers were recently removed from their menu.

The ahi tuna tartare is always one of my favorite appetizers here.  It's a marinaded raw tuna salad on won tons topped with greens and caviar.  Delish!!

I was blown away by the steak tartare appetizer during our most recent visit as well.  The \"patty\" of raw beef tasted sweet and fresh and paired perfectly with the crumbled egg yolk, minced red onion, minced pickles, and the mayonnaise-based sauce served alongside. 

Their arugala salad with candied pears and goat cheese was a nice pairing of flavors - something I wouldn't have everyday but can appreciate on special occasions! 

You can't go wrong ordering the elk loin which is served on a bed of risotto with mushrooms topped with strands of crispy fried onions.  And you aren't asked for your temperature preference on this - it'd be sacrilege to request anything outside of how the chef presents it: medallions seared on the outside, rare inside.

Their annual Fall clambakes, which are held over 2 or 3 weekends in October in a heated tent outside, are wonderful and great for get-together meals with friends.  Steamed littleneck clams, mussels, thick chunky clam chowder (New England), yams, corn-on-the-cob, rolls, steak/chicken or lobster (optional), and more rule the night!  Advance reservations absolutely required and completely worth it.

Speaking of reservations, I routinely make restaurant reservations either via phone or online via OpenTable and never ever had an issue with the table being ready and on-time for us.  In fact, flowers I order (from an outside florist) are always at the table waiting for us by the time we arrive!

NOTE:  Clambake and outside patio reservations are by phone only.

Words to describe the decor and ambience here: timbers, fireplace, candlelit, somber but not depressing.  

Not sure how a few reviewers had a bad time in either service or food quality here.  Maybe we treat the host and wait staff with respect and pleasantly and therefore always receive the same?   Or we just stick with dishes we feel are their specialty?  I don't know.  While I'm not suggesting that other Yelpers' experiences are invalid or self-inflicted, the fact is, after years of patronizing this establishment, we've NEVER had a problem with food or service and are more than happy to return time and time again.  Five stars are definitely deserved."}
{"text":"Maybe Gamekeeper's is just better for dinner? Or maybe my recent lunch was just an off day, either way--I wasn't impressed. 

We sat out on the patio, which is lovely! I tried the tomato bisque lunch combo with a house salad topped with grilled chicken. The salad itself was pretty fresh, light on the dressing and very tasty. The chicken was grilled OK--but kind of dry and it needed something. I don't know... it was pretty bland. The bisque was the big fail, in my opinion. It had a soapy taste to it and it really did taste premade--almost like it came out of a Sysco bag. I figured they'd make their tomato bisque homemade, considering it's not very difficult, and I don't know for sure, but it did NOT taste homemade or fresh. 

The service was just OK. I probably wouldn't ever go back, unless it was for dinner and I was getting an entree. But you can only use that excuse for so long. Salads and soups, although simple, can be made with lots of care and creativity and be very fulfilling when made right."}
{"text":"The stars is more indicative of the service then the food. I had their burger and was very impressed with how good it was. The meat tasted very fresh and they gave you a very generous serving of seasoned fries. More pricey then a typical burger and fries but also a higher quality and more of a portion then you would receive from a typical restaurant.

The service though was a little disappointing. Being young and not very formally dressed my guest and I were put in a two-person booth out of sight of all in a hallway when plenty of seats were available in the other dining rooms. Took a long time after our order was placed to receive bread and butter, but no utensils. My guest and I were comfortable enough to dunk our bread in the butter though--perhaps it was best for them to place us in our own empty hallway. Grabbing our server to receive utensils was difficult because of our location. Refills on drinks were slow as well.

Very friendly atmosphere, just not the best experience I have ever had at a restaurant for the first time, especially for the price you are paying. Maybe I just got unlucky."}
{"text":"Average at best. We went on a Monday evening and sat on the patio, which was a nice space. However, it wasn't busy, and as other reviewers have mentioned, the service was okay at best- kind of slow. Our server was nice, but he seemed too busy training at least two new employees (separately - we spoke with only the female trainee but observed him training a male as well). We were excited when we ordered a delicious-sounding drink. It came out strong but not necessarily tasty. We had to have lemonade added so we could enjoy it. 

The food was also just okay. Not sure if bread service is standard, but we saw other tables with it and had to ask for ours. We started with gazpacho, which was probably the best thing I had, and it wasn't outstanding. The fried green tomatoes were good, but nothing to write home about. I ordered the elk. The meat was delicious but the pepper gnocchi lacked flavor and the orange balsamic glaze around the plate just seemed like a standard balsamic to me. There were only two pea pods served - more of a garnish than a side. My friend ordered the chicken, which was on the dry side. The wording on the menu made her think it would be gnocchi with a basil cream sauce, but it came out as a basil gnocchi with some kind of broth, just not what she expected. All in all, the experience was quite underwhelming considering the prices and the fact that we'd both been wanting to check out Gamekeepers for a while."}
{"text":"Average food for premium prices. Everyone seemed angry, from the 14 year old bus boys to the adult management. Overheard several arguments and generally felt uncomfortable. We've dined all over Cleveland but I won't be returning here - too many better options."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner with some friends and if you like wild game dishes or trying new things, this is the place for you. We had the crispy pheasant thighs, the elk loin, duck breast and shepherds pie. Not one dish was disappointing. The flavors melded with the meat were a pleasant surprise. The quality of the entrees is worth the cost. The atmosphere is pleasant and ambient, and our waitress was great."}
{"text":"Suggested meeting a few friends in their tavern room after work on a snowy Friday since their happy hour continues to 7:00pm.  Turned out to be a good choice.  Not crowded.  Good size pours of their house wines and happy hour appetizer specials.  All priced nicely.  Needless to say we continued beyond 7:00."}
{"text":"I had my first experience of this place this past weekend while in town to see a play at the CVLT.  I had expected an east-side version of the White Oaks restaurant in Westlake and got something pretty similar with a little more.

My experience with wild game fare was highly limited, but I did enjoy the Mac & Cheese with boar sausages.  I'm not sure I can adequately rate the food without another visit, but did greatly enjoy what I had.  The cozy ambience of the place with low lighting and fireplace sold the visit.  Had it only been summer we could have dined outside by the river and waterfalls!

This will only be a once-a-year visit at best given the high price and distance from my home on the west side, but if I have a need for a very special occasion in this area Gamekeeper's will be my first choice!"}
{"text":"I had vaguely heard of this place, but don't go to Chagrin Falls too often.  That might change.  Parking is a bit confusing.  There is very limited parking on site, and valet parking down the street.  Nice bar, nice outside seating area.  Good menu with nice seasonal appetizers and entrees.  Bar drinks were also well made.  Service was good.  Nice place to go, especially on a warm day to eat outside and chill out."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant in Chagrin Falls.  It has the feel of old upscale lodge with wood panels along the wall and a fireplace.  The bread was soft and delicious.  The poached pear salad with gorgonzola and walnuts was excellent.  The fried green tomato appetizer was my favorite part of the meal, breaded and then coated with bacon crumbs.  The crab cakes were good though I've had better ones.  The moscow mule was the best one I have ever had, refreshing like lemonade, perfect amount of sweet and sour.  The place is a little pricey with entrees between 20-30$, appetizers 7-13$ and salas about 10$."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal in a beautiful outdoor patio setting.  I ordered the shrimp appetizer ($19) as my entree and knew that the shrimp was chopped.  What I didn't know or was told that the chopped shrimp couldn't have been one small one.  The serving was a disgrace and was refused."}
{"text":"Items like the Penne Pasta and Angel Hair, the Elk and the clam chowder, will always be great. Its good food with good service."}
{"text":"Like everyone says, the patio is really one of the nicest places in town that you can dine (when the weather in Cleveland cooperates). The food, however, doesn't quite match up to the surroundings but is fine, albeit kind of pricey for what it is. The service can be all over the board. They can be spot on. They can rush you through your meal or just be completely MIA. You never know what you will get. They also have a tendency to want to put fruit into everything and I am just not a fan of cooked fruit."}
{"text":"A unique style of restaurant that tends to specialize in game meat such as the elk, an board my friend an i had for his birthday dinner. Such a hospitality and all tightly surround by the wonderful Chagrin Falls area and its quaint small town feel. The restaurant itself is very swanky and is nestled inside an old home all traditionally renovated to fit quite a large amount of people yet still feel like eating at grandmas house. Though this isn't grandmas old-style cooking. This is a masterful way to craft some extremely unique types of meals and make them easily available for people whom are either worrisome about trying new things or have never tried something as unique as elk. All together is place is rather fancy and wonderful. its defiantly not a once a week outing but such a delight to get to splurge when you can."}
{"text":"Wow. Our friend's took us here, as we were visiting from Buffalo, NY. We started out with an appetizer of fried green tomatoes. My wife got the 4 oz filet mignon, and I the Wild Boar special.

It was fantastic. Prices are a bit steep but this place is not for the frugal, nor is Chagrin. Enjoy the photos and try some of the fine craft beers and wine. A nice night out."}
{"text":"at one point  GT was a great place for dinner now Just bad food and bad service ..."}
{"text":"The ambience was nice but the chairs and table were horridly uncomfortable. The pheasant rolls tasted like average takeout food. The steak was cold and so were the root vegetable and mushroom sides. The lamb and sweet potato sides were the only redeeming features. It's too bad because I was very excited to come. Never coming again."}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here while checking out the cute Chagrin Falls area. We both really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant and our food. We were fortunate enough to visit during a short break from the rain so we had lunch on the patio. It was quiet and serene back on the little patio area. We both enjoyed the hanger steak and artisan romaine. The presentation and style of the dish was unique. The steak was tender and well seasoned. The romaine had the perfect amount of the white balsamic drizzled on top with delicious blue cheese, parmesan, and bacon pieces on top. It was definitely a nice stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Terrific food prepared exactly as ordered and wonderfully served.  Our server, Jen, added to the enjoyability of the meal.  The manager noticed an open window on one of our guest's car's windows when it started to rain, got the car keys and went outside to shut them.  Some of the complaints about the restaurant had centered on the \"attitude\" of the personnel, but I would give it A+"}
{"text":"I just started going to Gamekeeper's during the past year. Currently, I'm pregnant and I've lost my appetite at every restaurant I've tried during this pregnancy, except Gamekeeper's. 

I'm addicted to it. From their spectacular Cuban sandwiches to amazing salmon to their buttermilk salad dressing that I want to take home with me, it's all perfect. If I could eat every meal there, I think I would. Now, you might suspect that this glowing review is simply because I'm pregnant and craving their food, but everyone who has joined me for meals there has agreed with me: it's delightful. Everything is delicious. 

Beyond the food, well, the patio is a gem. It's magical. It's a great spot for cocktails or al fresco dining. It's the perfect hideaway to enjoy the weather and kick back with friends. 

The service is generally very good. Everyone is exceptionally nice, but I've had a few rough experiences with servers that I suspect were training. Otherwise, it's always great. I'm particularly impressed with their hosts/hostesses who handle the reservations and seating. They've been very nice when I've called to make special arrangements."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight and concur with some of the previous comments about the lackluster service.

We made a reservation through OpenTable.  We were seated at the worst table, despite only one or two other parties in the room...really high traffic area right by the kitchen/service station.

The table, did however, afford us a lovely view of the bar below, where we watched our server lean against the bar and socialize with some bar patrons for five minutes, with our glasses of wine poured and waiting in front of her.  

The food was fine.  My boyfriend had the elk, and I had the sirloin.  It was woefully undercooked- I asked for medium but was not prepared for the amount of blood that poured out of it when I cut into it.  Given that it was served over red pepper aioli, the mix of blood and aioli made my plate look entirely unappetizing.  

We had to flag down the server to ask her to see if my rare/medium rare steak could please be cooked a bit longer.  When she brought it back, she never bothered to stick around to check to see if it was cooked more to my liking.  In fact, she never came back again to check on us.

A nicer server came to clear our plates, and then our server plopped the bill down on her way to another table without saying a word.  We then had to ask her to take our credit card to run it, after her walking by again without even looking at us.

Overall, it was underwhelming and disappointing.  There are far better dining options in Chagrin, where servers actually seem to care about your dining experience.  We'll be frequenting those places instead of Gamekeepers in the future."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite close to home outside patio bars.  

The fresh fish selection is pretty impressive too."}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary at Gamekeepers because we had a great coupon deal for the restaurant. The menu had a wide range of choices including pastas, fish and meat - and offered \"small\" plates. I took advantage of the small plate entree so I could have an appetizer, salad and dessert! All were good - my meat was prepared rare when asked for medium, but I don't mind that much. The waitress comped our desserts - cheesecake and carrot cake for the mistake because I was almost done eating it when she noticed the kitchen's mistake. 

Tastewise, nothing blew me out of the water but we had a nice atmosphere even when surrounded by large parties. Everyone seemed to know eachother - must be the Chagrin Falls representation Angry B mentioned :) The pace was nice and slow and we really enjoyed the experience.

We will go back for dinner again and will also sit outside on their large patio!"}
{"text":"A couple friends and I went to gamekeepers because it's right by our home and it always seems busy. We walked in expecting a more up beat feel but it was pretty quiet and laid back. It has more of an older crowd and would be good for a date because it's intimate. 

The staff was extremely nice and explained the food and drinks to us since it was our first time there. The bartender made me a ginger cocktail that was so refreshing (and of course I can't remember what she called it) and the food made you feel warm and comfortable in side. 

Like I said, it was an older crowd so going there with friends wasn't the best idea but we got a table in the bar area which helped a bit. Other than that it was delicious and the drinks were fabulous. I am looking forward to going back on a date with my fiancé in the winter and sit next to the fireplace and have a nice glass of wine."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Gamekeeper's.  Some co-workers suggested that I try this spot in Chagrin Falls and sit on the patio.  Unfortunately the evening that we were there was rainy, so we had to sit inside.

Gamekeeper's has a hunting lodge vibe to it and is a very cozy restaurant.  I imagine that it is really nice in here on a cold night when they light the fires.

As far as the food goes, it was delicious!  I had to short ribs which came with mashed potatoes and horseradish sauce.  All very very good.  Most other people at my table got filet mignon and one even got elk.  Everyone left full and happy with their meals.  Although Gamekeeper's is a bit on the pricey side, it is definitely worth it for the quality of food that you get!"}
{"text":"Perfect.  This is one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time.
We began with a Dortmunder an a Cosmo. They were great!  The cosmo was perfectly mixed; not too strong or weak.  
Then we ordered the crab cakes, which came with slaw; these were delicious, and the slaw was slightly spicy.  Served alongside crusty warm bread and butter, it was the perfect beginning.
We ordered the beef medallions oscar and the wild boar pasta....very delicious!  Very rich and flavorful.  We finished with the chocolate mousse-it was the best I have had since I worked at the Ritz.  You must try it.  
The service, food, quiet ambiance....all five stars.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service is great. The food is good. They make a great martini! One of the bartenders always remembers exactly how I like them. I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Why half a sandwich? Went there for lunch with the other white hairs & ordered salad and grilled cheese. Got a small salad and 1/2 a sandwich ! What did u do with the other half? After
My wife & I left ( $90 check - had small $14 glasses of wine) we felt short changed. Seniors want good value too! Come on - you've done better."}
{"text":"This is a truly great restaurant with great food. A lot of people likes the outdoor patio like me. So, I haven't visited the dining room yet. The food is so well prepared, elegant and taste great. 

Definitely a great place to go."}
{"text":"Had eggs Benedict with home fries. Home fries had obviously been kept warm in the oven too long--they were dry and inedible. When I pointed it out to the waiter, he just said they were made today and walked away! Really!!?? We'll never go back here again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I had high hopes that Valentine's Day dinner at Gamekeeper's Taverne would be a good experience based on the word of friends and the online reviews.

Wow, was I wrong....

Started by being seated in this \"nice booth\" in the hallway right by the front door. The entire dinner we felt cold air coming in and had to listen to the air curtain kick on every time the door was opened, and either guests at another table or the hostesses talk about rather inappropriate things.

Next we met our waitress (if Gamekeeper's Taverne would like a name I would be happy to provide it, but don't feel it is fair to post it here). I had looked at the menu online before we made the reservation and had picked out what I wanted, but it was not listed on the Valentine's Day menu. I asked our waitress if I would be able to get that dish since I'm a pretty picky eater, but her answer was a short \"no\". No explanation or apology for the inconvenience. Just a simple \"no\". So I ordered next closest thing.

Throughout dinner we had empty water glasses that sat unfilled numerous times, very rarely did she ask if we needed anything or how everything tasted (which wasn't that great). Anything we did ask for took way longer than it should have. We finally finished dinner and desert and were ready to get out of there, but we were given the wrong check. Took 10 minutes before she returned to our table again, and another 10 before we got the correct check. If it were up to me, she wouldn't have gotten more than 5% tip. And that seems generous. A $100 dinner on a special occasion should not be remembered as the worst dinner out I can ever remember.....

I hope this was just a freak incident and nobody else's dining experience was as poor as ours. We surely won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Two is a very generous rating, only because of the
great patio setting.  My small pork chop was dry, flavorless, and over priced at $26.  The stuffing that came with it was gummy and not warm. The draft beer was not even cool, or cold as it should have been.
We come to Gamekeepers a few times each summer and the quality has gone down the last few years.  
As I reflect a two rating is more than they deserve.
The most important thing of dining out is the food,
all else is a bonus to enhance the experience."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend for the early part of my Sunday Funday. I'm not sure why but I just can't get it right with gamekeepers. My friends and I were in the bar area. Started off pretty slow and as it got closer to dining hours it got more busy. The crowd was older which I don't have a problem with. It seemed like they were all friends with the bartender b/c he really didn't seem to leave behind the bar. We were at a table and had to go up to get any refill we wanted after our first round. I didn't eat this time so this is strictly based on service and atmosphere. Seems like this place is a huge hit for a lot of people. Maybe I go on bad days...."}
{"text":"My collogues and I decided to try GT for independent restaurant week. I think their menu and selection was the best bang for the buck.
Salads and clam chowder were excellent. Boar schnitzel was a bit greasy. Plank salmon with sweet teriyaki glaze was good but paired with pureed sweet potato and marshmallows was a plate full of beige sweetness. The choc mousse was delish but the gingerbread was bland.
I'd come again because the building was so sweet and cozy and everyone working there was great. The bar looked adorable but filled with very \"happy\" happy hour people. Will make it in earlier if that's the case.
Looking forward to trying to give it a better review next time!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! Original woodwork, adorable little booths that look like their own cozy train car, a slate walkway that invites you inside...but not a very inviting staff. I had made reservations for my partners birthday back in Oct. (you can't check in anywhere in Chagrin Falls, the wi-fi is non existent & I found out the hard way if you own a Blackberry you can't use Yelp or any other useful app) but when we arrived there was no hostess or staff to be found. After debating what to do, the bartender eventually came to our rescue ten minutes later. 
   While we were waiting, they had classical playing in the bar that you could hear through the window, what put us off was the awful rap music you could hear loudly playing from the kitchen. I couldn't even hear my partner sitting directly next to me & had to listen to this crap throughout the entire meal. The building itself is very cold and the creepy little womens bathrooms was like walking into the cooler at work. Tiny, dark and freezing! 
  My partner loved his food, venison tartar,etc but I was so unimpressed with the menu I didn't order anything. Even the desert options were a disappointment and the prices are way too high! $16.00 for a pile of fries with gravy & cheese on it- seriously! I could get those at Bob Evans for less then $8.00 and guarantee it would taste the same. Even the \"unwind your mind\" martini I had couldn't help me relax. Our waiter however felt so bad that I hadn't ordered anything that he asked the chef if he could just give me a plate of plain fries and not charge me the full price - our waiter was awesome and had a great sense of humor. In fact his company  was the only part of the meal I enjoyed. 
   Maybe I'm being too critical here, it's not that I wouldn't recommend this place but it'll break your wallet and your heart if you're an animal lover. My partner picked this place out; I didn't care for all the taxidermist critters on the walls or the overall service. When I got to a place like this I expect a little more and not to feel as if I'm sitting in a run down club."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland to see may dad, whose health is declining.  He is cold all the time, so I actually googled \"Cleveland restaurants with a fireplace,\" and found this wonderful gem out in Chagrin Falls.  Everyone was so kind to my dad, especially our server, who took plenty of time to make us feel welcome without overwhelming us.  We were the very first people there for lunch and it was nice and quiet.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday for a late dinner. Split a delightful bottle of red wine (half off on Mondays!) with my husband.  The duck was absolutely out of this world -- as good as I've had anywhere. Perfectly seared, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I would make a special trip just to have that dish again.  My husband had the elk (medium rare), simply delicious -- cooked perfectly.  I don't have elk often, and this was a standout example.

Because it was late, they were out of a few of the more popular items, like the wild boar. So if you have your heart on something, get there early!

Extra points for the service as well.  We arrived slightly before our reservation and the hostess was good enough to ask us if we'd like to be seated immediately or wait a few minutes for a better table. 

All in all, a fantastic and truly memorable meal. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"That's right, I gave the Cracker Barrel in Columbia, MO a better rating than Gamekeepers in Chagrin Falls.  This was our big date night in the middle of our cross-country move, and we were sent to swank, adorable Chagrin Falls by a good friend.  We randomly picked Gamekeepers off of Yelp and headed over.  

The patio is super cute and in a great spot right in the middle of what is obviously a very affluent little town.  We are Angelenos, and are no strangers to the all-in pocketbook dinner, so it's not like were expecting two-for-one wings or something.  We WERE expecting decent service and yummy food though, for the price that was paid.  I think Gamekeeper's really needs to step up their game- both in what they choose to put on the menu and how they prepare it.  Our waitress was a total pill and forgot everything or was MIA, and my pasta was the pits. For what it was, the food totally missed the mark- it was uninspired (unless they were inspired by TGI Fridays) and tasted poorly (weird choices in mismatched vegetables that did not set each other off and were overcooked.)  Mark's meat was fine, but nothing to write home about.  Overall, I think the swank set of the Cleveland suburbs is getting the rip by Gamekeepers.  Time to head to a major food center and find a new chef!

Overall, totally meh."}
{"text":"Had a real nice time here.   The service was very good.   We were seated at a large table that had plenty of room to handle our larger party.  I got the venison burger and it was great. The seasoned \"fries\" as I'll call them were a bit cold and cooked too long as they were hard.   Everyone in our party seemed to enjoy their food.  The only complaint I heard was the menu was a bit limited in options this time around but.  Or perhaps, the options offered just weren't what everyone was looking for.   Over-all it was nice dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has 3 very distinct ambiances (if that's even a word). I'll start with outside - AMAZING on a warm day. There are gorgeous colorful flowers everywhere and the air is charged with energy. Usually because every single table is taken, there's a line out the door and the servers are running around like crazy to keep up. Beautiful if you want to spend some time on their shady patio.

Inside is very different, but just as pleasant. Has a lodge type of feel - dark wood inside. We recently sat next to the fireplace, and it was quite romantic.

As for the food, it's always been great. Last time I had a small plate, and it was more than sufficient to be an entire dinner! Service was great.

Afterwards we grabbed a drink in their bar area. Different decor altogether - had a gothic type of feel to it. The bar was pretty quiet for a Friday night, but that's just what we were looking for."}
{"text":"Came here for thanksgiving dinner so I can't speak for the regular menu. BUT the thanksgiving dinner was excellent and I left very full. The dinner came with turkey, corn bread stuffing, cranberry sauce, mash potato, greens, and pumpkin pie for dessert. Service was excellent as well, especially since they had to work on the holidays. I would definitely go back to eat again because the service was excellent and in a nice small town."}
{"text":"Okay so let me preface by saying that I absolutely love the concept of this place...the decor and atmosphere speak to me directly as I grew up out in the country. My mother visited this restaurant years before I was born and suggested that I go there (nearly 30 years later!). I came here for my three year anniversary with my boyfriend and I wasn't disappointed. We split the walnut-crusted goat cheese salad as an app, each had the elk loin with gnocchi for our entree, and shared dessert. 

I only removed one star because of the portion to price ratio. We were charged an extra $4 to split the salad and our serving of elk was rather meager. Our bill ended up being around $75. Regardless, I would definitely come here again now that they have happy hour and date night specials."}
{"text":"This was a chance choice for us, but a delightful meal and atmosphere for my elderly mom and us.  The dinner was excellent, both the wild game meatloaf and the bison short ribs!  Dessert was an excellent finish, sharing one between two of us.  Servings are generous.  Service was sufficient on a busy Friday night.  For a setting that permits conversation, this is excellent."}
{"text":"I have somewhat mixed feelings about this place.  After looking at their website and their menu, I think I had too high of expectations.  The food and service was decent, but  \"voted top 10 cleveland restaurant\"?  Really?  I had the venison and my friend had the elk.  I think his elk was better than my venison - maybe because I've had better venison before.  The elk was very tender and if you like unique meat flavors, you should definitely try this one.  We had the crab cakes appetizer, which weren't even close to ones I've had in highway diners in Baltimore, MD.  Well, I guess I can't ding a place for things it's not known for.  And again, the service was only decent.  My glass of diet coke was 90% ice and 10% diet coke so that only seconds later, I was essentially drinking ice water.  I had to wait way too long for the waitress to refill my glass, again with too much ice.  Seriously, give me my diet coke!"}
{"text":"Gamekeeper's has probably had to fight to keep guests lately with M and Jekyll's opening, but this is my tried and true place! My go to. And it beats all the competition HANDS DOWN! The service is impeccable and the food is always excellent. They also have the best patio in Chagrin. Give those new places time for the hype to die down and everyone will figure out what I've known for years...Gamekeeper's is the best fine dining experience in Chagrin!"}
{"text":"5 of us had dinner on March 5, 2011. What a wonderful place. All of the food was great. I will go back if I'm ever in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"I've been putting off writing this review for ever, because Gamekeepers just didn't wow me on my most recent visit. It wasn't bad - not by any means - but it didn't give the above and beyond wow you expect from a place like this. 

The most memorable part of the evening was the start - the Tuna Wonton appetizer. Unfortunately the portion size was super small and my guest and I were hungry enough to order a second appetizer (Crispy Calamari). The tuna dish is based on rectangular crisps. Each crisp is topped with wasabi cream cream, Ahi tuna, drizzled in caviar and sprinkled with arugula. You get four such crisps topped with soy and srirachi.  

Aside from that the wine list is pretty decent, the fireplace makes for a cozy dining room lodge type atmosphere, and the main entrees were cooked to the requested temperatures."}
{"text":"This a great restaurant that never disappoints and certainly is one of the east side's legendary dining locations. The perfect place for a quality meal, fine wine and wonderful service and a pleasure walk before or after.

I Highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here and sitting outside on the patio. During the winter it's a bit boring inside. The food is always excellent and very consistent. Been coming here for years. Wonderful crab cakes"}
{"text":"Gamekeepers sure redeemed themselves from my bad experience years ago (before Yelp!). 

We went there on a Saturday night with a reservation for 6. We got there a few minutes early and grabbed a drink at the bar first. My pomegranate martini was delish- not too weak and not too strong. 

We were seated at a table with high-back seats, which we all thought was pretty cool. 

As for food, the antelope skewers are awesome. I never thought I'd like them (I'm sometimes hesitant to try new foods). The tempura shrimp were pretty tasty too.

My caesar salad was good, but seemed pretty average. I got the beef medallions for dinner. A bit pricey, but I loved it. The dinner came with two sirloin medallions in a madeira sauce, with two potato croquettes. I would go back and get it again.

We were too full to try dessert. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"So disappointing! We went here after abandoning this place five years ago because the reviews on Yelp looked good and Jekyll's has burned down. We had stopped going to Gamekeepers after a disastrously bad dinner we had there five years ago with my Grandmother. But the reviews on Yelp lured us back.

First, when we showed up for our reservation there was no one (and I mean no one) in the front. No bartender, no hostess, no servers. We stood in that cramped front space for more then five minutes. When someone finally showed up, he didn't seem like a host or a server. He was dressed ultra-casual and asked us (with a confused look on his face) if we wanted to eat. My father told him of our reservation (for which it was now past by several minutes) and he led us to a table.

It was several more minutes before a host showed up. He didn't have the best attitude. More like someone who resigns himself to work everyday so he can eat, but has no joy in his heart for it. It gave off an instant terrible impression of our meal (that turned out to be accurate). 

At our table we ordered the daily trout special, two of their Alonzo burgers, a slew of vegetable sides and the southwest salad. My sister and I enjoyed the meat of the burgers but the toppings were insanely off balance. There was so much cheese that it leaked over everything, creating a huge mess (that isn't fun to navigate when you're dressed nicely) and there were very few pickles. Additionally the fries on both our plates were overcooked (they were splotchy and dark brown) and tasteless. My mother enjoyed her salad but it didn't wow her. And the vegetables were fine but also not 'wow.

The true disappointment of the evening though was my Grandfather's trout dish. It was SO SALTY. I mean, I took one bite and spit out the orzo into my napkin. My tongue burned. He ate only the fish but he's not a complainer so I didn't realize it was that bad until I tasted it near the end of the meal. I am absolutely disturbed that that dish made it out of the kitchen. How anyone could think that's appropriate, I have no idea.

To be honest, the service was so sub-par and the food so wishy-washy in flavor I don't know that we will go back. Perhaps it was an 'off' night, and I'm always willing to give restaurants a second chance, but if after five years they still can't get their stuff together I'm not sure that they ever will."}
{"text":"Came on a date and it reflected very well on him. Everything I had was delicious!!! The scallops were made perfectly and the elk was delicious. I absolutely would go again to try other dishes and think that the menu is great for trying out something new. Of course the portions were normal for an upscale restaurant (small/ tastefully plated). Drinks were made correctly, wine selection was plentiful, service was attentive, knowledgable and friendly."}
