{"text":"Settebello is definitely the best Italian pizza i've had outside of Italy.  Their crust is bubbly, chewy and delicious.  They have some nice salads and a yummy focaccia (this is really just their pizza crust baked with some oregano and sea salt, but delicious none the less).  Great sangria, coctails, and espresso.  Unfortunately, their iced and hot teas are lipton (lame!!).  The margherita pizza is delicious, as is the four cheese (with gorgonzola and ricotta, yum!).  Their cannolis are good, traditional with dried fruit and chocolate chips but the shells and cream were both a little thick.  Their gelato is also good, but very airy and not dense like traditional gelato (great flavors though, including a seasonal apricot).  Comfortable atmosphere with tables and booths (props) and well worth the drive across town.  Five stars based on their pizza alone- delicious!"}
{"text":"good pizza! happy hour m-f 3-5 2 for 1 drinks and $5 mini pizza's, haven't tried it yet but will do in the future!"}
{"text":"This place has some amazing pizza. I'm someone who can't eat pizza at regular chain restaurants (ex. BJ's, italian restaurants, etc.) or delivery places (ex. Pizza hut, dominos, papa johns, etc.) because they produce such a poor quality pizza. Here they make all their pizza wood fired and having been to Italy before, this place tastes just like pizza you could find in Italy. Definitely recommend this place if you're craving Pizza and its in a really nice area as well."}
{"text":"Its like eating Pizza in Naples, Italy.  That's the way it made over there.  But when it comes to eating  authentic  , I highly recommend this place. The appetizers are good, the service is good , the pizza amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh hey Italy...thanks for moving in down the street from me!  My 4 year old wakes me up and asks if we are going back to Settebello every single freaking day of my life because she values the wood fired, folded slice of heaven.    Settebello has been a 2 times a week kind of a place for us...I don't see that changing any time soon."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town... I have been eating there once a month for a few years now , and i will never get tired of it ."}
{"text":"I am from Italy for real.  Pizza in Italy is considered an health food because the ingredients are few but fresh and the dough is thin but flavorful.  I was never able to find a real Italian pizza in the US before until I tasted Settebello's pizza when I moved to Las Vegas.  I say this after living in New York City which many claim has great pizza (I'm not one of them). If you're looking for American-style pizza with lots of toppings and fat, Settebello is not for you. If you're looking for an Italian pizza where ingredients are fresh, Settebello is for you.   La migliore pizza a Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! We tried a bunch of pizzas and our faves were the settebello and the basil one. Perfect crust and flavorful toppings. Thought it was better than pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"One of my usual spots to go to.  I love Settebello so very much!  The calzone is my favorite and reminds me of my travels in Italy.  The only place in the Vegas area for pizza IMHO."}
{"text":"Food was good! Would there again for the food only. The service was horrible!! One chef, one waitress, two bus boys that had no idea what to do and one back of house person."}
{"text":"Been going to both locations for about 10 years. Pizza is excellent. It is 'soggy' in the middle but the crust is chewy, charred, and crispy. It is delicious. My fave is the Settebello without pancetta. Yummy and satisfying. The pancetta makes it too salty and heavy.   They also have great cocktails. Usually get the Miguel Douglas. Had the barbershop medicine and it was delicious."}
{"text":"To save time, read Nelson's first paragraph in the very next review, then come back to mine.  I echo his sentiments there.  What makes places like this great is the thoughtfulness, and dedication to authenticity and quality that radiates throughout a restaurant.  The staff is very young, but attentive and capable, and you can tell they want to be there, or at least aren't loathing their employment.  I do feel sorry for them too having to deal with the knobs that come in angry they can't get a Pizza-Hut like disaster.  That magic oven got brought over form the Valle Verde location as well (I think), and the pizza chefs don't miss.  Dessert hits the mark every time as well.  The Bianca is my favorite, which from bottom to top includes that one-of-a-kind crust, buffalo mozz, prosciutto di parma, real parm slices, and arugula.  Messy, salty heaven.  If I do feel like tomato sauce, I'll order a margherita with pancetta and pine nuts.  I thank the pizza chef every time I leave.  This is the only place I feel the need to do this.  You should be grateful we have places like this, that Americanize nothing, and give us a treat unlike anything else in town."}
{"text":"This place is literally the best pizza joint in town. They are very traditional in their preparation and presentation. They import a lot of ingredients, and even some of their equipment directly from Italy. I eat here constantly, try the 'Misto', best appetizer ever!!"}
{"text":"A very good option when you want a relaxing and delicious meal away from the strip...especially if you're on your way out to or back from red Rock."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They have wonderful Neapolitan pizzas, my favorite is the Settebello.  I've been to Settebello four times and every time the experience has been great.  The pizza is amazing with a great thin crust and fresh toppings.  The service is always pleasant and fast.  If you like pizza you NEED to go to Settebello.  My only complaint is that they're located in Henderson and I live downtown, but Settebello is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in Las Vegas. Excellent pizza and salads every time we go here.  Truly Naples style pizza! We've always had great service here as we'll."}
{"text":"Hmm... I'm not quite sure what this is supposed to be, but I guess the closest comparison is to a piece of soggy bread. The tiramisu was good, but a restaurant shouldn't take pride in its desserts being better than its signature product."}
{"text":"I loved this place reminded me a lot of being back in Italy. This place serves as close to authentic pizza as I have found in Vegas and in Houston. We ordered two pizzas: a) margarita (tomato, basil, garlic, fresh mozzarella) and diavola (spicy pizza). Both pizzas were awesome - LOVED IT. The Wife not so much she said it was ehhh. We had panecotta for dessert but it had this berry glaze which could have been omitted. The panecotta was good - could use a little Madagascar vanilla bean in the mixing process. We would return."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  You can taste the difference from the ordinary Pizza. I am in love with the Pannacotta"}
{"text":"I love Chicacago, NY, and other American style pizzas- yet Italian pizza in it's most pure (all Italian ingredients subject to pure Italian style, preparation, and cooking) cannot be beat.  Settebello delivers just that. Other pluses are their espresso and campari on the rocks. I can't believe that this stellar pizza place is in the armpit of Nevada known as Las Vegas but it is and Vegas has much for which to be happy.   I won't waste the effort describing just how tasty and life changing this pizza can be, go have a taste and thank me later."}
{"text":"We had been out shopping all day and turned to you my fellow yelpers to guide us to a delicious meal for a reasonable price and you did not disappoint, so thank you!  We arrived and was quickly seated in a booth in Cory's section. He was personable, knowledgeable, and eager to accommodate at will. We ordered the Insalata Grande to share with the Pine Nuts on the side. Cory had the chef separate the salad into 2 portions and it was ooh so yummy. The shavings of fresh parmigiano was wonderful and the balsamic reduction was a perfect blend to cover but not saturate the leafy greens... so good my friends!  Alright the pizza... we ordered the Stellebono and of course modified it to accommodate my dislike for pine nuts and pancetta even though I am full Sicilian, I preferd to substitute artichokes and fresh garlic on my side. The oven cooks at a 1000 degree temp so if your pizza comes out a little more done or blackish in color than you prefer they are happy to remake it. We opted to just eat ours and it was delicious and a little juicy (from the toppings I assume.) WARNING: this is NOT your average pie. It is more of a gourmet pizza, so If you're looking for East Coast style pie this is not it.  We are good eaters and a single pizza and salad was enough to satisfy both of us comfortably.  When we come to Vegas we will stop back in for a more casual meal in a beautiful atmosphere at a decent price."}
{"text":"great service, reasonable prices, i'm not a big fan of their style of pizza but my husband is...but i'm not typically a big fan of salads, however they have one of three i have ever had that i absolutely love. so both my husband and i love to go there, i can eat healthy and love it and he can have his pie and eat it to :)"}
{"text":"This is our hands-down favorite pizza place in town.  We are locals and come here frequently.  The pizza is delish, the salads are sooooo good, they ALWAYS have a Polygamy Porter on nitro for my hubby and a fabulous glass of Malbec for me.  Andrew is our favorite waiter, with good reason.  He (and everyone there) is attentive, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile for us. We are regulars here, and I see no reason to not be.  If you're not a regular here, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Fresh, light, AMAZING pizza! I used to live in Italy and this is the next best thing!  DOC pizza is a must for anyone. I recommend starting with that and then going more adventurous.  Some of the flavored aren't for everyone and I won't lie I wasn't impressed with some of the weirder pizzas but their simple Doc (like a margarita but better) is simply perfect.   YUM!"}
{"text":"Even though there have already been excellent reviews written for this establishment, I need to include my kudos to the owners and staff.    My husband and I came across this restaurant by chance, as we were thumbing through one of the tourist magazines while waiting in line at a casino buffet. We were intrigued enough to add it to our \"to do\" list while we were in town last week.  We called on Wednesday night, to verify the hours of operation only to learn that they were out of pizza dough and would be closing earlier than anticipated.    Not to be dissuaded, we arrived around 1:30 pm Friday afternoon.  The place was busy, however, we were promptly seated.  Our service staff were very friendly and attentive.  After looking over the menu, it was clear that we would be ordering more than just pizza.   We ordered the Focaccia and Involtini di Prosciutto from the appetizer menu and for the main dish the Settebello Pizza.    The Focaccia was amazing with the sea salt and olive oil.  The dough was crisp yet chewy.    The Involtini di Prosciutto was a wonderful treat.  The baby arugula had a very mild peppery essence, but when combined with the mild goat cheese wrapped in salty prosciutto and drizzled with olive oil and balsamic reduction.  OMG, delicious!  Our only complaint was that we only received two.    The Settebello Pizza was an enjoyable experience.  The description that the pizza can be a little bit soggy was close to true.  Then again, I don't mind eating my pizza with a fork and knife.  I am not a big fan of sausage (I don't particularly care for fennel seeds), but even the sausage on this pizza was good.  The earthy combination of the mushrooms, pine nuts and pancetta was a tasty treat.  Then to add in the crushed tomatoes and mozzarella took this to the next level.  We left the restaurant very satisfied and happy to have found the ad for it.   As we were driving out of town the next day, my husband pulled out the \"to-go \" menu for Settebello's.  We called in an order for the Focaccia and the Involtini di Prosciutto.  We just couldn't resist taking advantage of one last opportunity to enjoy these tasty items before heading back to AZ.  This is not the American-style pizza that many of us have been force-feed over the years.   If you are expecting or enjoy the thick, doughy, greasy crust pizza, this is not for you.  For the rest, this is amazing pizza.  While I have never traveled to Itay, I can attest that this is one of the best pizza's I had the pleasure of enjoying in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian - doesn't get better than this. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the worst pizza places I've ever been to. If you want soup go to sweet tomatoes. Because that's what this pizza is like.  Truly a disappointment they should have stayed in Henderson where they belong."}
{"text":"It's not just a pizza place\" said my daughter when I was somewhat dismayed that Settebello was my daughte's choice for a last supper of sorts before she moved from Las Vegas to small town Wyoming.  The Napoletana pies are great, service is somewhat slow, but when you see the impressive oven that each pie is nurtured in it is understandable.  My daughter and I got the Quatro Formaggi, Yummy times 3 one thing missing was fontina, they were out of fontina and ssubtituted with ricotta, not my favorite for a pizza, thats why only three yumnmies.  Another at our table got the signature Setabello, great mix of flavors, if you love mushrooms you will give this four yummies, I personally would have liked more panchetta.  The other pie at our table was the Quatto, everyone gave this four yummies.    We enjoyed the meal and with all the dining choices there are in Las Vegas to choose a \"pizza place\" for a \"final\" meal says much about the quality of food."}
{"text":"We arrived at 4pm and found the restaurant in comparative darkness without any customers.  The latter actually worked in our favor because we had wonderfully quick service from a very knowledgeable server. We ordered a warm beet appetizer together with arancini ( rice balls ). The warm beets were served in a small cast iron skillet with chopped Italian almonds which were a delight followed by the arancini which were crispy and deliciously warm. So far so good. Then we had 2 pizzas. Mine was a \"bianca\" with just mozzarella arugula and parmigiano but I added basil and Kalamata olives. My husband ordered a basic pizza Margherita.  Both pizzas were nicely charred around the edges but the interiors were slightly gummy. Having said this I do think a little longer in the wood fired oven would have been the answer to make the base nicely crispier. The pizzas tasted very pleasant even so . We ordered 3 desserts to get the feel of the menu. A Tiramisu , some zeppole and a gluten free torta chocolate cake. All desserts were delightful but the Nutella free zeppole were the best I have tasted outside of Italy. The bill was around $93 but all things considered, this was indeed value for money due to us ordering far more than most people would even consider eating. An espresso following the meal was excellent and rounded off my early dinner very adequately.  I would highly recommend Settebello but suggest an early or late visit because I think this place would be overflowing at normal times to dine. We left here at 6pm and it was filling up quickly. A+++ for this local eatery."}
{"text":"If you are in Greenvally then this place is a MUST! true Italian Pizza - flour is imported from Italy.  The \"Settebello\" pizza is the way to go.  I like mine cut!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a vegetarian....but not tonight (don't judge me). Seriously the misto, the cheese, the pizza the service all absolutly stunning! It was a special night tonight and I wanted to try something new. Thanks to yelp I stumbled across settebelos. Being Italian and having a special nack for cooking it myself I'm always Leary when it comes to Italian restaurants but I gave it a try. When we walked in we were immediately greeted with a smile and a hello. We sat down, the server Justin was awesome. He explained the menu and we started with the misto. Incredibly tasty. The parm,  zucchini and the meats brought me right back to my Childhood. We went for the settebelo pizza and the Bianca pizza. I was born and raised in Vegas and let me just say we needed pizza like this. I havent left a Restaurant this happy in a long time. Thanks to the excellent ser vice and amazing food they have truly made a Special night memorable."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find real Neapolitan pizza in this area. This is the real deal.   Vera pizza. Qui si mangia bene."}
{"text":"We went there enticed by a feature on them on Food Network spotlighting their Italian braised pork pizza.  We were told that they only make it for Christmas.  We then ordered a smallish, overpriced pizza that was limp and soggy.  See ya!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  This is one of my favorite places in the world.  Whenever I am in town, I rush here for Happy Hour.  This may sound trite, but the ham, the cheese, the bread--my God!  The happy hour plates, pizzas, and calzones are out of this world and priced right."}
{"text":"Mitchell was our server. He was very knowledgeable. He educated us on the menu. Very helpful being our first time. He had great recommendations and the food was delicious. We will definitely go back. Pizza has great flavor and the Nutella pizza is so good."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Friendly servers,  amazing pizza, great wine selection!  Cory, Maddy, Adrian and Ryan are amoung my favorites. There is always a new pizza to try. I love the bright fun atmosphere and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"The hype is true! Its hard to stand out in the pizza crowd, but this place does it with ease. Like anyone else, I love pizza, but this place has something special. My favorite pizza hands down. If you haven't tried it...? More for me :)"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place I bring all My friends here, fresh ingredients great flavored and for all you thin crust lovers this is it. I would recommend the Divola has a hint of spicy , I have tried others and this is my favorite and the misto plate with a selection of meats and grilled zucchini olives and cheese served with focaccia it's a meal on its own. They just built a shaded patio which you can get happy hour at 2 for 1 drinks at the bar and patio the sangria is very refreshing on a hot summer day. The Nutella pizza is excellent if you still have room as well and the dream bomba dessert . I will warn you this not your typical pizza place it's not that over stuffed super cheesy tons of meat on pizza it's a light fresh flavorful classic napoletana pizza I walk out feeling satisfy without that over stuffed feeling . I love it . Lastly I will say I agree with other this service stuff is hit or miss sometimes simply terrible . It's a young college crowd waitstaff and at times I almost feel I am an inconvenience asking for a new clean plate or an extra napkin. It's almost like its a chore to serve us . At times not friendly and they seem annoyed . The hostess girls in the from have always been great and always get my order accurately and on time when I get to go but the servers can be hit or miss as I have said they need better customer service skills. So it's all about the food here not the service that's what makes me keep coming back !! Walk in with an open mind and try it !"}
{"text":"We were incredibly impressed with the service we recived from this neighborhood pizzaria this evening. We didn't realize they closed at 9 when we went in for dinner at 8:40 p.m. tonight. We were offered food to go and gladly accepted it. There were four of us, my daughter and I split a panzanella salad and a pizza that had jalapeño in the name, I wish I could recall the exact name, it was excellent. It had jalapeño jelly, mozzarella, red onion, an Italian ham and basil. So spicy and delicious! My husband and my son-in-law both loved their pizzas also. We will return when we have time to enjoy the nice atmosphere of the dining room and more of their great customer service."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good but our waiter, tam, was spectacular. He was enthusiastic, had a smile on everytime i saw him. Was very good at checking on our table regularly. Thanks Tam!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is excellent! I do not like thin crust but the authentic pizza at Settebello is the exception. I can't describe this pizza other than delicious. It's expensive for a small size pizza but the flavors make up for it. Order here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a late dinner here. They bake the pizza at 900 degrees for one minute. It feels a bit burned. I had mixed feelings about it. Atmosphere was nice. Service was just right. Would like to try other items in their menu next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and my first time here and we loooooove it!!! The atmosphere and food is great and has a yummy cocktail menu with great prices!"}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is so good! I'd forgotten how good it was until I went again last night. I ordered the Settebello pizza - delicious! My friend and I shared the La Bomba dessert, which is also delicious (peanut butter gelato with caramel in the middle all coated in chocolate - yes please!) The service was great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Meh.  There's a reason methods of cooking pizza has evolved over the past two hundred years.  C'mon guys, put some damn cheese on the pizza.  The salad tastes like grass.  Literally, outdoor grass.  A little pricey too.."}
{"text":"Good was great!!  Desserts awesome! Had the tiramisu had to take some home..  Drinks were ehh  Service was ehh"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Felt like I was back in Italy. We had the Margarita Doc and added mushrooms. Also got the Panzaneta salad (not sure how to spell it). Loved the ambiance and decor.  Will definitely be back. Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"Love it!  I studied abroad in Italy when I was in college and this is one of the only places that comes close, is on par and/or supersedes pizza I ate almost on a daily basis there.  My favorites are the Settebello and Diavola; the Diavola is super spicy for me.  As much as I love the pizza, I do not always love the service.  Some waiters/waitresses are great, while others appear to be college students who can't be bothered.  E.g., if we ask for something, like straws or additional napkins, they seemed annoyed or are slow to come back to the table.  Nonetheless, the pizza is great so we keep going back.  (And the stars are for the food.)  Also, while the pizza is super good, the gelato is FANTASTIC. This is hands down the best gelato I've had outside of Italy, and a MUST every time. There's usually a special gelato of the day/week, in addition to what's listed on the menu.  If there's anything that's a must try, it's the gelato."}
{"text":"Ever since I saw an episode of Man v Food that talked about the Vera Pizza, Napoletana certification, I've been looking for a place that made truly authentic pizza. When I ordered their signature pizza, the cashier said that it would take 5 minutes. Now that's a sign of a super hot oven that properly cooks a pizza. The dough was super thin with a crispy puffy outer crust. The toppings toppings were very fresh and the sauce wasn't overly salty like most pizzas. I even liked the fennel sausage and I absolutely hate fennel. I now feel cheated by the other pizzerias that claim to have authentic pizza."}
{"text":"By far, one of the best pizza joints in South Las Vegas.  Perfect Italian style fire burned pizza.  Appetizers during happy hour are delicious.  Atmosphere is great, owners are great and staff is great.  We even hosted one of our monthly club meetings here and they handled a group of 22 flawlessly.  When we have that pizza craving, Settebello is always our go-to choice.  Bellisimo!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some fantastic Neapolitan style pizza look no further! Every pizza I have tried here has impressed me. The crust is somethings special,  elegantly simple, as it should be, but packed with flavor and texture to support the toppings, and cooked to perfection in a brick oven. All of the combinations of toppings I have tried follow the same theme, perfection. Not to mention that the beer list is somethings to envy."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Knock your socks off pizza with fresh generous toppings! It has the perfect ambiance to make pizza feel kind of classy lol. I mean it's pizza: You don't need to dress it up much, we already love pizza. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The last time that I dined at Setebello the meal was beautiful so I couldn't wait to come back.  Today I took a friend to lunch and we were served burned pizza, so I showed the waitress the black crusts including the bottom and edges.  She confidently assured us that the \"blackening\" is a natural part of the baking process without even offering an apology.  She did offer to have them remade but after that explanation we figured we would just be served 2 more black pizzas, so we politely declined and left hungry.  I don't know what was more distasteful, the burned food or the waitress's cavalier attitude."}
{"text":"Service has really tanked under new management. Servers are usually too busy chatting amongst each other, and I recently had to wait an hour for a to go salad and focaccia bread. Yeah, I called ahead and was quoted twenty minutes. No biggie. Waited an additional 35 minutes in store for my food. Asked for extra olive oil, balsamic, and lemons on the side. Got salad dressing and didn't realize it until I got home. The food is still the same, but it just doesn't feel like my good ole neighborhood pizza joint these days"}
{"text":"Settebello is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in LV.  The staff is warm and welcoming and the pizzas are spectacular.  I recommend the Quattro formaggi and the carbonata.  I would have given them 5 stars, but they recently changed the mozzarella they were using on the  caprese salad and on the pizza.  The old mozzarella was absolutely perfection and it was a huge disappointment when they changed brands.  When they change back,  I will immediately change to a 5*!"}
{"text":"They do a nice twist on pizza and we enjoyed it. However, I thought it was pricey and not the best value for money.  I think it'd be a great place to go on a date with someone that you're just getting to know and would like to make a good impression on. I don't believe that we could afford to make this our family's friday evening place."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  My husband and I live more than 30 minutes away, and I refuse to eat pizza anywhere else.  We must brave I-15 every time we go (which is always seems to be a virtual parking lot), resulting in a 35 minute commute each way.  I have dined at Settebello an average of twice per month since my last review in August 2009, and have yet to be disappointed.  It is amazing the level of friendliness, attentiveness and overall customer service that is consistently  maintained by the staff.   Settebello is extremely family-friendly.  Since most of our friends have young children, it has been a wonderful choice for us to meet up and enjoy a meal together.  They offer all children imported Italian breadsticks to keep them occupied, while parents peruse the menu; additionally, there is a child's tomato/cheese pizza (only slightly smaller than the regular size Margherita) which comes with a complimentary scoop of gelato for dessert.  I just had to get another 2 cents in because it is very easy to have one great meal somewhere, but another feat entirely to have EVERY meal be tasty and delicious, backed with great service."}
{"text":"fortunate to have such authentic pizza in Henderson. Everything is good Quattro fromage is a favorite. Do not expect American pizza fare here, leave that abomination for dominoes. This is the real deal."}
{"text":"This one star review is based only on the swing bar staff. the food here is great. but ALL of the girls behind the bar are so incompetent it's painful to watch them. if the drink isn't spelled out on a note card they can't make it, makes sense that I've never had the same drink taste the same... for such a wonderfully designed bar, a great bar menu and liquor selection they sure don't give a shit about who's behind the bar and how they train them. would love to hang out there but would rather spend $11 on a cocktail that's made correct some where else"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pizza. We had the margherita, bolognese, and diablo pizzas. I really liked the margherita pizza. It's a very thin crust pizza, but the crust stays soft in the wood fire oven. The size is decent for a personal pizza, but it is defiantly more of a traditional type pizza, sorry dominos lovers, this is not for you. The service was very good, but also very slow in my opinion. I also thought the pizza was a bit overpriced, but so is everything in the district. Over all if you like this type of pizza, the place is nice and you will probably enjoy this restaurant. If the American style pizza is more your speed, this is defiantly not that."}
{"text":"I love my man, believe me, but everytime I eat here, I want to kiss the man who makes my pie. It is the most perfect pizza you can make...everytime. If you are looking for Dominos or Pizza Hut-style pizza, this is not for you. If you are looking for crispy flatbread, topped with gourmet ingredients (many flown in from their native lands) and cooked right, this is your new favorite! It is never crowded for a late afternoon bite, but be careful on a weekend evening. It is not bursting at the seams, but there may be a little bit of a wait. If all of the five star reviews so far don't lead you to believe it's the best, go try it and prove them wrong!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! I haven't tasted pizza this good since I lived I Italy. Outstanding! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I give 3.5 stars here.  Essentially, I give 4-5-stars to a place I would return tomorrow.  This pizza didn't do that for me.   And, all 3 of the pizzas we had today seemed to lack ingredients and what little ingredients were included seemed to just fall right off before entering our mouths.  Now I get that the Napolean style, true Italian pizza is supposed to be \"wet\" like this.  But it was hard to eat - even with a fork and knife like they suggest.    The pizza dough and crust was very good, but sliding cheese and toppings made it too much effort.  We tried the namesake Settebello, the Diavlo, and the kids cheese & sausage.  Hands down, the DIAVLO pizza was the best!  It was spicy and unique enough to stand out and be memorable.  The Settebello was simply forgettable.  We liked that there is a kids-menu (hidden, not on the menu) for $6.50 that is plenty of food for 2 kids, much less one.    They encourage you to order an individual pizza for each adult, but you could easily share one pizza for two people (with a shared salad or appetizer).    While I wanted to love this place and had it bookmarked for several months, it just wasn't my style.  The ambience is nice and the service was good, but I will keep seeking out good pizza in this town!"}
{"text":"I have been on a quest to find great Pizza, unfortunately this is not.  I gave it one stars because it did have flavor but the crust is chewy and it reminded me of pita bread Not good. You can't pick a slice up with your hands. If you like Napoletana pizza this might be ok although I have never been to Naples.  I haven't been to the Henderson location but I didn't think it will be much better if the recipe is the same.  Everyone has an opinion and we all have our own taste.  The reviews that were 5 stars I can't for the life of me understand why unless they don't know great pizza.  Chicago and New York have great pizza and I will continue to search. ( Check this one off the list)"}

{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. They had 2 waiters for the entire restaurant and even had the buss boy serving. The food was good but the service definitely takes away from it....very understaffed."}
{"text":"Probably the closest to Neapolitan Pizza you're going to get outside of Italy! I'm a huge fan of Buffalo Mozzarella (creamier, softer, and sweeter than than cheese from normal cows), which they have here (The Margherita DOC). You'll never go back from buffalo mozzarella -- go the extra mile. You'll never (and should never) go anywhere else for pizza in the Valley."}
{"text":"Pizza is a way of life for me. I take it as serious as somebody would take an IRS audit or having a child. Pizza holds the hope of a nation inside of it's golden flaky crust. We are the children.   Whatever. This is Las Vegas, home to thousands of transplants from the mid-west. Anytime somebody talks about pizza, everybody has some random story about the hole in the wall from their town that makes the best pizza ever. Every place out here is a chain or a gut bomb grease fest. What does it take to get a decent pie out west?   I'm not sure Settebello qualifies. This pizza is sort of a subsidiary of the normal pie quest I reference above. Yes, it is pizza. Sure, it is delicious, but it's not what you're thinking of when you're sitting around with a few buddies watching a football game and somebody says \"Hey, let's get a pie\".   Settebello is a traditional pizza in every sense of the phrase. They have several topping choices which will remind you of your typical topping choices, but taste 10x better. On this occasion I ordered the Margherita pizza with the wood fired sausage. It was amazingly good, but again, not a normal pie. The sauce is basically crushed tomatoes, but the best tasting crushed tomatoes you could imagine. They throw a little basil and mozzarella on there and you're good to go.   If you don't arrive here expecting a pie in the American sense of the word, you'll be just fine. Just make sure you ask them to cut the pizza for you, because they won't if you don't ask them.   Minus one star because the olive oil / vinegar bottles they leave on the table leak EVERY SINGLE TIME, which prompts you to have it on your cell phone, or shades, or all over your hands, etc. It's annoying.   Yo Settebello, get some new oil / vinegar bottles, na'mean?"}
{"text":"I started coming to Settebello when they first opened this location. I came every week up until I moved out of state 4 years ago. I finally move back to vegas and this is the place I missed so much. 12/14/16 Such a disappointment with the service and the food. I am very familiar with the style of pizza this place serves I know it very well since I was a regular earlier years, but this time around I was so disappointed. Our server was absolutely the worst! Took forever to get refills and to go boxes seems like we were forgotten about. The pizza was lacking flavor and toppings! It was also burnt. The server never came around to ask how our food was. This experience was unpleasant and I'm not sure if I would return"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent, went there twice during my training while in Henderson/Las Vegas.  Both times the pizza was excellent, the staff was very knowledgeable about what they served on the menu, and the beer selections were unique while very satisfying."}
{"text":"Really fresh, top notch pizza. Quality will blow your mind. The prosciutto appetizer is also one of my favorites. Service is great on the inside."}
{"text":"After living in Italy for a year I thought I'd never find pizza I liked here in Vegas. I was so thrilled to find this pizzeria as the pizza is fantastic! The thin crust is perfect and the toppings are perfectly paired! They have specials everyday for example $4 margaritas on Thursday and 50% off bottles of wine on Tuesday. Happy hour also has a lot of good choices for food and drinks. The service is excellent! Everyone is attentive, polite and fast!  All in all this is my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Driving out to Green Valley is worth the drive, if you're looking for Napoletana style pizza.    What was ordered was the Vico and Quattro Formaggi.  Vico was not bad.  This was a white pizza.  Enjoyed the fennel, onion, and sausage combination.  Mozzarella and mascarpone gave it a nice creaminess to the pizza.  The star of this visit was the Quattro Formaggi.  The pizza comes topped with four different cheeses.  What really made this pizza delicious was the Gorgonzola.  If you enjoy the sharp creamy flavor of Gorgonzola you have to order this.  As it is randomly dispersed on the pizza, the most enjoyable bites are the ones that include that sharp Gorgonzola taste.  This is the third time I've been here.  I have always been satisfied when coming here.  There are a lot of other pizza places in Vegas.  I would like to try other places but it is difficult to not come here because there pizzas are delicious.   Unless we do a pizza only visit to Vegas sometime.  Doubt that would happen."}
{"text":"Hands down the best service I've ever received in a restaurant. I love to go out to eat and I have also lived in Las Vegas for 6 years and have been to hundreds of places here. Our server was incredibly professional. She knew the menu completely, made some great suggestions, perfectly timed our appetizers, salads, and entrees, and really made our meal a great experience.   We were offered the private room in the back because it was just me and a lady friend, it was windowed with a glass door and very quiet. We were able to have nice conversation without having to talk over other patrons back there.   We ordered a misto plate which had. A variety of Italian meats, cheese, and grilled veggies with focaccia bread. The server suggested a salad with just greens, balsamic, and shaved Parmesan. Perfect! My friend ordered a mini margarita pizza because it was available at happy hour price at only $5! I ordered a 12\" full sized Diavola pizza because I was hungry.   The pizza was soft and fluffy. The salami was spicy but not overbearing. My server brought out some pepper flake infused olive oil to put on the pizza and it really added an extra kick.   On top of this, we each had a drink and our check came out under $50! Truly the best experience I've had anywhere here and it's a great place to take a date. Go there now!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza place in the valley hands down.  The food is always consistant and great.  Service is friendly and attentive without being too much.  Well priced and delicious.  Happy hour is a great deal.  I love sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian style pizza. Crispy super thin crust with very fresh ingredients.  This isn't New York style, Chicago style or generic American pizza, this is pizza napoletana which is different.  Just realize what your getting. I recommend the Capricciosa pizza which has crushed tomatoes, Prosciutto , Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil."}
{"text":"My family and I visit Settebello multiple times per week and have never had a bad experience. We have been in town for 9 months and have visited pizzerias throughout the US but this establishment has been one of the best, the food and staff never disappoint. We keep it simple usually sticking with the italian beer or lavazza coffee and an authentic margherita pizza with their incredible spicy olive oil.   The staff are always friendly and always prompt. They are not afraid to interact with anyone and definitely keep the atmosphere very upbeat and you are always greeted with a smile. The location is very convenient, right off the 215 with ample parking.   If you are looking for authentic Italian pizza please check them out but I must say that if you are expecting deep dish and hot wings you are in the wrong place. It would be like expecting authentic American southern style barbecue at a Chinese restaraunt. Come expecting Naples style pizza and you will not be disappointed. If you don't know what a neapolitan pizza is you might think it is undercooked, you'd be wrong, the staff is more happy to explain how the food is prepared if you are a first-timer.. These people might have reviews stating their last sushi experience was 1 star because the sushi was undercooked as well.   With pizza cooked at nearly a 1000 degrees in a hand built fire-brick oven, it is going to raise the temperature in the pizza shop but it has never been uncomfortable. The only time we sweat is if we sit outside in the summer or go overboard on the spicy oil and ground red peppers!   I have recommend this place to family and friends many times and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Pizza perfection! The products they serve at Pizza Hut, Domino's, etc shouldn't be allowed to be called \"pizza\" - this is what a pizza should be. Charred crust, crushed tomatoes (they taste so fresh) and fresh garlic, with an assortment of delicious meats and cheeses. It's a little sloppy, which I like - I always fold my slices in half, to avoid oil from the cheese dripping everywhere.  I've tried most of the top-rated pizza joints in town e.g. Pizza Rock, Grimaldi's, Secret Pizza and Settebello is comfortably my favourite"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. Ryan the server is very attentive and friendly. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"The pizza is terrific! Not like the standard pizza you get everywhere else, truly unique. There are amazing pizzas of the week that are interesting and delicious. The salads and appetizers are also so good. However the best thing is the bar, which has an awesome vibe. They make interesting cocktails, have a great rotating selection of craft beers, and probably some wine too. Kendra and the other bartenders will go out of their way to find good drinks that you are sure to enjoy. Definitively a good place to check out if you like quality food and great drinks."}
{"text":"The best place in town!  The food is amazing, and the the team of workers are the finest!! I highly recommend Settebello  Pizzeria Napoletana to everyone who wants an enjoyable atmosphere with fun people and the best pizza and wine in town!"}
{"text":"doesn't matter i what i order, i'm always happy!!!!!!! sooo good!!! i live on the other side and i dont care the drive!!!!"}
{"text":"I do not like their pizza, it was soggy, undercooked and really not good at all, oh and the salad was gross (how you mess that up is beyond me) I am a thin crust NY style pizza fan, and this was nothing like that,  not for me!"}
{"text":"I have been to Naples... The food here is authentic. The quality can not be beat.  Best pizza I have eaten in the U.S.A.   The services is excellent. Plus the specials offer some of the best value in Las Vegas.    To make a great experience even better, they use environmentally conscious take out packaging.  A wonderful experience all around.   Thank you."}
{"text":"It is Naples pizza done right. There is no insanity to hype up, they use great ingredients and make a specific type of pizza. The pizza and antipasti are all excellent. If you want simple quadro is great and don't get the pizza cut- that is part of the fun. You can taste the way it is made, some parts of it are \"Burnett\" and some doughy, but that's how a real pizza from a real pizza oven should be- and it's better that way.   The ambiance is solid, but after having begun to go to Dui Forni with its italian 60's-ish vibe, it loses a star in that department, but great Naples- style pizza, a must for the family or a casual night out."}
{"text":"I could rave about the pizza, but I'm going to start by complimenting the Web site.  The owner writes about apprenticing to a famous pizza maker in Italy, and then proceeds to tell you why Napoli-style pizza is distinct.  There's a great line on the site about how pizza crust should only use flour from one mill in Italy, and how the tomatoes are never made into sauce but simply crushed over the dough.  It's like Marcella Hazan's book, distilled into delicious bite-size web pages.  (If you have read her classic Italian cookbook, you know what I mean...)  The web site also identifies where their ingredients come from.  You're pretty hard-core when you're a pizzeria and your flour comes all the way from Italy.  In fact, when you walk into the door, there's a big stack of flour sacks right behind the host stand.  All of this would be so pretentious if the pizza weren't awesome.  And it is.  This is the closest thing I've had to the pizzas I enjoyed in Rome on vacation two years ago.  And for all the joking in this review about the flour, it really does make a difference.  The crust absorbs the flavor of the toppings but does not get soggy, and it's robust enough to stay in one piece until you cut it.  The only con is, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the price.  $13 for a pizza is pricey, but a plane ticket to Italy is at least $1,000, so I really don't think you can complain too much.  As a final thought, why is it that when an Italian politician says anything, you just let it go in one ear and out the other (see Berlusconi, Silvio for a modern example, or Craxi, Bettino for an earlier example -- corruption is really a bipartisan activity in Italy).  However, if an Italian chef says that the building blocks of your meal are imported from Italy and cooked in an oven hand-assembled from bricks that are also imported from Italy, there's no question he's telling the truth?"}
{"text":"You get the feeling that you are in Naples, Italy and just stopped in for a quick lunch or snack. The food quality is authentic and good. The service is a little sketchy. portion size is good. Full bar with a good selection of Italian wines. Both the pizza and the antipasto are noteworthy. Deserts are excellent as well. Definitely recommend and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We went on a trip to Naples, Italy a few years ago and fell in love with their pizza style, very unique.  When we visited Settebello for the first time, our memories of our trip came back, they are exactly the same, fresh ingredients, amazing dough, just perfect! I have to say that it is the best pizza, we absolutely love it!!!  And the service always outstanding, we will miss you guys!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I took ate here on a Sunday evening.  It was well worth the drive.  The quality of the ingredients are obviously excellent..  The thin crust is perfect.  The staff was attentive but not obtrusive in refilling drinks and answering any questions.  There was enough room for my 5 month old daughter's stroller.  Additionally, the gelato for desert was authentic.  It is an excellent idea to combine a trip to Valley Cheese and Wine which is nearby (walking distance). It is a good substitue for Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix (except I can skip the flight)."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh ingredients and it doesn't break the bank...hard to come by in Vegas.  :)"}
{"text":"This place serves authentic Italian pizza. I know because I used to live in Italy. By far the best restaurant pizza in the US that I have tasted! Well worth the drive every time."}
{"text":"We have been to Settebello many times both here in Henderson and in SLC. When we went tonight the service was not good - all of the servers seemed unhappy to be at work and weren't nice at all. The food was good. Inside it had to be at least 90 degrees - not sure if the air was broken or not. Needless to say it will be a long while before we go here again. Too bad because the food really is good."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at Settebello and the restaurant has not failed to impress my girlfriend and I. We both have this love for pizza and have been to many Pizzerias throughout CA, UT, AZ, NV, HI, and NY. We mutually agree that this restaurant is in our top 10.   Upon entering we were greeted by a group of very friendly staff who let us know that it would be a few minutes before we would be seated. Being that it was 6pm on a Friday night we were expecting to wait at least 10 minutes to be seated. It only took a few minutes. We decided to order the Bianca and the Settebello which only took about 6-8 minutes to make. Throughout the meal our waiter was very attentive and made sure our glasses were always full.   The food was great but our only complaint was that our pizza only had 4 tiny pieces of basil and when we asked if we can have extra they said they needed to charge us. They charged me an extra $1 for 4 extra pieces. My girlfriend works for a high end catering company and my brother works for a 4 star fine dining restaurant in the Wynn and never have we been charged or even questioned for something so small.   Anyways, the food is amazing and the service is equally great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves great brick oven pizza."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian pizza, served just like it is in Italy, or if you prefer they will slice it for you.   The Rucola is fantastic, although occasionally will have a touch too much salt, depends on the chef I suppose.   Sufficient variety of Italian beers and a full bar if you want more.   All desserts on the menu are worth saving room for.   They are also family friendly and generally reasonably priced."}
{"text":"five stars, that's it! If you want to have \"pizza\" as in, the true Italian pie with cheese on it, look no further. If you are looking for a deep dish crap most people call pizza, move right along. Fresh ingredients, nice sauce without spices (as it should be), fresh cheese, slightly burnt sides....just awesome. Like going to Italy without needing a passport. Best cappuccino in town (depending on who makes it tho), the tiramisu will get you tipsy, and the hazelnut gelato is great!"}
{"text":"Ronin's review made me want to try this place...so I did.  Now I can honestly say that I have experienced the world's perfect pizza!  Thin crust that's crispy and chewy at the same time, fresh and simple ingredients, and a slight smokiness to the crust makes this the best pizza I've ever had!  Settebello only sells pizzas and a few salads, and that's it. You won't find hot wings, cheezy garlic bread, stuffed crusts, dessert pizzas, fried chicken, or any of the (usually nasty) unnecessary non-pizza stuff here.  They make just a few things, and they do them RIGHT.  I had the Caprese, Margherita, and Quattro Stagioni, and was impressed with all of them!  It was so good, I ate the Caprese salad and a few pieces of pizza before I remembered to take pictures LOL!  Friendly service! My only complaint is that this place isn't closer to where I live!  My server was very friendly, and it was packed during lunch hour.  This place is truly a gem!   Update 2/1/07 I just had to go back!  The pizzas were perfect again.  The server was very friendly, and the guys in the kitchen had nothing but smiles on their faces. I love, Love, LOVE this place!  Do yourself a favor and check them out!   Update 3/4/07 Drove all the way from NLV again, so that DH could try Settebello's awesome pizza!  I was a little disappointed this time around, the pizzas were soggy and not hot, as if they were sitting on the pass for too long.  The server that was there wasn't nearly as friendly as the weekday server.  As we were leaving, there were two hot pizzas on plates, ready to be served to the tables, but they were sitting there for at least a couple minutes because the server was busy.  The pizzas were still good, but would've been better if they were given to us before they became soggy and lukewarm."}
{"text":"A very unpretentious restaurant, with a casual and comfortable ambience. The decor does have a slight European flair to it, but not in an overpowering way.    The menu is simple, with about 10 or so pizzas listed, some antipasti and not a whole lot more. The level of service is excellent, bordering on exceptional. Our server was Ryan, and he was well-assisted by the rest of the staff.  Ryan was very well-informed about his menu, understood instantly what we were shooting for - one white and one tomato pizza to share - and guided us to very good and complementary choices.  Service was fast and attentive - drink refills always appeared just a few minutes BEFORE glasses ran empty - and the food came out quickly, fresh and hot.  Napoli pizza is rather different than the American version, so comparing the two is a little like comparing apples and oranges. I'd eaten pizza a few times in Italy, and new what to expect.  And I was not disappointed. The ingredients - prosciutto, spinach, cheeses - were all fresh and delicious.   Ryan, and then later the busboy, made some recommendations - such as dipping the pizza in a balsamic reduction - that impressed us greatly.    Price for two, was just under $50.  On the whole, we were very impressed.  We will recommend this restaurant to friends and almost certainly visit again."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is, BY FAR, my favorite pizza I have ever had. I've never been to Italy but its what I would imagine pizza in Napoli is like. Every time I eat there I think of the movie Eat, Pray, Love when she can't stop eating the Pizza in Napoli because is just so good.  The atmosphere is comfortable - great for a date night or a night out with the family. Love this place. Its one of my favs!"}
{"text":"Excellent Atmosphere , Service and Quality of food .  Great menu and attentive service from start to finish . Energy was intimate and warm . Highly recommend ."}
{"text":"Hands down beats any pie in LV metro. Yes that means you too not so secret pizza and Tony's etc. Superb service also and they don't beat your ass with some overpriced dBag Anthony Bourdain dumpster fire of Kraft veggies and boutique beers and cocktails. Pizza made to order, big enuff for 2...OK, 1 if you are starving like I was when I flew in from Dallas, rented car, drive here and ATE 2 PIES! Did share 1 with wife but almost downed 1.5 pizzas myself and it was awesome awesome awesome. Best bang for pizza buck in 5 counties. Server gal was knowledgeable about pie and Napolitano pie specifically. She is beautiful and smart and nice and quick with the grub!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Service is good. First time was good.They brought out yummy breadsticks. Must have forgotten the second time. Second time pizza was a bit soggy. Not good. Salad good both times.Prob won't go back :("}
{"text":"Great pizza this one is better than the other one in Pasadena wish this one was in California."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great pizza, great authentic rustic Italian food. My favorite pizza is the Diavolo, nice and spicy. The decor is simple urban casual  The best part, the service. Matt and Trisha were just so nice, humble people that know what they're doing behind the bar.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to have pizza. My favorite is the Emilia. I always sub the cotto for crudo because cotto is more like ham to me and crudo is more of a thinner and cured."}
{"text":"I have never been so irritated in my life.. The crust is soft and soggy on the inside and totally black and burns around the edges how can you even sell that!!"}
{"text":"Pizza reviews, in my opinion, should be separated by catagory/type of pizza. Chicago style, Cali style, NY style, chain, Napoli style, etc. All potentially delicious, but with very different and crucial characteristics.   Settebello is Napoli style at its best! Brick, wood fired oven, thin stretchy crust....*drool* sorry! I try to attempt to switch it up and try all their different pies. It helps when the whole family goes so I can try someone else's as I'm addicted to the Bianca... prosciutto crudo, parm, mozz, olive oil topped with fresh arugola that wilts slightly from the heat of the pie. Man, it's good! But I have managed to order others, and here's a few stand-outs for me: the Diavalo, crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell peppers, red pepper flakes, garlic, mozz and olive oil. The Capricciosa, crushed tomatoes, prosciutto cotto, artichoke hearts, roasted 'shrooms, olives, mozz and basil. In truth, my family has tried most of the menu and likes it all. A big favorite of ours is their Insalada Grande. For my youngest, my husband and myself, it is our absolute favorite go-to salad in town. The vinaigrette is perfect and it is never over dressed. My oldest likes it as well, but excruciatingly picks out the artichoke hearts (hates the pickled ones), purple leaves (grrrrr) and the parm shavings...all of which her younger sis is more than happy to take off her hands.  We go at least once a month, sometimes more. Last, but not least, for heaven's sake get yourself a cappuccino!!!  It's Illy, and it's bloody perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is real Napoli pizza fresh and authentic. Excellent hard to find Italian cocktails too.  Service is very good and the price is reasonable.  Nice to see something like this in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Always five star tastes here. The bubbling cheese and crisps edges from the 900 degree oven makes this the most desirable pizza by our family."}
{"text":"We are here for our forth time. Reasonable prices, authentic brick-oven style pizza, quiet setting and very personable staff. Location in Village square is near enough to come here once in awhile. Italian at its best."}
{"text":"Great pizza and customer service.  I really like the Diavola. Love the big wood tables."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I went on Friday night ....we were a party of three.  Had to wait....they were packed.  Friendly staff.  Great waitress...really nice and seemed to enjoy her job.    We ordered the warm beet salad and three pizzas.  I had the Rafael....out of this world...best pizza I have ever had in this town.   My friends were happy with their pizzas too.   There were lots of families...and kids...so it's not a quiet place.    Great food and great prices.  Very fair.  Loved the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Best pizza! Every time I am in Las Vegas I make a trip to come here. The settebello pizza and the diavola pizza are both amazing. Such a great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. Simple menu of pizza and salad. Wonderful."}
{"text":"Had the marguerite pizza was terrific.Everyone very pleasant and prices very fair.So much better than Grimaldis for quality and price.0"}
{"text":"Service is excellent! Waiter was very knowledgeable and was not pushy. Restaurant was casual, but intimate. Pizza are about personal.size, but shareable if you were not too hungry. Tried the Margareta pizza and my bf tried the Settabello signature pizza. Both were good. Waiter did inform us the style of pizza was a thinner crust baked at 1,000 degrees so the middle would be a little \"wet\". Different, but good. Had a latte at the end. Would come back again. Definitely would recommend?."}
{"text":"Imagine my suprise when on a business trip to Las Vegas a few months ago I discovered there was a Neapolitan pizzeria owned by a former USC QB.  Being both a pizza and USC fanatic I could not resist. I arrived to the pizzeria across the street from the Cheescake Factory in Henderson and was happy to see the place packed.  I choose to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table and enjoyed a few Italian cocktails.   I decided to go simple and just ordered the classic margherita with buffalo milk mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil.  I have lived in Southern Italy and have been to Napoli a number of times and can tell you what I ate at Settebello is an exact replica of the flavors and textures I remember.   I have traveled across this country quite a bit and always go out of my way to try different pizzerias, so far this is the best pizza I have ever had in the US. Service was great and I talked the bartenders ear off for about an hour and a half.  Luckily I go to Las Vegas about once a month for business, Settebello will be on my new must eat list each time I visit."}
{"text":"Very nice setting with helpful, attentive wait staff.  My wife loved their pizza (very authentic Napolitano style from what I remember from our trips to Italy).  The tiramisu was also good."}
{"text":"We always order a salad with a margherita pizza. Can't go wrong there! Service is good (though we go early so we are usually the only one's there) and the food is superb!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in Henderson/Vegas if you like \"wet\" pizza (pizza Napoletana).  I love their Quattro Formaggi pizza; the Gorgonzola on it is a special treat.  Only the finest ingredients are used, especially in regard to the Misto appetizer (a sampling of Italian style meats, vegetables and cheese served with focaccia).  The menu is sufficient in size, but focuses mainly on pizzas (no pasta etc.). Daily/weekly specials do add more variety (these are not posted on the website/menu).  The service however, leaves something to be desired. The wait staff is courteous, but lacks enthusiasm, speed, and the cultural/culinary knowledge I expect when dining at such an authentic restaurant."}
{"text":"As a member of an organization called Vera Pizza Napoletana, Settebello follows a set of standards designed to ensure the quality of their signature dish. These standards include working with high-quality ingredients, following an established recipe that includes hand-rolling, and cooking in a real wood-fired oven. The result is pizza that tastes far better than the doughy, sauce-smothered, greasy mess covered with rubbery cheese-substitute that is served in most pizza joints. Like the organization's name says, this is \"True Neapolitan Pizza,\" as Otton himself trained as a pizzaiolo in Italy for 3 years before opening Settebello.  And the pizza at Settebello is sublime -- especially their signature pizza, the Margherita. The crust is thin, chewy, and full of rich, wheaty flavor. The layer of crushed tomato actually tastes like fresh tomatoes with a hint of olive oil. And the mozzarella cheese and fresh basil are perfectly proportioned to complement the pizza without overpowering it. It's pizza you can eat and still feel good about afterwards.  As good as it is, Settebello isn't just about the pizza. Their commitment to quality extends to their entire menu. Their focus on fresh, high-quality ingredients makes for really amazing salads. They don't just pull some roughage out of a bag and pour some dressing over it. At Settebello, they lovingly construct their salads by hand, and it shows, with perfect proportions that create a nice mix of flavors.  My favorite salad is the Insalata Grande, which combines roasted mushrooms, marinated artichokes hearts, pine nuts, kalamata olives, flakes of parmigiano-reggiano, fresh tomatoes, mixed greens and balsamic vinaigrette. The peppery crunch of the greens melds wonderfully with the tangy chewiness of the mushrooms & artichokes, with the tomatoes, nuts & cheese adding nice counterpoints. It's such a fulfilling experience that I've often ordered it as a meal in itself.  I'm no pizza purist. I'm willing to believe in the possibility of good pizza that doesn't follow the tenets of Vera Pizza Napoletana. What matters to me is the final product. Does it taste good? Is it satisfying? Settebello succeeds on both counts, in ways that have kept me coming back again and again.  Also, the service at Settebello is always excellent, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Only rated 3 stars because we've had better pizza and caprese salad at a nearby pizzeria. Even the extra crispy crust couldn't save this pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent wood-fired pizza and reasonably priced! In a great location too! It's fun to walk off the pizza in the beautiful district after :)"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  Great cocktail options.  We had the pizza bolognese, the crust was really tasty and overall the pizza was not greasy (which we prefer).  We had a few of their specialty cocktails, and I am not a whiskey drinker, but the \"tea\" drink they have is fantastic, super smooth, whiskey taste mild. It is chamomile infused vodka with some other things poured atop chamomile infused whipped cream in a champagne glass - presents well and taste yummy.   Spouse didn't want to try the pear and jalapeño pizza, but I will be back to check that out."}
{"text":"This place is amongst the best pizza joints in the Las Vegas area.  If you're looking for authentic Neapolitan style pizza, this place really can't be beat.  Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of their pizza is the mozzarella cheese -- it is unbelievably fresh.  To demonstrate this point, I suggest you order the caprese salad, which includes freshly sliced rounds of their buffalo mozzarella.  The cheese simply melts as you place it on your tongue - soft, creamy and rich.   I have yet to find better cheese anywhere else.  I was in Venice, Italy on vacation about a year ago and, while I searched the city for a pizzeria that could rival the flavor and quality of Settebello, I was completely unable to find any serious competitors.  It's the truth, Settebello's pizza is actually better than any pizza that I found in Venice."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have our family dinner and decided on this restaurant based upon its ranking. The high marks are deserved. The atmosphere, the delicious pizzas, service, and price was superb. Get the warm beet salad - probably the best beet dish I've had."}
{"text":"Great location in the district, pizza is good like the east coast.  It's not cheap especialy,  if you like wine."}
{"text":"I planned on staying away from pizza in Vegas, but Settebello made me very glad I changed my mind.     The prosciutto with the appetizer was great, not overly salty or tough. The pizzas were very tasty with a thin crust that was crispy but soft inside, even topping distribution, and fresh tasting sauce. The beer offerings were a pleasant surprise, with several imported Italian micro-brews. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"RATING: B +  SERVICE: B -  AMBIANCE: A  OVERVIEW: Overall the food was delicious, and the ambience is like no other. Definitely a great spot to take someone to dinner. Has a cozy feel to it. The Settebello pizza is something to look out for in the menu. Packed with amazing flavors, and to top it off it was very filling."}
{"text":"i dig this place.  i love just tearing up the pizza like they do in italy.  the pizza was great...not at all greasy.  the servers are quick with the refills too.    i went there with a friend and the atmosphere seemed kind of dead though.  it's nice and clean...but i feel like they need to liven it up a bit."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and salads.  The Bianca is the only Pizza I've tried here because its so amazing, I don't want anything else.  Would give 5 stars if they had a decent wine list!"}
{"text":"I am not a big yelper, BUT I do believe good service should be recognized! I popped in to Settebello today for a quick lunch. Charlene greeted me at the door, and seated me.  She went over the menu with me in great detail, and was extremely informed! It's great when the staff is knowledgeable and also willing to walk you through the experience! I feel in some establishments customer service is a dying thing. Not here! Charlene was kind, funny, and constantly on top of things!  Did I mention their pizza rocks?!  What more could you ask for?!   Thanks Charlene and Settebello! I WILL  be back!"}
{"text":"I really love their pizzas! I especially love the Diavola and Settebello pizzas. I want to be honest here. Their pizza is like an orgasm in your mouth! I always get good service from their staff. I would also like to recommend the Tiramisu. The only reason that I didn't give it a full five stars, is because I just wished they had different sizes for the pizza instead of just one. I just want to have MAN-SERVINGS when it comes to food. Otherwise, please visit this establishment when you get a chance."}
{"text":"Searched for top pizza places in Vegas but didn't see this one on the list, which was surprising. The pizza was classic Neapolitan. Soft and chewy interior crust and light and crisper edges. Good selections, nice atmosphere and great service. Put this on your list if you're  on the west side of town."}
{"text":"Really good wood-fired pizza, competes with Pizzeria Bianco (compared within the same week). But go for the Settebello, it's their best option (we ordered 4 different pies and all agreed this was their best)."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice but the food was mediocre. The insalata grande was delicious but I was disappointed with the pizza. The toppings were scarce and we ordered 3 different pizzas which tasted exactly the same. Although the dough was delicious it was very floppy that you couldn't really eat with your hands. There was really difference in flavor for the 3 pizzas we chose. It's an okay place but probably wouldn't recommend it. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I like their pizza. It's pretty authentic the way they make their crust and sauce (or don't sauce) the crust.  The reason I give only three stars is because of the toppings. Sometimes the freshness isn't there. For a restaurant that's so close to whole foods, their toppings better be fresh. Otherwise, I'll just go to whole foods and buy the stuff to make my own pizza at home. Of course, then it wouldn't be made in a brick oven, the ingredients would be fresh though!  I like the pizza with arugula on top. The last few times I've been, the pizza was overly oily -which either means they put too much olive oil on or they put too much cheese on while the pizza was just out of the oven- and the arugula was sad looking. Almost like the pizza was made earlier and they reheated it.  Then there are other times I go and the pizza is great!   I think they need a bigger and better appetizer or primi menu. They also need more Italian liquor and Italian wine. Hey, they want to be authentic, don't they?"}
{"text":"We were looking to pick up a delicious early dinner to take home. My boyfriend and I called settebello and ordered a order of caprese and the person over phone recommended the settebello pizza. The pizza and caprese were both very good. I am glad we decided to stop there. Mitch was very kind and willing to help over the phone."}
{"text":"Had an awesome late lunch delicious pizza, cozy place. Ordered charcuterie plater good wine selections. Food was on point!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight.  The other yelp reviews are accurate.  The flavor of the pizza is delicious the sauce and toppings. I enjoyed it but the crust is thin which I like. But it is soggy and doughy when u pick it up everything slides write off. My favorite thing was the insulate salad fresh green pine nuts parm cheese olives it's very tasty. They have this amazing non alcohol ginger beer and it is so yummy. I had a coast land blond on tap beer also great. I don't think I would go back very often for this pizza :( sadly the crust is too soggy. Great customer service!!!!!!! But about 8:30 they start to rush u out and gave us our check before we finished our pizza and my beer"}
{"text":"This is real Wood burning oven Pizza, not a gas fired Fake pizza oven that the brand name is \"wood-burning\", The guy puts wood in the oven and burns it.  No thermostat, or controls. Just his skill. And the pizza is cooked perfect. the sauce is fresh, and the garlic doesn't come out of a jar.  Yes I can taste the difference.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the fact that I like a great champagne with my wood fired Pizza, none here."}
{"text":"Good: Hostess was nice, pizza came out fast, good flavors  Bad:  Consistency: clearly I'm in the minority here in my opinion of this place but I don't like my pizza soggy. I've enjoyed some thin crust that I have to fold but this shit is ridiculous. It was a race to get the damn thing to my mouth before it all fell off. (The pizza won btw)  Quality: I ordered panchetta on my Diavlo and they gave me fatty slices of American bacon. I'm not an idiot, I know the difference between panchetta and regular cut bacon. If you're out just say so and give me my $2.50 back.  Cost: After tipping the hostess who took my order + the extra for the \"panbacon\" I spent $20 bucks for 4 slices of mush.   I am open to trying their salads but I will never order a pizza from them again or recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is my go to when I'm craving pizza! They have awesome happy hour deals and their cocktails are AMAZING. Never disappoint. When we go we normally get a couple of the meat and cheese platters for the table (they do have a happy hour deal for $5 that gives you a good selection and just enough for 2) we also always get the buffalo mozzarella and jalapeno pear marmalade for the side - so worth the extra $$ - SO DELICIOUS. When it comes to pizza though we never get the same thing twice because everything is so good! They have unique toppings that just work. Everything down to the focaccia bread at this place is to die for!  The only thing I could even try to say negative is sometimes they run out of their infused oil :( its so good!!! I normally dip the pizza crust and focaccia in it!"}
{"text":"Ate at settebello last night for my second time. Good pizzas but too long of a wait and service was so so.  My pizza crust was partially burnt. Better experience last time."}
{"text":"Not happy, called a hour before asking if they had the $5 pizza (Margherita) and was told yes and asked if they had it To go, I was told yes, I then drive up to this location and I'm told that the $5 is not until after 6:30pm, but they do have the happy hour one for $5 but it is not to go and it's half the size. Well I was not told any of this on the phone, if I was aware of this, I wouldn't have drove up there just for the pizza. I made sure to call because we had this same $5 all day Margherita pizza at the one In Oxnard, CA so this is why I double checked if they had the same thing going on here. Very disappointed. I believe the person I spoke with was Carla: the communication needs to be a Lil better. I was not about to wait a hour to get this pizza. And another yelper even stated they had the $5 all day Margherita pizza at this location. Very irritated and not happy. Had it not been for this, they would receive 5 stars. All I got was a sorry. :("}
{"text":"Margherita  9.99 Crushed tomatoes, Parmigiano-Reggiano, basil, mozzarella and extra virgin olive oil.  I ordered mine Con Pancetta.  My server was wonderful, I believe his name was Jack, and he figured out that I was a first timer and gave me the details on Napoletana Pizza.  I ordered mine uncut so I could eat it like the Italians!    The crushed tomatoes were perfect.  The basil was perfect.  The mozzarella was SO AMAZINGLY GOOD.  The crust was perfect.  The pancetta was just a bit rubbery, I was hoping it would get toasted up in the oven.  Overall this was a REALLY good pizza and I would come back, but stick with the plain Margherita.  And I'd bring a friend so I can try the Caprese salad.  This pizza wouldn't take home - definitely eat it fresh.    Never having had this style of pizza, I really have nothing to compare it to.  I would recommend that you come with an open mind - it is what it is.  It is NOT NY pizza."}
{"text":"I've been to Southern Italy a number of times, and the food here is just as good!  I'd never had a pizza in the states that was comparable until dining here.  The apps were divine, too!  Must come back!"}
{"text":"I was pumped about finding  Settebello and getting to eat there after reading the Las Vegas Weekly's year in awards and this placed finished in front of my favorite, Metro Pizza. To me, there was mininal amount on my pizza and was not a tasty as at least 3 other establishments (Metro, Home Plate, and even Roadrunner's chains of establishments seemed to outclass Settbello. Maybe it was an off night but I think I will stick with Metro and Home Plate before shelling out money for an overpriced product."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian style pizza at a reasonable price. Atmosphere maybe leaves a little to be desired but I would go again for the delicious pizza.  Nice for something a lil different."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday at about 1:30 pm. For a light lunch, my wife and I each had the green salad and split a Pizza Bolognese. The shaved parmesan on the salad was excellent. The pizza was also very good. Sauce was tomato sweet and mozzarella was fresh. I thought the crust was slightly salty and very slightly undercooked however. Service was very good. The atmosphere was calm and quiet. All in all a nice experience. My only complaint is this: this style of pizza, while very tasty, is not filling."}
{"text":"Always great pizza and service. Margarita is classic and they mastered it. If you like it spicier, diavola is for you!"}
{"text":"One of the nice things about running a half marathon is that afterwards, you can eat anything you want. So after burning what I tell myself must have been AT LEAST a million and a half calories in the Rock 'n' Roll, I told my parentals that it was critical we get pizza. Serious. Crucial. Muy importante.   We rolled in to the new location of Settebello and the place is an Instagrammer's dream. It has a very refined, elegant feel to it that does not exude \"pizzeria\" in the slightest bit. Tons of #nofilter #woodwork #crafty #ilovepizza #canyoubelievethisisapizzaplace #noireallycant going on.   La noche began with fried risotto, which were ravioli-like envelopes of breaded risotto, and a beet salad with creamy goat cheese and nuts. I think the risotto could have stood on its own without making a detour to the fryer, but the salad was a fresh complement to the pizza.   The Family K opted for the Vico (sausage, fennel, onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil) and Capriccioso (all vegetables - don't even bother if you're a carnivore), and the final tally had Vico in the lead. We were advised in advance that the thin-crust pizzas come out slightly charred, but the crust on our Capriccioso was just burnt, which is why it was Michelle Kwan that night and not Tara Lipinski. We learned that night that crushed tomato is OKAYYY but we don't love it. Since Settebello has so many options without crushed tomatoes though, I'm sure we will be back again sometime to peruse the other items on the menu.   #nexttimeiwonthavejustrunahalfmarathonthoughughhh"}
{"text":"Solid pizzas, salads, and beers. The pizzas are Neopolitan style so feel very rustic. Definitely feels a bit fresher than your normal pizzeria.   Crusts were slightly undercooked in our opinion, but next time we'll ask for them to leave it in an extra minute. We like crispier crusts, so this could just be us.  The beet salad was incredible: roasted beets, goat cheese, marcona almonds, arugula, balsamic vinaigrette. Delicious.  The pizza settebello (crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, olio) was awesome, though consensus was that pignoli were out of place.  And our glasses weren't empty when we left, so they brought us to-go cups for the iced tea and topped them off. Really nice touch. Would be in the rotation for sure if we spent more time near GVR."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here during our lunch break probably once a week. I was off with my wife for New Years, and I took her here for lunch yesterday. She had never been to Settebello and I had always told her how good the pizza was.   It didn't seem too crowded and we were greeted by the same server named Adam, I believe. He is always very friendly and even acknowledged that I was there with my wife and not my coworkers. It's very nice to feel remembered.   I always get the margarita pizza, but my wife insisted we get a salad, too. She choose the insalada grande. I'm not much of a salad person, but it was very good. The food here is just so fresh tasting. Every time I have eaten here I can taste how fresh my pizza is, and in this case the salad, too.   When we had finished Adam suggested dessert. I had never had any here and my wife loves chocolate, so Adam suggested the zeppoles. Simply amazing.   I really wanted to write this review because I was nervous of disappointing my wife about the lunch place I had talked up so much. But, like always amazing food and spot on service."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about the place, my friend and I went on a Monday night to try out their handcrafted pizzas. The interior is very beautiful for a pizza place, I like that you can see the pizza oven in the back of the restaurant. When we walked in, there was no one to greet/seat us, even though the restaurant was barely half full. We stood there for a few minutes before a server acknowledged us and yelled to a girl standing by the pizza oven chatting to the cook. That's when I realized she was suppose to be the hostess, but she obviously thought talking to the cook was more important. Moments before, a large group had entered the restaurant and stood behind us, and the hostess ignored me and my friend and immediately spoke to the guy behind me and asked if they had a reservation. Perhaps she thought we were all one party, but I thought that was pretty rude of her not to ask.   When we were finally seated, we were unable to get menus right away because they had run out. How do you run out of menus on a Monday night when it's not busy? I'm sure the Office Depot down the street can make color copies at $0.25 each...  Aside from that, our pizzas were pretty good. I'm not a big fan of pizzas, but I love the crispiness of the crust and how you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I had the Vico, which was basically a white pizza with no tomatoes, and it was surprisingly very filling despite it being a very thin-crust pizza.  Long story short - good food, subpar service."}
{"text":"Cool decor, the service wasn't really good for start we order just water and soda but my friend ordered a beer in a wine glass (she is very picky) our server said there was a problem with the beer and he will get as soon as possible. About 10 minutes later we forgot who our server was. Finally the beer came but not in a bear glass not a wine glass. The food made up for that though it was really fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Ate here on Sunday after browsing around Valley Cheese & Wine. I really like this place and I can't wait to go back to have another margherita pizza...except next time i'll ask for extra basil."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants!  We love the Caprese Salad, the fresh tomatoes and mozzarella are wonderful to start the meal with.  I love the Diavola (spicy and so tasty), Capricciosa (savory with the veggies) pizzas, and the Misto (shaved meats, cheeses, olives, marinated zucchini and focaccia), could only be improved would be to added a few grapes and some sliced tart apple.  Husband's favorites are the Settebello and the Margherita w/ Calabrese and mushrooms pizzas.  It can be a bit busy and crowded but the staff tries to keep everything moving along as quick as they can.  Its not really a restaurant for kids but people seem to want to bring them here anyway. :-S"}
{"text":"Nice people, knowledgable bar tender and a good selection of Italian beers beyond the usual Peroni and Moretti. The Insalata Grande someone else on here raved about was really good. I also ordered a Settebello pizza for take-out. The pizza was good, though I would have prefered it to have been cooked a bit more. By the time I got it back to my house, the crust was soggy which distracted from the overall appeal. Overall a restaurant worth visiting."}
{"text":"1/2/16 This is now one  of my top three favorite pizza places.   Pear and Jalapeño pizza is my new favorite pizza.   Our friends thought it might be too hot for me,  but it was the perfect amount of heat from the Jalapeño.   The crust was thin and perfectly seasoned,  I could eat the crust by itself.   We also ordered the settebello pizza,  but I preferred the pear & jalapeño pizza."}
{"text":"Went this week with a friend who visited the Salt Lake City location and fell in love with the pizza.  Really surprised myself with the fact that a place that sells 95% pizza and not much else besides salads that I found another good lunch location.  Okay, I'll have a salad with that pizza.  Really good as I did not expect it to overwhelm my taste buds.  But it did!  I think it was the freshly shave parm cheese.  And then came the pizza which was extremely tasty.  I had the marguarita with sausage.   Good atmosphere but a little pricey for a pizza.  Will probably return but need to be in a good mood to want to spend for a fancy, trendy pizza style."}
{"text":"Was very disappointing in this place. I ordered one of the white pizzas and it was flavorless. The risotto balls and salad were just ok. Service was extremely slow. My waitress took my glass of water to fill and never returned it. I noticed other customers coming in, and then leaving because they were never attended to."}
{"text":"This is the  second time my boyfriend and I have been here and needless to say they have not disappointed. Their food is amazing and they're always so kind. Tonight we took our friend from out of town here and, again, they did not disappoint. However, their Internet was down which meant they could not accept credit cards. After waiting a bit while (the manager?) was on the phone with their company trying to get it back up, the man came over to us and handed us a new bill, apologized for the inconvenience, and told us to have a good night. Confused, I looked at the bill and they completely compt our meal. I absolutely appreciate the gesture and working at a high end nail salon I understand when frustrations happen to where you comp a service.. I've been on that side and I understand the personal feeling of being upset that a customer would be annoyed with you for something out if your control. Needless to say, we absolutely love this place, will always pay for our meals even if they show their kindness in paying for the meal themselves, and will be a long time customer. You guys, as I've said, do not disappoint. Thank you so much for always a great experience."}
{"text":"Tried Settebello for the first time last night. Here's my disclaimer... I do enjoy bland foods. We ordered both the Insalata Grande and the Beet Salad.  Overall I enjoyed the beet salad more due to the dressing and the wonderful flavors. I found the Insalata Grande bland and boring. I loved the portion sizes as they were quite large, enough for two to share one salad.   I liked the fact that they offer several pizzas without a tomato base. The pizzas are 12 inches round and enough to fill up two people with a decent appetite We ordered the Vena pizza which we enjoyed. We added the arugula from the salads on top of the pizza which made it more flavorful.  I would like to return in the near future and try some of their other pizzas!"}
{"text":"Place is amazing !! Great food ! Great wine !  Great decor ! Definitely recommend the Cesar salad and house red wine !"}
{"text":"Amazing Napolitano style pizza. The ingredients and flavors are top notch. I have been a customer for years and I always come back for more. The only minus are the poorer dessert options compared to few years ago and the unavailability of craft beers. Food 44 Service 22 Decor 15 Total 81/100"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant given the high reviews and were disappointed.  Both my wife and I ordered the Settebello.  She substituted the Buffalo mozzarella and I added anchovies.  The food came out quickly (too quickly).  On the good side, the toppings were extremely good although the pancetta was undercooked.  On the bad side, the crust had little flavor, was over charred on the bottom and severely gummy in the center.  The waiter told us that this was standard for Neapolitan pizza, but I've had food in many Neapolitan restaurants and this is just not true.  The oven obviously was too hot and the pizza needed to cook more slowly.  They also need a more flavorful recipe for the dough.  In addition, we asked for parmesan cheese and what came out was the terrible Kraft type parmesan that had little flavor.  It doesn't cost that much to get real parmesan cheese and grate it at the table or right before.  Add to that, the diet coke I had did not have adequate carbonation.  The place was clean and the tables were nice but there is virtually no sound deadening and it is very noisy. The waiter was very nice, however, but you come to a restaurant for the food.  Perhaps we just got a bad meal, but we won't be going back very soon."}
{"text":"This place is good, don't get me wrong. I love this Italian style pizza, the service was good, and i enjoyed my meal. The thing is, if you go a few blocks over to eastern there is Grimaldi's pizza, which is that same Italian style pizza, but its just much better. The pizza was a bit cold and soft, so maybe mine was just undercooked, i dont know. Also the flavors were a little bland. So try this and you wont be too disapointed, but missing out on Grimaldi's would be the crime when its so close."}
{"text":"Would have to say this is my favorite pizza place, forget any of the chain pizza places, setebellos is the place to go. I enjoy going to setebellos on the days I crave pizza. My favorite pizza to get is the bolognese pizza. No specific reason except that it matches my taste buds really well. While it can get crowded every now and again I still enjoy it every time as the pizza is always worth it!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best pizza in the district and possibly in Vegas. My State Farm Agency is right across the street so I regularly visit them for lunch with my office staff. Great staff, great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Margherita Napoleon was perfect! Get the buffalo mozzarella instead of regular mozzarella, worth the extra few dollars. The atmosphere was good and so was the staff. Big TV in the bar area and a good spot to grab a bite of you as traveling for work as I was.   Don't forget the affogato dessert with hazelnut gelato..."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and an absolutely stellar drink selection. Beautifully crafted and unique."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in Vegas. Just like the Italian one. Very friendly and nice staff. Very good happy hour and every Monday you can eat a regular Margherita for just 5$! And try Zeppole with Nutella as dessert! To die for!!!"}
{"text":"Best neapolitan pizza in the  country.If you like real italian pizza baked in an oven from italy which runs at around 900 Degrees F.this is the place. If you like american pizza with 10 toppings DO NOT COME HERE,this place has super thin pizza.Only get 1-2 toppings,you dont need more. BTW great tiramisu."}
{"text":"Excellent. I had the Margherita pizza and added arugula and caramelized onions.  I couldn't detect any basil on my pizza, but other than that it was fabulous.  Perfect crust - chewy & well-toasted. The salads are amazing - can't beat the prices and they don't skimp on the goodies. Dessert.  For $5 you can get a Nutella pizza with fresh bananas and slivered almonds.  It's the same size as their entree pizzas - about 12\".  And I think they apply the Nutella with a squeeze bottle.  It's beautiful - a grid of thin lines over the whole pizza, edge to edge.  The bananas are put on while the crust is still hot so they soften a bit but don't get mushy.  I've had Nutella dessert pizzas all over the country & this one is the best so far. You could go the the Strip and pay a LOT more for a similar meal but it won't come close the the quality & authenticity of this comfortable place."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! We have yet to have a meal that disappoints.  Try the Vico - I usually add mushrooms! My wife will usually order the pizza of the day. The panzanella salad is a must, dressed in a super tangy lemon vinaigrette. All ingredients are fresh and top of the line. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"We have been to Settebello on multiple occasions.  The first of which was a great overall experience except for the rude hostess, who was to busy gossiping to greet or bid is farewell. I had written the place off but my girlfriend convinced me to try it again and we have been back many times. So find a new hostess Settebello!!  Anyway this evening our server was Matt, who was fantastic! He have is the best service we have had there this far. We started with two salads, the caprese and the Pere de prosciutto salad. All the salads have been incredible there! The panzanella and caprese are my favorites. We also had there special pizza of the week, which had walnuts, bacon, maple vinaigrette and pears. It was the perfect combination of sweet and salty! It was the best pizza I have ever had!   I'm glad I have settebello another try, I am a huge fan!"}
{"text":"Vreat food and service.  Moderate price but well worth it.  Margarita pizza is my favorite."}
{"text":"I have not had pizza like this since my trips to Bermuda. Bermuda has all these little mom and pop trattorias with amazing old world Italian. I was quickly addicted to their fresh Napoletana pizza. Settebello has awakened that addiction in me with their amazing pizza.  I started with a bottle of Italian beer, which was great. Settebello has a great selection of Italian micro brews. For pizza I went with the Settebello, because in my opinion if a dish is named after the restaurant's namesake it has to be good. Well my theory proved correct still. The Settebello didn't let me down. The ingredients were fresh and the pizza crust was perfect.  I will be feeding my addiction again soon."}
{"text":"Pizza with a twist......and a full bar! Mauriccio from Italia has has the perfect hand for making these pizzas. And the fresh squeezed oj mimosas.....on point"}
{"text":"Pizza was tasty but soupy. It had a great amount of flavor but sort of just slipped off the dough. The salads might have been better than the pizza overall. Both of the salad I add (Caprese, Rucola) were both light and delicous. The atmosphere was nice and the service was friendly and attentive. It was good quality but was expecting more from so many 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"My wife and i had the pizza mela e asiago. The foods amazing and service is quick and friendly. We love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I drove 22 miles across town to check this place out, after reading all the glowing reviews here on Yelp.  We started with the misto appetizer, which consists of slices of very fresh and excellent Italian coldcuts (salami, proscuitto, mortadella) , cheese, olives, mushrooms and foccacia bread.   It was really good.  Next, husband ordered the capricciosa and I ordered the settebello pizza.  We've been to Napoli so we knew what a Napoletana pizza should taste like (and this is what Settebello promises to deliver).  The pizza here was very good - correct thin flexible crust with a few blackened spots, foldable as it should be.  The toppings were much better than at the majority of pizzarias here in town (especially flavorful was the sausage on my pie).  But did this blow us away?  Sadly not.    That's why I'm giving it only four stars.  However, we ended the meal with the tiramisu, and that was one of the best  I have ever had anywhere!   Another point in their favor were the prices - the most expensive pizza was only $13.50.   In sum, it was a close and very good try, and we would go back again.  But we're still waiting for that blow your socks off pizza moment here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Real Italian pizza (Naples style. Other places in Italy make it thinner and more crusty).   The quality of ingredients is unbelievable (the prosciutto is so sweet, Parma style, the tasty mozzarella, the fresh tomatoes). They size of the pizza could be bigger.  The service? Great! Same as food. Mariana was so nice and kind. She made our evening so comfortable and enjoyable. We really appreciated her.   The price is ok considering the quality."}
{"text":"Great lunch or dinner spot, they mastered pizza satisfaction. This place caters to those who can distinguish between the cookie-cutter pizza places and those who want freshly baked, handmade, and quality ingredients type of pizza ...that makes you close your eyes with each bite and think you're in Italy."}
{"text":"I've eaten at other locations and fell in love with their food. I wanted to get together with some coworkers for happy hour but their bar is tiny so we wanted to sit in the restaurant.  When I called to give them a heads up that I wanted to bring a group of 15-20 the manager wanted to charge a 750 dollar minimum. We just wanted to get some pizza and wine. They said if we didn't hit the minimum I would be responsible for the remaining balance! It was a Wednesday and they weren't busy. Needless to say we went somewhere else! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing!  My (Italian) family- ranging from 3 years old to 63- and I have been probably 5-6 times in about 6 months and we have never once been disappointed.  The pizzas are authentic, fresh, and interesting.  The salads are so delicious too.  They have awesome app/drink specials weekly and their \"Pizza of the Month\" never fails to disappoint.  Their wine, cocktail, and beer menu is varied as well.  What else can I say?  Friendly and knowledgeable service in addition- if you are unsure what to order I'd recommend asking the wait staff for suggestions.  My perfect zonal suggestions- Panzanella Salad or Caprese, the Misto App Platter, and the Pizza Brisket, or Margherita DC Pizza, plus gelato for dessert!!"}
{"text":"Meh...it was okay. Nothing bad on their part...their style of pizza is just not my cup of tea. I prefer a thicker crust. Not bad. Just not the best pizza I've had in my life...I likely will not be going out of my way for a follow-up visit but if a group of friends wanted to visit again, I wouldn't be opposed."}
{"text":"UNBELIVEABLE pizza for Vegas!!  As a New Yorker and pizza/sandwich snob, I have yet to find better pizza in Clark Co.  MUST BUST"}
{"text":"Okay saw this place on the food network and have been wanting to stop by every time we are in Vegas but never got around to it.  Well no it we are going to try and make it a regular stop every time. The location we went to was next to Green Valley Casino its across the street in a little strip mall type area.  It is very casual dress and the place is not very big but comfortable.  There is a bar area with T.V. in the corner of the place. The PIE...I have to say that the foundation is the bread crust.  It is so doughy and just a little salty but very chewy.  Greatest tasting crust I have had since having pizza in Italy.  We just the Margherita with buffalo mozzarella it was phenomenal.  We wanted to get meat on the pizza but being our first time we just wanted to taste it with nothing but sauce and cheese, the true tell of a good pizza.  Nothing to cloud the simplicity of great ingredients. We had the pear salad with arugula and balsamic glaze and marmalade.  It was also very tasty, peppery and sweet.  It all blended together very nicely. My recommendation would be to order two pizza cause one isn't gonna be enough.  When you finish the first one your gonna wish you ordered a second.  I would have to say the service was okay.  The water we had wasn't very ....hmmmm...helpful.  I mean he took our order and brought everything we asked for don't get me wrong.  It's just we told him it was our first time there and if he had any suggestions and his response was everyone orders the \"insalata grande\" which is basically a large salad.  I mean with all the salads on the menu that was his recommendation.  It wasn't like he had to be excited about his job, but at least try to sell us on something.  He could have been a little more descriptive or enthusiastic about the food but it was more a hey I'm your waiter let me know what you want.  But he was polite just know you may have to wing it on your first time.  Maybe it was his off night or his first night we just wish he was a little more helpful in recommending something."}
{"text":"I came here solely due to the reviews. I wasn't disappointed! The pizza was amazing, great service, friendly staff and the food came out quickly. Only critique is that it's a little noisy."}
{"text":"Pros:  Ingredients were fresh and delish.  Service is great.  Nutella pie was wonderful.  Cons: A bit pricey averaging $14 a pie. Crust is very very very thin, if you don't consume you're pie right away...it gets soggy.  I guess I'm too loyal to Grimaldi's Pizzaria.  Restaurant is a bit small."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Las Vegas. The Diavola pizza I believe is my favorite of all time. The Margherita DOC is also delicious with the creamy buffalo mozarella. I have to have it at least once a week. The Panzanella salad goes good on top of the pizza. I was never a fan of fennel until the I tried the salad. The service is great. The food rivals Napoli's best pizza. If you're looking for authentic Neapolitan pizza you have to try this. Writing this review is making me hungry!"}
{"text":"It was a little tough to find but that was iPhone GPS' problem not Settebello. Started with MIsto of meats, cheeses, olives, mushrooms, and artichokes - authentic and fantastic. I got the Pizza Quattro Staggione - 1/4 wood fired sausage, 1/4 olives, 1/4 salami, and 1/4 mushroom with added anchovy. Their Neapolitan style pizza is very very good with a nice thin crunchy crust - what's even better is the REAL grated Parmesan in a shaker along with your pizza. I would swear they had just grated it - it definitely was not Kraft."}
{"text":"If you want to go to Italy without flying, here you go!   They even import the flour and are certified by the highly selective Nepolese pizza authority.   This is real. This is not an American pizza. You want Dominos, probably not your place!  Love it!  Try the ice cream too! Cinnamon, yum!"}
{"text":"We've been enjoying the fine Napoletana pizza here since moving to Henderson. OMG - taste exactly like the pizza you enjoy in Naples Italy. Great salads and beets salads as well. Natalia is the perfect mgr rocking a great vibe & attitude. See you again very soon. Ciao!"}
{"text":"While I was out and about running errands. Hunger struck and only one thing sounded good... Pizza! Not just any pizza, I wanted a Margherita pizza like those I enjoyed in Italy. Settebello has long been on my list of places to try. It was finally time to give it a whirl.   When visiting the District, I go west on autopilot. Well, I had to turn around because Settebello is on the east side of Green Valley Parkway. I parked and popped in for lunch.    I was quickly seated and I knew just what I wanted, The Margherita DOC ($13.50) with Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Settebello serves up Pizza Napoletana and it is authentic. This style of pizza is cooked quickly and typically eaten with a fork and knife, but they will cut it into slices upon request. Settebello's Margherita DOC is pretty darn similar to what I had in Naples. They import ingredients and the quality is noted. However, it's worth mentioning Naples wasn't my favorite pizza in Italy, it's a bit wet for my liking, but still enjoyable when in the mood. My craving was satisfied and the best part? I only had to travel to Green Valley to get it."}
{"text":"Love this place reminds me of Naples ! It is not your American pizza ( which I like too! Chicago,NY,and Boston style) but its like being back in Italy.Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  I lived in Italy for a few years and I know my pizza.  If you're in Vegas and you want pizza that is exactly like pizza you get in Italy, then you have to go here.  They have been allowed by the EU's business licensing as Pizza Vera Napoletana, which you need to use all of the ingredients and true pizza tastes straight from Naples.  I started with the 'Insalata Grande' and then I had the Carbonara and I couldn't have been more happy.  Best meal I've had in a year, easily, and it didn't cost me an arm and a leg (like I spent the night before at Ago's at the Hard Rock).  The young American man, form Utah, that started this place has done an amazing job.  Every little detail, from the glasses to the way the utensils are wrapped in a napkin and paper ring, make you feel like you just walked into an Osteria in Naples or Rome.  Give this place your business if you're in Vegas, and you will walk away saving some cash to gamble with and a fulfilled appetite!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they had the first location on Horizon Ridge and the quality has not changed a bit!   If you're looking for authentic fresh Italian pizza, this is the place to go.   I usually order the Panzanella Salad to start and finish with a margarita pizza topped with spicy sausage. AMAZING.   Best part is, the crust is super thin so you can easily devour a whole one to yourself. and trust me, you're not going to want to share"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. The best. Had antipasto.  Was great. Prices somewhat ok. But service sucks. Needs new management to control the staff.  Very disappointed on staff but pizza greattt"}
{"text":"We were there last night for dinner....hadn't been in awhile.  We both forgot how good the food is here!  Great classic cocktails....particularly the Manhattan and Moscow Mule.  We had an incredible salad and the Settebello Pizza.....really excellent....nice place. Service is also very nice."}
{"text":"obsessed!!! this place has been the most legit pizza ive been able to find since visiting italy.  i love EVERYTHING about this place and its authenticity!"}
{"text":"I love this place because it's the closest to real Italian pizza from Italy not NY! The arugula salad is really good too and so so the tiramisu. This is basically the only place I  will order pizza to go from now on."}
{"text":"Settebello is one of those places you think it could be all \"hype\" but you can't ignore forever I'm the last guy who likes gourmet pizza but this place knows what's up  All the pizzas are awesome just order any of them  Must try if you live in Henderson   Takeout is a good plan  Or make sure you get a reso One pizza per person"}
{"text":"The pizza is SO tasty!! The dough is almost like an Indian naan. We ordered the Settebello for the namesake. Good taste with the sausage and mushrooms and fresh tomato sauce. The pine nuts add a little crunch which you don't come across too often on pizzas but is a great addition.  We also had the Diavolo which is also nice! The peppered salami is under the cheese and has a small kick that surprises you when you bite into it a piece of pizza. The fresh basil and peppers are a lovely addition.  We still prefer the Settebello pizza. The restaurant gets 4 stars only because it teeters between being too pretentious and not and when we visit we don't know which side we will walk into."}
{"text":"VPN certified .. basically signed off by the Neapolitan Council in Italy ..means their pizzas are legit. I don't know what it is about the dough but my wife who doesn't really care for pizza was wowed, quite an accomplishment. I suggest initially ordering the margherita DOC. For dessert they do a great tiramisu (very light)."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is one of those elusive things here in Vegas. There aren't many really good happy hour places, but Settebello delivers. On the happy hour, not their pizzas. You have to pick those up.  The plates are great for early snacking, very reasonably priced and quick to come out. The drinks are even on discount. Very few things are better than sipping a sangria and eating their delicious food while enjoying the 100 degree temperatures in the shade on their patio.  Service was good, attentive and prompt. Food was excellent and quick to arrive. Dessert was decadent (Sweet Cream Gelato in Espresso, a perfect finish).  I'm eagerly awaiting an excuse to head back, except next time get a pizza."}
{"text":"Never cared much for pizza until a foodie friend recommended Settebello.  And, now...I suffer from Settebellotitis.  I ache, crave and long for their pizza and carpaccio salad.  The freshness of the ingredients and the special preparation I know that goes into their product is undeniable.    I spent $30 for an iced tea, pizza, carpaccio salad and tip and for the average working girl, it's definitely a treat and DAMN WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!  For those who \"don't get it\" and think there's too much hype surrounding Settebello...well, they're probably used to the fast food junk out there and there's no reasoning with them."}
{"text":"Ever read The Emperor's New Clothes? Enjoy the subtleties of the story at Settebello.   Here's the gist:    excellent pizza dough cooked for 2 minutes in a 1000 degree oven. Down vote for all of the burnt spots all over the visible top crust and the bottom. Five star voters must have dead taste buds or are susceptible to group think.   crushed tomato without seasoning.  One or two pieces of basil on top. Wait a minute...  was the chef naked?  about five pieces of sausage, one tiny sliver of prosciutto, and about 1/2 ounce of mushrooms on top.   I know that pizza is a high markup commodity, but 75 cents of ingredients for a $13 pizza is outrageous. Don't look at me smugly and tell me that scant ingredients let the flavors reveal themselves.  The burnt spots on the pizza completely smother all the flavors."}
{"text":"The dough (crust) comes out burned/charred. I am OK with the tasteless tomato sauce some people mention, I actually like sauce like that. Some other pizzerias just add too many spices in the sauce and I don't like it.  But why, or why? Why do you burn the crust like that. Please, don't tell me that's how oven baked or wood fired pizza should be. I've tried them all and the crust should NOT be so burned. Check out my photos. It was so bad, my kids did not want to eat the pizza, in the end they ate only the mid secrion of it.   The pizza is very thin. The sauce and cheese are light. Toppings tasted good. These are all food things. That's why I give it 2 stars.  Other bad things - other parts of the pizza were slightly burned as well and the toppings were unevenly spread.  Please, fix your ovens or replace them."}
{"text":"Such great pizza, I wish it weren't so far from my home.  However, I have schlepped over there three times now and have tried the Diavola, Bianca and Pizza Lasagna (still a pizza, but with ricotta mixed into the toppings).  I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite and will probably keep working my way through their menu.  The pizzas are large enough that I can't always finish one, but not so big I only want half.  They use quality ingredients and the crust is the perfect blend of crusty exterior and chewy, flavorful interior. Last time I was there, it wasn't busy but service was not good.  However, I can overlook that when the food is this amazing."}
{"text":"My favorite Pizza place in town. Great food and drinks! The pizza is spot on Naples, Italy style.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"This place actually just moved and is worth the trip: http://www.yelp.com/biz/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson-3"}
{"text":"I love the Happy Hour menu but the service just continues to get worse and worse. Their reverse happy hour is from 8-9 pm, and on the last two times I've gone, I arrived with some friends at 8:25. The server Tricia literally greeted the table by saying \"You know you have 10 minutes to order right?\". How about Good evening! Welcome to Settebello! Can I get some drinks started for you? Lol. Didn't check on us once and we had to ask the busser to order another round of drinks. I get you want to leave, but it's just plain rude. There's plenty of good happy hours in the area with great food AND service, don't go where they obviously don't want the business."}
{"text":"Stopped in one afternoon after touring some nearby apartments. The pizza was delicious and the staff was helpful and friendly. We got a couple different pizzas and both were really nice. The prices weren't outrageous either. Great place to stop before or after a movie!"}
{"text":"I've had pizza in Naples, Sali's pizza in New Haven, & I've had Tony's pizza in SF; this pizza is not good.  either the dough is over hydrated or the oven isn't hot enough.  The crust is soggy with absolutely no crunch or snap.  The toppings are bland and very little salt."}
{"text":"Very authentic italian style pizza. Equates to thin crust in the US. But the dough is so fresh, you can taste the autenticity of it. Good beers as well. Desserts are all really good."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for pizza!  I always order the same thing. ..the capricciosa.  My husband likes to go here for their gluten free crust (which you can order 24 hours in advance).  The service is always good here and I always leave with a full and happy tummy!"}
{"text":"I find this place to be absolutely yummy. I am a napoletan pizza groupie! I love it napoletan pizza! It's the only pizza! I'm obsessed. My grandmother was from Napoli and she would have approved of this place I'm sure of it. I've been to Napoli myself, and although there is NOTHING like the actual real deal, I must say, they come close...eh on a good day. I have never had a bad experience, but their service is kind of wack ya know?!       I remember the first time I went in there when it first opened. I was so excited! Finally a napoletan pizza place conveniently located! Anyway, I was asking some of the staff a few questions about some italian liquors and if they use mozzerella di buffala, and no one knew what I was talking about. So that kind of killed my excitement. All and all the food is good. I love the Margarita or that Diovala  pizza. The Capri pizza is pretty good too, and I love the Misto (meats and cheeses). I suggest eating it there. I picked it up today, and its not as good as it is freshly made. I kinda hate to say Due Forni on town center drive is better. I will stick to that place after tonight. At least there, they are well versed and appreciate the love and culture of a true 'taliano."}
{"text":"This is THEE best pizza I have had in all of Las Vegas! I am gluten free and this is also by far the best gluten free pizza I've ever had in my lifetime. This is our go to pizza place and it's great every single time!!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best gluten free crust anywhere in the world! We will be back again and again. Friendly and attentive staff. You will not be disappointed if you haven't already been."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. I ordered a salad and under one of my leaves was a LIVE GRASSHOPPER.  It was just chillin in there!! I'm all about keeping food natural-but what?? After I told the waiter they comp'ed the Salad but nothing else. Did I expect too much wishing for a comp'ed meal? Usually I'm not about causing a problem but I had a LIVE BUG in my food. So yes, there is no way am I coming back."}
{"text":"visited Settebello yesterday for a to-go lunch order.  I went with the \"settebello\" pizza ($13.50) - sausage, pancetta, mushrooms and pine nuts.  After ordering, walked down to Rocket Fizz to pick-up a few \"artisan\" sodas.  Returned just in time to pick up pizza and go my way.  I felt the pizza was undercooked - very slight charring on the top of the pizza crust,  The mozzarella was not melted, a boatload of pine nuts, yet very light on mushroom..  Still, the flavors were there - especially liked the sausage and the pancetta.  I'm hoping this is simply a \" working out the kinks\" situation yet I wonder since at the time I entered the restaurant, I only saw 3 customers - what happens when there are 30 customers ???  I'll return"}
{"text":"Late night happy hour prices and selection are amazing!  We had dinner and drinks for less than $30 and it was very satisfying and fulfilling.  Pizza is woodfired and tasty.  The service was very good as well."}
{"text":"I went with a large group of girls (about 10-12) for happy hour prior to seeing a movie.  The happy hour is very well priced and the drinks/food are delicious. I had an Old Fashioned which was pretty good and only $5.   We ordered a few mini pizzas and an artichoke crostini.   The crostini was pretty basic and kinda tasted like artichoke from a can slapped on to some toast with goat cheese.  The mini pizzas were excellent. Perfect char on the crust from the brick oven and the sauces/cheeses were well blended.  The service however was lacking. It was apparent the first few minutes of arrival that the staff was struggling with the amount of people in the bar area...we were the bulk of the people in the bar. The waitress took all of our orders but didn't write anything down. Sadly, she had to return to confirm what was ordered but didn't want more than one person talking at a time. She then starting making drinks as well while another person was behind the bar not doing much of anything. Next time, write things down and nudge your co-worker to help you out."}
{"text":"We have never failed to find the pop of flavored our hungers seek in 4 years of dining at Setto Bello!!! Excellent favors artfully constructed to please the eye as well."}
{"text":"Customer service was great, the specialty pizza was had a good crust flavor and texture was what i expected, but the meatballs i ordered were hot on the out side, cold in the middle and very the fried risotto and sauce it came with was very bland and not propperly seasoned... so i doubt i will go back... for $50 pizza meal for two i believe pizza rock is a better choice."}
{"text":"I am a local and I have been on the hunt for the perfect Italian eatery.  I FOUND IT!  I was invited by an Italian family to join them for a late supper.  Surprisingly they have a $5 menu.  I ordered Artichoke Bruschetta and a small hand made pizza at $5 each.  I would have paid more!!!  Guys this is the REAL DEAL.  Real and authentic Italian food.  Wonderful vibe and awesome servers.  I will definitely be back with my family.  Thanks for a truly enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Where do I start, the pizza... too obvious, ok ok uh,  the meat.. Ya ya the meat! The prosciutto is better than any deli I've been to or maybe it's what that 900 degree wood fire oven does to it but it's lovely on my tongue. They don't have pepperoni, what you say, a pizza joint that doesn't have pepperoni is 5 stars? Yes they have a spicy salami and after,  you'll wish your pizzeria did too! So yes the food is fantastic, but without the service no matter how good it was you wouldn't come  back. They always greet you with a smile, make sure your cup no matter what it is, is always full."}
{"text":"I really don't know what the hype is about. The pizza is not good and expensive. 12 inch pizza starting at $10-$11.  Very thin crust and very little toppings. Hubby ordered the diavolo and thought it was good. It was ok for me. Thin crust, soggy in the middle. I ordered the margherita pizza and asked if they had fresh spinach. Nope- no spinach. What? Ok so got it after a short wait. For those that don't know, it is plain pizza with tomato sauce, buffalo cheese, basil, garlic. There was 3 tiny pieces of basil. People- for $10 can u put at least 6 or 7 basil pieces - u are making a profit. Thin soggy crust, cheap toppings for high prices. I will say their panna cotta was good. But I would not come back here. Pappa John- here I come!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was super tasty I got the Pizza Carbonara and man was it delicous, maybe one of the tastiest pizza's ive ever had, they had a nice selection of tasty beers that I enjoyed, restaurant looked very clean inside and well designed. I'll definitely be making a stop there next time im in the vegas area."}
{"text":"Great authentic pizzeria. This is the real thing, if your looking for American pizza this is not it. Traditional Italian pizza, softer crust, but fresh. Everything down to the condiments,  silverware and music are italian. Try the Mist if you love good antipasto. The Inalada Grande (salad) is awedome, and i dont like dalad much.Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was just in there, solo, to chill out, eat some pizza, drink some wine and hang out.   Random drunk dude (at 8:30pm) approaches me and asks me if I want a shot of Jack (no). Proceeds to harass me about my haircut and ask me if I know his homeless buddy who, also, is from Seattle.   Then he asks me if I have a problem with him?   Pizza to go please!  I called the bartender after I left and told him he had a problem on his hands with that guy and he seemed receptive but, honestly, he should have sniffed that problem out right away.  Shit shouldn't get that weird in a place like that. There were families in there and I'm sure they weren't looking for a guy like that around them.   Full disclosure; I like to party and I do like to drink and be inappropriate... a lot. Just not in someplace like that. Ain't nobody got time for that when there are kids around.  Pizza was OK out of a box at home. Drank a beer and jumped in the pool."}
{"text":"Proceed with caution, may be habit forming. If you want authentic thin crust, Neapolitan pizza that tastes like it's fresh out of Italy, then this is the place for you. This is my absolute favorite pizza place in the Las Vegas/Henderson area.  + Tasty, fresh hot pizza   + Margarita pizza is my top choice  + Insalata grande is light & a perfect starter to share + Located In The heart of Green Valley, by Wholefoods + They offer gluten-free crust + Service is always fantastic + The have a good happy hour (M-Th, 3pm - 6pm)  - They charge about $5 for gluten-free  - It's so good you will most likely overeat   Take a quick trip to \"Italy\" and get ready to devour some cheesy, steamy, heavenly PIZZA! If you think it sounds like it can't get much better, you're wrong it does. I've tried every single dessert, each more gratifying than the next."}
{"text":"Don't know what has happened to the Henderson location.  Not only has the food gone south (very bland and tasteless) but they are allow there male servers to mimic the scum that walk the streets with their pants so low that there butts hang out.  I can tolerate it when I don't have to pay and eat from the person who dresses like this.  Or maybe it is just that the management doesn't care!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had outside of Florence Italy, the flavor and crust is spot on. Try the margarita, it will transport you back there...I promise (even if it's just for a few seconds ;))  We come for  the happy hours because the 2 for 1 beer prices just can't be beat. plus, I really like their italian craft brews selection (im pretty sure i've posted a picture of the ones we liked before).  The staff is usually pretty good, but we always sit at the bar...so that probably helps. though I will say (Kendra the bartender) was by far our favorite."}
{"text":"Really great love there pizza it's authentic the way a pizza should taste fresh ."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch with my husband 1.5 weeks ago because we saw this restaurant featured on the Cooking Channel's Unique Eats. This restaurant is different from your typical pizzeria because of their Neapolitan style pizza (slices of mozzarella on pizza instead of the shredded with toppings you desire all cooked in a wood burning oven).   When we came into this restaurant, we were immediately acknowledged and seated right away. This is what we ordered:  Settebello- This was definitely one of the better pizzas I have ever had. Our server said this was one of their most popular pizzas (he told this after we ordered it). This pizza was really good, as it had a nice crisp, thin and tender chewy crust. All of the flavors in the 1st bite was very satisfying and I would order this again. By the way, because this restaurant is trying to be as authentic as the pizzas in Italy, they do not normally serve the pizzas pre-sliced like you would find in other restaurants. But he said we could request for them to cut it for us if we wanted. We just cut a piece of the pizza to share ourselves.  Panzanella Salad- good portion, clean tasting and something I wanted because I was jonesing for salad for lunch. I asked for the salad dressing to be placed on the side and it came as I had requested. This salad isn't exactly memorable, but I got what I wanted and was satisfied with it.   Overall, our lunch was a good experience. It wasn't too crowded when we arrived (around 12 pm) but could see that they do get a good lunch crowd. The only negative thing I would say about our experience though was our server. He was rather strange because he would say some real odd comments that make you just kind of think 'what...?' .... but other than that, no other negatives.   By the way, this place is located in the same plaza as Whole Foods. There is plenty of parking and there is outdoor seating here."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets.  I used to live in chicago and while I'm a fan of the chicago-style pizza, I would throw chicago-style pizza in front of a bus to save Napoletana-style pizza's life anyday.  Can we just talk about the crust?  The chewiest, softest, goodest (yeah I know it's not a word) crust in the UNIVERSE.  I've never had a bad pizza here and I've been here probably at least 25 times.  This is my ultimate suggestion to order...no matter how many or few people you are with.  You can always take some home:  Get an apertivi to start.  Anything with Aperol in it is ok by me.  Ensalada Grande (mixed leafy greens, kalamata olives, artichoke, sauteed mushrooms, tomato and parmigiana cheese)  Misto platter--Italian meats, cheese and foccacia bread  ANY pizza or ask for the Ripieno calzone.  It's not on the menu anymore, but by far my favorite.  I like it more than their pizza.  Then pretty much any dessert.  Happy eating yo!"}
{"text":"A fine certified pie. The crust passes the fold test though I felt it was a little bready. The sauce was top notch. Great service just before noon. The atmosphere was a fit for the area though maybe a little sterile."}
{"text":"I would have given it 4 or 5 stars but I'm getting tired of them changing things time and time again. We have been going there since it opened and first they stopped serving sangria Italiano. Sangria is a definite must have! Then they keep changing the Misto! It use to have a great roasted zucchini and Kalamata type olive's along with the selection of meats, then a changed to an awful green olives,  now they have a awful fried eggplant and fried zucchini. Who wants more grease with the fats from the meat? The fresh selections were a much better choice! Service has been slipping a bit also.."}
{"text":"This is the only pizza place my husband and I like in town. They have gluten free crusts that actually taste good! ($4 extra charge, FYI.) The service is great! They personalize the pizza to our liking, and they are very nice. The pizza is yummy. The salads and beet dish are also very good. Nothing to complain about here."}
{"text":"Been several times. Always great!  The pizza size is a hearty meal for one, or a delicious part of a meal for two.  My date and I usually split a pizza and a salad (the Beet Salad is a fave!) and that is plenty for two big guys. If we're still hungry, we'll finish up with one of the delicious deserts.    Last night, we shared the seasonal special - the Ripieno Autunno, which was absolutely fantastic! One of my favorite things ever!  \"Ripieno\" just means 'stuffed' - and \"Autunno\" (as you might guess) is 'Autumn'.  This stuffed and folded pizza was truly special. Sweet squash combined with sausage and a generous amount of fresh sage stuffed into a perfectly baked crust made for a perfect cool-weather repast. Stuffed with Autumn, indeed!  As a bonus, we happened to be there on a Thursday - when the drink special is Margaritas of several different sorts for the extremely reasonable price of $4. I had the \"Italian\" Margarita - which had Amaretto and orange juice. Unusual, and I don't know if I'd call it a \"margarita\" - but I liked it! (I had a second).   Four drinks, the Ripieno and a very large salad came to just under $50 - which isn't cheap, but is quite reasonable for the quality of the food and the nice-casual vibe of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's so yummy and the staff is great. As a college student, I studied in Italy for a semester, and let me tell you, THIS is authentic Italian pizza! Heaven. I'd eat it every day if I didn't think my derrière would get too big."}
{"text":"My wife liked the pizza and experience which is why we will probably return. The service staff was always friendly and kept my coke refreshed which I appreciate. Wife had a glass of their white sangria. We ordered the vegetable, cheese and meat antipasta appetizer which was good, I felt the cheese could have been better options, I did really enjoy the olives, spicy marinated zucchini and meats served with this app. For entrees my wife had the bolognese pizza (as I mention before she loved) and I had the Settebello pizza, named after the restaurant or vise versa. For having this name the pizza was underwhelming. The sausage was bland, the pine nuts didn't add to the dish, plus the pizza got soggy quickly, I prefer a crispy crust. I did enjoy the crushed pizza sauce. For dessert we ordered the mint chip gelato and panna cotta, both were very good. The restaurant was busy and in a great location within the district."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service but the temp in the restaurant was unbearable.  This is the second time we have been at this establishment where it seemed the air wasn't on."}
{"text":"Nice environment. But best pizza in Vegas? Not so much. Friendly fast service was the best part. The pizza was good, different and interesting. But for my fellow westsiders Grimaldi's is much better and closer."}
{"text":"I usually am not a fan of thin pizza, but Settebello is amazing.  This traditional pizzeria is always a treat for my family."}
{"text":"Overall this place is just plain and just OK. The atmosphere is good, the service was good, but the food is sub-par. I imagine it's fine for happy hour but otherwise I don't think the pizza and salad is good."}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza places in the Henderson/ Vegas area. The atmosphere is sleek and clean while the servers are friendly and attentive. The pizza is served quickly so it's hot and fresh. If you enjoy Napoli style pizza, you need to check this place out.   If you have a taste for spicy food and meat, the Diavola is a good choice. It's made with peppered salami, garlic, roasted red peppers and crushed red pepper.  If you love arugula and prosciutto, do the Bianca. It does not have crushed tomatoes (binding sauce) but has a generous amount of shaved parmigiano reggiano.  The Involtini di prosciutto is so good. It is basically, arugula wrapped in prosciutto and topped with par-reg and goat cheese, with drizzled olive oil and balsamic reduction.  The Caprese is fresh as well."}
{"text":"Delicious personal sized pizzas with lightweight fresh crust. It's made in a real brick fire oven in the back, with you can tell by the crusts lightly charred edges, which i personally love. The wine and mixed drink se toon here is decent and pairs well with the food type. My date and i ordered s salad as well to split and I'm glad we didn't get two! It quite large, fresh, and tasty ! This is a yummy, reasonably priced, cute little date nite spot!"}
{"text":"Once again, our visit was wonderful!!!Food, service, atmosphere.   Thoroughly loved our insalate grande ,margerita pizza, house chianti and expresso. p.s. I included a photo of my husband with the pizza:-)  We will return next time we are back in town."}
{"text":"Booked a group late for 40+ people and they were absolutely perfect with the service. No complaints at all about the requests for multiple tabs(kids sports team event) and all the food came out fast and hot. The server, without being asked, inquired about food allergies(gluten and nut) and had alternatives ready  It was my first time at a Settobello and I am excited to know there is one close to my home in Orange County. The 'style' of pizza was perfect, the dough was incredible, and the side salads and meatballs were great too. Also, a very good bar with a great selection of beers on draft and bottle.   Final observation, the build-out was modern, comfortable and clean without feeling 'stuffy'.."}
{"text":"This place has 4.5 stars for a reason: awesome Neapolitan style pizzas.  I've been coming to this restaurant for 7 years, basically whenever I travel to Vegas I stop in, sometimes more than once per trip. If you've never had this style of pizza, and there are more and more places that are doing it, then you should definitely try it.  Settebello is one of the first places to have started making pizza like this in Vegas.    They've recently expanded the menu, offering more combinations of toppings.  I almost always go with the Margherita, which is insanely good for being just crust, sauce, mozzarella and a little basil.  A tip though: always ask for the pizza sliced (the standard is not to slice it).  The rest of the menu has expanded a bit, too, where they now offer a wider array of salads, salumi, and oven-roasted appetizers.  In my opinion, the Rucola salad is the best and unique - again, just arugula, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper, and they manage to turn a set of humble ingredients into something great."}
{"text":"If you like super thin pizza in a brick oven with fresh great ingredients you should definitely come here ."}
{"text":"I know this is supposedly the best pizza in Vegas, but I guess I'm not a huge fan of it...  First off, the service here is wonderful. They are all very attentive and friendly, checking to make sure everything is to your liking. The wait can be long but they'll give you water as you're waiting. There's always the option to sit at the bar too and get some appetizer before a table opens up.  The menu has a decent selection of pizzas and they usually have a special pizza of the day. You can get pizzas with or without tomato sauce. The pizzas I have tried are the Diavola, the Vico, and one of their specials of the day but I can't remember too much about it.   Diavola - It has a very nice little kick from the crushed red peppers and the salame gives a good saltiness.  Vico - The mascarpone pretty much melted and mixed with the olive oil and was a great substitute for having no crushed tomatoes. I was skeptical about no tomatoes but was pleasantly surprised. I also really liked the fennel and wood oven sausage, even though I generally am not a fan of sausage.  So why the 3 stars? I'm not a huge fan of their crust. It's a bit too wet and thin for me. This is one of those very thin pizzas where it's probably easier to eat with a fork and knife. For me, I like a crust that can hold its weight and has a nice crunch. Theirs is nice and doughy, which I do like, but it doesn't have that solid crust I really like in a pizza. Their toppings are great and all work well together, but there is very little.. I know this is supposed to be how traditional pizzas are, but I guess my poor student budget doesn't agree with it too much.    This isn't the best pizza in my eyes, but everyone has different tastes. It is undeniably good in terms of quality of toppings, but it just doesn't have the amount I would like. And that crust, it leaves me wanting more crunch!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place.  It did not disappoint.  If you want a thin crust pizza that folds and places a giant smile on your face, this is it.  Great service, great value"}
{"text":"Usually one of our favorites. Waited 1 hr.  for pizza that never came. Finally left after paying for salads. Mentioned to hostess on exiting. They were very busy but should know Friday in December always is. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pizza I ordered sucked return to waitress I ordered only meat pizza sausage Didn't notice it was white sauce and broccoli .....disgusting ....terrible , wife ordered magahrita pizza loved it so it was just mine and bad taste...... Service sucked"}
{"text":"Simply delicious! Excellent service. Amazing pizza! We arrived in time for happy hour and I ordered a mini pizza and a salad. It was perfect. The draft beer was nice and cold. My husband loved his pizza too. They have a real wood burning oven. The dough is delicious!!! We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza! It reminds me of real Italian pizza. Happy Hour specials are good also!"}
{"text":"We live a couple of miles away and go about once every couple of months...Every time the only question is why don't we go more often? This is not anything you find in the chains, it is truly one of a kind for the Las Vegas area. Don't expect anything with a stuffed crust or slogan, just an unpretentious atmosphere and great food from a menu that sticks to what they are good at. PS don't try to get it for take out, it is never as good as right from the oven."}
{"text":"Excellent! We had a Caprese salad & Pizza Carbonara.  Both were outstanding and reasonably priced! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Carbonara pizza. It was a little soggy for my taste... Service was good, and they got the pizza to us pretty fast. I don't think I'd ever go back, but I wouldn't avoid it either."}
{"text":"We have been coming to settebello for a long time and the reason they are still open and busy after all these years is because the quality is consistent. We never, ever had a bad experience! I love their pizza! I am from Italy and their pizza reminds me of the flavor of pizza I used to eat in Italy. Their Tiramisu is delicious also."}
{"text":"When my BF and I want pizza, this is where we go. We start by sharing one of their delicious salads. We especially like the Insalada Grande, Panzanella and Romania. The greens are always very fresh and the other ingredients are top notch. And then we usually have the Settebello pizza but sometime order a Margherita or Diavola pizza. We love their thin crust and fresh ingredients. Ask for their spicy oil to really bring out the taste."}
{"text":"This new wave of Neapolitan pizza is very welcomed, as it is a great new edition to the NY (yum), Chicago (YUM!), and California (eh) styles that have dominated here for years. Settebello, much like the the other Neapolitan joints I have tried, concerns itself with quality ingredients, which is the most important key to a good pie, regardless of the style. On our visit, we had the Diavola and the namesake Settebello pizzas. Both were nifty little numbers. The only part that was lacking was a slightly soggy middle, which is a common side effect from the Neapolitan style of cooking. In addition to the pizza, Settebello offers a decent wine list at reasonable prices. The location is in a strip mall. And while they tried jazzing it up with some \"Old World\" looking touches (executed with varying degrees of commitment), it still feels like you are in a strip mall. Our service was just jake. Settebello is not the type of experience that would prompt me to drive across the valley (it is about as far from my house as anywhere in the Vegas area), but it is a superb option if I find myself in the same hood."}
{"text":"Probably the best place in Vegas area for italian style pizza. Prices could be a bit lower but still reasonable"}
{"text":"OMG! Fabulous tasting pizza crust.  I mean it was truly a memorable experience eating here.  Between four of us, we had the Misto, and we tried four different pizza (ended up taking 1.5 home).  All good, with the exception of the Margherita, which was a bit on the soggy side.  I enjoyed it so much, I will go just for the Misto--A Sampling of Italian Style Meats, Vegetables and a Bite of Cheese. Served with Focaccia!!    My only reason for JUST 4 stars was the 'tiny bit soggy'  Margherita pizza."}
{"text":"Highly recommended, make the trip if you can! Every visit has been delicious. Pizza is simple in the best way. Staff is friendly, and even when it's busy, the atmosphere isn't overwhelming. Make sure to get your own pizza; you're gonna want to eat it all!!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour and really friendly service 1st, a shout out for the bartender MADISON or was it MADISAN? She was GREAT and my wine glass was never empty, she was really helpful with my wife's food orders (my wife is a Vegan so thats not easy.) and she had no problem making suggestions (i like that) The food was all above average and tasted great from the happy hour menu The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because they have their own label for all the wines and i can't find them on the internet, I like tracking and saving wine info with Vivino app My wrap up is: Service 100%, Food was AMAZING (I didn't like the Tiramisu that much) Wine selection, Very Good not huge, but I liked all the wines I tried (5 in all)  Im not sure if the 5th wine was good or not, my Buzz was making everything seem good by then haha  I will go back for sure"}
{"text":"My search for good pizza continues...  When I first came across Settebello's reviews on yelp, I imagined a quaint Italian bistro, sitting in front of a wood fired oven.   We walked in, and I was disappointed at how commercial it looked. But getting to the food-the most important part, I didn't think it was worthy of 4 stars. Something about my sauce dripping off of my paper thin crust didn't appeal to me.  I've tried many different types of pizzas and this wasn't the hearty cheese+topping rich pie that I like. I shared a pizza with my fiance who shares my passion for pizza, and he agreed. We left feeling hungry.  On a brighter note, the ingredients although few were fresh.  Also, the tiramisu was delicious. Not too heavy or sweet.  Last but not least the prices were very affordable."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Service is great. Quality of the food makes it 4 stars. If I compare it to the authentic pizza I've had in Napoli, its 50% close. Not quite there, but it's as close as I'm gonna get for now. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time here we started off with meatballs and then a 12in pizza that are waiter put together for us very delicious and now he's going to put us a dessert that he recommend I would recommend this establishment to anybody that likes thin crust pizza and very clean establishment we will return."}
{"text":"Delicious. Their ensalada grande is still on of my favorites, with mushrooms, pine nuts and artichokes. My friend and I both had a Californian Nebbiolo, which was tasty and in hindsight, we should have split a bottle, but the server didn't recommend it and we didn't think of it. Service was nice, not overbearing but attentive. I had the diavala, which was super yummy and my friend, the Bianca with prosciutto and arugula. Both were tasty, but I felt were missing something.... Something spicy, perhaps, more than just dry chili flakes."}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about Settebello and I finally got to try it!  First of all, the service is amazing - from the hostess to the server to the busser. Someone was always checking to see if we needed refills or anything else. I tipped generously for that.   Second, the decor was cute and very authentic looking. I've been to Italy and Settebello blended the wood and marble aesthetic perfectly.   As far as the food goes, I wasn't super impressed with the pizza brisket I got which is why I'm not giving 5 stars; it just felt like it was missing something. Also, while the meatballs were good, there was a lot of bread in them (sometimes more bread than meat).   Overall, I would definitely come back again and try something different!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Good food, good happy hour, good people (Bryan and Tyler). highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food was full of fresh ingredients and was overall tasty. I do wish that their pizza crust would have been crisper though. I would not say that it's one of those places that will become a staple when dining out, but it does have a great atmosphere and service. The prices are mostly in the $9-$15 dollar range."}
{"text":"I love settebello! Austin and Matt's service was next level, they were so kind and gave the best recommendations. My hostess Lexi was very sweet as well. I really enjoy coming here & the food is great!"}
{"text":"Food was really good but the service was horrible! The salads were very good and refreshing. The pizzas were amazing! We will return but probably to-go since the service was bad. When we arrived there were 2 other tables in his section and I thought ok maybe he's new or something but he only got worse as the tables left. We not once asked for several items so it's not like we were asking for much, just you know basic service. We ran out of drinks multiple times and we had a pile of dishes that the nice runner had to take. When he dropped check he didn't even offer dessert or say thanks. We had to get up and there were like 5-6 employees and they were all trying to get his attention to pay us out. Wow..maybe it was a rough day?"}
{"text":"worst of the worst, flavorless, burnt pizza dough, fake wannabe pancetta, they use low bid fatty shit bacon, pizza makers unskilled, wait staff, useless, like italy no service nor concern for you the paying guest, just pure, shit quality. no flavor zero, no service zero, tables dirty and shake, mgmt even worse then staff no where to be found. just a big joke to a real business, total joke of a place that nobody, really wants to just say no no no.  give up eating if this is to be a italia ristorante a nasty dirty lazy fucking place"}
{"text":"This place has sadly gone \"American style \". The pizzas are more saucy and less Neopolitan style. It's supposed to be authentic! Not anymore. It's still really good, but not like it was! So sad!"}
{"text":"WOW! I never knew pizza could taste sooooo good! you each order your own 12\" pizza so you really get what you want...the freshest prosciutto to roasted mushrooms, fresh mozzerella, in house crushed tomotoes....this is making my mouth water just talking about it.......the hand tossed oven baked crewy hot crust!!! so delicious.   THIS IS THE ONLY PIZZA YOU SHOULD EVER EAT! and once you do, say good bye to Round Table, Papa John's, the pizza joint on the corner or where ever you are getting pizza and come to Settebello and eat like you are in Italy, Ciao~"}
{"text":"From out of town, randomly stopped into this place and SO GLAD WE DID. The food was incredible, we ordered the brisket pizza and it did not disappoint. Our server Thomas was amazing, and on top of everything. So impressed by this spot. Will be back next time we are in town!!"}
{"text":"A large group of us visited here for the first time and were not that impressed. The restaurant itself was nice as was the service. We ordered a number of things including three different salads, a bruschetta appetizer and three different pizzas. The salads and appetizer were solid. The pizza was a letdown. The dough was very flimsy and seemingly undercooked. The toppings were okay but the pizza itself was almost room temperature. If we ever return we will be sure to ask for the pizza to be cooked well done."}
{"text":"I thought I was in Naples!They serve authentic traditional neapolitan style pizza, thin crust, super fresh ingredients, just a few toppings.....delicious.....salads and appetizers are yummy too  - and the gelato is as good as it gets.  Run don't walk to Settebello!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the prices are ok, the service was excellent. The place is cute, and has ample parking."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot.  We always get the margherita pizZa and insalata.  Great texture and flavors."}
{"text":"We were greeted and acknowledged when we entered. The staff was attentive and asked us immediately what we would like. Table was cleaned and setup quickly and then we were greeted by the server Austin. We would definitely will be back especially since the staff was on point with the customer interaction.  We weren't blown away by the pizza though. Maybe it was the hype from friends, but don't get me wrong, it was good pizza. We ordered the Insalata, Margherita pizza, and got meatballs for an app at the recommendation of the waiter Austin. Meatballs and salad were great and ordered a kids cheese pizza for the little guy in our family who loved his pizza. Want to come back and try the Nutella dessert pizza."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza. Nicely charred a bit on bottom as it should be. You have to try the Pear and Jalapeno jam pizza. You only get it in this location and it's amazing. it sounds weird, but it's an amazing flavor combination. I also love their Pizza Capricciosa. The Romana Salad and the Beet Salad are very good too. One of the best things though, is their Panna Cotta dessert. Perfect consistency, not overly sweetened and has a nice added touch with the Strawberry and Balsamic on top. Décor is rustic and spacious with a \"generous\" feel to it. Service is very good as well.  We've been there many times and got served by different people but it was always great and friendly service."}
{"text":"I feel like the quality of food has dropped a little bit since I last ate here.  Went here for lunch yesterday and I was hugely disappointed.  Ordered the marinara pizza like I always do.  There was wayyyyyy too much sauce...to the point where the pizza dough was extremely soggy.  It just had an all around bad texture & taste... even my toddler wouldn't touch it after one bite.  I couldn't believe how terrible it was.  I also ordered the insalata grande salad and it didn't taste that great; not sure what the change was.  Not sure that I will go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great pizza and craft Italian beers.  Saw the place on Travel Channel and had to try it."}
{"text":"Worst experience by far ! We have been coming to settebello for years and today was a disgrace , our appetizer didn't come out until our pizza , then I found a BUG crawling in my pizza and the waiters response was \"well I can assure you it didn't go in the oven that way \" well you got that one right ! How was that any type of response ? It's a joke then my boyfriends parents pizza came out they are kosher and specifically asked for no meat and yet there was meat on the pizza! We  sent it  back and we waited once again . And our waitress was never to be found ever word of advice settebello train your employees and chefs the correct way to avoid disgusting mistakes and rookie mistakes as a restaurant . HUGE disappointment sad to say we will never be back ."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out since I read an article in forbes magazine that setebello is one of the best places for pizza in the US.  We've tried a lot of Pizza places in Las Vegas Dom De Marco's was good, but when  we tried the setebello this place hands down has the best pizza in town. Thin crust with great selection on fillings. We did try their happy hour and their selection was great. We will definitely come back and try the other selections of pizza."}
{"text":"Tequila Mockingbird. The name of one of their drinks!!!! Check them out to see the rest of their PUNNY drink list.    We came in on a Saturday night and it was empty. (maybe they don't realize the goodness that is Settebello).   We were greeted by the host and he was very friendly; we cracked jokes with each other. We got a booth and were given time to look at the menu.  Waters came out and while we glanced at the drink menu. They had some pretty funny drink names: Tequila Mockingbird was our fave. lol We ordered our pizzas: capricciosa and diavola.   The pizzas came out pretty fast and they were made to perfection. The capricciosa had crushed tomatos, prosciutto cotto, artichokes, mushrooms, olives, mozzarella, basil and olio. The blend of these ingredients were so mouthwatering; I couldn't stop eating!! I finished the whole pizza by myself lol.  My friend had the diavola which had crushed tomatos, red bell peppers, spicy salame, garlic, mozzarella, basil and olio. I didn't get to taste it but only because my friend ate all of it--meaning it had to have been delicious since he is very much so italian (speaks it fluently, so I guess that means his opinion is legit).   The service was great as well; our waitress was attentive and friendly; she checked in with us and wasn't overbearing at constantly checking in.   I'll come back and maybe with more friends next time :) Next time I'll try the Crime and Punish-Mint cocktial!! haha"}
{"text":"Came in to try out their happy hour. They have two times 3-6 and 830-close.   The table ordered Moscow mules ($5), arancini ($5), Diavola pizzette ($5), Vico pizzette ($5), and a Emilia pizzette ($5). This was a great way to try out the different pizzas they had to offer.   There were two arancini that came with the order. The crust was delightfully crunchy and crisp which complimented the fluffy filling and tangy marinara sauce. (4/5)  The diavola pizzette was topped with crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell pepper, crush red pepper, garlic, mozz, and some evoo. Unfortunately with the amount of toppings, the dough of the pizza soaked it all in and became a mush when I bit into the slice. It was more of a salad with a charred crust. (2/5)  My favorite from the pizzette as was the Vico. Toppings on the Vico included sausage, red onion, mascarpone, basil, mozz, evoo, and roasted fennel. The pizza managed to stay in one piece when picked up unlike the diavola. The texture was awesome with the creaminess of the mascarpone mixed with the succulent sausage and the crunch of the roasted fennel. I would come back for this pizza! (4.5/5)  Lastly, the Emilia pizzette had prosciutto cotto, Italian cream, mozz, evoo, parmigiana reggiona, and corn. This was a very savory and creamy pizza. It lacked acids to balance the flavor and had me taking sips of the Moscow mule to cut the richness. (3/5)   Although I can't say this place is my definite go to for pizza in the neighborhood, their Vico pizza will have me coming back...for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Pizza was okay. Luke warm at best. Logan took my order over the phone and messed up my order and also put me down under a completely different name. He didn't bother apologizing and was overall apathetic at best. Logan: you seem lazy and like you don't like your job- maybe you should get a new one and new attitude. Trish the manager should have corrected him on the spot, she was too busy sitting down socializing at a nearby friend. I guess business is good enough here that anything goes in this place.  I don't know if I'll be back here."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. Great atmosphere too! Also seeing true italians who were there for a long time enjoying their food and their Italian beers has to mean that it must taste like original Italian made pizza. The pizza defenetly tastes like no other pizza I've had before. My girlfriend has been to Italy and she says that it tastes just like it did in Italy. The service was good too. We can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Their website claimed they have a special oven and flour and tomatoes from Italy, so I figured this should be an authentic place for pizza. Husband said this is very authentic compared to the ones in Italy. I never went to Italy but this tastes different than all the pizzas I've ever tried. The crust is definately thin and yummy. We ordered the Settebello pizza, insalata grande and tiramisu. The tiramisu is a must try, they claim it's made in-house. Overall, it was a very satisfying meal. And another plus for me since this was another \"new\" spot I took Husband to during our Vegas trip a few weeks back!"}
{"text":"This is a awesome spot for pizza off the strip.  If you're looking for Italian style pizza crust, look no further.  I've went several times with friends that have lived in Italy and they rave about this place.  The pizza is delicious and the staff are amazing.  Lots of parking available."}
{"text":"I'm Italian and I rarely eat Italian food out but this pizza is the best I have ever had.  It reminds me of the pizza I have eaten in Naples Italy.  They maybe char it a bit too much but that is definitely part of the authenticity.  The quality of all their ingredients is top notch.  Very impressive for such a little town."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite pizza joint, hands down. The service has always been amazing, the atmosphere is comfortable, and the food-delicious. The pizza and the cappuccino are just like everything I've ever had overseas.   Now if they would deliver to my house, I would be in Heaven. And fat."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed picking up a pizza every so often as I have lived minutes from here for years but it is not until recently that I have come to know and enjoy the fantastic experience of dining in. We had a dinner for my moms birthday with a large party of 12 and it was seamless. They both accommodated and served a cake that we brought in addition to flowers balloons and favors. The food is so fresh light and delicious- you can't imagine such a great light taste to pizza!  The daily drink specials make dining here both fun and dangerous. $4 margaritas on Thursdays! Overall- fantastic fresh food with friendly attentive service. The best pizza place in town."}
{"text":"I lived in Italy for eight years, and the pizza served here is; veramente Napoletana!   This is the closest pizza tasting like Italia in Las Vegas, and I miss living up the street from Settebello (Actually, I liked to be back in Italy.)  Other than the meat...many of the ingredients are imported from Italy, -even the pizzaiolo and one of the servers are from Italy.  I always go here when I visit Vegas.  It's also nice that they moved to the District where they can get more business."}
{"text":"Like no other.  It does not fit my description of usual pizza, but I love it!  The Diavola is so good.  It has perfect spice to it.  Only issue would be that each time we go, it is a little different depending on who makes it-- not necessarily a bad thing, but sometimes we like it better than others due to a thicker crust or more toppings that vary based on the pizza maker.  The decor is great.  The beet salad is awesom and huge!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Settebello after work for a relaxing dinner on Sunday evening.  The restaurant was full but we got sat in a booth right away. The waitress was very pleasant and explained how they cook their pizzas.  They are cooked in a 900 degree oven so the crust is crispy and the inside is a little moist.  I order the garden mule, this was very interesting.  It was a spinoff of the Moscow mule with blueberries.  We ordered the warm beet salad and the settebello pizza.  Both were fantastic.  The beets were cooked with goat cheese and pine nuts, the dish came out steaming hot.  The pizza was also delicious.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Lunch with clients, or lunch with my husband. Has been excellent every time! Try the Settebello Special, it is the best. Fresh ingredients, great crust, and the flavor is amazing."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour which is only held in the very small bar area. Bartender was extremely inattentive to us. We had to ask several times on several occasions to get a drink even after putting our empty glasses out towards the bartender to signify we were looking for another drink (which was just a bottle of beer - not like he had to make some foo-foo drink that took 5 minutes to make). Bartender did not explain the way happy hour worked & when we questioned him on it - he gave us attitude. He had originally told us that he had put in our drink order before happy was over but when we asked him to get our order he said that we could pay for another drink if we wanted it instead - it should have been on the happy hour special. Ordered the small pizza with sausage on it - it was so doughy in the middle it was gross & just a floppy mess. He also added my items into another group of people's bill even though I came 45 minutes after them instead of starting my own separate bill. I wouldn't even spend the $5 for happy hour here for food or drink. It's definitely not worth it even if it's not far from my house."}
{"text":"I would like Settebello to consider opening up a restaurant in San Jose, CA. :)  Delicious! Crust was thin, light and chewy! Ordered the Bianca which had white sauce with procuitto, shaves of parmesan and fresh arugula! Scrumptious! Also tried the Settebello which had red sauce, mushrooms and sausage. Very tasty and tomato sauce was light, the sausage was not greasy or heavy."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with some friends on a Friday noon. The place was maybe half full. We ordered the quattro formagio pizza and the settebello with the antipasti appetizer.  The antipasti was very good with 3 kinds of meat, 2 kinds of cheese, artichoke hearts, and garlic flat bread that was very very good.  The pizza here is thin crust, but not crispy... rather doughy. The taste is awesome on both pizzas, but the center part gets soggy which I don't like.  Would come back here with others, but probably not alone as I would not be able to finish one pizza by myself, and would not want to take it home as it will get too soggy."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  My wife and I arrived at around noon and were greeted with smiles and seated immediately. The atmosphere of the place was warm and welcoming, with a nice soundtrack of Italian music playing in the background.  We started our lunch with a Misto antipasto, which was excellent, consisting of two kinds of prosciutto, salami, two kinds of cheeses, olives and pickled zucchini, and accompanied by a delicious focaccia bread. We ordered a pizza each - the wife had the \"Quattro Formaggi\" (four cheeses), which she loved, and I had the \"Settebello\", which was topped with crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil. I'm from New York City, born and bred there for 40 pizza-eating years, so I'm very critical of pizza in general, but I can say that this was, by far, the best tasting, most authentic pizza I have ever had outside of Italy.  Fantastic pizza aside, what really made the visit worthwhile was our server, Tam, who treated us as old friends even though we had never been there before. He patiently explained everything on the menu, answered our questions, made great suggestions and never left us hanging or wanting for anything. This was our first time here, but it definitely won't be our last!"}
{"text":"I vote this place \"Best Pizza outside of Italy\".  Not sure how those chain restaurants managed to ruin pizza, but they did. Go to Settebello & try what a real pizza should taste like. Regain your faith in this dish again by bitting into the delectable thin crust, brick oven baked ingredients.  Interesting Facts: Member of the Vera Pizza Napoletana (VPN). This organization requires that they restaurant only use specific raw ingredients to create the dough, and that the dough be worked only with the hands. Also, the pizza shoul only be cooked directly on the surface of a bell shaped pizza oven that is fueled solely by wood. The organization also requires they use a specific type of tomatoes and only fresh milk or buffalo milk mozzarella is acceptable.  BITE INTO THAT!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I am a pizza snob, but I dont think so I know value and taste, and this place had neither for me. I ordered the Lasagna Pizza and I was the last one to get my pizza in a party of around 15 people. Others who ordered after me got theirs prior, so an \"F for service. then when it fianally arrived, the dough was very dry and rubbery overly chewy and overall very bland tasting pizza. The only reason I inhaled the pie was because by the time I got served, I was starving from waiting such a long time. needless to say after dropping over 25 bucks for one pie and some water, I will not be back there again!"}
{"text":"Started off our meal at Settebello with a Spritz cocktail and then moved onto a fresh beet salad and the Vico pizza.  TheSpritz was very refreshing, and the beet salad was a nice compliment. The colors were beautiful with yellow and bright red beets combined with bitter greens.  The Vico pizza was served with fennel and caramelized red onion. It was cooked perfectly with a beautiful chewy crust.  Unfortunately, they ran out of Panna Cotta for dessert as well as the pistachio gelato.  I still opted for an espresso which was served with a small biscotti. The crema on the espresso was a dark caramel color, and the espresso was very nicely balanced.  Stems up!"}
{"text":"This is excellent Napoli style pizza. Haven't had better anywhere, not even Italy. Great salads and house made gelato. Consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go if you like authentic  pizza... We walked in the place and knew right away this was the real thing... pizza here is more then fresh it's spectacular with fresh ingredients and delicious flavor, just the way we had it in Italy ... Also the service was número uno ! A real cool place in Las Vegas ... Muy bueno ;-)"}
{"text":"Well, after many years of frequenting this restaurant, what seems to happen I feel has.....to begin with the staff is quite young and unattentive, my last experience there was around 6 oclock pm on a Monday, we were one of four in the place for dinner and our two pizzas took an hour to bake, after eating the delicious yet oversized salads, we decided to ask the waiter to bring the pizzas to go because we had to be to a movie by 7:30 and never imagines it would take so long, unfortunately the waiter nodded his head but the pizzas were brought out fresh on plates, making it take even longer to return them and box them up, sadly this is a place I put down in my book as a \"TO GO\" restaurant, because the food is amazing but the service and staff are a bummer."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars. It was....amazing. Everything tasted so fresh. This restaurant was recommended by a friend who recently moved from Italy and she said this is the closest to real Italian pizza bc they get the flour from Italy-as well as a bunch of other ingredients. The menu has info about the grill, how pizza is made, and where the ingredients come from. I got a simple margherita pizza. Whoa. the crust was thin and delicious and there were big pieces of basil all over. The pizza is big too! We each of course finished it we couldnt let it go to waste. I also got a lemon dessert that i had to take tiny  bites of to savor the flavor. I will definitely be coming back here. Often and soon. Oh yes and the service was outstanding. I ordered a water and had to have it filled at least 8 times-we swore the water even tasted better. The pizzas came out quick as well."}
{"text":"The best wood fired pizza I have had outside of Italy. Great thin crust and wonderful toppings. We had two different pizza's and loved both. They are 12\" size so good for 1 person or share with a salad. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Settebello is probably the best pizza in Henderson. It is located in the Whole Foods parking lot of The District. Miss Molly T. and I got our lunch on couple of weeks ago, and both of us were extremely pleased with the drool-worthy pizza.   We decided to split the namesake Settebello Pizza which had crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and extra virgin olive oil ($13.50). The toppings were fresh with quality ingredients and the crust was cooked perfectly, but it is definitely a soft pie like crust. I found it easiest to just fold the slice and eat it that way instead of trying to have the soft crust hold the weight of all the toppings. It was very very tasty. They also have a selection of Italian beers and pasta.  The service was attentive enough and the pizza did take a little while to come out. No they do not deliver."}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever my wife and I come into town (we have a vacation house in Vegas), we always eat at Settebello. The pizzas are made with only fresh ingredients. They are thin crust like they should be in Italy. Perfect size too."}
{"text":"had a nice pie, last nite at settebello.  first time i have been to the new location. same great pizzas the two of us started with a caprese salad,  and couple of peronis. ordered a settebello and diabola pizza,  they were cooked to perfection and very tasty. this place has the best traditional italian style pizza in town by far.  service is great, place is clean and very nice.  finished off with what has to be one of the best tiramisu in town, very light and perfectly flavored. 5 stars all the way,  and its not overly expensive"}
{"text":"I love this place. The pizza is delicious. I don't get that heavy, greasy feeling after I eat here. Sometimes pizza can be over-the-top with cheese coming out of your ears and whatnot. This isn't that kind of place. If you're looking for bar food pizza, look somewhere else.  For the bigger eaters out there, just a heads up: I can put down a whole pizza here without a problem. So if you're ravenously hungry, you should probably go somewhere else. Or get two pizzas! Mmmm..."}
{"text":"We went there late on a Tuesday night. The place was pretty empty. But there was a lot of phone order take-out.   The pizza was very good. One of best we had since Pizza Bianco in Phoenix. Wood fired brick oven delivered a nice charred crust. At first, the char flavor was a little overwhelming and it took a little bit more than a few bite before we started to enjoying them.   We ordered Magherita, and Del Cafone pizza. They both are very good. Del Cafone is sausage, roasted red pepper, onion, and mozzarella without the sauce which was a little dry. We solve the problem by splash some olive oil over the slices before we ate them.  Our favorite course was the appetizer \"caprese\", it was sliced round tomato with sliced fresh mozzarella topped with fresh basil and olive oil. The waitress brought over the appetizer split on two plate without us asking for it, we thought that was very good service on her part.  Overall, the food was wonderful.  I personal think the only reason this place is not packed is because of the price. I mean, all the items on th menu are very affordable, but after the meal I signed for $43 on my credit card. I started thinking if that is just a liitle too much to spend on pizza for two?"}
{"text":"I first tried this pizza joint in Salt Lake City and I feel in love. It is fresh and authentic. The employees at the henderson location are friendly and quick to serve. Each time I have been here, they have not been very busy. I have gotten the diavola pizza. It's a little a spicy with red peppers. So good! Otherwise I had a margharita pizza and it was classic and delicious. I highly recommend going here if you want some delicious and authentic Italian pizza cooked in a brick oven."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows I don't easily give out 5 stars. When it comes to Neopolitan pizza, this pizza gourmet has found heaven. I did take out since I was rushed and had a good red waiting for me at the hotel. My only regret was not having totally hot and fresh at the restaurant. The crust was thin and had a nice stretch. True to Neopolitan vs NY style, the crust was lightly cooked and not crisp and the cheese was not carmelized. The quality of the ingredients was excellent. I had a Davola and they were not skimpy on the ingredients. I would go so far as to say that if they keep this up they rate in my top 20 worldwide. The price was $14 for what I see as a generous personal pizza. I will price it as $$ but really good for the money value."}
{"text":"Oh so delicious!!  Our friends brought us here and I'm so thankful! The service here was on point! Our waiter was so informative and helpful.  Drinks didn't go empty and he did it all with a smile! Awesome!  Now for the food - with my 5 star review you should guess how much we loved it.  The Quattro Formaggi pizza was wonderful topped with fontina, Gorgonzola, mozzarella and parmigiano reggiano.  We also tried the basil pesto pizza topped with strips of pancetta.  This was my favorite! The perfect balance of toppings gave this pizza top prize!   It's easy to fall in love with this pizza place.  This girl sure did!"}
{"text":"I like the ambiance inside, kind of dark, cool lighting, chairs, and decorations. We came with a party of 18 and sat in the back private room, which was very nice.   The waiter was a little confused and would take a couple orders, then leave, then come back, then give some people pizza before he even finished getting everyone's orders.   The food-pizza was gooey and soft in the middle making it hard to pick up (sloppy) and hard to cut (falls apart). I am not sure how you eat this pizza correctly! :)Crust was just right.   We had the Setebello pizza and it was good but I would get something else next time. The friends I was with ordered desserts and although I did not try them, they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here almost weekly since a couple of years now...the place is beautifully furnished, great atmosphere, always clean, and we've never had problems with the service.. the staff is very attentive and friendly.. Sometimes the bartender brings our drinks the moment we sit down because he remembers what we like. The pizza is as authentic Italian as it gets! Thumbs up!  Their gluten free crust is also incredible, you can hardly tell you aren't having the real thing.. Can't go wrong with any of the pizzas, and most of the salads are delicious too! Great selection of and  too."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places where you can have a good meal! Pizza is fresh and it is very tasty! Also if you want meat, you can have misto ... again one of the best. I eat several times here, during the last 2 years. Every time was the same good services and same excellent meal!"}
{"text":"Great service, phenomenal food, tasty drinks!! Cool bar area with a great happy hour too. Rustic & trendy charm. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance!  I have to start with how much I like the vibe in this place! The lighting is perfect, the furniture is comfortable and very pretty. The location is great! The decor is very much my style. Loved everything about how this place looks and feels.   The food is ok. When I walk into a place this pretty I guess I expect more. The misto was ok, doughy focaccia, mild cheeses were ok along with selection of meats. Was looking for bolder Italian flavors. We decided on the margherita pizza because it's my favorite type. It was very doughy. The flavors were fresh and good but I'm looking for more of a crispier & thinner dough. It wasn't bad but didn't live up to my dreams of finding the perfect margherita pizza like the one I had in Italy. Prices are average. Service was great, no complaints there.   My search continues..."}
{"text":"We are absolutely furious with the pizza makers. They burnt all 4 pizzas which is absolutely ridiculous. ONLY GO WHEN AUGUSTINE IS WORKING ALONE. The cooks other than Augustine have burnt every single pizza that I have seen come out of the oven. I saw the two cooks and they both were not paying attention and we're talking to each other while the pizza was cooking. Whether the oven is hot or not, they both burned all of the pizzas that came out of the oven. I would rather pay double for Augustine to make and cook the pizza because he doesn't burn it first of all and the flavor is more deep and the mozzarella is perfectly melted. I feel like I wasted my money and time today because I cannot even eat the crust or the bottom of the pizza because it was all completely soggy and burned. Like what I am left with to eat... The toppings?! I think Augustine should be the main chef at Settebello because he is consistently making perfect pizzas which is the only reason why we go there and gave 5 stars in the past. I will not be going there anymore except on Sunday's when Augustine works there and the two other cooks are not. My point is why should I pay $45 for a couple burned pizzas? Also, I usually don't like to write bad reviews, like last time I was there, there was strand of blonde hair and well what do you know... the pizza was burnt. And of course Augustine was not the cook. If you like burned pizzas this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Closest thing to Neapolitan pizza around and real Mozzarella de Buffalo! Yum"}
{"text":"Just as good as the green valley location, but not as busy for some reason (at least the five times I've been, no wait, plenty of open tables). The location is more spacious and comfortable. The pizza is to die for. I believe it is the best pizza in Las Vegas hands down. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a big favor and give it a shot. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love this pizza! No matter where you are from, NY, Chicago, or wherever else has pizza, come try THiS pizza all the way from Naples Italy. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Dined here once and will never return. While the food was passable, (nothing outstanding but not slop either) the prices and the wait staff will keep me from eating at this restaurant again.  Our pizzas were pretty small and did not contain many ingredients. I understand they serve margherita pizzas, but all the other times I've eaten them I left the table feeling full. This was not the case here. The crust was thin and took up a good portion of the pizza. We wondered why they only sauced about 50% of the pizza. The cheese was tasty, but I would have liked more than a few little pieces on the pizza.  For such a small pizza, the cost was certainly not worth it. I would have no problem if the food was outstanding, but it was just an average pizza. Many other smaller pizzerias in town offer better tasting and larger pizzas for less money than Settebello.  Our waiter was anything but approachable, making it seem like a chore to get a place setting for one person in our group. Throughout the meal, our waiter was rarely seen. He basically took our order and gave us the check. The server who brought our food out was the one to check on us!  I usually try to keep non-food related criticisms to myself, but this restaurant had too many strikes against it not to mention the negatives. I would only dine here again if someone else paid for it, and even then, I would make sure to have a place lined up for food later on."}
{"text":"If you come here expecting pizza with a crisp crust, sauce full of Italian spices and smothered with melted, shredded mozzarella; you will be truly disappointed. Conversely, if you come here with an open mind and ready to experience something new (or if you watched the Naples episode of Anthony Bourdain's \"No Reservations\"), then you will love it.   This pizzeria follows the \"Vera Pizza Napolitana\" guidelines in preparing their pizza (visit their website for an explanation at setebello.net). This results in a pie that has a crisp outer crust, but a soggier middle due to the more viscous sauce and water released from the fresh mozzarella. Which is why the pie is not cut, and eaten with a knife and fork, like they do in Naples.  What we ate: Panzanella salad (light dressing, nice bite from arugula and red onion, and a cool finish with the cucumber), Margherita DOC (clean and simple flavors, tasty crust) and Settebello (tasty sausage and interesting addition of pine nuts) pizza, and Cannoli (crisp shell, authentic ricotta and candied fruit filling).  Service was good and decor was neat and not overdone (was there to eat, not judge interior design). Overall, great experience and now on my \"must go to\" list."}
{"text":"My family and I came in yesterday (party of 8) with no reservation and were sat right away with no problem.  Our server, Tyler, came over and took our order.  Tyler was very knowledgeable on the menu and even had them make a fresh batch of red sangria for me as I am allergic to berries :(    Our food came out and everything we had was AMAZING!  The pizza was light, fresh and PERFECT!  We had a nutella pizza and cannoli for dessert and they too were amazing.    The service here is great!  Tyler and Brandon were the ones who helped our table and they were awesome!!!!!  They are so sweet and have great personalities, I will definitely request them when I come back!"}
{"text":"I met a group here so the choice was not mine.  The menu was a little pricey for what you received.  I ordered one of the pizzas.  The waiter prefaced that \"everyone should really get their own as they are personal size and not big enough for sharing\".  Um, my friend wanted salad anyway, so no one to share with me, but for sharing it was 2-3 people worth anyway.  Except that this was the worst, flimsiest pizza I have ever had.  The so-called crust was thin and soggy and then the crust was burned black on purpose, which was too much.  So I ate one piece and brought home the leftovers to my husband who will eat anything.  He looked at me and said, this is the worst pizza ever without me even saying anything to him.    I will say though, awesome, attentive waiter.  Our drinks were never empty.  That is all I can say positive about this place.  Not returning."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in vegas.... Period! Consistently tasty & fresh good ingredients! You can taste the quality.  The pizzas are mouth watering and will fulfill any choosy sauce opinionated type, it's more of a \"Fresca\" Napoli style pizzas. I love their warm beet salad with marcona almonds & goat cheese. (On the happy hour menu too) This place is Super great and highly underestimated! They have happy hour too that's definitely worth going those times."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Las Vegas. I usually go with the marinara (no cheese) or margharita. Simple. Classic. Delicious. They in insalata grande is perfect to split for 3-4 ppl and they make a yummy limoncello shot. If you're there in the summer, the patio is nice before it gets hotter than hades."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 6 or 7 times over the last year.  Good pizza, most of the time, more on that (and the reason it's not 5 stars)  The good: diavola pizza paired with their chosen Italian beer is great.  Sauces have good flavor, meats and cheese tops notch.  Great thin authentic Italian pizza crust and taste.  Really great Italian beers that are hard to find in the US.  The bad:  it's not consistent.  Staff seems to be mostly college-age kids and both the food and service varies dramatically.  This trip my pizza had slightly to severely burnt crust all the way around and the staff didn't seem to concerned to fix it.  Service also varies in the same way.  The really great Italian beers---they run out of them, all the time, a real bummer.  Id still recommend it, but be warned your experience could be great, mediocre, or just plain bad depending on the staff that day.  If you're cost sensitive - skip it.  It's pricey."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant a while back and I have to say this place is a huge disappointment, when we went and we were seated at a table that was in a corner we were with our three kids my wife and my mother and the table was too small it also slid all over the concrete floor which sucked  They notified us upon being seated that their credit card machine wasn't going to work which just created a lot of hassle and inconvenience   I ordered my pizza without any artichoke hearts and of course when it arrived it had artichoke hearts I didn't bother sending it back because it wasn't even worth doing, the other issue was that they don't give you any fair warning about the pepperoni that they use on their pizza for kids pepperoni that pepperoni was really spicy and the kids wouldn't eat it .  They should say something and tell you that before you order it.  The food is overpriced for what you get and the ingredients themselves including the crust and everything else is just a low quality compared to other restaurants that occupy this sort of sector / case in point would be due forni which smokes this place, you shouldn't even bother to go here,  worth it and I'll never come here again while duo forni is open, don't be fooled"}
{"text":"The worse pizza I have ever had hands down. Dough taste like a tortilla no flavor on pizzas at all. And maybe it's just me but I'd never have canned tomatoes and bags for flour as a display in any restaurant I work in. The one star is for the warm beats those were not bad teach the cooks to season better and they'd be good"}
{"text":"Best pizza in LV? Maybe, I am still a big fan of Grimaldis. The pizza is more Italian-Napoletana style. Very saucy and the crust is one of the best you'll ever eat. The cheese is fresh and sauce is probably the best pizza sauce ever. The saucyness of the pizza can be a turn off to some folks. I really don't think that Napoletana pizza works with topping on top.   I highly recommend that you order Margherita pizza, especially the one with Buffalo Mozzarella. I also tried the Caprese salad for an appetizer. It was delicious. The quality of mozzarella is excellent and favlorfull. During weekdays they have drink specials from 3-6. Its B1G1."}
{"text":"Waited a while to try this place out because it's out of the way for me.  Finally had the chance to try this place out.  I wish I came sooner!  Their moscato was one of the better ones I've had.  I ordered the Settebello pizza and it was absolutely delicious!  Service was very attentive as well."}
{"text":"The pizza at Settebello is amazing and there are so many unique toppings to choose from.  Settebello offers pizza and salads (and a full bar) but this is an amazing Italian atmosphere to relax and enjoy great food and service!"}
{"text":"Settebello has authentic Italian-style thin crust pizza.  (You have to ask to have it sliced, or you get an uncut pizza).  They only have one size pizza and it is for an individual and served on a white China plate. The pizza is generally very good, unless they char the bottom crust, which has happened to me several times.  There is an assortment of toppings available, that are not usually available at most pizza places.  They have a fabulous dessert with chocolate, caramel and peanut butter ice cream. Service is inconsistent."}
{"text":"A friend and I came across this place hoping to eat something before a movie. The menu looked good and they were able to seat us right away. The decor  and the whole vibe was really cool.  Our server Juan was very friendly, personable and had good menu knowledge. We ordered a bottle on Kim Crawford which was yummy and started with a caprese salad. It was good but pretty basic. I would have like a bit more basil but I would definitely have it again and maybe ask for a bit of extra basil. We shared a margarita pizza. It was good. A bit doughy for a thin pizza. Too much crust but maybe that appeals to most Americans. But the dessert..... Was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! The tiramisu was the best ive ever had!  They also had an espresso machine which we took advantage of!  We were able to have a full meal within an hour and fifteen minutes and were able to make our movie on time. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Settebello to meet with family, that was in town. I'm not a pizza person, and I went there thinking it was an \"Italian Restaurant.\"   From the exterior it's a very attractive restaurant. The interior decorations are as equally appealing.  I found the menu VERY hard to understand! I know I wasn't the only one in our party who felt that way.  The staff was fabulous! As our glasses became empty, they were quickly filled! The waitress was very informative, friendly and patient.  My main problem was that I don't like salad, expensive appetizers, or pizza... That's all they serve!   As far as the flavor of the food, it was good. But the consistency of the dough was horrible! It was equivalent to my first attempt at making a pizza, not very good!  Had they had some Pasta Options, Soup options, and a more understandable menu, they would've earned a better rating! The only reason they got a 2 instead of 1, was because the level of service!  I'll probably never return again!"}
{"text":"Margherita Doc pizza was DELICIOUS, some of the best I've had, and we had GREAT service!!! Our waitress Natalia was fantastic and very informative...great first time experience :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza I had in a long time. Actually, I'm not sure when I had a really good pizza. Period.  We ordered the Margherita and Settebello pizzas. Also, antipasta misto appetizer.  Misto-I love the variety of sampling of Italian meats, veggie & cheese. It was a pretty big portion and very tasty!!  Margherita pizza-I wish we ordered something new because I already know how this was going to turn out. It was pretty good and the tomato sauce were tasty. Settebello-Now, this one...I'm in-love with! I loved the sausage sliced on my pizza! I wasn't to sure about having pine nuts in my pizza but, boy, it was divine!!! The texture, taste, blend in so well together!  All I know, I have to go back and try the others!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza!! The capricciosa is my favorite! Service does lack at times but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  I came here because Stefany brought up the peach and Prosciutto pizza special for the week.  I must have came at just the right time...and was seated at a really, really uneven and wobbly table. While I waited , i asked the waitress to try and put something underneath so that it wouldnt be constantly moving throughout dinner.  Well..... it did.   It is VERY loud in the restaurant.  I felt like i had to shout to have a conversation with someone 6 inches away from me.  We ordered the prosciutto wrapped arugula,  which is like a little mini salad. Its about the length of a hot dog, and was a little dry for me.... i will ask for extra balsamic reduction on next time.  The peach and Prosciutto pizza wasnt on special....bummer. so, we opted for the pear and jalapeño pizza. We asked for the pizza to be cut.  Pizza came. And i am seriously wondering if they used a plastic knife to try and cut this pizza. Because when we tried to grab a slice.... we really had to tug and pull...and the toppings and cheese just slid right off.  Oooohhhhhh... And they do NOT have ranch. Not at all. So, save yourself the embarrassment of asking.  For being a thin crust pizza...it was really doughy. No crispiness, at all... dont get me wrong, it was a perfect salty, sweet, with a little bit of spice to it..but it just had no texture.  I would say i would come back."}
{"text":"Meh, ok pizza soggy in the middle flavor was ok  Wife's pizza was extremely burned. Soggy in the middle as well  I get the idea behind Napoli pizza, just this was overpriced and under delivered  Salad was very tasty and the service  was good.  Looks like most people just go to drink wine. Maybe it helps get the pizza down."}
{"text":"This was an awesome experience. My wife had worked for an Italian restaurant, Pizzaria Guido, in our hometown...owned and frequented by Italians. And the food here was as good as 'her' restaurant.  The wait people were excellent, attentive and fast. The food was totally awesome. We each had a pizza and there was just too much for us to finish a whole pizza per person. So we had leftovers for lunch the next day.   Highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"Came here for date night. First impression was great atmosphere and decor. Got the artichoke pizza and prosciutto pizza with arugula. The artichoke pizza was soggy and not cooked all the way. The prosciutto pizza had too much arugula as you can see in the picture. Would come again, but only for happy hour. Was really disappointed considering I've heard so many good things about this place."}
{"text":"Settebello's is tucked back a bit. In The District's East side, it shares a parking lot with Whole Foods and Cheesecake Factory.  IT IS WELL WORTH LOOKING FOR!   The Margherita pizzas are plenty big for two people. Just about any topping you can think of not your usual run of the mill cardboard box pizzas. The desserts are excellent, Gelatto and Tiramisu are what we tried. They were priced between 5 and $10.  The staff is very attentive. I wouldn't go here for a romantic outing as it can be quite busy. Definitely friends or just a good night out. Very clean too!"}
{"text":"People rave about this pizza but it just doesn't do it for me. It comes out seemingly not cooked enough. You lift up the pizza and the cheese slides off. Weird texture to me. Have eaten here a few times when friend invite me, but I'll pass on the invite from now on. I always leave hungry cause I wasn't satisfied."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! We've been to Italy and this is the real thing. I always order the Margherita pizza, the dough is just perfect."}
{"text":"Ahhh Settebello. I have fallen in love with you like everyone else. So here is another 5 star review. Whoopee!   This is my kind of pizza place. Amazing food, great value, friendly service, and intimate setting. If you like extremely greasy, loaded on cheese, Pizza Hut style pizza, stop reading now because this place is too good for you.  Settebello has the perfect crust where the edges are fluffy yet crispy, and the rest is thing and delicious. They are constantly adding new pizzas to the menu and always are great. House made, fresh ingredients and never overdoing the sauce OR the cheese. I am truly happy after devouring a pizza with my husband here. My personal favorite, the Diavola and they have one currently with Jalapeño jelly that is the best white pizza I've ever had. I'm not even a huge fan of white pizza.   The salads and the appetizers are to die for. When I can get a salad that consists solely of arugula and no other greens, I'm a happy girl.   Settebello you continue to impress. Keep doing you."}
{"text":"This place makes me smile! I can not wait to come back and try more! We went this Friday evening around 8pm and it was packed. Seated in a corner table, our server was very nice. To my left was a large party of Italian speaking adults. It was almost as if they set the ambiance for us. You could hear the older lady just going on and on. I do not know if they are affiliated with the business or not but it made our 4 star experience a 5 star!   We started with the caprese and an order of focaccia bread. You can tell a lot from a caprese because of the simplicity of this dish. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe, the mozzarella creamy and the olive oil just flavorful enough. I cracked some sea salt and pepper onto the top and was in heaven.   The focaccia was not the bread I am used to. It was wonderful, but I was looking forward to the thick chewy bread I love. My husband said this was more traditional and he devoured it.  We then ordered our first pizza. The Settebello because if you are going to name a dish after yourself it should be the best you have. And it was! The prosciutto was incredible. It makes my mouth water thinking about it! the small sliced sausage cooked to perfection. I even loved the tomato sauce. Just a very light sauce.  Our next pizza was the Bianca. This was my husbands favorite. It had fresh arugula draped over the top, not tomato sauce but creamy amazing cheese.  Then we had dessert. A lemon tart with the most amazing crust. It was thick and flaky and heavenly.   I can not wait to return with friends!"}
{"text":"As close to true Neapolitan Pizza as I've had in Vegas.  Unlike North Italia, the crust is slightly chewy with that sourdough edge and just the right amount of leoparding on the crust.  It's consistency is more true than that of the pizzas I've had at due forni.  The toppings are more in line with traditional Italian dishes.  I was very happy with the pizzas.    Prices were not only fair, but the happy hour deals made it a bargain.  Excellent service from our server Adrian.    Will be making regular return visits for sure."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Even though I didn't love the  Quattro Stagioni pizza I had last time that much because of the taste of one of the cheeses I knew that besides that I would probably hv better luck nxt time.  I have an Italian friend and claims this is the closest to real Italian pizza she has tried in the US. Small but good menu.  The reason I don't give more stars is because the service has been just standard but we keep coming back for the food.  This time we enjoyed both the insalata and the Emilia pizza.  Like the simplicity of their menu and not too slow service."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 pizza places.  My favorite is the Diavola.  Great crust like a traditional Neapolitan pizza should be. Thin, yet chewy with but of crunch in the crust."}
{"text":"Great Neopolitan Pizza, Brings back memories of my youth in Naples in the 60's. It even had a sign with the street were I lived on the wall. I had the Margarita Pizza, the classic Neopolitan pie. It was perfecto."}
{"text":"Wow I am so happy that the Bolognese is permanently on the menu!!! By far the best sauce that we have ever tasted!!! We still love the other pizzas but this quickly won as our new favorite pizza! There is no doubt why this was crowned the best pizza in Nevada!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious pizza. And i am very picky about my pizza. Lovely server. Clean atmosphere. Also good for take out service!"}
{"text":"I'd never been before but a friend constantly raves about the place so when visiting this time, we made this the final gathering place for the trip. The staff was very friendly and helpful and saw to it that we got a great seat for our party of 10.  First stop? The bar while waiting for the rest to arrive. The wine list is somewhat limited with only a few whites by the glass. Fortunately my favorite white was on the list. Pinot Grigio. It was nice and dry, not sweet, with a fruity linger. Very good stuff.  The server in the bar was friendly and when he asked us if we wanted \"water\" I knew immediately he wasn't from Las Vegas. I pegged him from New York. Brooklyn even. He told us he was from Brooklyn so I asked him to say water again just so I could hear it. Where I come from when you say water, you're speaking a different language.  As our party arrived and we moved into the main dining area, we were promptly seated without a reservation. They were very accommodating and friendly. Service was impeccable and she provided a nice flow to the whole situation. If I could give just the server a star rating, it would be 5, no doubt.  I started off with another glass of Pinot to go along with my salad. We shared a beet salad and the Insalata Grande, which in my opinion was the better of the two. This might have been one of the best salads I've ever had: Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Pizza? Yes Pizza. On rare occasions I'm willing to violate my glutard status. We didn't know until after arriving that you have to ask for gluten-free a day in advance because that's what they need to prepare it. I think they're pickier than I. At any rate, we had the  Margherita DOC: Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I think in order to truly enjoy this pizza you have to be a fan of the crust. This stuff was ultra thin and a bit chewy. I'm not saying I didn't like it, I'm just saying you would have to be a fan to truly enjoy it. It's not something you can pick up and bite but something you have to eat with a fork. For a lot of pizza aficionados, that's practically sacrilege.   In the end and for me: The dining experience gets 5 stars, the service 5, and the pizza 4. Sooo, I'm going to give it 4 stars because you just have to go and check it out for yourself. Is it yea or nay on the pizza? That's what Settebello is all about, the pizza. I will say here though, that the VPN (Vera Pizza Napoletana) certification is impressive. The requirements are as follows: The VPN charter requires that members use only specific raw ingredients to create the pizza dough, that the dough be worked with the hands, never using a rolling pin and that it be cooked directly on the surface of a bell shaped pizza oven that is fueled solely by wood. The charter also requires specific types of tomatoes be used and only the use of fresh milk or buffalo milk mozzarella is acceptable. Settebello is one of only 5 pizza establishments in the country to be certified by the Napolitana pizza police from Italy. I guess that says a lot."}
{"text":"Went to the GV recommendation of a friend. This pizza reminds me of pizza I had in Italy. We had the Settebello pizza with pine nuts pancetta, mushrooms sausage- so good! And the salad was great too .. But don't remember the name and the tiramisu was perfect!!  The pizza doesn't come precut and don't compare to NY pizza .. it's in a class by it's own."}
{"text":"I give this place a four for the food. There were four of us arriving around 5:30 on a Friday. It was a little busy but got right in and seated. Had salad and pasta dish. Both were very good. Had a few drinks during happy hour. Service was good, well, up until we were asked to move to the bar because they needed the table. Relaxing/eating/enjoying a couple cocktails for about 90 minutes. Guess that was too long...hmm! Never had that happen before. Actually we were quite shocked. We just said we were leaving and did just that. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"First off the place is beautiful!  Its brand new, modern, but also rustickly charming.  The menu has more options than Settebello Green Valley.  Although Christy, the manager over all the settebellos, said that the Green Valley location would soon be adding the new menu.    I love their food! It is definitely one of my favorite places to eat. I lived in Italy for 2 years and at the really nice pizzerias in Italy, this is how the food tastes.  Here are my favorite dishes. The insalata Grande, the beet salad, the crustini con crudo, and my favorite pizza is the settebello.  Their desserts are out of this world! My favorites are the Nutella pizza, the s'mores calzone , and they have this salt caramel pudding with an armaretto cookie. That armaretto cookie when it comes fresh out of the oven is one of the best things I've ever tasted.  If you love real Italian pizza and real Italian food then you will love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service here is always friendly and charismatic. Since their products are imported from Italy, the pizza definitely tastes authentic. The pizza itself is really thin so even though it has a sizable diameter, I can eat the whole thing. For my tennis playing brothers, a whole pizza is not quite filling for them, however. I was a little disappointed the last time I went because there was a lingering burnt taste in every bite. Normally, the dough is amazing and the delicious cheese and tomato sauce is hard to beat. So we hope for improvement the next time around."}
{"text":"This place had such potential. Good location. Nice ambiance. But we have had a couple of bad experiences now and won't be going back.  1. There is no pepperoni. 2. Their salads taste like a pine tree and not in a good way.  3. The service was really slow. We finally got out of there after 2 1/2 hours. We went on a weekend night and there were only a few other people dining, but we were not attended to very well. There were multiple waiters but refills were neglected.  4. The pizza just wasn't that great. Project pie, Grimaldis, biaggios, and other pizza places in Vegas are a lot better.  5. The waiter had a difficult time splitting the checks.  6. We both got sick from what we ate and had stomach issues all night. TMI We will not be going back. But in all fairness, if you still want to try it, at least they have coke products and their bathrooms are nice."}
{"text":"After having lived in Naples for two years, this is the best (read, authentic) Italian pizza I've had. Well worth the trip - my favorite, the Emilia"}
{"text":"Although the location is less-than-obvious, the Neapolitan pizza is terrific.  The service is much better than you might expect from a casual place like Settebello.  And the dessert pizza, with Nutella, looks tasty."}
{"text":"Well, we just stopped by again for our usual first lunch in Las Vegas, or should I say Henderson. Settebello has always treated  us well over the years. The quality of the pizza is consistent and always varied as they usually have some specials on offer. Today I ordered the vico, which comes with roasted fennel, sausage, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil and olio. Not you're traditional American pie at all, but flavorful and delicious.  The wife chose the margherita DOC, which comes with the real deal mozzarella di bufala. Again her pizza was delicious with just the perfect chewy crust and balanced with the light tomato sauce. I was all caffeined out, but the wife got an espresso. Their coffee and espresso is also the real deal, if you need a pick me up.  The service is usually great, but it can get hectic if they are slammed. Usually the pizza comes out quick due to the thousand degree wood oven, so they are pretty efficient. Like I said, Settebello is a pretty standard place to visit whenever we are in Las Vegas, so we will be back again and again."}
{"text":"If Settebello wanted me to write in their high school yearbook this is what I would say.  Remember that one time we ditched Whole Foods and went to eat pizza instead? That was the best.  Your cool. Don't ever change. See you soon!"}
{"text":"I like thin crust pizza, but more crispy would be better.  I had the marghrita and it was too oily and soggy for my taste.  Salame plate was excellent.  Service was mediocrity at best.  Felt rushed out door.  No offer for dessert or coffee.  Oh well.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"We saw this place across the street when shopping for running shoes and we figured we would give it a try.   Oh my,  the meatball appetizer is absolutely delicious.  The pizza was pretty darn good too.  I love pizza and I'm always on the hunt for the best one out there but this kind of pizza doesn't seem like THEE pizza for me. The crust is thin and overcooked and the rest of the pizza is extremely thin.  Be cautious when taking a slice because it will flop down and your toppings will slip off.  Don't get me wrong,  I will definitely come back and try more,  because delicious will always be delicious."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The salad I ordered was kind of lacking, but lets be honest that my my error, you don't go here to order salads. The pizza was perfection. Great light and fluffy chew tot the crust. The base was light thin with. Slight crisp. The sauce to cheese and toppings trio was balanced. Great pizza!"}
{"text":"I'd eat here everyday if it wasn't so far from my house.  Definitely a different texture than NY pizza or any other kind of pizza but it is DAMN GOOD.  Mouth is salivating a bit as I write this review"}
{"text":"Finally made it out here for happy hour, celebrating the end of the school year! Surprised to see that they only had one other table during our visit, so service was fast.  Ordered a Dogfishhead IPA ($3 off during HH), and each of the following dishes for a mere $5 each: bruschetta appetizer, warm beets \"snack\", and the Margherita and Vico mini pizzas. For $25 before tip, this was a filling but light early dinner.  The apps were delish: bruschetta is my BF's favorite, and here the crostini is topped with bacon and there's a side of pesto for extra flavor, too. The warm beets were divine and flavorful, served in a mini cast-iron dish and topped with peanuts.   The mini pizzas weren't that mini- don't know the size compares with their usual since this was our first visit, but server let us know that the usual pizzas are 12\" and intended to be an individual size due to the thinness of the crust style. Ordering two mini pizzas (maybe 8\"?) was enough for us to share without feeling like we were going to explode afterward.  Margherita style was my favorite, as the classic tomato-and-cheese combo is just what I naturally crave when I think of pizza, and I love the complementary flavors of fresh basil. BF preferred the Vico, with sausage, fennel, mozzarella, moscarpone, and red onions- quality ingredients and good depth of flavor. While he liked this topping combination better, my dude simply didn't love the thin, wet crust style served here and it may be tricky to get him back in.  Will be coming back soon to try the Moscow Mule cocktail and the Emilia pizza- possibly on my own!"}
{"text":"Don't judge!! DOC certified genuine and authentic Neopolitan Pizza. Drove 30 mins outside the strip to get here. Best pizza in Vegas at any price point. Don't be fooled by the strip. It starts with the dough. Serious flavor in the crust. If you love pizza and you want authentic this is the place. You are welcome. Oh and if you have diabetes DON'T come here because you'll eat it all. I had the brisket pizza. OMG can I cuss on Yelp?? It's F'in awesome!!"}
{"text":"When I crave for pizza, I Crave for Pizza!! At first, I was thinking delivery from one of the chain pizzas or a mom & pop spot in my  area. I wanted to try somewhere new and I didn't want Chicago or NY style pizza (not that I don't like these types).. I thought Sammy's woodfired, CPK.. but they served the usual americanized pies and I've been there and done that as well. So, after doing some research here on Yelp, I found this place and it was Exactly what I was looking for!  I ordered 2 PIzzas  1. Settebello: crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven roasted fennel sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, extra virgin olive oil  - I had to order this since they named it after the restaurant! Besides, the toppings sounded more than satisfying. It was Absolutely Divine! Everything from the dough, sauce and toppings were of high quality and was created with such harmony! Pine nuts.. Yeah, they were a nice touch. The only thing is that most of the toppings were placed towards the center and one of the slices didn't have much cheese on it.  2. Carbonara: crushed tomatoes, pancetta, egg, fresh mozzarella, basil, parmegiano-reggiano, extra virgin olive oil  - I loved the simplicity of the toppings and the addition of an egg. Now, it may not sound like much was put into this pie but they didn't have to put much at all. Due to their superb ingredients/toppings, a little went a long way! I engulfed this 'individual' sized dish in record time!   Dessert:  Tiramisu: Silky smooth! One of the creamiest and masterly balanced flavors that was subtle yet soooo luscious!!   * Not only are Most of their ingredients imported from Italy, Even their Freakin' Oven is Italian!! You won't find a conveyor belt or deck oven here!   * Just a note, they do not have Pepperoni!  Authentic, Gourmet Pizza with High Standard ingredients and True Italian baking! This place was a Real Treat!! But the sametime not a place I would often go to fulfill my pizza cravings.. I won't be filled with 1 pizza alone as their toppings were lacking but not because they were cheap but because that's their style and thats the proper way of serving their type of pizza. Not to take anything away from this fabulous place but I may just be accustomed more towards the mainstream pies!"}
{"text":"The place was great! The staff was very helpful and attentive and the food was great! I ordered the Settebello pizza and it came out so quickly! I would definitely come here again, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  You can always plan on an authentic Italian dining experience here. Fresh salads, pizza & cocktails. You can't go wrong coming to Settebello!!"}
{"text":"The pizza and dessert was great! I would suggest this restaurant to anyone. Though I wasn't crazy about their Nutella pizza, I would definitely come back for any of their pizzas. They are freshly made and I love how it taste like home."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Settebello and it was definitely my last.  One of the reasons I am willing to pay for over priced pizza is because they offer gluten free crust. The other reason I came here was because I love Nutella on a pizza for a dessert and this is one of the few places where they offer it. My friend and I decided to split a pizza for dinner and intended to share a Nutella pizza for dessert. I ordered the gluten free pizza and told the waiter that we would also be ordering a dessert pizza. After we ate the first pizza, I told the waiter that we were ready to order the dessert pizza. He said, \"I hope you didn't want that gluten free, we don't offer it.\" I corrected him and told him I had eaten a gluten free Nutella pizza there before and I knew they offered it. He went to check with the kitchen and then came out and told me they would not sell me a gf dessert pizza because \"they we were running out of gluten free crusts and they were saving them for regular pizza orders.\" Seriously?! I am PAYING for the pizza, plus I am paying the ridiculous up charge for a gluten free crust.  Apparently their idea of customer service does not include serving customers who want gluten free pizza unless they want to order the $20 pizza versus the $16 dessert pizza.  Well, don't worry Settebello, I won't be bothering you with requests for gluten free pizza again."}
{"text":"Always amazing.  The Diavola pizza with chili oil added is *kisses fingertips* deliziosa, and the Bianca (arugula, prosciutto, parmigiano Reggiano) is delightful.  The Nutella pizza with strawberry is uh-mazing.  UH-MAZING."}
{"text":"With all the fantastic pizza places here, I can't help but base my rating off ratings I've given to other pizza spots. This was our first visit to this location and my rating is probably closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I didn't think our experience was worth 4 stars.   We were seated quickly and ordered the meatballs and capricciosa pizza. The meatballs were just ok, a little bland without the sauce, but the bread that accompanied it was good. In theory I liked all of the ingredients in the pizza - artichoke, prosciutto, olives, mushrooms, mozzarella, basil. What's not to like? But together, it didn't really work. I think if they used black olives instead of kalamata and chopped the artichoke hearts a bit smaller (instead of huge chunks), and added more mushrooms and prosciutto, it would've been 10 times better. I do like the thin crust and cooking it in a wood fired oven gives it a rustic flavor.  Service was decent, not great, not terrible. We probably won't be going back anytime soon though :/"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in the Las Vegas!  I have friends that swear by Grimaldis.... but I have yet to try it and compare. I will let you know when that time comes! (possibly tonight!) I used to be a sucker for Chicago-style deep dish pizza UNTIL I ate at Settebellos!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Naples-style thin doughy crust pizza. I got a classic margherita pizza with basil and prosciutto crudo on top. YUMMMMYYY!!! I literally almost ate every single piece, but decided to take one piece home for a late night snack.  My favorite thing to do is eat the whole slice.... then take the doughy crust and dip it into a plate of olive oil with a bit of balsamic, fresh red pepper flakes, and parmesan. SOOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"So this pizza was really interesting. Gluten-free pizzas in other restaurants usually taste like really bad microwaved pizzas, but Settebello's recipe was totally different. Their gluten free pizza had like a naan bread base (which is probably just Napoli-style; I have never had it before, though, and that's the closest comparison I can draw!) and fresh ingredients piled on top of it. They're definitely not American pizzas; they have a very authentic Italian taste (especially the sauce). The hostess said pretty much anything on the menu can be made gluten free for just $4 extra, which was incredibly accommodating. My friend and I went at around 5PM on a Sunday, and it wasn't very crowded and service was incredibly quick (the pizzas came around 10 minutes after we ordered). The ambiance was really nice, too; it's very tastefully decorated and would probably make a great date night."}
{"text":"Stunningly good find in vegas for gourmet pizza.  Prices were quite reasonable too, which is hard to find in this city.  Got the magherita for the kids and the diavola (pepperoni and roasted red pepper), both were perfect with flavorful crust."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I have had in North Las Vegas/Las Vegas/Henderson so far.   My mom and I drove over to The District and saw this lil gem.  I had the Margherita Pizza Con Peppered Salame (Pepperoni) and My mom had the Carbonara Pizza. We both LOVED IT!   Definitely want to eat the pizza fresh, because of all the fresh ingredients. We had a carafe of Sangria (great price!) and enjoyed the pizza. Came out extremely fast (even though I put a custom ingredient on my pizza). Still talking about it today. Yum!   Cannot wait to go back (even though I live over 30 minutes away!)"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza!! And my favorite waitress Trish! Happy Hour specials are the best! Weekly pizza special is always delicious. Reminds us of Italy excellent makers of my favorite aperitif Negroni"}
{"text":"I have been to Settebello a few times for lunch and have always left satisfied and impressed. They have an extremely high quality product at a reasonable price and will definitely continue to visit on a regular basis. This is undoubtedly authentic Neapolitan style pizza paired with so much more for a full dining experience.   The interior is understated and industrial, warmed with marble tables and comfortable seating. It reminds me of a no frills- let the product speak for itself east coast pizzeria.   I love their lunch options because they offer any pizza on the menu lunch sized and lunch priced at $9, or the classic Marg at $7. The menu features classic pizza styles and many specialty varieties; my personal favorite is the brisket pizza. The flavors are smoky and spicy, complemented by the creamy cheese and chewy, slightly charred crust. I have also tried the Panzanella arugula salad; the flavors are really good, but for my taste the bread component was a little too soft (not enough like a crouton) and ended up soaking up too much of the vinaigrette dressing, making them a bit soggy.   The full bar is a huge perk for me! And not always a given at a pizza restaurant. They have a great happy hour as well and all day, daily specials on top of that. Mule Monday's and Margarita Thursday's will ensure I'm a long time patron!   In my honest opinion, the service etiquette is standard at best, sometimes maybe even a little detached and perfunctory; but at the end of the day, it is a pizza restaurant, service has always been accurate and never caused any inconvenience or issues so it's not something that dramatically affects the experience- I'm there for the incredible pizza, not for a 5-star service acumen."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best brick oven pizza I've ever eaten in my life. Whatever they're doing, it's done right.   Ordered the focaccia and it was delicious. Nice and warm and salty with a dip of olive oil, sea salt and oregano - perfection! It's a nice opener for the rest of the carbs you'll be consuming here.  I've also had the insalata grande and it was nice and filling for a salad. Love the pine nuts and shaved Parmesan, so delicious and fresh.  The topper here, though, is the pizza. Using a precise method this pizza is cooked right. Nice burnt edges, crispy and gooey. I had to eat my quattro formaggi with a fork! So delicious. I dislike Gorgonzola immensely, but it was a really subtle flavor here, luckily (as I didn't notice it was one of the four cheeses).   I've also had the gelato and it was divine, the taste was comparable to the gallons I ate in Rome!  This place is close to my house so I have to cover my eyes when I see it or I'll eat here all the time!    The only, only thing I dislike about this place is that, while the employees are super nice and give great service, they have this REALLY annoying habit of correcting pronunciation. I, for one, think that's horrible customer service when it's so obvious what someone is trying to order. Correcting someone is just condescending to me. Change that one little, tiny thing and this place would be absolutely divine perfection!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 830pm, not very busy. Ordered a latte (which was very good) and for the appetizer ordered the Focaccia (which was good. They offer you vinegar and oil with which we declined). For dinner we ordered the Pizza Bolognese (it was just right and very tasty.  The service was very good. Unfortunately like most places in LV they use tap water, which had an effect on my rating.  It was not crowded whatsoever on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Easily some of the best pizza we have ever had! An absolute must try for those who appreciate substance over quantity. If your a Numero Uno type, you might want to skip it."}
{"text":"Good thin pizza.  The pizzas were not as crispy as the other Napoli certified places we've tried, but damn good.  This is what pizza should be.  Every time I eat a pizza like this, I want to commit retail terrorism and burn a pizza hut/papa johns/dominos to the ground.    I had the Diavola and my wife had the Settebello.  Both were amazing.  They came out and were really large, but they're so thin it wasn't a problem.  This is the type of pizza I crave."}
{"text":"This location in The District is warm and inviting. It has a small bar area and then a dining area, primarily with booths. It's lots of wood and cool art. Good ambiance and decor.  They have a pretty thorough cocktail, wine, and beer list. The menu has appetizers, salads, etc. But, of course, the pizza is the star here. What I like most is that their pizzas are unique. The combinations they create are things you'd never think of. And that makes it difficult to decide on a pizza.  On my latest visit, I opted for a pizza with gorgonzola, prosciutto, and chopped almonds. It was seriously delicious!  A pizza is small enough that a super hungry person can eat it all in one sitting (as did my dining partner). For me, though, I ate half and took half home. And it was still delicious reheated.   The staff were friendly and attentive. Our drinks were never empty, which I always appreciate.   All in all, a great place for pizza!"}
{"text":"We actually came here for work with the intention of just unwinding with a few drinks at the bar. But after discovering that they had a second Happy Hour going on from 8PM-9PM Monday through Friday, we decided to take advantage. Lots of tasty pizzas for $5! This is a good way to try the variety of pizzas that they have and not feel like you wasted money if you happen to not like what you got. They might not have been the best pizza around, but for $5, they were just fine! The bartender (I forgot his name) was awesome. He was very engaging and our food came out right away. Actually, I can't believe those pizzas came out that quickly. I'm almost afraid to ask. Ignorance is bliss.  There is plenty of seating everywhere. Lots of tables and space.  Good service, late happy hour, and tasty, cheap food = 4 stars. I'll probably be back very soon."}
{"text":"The margharita pizza was delicious!  Lots of great flavors, not soggy and just really good pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place and the food as well. Great service. The pizza I had today was amazing. I recommend this place to everyone. For sure, you'll be really satisfied."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow!! This is definitely the best pizza I've EVER had! The atmosphere is very nice and pleasant. The service is great, and the thin crust margherita pizza is absolutely delicious!! I will be coming here a lot more !!"}
{"text":"Capricciosa and  settebello are my favorite! I dont feel fat even after finishing the whole thing! Lol! Involtini is yummy and their gelatos are refreshing! I do feel that the henderson location is better than summerlin."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Naples style pizza, this is the place for you.  I have been a customer since they were on Horizon Ridge Pkwy and have taken all my friends and house guests to Settebello.   The high quality ingredients are amazing and the service is outstanding.  My favorite items are the house salad, the foccacia, and the pizza lasagna.  Fabulous!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Well how bout I start with I got what I expected. Meaning after reading numerous Yelp reviews about how the pizza is either a hit or a miss because of the wet or uncooked pizza dough. I could see why some people wouldn't care for it. For me I knew it was going to be like that so I guess I wasn't as disappoint as oppose to someone who wasn't expecting soggy center.   I came right when they open first customer of the day. The restaurant itself is super cool, very rustic and stylish. Classy with lots and lots of space. The bar to the left is a great size with flat screen TVs. The kitchen is sort of open with an awesome oven for pizza prepping. I also notice a nice size private dinning room which can be closed off to the rest of the Resturant.   We were greeted nicely and seated promptly. I started off with the Insalata Grande which was dresses lightly but perfectly with a balsamic vinaigrette. The fresh mixed greens with baby arugula was simply topped with their amazing roasted or more like sautéed mushrooms, delicious salty olives, tomatoes, shaved parmigiana and the best chunks of juicy tender artichoke hearts. But the best part of it was the pine nuts. It gave the salad the crunch it needed.   Wife and I shared the Signature Settebello pizza. Waitress kindly described their pizza as being thin crust with chard crust and \"chewy\" dough meaning it's completely wet in the middle where you can't even pick it up even if you had skills. The pizza came out pretty quick and had lots of flavor the sausage was amazing the chard crust was something I really dig but yes the center was  soggy. There has to be a way for them to make their yummy pizza with a more cooked and not so wet center. You almost have to use a fork to eat it properly without a fork just forget about trying to pick it up.   Other then that I really did like what I had, priced fairly but I wasn't blown away to where I will come running back. Very nice Resturant and will return just not any time soon."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas! I'm from Italy and my mom is from Naples,  this Pizza perfectly represent the original Napolitan style.  Love the Bianca but get tomato sauce on it"}
{"text":"Arugula salad was basic and crisp.  Sausage pizza was excellent.  Service was prompt & accommodating to my special request to be near an outlet to recharge a GPS system."}
{"text":"The pizza was okay, more like appetizer bread.  Very disappointed that pepperoni is not available as a topping.  Would like to go back and try a main entree...Great Italian coffee!!"}
{"text":"\"peet-suh\" / \"peetsa\" / \"peedtza\" / \"pittsa\"  However you say it, this is one of the best of its kind throughout the valley!!  Situated at The District in Green Valley Ranch, this location is quite big with plenty of seating either the inside dining room or the outdoor patio that can accommodate even a fairly large group.  There's also a nice bar setup with flat screen TVs, making the restaurant a great place to watch any sporting event.  Being Napoletana, the pizza is cooked for about a minute in a wood-burning oven.  This isn't your typical NY style pizza where it can be picked up and folded in half.  Instead, the use of cutleries is advised while eating this pizza since the crust is thin and soft which doesn't hold up especially if you stock up on toppings.  Out of multiple visits, everything I've had from this place so far has been really good.  I usually like to start with Panzanella or Involtini di Prosciutto.  As far as their pizzas, I prefer the ones with crushed tomatoes: classic Margherita (mozzarella, basil, Parmigiano Regiano), the Carbonara (pancetta, egg, mozzarella) and the Settebello (pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil).  Fresh ingredients, bold flavors and great topping combinations.  I normally have the 12 inch pizza to myself which doesn't leave any room for dessert.  If you can, however, go for their dessert pizza (sliced bananas, drizzle of Nutella and dusted with powdered sugar).  Overall, Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana is definitely one of the best pizza joints in Las Vegas.  Delicious food, pleasant ambiance and excellent service.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 hungry people for our 1st visit. No direction was offered. Ordered crostini appetizer & settebello pizza. Appetizer was basically for 2. Pizza was VERY small & surprisingly extremely soggy. No Parmesan cheese or red peppers on the table or offered. Very shocked as this restaurant came highly recommended & reviewed. Left very disappointed & hungry"}
{"text":"I want to eat here every week. By far, Settebello makes my favorite wood fired pizza in Vegas. Definitely above average. They've had some great special pizzas of the week but their Margherita DOC is always the best. Besides pizza, the rest of their food is good to average- the pizza outshines the rest of the menu for me. The bar and cocktails are well above average. The wine list is good. The service is always great. Overall, one of my favorite spots in town."}
{"text":"I went here on a date Saturday around 8p.  I wasn't too impressed w/ the service or food.  I arrived a bit after my date was already seated. The waitress walked by me several times and didn't acknowledge me at all. After 20 min she came back to ask if we were ready to order, so I suggested she start w/ brining us water.  I guess she didn't like me for the rest of the night lol She was short and rude w/ us.  Basic 'hello, my name is____,' is not too much to ask for.  We ordered two different pizzas, but they looked exactly the same lol i normally would have questioned it, but I was on a 1st date so I kept my mouth shut. She never came by to ask how our food was or anything. She just dropped off the check while walking by.  The pizza was not good enough to deal w/ such bad service. Definetly not going back."}
{"text":"Probably best pizza in  green valley area!! Fresh ingredients and amazing crust/pie. Family favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"This is the pizza place to splurge on if I can get up and move to get to the place. Most of the time I am too lazy to go and opt for papa johns, but this is the real deal when it comes to great tasting pizza. It also taste better cause it's cheaper than 40$ for one pizza at grimaldis.. haha. No really, I like the pizza here better."}
{"text":"We have ordered to go two times. Their pizzas are delicious. Be sure to order their margarita and ask for extra basil. It's a little pricey, but absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"There are many pizzerias out there that claim to produce \"authentic\" Neapolitan-style pizza; however, Settebello can literally make this claim -- they are one of a select number of pizzerias that have received certification from the Vera Pizza Napoletana (VPN) for making authentic, true-to-form, Neapolitan pizza.  This is quite the designation and all the more reason to make the trek out to Henderson during your next Vegas weekend to sample the goods.     Settebello offers a selection of alcoholic beverages to go with your pizza -- red and white wines including a delicious La Crema Christi, and both a light and dark Moretti.    We ordered Margarita pizzas all around, two different kinds of salad -- both a mixed baby greens and arugula with vinaigrette -- a few glasses of wine, and a couple beers, all in all a completely satisfying meal.    I heard a rumor that they may open a second location, in which case I should start sending them letters now to consider Long Beach, California when deciding where shop number two should be located."}
{"text":"My italian friend recommended this place! I am always opened to try smth new in order to feed my son! Cute place, nice and fast service! Ordered traditional cheese pizza and meatballs! Everything was yammi, yammi. Pizza barely has a crust at all, so thin and those burnt crispy edges...mmmm! Meatballs were so soft and came with 2 slices of bread sprinkled with olive oil. Very happy with our lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  All ingredients are from Italy.  I have even been to Rome and yes the pizza tastes exactly the same.  The salads are awesome too.  Tiramisu awesome.  There has been absolutely nothing here that I have not that was delicious.  Im not even a huge fan of sausage on my pizza but here it is the best! Literally everythings good! Not a huge wine or beer list, but still a decent selection.  The only thing Settebellos has that is less than perfect is the service which isn't even bad, but never had a server really go above and beyond which is not even a complaint, just a statement, lol."}
{"text":"Actual rating: 4.5 Found this great restaurant courtesy of yelp and it was conveniently located in between the Strip and Hoover Dam(15 min), which had an amazing dam tour(pun intended). The fam and I parked in the parking lot with a Whole Foods, and when we came in, found the restaurant not very busy @2pm. Interior decor gave off a homey vibe and the brass pipes on the ceiling added a nice touch. They had (authentic?) mint candies nestled in a basket in the desk in front. So the food, which all of you are here to read about: Margarita w/ house made sausage: the margarita and house made sausage were pretty good; the sausage was ok, nothing to write home about. We also ordered the Capricciosa which was fantastic; the ham/prosciutto on the pizza was tender and so yummy! The crusts for both pizzas were slightly charred not the best part but that depends on the person. It was also really floppy from the tomato sauce which was btw super yummy Our waiter was courteous with his \"miss\" \"mister\" etc. and he was fast to get us our check. I went to the bathroom afterwords and OH MY GOD was it clean! You would expect the usual plastic stalls, fluorescent lighting, unidentifiable-liquid-on-the-floor,  but this bathroom was a cut above the rest. There was music, dim intimate lighting(to get you into a romantic pooping mood), wood accents, floral scented hand soap, paper toilet covers...it was the best $$restaurant bathroom I've ever been in... I would definitely make this into a regular stop if I lived in Las Vegas/Boulder City."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! The crust was perfectly cooked (and a little charred) on the edges and bottom while being fluffy and delicious on the inside. I went here on valentines day with my girlfriend and I was impressed. Pizzas, salad, wine and desert for two. I got the margherita pizza, somewhat of a tradition of mine at pizzerias. If they can make a simple margherita delicious then you know they are serious about pizza. Highly recommended. I would go here again! Plus the staff was very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Super awesome customer service! The manager Alexander is a legend. Amazing food and overall an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of thin crust pizza, but I think Settebello has made me a convert!  I met some friends for lunch there this weekend, and had a really great meal.  They are experienced Settebello diners, and we ordered 3 pizzas to share among us.    We arrived just after they opened, and were seated right away. The restaurant itself is lovely and airy. Service was friendly and conversational.  We ordered the settebello, the bianca, and another pizza that was not listed on the menu (I believe it is called the \"Raphael\").  All of them were delicious. The dough tasted fresh, the ingredients were delicious, and I didn't even mind that the crust was thin- it wasn't too hard and crunchy.  I am glad that Settebello is on the west side of the valley, and I'm sure I will return!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area, and have heard from multiple services this is THE place for pizza in Henderson. We were not disappointed.  My father was in F&B his whole life.  He always said, \"The best restaurants specialize in two/three dishes and that is what they do.\"  So we walk in, read the menu, and it is cocktails/beer/wine...pizza...and salads.  Taa daaa.    The ambiance is excellent, the lighting perfect and the vibe is great.  Service is very good.  We ordered a salad, drinks, wine and a salad. Nothing disappointed.  Margarita DOC was just like you would have in Napoli, Italia.  Very good, actually excellent.  The salad was wonderful, too.  Wine list is very good, by the glass, and very, very reasonable in pricing.    The only \"OK,\" and not excellent dish was dessert.  We ordered Torta de la Nona, which is one of my favorite things to order on the sweet side in Italy.  It was good, but not excellent.  It just wasn't \"lemony\" enough.  But the Lavazza espresso was excellent.  Again, great menu, great food, excellent flavors and wonderful service.    I'll be back -- again, and again.  UPDATE:  We were there again this weekend. Fabulous, again. Love this place."}
{"text":"We have loved Settebello for several years, since we lived in Utah. We were pleasantly surprised to learn there were locations here in Vegas and they're actually better! We dine here a few times a month and they are very consistently fantastic. Our go-to is the Diavola. A must-try if you like heat. I'm also a big fan of the bianca, which is fresh and light. Both beet salads are lovely."}
{"text":"Thanks to the reviewers at Yelp, I found this place on a recent trip to Vegas. Why do places like Papa John's (how do they even call that junk pizza?) and Pizza Hut exist when there are places like this around? Because we live in 'Merica, that's why. Places such as those I just mentioned have their place, such as squashing an intense munchie session or mopping up spills at the supermarket. However, when you want top-notch ingredients and awesome flavor, this is the place.  It may not be $5 for a pizza (I think it was $13 for the one I ordered) but it was more than sufficient and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Decor is pretty nice, all of the flavors are there. Although, I got about 2 cloves of sliced garlic on one piece of pizza (about 13 slices) most of the garlic was all in one place. Overall they need to work on quality and quantity control of the food that they produce. They must also work on the art that is pizza."}
{"text":"Second time for me. Overall great experience, quality place! Prices seem reasonable. Seated almost immediately. Fairly busy for a Friday...and that means the food is good. Our server Whitnee was very pleasant. Also she was very happy to help with recommendations and made sure everything tasted good. We started with the Insalata Grande. Very fresh ingredients, you know immediately when you taste it. Very light in dressing, which kept it light and balanced; you can taste the raw ingredients. We got three pizzas. All were very good. I had the Diavola, good I'm taste and quality. I was warned of the spicy meat on it and it was spicy! But it was pretty good. Only bad thing of my experience was I had to ask to have another water after completely drinking mine. Tiramisu for dessert, very well done. I shall return!"}
{"text":"Searching Yelp for a pizza place close by my house I read the reviews for Settebello and decided to make a Whole Foods and Lunch outing. I'm so glad that I did. I can't believe I never really noticed this place since I shop at this Whole Foods a good bit, but it's fairly inconspicuous.   When it comes to pizza I try to be pretty open minded. I worked for a pizza trade magazine for over a year. In that year I had tried more pizza than any one person should probably eat. I have a hard time saying anything is \"the best\" since I try to appreciate each style for it's own merit. Saying that, it actually means a lot of me to give a pizza place a 5 star. This has to be some of the BEST pizza I've had in YEARS.   What to expect? VERY thin crust pizza with very fresh ingredients. The menu isn't huge. I've had a few pizzas now and even tried their proscuitto/goat cheese salad [can't remember the name]. Be aware though that since the pizza is so thin even I can eat an entire one by myself and I don't eat that much. I have definitely enjoyed several afternoons of pizza and bourbon before I went shopping. I probably should reverse that order though since I wind up drinking too much bourbon and buying random junk at Whole Foods.   On a side note I would watch the \"bartenders\" is you drink anything besides wine or beer. I drink my bourbon on the rocks. The last time I went the bartender neither knew what Maker's was (it's the best they have) and he was about to shake my bourbon in a shaker before I stopped him. I find it a little comical now but was a little taken aback then.   I definitely think this is the best pizza in Las Vegas and some of the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed the second time I visited. Not sure whether it's because we got some of the \"cheaper\" options (the Monday $5 Margarita pizza) and the happy hour pizza...the pizzas left much to be desired. We got the mini sausage pizza on the happy hour menu. They didn't do a good job at all of spreading the cheese evenly on the pizza -- in fact, one slice didn't have any cheese at all!? There was only one piece of basil. The margarita pizza was just as pitiful...the cheese was really only on half the pizza, only one piece of basil (basil is kind of a key part of a margarita pizza!?), and worst of all the bottom of the pizza was completely soggy. The pizza -- I mean dough with tomato sauce (and maybe a tiny piece of cheese) -- was pretty much falling apart as I was eating it. We also got drinks. I thought that their mule was fine, but my friend ordered the Old Fashioned and felt like they kind of skimped on that drink. More than half of the drink was a giant ice cube.  The one redeeming thing is that their sausage is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"I love Settebello! Napoli style pizza rocks my socks off! Get the Diavola pizza if you like spicy! Mmmm"}
{"text":"the pizza was literally soggy af.  the crust was limp and flappy.  it was like i was eating pizza soup.  i could never return and be okay."}
{"text":"I like coming to this place but I forget... the food is good but the service is crappie. :-/ Tyler is awesome!"}
{"text":"Did you know that a former USC QB opened this place up?  I'm so glad that this restaurant exists. When I went to Naples, it was so ghetto that I was not comfortable enough to venture out to their pizza spots. Only if I knew it'd taste amazing, I would have been more ballsy! I really like making my own pizza (red sauce, onions, mushrooms, sausage) or ordering the Pizza Lasagna. The house salad is good but the Insalata Grande is not worth the $8 (trully boring). Both tiramisu and lemon tart were good desserts; the textures and flavors were on the dot but nothing unique (except for the price $5!). I think I'm officially a fatty because I don't get full when I share my pizza. I think I could eat one whole pizza on my own. I'm pretty sure actually.  We've dined in once before but usually we do take-out. Of course our dining in experience was so much better because the pizza was fresher but we like ordering take out from here when we have our friends over or want to stay in. Such a great place!"}
{"text":"Overall:  Good quality pizzas, especially if you're looking for authentic Italian (not NY) pizza.  Pizza dough is cooked well and tastes good, and the sauce, although light, is full of flavor.  Because of a good pizza foundation, any toppings would be a fine complement to the pizza.  If you're expecting a heavy pizza like Pizza Hut, don't go here.  Go to Metro Pizza or Grimaldi's.  Setting: Early Dinner w/ brother on Saturday, 05/28/2011  Thumbs Up: Misto appetizer (Italian meat sampler), Margherita con (pick your toppings - we got artichoke hearts and roasted mushrooms), Capricciosa pizza (if you've never had prosciutto on your pizza, you're missing out)."}
{"text":"My large group enjoyed our time at happy hour here last night.  Really good food (the mini pizzas are large enough for a full meal and are only $5 during happy hour!) and drinks make happy guests.  The interior is what I would call \"rustic chic,\" with dark wood everywhere.    Since the place just opened, service was not perfect (a few orders were misplaced and incorrect drinks were served) but the servers themselves were really nice and quick to correct any oversights.  I can see this place becoming a regular venue in my happy hour rotation!  Yay for another great place on the west side!"}
{"text":"Settebello's makes the best pizza I have ever had. No questions asked.  The margerita is very very good, and you will certainly not be disappointed. I would give it a 4 star.  The Pizza Carbonara is fantastic. The egg on the pizza is awesome, and I would give this pizza a 4.5. My only problem is that the pancetta can be a bit salty and sometimes overpower the pizza.  Finally, the Settebello pizza. It was actually the last one I tried because I am not generally a fan of sausages. Yet theses sausages were nothing like the overpowering sausages that overpower most pizzas. This was pure, fresh, sausage perfection, and this pizza was absolutely legendary. A 5 star pizza, the best pie I've ever had.  NOTE- Unless you are absolutely starving, I am not sure you can eat a pizza and get dessert. I have tried and failed twice, so maybe split a pizza then go for the epic-sounding desserts."}
{"text":"Not a bad pizza place for the price. The ambiance is nice there, the pizza was pretty good too.   I give the pizza 4 stars, just because I prefer a thicker crust and less cheese than there was on it.   Review is 3 stars because of the service. The beer I ordered was room temperature, and nothing can ruin a meal like a warm beer. The wrong pizza was brought out, but was quickly remade, and our water was refilled once in an hour even though my cup was empty for a long time.   I might come back, but it's not a place I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here yesterday and it was so delicious! We had the involtini, the Emilia, and a bolognese pizza that I can't remember the name of. The Emilia was one of the best white pizzas I've had in Vegas. All the flavors were so unique and the ingredients tasted super fresh. I've been wanting to come to the actual restaurant for a long time after having it to go with others. I'm really glad I finally went and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was my very first time trying this style of pizza.  What I liked about it was that it was simple, light, and not greasy like some pizzas can be. The cheese on the pizza was superb, and the chewiness of it went perfectly well with the rather flat, thin dough. That was the part I didn't like too much about my pizza; the pizza dough was very bland and tasted a bit like what I would imagine what hardtack would taste like.  I suppose it contributes to the simplicity and lightness of the pizza; nevertheless, it lacked flavour, save for the burnt black bits at the edge. I'm glad the cheese and the toppings were good enough that this didn't bother me too much.  I would've given this restaurant three stars if I hadn't ordered dessert.  The dessert menu had many appealing choices, but I had no trouble settling on the Affogato (I am an espresso enthusiast.) I chose chocolate gelato to go with the espresso.  The gelato was creamy and smooth, just as I would expect out of anything labelled \"gelato.\"  It was a delicious dessert for a mocha-lover like me.  The tiramisu was also good; the best part about it was that it wasn't too sweet, which seems to be a common flaw in many tiramisus.   The service was just fine; everyone was attentive and fast, and I had a good experience here."}
{"text":"My fourth or fifth time here and always impressed. For a pizza joint that is right in the heart of Green Valley and reasonably priced...I would definitely come back! There are so many pizza places to choose from, but if you want something light, fresh, but yet still satisfies your appetite, come here. Pizzas and salads are so tastey and freakin fresh! Wine list could use a bit of a selection, among the dessert list. Wished we got the Nutella pizza instead of deciding to burn some calories by walking over to whole foods for their nasty Mochi ice cream. Yuck! Next time we will definitely trust our gut and stick around for dessert. Service was very friendly and super fast. Got a table right away on a Saturday night! We just got lucky with timing I guess."}
{"text":"I love the innovative bar program. And the broccili rabe crostini."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The pizza is phenom! The wait staff is super nice and the drink list looks like it has a lot of potential -- I haven't tried it yet -- this is my go to Neopolitan style pizzeria! The certification is on the wall! Can't get more authentic Italian than that!"}
{"text":"There are many very good 4-star pizza places in town with comparably good 4-star pizzas. What really puts this place at the top for me is the top-notch service and the fact that you can replace the regular mozzarella in any of the pizzas on their menu with BUFFALO mozzarella. This was a fabulous surprise for me because I am lactose intolerant and have been missing out on pizza for awhile now. So hooray for Settebello!"}
{"text":"How strange it is to give a restaurant four stars... but plan to never return there again.  As I said in another review, I've never been to Italy, but Settebello's concoctions make it easy to pretend otherwise. Even the flour for their dough comes from Naples!  I ordered the margherita with roasted mushrooms and pine nuts, mindful of the advice on the menu not to get more than two toppings. At this point I realized that the pizzas here were probably of the \"pick up a piece and watch the whole slice point south\" variety, something I've been trying to get away from since moving to Las Vegas, but - shrug - the restaurant was serene and I like trying new things.  Service was friendly and very fast, the kind where your drink is refilled before it's finished (unless you're my husband, who quaffs his lemonade like a Viking fresh from the pillage), although we were the only ones there for most of the meal, having arrived when it opened. (After shopping, when we walked past again, business seemed much busier.)  When our pizzas arrived, my eyes lit up at the outer crust - mmm, pillowy! The basil leaves were brown around the edges, but the ingredients were so flavourful and fresh that I have to assume it's one of those \"professionally wilted\" situations that I'm too uncouth to know about.   Sure enough, the pizza was dangly/drippy if you picked it up, but the components were so good that I didn't mind turning to knife and fork for this one. As my husband more or less said in his review, not every pizza is meant to be suitable for eating while on the sofa.  Unfortunately, I have an aversion to anything that tastes burned, even if it's done deliberately. I ended up leaving much of that beautiful outer crust on the plate because the sooty smears underneath weren't to my taste. Others may enjoy this \"charred\" aspect, though.  When I looked over at my husband's pizza, I noticed that his was a little less soggy than mine. Dang. Mine may as well not have had a crust once you got two-and-a-half inches (I just mentally measured) from the outside rim. This was really regrettable, since crust is very important to me when I eat pizza.   There are only so many mouthfuls of cheese, bit of sauce, and perhaps a pine nut or mushroom that a person can eat. I'd requested my pizza sliced, and the first slice was a true treat. The individual ingredients had a flavour that fills the whole mouth. The second slice was nice. The third slice had me glancing at the dessert menu, eager for variety. (That \"torta della nonna\" with the lemon cream over pastry with almonds sounds divine.)   I didn't get dessert, though, because no way did I want to take this wet mess - however expertly made - home, so I soldiered on, using up my hunger on that third piece. The final slice I tried to pick at, but while I'm frugal, I'm not a trash can. I gave up. But hey, you can't fault a restaurant for being too generous with their \"individual\" portion sizes.  Upon reflection, for me Settebello is a case of the pizza not being greater than the sum of its parts. The cheese was salty and savoury, the mushrooms earthy, the pine nuts soft and woody, and the sauce rustic and not sweet.... but without enough crust to pull these tastes together, the dish failed for me.   However, the experience was worth it, and anyone who likes Italian-style pizza that follows the VPN (Vera Pizza Napoletana) guidelines will no doubt be popping by Settebello whenever time and wallet permit."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing, especially the Nutella pizza! The pizza is different than American so you have to expect that it's crispier toward the edges and softer toward the inner core. The Diavola was great! I loved the spicy salami that was on it and all that cheese! Mmmmm :) I loved the rucola salad and added shaved Parmesan to it which completed it.   The atmosphere was great and service was good."}
{"text":"Ok, i HAD to up the rating to a 5!   Reason:  We keep coming back and this place just doesn't disappoint!!   The Insalata Grande salad and pizza are the best we've ever had!!! I added a few pics from our most recent visit!   Try this place, you'll be hooked too!!! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Went again today for a late lunch early dinner (5:00pm) with the husband and this time brought a friend...   This place is consistently good!!   Great pizza and salad and great service!!!! There were about 3 girls walking around all the time, if you made eye contact one of them was there to see if there was anything you needed! Our friend ordered the Pizza Lasagna and didnt read the menu good and didnt know it came with ricotta cheese (he doesnt like ricotta) and when he said \"oh, i didnt know it had ricotta\"  they could tell he wasnt happy and they offered 2 times to take it back and make him a new pizza. He ended up keeping it and just picking it off.. but i thought it was very nice of them to offer, even though it was his fault for not reading not theirs.   Keep up the good work Settebello's!!"}
{"text":"We initially had a bit of confusion during seating due to their happy hour policies. After a few moments of irritation, we were able to secure the same price for our beverages while seated in a booth (they normally require you sit at the bar, but one of our party was under age).   Our waiter recommended that we try their insolata appetizer, which was prosciutto wrapped around arugula with goat & other cheeses, olive oil and balsamic reduction. It was a delicious, light start.   We ordered two pizzas; the cappricioso (spelling?) and the special of the week, which was a white pizza with cannelini beans sauteed with salami. Both were satisfying and flavorful on a super-thin crust. My boyfriend found the special pizza to be rather bland and didn't finish his piece, neither did our friend. The other pizza had big hunks of kalamata olives that provided a strong briny flavor that complimented the pizza well. It also looked like they use a real wood-fire oven to cook their pizzas.   Their tiramisu was creamy with a good balance between sweet, bitter espresso and creamy cheeses. The lady finger bunny ears on top were a cute touch but they weren't very crisp.   I had sampled some of my boyfriend's left over slices the day before and declared the pizza to be crave worthy which was one of the primary reasons we ventured here. One of his friends had proclaimed it the best pizza in Vegas, which I doubt. It's tasty, yes, but a true pizza master could craft better. If we're back on this side of town we'll probably come back given my boyfriend's insatiable love of pizza. We'll  be sure to try lots of other places, though, before we can call this the absolute best."}
{"text":"Wow, I have never been served so much carbon in my life! It is hard enough trying to get my kids to eat \"traditional\" pizza due to issues related to greasy cheese, runny sauce, etc. Mind you, I have spent some time in Italy (Florence, Milan) and am ready for a more traditional pie. However, the pizza we were served was inedible. The top was charred as if recently rescued from a burning building. The cooks must not clean their oven after each order, because the bottom of my pie was also burned with little bits of burned who-knows-what embedded into the crust. Let's talk sauce for a minute. A good pizza sauce will thicken while cooking (especially when burned to a blackened Frisbee). Amazingly, the sauce was so watery that it still ran in rivulets over each slice, thereby making each bite a soggy, carbony, yuck fest."}
{"text":"The fondest memories I have studying in Italy: drinking espresso at Bar Rosso in Campo Santa Margherita, and smoking cheap cigarettes with friends all day long, and eating a ton of food.... I literally stuffed my face with so much Italian (food) that I should have come back 300lbs heavier, which since walking was the main transportation method in Venice, I managed to lose weight (best fricking deal ever)!!! It was, to say, a most wonderful experience....  Since then, I've quit smoking (lozenges are the way to go), but still guzzle down the caffeine...And having Pizza in Italy was another out- of-this-world experience; having an individual-size, thinly crusted pizza, eating with a knife and fork with the freshest ingredients,  you couldn't ask for anything more satisfying than even the simplest of them all: the Margherita.  With just three ingredients-Basil, Tomato Sauce and Mozzarella, it is the purist and most difficult of flavorful pizzas to achieve. Click below to read more...  And Settebello brings me back to those fond memories, it captures the essence of Italian cooking with fresh and raw ingredients to create their Pizzas.  They are licensed by the VPN (Vera Pizza Napoletana) an organization created in the 80's to preserve, promote and educate the traditional art of Napolitan Pizza making. The VPN Charter provides strict guidelines and requirements to protect the integrity of this culinary discipline, which is why Settebello's pizza catapults me back to Italy and it's wonderful, rich style of humble yet elegant cuisine.  Primarily a pizza restaurant, Settebello does provide some appetizers which is comprised mostly of breads, salads and cured meats.  All of these are absolutely delicious and I recommend ordering one in each category if you're hungry.  Our personal favorite is the Involtini di Prosciutto: Prosciutto wrapped around Arugula and Goat Cheese with shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction and ExtraVirgin Olive Oil on top.  This is an incredibly satisfying and evolved dish, it combines a salad quotient with a cured meat app that is developed and sophisticated: the peppery bitter greens with the creaminess of goat cheese and the buttery Prosciutto Crudo is just symphonic, add the sweet/tart Balsamic and fruity Olive Oil and it sends me over the top........  Moving on: we have two Pizzas that are our favorite, (and pretty much the only two worth getting): the Settebello and the Diavola.  Due to our new harm reduction policies, we can only order one pizza to split, but still order a dessert.  May not be conducive to food blogging, but it is what it is, (look to future posts for updates on other dishes).  The utmost favorite is the Settebello: with Fennel Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozarella, Basil and Crushed Tomatoes with a drizzle of Olive Oil, this is the supreme Pizza of the Napolitan set...  We thoroughly enjoy eating this pizza, with all the topping working so well with each other, (sometimes I like to add some Pepperoncino and a little more Olive Oil to enhance the flavor) and it's balanced well with the toppings to crust/bread ratio, so you get your carb cravings sated simultaneously...  At last, for dessert, there's quite a selection at Settebello, but our two favorites are: the house made Cannoli and Tiramisu. This time, we ordered the Tiramisu, a creamy and decadent dessert with Marscapone Cream, Lady Fingers soaked in Espresso and Disaronno and powdered chocolate on top.  The serving size, in my mind, too small (a cake pan is more my size)!  It's a great dessert, totally authentic and hits the spot after a great meal.  Settebello is the best Pizza Place in Las Vegas, definitely a must if you enjoy an elevated dining experience with good authentic Italian food!

{"text":"Service usually sucks. I don't understand how a little place like this can run without any discernible management or the owner's presence. It shows, as the waitstaff is almost completely untrained. We've been there three times and have yet to see anyone who looks like they're doing more than cooking, waiting, or hosting.  I hate the layout. It can't be feng shui, I know that. Having all the tables pushed to one wall, the open kitchen off to the other, separated by a no-mans-land about 20 feet wide presumably for waitstaff and customers trying to get to the bathroom, and the long counter off the kitchen with a single stool (who is that for? was there supposed to be counter seating?) really doesn't feel right.  That said, the food is really great. Enough to far outweigh all the negatives. Like, I can't believe this kind of pizza can be found in this town. Every other piece of pizza I've had in Vegas has totally sucked, and here's this little place that just totally nails it with traditionally made, wood fired hearth cooked pizzas. 3 and just under 1/2."}
{"text":"First time I've ever been disappointed. I gave four stars because the pizza as usual was amazing, and the Nutella desert pizza is always the best ending. The service tonight was HORRID though. I met my family there after I got off work. I sat down with them on the patio, and waited ten minutes before I even saw anyone come over. Our waitress was serving the bar and the patio, but both were dead. I watched her cleaning the bar the entire time I waited. Three people including our server came outside, and I was never once asked what I wanted to drink. She then came over to the table to set down our plates for dessert, said \"oh, we added one more\" and never came back. I still didn't have a drink, and had to ask the host when he came over with the dessert. We also had to ask him for refills because she never came back to the table. Needless to say, I was less than thrilled. I will be making sure to stay out of her section from now on."}
{"text":"I came here for LJ (UYE) with bunch of other yelpers. Literally took up two big tables eight. They did great job of taking everyones order and really for the most part getting everyone orders right. When it comes too big parties its usually more hassle but the staff there really on point. I know never saw anyone on our table with empty glass of soda or what not. Before I even had chance too finish had a server come up ask me if need another drink. Yelpers do we literally was the last ones too shut the place down but the staff never pushed us out. Yet again another start for service and just handling big party.   I have been here once before but it been while so looking forward too the pizza and the company. The thing about this style is traditional not suppose too cut the pizza (although if you want they WILL cut it up for you). It can make for interesting eating not only using fork and knife action. Also the fact that its thin crust pizza and depending on the pizza order can be even more tricky. Think of it as part of the fun! I order the Stellebello. I enjoyed. I like the combination of pine nuts, sausage, sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. The crust was good. The pizza cooked in cold brick oven so its not your traditional crust crispy but more on the soft side. So if thinking getting crusty crust you will be disappointed. It decent size pie so warning lay off the bread. Lol! Or else going have hard time finishing off the pie.  I am fan of Stellebello! Just that since its in Henderson would much rather go with my favorite closer too home. Sure if in the area someplace would stop by get my pie on.   Mahalos too LJ for setting up the UYE. As always great time meeting new yelpers never meet before and seeing friends again. Till the next UYE."}
{"text":"Always been fan of Settebello ever since I went too there first location in the District. So hearing about opening second location on the other end of town. Excited about not having to drive all the way too Henderson get me some Settebello. It just open this past week sometime so had my reservations opening week. They might still be working out kinks but honest everything went really smooth from service and the food still amazing!   I had the pizza carbonara. One of my favorite pizza on the menu. Still taste amazing as always.The fried egg topping that think adds so much depth too any pizza. You get some of that good old fashion fried bacon and eggs he perfect compliment. Breakfast on pizza! NOm.NOM. I had dinner with brother family got too try few appetizers besides pizza. We had Arancini balls and was awesome! It first time every ordered them. I love outside perfect crispy golden brown, risotto was cooked perfect and creamy, and sits on tomato sauce that was nice refreshing light. You combine all the elements together really really good. Also had the MIsto and focaccia. The Misto presentation on long rectangle cutting board is art looking at it. Not sure which meat too eat first too the cheeses and decided hit the olive/artichoke next. The focaccia was great. It not your fluffy one that looks more like bread bread but much more thin and just has nice flavor. It perfect appetizer too compliment Misto.   The service was definitely five star from the minute walked in everyone was friendly, waitress asked if we been here before (we like yup! so never had too go over the different style of pizza then most people think normal crusty crust) and if had any questions with the menu, and never had too worry about empty glass of soda. Well done.  The only difference is TOTALLY different set up then the original one. Here the open kitchen is much more open kitchen one that as soon step foot in the restaurant can see. They have cool top end slicer that can see the cooks slicing all the meats for the menu. It lot lower ceiling, have little almost private dining area (not sure if could rent it out) more wine cellar that had few tables in it, the bar area interesting they had glass panel kind of separate the two areas but really connected, darker in general inside, and feels more upscale vibe then the first one. I am sure the sign out front not the permanent one since just open only banner. I feel like this one holds more people then the original one.   Happy that have one on my side of town. Look forward too making more visit in the future."}
{"text":"I went here for fathers day... so please consider that ... it was busy. My favorite is the Misto but that night they ran out of the artichoke and my daughter's pizza order they made a mistake. The food is good and I feel fair to give it a 3 star. I think if everything was up to par and it was not fathers day ... I would recommend 4 Stars. I would recommend Misto to everyone."}
{"text":"WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?? WHERE ARE YOUR TASTE BUDS??WHY IS THIS PLACE GETTING GOOD RATINGS??  this food is garbage easily the worst pizza my wife and i have ever had, i had to instantly order a soda to get this terrible \"pizza\" taste out of my mouth.. i won't bother with the salads 1 missing dressing the other missing 2 ingredents just paid the check left a nice tip and swore to never come back again and warn others of such false ads"}
{"text":"On this visit I once again had the quattro formaggi - topped with tomatoes, fontina, gorgonzola, mozzarella, and parmigiana reggiano cheeses, strips of fresh basil and evoo.  The gorgonzola cheese was really overpowering - I think some accidentally slipped through the chef's fingers because it's never tasted this strong. For this reason (and the tiramisu, which I'll get to later) I gave it 4 starts, which is killing me as I love this place.  The restaurant was packed (on a Thursday night) so we opted to eat at the bar. I would definitely eat there again as the counter area was huge!  We decided to try dessert for the first time. My husband has never met a  tiramisu he didn't fall in love with, but this one was just ok. I tasted it and was really disappointed, but we come here for the best pizza on earth so we can live with the fact that their tiramisu sucks!  There was something called the Dream Bomba calling my name, so I forced myself to order it: chocolate covered peanut butter gelato with caramel and chocolate drizzled over the top. OMG it was fabulous - da bomba!"}
{"text":"This pizza must be made with magic.    We were visiting Las Vegas from California and staying at a hotel on Las Vegas Boulevard.  Based on the reviews on Yelp we decided the 20 minute drive to Settebello  would be worth it.  The pizza here is the best I have ever eaten.  The crust has a similar texture and taste of the Indian bread naan.  Does anyone not like that bread?  The sauce and cheese were perfect.  When eating it I thought I died and went to heaven.  One pizza is just the right size for one person.  Every time we visit Las Vegas and want pizza this is the restaurant we will go to."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! The pizza is probably the most authentic Italian pizza you can find in Vegas/Henderson. The prices are extremely reasonable and they even have specials + happy hour!  Never had a bad experience so far with the service and always can't wait for my next visit to get my fix of their amazing menu!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was good. I've been to their Green Valley location twice before in the past and while I did enjoy my food at the Fort Apache location, it wasn't nearly as good as the original location. I'm not saying that it was bad but I didn't get that same \"WOW\" feeling that I got when I ate at the Green Valley location and I rather not pay that much for pizza unless it was as good as I had before."}
{"text":"Been to the one in Green Valley. It was better. We got the Quatro Fromagi. Crust was soggy and impossible to eat without a knife and fork.  I like Motley Crue but as the musical choice for a gourmet pizza place, uh try again.  Decor is dark and uninviting. Find a new interior designer. Looks like the old Posh Burger which went belly up in 4 months.   Not sure how the Health Department passed the wood tables. Not enough sealant on the surface to keep out the last patron's food, crumbs and bits of the cloth used to wipe down the tabletop.  On the plus side, the involtini was good.  Not compelling enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Note, this pizza is real Neapolitan style pizza. So you are getting a pizza that is not loaded with a ton of ingredients, rather fewer toppings and more simple, traditional, sauce and dough.   The service is fast, food always good, and staff very friendly. The pizzas are cooking in a wood fire oven that gets over 900 degrees F. Takes approximately one minute to cook giving the pizza's a thin crispy on the outside chewy on the inside crust. Most of the ingredients are imported from Italy, and the cook moved from Italy to help the owner start the location, which was originally of horizon and valley view.   If you like your pizzas with so much cheese and the sauce loaded with so many seasonings that it doesn't even taste like tomatoes then this is not the place for you. If you like authentic simple recipes and high quality ingredients, for an all in all reasonable price, then you will enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"Lived in Vegas almost 9 years and this is by far my favorite pizza place. If you have ever been to Italy, this is authentic Napolitano pizza. Everything is fantastic! Including every dessert on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been staying at the Green Valley Ranch for a business conference this week. I decided to explore \"The District\" a little and my coworker and I landed on Settebello. Absolutely worth the hype.   We started with a couple glasses of red wine and the Involtini appetizer (arugula and goat cheese wrapped in proscuitto crudo)... amazing. It was every bit as good as it sounds. Delicious and fresh and the perfect portion size for us.  After inquiring with our server on his favorite pizzas, we landed on the Diavola and the special for the evening which was a Bacon Jam Pizza. Both were absolutely incredible... I couldn't even pick a favorite. The Diavola was spicy and had the traditional red sauce which the Bacon Jam was the perfect mix of salty and sweet, with goat cheese and a white sauce base.   I saved room for some *peanut butter gelato* that was decadent and rich... an excellent pair for my red wine.   I have no complaints! I loved the ambiance and the service (the servers were all very good looking... not that that matters ;).   Next time I'm in Henderson, Settebello is my first stop!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  The whole meal was excellent...one of those where you leave feeling full, and yet you don't feel heavy or gross because you loaded up on nasty, cheap crap.  The pizzas were excellent, filled with flavor and excellent toppings.  The crust was chewy and perfect.  We had a misto platter of assorted meats and cheese, which was excellent, as well as a very good caprese salad.  To finish it off, we had delicious panna cotta, which had a great flavor and texture.  Overall a superb meal.  Only real downsides were the soda was kind of flat on the first glass I had, and when they brought the second one, it was worse, so I sent the second one back without drinking it and asked for water.  When the bill came they did not take it off, which I thought was kind of cheap...I mean, I drank half a glass of weak coke and you don't just take it off when I tell you it was not very good and was getting worse?  Whatever.  Also, the service was slow...I mean the food took quite a while to come out, and the server, while not rude or anything, was far from being friendly.  She just seemed like she was doing the motions, trying to seem pleasant...if that makes sense.  Overall, a great meal though."}
{"text":"Decided to do takeout tonight. Got a settebello pizza for about $16. Pizza was thin crust and flavorful. Good mix of ingredients. So glad it's just around the corner from us."}
{"text":"Review for new location on Sahara and Fort Apache:  Loved the traditional Napoli pizza; it was on point! If people are complaining, they are not used to the real thing and need a trip to Italy to explore another part of the world. This restaurant is certified as well.   The ambiance was lovely, modern with a warm, comfortable twist. Though the layout is quite open, it was still quiet enough to hear the person seated across from you. This restaurant could easily accommodate a group of 8 -10 for lunch/dinner. My friend dined here for a late lunch the week before, and he said their Happy Hour prices and specials were surprisingly decent. I will give it a try in the next few weeks.   The server was amazing - attentive, knowledgeable,  friendly, and inviting. As many of us know, great servers are a rare breed now-a-days in LV as most act like they are doing their guests a favor in the land of Make a Living Off Your Tips. This was also nice to find at a new, trendy, hotspot in Vegas. (Server was Josh - he remembered my guy friend's name and is unfortunately going to the Henderson location permanently).   The timing of the food was perfect, the quality was great, and the price was reasonable. Everything I tasted was delicious - not too much, not bland, and authentic."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path if you're on the strip but this luckily wasn't too far from my parents' house. Stuck in a small but tasteful strip mall, in a space that reminds me more of a brew pub than a place that serves staunchly authentic Napoletan pizza (most of the ingredients are even imported from Italy).  Maybe I was expecting the red checkered table cloths...  Service was friendly and fast. Inexplicably, my wine was brought in a small regular water glass, while I saw someone at another table get what looked like a wine glass to pour her sparkling water into.   I had the Quattro Stagioni, which was a Margherita divided into 4 quarters: one with wood oven roasted sausage, one with salame, one with roasted mushrooms and one with calamata olives.   The first thing I noticed was how good the crust was. Super thin with small patches of  black from the oven. The toppings were not generous but that could just be the Napoletan methodology. The cheese was in small dollops rather than spread all over. I found the pizza to be  on the salty side, perhaps because they use sea salt. The olives were whole pitted olives which fell off as I ate the pizza.   The pizza overall was excellent and I managed to ram the entire 12\" pizza down my throat in a record 15 minutes.  I brought my 5 star rubber stamp but couldn't quite pull the trigger on it. I really enjoyed it but it did not blow me out of the water. I definitely want to come again and try some more next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"we've made it a point to try the 5 star reviewed restaurants around.  this place definitely didn't disappoint!  what sold it for me was the crust/dough.  delicious!!  amazing pizza. definitely worth a try.  i got the diavalo and it was awesome.  we also got the insalato and that was tasty."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian pizza, the pizza here gives you a product that closely resembles the real thing. Sometimes the pizza is very watery and other times it's right on. I used to live in Italy and I do not remember the basil on the pizza ever being burnt to a crisp, which creates a bad taste. I believe in Italy, they put the basil on after the pizza comes out of the oven.  Wish this place would focus on creating a better basic Italian napoletano  style pizza which is a high art form when executed correctly."}
{"text":"Good pizza, perfect dough not too thick not too thin. Sauce on the pizza is fresh not acidic. The salads are good too, I had the Involtini with prosciutto and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Always order the special. The flavors have always been harmonious. The coolest special I ever had included thin lemon slices cooked in and I always think about that pizza. Another time I had a special drizzled in truffle oil, so great. The service has gotten better the few times I've been back. This is a great place to bring non-adventurous eaters because they think it's just pizza. Little do they know they are actually eating something cool, thin crust, no slices, individual pizzas with real flavor. Settebello is not an everyday pizza joint. Come here for semi-casual occasion like taking your parents on a lunch date."}
{"text":"Don't really care for Vegas, but Henderson seemed really nice and almost sane and also featured grass on some of the boulevards. I wanted to spend more time there.  This Settebello is seemingly identical to the one one in SLC in terms of menu, which is good. Maybe a bit more or less formal? Can't really decide.   Regardless, really mega good Napo pizza. The Caprese appetizer was massively  delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had.  Such fresh ingredients and high end drinks too.  I luv luv coming here and bringing all my friend who visit. They are always amazed at the beautiful decor and wonderful pizza.  Great service.  So happpy to have this gem in Vegas.  Thank u so much for being kind and open for us locals.  Five stars !!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how horrible of service and food we had here.  WoW  I don't know who's doing the reviews but it seams like they are inside jobs..  lol  Really.... Horrible service and food..!!"}
{"text":"I'm no New Yorker, but this is the best pizza place I've ever been to. It's the only thing I miss about living in Vegas!   The Emilia pizza melts in your mouth. There's cream, there's prosciutto, the texture is perfect...what more do you need in a pizza?   The pizzas are really thin, so one person can generally polish off a whole one. YUM!"}
{"text":"You will dismiss the lack of ambiance when you wrap your lips around a slice of one of Settebello's pizza's..  Fresh ingredients, baked in their wood burning oven Settebello is by far one of the city's tastiest pizza restaurants to date.  The restaurant itself isn't very sexy but who needs sexy and ambiance when you have deliciousness such as their gourmet pizzas?  If you haven't been, you should make an effort to stop by, your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"proabbly the best ive found so far in Vegas. awesome!  lil crowded/tight fit in the bar area..."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent Settebello because of it's close proximity to our office and the exceptional food/service we've received in the past. However,  today was not one of those days. We arrived begore the typical lunch rush at noon and were seated. The new waitres was obviously frazzled already. We oredered our usual lunch special - two pizzas and two salads for $22. The new girl then informed us we could not order what we wanted, even after we assured her that we would pay the difference for the additional toppings like we have everytime in the past. She got offended and told us the other girl (the usual waitress that has served us for the last year or so) was fired and that ot was because of people like us modifying our order. We decided to stay and order the special and the side salads since we had already been served our drinks. Our salads finally came,  but by this time several other people had shown up for lunch. She must have been the only person hosting and waiting tables as it was pretty hard to get her attention. Our pizza came out of the oven and sat on the counter for several mintues before she came out of the back and finally cut it and brought it to our table. Sadly it was now cold, but had the promise of being a pretty tasty pizza. When we asked to settle up for the salad and drinks, and told her our pizza was cold she proceeded to walk over to the manager and tell him we didn't like the pizza and so the very nice man came over and gave us a free pizza coupon for our next visit. (But to be clear, no we actually thought the flavor was good, but eating a cold pizza was not to be desired and trying to flag down this waitress was very difficult). All in all kudos to the manager, he obviously cares about his customers, especially ones that come almost once  a week. I guess the other girl who used to work there was fired for being nice and accommodating to her customer, who knows,  I can only go by what the new waitress told us (who even says stuff like that to customers? ) but I can tell you that the service was terrible"}
{"text":"As a former brooklyn ny resident, I'm beyond snob when it comes to pizza. I've been here over a year and wouldn't even condescend to try Las Vegas pizza until yesterday. Heaven. Like seriously. This is my second day IN A ROW at settebello. Shut up...I'll work it off."}
{"text":"I know this review has been months in the making but most of it was written out and I just forgot to complete it.  Settebello deserves the full 5 star rating from me first because of their excellent customer service.  I setup a reservation for a group dinner for 15 people, it was officially a UYE but I'm sure they had no idea it was a herd of Yelpers coming who would most likely analyze everything about the experience and rip them for anything bad in a review, unless someone had spilled the beans.  Anyways they knew to bring their A game that night.  Everything from the first phone conversation with one of the managers, to us showing up at the reservation time and having them already ready, to almost completely accommodating our large party, which was set for 15 then grew to 20+ on an already busy night, to getting all our orders, drinks, and checks, and to not kicking us out after when we were just hanging out and talking story was perfect for me wanting to go back ASAP. Shall we try for 30 people next time!? They're an excellent place for large group dining.  They also deserve the 5 star rating because of the good. I already knew I was going to enjoy the delicious pizza creations coming out from their wood burning brick ovens being featured on one my favorite food tv shows Unique Eats. Do you know how many times I've seen the same clip of Settebello' s on my giant screen HD TV before I gave in? A bunch of times and many times I was hungry and drooling over the what I saw. I had the Settebello Pizza, why not, they put their name on it so It better be it's best. Did I enjoy it? Of course I did. Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, fresh mozzarella, basil, extra virgin olive oil. Everything about it was excellent better than the TV. Even the President just had to have some Settebello. The personal pizza size is plenty for one or 2 people. I'd suggest ordering 2 different pizzas and halving them.  They are located East of Green Valley Parkway across the street from The District and a nice walk from Green Valley Ranch Casino. They have an excellent happy hour running M-F 3PM-6PM for $5 mini pizzas and another thing but I forgot. They also just opened their new location near Sahara and Fort Apache."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, casual atmosphere, and great customer service. I always order the bolognese pizza, but my partner usually orders the specials (and they're always good). Pizzas are cooked in a brick oven and come out pretty quickly after ordering. The crust is chewy and the ingredients are high quality. We have enjoyed many glasses of wine here, too. Never a disappointment!  We like to order a couple to go and share at Super Summer Theatre. Dining in before a movie date is a great idea, too!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this place.  We loved our waiter and I regret that we didn't get his name, but he helped develop some of their recipes.  I am super picky when it comes to pizza, honestly it was the best pizza I have had in ages.  Make sure you try the pear and jalapeño pizza. I know its a goofy combination and I agree it is, but I am here ti tell you that it is unbelievably great.  We ordered 4 pizzas and this pear and jalapeño stood out!!  Nice to see a real pizzaria.  Plus, their food is not expensive at all."}
{"text":"The wait staff was awesome and the pizza was on point.  The flavor profiles were so unique and great, this place definitely carved a memorable flavor on my tastebuds.  I was not impressed by the special of the week, a calzone which lacked ingredients.  Will be sticking to the pizza's in the future!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, great service.  Location is nice right near whole foods.  If I am comparing it to Grimaldi's - I just think they're pizza is a bit better, but otherwise pretty much on par, and better prices at settlebello"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. I've had the margarita, diavola, settebello, and one with hamburger meat in it. The pizza is really good compared to most places. I would say my favorite was the margarita. Good portion of sauce to cheese. Diavola was good, but I could have done without the red chiles. Settebello was interesting and good. The hamburger one was not good in my opinion. The dough and bread they use is fantastic. The sauce is ok, not a fan of the toppings or how all the cheese an topping slide right off as you go to eat it. Overall, not my favorite, but a pretty good spot for Napoleon style of pizza."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here!! Super fresh and authentic.  The atmosphere is also very modern yet quaint.  Delicious!  Delicious!  Delicious!  Gourmet pizza."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved Settabello Pizza! We went in on valentines night it was very busy but they took very good care of us."}
{"text":"We have loved coming to Settabello's since a friend introduced us to this fantastic pizza joint over 3 years ago!  This is authentic Italian pizza at it's finest! I almost always order the same thing every time that I come here. There Arugula salad is so delicious! Not sure where they source there Arugula but I can eat there salad with just fresh lemon and cracked pepper on it and the flavor is so intensely delicious.  For the main event I order a pizza ,no cheese with extra crisp cooked crust with marinara , garlic, mushrooms, pine nuts, olives, roasted peppers and artichokes and then I finish it with fresh arugula. What can I say...When the Arugula is great you put it on everything. The crust is nice and thin and they use a wood fire to cook the pizza.  The Menu is tight but in my opinion they have perfected what they do best. They serve beer and wine and they also do a daily happy hour.  They have a great kids meal that consists of a pizza, drink and homemade gelatin for under 6 dollars!   This is an other one of those places that is so good that we travel almost 23 miles from the other side of town to eat here.  If you love a delicious  thin crust then this is your place."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! The most authentic I've found outside of Italy. Some people are thrown off by how \"wet\" it is, but I think it's great."}
{"text":"I swear I reviewed this restaurant before....   Anyways, I had a chance to go back last night, and it was as good as I remembered. However, I don't think it deserves a five star rating because of the inconsistent service and small portion sizes.   We started out with the Caprese (tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, olive oil, and sea salt), and the Misto (meat, cheese, and vegetable sampler).  The tomatoes in the Caprese salad had seen better days, and the mozzarella was -just OK. The Italian meat selection in the Misto was quality, but I was not a fan of eggplant or olives that came with appetizer.   We decided to share 2 pizzas for 5 adults. First we chose the Margherita which was basically a cheese pizza with a touch of basil throughout. What I really liked about this pizza was the tomato sauce.  It is flavorful and not too thick and pasty -like other pizza places. Our second pizza was the Settebello which was really different and delicious. What I liked about this particular pizza was the addition of toasted pine nuts. It gave the pizza a nice crunch and went perfectly with the sausage, pancetta, and mushrooms.  For dessert we chose the nutella pizza.  This amazing dessert is their pizza dough with nutella, bananas, almonds, and powdered sugar on top. Messy - but worth it! I was only able to get a bite of this wonderful treat because my wife turns into the incredible Hulk if you mess with her dessert.  Next time, we may have to order 2 nutella pizzas......"}
{"text":"This is the only pizza spot we frequent. They have great quality imported ingredients and a friendly staff.   We are moving to mountains edge area, but will make the trip over just to get our fix!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and appetizers! Would recommend coming in during lunch when you can get some pretty good specials. We tried the Diavalo (a little spicy for me, but still good) and the Settebello (my favorite). We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It's been said that, \"Time is money, money is power, power is pizza, and pizza is knowledge, let's go!\" Settabello is the place to go to...absolutely where it's at for Napoletana style pizza!  IMPORTANT NOTE: If you don't like Napoletana style pizza that is typically eaten with a knife and fork because it is chewy/wet/runny/soggy in the center then don't eat here. It's not their fault if they serve their product correctly.   Settebello uses fresh, high-quality ingredients...they cook their pizza in wood burning ovens...they have an approachable wine list with lovely options...they have great salads and desserts to start and finish your meal with! Include a clean, welcoming environment, and Settabello is an easy \"Good as it Gets\" 5 Stars!  My favorite pizzas are the following: Margherita DOC Diavola Pizza Carbonara Settebello Bianca  I belong to runny egg yolks anonymous due to my addiction/infatuation for the golden spheres of flamboyant goodness that are egg yolks. Settebello does their Pizza Carbonara with a runny yoked egg on top. What's more? You can ask to have a runny egg atop any of their pizzas. I suggest experiencing the Diavola this way...you could also do the Settebello or Bianca this way, but even an addict such as me would leave the Margherita & M. DOC alone.  Settebello is easily my vote for best Napoletana pizza in Vegas, but they might be my favorite pizza in Vegas of any style."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast and have high expectations for my pizza. This place reminds me of home! Excellent!"}
{"text":"You must try this place!  Believe the reviews, it is that good. I always have the Caprese salad - fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil drizzled with olive oil.  So scrumptious - easily the best I've ever had. The pizzas are absolutely delicious.  My favorite is the margherita because the elements are so perfect and nothing else is needed. I've never had a bad experience from the food to the service, always excellent. I wish they would open another location in the Summerlin area!"}
{"text":"Came back a second time and the place was empty.  Pizza was still tasty but a bit soggy as others have mentioned.  I''d precook the dough for a min before throwing the crushed tomatoes and toppings on.  Drinks were still good.  Still some of the best pizza I've had."}
{"text":"Luckily, I made it here just before I moved out of town.  I ordered the Carbonara pizza, because it seemed like something I would never be able to get at another pizza place in Las Vegas.  It had pecorino romano, eggs, black, pancetta, and black pepper among other stuff I can't remember.  It was all very flavorful, and the crust was perfect for tearing and folding.  Yum.  The atmosphere is only okay; the booth was too tall to see anything around us, and I think it's too brightly lit during the evening.  The food makes up for it all though."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain....but a really good one. Service was quick. Order an Insalata Grande along with your pizza. One of THE best side salads I've tasted anywhere. The personal pizza's look big but the crust is super thin, by design. You can finish it."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town!! Unfortunately I live just across the street and it's very difficult to keep myself from eating their pizza everyday!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza. I'm from a pizza city, and in my opinion there are too many crappy pizza places in the valley. This is traditional European pizza just like what you get in France and Italy. I love the simple tomato sauce, and the fresh topping. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Settebello is one of my favorite pizza places in town. Definitely my favorite pizza place in green valley. Took about one second for me to fall in love with this Neapolitan pizza. I will admit this style of pizza is not for everyone. My favorite pizza is called the Settebello. Also love the happy hour at the bar. $5 mini pizza with one topping, absolutely!!!"}
{"text":"You get a 4 because you're inconsistent. Pizza is great when the Neapolitans are working. Hemingway on the rocks is a great cocktail. I've stolen it off you. Thanks."}
{"text":"You get a 3 because you're service is inconsistent. When Al's there, great, otherwise, Eh. Pizza is great when the Neapolitans are working. Hemingway on the rocks is a delicious cocktail. I've stolen it off you. Thanks."}
{"text":"My husbands and I favorite place for lunch hands down. Pizza is delicious:) . They have a great selection of beers and wine. We also enjoy there salad our fav is the romana salad with the pine nuts and goat cheese yum !!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a pizza lover until I met Settebello.  Anyone who knows me knows that pizza is never my go-to option. I am very picky with pizza and having just moved from New York City, I've also had my fair share of pizza tastings but who knew Napoletana was going to be my style?  The first time I was here, I feel in love.   I immediately came back the next week and brought two friends with me, one who is a pizza lover and will eat any kind of pizza you put in front of him.   What I love about Settebello is that this style of pizza features a super thin crust that is loaded with fresh and abundant toppings that is baked fresh in a wood-burning oven.    This is definitely true Italian style pizza, not American style or Chicago style or NY Style. If you're expecting this then don't don't come here.   The dough is soft and only takes a minute to cook in their wood-burning oven. I found the pizza to be soft and foldable yet at times it would have been easier to eat this with a knife and fork, which by New York standards Is a massive NO-NO. Yet in Italy, this is how they would eat it.   The blackened char spots on the pizza crust is a tell-tale sign of Pizza Napoletana that has been cooked in a blistering hot, wood burning oven so don't fret if you see some burnt crust. It's not the end of the world.   I'd recommend the DIAVOLA for spicy lovers (Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil)  and the SETTEBELLO (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil)  Ciao!"}
{"text":"Authentic Neapolitan Pizza and a Whiskey mule in a copper jar.  Bring it.  My brother in law is Italian.  Like Italian Italian.  He melts at this joint.  I melt for the cocktails.  Strip mall location, so meh there, but damn good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the District and is a great dine in joint that is fairly accessible. The service was great and the food was worth a revisit. I did peg this a 4 star only because I am still trying to adapt to the taste, which don't get me wrong is good....but different. I have a feeling that once my taste buds acquire the taste this will be a local hotspot of mine."}
{"text":"Yum! We tried This place out because of all the other good restaurants around it. It lives up to the standard set by the other nearby places. The service was great, attentive, helpful, and quick. The specialty drink menu also has a delicious Moscow mule on it. Now, let's talk about the pizza. It's very good. I love the brick oven style and this is one of the better versions of it I've had. We had the Margarita pizza and it was great. The crust is chewy and the toppings were really fresh. Can't wait to try something else off the menu next time."}
{"text":"We were in town for a Volleyball Tournament.  Stopped by for some takeout pizza.  Bought the Diavola and the Settebello pizzas.  Also bought the Insalata Grande.  All was just excellent.  Service was super as the employee giving us our food opened each box to show us."}
{"text":"Slooow service at 1:30 with more employees than customers. The days old premade/frozen meatballs were still cold in the microwaved / oven reheated dish with a undersesoned tomato sauce & good quality melted cheese. Salad was bland & without seasoning or anyother veggies...a tasteless board of bacon wrapped without a hint of dressing & good goat cheese. Both pizzas were both burnt throughout the crust & spots underneath but also undercooked & doughy elsewhere. 60 bucks for this food is criminal & the waiter argues that the black isn't burnt. Wanted to cut off any piece of the black carcoal tasting portions & tell him to eat the friggen burnt charcoal ashy pizza & tell me with a straight face it's again isn't black & burnt. SMH....we will never return to this shameful place. I can & do produce much better food myself (so much for tying your place)...minus the extremely slow, ignorant & argumentative employee who is unaware of my years of quality food preparation experience. The waiter doesn't know his customer, but is well versed in excuses for customer disappointment. Your months long experience of slinging overpriced, tastless, undersesoned, burnt & undercooked food doesn't make you a food coneisuer nor a chef/cook.  Here's a tip...if you can't get the oven temperatures & or the dough recipe right so as not to both burn & undercooked your pizza.... close it down.  Likewise if you're charging premium prices don't serve friggen cold meatballs by reheating them in a microwave, so the cheese & sauce are super hot hot & the center of the meatballs are still ice cold. One more tip you can thank me for since your oven maybe your problem (which is a costly fix) if you failed to get it installed right in the first place....brush the crust with a butter or egg wash & it will not burn the dough & use cornmeal on the bottom (unless Ypu can get the temperature & recipe right). You're welcome & while your at it laminate the cheap, flimsy & strained cheap paper menu's....it's the first sign you're resturant is sub par... attempting to pass as an elite pizzeria. And don't microwave anything. Trash your microwave now & any cook/chef who uses it. It was embrassing to bring my family here...I hope your family experiences the same disappointing dinning experience next time you go out to eat at another restaurant. Karma is the word you should be reminded of in the event your experience is way below standard. Below standard & over priced is what you are serving the community. It's a joke what your resturant produces...regardless of the high prices you charge. Thanks neighbor!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Loved our meals! Cant wait to go back!!!!! Cant beleive we didnt try this place sooner! Yummmmmmmm  As a vegetarian i ordered... the margarita pizza which was AMAZING and the Salad with pine nuts was DELISHHHHHHH!!!!!"}
{"text":"Next time you are in Vegas, save yo' lovely selves the burn & hustle of \"The Strip\" & abscond to sleepy Henderson. Trust me on this. And then as night falls skip over to Settebello by the Cheesecake Factory near I-215 and North Green Valley Pkwy and treat ya' lovely selves to the most authentic \"pizza magia di Napoli\" South of Area 51. Read up on the company schizzle  @ Settebello.Net, but if you like me, you'll wan' go over there yo'self an' see wha' the hoopla is all about.  Taste of the puddin'.   FACTOID multiplied by HYPE: Since 2005, proprietor Brad Otton & crew have been whippin' up a cross between street magic & edible art from a non-descript corner of a strip mall near an equally non-descript Whole Foods Market.   My fave @ Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana is the Vico pizza with \"Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil\". Goodness for days ..... the kind that will stand a little refrigeration and microwaving the mornin' after. Serious yummy-yums right here if y'alls allow me to wax \"neologistical\"!  My only fear is that the owners may fail to bottle \"the magia\" when they finally decide to franchise & spread out. Hear they have set up second shop in Mitt Romney's backyard (Utah). Not sure if I'm gonna venture that far but its certainly worthy of a note to self.  Max-man representin' H-City here while quackin' in me boots. Reason? I'm \"afeared\" Henderson will be swallowed hide & hoof, as Vegas or its ethos rather, spreads out like a canker sore from The Strip, from foothill to foothill: the same Vegas that like money is founded upon a skim, no, actually make that a scam.  No?  Monsieur Max, digressing in characteristic façon.  Bonne journée."}
{"text":"The Good:  Our server was really nice and attentive as well as everyone else who helped her out.   The Bad:  Everything lacked flavor from start to finish. Our app the Bruschetta was horrible, from the taste and texture to the balsamic that was \"artistically\" swirled in the center.   The pizza I ordered which was the Vico didn't have enough toppings...basically a white pizza with horrible inconsistent cuts of onions, and maybe a toddlers handful of meat...no joke! The meat on the pizza was less than 1/4 of a cup.   The canoli was by far the worst canoli I've ever had. Paula Dean couldn't even save this dish.   The Worst:  Both pizzas were under cooked. Either the chef really didn't care because we walked in 35 minutes before close or because a group of 6+ walked in 20 minutes before close or because he was too occupied making sure what looked like his family was having a better meal than anyone else.   I see and hear people rave about this place. Regardless of the friendly waitstaff, I wouldn't return due lack of flavor, lack of originality and inability to make something so simple as pizza cook properly."}
{"text":"Settebello opened their second location in Salt Lake City, Utah (my home town) a few years ago, and I always wanted to give it a try; unfortunately, I moved to Phoenix before I ever got the chance to partake of their brand of pizza.  Last weekend I was in Las Vegas (Henderson) at Green Valley Ranch for a convention, and one night as my friend and I were strolling around the area we stumbled upon Settebello.  I remembered hearing that the Settebello in Salt Lake was related to a Las Vegas shop, and after a quick look online, I confirmed that this was indeed the same company.  Needless to say, I had to satiate my curiosity and stop in for dinner.  We started with Focaccia, a simple flatbread (basically their pizza crust) lightly seasoned and served with olive oil.  For our entree we had a Pizze Bianca, a white Pizza with a few basic ingredients.  For dessert, pistachio gelato.  Considering the huge number of five star reviews of this place, I won't go into too much depth.  The general consensus that this place rocks is well founded.  The prices are reasonable, especially for the quality, the service is good (albeit a bit slow at times), and the atmosphere is relaxing and inviting.  Settebello's is amongst the best pizza I have ever had, and at it's relatively affordable price point, this place presents an appealing offer of affordable luxury and traditionally elegant pizza you can do quite regularly.  Yeah, it's not $5 hot-and-ready cheap, but as you may expect, this pizza is to Little Caesars what McDonalds is to a gourmet burger joint.  In closing, I'd like to mention what my absolute favorite things is about this place: the elegant simplicity.  Lots of restaurants these days that try to differentiate themselves as gourmet or as offering a high-end or unique dining experience do so by making highly convoluted, and often seemingly haphazard, dishes made up of a long list of vaguely fancy sounding ingredients, often without regard to how well those ingredients play together.  Pizzerias are not immune from this behavior.  Settebello takes the opposite approach.  Instead of throwing down dozens of high end ingredients and hoping you'll be impressed into thinking the whole you are getting is haute cuisine because all of the parts are expensive and fancy, Settebello understands that the whole can be, and often is, more than the sum of its parts.  The pizza at Settebello is not overly complex.  They have a simple, traditional crust, upon which they place a few reasonably simple, high quality ingredients.  You won't see a bunch of ingredients on their menu you're unfamiliar with, but that's a good thing here.  It makes their pizza approachable, as pizza really should be.  Pizza isn't exotic cuisine, it's food for everyone.  What sets their pizza apart is all in execution: attention to detail, starting with simple, but high quality ingredients, and knowing when enough is enough.  Try Settebello.  It's pizza that knows its place in the world, and fulfills its culinary role masterfully."}
{"text":"Second time at this place. We really liked the pizza, but the service is not the best. The server was very slow and seem careless. The pizza took to long, but it was good. I have mixed feelings about this place, not sure if we will go back. Oh, and like other reviewers mentioned, its too hot in there."}
{"text":"I have a softspot for Settebello & I'm really not sure why. My guess is that it stems from wanting to be one of those people who've found a pizza that blew them away. Settebello did that for me. My favorites: caprese (keep that plate for your pizza to get ever drop of the oil & balsamic left behind), arancini, Settebello specialty pizza (sans pine nuts) & the z... I forget what they're called... the fried dough balls with nutella. The only time I didn't love my pizza was when we got one that had eggplant, hoping it would be like the slices of sauteed eggplant that melted in our mouths at Custom Built Pizza. Instead, it was in cubes & seemed raw/tough still. The ambiance is quite lovely- dark wood, very lodge feeling, yet open & light during the day & rustic romantic at nite. The service is satisfactory- they pay the right amount of attention & give feedback about the menu items, which I like."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and loved our pizza's both times.  We even brought the kids the 2nd time and they had a kids meal we were not aware of . We will be back!  One recommendation that we found out about the last time we ate there - try the pepper infused olive oil for a kick - so good!"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here and it was very yummy! Staff is very friendly. I had a few questions about the menu since it was my first time there and our waiter was nice and answered all my questions.  I even got a free birthday gelato! Yay!"}
{"text":"Never a negative word with this establishment!!! Delicious food professional waitstaff and beverage offerings nicely chosen to enhance what ever direction your tastebuds might lead."}
{"text":"This place has an excellent atmosphere, clean floors/tables, great service and perfect pizza. The variety is the key because you can just keep coming back and experimenting with all the unique combinations. Personally I like the jalapeño and the margarita. Don't forget to save some room for the tiramisu. This is a great spot for a date, group of friends or the whole family. I felt like I was at home as soon as I walked in and was greeted promptly. The place is upscale quality with reasonable pricing which always makes me happy. Also the portions were hearty and not skimpy and you can tell that the meat was fresh and well prepped and not just thrown on at the last minuet like most pizzerias are doing these days...  Overall I just had to give a five because the place is so well rounded and after multiple visits the consistency in quality really won me over."}
{"text":"It depends on your individual taste in what you enjoy in a pizza. For me it was not the end all of pizzas. I guess I did not like the chewy soft crust. I prefer thin and crusty. My husband and son enjoyed theirs. I had the settebello and hated the sausage. My son had one with egg on it and he loved it, my ever loving husband who does NOT experiment had cheese. I will say the misto appetizer was very nice- wish I had stopped there."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place ever. Service was ok. We have tried various items here but our favorites have been their \"Margherita\"!"}
{"text":"I so don't get it. Soggy pizza with terrible crust with such great reviews. There are certain restaurants that I just don't get the hype when I go. I see the atmosphere is pleasant and it's fancy for what amounts to a pizza place. I had an arancini (rice ball) and a pizza. Arancini was a lousy version of the many I've had elsewhere. I'd mention where they're better but that's not right on a review for their restaurant. The pizza was some of the worst in town. This is what I don't get. Even my wife liked it which kind of annoyed me.  How can you like pizza where the crust is mushy. Maybe I'm just a pizza snob. But, atmosphere doesn't matter to me. I want a good slice of pizza. There are plenty of good pizza places around despite everyone saying that none are good. Unfortunately, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Thumbs down! The pizza was soggy and soft. This is the 2nd time I'm trying this place and will never ever go there again!"}
{"text":"The service is always the best they always have the best suggestions! The pizza ingredients are always fresh and best quality! Love the margarita pizza have actually finished a few by myself! The sangria is my favorite top it off with a Nutella pizza or the donuts that taste like funnel-cake filled with Nutella and your living the Italian dream!"}
{"text":"Mmmm Settebello.  I first had Settebello back when they were on Horizon Ridge.  I fell in love instantly.  This is authentic Pizza Napoletana.  If you are haven't had it before (like my husband) it can take some getting used to.  They use high quality, fresh ingredients and make amazing pizza.  I love them all especially Settebello and Emilia.  I usually go for the special though because it always sounds so good.  Make sure to save room for dessert like panna cotta, gelato or nutella pizza.  I've never had an issue with service but I usually order to go."}
{"text":"This place didn't start out promisingly. A sangria and antipasta plate later I was thinking it was a giant mistake to come here. The sangria was pretty mediocre and the antipasta plate was terrible. The pizza, however, redeemed all. I ordered a carbonara pizza with egg on top (my new fave pizza topping) and thought it was delic. The crust, tomatoes, mozzarella- all perfect. Was I back in Naples?? Almost a 5- if only that delicious egg wasn't overcooked. Other than that- awesome pizza!!"}
{"text":"First time here, we were pleasantly surprised. Prices weren't  bad the food was absolutely amazing. Our server Cory was extremely friendly. He Explained the menu and answered all my silly questions. Omg, they have a Nutella pizza. I definitely recommend for a quick date night or just to try somewhere new and refreshing."}
{"text":"The most amazing authentic pizza! My favorite was the Pizza Pere e Jalapeno!!! Comfortable atmosphere and friendly server!"}
{"text":"Settebello  This establishment is the ultimate pizza experience. Settebello Pizzeria shines with the thin crust model. Thin-crust pizzas are notoriously crunchy, thanks to their slim and crispy base. I came in searching for fresh and minimal ingredients to quench my thin crust pizza craving. I settled for the traditional Margherita with Crushed Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The only drawback is that the crust is sensitive and tends to burn hastily, but in retrospect, still compliments the overall package.  This establishment is popular with those on the go who are looking for a lighter pizza choice."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! I've gone here many times. The tomato sauce on the pizza is so sweet and like nothing I've ever had before. It reminds me of eating pizza in Italy. They have a good happy hour but the wait staff doesn't seem to know much about it. I think it's small pizza's for $5 and half off all drinks. Last time I went they only told me about the drinks when I asked and then I did some research and called and found out about the small pizzas. That's a great deal. They should push that more. Anyway I love this place and you will too, so just go! Ok? Ok."}
{"text":"We love this place!! My boyfriend was born and raised in Italy and is so happy to find the only place with authentic Neapolitan style pizza here in Vegas. The food and cocktails are fantastic, as well as the consistent service. We have had great service every time we've come. Tonight, our server, Taylor, was very patient and kind even though we ended up being there after they had closed. We appreciated his hospitality, as well as every other server we've had since we started dining here!"}
{"text":"Met some girlfriends for dinner. Not a big pizza fan, and with it being happy hour I decided to check out their bites menu. I was excited when I saw their meat and cheese plate. I was surprised at its low price. Now I know why, because it was probably the saddest meat/cheese plate I've seen. 3 pieces of meat, 1 slice of white cheese, and a chunk of parmesan (that was the best part) Poor presentation, but when you're hungry, you eat. One of my friends had their pasta and enjoyed it. Some of the ladies had pizza and liked it. I had a couple of drinks which I thought were priced high by a $1 or $2. Our server was nice and accommodating. As for returning, I would again with friends, but would not go out of my way to visit because of the food, it was just ok."}
{"text":"looking for a new pizza spot, was at Whole Foods & saw Settebello. Went in checked out the menu. Came back to give it a go, Pizza outstanding. Nice thin crisp crust. Split a salad, so total minus alcohol was 25 bucks. Good martini, pretty good wine list. 50% off wines offered some weeknight. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, even better customer service. We came in for the first time an hour before closing on a Sunday night. Tam was wonderful, and his recommendation for the Jalapeño pizza was spot on, he's an asset to this restaurant, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nope, not a fan at all!  It's a quaint little restaurant and the staff are okay, as for the food..... well, if you're wanting real pizza... this is NOT the place?    Look at their MENU first!!! The portions and price are perfect, just not the pizza!    This place could have potential, if they offered real pizza choices!!!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely horrible, it was mushy, sauce and red pepper were straight out of the can. Our waitress was amazing, I will never go back"}
{"text":"This place does it right. My family and I frequent Settabello  d we love it across the board. Pizza is done in the traditional Napolitano way. D the salads are great , I highly recommend he Panzanella.  The pizza is perfect light and fluffy dough made with the highest quality ingredients and they always feature new creations monthly. Order a bottle of wine, sit back and enjoy a nice relaxing Italian pizza experience.  The service is attentive as well and I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Great pizza with awesome ingredients. You have to try the panna cotta for dessert. It is amazing with the strawberries and balsamic reduction"}
{"text":"Loved the taste of the pizza. I'm a huge fan of thin crust, and they do the thin crust very well! The pizzas are a good size for one, if you're really hungry. Or perfect for two if you also share a salad! We had a merlot which was also very good, and went very well with our meal. The service was excellent as well, our waiter was very polite and gladly explained the menu and gave us good recommendations. Would come here again for sure."}
{"text":"Ok I see lots of 5 stars but being a NYer I would say its good pizza not great. I like the thin crust and the folding and eating but the crust got soggy and couldn't hold the toppings on the pizza. The salad was bland. The kids get a nice portion and of course the gelato that came with it was a hit. My friends got the bomba and if you like caramel, chocolate and peanut butter it's fabulous... At least my one bite was lol....love peanut butter! The service was good and quite attentive. If we are in the neighborhood on a playdate who wants pizza we would go again, otherwise there are other restaurants right next door we might pick instead. And with all the pizza places in Vegas there are others I would run to first...."}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT Highly recommended by Italian locals, so this place is legit.   The music is horrible, please fix it.   Two happy hours, the second starts at 8p  APPS Artichoke Crostini -Oh yes. Texas toast thick crostini, very good.  Crostini Con Crudo -- the best one! Fully loaded with meat and cheese and a sweet glaze  PIZZA -- All the flavored are amazing. The slight burn on the bottom is also great. The only complaint is that the bread is very doughy.   Pere E Jalapeño -- WHOA! Not too sweet, not too spicy.  A must try, it's one of the best on the menu.  Bolognese -- The ragu sauce on this pizza is insanely good.   Special of the Week - Not sure what was on this, but order it anyway."}
{"text":"As soon as we arrived to Vegas for a short weekend, we stopped first at the restaurant. There we had the white pizza without red sauce, that was a very good choice.  The pizza is very light and delicious, we also had their salad.  It's already a set thing that when we are in Vegas, we pay this place a visit.  Check them out."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the second time and I'm starting to wonder why I don't come here more often. Perhaps it's the location, it's pretty hidden in the backside of The District over by Whole Foods.  The pizzas are roughly the size of a dinner plate so you get a lot of food. This time around I tried the Del Cafore - Wood Oven Roasted Fennel Sausage, Roasted Peppers, Roasted Onions, Mozzarella, Basil, & Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Keep in mind this pizza has NO tomato sauce and after eating it, I'm a big fan. The waitress asked me if I'd like to add tomato sauce to it. I'm like \"Why don't I just slap an Italian person right in the face? I want it authentic!\"  I said that in my best Italian accent... she was impressed.  A few of my friends have lived in Italy and they've said that this pizza is about as close to Italian pizza as Las Vegas gets.  The caprese is good too, but I really don't know how you could screw up caprese."}
{"text":"Just had Happy Hour there again.   Never disappoint.  We had pizza, Arancini, warm beets and misto for my little daughter and I.  Of course we had way too much food.  But the bread was too amazing.  Everything else was just a bonus.  2 drinks on top of all the food, under $40.  (Before 6pm weekday).  Staffs were friendly.   My 4 year old loved her pizza. I enjoyed my wine and food. Win win win.  Please come try."}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza here. The crust is so fresh along with all of the other ingredients. They make a great Moscow Mule also."}
{"text":"The food and service are awesome.  The Margherita DOC pizza is really good.  The piatto misto is too.  They have a great selection of beer and wine, as well as whiskey.  And some great happy hour deals.  They also have some great desert options."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great salads, and exceptional service each and every time I've been there.  I was happy to find out that there is a location in Pasadena also."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great brick-over/wood-fire pizza, this is it!! Hands down one of the best in Vegas and beats Grimaldi's by far!   So what makes their pizza the best brick-over/wood-fire? I'm going to guess its a combination of things including the light dough, fresh tomatoes sauce, and the special toppings like prosciutto ham. The dough and crust is unbelievably good. I noticed they don't use a lot of flour or corn meal under the crust like other pizza places which helps preserve the flavor of the dough.   Today we ended up trying the Settebello & Bolognese pizza. The Settebello has a combination of items including ham, sausage, mushrooms, and mozzarella featuring their regular tomato sauce. The Bolognese has a rich creamier bolognese ragu sauce with fresh mozzarella. Both are equally epic!   If you haven't tried this place yet and you love this style pizza, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Before I even stepped in the place, I could smell the quality of the food, which is excellent, the service is great to!   Plus they have good craft beer. I'm definitely returning."}
{"text":"I lived in Rome for 3 years and have searched high and low for a good pizza restaurant since moving back to the States. Settebello is the real thing. I feel like I'm back in Italy when I have their pizza.  Absolutely fresh high quality ingredients and the types of pizza they make are hard to find elsewhere.   Friendly staff, service is usually excellent, but can be slow when it's packed. The restaurant can get noisy so don't expect a quiet romantic setting. I especially like that I can use my Italian when chatting with some of the staff.   I highly recommend Settebello."}
{"text":"1 star only because I have to put anything....but how sad to see this place have such horrible customer service....my husband and I used to love this place....we sat for 10 minutes waiting for our server and no sign of this illusive Adrian they say was supposed to help us....mind you there was probably only about 5 other tables sat...Never coming back to this place with so many other wood fire pizza locations there's no point.  The only plus side was our busser who got us some water and apologized over and over again for the crappy service....no wonder this place has looked so empty lately"}
{"text":"Love this spot, very good food and great prices!! Settebello pizza with insalata grande salad my favorite"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great cocktails and the pizza carbonara is the bomb. Does get busy, so I usually come here during the day."}
{"text":"Vico pizza was the best I've ever had. I'm here for the second time to have the same pizza. I can't get enough."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on Saturday night and my Emilia pizza blew me away! I havent stopped thinking about it since and cant wait to go back and get it again! We sat outside on the lovely patio covered in beautiful flowers. It was great!"}
{"text":"I am a BIG fan of the Settebello location down on Green Valley Pkwy. As this location on Sahara is closer to home, I gave it a try! Gotta say - the Green Valley location makes better pizza! The crust was much doughier at the Sahara location while GV's is crispy and light. My Emilia pizza had corn on it at GV and did not have ANY corn on it at Sahara (my favorite ingredient in that pizza!!!)   Ambience and decor is nicer at this Sahara location with a more industrial chic look. GV's location is a little more of an italian restaurant feel. I love the patio at GV - wish Sahara's location had one too!  Overall, I think the food is still good but it's worth the drive down to Henderson to their other location. I would recommend the two locations work on getting more consistent recipes between the two locations."}
{"text":"This was my second time here, and it was just as amazing as the first time.  Setebello has the BEST PIZZA in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Been to this location plenty of times. Great food nice set up love this place. Highly recommended for napolitano pizza!"}
{"text":"We have experience this place via dine in, take out, happy hour and take out for large party.  Each experience was consistently delicious.  I've almost tried every pizza and my top two are the emilia with added pine nuts and Bianca.  The donuts with Nutella and the Nutella pizza with added strawberries are both definitely hits!  The special thing about this place is the pizza Napoletana is soft and foldable.  I've seen other reviews and some think it's not fully cooked but the style is considered \"wet\". The char spots on the crust give you he flavor of the hot wood oven burning cooking style. It is best to experience this style in dine in however take out for us was just as satisfying.  Happy hour pizzas $5 each for a smaller version definitely a great deal. Happy hour 3-6 Monday - Friday.  Give this place a try... I'm craving it right now."}
{"text":"Just ate there... Or at least I tried to. As soon as my dish came there was a really long brown hair cooked into my pizza. The waitress noticed and grabbed the plate. She told me she'd bring another pizza to me but instead I cancelled my order and the waitress disappeared. Gross! Would never recommend this place.   I also wanted to mention my table was sticky. Obviously it hadn't been wiped clean. Anyhow, plenty of other reasons why I wouldn't dine here but I'm sure the hair is the biggest one of them all."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here .  It had been recommend many times and assured us it would feel like Italy. I think our server was Justin not sure but the service was fast, friendly and good. I hate the new \"artisan \" pizza that has a blop of cheese then a huge leaf then a blop of cheese.  Having just vacationed in Rome that is not how it is done!!! This pizza was out of this world and the sauce was not the red canned tomato crap on most pizzas, it was delicious.  Then we finished it of with the best gelato we have had since being in Europe.  It was a great night and so inexpensive we cannot wait to go back and try the prosciutto platter we saw walking by!!! T"}
{"text":"Maybe i just ordered the wrong foods, but really, if you can't get a margherita pizza right, i'm afraid to order anything else. I do not understand how this place got such great reviews. I started with a white sangria...no fruits, and it tasted like a watered down limoncello. This was followed by the beet salad....EVERYONE knows that you canNOT toss soft cheeses, such as brie or goat cheese, in a salad, it has to be added after the toss. Otherwise this happens: \"Where's the cheese? Why do the beets look like they have mold growing on them?\" Yes, this happened....for reals. Now about that pizza. First, it was watery and burnt - that is a feat that seems impossible, but it happened....for reals. The top was soggy and watery. The crust was \"purposely overcooked\" - but the charred flavor of the crust was overwhelming enough for me to put the slice down and start feeling like my stomach was developing cancer. I will not come back, and I REFUSE to recommend or bring anyone here."}
{"text":"Good pie. Nice bar. Good service. Up side good prices down side it's in Henderson ughh. I would make the trip here weekly if it were in LV or summerlin even. Couple TV's to watch sports at he bar if your into the whole professional sports soap operas. Patio looks inviting would be nice if the weather was more suitable for outside dinning, alas we reside in an inferno."}
{"text":"Only place where i eat pizzas no other pizza place taste like Settebello! restaurant is very specious with nice study furniture. large area bar. they offer a daily happy hour from 3pm to 6pm. then from 8:30pm to closing  i recommande their caprese salad, the emilia pizza, the vico pizza, the 5 cheese pizza! the crust is very thin and just so so good! it doesn't stuff you like other pizza :)  order a glass of Moscato and then you are in pizza heaven   staff is very pleasant  great place, good pizza, good wine what else???"}
{"text":"Pizza is the best I have ever had. Very tasty!!  I loved the thin crust. Salads are good as well. Mitch was our waiter. He was excellent. We be Back for more pizza soon. Thank you"}
{"text":"Not sure how I haven't reviewed this place before but this is absolutely 100% my favorite restaurant. I am constantly impressed with how amazing their pizzas are. Every single one I've tried becomes my \"new favorite\". They have wonderful atmosphere- really feels like you're in Italy. The servers are always extremely nice- I've had Vanessa multiple times and she is wonderful-and the hostesses are extremely nice."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was much more casual than I expected.  The outside of the restaurant is a stark contrast to the inside.  It's a cookie cutter commercial building with plain written all over the facade and a boring font \"Settebello\" sign overhead.  Inside aged brick walls, wood trims, iron art accents and exposed copper vents added to a slightly more inviting and warm ambiance.  Our server was very personable and attentive.  We split an Insalada Grande and shared a Settebello pizza.  The salad was brought out already split and was the perfect size; mixed greens, tomato, artichoke, mushrooms, olives, pine nuts and large shavings of Parmigiano Reggiano tossed in a flavorful vinaigrette.  The pizza came out not long after we finished our salad.  It looked amazing covered in tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, pine nuts, basil and fresh mozzarella.  I love, love, love the crust on a neapolitan pizza.  And this one was amazing; soft and chewy with a little bit of amazing grilled char on the bottom.  Everything we had that little extra gourmet flare to it that I've come to expect with a neapolitan style pizzeria."}
{"text":"I just love this place the salads the pizza. Happy hour absolutely excellent. Friendly staff. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"What is a better post work out meal other than Pizza!?  Had a lunch date with my bestie on a Tuesday afternoon. It was pretty dead so we got sat and served very quickly. We opt out of sharing a pizza because she wanted to go a vegetarian route and I am all bout my meat. I got the Stelebello pizza minus the mushrooms (yuck!). The meats on the pizza were fresh. I loved the basil and nuts in it. It was probably in the top 5 best pizzas I ever had.   We also ordered some fruity beers. I forgot the names but we shared a apricot beer and a strawberry beer. That strawberry beer is amazing. Ever since we've tried it we have been trying to find it at spirit stores. So good.   The one thing that was a little disappointing was the cannoli. It just didn't meet my expectations. It was a decent size but the shell was too tough. The filling wasn't as good as others I've tried. We also got Affogatos! omg those were to DIE for. I got the hazelnut flavor and it was so good. Best one I've had.   I will definitely come back. It's not on my side of town but I will drive all the way over there just for the pizza and affogatos! Yum.   Also, I didn't get to ask but is pepperoni a topping here? I didn't see it on the menu at All.."}
{"text":"This place NEVER disappoints me. Probably the best pizza place In Las Vegas hands down. I've never left this place and thought anything less than 5 stars.  The Settebello pizza is a trademark. I get it every time. It's become my number one pizza BUT lately we've been getting the Diavolla. It's got crushed tomatoes, peppered salami, roasted bell peppers, crushed red peppers,  garlic and mozzarella. It's got a great kick. That pizza is slowly reaching for the number one spot. Also if you go during HH, you can get the Diavolla as a pizzette for just $5! What a steal.   The appetizers are amazing also as well as the salads. During HH they have this crostini con crudo which is so good. The balsamic reduction on it is delicious.   The best part about this place is the Tirimasu dessert. It is one of my favorites. It's not too big where you won't be able to finish it after a fulfilling meal. But it's not too small where you'll be like I need another. It's perfect way to end an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Cool off with some homemade and seasonal gelato! Flavors such as: blueberry cheesecake, peanut butter cup, and cookies and cream."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Chianti was very nice and smooth. We had the anti pasta plate and everything was very good and very fresh. The Settebello pizza was the best we have had in Henderson.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Can't beat living in the center of The District.  How wonderful is it to be walking distance from this gem.  This place is delicious; the pizzas and appetizers are full of flavors.  The wines and cocktails are inexpensive.  Fiancé and I ordered a bottle of wine for $30, and it tastes like a $90 bottle sold everywhere else!  Settebello has a rustic-Italian ambiance.  Very cozy as well since there's about 20 tables, a bar, and a kitchen in a 1,000sq.ft. area.  But I like it!"}
{"text":"This Settebello location is absolutely impressive when it comes to the interior. Maybe it just hit me because it was new and I didn't expect a pizza joint to be so nicely decorated. Would recommend for a nice low-key date night with a movie theater just steps away.   Their pizzas  come in one size, which I approximate around 10-12 inches round. Perfect for sharing between two people or feeding a very hungry individual. The Pizza Napoletana dough is softer than your average pizza and is meant to be eaten with a knife and fork. The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven and I would liken it to a thicker version of Indian naan bread. Wonderful texture, in my opinion. Ordered the Vico pizza  with sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, and basil. The sausage was nicely seasoned and all the ingredients complemented each other well.  I made sure to save room for dessert which I think were called Bombolinis. Bombolinis, beignets, donuts, whatever... I love!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza. Our Waitress was extremely snobby. Im sure it was just her.. However had salad with bresaola was great very simple nice clean flavors.. The Pizza is awesome Best Pizza and best ingredients so far in Vegas."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the style and quality of food here.  Simply prepared with high quality ingredients, the unique food and preparation speaks for itself.  These type of neighborhood restaurants are always good - but this one is particularly unique in what they offer and the quality of what they serve.  Joined some friends and family her the evening, shared an Ensalada, Pizza Del Cafone, Pizza Lasagna, et al - all was excellent, service was simple and efficient - food and ability to talk with the table guests was great."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, it is a regular on our rotation of restaurants. And that says a lot since we mostly eat at home and like to cook. The arancini are amazing, crispy outside and luscious inside. Love the salads, we keep coming back to the Insalata Grande. It's simple and delicious. All the pizza's are outstanding but our favorites are;  Vico- white sauce pizza with Italian sausage and fennel Jalapeño Jam- you'd never know there was a jalapeño used The Settebello- tomatoes, pancetta, sausage etc. The dough comes from Naples and you get nice bits of char on the edges from their gorgeous oven. You will not be leaving any crust on the plate when you're done! Enjoy..."}
{"text":"The location is close to GVR and Whole Foods which is great. The pizza was something different with the background on why this pizza isn't cut into slices...but that is as much history as I need about pizza. We all know that the Italians got pizza from Spain...yada yada. The review on the pizza was delicious with the crust being a bit chewy. The ingredients were fresh and the reviews are spot on."}
{"text":"One night while driving around Village Square and changing my mind from Rubio's, Jollibee, Yojie's and Buldogi's, I realized this restaurant was here. Since my obsession with Grimaldi's changed to my obsession with The Pizza Kitchen, I've been pretty pizza-ed out, but still wanted to try their Napoletana style pizza. We had just missed happy hour, but I'm glad we got to enjoy their regular menu first. Their beet and goat cheese salad was fresh and a very hearty portion size for two people. The crostini con crudo featured high quality meat and cheese, but I don't think I'd order in the future since the meat kept on getting stuck in my teeth. We decided on sharing the Settebello pizza which was everything I wanted a sausage pizza to be. I enjoyed their dough and thought they had the perfect amount of salt in it. Everyone should always save room for dessert here. From all the amazing choices, we decided on the crostada, which is a tart with ricotta, chocolate chips and Nutella. It's actually not too chocolatey and very well-balance. Our dedicated server was delightful and gave us amazing recommendations, and any staff that helped us along the way was very friendly. The only complaint I have would be that the lighting in the restaurant is a bit off and distracting - it made for some weird shadows over the tables and gave me a bit of a headache. Otherwise, no other qualms about this place and hope to be back here soon!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this establishment. It is very pretty inside but a bit too warm. The cheese plate with focaccia was excellent. The wine reasonably priced but slow to get to the table. The pizza seemed undercooked. I could not even pick my piece up.  My husband had to go through 3 sets of utensil to get a set that was clean. Our pizza did not come out together, my husbands pizza came out first. The staff was unaware and in attentive. the sun was shining into my husbands eyes. We had to ask the shade to be lowered.   We ended the evening with tiramisu which was also very good."}
{"text":"A nice ambiance, reasonable prices and most importantly for me is a real awareness for the Gluten-free needs of those who request.  The only improvement would be service, the servers do a good job but each time I've gone there is simply not enough of them. They don't complain about it but it is noticeable."}
{"text":"When a friend suggested Settebello's as having the best thin crust pizza in town, I was immediately intrigued and, of course, had to try this pizza for myself. While the pizza was absolutely delish (the capriciossa sans prosciutto is my fav), it was the insalata grande that stole the show. The folks at Settebello's figured out the right mix of ingredients between the greens, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, pine nuts, parmigiana, and (the key) vinaigrette (seriously, folks... all too many salads are absolutely drenched in dressing and, thus, inedible). It's rare when it's a salad (especially at a pizza place!) that makes me want to go back for more and more.... but, when it is, well, you know it's a special place. I heart Settebello and it's insalata grande. TRY IT... soon!"}
{"text":"This place was amazinggggggg! The waiter was super nice and gave us some recommendation. We ordered the Settebello and some type of Japlaleno pizza. It was soooooo good!!!! I DEFINITELY recommend this place!!! :)"}
{"text":"Short Version: Strip mall gem.  Long Version: Are you kidding me? How many times do I have to learn the lesson of not judging a book by its cover? Guess I'm not there yet, because this place rocked my socks off. It's a small venue with a lot of flavor. Brilliant dishes (tried quite a few), very fair prices, a wide ranging menu (including vegetarian and vegan options), and staff that is so down-to-earth and friendly that it feels like home. I sincerely wish they had a franchise with a restaurant near me, because I would go there all the time. I know this is off the strip by a bit, but it is so worth the drive. Everything I tried there was delicious; everything. Even the water. Don't waste another moment; go for lunch or a casual dinner. You'll love it. GO NOW!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of thicker perimeter crust, you'll be a big fan at first bite. Minus one star for soggy middle (to be fair, we took two pizzas home in a professional pizza bag. it was 8 minutes from restaurant to our home.)  Service was outstanding! We will be back."}
{"text":"The old Settebello location on horizon ridge and stephanie must have recently been taken off yelp, but it gives me a chance to update/make my review for this restaurant.  Let me start off with background of myself.  I was born in New Jersey and I'm Italian.  That being said, my favorite places to eat at are Pizzerias and steakhouses.  It has become a quest of mine to find good pizza in Las Vegas.  Alas, I bring you Settebello  Located across the district in the heart of Green Valley, Settebello delivers on all fronts as hands down my favorite Pizzeria currently in Vegas.  This place has the freshest ingredients, the perfect crispness, and just right assortment of cheese, gravy (or sauce for the west-siders), and toppings.  I usually stop in once every two weeks and treat my palate to the plethora of bliss off each bite of a Settebello pie.  Personal recommendation is the Prosciutto Crudo pie.... Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Inferior experience, fails to justify the prices. You can get the same soggy pizza with good quality ingredients at Blaze for literally half the price, and then some.  The night we went, the person in charge of cutting the pizza could not even cut the pizza properly, or the slicer was dull. So we had to cut it ourselves.  Primary service was good, secondary service horrible. Was brought a self-serve unit of peppers in response to a request for cheese.  Doubt that we'll be back."}
{"text":"The best pizza you will eat in Vegas! The bread is amazing along with the service!! I get the special every time can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"GREAT food for a reasonable price!!! Love this place. Highly recommend the \"Settabello\" pizza!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza joint in Henderson. If you hate Pizza Hut Domino's Papa John's etc. you'll love this place. Also great salads and meat and cheese platters."}
{"text":"I haven't had pizza like this since I was in Italy in 2005. Totally worth the wait we had in the evening and the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The panna cotta was okay, but not like real Italian panna cotta - less heavy and more flan-ish. That was my only real complaint. The ingredients in the pizza were superior and I am already bragging about this place to everyone I know.  This is definitely my favorite pizza place, not just in Nevada, but the US entirely."}
{"text":"What can be said about this place that hasn't been said about world peace? It's wonderful but, vera pizza is possible now.  I am somewhat of a regular here and need to get in the habit of checking-in,  but I typically get a Settebello pizza, unsliced, with spicy oil.  The reason for this, and after tasting all of the pizze on the menu, the Settebello has, by far, the best flavor combo if you're into a more savory, earthy flavor in pizza.  My favorite in Las Vegas and the US, period.  This is what real pizza, not greasy NY or Chicago style bs pizza, should and does taste like."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here, given all the positive reviews.  However I was very disapointed.  The pizza was way overpriced, lacking on toppings and literally RAW dough.  I have eaten Pizza all over Italy, so I am familiar w/ the concept, it was just executed poorly.  When we tried to complain the Manager was terribly rude and begrudginly credited us for the raw pizzas....eventually."}
{"text":"Yum!  In any big city pizza places aren't hard to come by.  Some are fine, some are good, few are great.  If you're looking for a New York, Jersey, or Chicago style pizza, Settebello is not your place.  This is Napoli style. Before you try it, drop the expectations of what you know of pizza.    My first visit to Settebello was on a date.  The date was mediocre, but he got major brownie points for choosing the venue!   That was probably the sole reason any more dates followed... This was at their old location on Horizon Ridge, now they've moved to a more visible and accessible location next to the whole foods in Green Valley.  I was in love with their pizza after my first experience.  Check out their website for their story of their imported oven (one of the super hot brick ovens that cooks the pizzas in under two minutes) and information about the origin of their ingredients.  These pizzas are thin, Napoli style crusts.  Cheese is fresh mozzarella (depending on what pizza you get, it's not standard) applied as splotchy discs - not the half inch thick layering of rubbery mozz that most American pizza eaters are accustomed to.  They treat cheese as it should be treated, less volume, more quality.  Aside from the crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside crust, the toppings are the reason I return.  High quality tomatoes mingle with marinated mushrooms, caramelized onions, and they serve pizzas where pine nuts and artichoke hearts come standard... Sigh... My response to these pizzas makes my boyfriend jealous."}
{"text":"Extremely good pizza. This is what pizza should taste like. Everything on the pizza tasted so fresh and amazing.  The brochetta was so delicious especially with the pesto sauce. My first time having it and it definitely won't be my last.   I had the most amazing pizza as well. Didn't really know most of the ingredients so I just asked our server Tyler what he recommended and he said the Settebello which is a sausage pizza. Their sausage is made in house btw it was amazing. But I love my pepperoni so I added it on to the pizza, it's only $3 and it's totally worth it. But here they call it Calabrese (Calabrese = Pepperoni) But it's sort of a bit spicier pepperoni. OH MY GOD, best pepperoni I've ever tasted. So fresh and crisp and it has a lil kick to it. So freaking good !!!!!! My pizza also came with bacon, olives, pine nuts. And the tomato sauce is so delicious and fresh. I loved it.   My boyfriend got the Vico pizza with the marmalade on the side. And that cheese on that pizza was so yummy. It's like a sweet and creamy cheese. It has no tomato sauce on it. Comes with prosciutto, he's a big fan of that. But honestly, the pizza that I got.. the Settebello was the best pizza I've ever tried and you should try it to.   I realized that I've been to this restaurant before but in Santa Monica at the marina. And the quality of the food and service is exceptional at both locations. If your craving some authentic and fresh pizza, you gotta come to this place."}
{"text":"Settebello has been our go-to pizza joint since we moved to Henderson. Their gluten free pizza is the best I've ever had!  They used to have a special on Mondays - $5 margherita pizzas all day. I won't lie - we woujld get 2 of them, gluten free, and at least 1 of the 2 would be eaten by the time we got home less than 20 minutes away.    Their gluten free crust is out of this world. I love it when the crust gets a little charred - adds so much flavor to an already delicious pizza. The crust isn't paper thin which is good - it is thinner, but the crust is still soft and flavorful. You can't go wrong with wood fired anything!  Their ingredients are good quality - their pizzas are simple and to the point. Delicious, perfectly executed, and consistently good service. Always ask what their special is that week, and definitely get a drink- they have plenty of good ones at the bar!"}
{"text":"This pizza is a little slice of heaven. Pizza is a little pricey for my budget, but the taste makes up for the price. I'm so glad they put one in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Settebello is has a cool vibe and great ambiance. They are tucked away inside the Village Square where the movie theater is. It a small restaurant with maybe a 10 seat bar and you can see the brick oven right when you come in. They have a small menu. They have some random salads and even some yummy desserts but I was there for the pizza. My friend found this place when she first started dating her current bae. She pushed me to come and said its the best pizza she has had aside from Italy. It is different from your normal Pizza hut or Domino's. It's thin and toasty. I like the Diavola. It has crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell peppers, crushed red peppers, garlic, mozzarella, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I put a little extra crushed red peppers and each the whole thing... Keep in mind it's thin. I feel like I'm eating two regular slices of pizza. They also have some nutella based dessert which are a must try at least once. We had zeppole for best friend's birthday and they made them a little different since she doesn't like nutella. They made them will the nutella on the side and added cinnamon which was really cool of them to do to. We have been a few times now and I think best friend is right. They hire pretty people. All of them are pretty. It's a random thing to say but when they don't know how to get ice off a table it kind of makes me laugh. We had a little accident and split a yummy Mint Collins. It took a couple trips to get it cleaned up then someone put our new napkins right in the wet spot. They also dropped some of the drink on my phone and didn't apologize or even acknowledge it.  It was more funny than anything but they were so busy for the anniversary I was just ready for my $1 pizza. Overall its a great place to grab a pizza and sit and talk with friends. The flavors in the pizza are great and different from the rest."}
{"text":"Went into little lunch there today had a horrible service we did at least a good 10 minutes until someone greeted our table it was completely dead nail drops and the server finally came Got our drinks didn't come back for another 10 minutes to take our order. The pizza was limp and not crispy all the way through.....so u can understand when u grab a piece and everything falls off because the center is not cooked all the way....my salad that came out first had line pine nuts that I asked to take off still came to the table with them....had to remake the salad and our pizza took about 20 min to come out. Clearly the girl during the day that was working  should take a pen and paper to the table for orders. The place was dirty and should be closed down for horrible food and service!!!  Work on that and maybe you have a chance!"}
{"text":"You can almost miss Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana as you drive by...with the mild tone of the logo above the restaurant, amongst a storefront of other businesses...I wonder if I would notice this otherwise ample space if I wasn't looking for it. But once you come in!..the only missing you'll experience is a gentle longing to return to Settebello.  Located in the Village Square Plaza on Sahara and Fort Apache, home to standards such as Archi's Thai Café, and local's favorite Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dogs, resides a king of yet another unique concept: Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana.  I am not a huge fan of Pizza, but when I want to have a bite of that cheesy and wonderfully Napoletana crust, this is one of the absolute best options in Vegas! And here are a few reasons why:  1. The crust is flame blistered for a bit of crunch that soon gives way to a soft, fold it in your hands or cut it with a knife and fork texture that is only found in Napoletana crusts....not the most popular style in town, but one of the best IMHO. 2. There are many seats for larger groups, as well as intimate booths. Want to watch your sports team's score? Grab a seat at the bar. 3. The Aroma of the open-fire, domed, pizza oven, fiercely baking your favorite Pizza is simply intoxicating.  4. Don't care for Pizza? Settebello offers a variety of Salads, Antipasta, and appetizers, such as the splendid Aracini, classic Meat Balls, or Insalata Grande.  5. Many choices of wine are available from Italy, as well as other locals around the world, and are offered by the glass or whole bottle... or by two bottles if you are like me and my company. 6. Service. Their service has never fallen short. It doesn't matter what time of the day you come in, the staff is always professional, attentive, and knowledgeable.  My most recent visit, found my love and I coming in unannounced, part of a group of 9, on a Sunday night...luckily for us, there was a big table for us to all sit together. The food came quickly, was fresh, and tasted amazing, while wine and water never missed a proper pour.  Arguably the best Pizza in town, according to many a Pizza Snob, Settebello also hits the spot for me. So if you find yourself craving some great pizza, come have a slice or two with some friends, or order a whole pie for yourself!!!  -2018 review #6-"}
{"text":"Wow 665 Reviews? I'll make this quick.   I've driven past this past numerous times and finally decided to pop in for a few drinks and a slice of Bolognese pizza, which my friend highly recommended. First off the service here is off the charts, right when you walk-in you're greeted and shown a seat. Water is dropped on the table and within a few minutes a server is greeting you and asking for drink orders while giving menu recommendations.  We ordered the Bolognese pizza, baked Gnocchi, and the Insalata. The salad was perfect for two and had mixed greens, balsamic vinaigrette, cracked pepper, shaved parmigiano. A very refreshing salad and a great green break with all the carbs I was about ingest.   The baked Gnocchi was ridiculous. Piping hot straight out the oven, covered in melted cheese and house marinara. I don't think I've ever had Gnocchi with marinara before, always just covered in pesto or white sauce. A must pre-meal snack while you're scanning the menu.  Bolognese Pizza. Just think pizza with a slow simmered meat sauce marinara and light addition of cheese all on some incredibly flavorful soft crust. Marone! This pizza here alone is worth the trip to come back and check out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent traditional Italian style pizza from a traditional oven. Single serving size, great crust and fresh toppings. Something on the menu for everyone. The pizza is the same as served in Italy but it is a bit pricey at $10-15 each. A party of three hungry persons would need 3 pizzas and salad, and the salads are excellent as well. If you are OK with the cost the pizza is well worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza here was not as good as I hoped. It's kinda soggy and definitely not crunchy at all. When you hold up the slice from the crust side it sags down and needs to be folded to be consumed, which was a surprise.   The insalata grande was very good but I wish the pizza was better. The ingredients were quality but I was disappointed that the crust had no crunch.  The cannoli dessert looked great but didn't taste as good as it looked. There was an overpowering taste in the cream that I couldn't put my finger on but really ruined it for me.  Overall not a great experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Recommend dining in over take out. The pizzas are FRESH and HOT out of the oven... the crust is perfect .... the flavors all meld together into a mouth-watering-can't-stop-eating experience.  Their salads are really good as well.... and big enough for 2 people to share.   I am partial to the arugula salad... fresh, crisp... light dressing.  It's really the only time I like arugula is at Settebello.  At home it just tastes like weeds... at Settebello's it tastes so good I usually eat the whole thing by myself because I don't like to share it.  Their pizzas... like I mentioned are so yummy you can eat the whole thing in 1 sitting.... And at the end of the meal you don't feel bloated or greasy or icky like with normal pizza.  So... order your own... cuz you are more than likely NOT going to share it.  Settebello's pizzas are not your typical greasy, overly cheesy, thick crust affairs.  These pizzas are light and gourmet.  Their crust is super thin and the cheese is a complimentary topping... not smothered all over creating an impenetrable layer.    Location:  In the Whole Foods shopping center across from The District. It's a small shop and it's usually pretty crowded so go early or plan to wait a bit. Note... there is a small bar and you can eat at the counter there so if that's something you are willing to do you might find that as a viable option."}
{"text":"Beat pizza I've ever had in Vegas . Truly authentic Italian style , good as the pizza I have in Napoli when I visit my family every year. I truly impressed , the salads are awesome as well ,"}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite spot for pizza. The gluten free crust taste like roasted marshmallows and it works! I have never has a bad thing here and the customer service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"OMG people would you stop acting all knowing about food and this is real Italian pizza and all that crap. It's dry it's boring it's tasteless it's not happy, the whole idea of pizza is gone with this one. There are way better places.  And it gets cold in twenty seconds.   No good"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever had...please don't go waste your money...I did....Their calzone is not good either..It's just flat..Flavors are weird..They just put olives on the pizza without cutting them....I wouldn't even rare it 1 star"}
{"text":"Another enjoyable meal. I ordered a insalata grande to start, fresh Parmesan and plenty of olives. Our pizzas were made to perfection. My Margherita was yummy, I liked the amount of cheese used and my crust was baked just the way I like it. The capricciosa was also baked to perfection , the artichokes and prosciutto were just right to give it flavor . Only thing negative I noticed this time around was the panacotta, it was delish but the presentation was slacking. Ordered the traditional one with strawberries and noticed it was sloppily made. As you can see on my photos the the dessert looked much prettier my last trip. Our server Ryan was pleasant and he brought our food quickly and refilled our drinks without us even asking. Easy parking and outdoor seating available. Another great experience, we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I know I give too many restaurants a 5-star rating, but I would give Settebello six stars if I could.   I went for lunch and it was not overly crowded. The appetizers were delicious and our pizzas came within 10-15 minutes of ordering them. The pizza itself makes me drool just thinking about it. Fresh mozzarella, the sauce is made of crushed tomatoes, and the seasoning was divine. I learned that authentic pizzas aren't cut, but I had mine cut anyways.   The 12\" pizzas are big enough to split with someone else if you get appetizers. I'll be going back again for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for authentic Italian Pizza and salad. My husband and I ordered the Margherita and Diavola individual pizzas. I was satisfied with our waiter! I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Settebello is now my go-to pizza place in town. I am a huge fan of Neapolitan style pizza. The thin, chewy crust with large charred air pockets, combined with the simplicity of the crushed tomatoes, fresh Mozzarella di Bufala, and basil leaves makes for the perfect pizza in my book.  Settebello executes this perfectly, and I appreciate how humble they are about it. Though they offer a unique, authentic product that many people are not familiar with, they are not snobbish about it in the least. Despite their style of pizza's serving manner (unsliced and to be eaten with fork and knife), they gladly offer to slice the pizza for you any way you would like. This is a great way to prevent the customer from feeling alienated while still offering a quality authentic product.  I have tried the Margherita DOC and the Carbonara, and enjoyed both of them greatly. I wish that the egg on the Carbonara was left whole with the yolk runny, as I have seen it served in other pizza shops offering eggs on pizza. However, I'm sure they would accommodate this request if asked.  Prices are reasonable: $10-13 a person for pizza.  I am so glad this place exists!"}
{"text":"I order the namesake pizza - pretty good - sausage not spicy - cheese, tomatoes it wasnt dry - I got without mushrooms - I couldnt finish it and the oil and crust was not finished - panne cotta good - service good - value better than most"}
{"text":"I heard about this place in one of the local entertainment mags and was drawn in by the promise of the authentic Nepolitano chef and that this is one of the 12 restaurants in the U.S. with a 'vero Nepolitano\" certification, which means 'true Neopolitan'.  I don't know true Neopolitan from a hole in the wall, but I know sometimes \"holes in the wall\" are family restaurants with the best food.  The mag also said the meats were done by Mario Batalli's father.  Okay, done - I suggested it as dinner before the movie we were going to see at Green Valley Ranch.  I have travelled a lot, and you know you can't get real Italian gelato or pizza in America, and that has been the fact since this place.  I don't have superlatives enough to describe the greatness of this food.  All the pizzas we have tried are simply spectacular, thin crusts with a little char on them from the real oven they use.  The calzone (they call it something else) is really really really really to die for!  Desserts, perfect!  I want to share this, but I want to keep it to myself because I hate crowds - however, they are open 11 a.m. to something like 11 at night, so you don't have to go right at dinner, you can go early,which is what we like to do.  Off-off-off-off strip and true world class."}
{"text":"Eh.   I was excited--nay, thrilled to try this place for the first time. Since they are certified for their pizza from Italy I had to try it. There are mixed reviews, but despite my better judgment we went for it yesterday.   We ordered their misto plate, basically pizza bread with meat and veggies, their settebello pizza and their lasagna pizza. The misto was salty from the bread to the meats paired with it. The veggies were cooked then chilled, which wasn't pleasant to me. As for their pizza, it's okay. The crust is chewy, toppings are okay and the sauce is between acidic & tangy. Overall, edible but nothing I'll crave again.   Good experience with service but the food is too mediocre for my taste. Sorry fans of settebello--I am not a fan."}
{"text":"Vegas isn't supposed to have pizza like this! This place is transplanted from Utah and rocked my world the first time I had it. UNREAL!  Settebello simplifies a pizzeria.   The blending of three things make this pizza what it is,  the oven - I swear, it's their oven the cheese - only mozzarella the crust - is oh so chewy  An exact Napoli pizza.  [Wipes, drool off keyboard.]"}
{"text":"Nothing to Write Home To Mama About  Please take this with a grain of salt as this is our first visit.  Based on the interior of the restaurant, we had high hopes for our first binge meal after five weeks of almost no-carb fasting. The chairs and tables are warm dark wood and leather, as are the booths. Nice high ceilings and a beautiful large bar area, segmented off from the main restaurant.  That's where the niceness ends unfortunately. I'm not sure if this is a family owned business, but the service was neither prompt nor overly friendly. We came in the middle of the afternoon with only two other customers in the place. The host seemed like he was just wandering aimlessly around the dining area and just happened to see us. The booths are not exactly comfortable, as I think the backs are a bit too tight and push you forward to the table.  Quick summation of the meal:  Arugula salad (Panzanella): probably the best thing we had. Homemade croutons and little dried pieces of proscuttio topped with large shavings of parmigiano.  Meatball appetizer: five small meatballs in so-so tomato sauce and topped with basil slivers. Meatballs were cold (as in freezer cold) in the middle and not especially tasty. You can see that the cheese on top is not even slightly melted, which is rather indicative of the overall temperature of the dish.  Salsiccia e Friarielli (sausage and broccoli) pizza. Sausage was not bad at all, but appeared to be tossed on the pizza in very uneven clumps. The dough was also not bad, but the chef definitely needs more experience with his or her oven. Burnt on the outside, raw on the inside. This can happen now and then with a good hot pizza oven, but added to everything else it just added insult to injury.  So, salad, pizza, appetizer. $50.00 for lunch. Not a great first experience in the Village Square on Sahara. We might visit Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana sometime in the future, but it might take a few months to get the bad taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Settebello Pizzeria. I'm originally from Naples and therefore have a thing for traditional Neapolitan pizza. Settebello did not disappoint. I could tell from the moment that I walked in that the aroma of fresh tomatoes was in the air.  I ordered a Margherita DOC pizza which came with buffalo mozzarella as any good pizza should. This was spot on and delicious, everything from the flavor to the crust and texture were perfect.   For dessert I ordered a tiramisu which was delicious as well. The tiramisu was very creamy and good, but I thought the mascarpone was slightly too heavy on the coffee for my liking. Ultimately this is a personal preference though and the tiramisu was still amazing despite this.  My only comment was about the service which was a bit lacking considering I went during lunch when there were just a few other patrons in the restaurant. Once they served me my pizza they didn't really come back, so I had trouble flagging someone down to order dessert and ultimately get my check. From where I was seated at the bar I noticed the staff sitting in the back playing on their phones so this caused a bit of delay. If the slower service was due to a lot of guests that's one thing, but to have 10 patrons in the place max and still have to flag waiters down was disappointing.   Other than this it was a great experience and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great pies!! Go there during happy hour and save a lot of money. The desserts are very good also."}
{"text":"Although this place gets a little cramped during peak dinner times- the food makes up for it.  Never have I had such delicious flavors in PIZZA.  Light crust, melted cheese, the most amazingly flavorful olives I've ever had...etc.  Delicious.  The drinks are a little pricey and menus could be more descriptive but oh...that pizza.. Don't forget the massive cannoli too.."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've had in Vegas.  Had the Crushed Tomatoes, Prosciutto Cotto, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil (minus ham & cheese, so I had it vegan style).  True Italiano!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour. The food was amazing! New place for pizza. I'm super picky and like natural stuff which they use here. Happy hour is great wine is BOGO we had moscato delish!!! We also tried the four items they offer on the happy hour menu...all amazing!!! Will come again soon and will tell my friends about this great find! :)"}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome. I've eaten at both location and I like the atmosphere at this one better. They have a great drink menu also and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Only Tony's in San Francisco has better pizza than Settabello's."}
{"text":"The pizza is really wonderful, one of the best in town. They are mostly individual size pizzas, if that's what your looking for. I love the margarita, it's so simple and good but I've had many of them and they are all exceptional."}
{"text":"This spot is amazing! I travel Vegas for work and I'm always looking for a great eating spot. This place is truly authentic. I am a fan!  Bolognese and Margharita my fav"}
{"text":"Ever since I saw this restaurant featured on the Food Network, I quickly bookmarked the venue and told myself that next time I am in Las Vegas area -- I would come by Henderson and order a pizza! :)  Luckily, on our drive back from Grand Canyon, my husband and I stopped by Settebello! I found out later that this restaurant has multiple locations, two in Southern California actually - in Marina del Rey and Pasadena.  We were seated immediately around 2:00 pm on a Monday afternoon. We ordered:  (1) Settebello Pizza, $13.50, Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil - absolutely delicious; we shared a pizza; it came with 4 pre-cut slices. yummy! not too oily which is nice; and very flavorful  (2) Insalata Grande $8.50, resfreshing salad and good portion size. it could be shared among 2 people; dressing was light and just the right hint of tangy-ness.   Now that I know this restaurant also exists in SoCal, I wouldn't mind going there to check it out sometime. :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza !!  This came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.   Its in the Whole Foods side of the District by Green Valley Resort.  Great atmosphere for conversations no loud music.  Everything we had was so good.  Next time in town we will visit again!"}
{"text":"I am from NJ where I would enjoy pizza at least 3-4x's a week.  When I moved out here I couldn't find anywhere near the quality of NJ pizza (no, not Metro or Girmaldis either).   I kept hearing about Settebello and Joey's Brooklyn Pizza.  I finally tried Settebellos.  It is amazing.  Would do well in any borough of NYC and NJ.  I strongly recomend it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Happy Hour in Las Vegas.  At 8:00 pm you can try mini versions if their pizzas, sides and specialties.  All of the dishes were delicious and the staff was terrific.  If you enjoy Neopolitan wood oven pizza, this is the perfect spot."}
{"text":"This place is just \"good\". Not bad, not great.  The vibe is real chill, but the Italian decorations seemed force so much so that it was disingenuous.  The caprese was just okay. The tomatoes were half the size of the buffalo mozzarella, which kinda sucks. Always like to have large tomato slices so that each bite you get tomato and mozza.  I had the margherita doc pizza which was full of flavor, but the middle parts of the pizza were too thin to hold any sort of ingredients. In other words, when you pick the pizza slice up it flops. And not to mention the sauce has a lot of water in it so it drips off the pizza, which gets messy.   Other than that the service was excellent. If your looking for a pizza place in Henderson, come, it's a really good and decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Different from big chains. They use mozzarella  di bufala, which is a thing in Naples. Excellent  restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll admit... I'm a pizza snob, 100%.  So, for this place to get five stars is definitely saying something.  I tried this place with a friend on a whim.  Someone we had met had recommended it and we were looking to grab a bite before hitting the town for a bit.  We went in and I appreciated the small menu.  Small menus are my favorite because it makes me feel like the restaurant really knows what they do well and focus on that, rather than offering pages of options.  We settled for the beet salad and the pizza bolognese.  I don't love beets, but my best friend does so I settled for her.  She LOVED it.  And when I say loved it, I mean she has dreams about this salad.    Now, the pizza bolognese sent me to heaven and back again.  Normally I don't go for what we on the east coast call \"specialty pizzas\" that have the works on them.  Being a Jersey girl through and through a plain pie with a nice, crispy crust is a dream.  So I went with what was closest to a plain pie and that's the pizza bolognese.  Instead of regular tomato sauce, the crust is covered with meat sauce.  Well, I was amazed that something could be so good.  I didn't even want to go out anymore!  I would have sat there and eaten this pizza all night if this were an option, sadly they were closing since we got there so late.  There is no other way to describe this pizza other than to use the word \"perfect.\"  It makes me extremely nervous that I will be living extremely close to Settebello in my new apartment.  I will definitely have to practice will power and stop myself from ordering this pizza every night."}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian-style pizza in Vegas. Real wood-burning oven. My native Italian friends and I are regulars. Love the decor, especially the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"So the place is nice and clean. Great menu with lots of variety and healthy choices. I orders the beet salad and a pepperoni pizza for my son."}
{"text":"Pizza is back to being nice and thin. Still the pizza best tomato pizza sauce.  Simple and fresh.  The Margherita DOC and Bolognese are favorites.  The staff is friendly and considerate.  Happy hour size is nice for a snack too, as I love it so much I often pop in alone spur or the moment.    At first it seemed it would be difficult to bring home, because of it's style.  In actuality, it heats up beautifully, and if you'd like it crisp you just put in in your oven or convection right on the rack.  You will be craving these pizzas once you try them."}
{"text":"Great use of fresh ingredients but not filling. My husband and I did find it tasty but still prefer some other pizza joints to this. It's one of those places that after your meal you talk about picking up a snack or more food on the road on the way home. The service we got was ok. We were rushed in and out"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this little pizza joint out for quite some time and last night I finally had the pleasure of digging into some of the tastiest Italian cuisine I've ever tasted.  The ambiance in the restaurant can be confusing. When I first entered, I thought I was a bit under dressed, but after being greeted by a t-shirt laden host and looking around at other patrons, I realized this wasn't the case at all. Casual dining in a fancy environment, I can dig it!   I've heard murmurings that this is the only joint to offer authentic Neapolitan pizza in Las Vegas and the menu stated that the oven was built brick by brick with ash from Mount Vesuvius. Whatever they're doing back there, they're doing it right. This was hands down the best pizza I've had in quite some time, second only to Ray's in NYC and possibly Lombardi's.   If you're looking for a place to dine, don't pass up this restaurant. I'll most definitely be back and in droves. I love this food!  For those interested in price, I had an Italian beer, one salad and one full pizza shared between two people and two cappuccinos.The total was $32. Delicious AND affordable!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Village Square center, Settebello is divided into two sections, both of which are serving up delicious eats. On the right hand sand, you've got a standard dining area with booths and tables. On the left, you'll find additional seating including some high tops and a full bar. One of the coolest parts about the setup here is that everything is very open, so you'll be able to see the wood fire oven from just about anywhere you sit.  The menu itself is somewhat small. Aside from about a dozen pizza options, there's only a few other choices of salads, antipasti's and a couple meat trays. You're not going to find any pastas or sandwiches here but they've also got a decent wine list, a few cocktails and a handful of dessert options.  This was our first time here and were told the pizzas were personal size. However, at about 12\", it's a good size pie and for me, I'd only be able to finish the whole thing if I didn't eat anything else. As suggested by our waiter though, we ended up sharing a salad and pizza between the two of us. That was a perfect amount of food, while still having room for dessert. ;)  For the salad, we decided on the Romana. I'm not normally a huge salad eater but I couldn't get enough of this. It comes loaded with arugula, artichokes and speck, then it's topped off with a good amount of goat cheese, pines nuts and dressing. The flavor was just amazing! It's salty, it's a bit sweet and the textures perfect. Everything on the plate was incredibly fresh as well. Just a great salad all around that I'd highly recommend.  Moving on to the pizza, we ended up going with the Settebello to share. Want to talk about flavor? Talk about this pizza. It might seem like a lot going on when you look at all the ingredients but everything comes together so perfectly. The crushed tomato is great and their mozzarella is ridiculously tasty. And my new favorite pizza topping might just be pine nuts. Now, want to talk about crust? Yup, talk about this pizza. It's almost bread like in the center with a very soft, chewy texture but the outside is crispy and gets that awesome char from the wood fire grill. My one and only complaint about this pizza is the amount of toppings. There was a very small amount of sausage compared to the other ingredients and some slices even had no meat on them. Not a huge deal, but the could definitely be a bit less stingy with the meat.  They're dessert worthy too! While a bit on the overly sweet side for my liking, the Bella Mela is definitely worth a try. The combination of apples, cinnamon, almonds and mascarpone is so good, you'll probably ended up wanting to eat the whole thing alone, even if you are full from dinner.  So, when it comes to pizza, we all know there's no shortage of options here in Vegas. But if you want legit, Neapolitan pizza...Settebello is where it's at! Prices aren't bad and the service is excellent too. A solid 4 stars and a must try in my book!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've ever put into my head! My god is it divine. The crushed tomato sauce is to die for.. PERFECTO! haha My fiance and I come here as much as we can and the service and food is always wonderful. Very clean. Go there now!"}
{"text":"When I first tried this place I was very surprised about the style of pizza because I had never tried it before! But I absolute love it. It's not like the pizza you can get from Pizza Hut so be ready but you won't be disappointed. I had the white asparagus pizza and it was amazing! I came in on a Saturday night and I had Bethanie she was very quick and super attentive! She has really good customer service and that's the most important part other than the food of course! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I love Settebellos but IT IS NOT A PET FRIENDLY RESTAURANT (even on the outside patio). So if you go make sure you dog is a certified service dog or leave them at home because they will ask you to leave."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've ever had. Service was great.  Extremely reasonable. Delicious. The arugula salad was also to die for. A must go."}
{"text":"I'm not here to write about the food. I really can't complain about the pizza cause it was so good! For the salad and rice balls and the pizza I had I'd rate it a 5 STAR no doubt. The reason why I would give this place a one star is because of their horrible customer service and our server named Tricia or whatever her name is.. before I explain I would like to point out that this was my first time eating with my parents and my one year old son at this restaurant.  Our waitress/server is extremely unprofessional and rude. My son is one year old and is very playful; and as he plays around and gets excited he tends to move a lot in his high chair. Well while Tricia was taking our order my son accidentally tapped her.. BUT of course she took it as my son hit her (keep in mind he is one, so really how hard can a one year old hit) .. and in her response is \"don't hit me buddy because I will hit you back.\" and in her tone she was not kidding..  I have've let that respond slide; BUT the second time she came around to drop of plates and I believe was our starters, my son again moved and almost touching her and she gave my son and I a really dirty look and gave us a nasty attitude. On top of that she barely checked on our table but she check the table behind us, beside us and in front us constantly but barely paid attention to mine and my parents table..    In conclusion this restaurant has amazing food BUT I would advice not to have Tricia as your server!"}
{"text":"Great pizza .. I have people from Chicago come and visit here and they always want to come here and have pizza they love this place I'm born and raised here and my boyfriend is from Chicago and we both think is the best pizza .."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, amazing, amazing! Every time I go to Vegas we have to visit. I went to high school in Naples, Italy and the pizza is just like home. I get together with my high school friends here and we have a great time and it takes us back to those days!  I normally go with the Margherita pizza and get a caprese salad, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Half tempted to go down to two stars based on the service. There were five of us co-workers, so as usual we asked for separate checks rights away. We all asked for water except one guy who asked for a soda. So at the end the guy looks at the receipts and says \" I didn't charge you for the soda, don't worry about it\". That's because you charged me for the soda! So I politely waited and told a different server about the soda charge and it was correct but my new bill had charged an extra .50 for the meat.. Heck with it! I paid for my meal plus .50 They were nice but waiting and waiting for refills and our order was too much.    The pizzas were good. We kinda did a spread where we all shared various pizzas. My favorite was the margarita (sp). The claim to be part of a secret pizza cult and this maintain true Italian style pizza, so of your in the mood for NY/ American style pizza then this isn't the joint to goto. The pizzas come in personal style only. I do like the food. Quite a bit uppetty on their prices. But then again look at the location.  Probably wont come back, with cheaper choices elsewhere for the same flavors. Nice ambience and a great setting for a date night"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza served by pleasant staff. The spicy pizza was hot enough that is did not have to ask forgot sauce!"}
{"text":"The smell of pizza welcomes you as you enter the restaurant. You can see the beautiful oven from Naples, just like the one that I saw when I went to a pizzeria in Napoli, Italia. We didn't want to wait for a table, so we sat at the bar. Over large marble slabs, the bartender reached across, put down two bar napkins and asked us what drinks we'd like.  We ordered:  Del Sole: Vodka, Campari, Limoncello, Orange Citrus, and some tart yet sweet concoction, mixed up to create a 16 oz. sunsetting blended color of deliciousness that paired quite well with the pizza, possibly because of the tomatoes' acidity. Del Sole means \"of the sun.\" Oh what fun!  Negroni: Gin, Vermouth, and Campari, came on the rocks and with a lot of strength. This 8-ouncer'll do you in on an empty stomach, and although it doesn't completely complement the food, it's got a kick to it. Negroni means \"big black ones.\"  After she gave us drinks, she put our order in for the Antipasto called Involtini di Prosciutto, meaning Wraps of Prosciutto.  Involtini di Prosciutto: Two wraps of thinly shaved prosciutto tightly stuffing arugula together, just like a bacon-wrapped hot dog, with shaved parmigiano reggiano and mini chunks of goat cheese to create a flavorful party for your palate.  While we were snacking on that, our bartender asked us what we'd like for our meal.   We chose:  Margherita Pizza: San Marzano tomatoes crushed into an amazingly sweet and slightly tart sauce, basil, mozzarella, and olive oil. The pizza crust came out with air bubbles just like the pizza in Naples. However, the crust was not crispy like the crust in Naples. Either way, the sauce is truly intensely packed with flavor and the pizza was great none the less. We got the pizza unsliced because that's how Italians get their pizzas.  Settebello: the same awesome tomato sauce, pancetta, mozzarella, thinly sliced oven roasted fennel sausage, white button mushrooms, pine nuts and basil. Pine nuts go very well with basil. This pizza is an art piece meant to be devoured as a savage and enjoyed as a king. It was absolutely delicious. Again, we got it unsliced, but next time, we might just have to slice it.   We didn't order dessert as I had tiramisu waiting at home, but we did see the bartender keep scooping ice cream for spumoni and we overheard her not being sure whether it was cherry or strawberry, but nonetheless we're sure it was delicious.   We will be back for more and to try different things on the menu next time. Arrivederci."}
{"text":"FIRE OVEN  Grabbed some pizzas from here for lunch & it was AMAZING!! We had to do togo becuase we had people waiting at home for it.  The staff was very friendly and frequent in making sure their guests were taken care of.   It literally only took 15 minutes for our pizzas to be ready from the moment we placed our orders.  We got the pizza of the week with pesto sauce & tomato w/ garlic which I thought was hands down AWSOME!  Bianca was another one we got with the balsamic reduction!  We got one other pizza but i forgot the name.. The dough was chewy and crispy! So good & you could just tell the cheese was fresh! Definately will be back to try the dining experience more & the pizza would probably taste so much better when it is Hot!"}
{"text":"You may enjoy the atmosphere however on a cold wintry day even in Las Vegas the food does arrive cold. Very similar to the way that the wait staff is. Very unimpressed with their staff. Never asked how the meal was because then we could have told them that it was quite cold where we were sitting. The table although nice for atmosphere, is very unsanitary since it's unfinished wood. My friend when she was dishing up ur own salad dropped several pieces of salad as well as pine nuts etc and they just settle into the nooks and crannies of this table. I will say that they do give you a lot of whatever toppings are listed for that pizza, are on that pizza. We had the settebello pizza and it did have plenty of sausage and mushrooms and pine nuts on it however not too much cheese. But all in all it did come with the variety of toppings that was stated on the menu. I'm glad I was warned about the pie being wet, that is not my preferred style however this was the style and it was something that I was aware of. All in all a so-so experience"}
{"text":"Great pizza & terrific appetizers. Service is fair"}
{"text":"Wow. These reviews must have been paid for. I got a settebello pizza and Im underwhelmed and dissappointed. Soggy, cold and chewy with almost no ingredients. 2 small underdone pieces of sausage. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've returned back to the establishment again and the service was much better and the food great. Staff super friendly even though they were extremely busy."}
{"text":"the only reason why i gave this place  3 stars is because the food is great,, service is super slow every time i seat at the bar..... love the nutella pizza"}
{"text":"Very different from Grimaldi's. The crust is chewier and not as crisp as Grimaldi's. I had a Margherita pizza and the Insalata grande and split both with a friend for lunch. Perfect portions for both of us. Salad was perfectly dressed with just the right amount of cheese. Pizza sauce was delightfully fresh. I'll definitely be back. I like the location too. It's tucked away from the main drag of the Strip mall."}
{"text":"We came here because someone said this is the best pizza joint ever. First, the parking lot is just crazy. It's in the middle of a shopping center and movie theatre in summerlin. We got lucky tonight and found parking right away. It took a few minutes before someone realized we were standing there. Once she greeted us it took at the most about 5 minutes before we were seated. Not long at all. We ordered a mixed green salad and margeretta pizza with no basil. I didn't read the part on the menu that said the salad would only be drizzled with oil. My bad. Had I seen it I would of asked for vinegar. The salad was good. The pizza was on a super thin crust which is what I like. A little crunchy. Fresh tomato sauce. Portion wise wasn't too bad either. We were able to split the pizza and salad between two people and walk out full."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever...  Super top-notch ingredients lovingly distributed on a perfectly made crust.  Our group of four girls shared a pizza with artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and mushrooms, along with the caprese starter and a salad.  I loved the interesting and fairly priced selection of Italian wines, and my smoky-tasting red matched the pizza perfectly.  To show how tasty their toppings were, I even ate all the mushrooms -- and I typically despise mushrooms!  The reason for the four stars?  The tomatoes in the caprese were big, but didn't taste super fresh and juicy like I would expect, given how great their other ingredents were.  Also, the service was bleh, verging on rude.    I didn't dock a star for this, but I was surprised at the lack of ambience.  I mean, I understand it's a strip mall in Henderson, but I wasn't prepared for the utter blandness, almost quick casual vibe of the place.  Just something to be aware of when you go -- which you most definitely should!"}
{"text":"From a picky New Yorker, I can say it was great tasting and great quality.  It is not New York style, however, the choices and varieties offered are unique and quite good.  We had the brisket pizza and while it's a stretch from dough sauce and cheese, but it is a real treat to the taste buds.  We had the margarita also, it was good."}
{"text":"Settebello is actually certified for its quality and authenticity by an Italian government agency. I only know of one other place (in Marina del Rey, CA) that carries this certification. This is as close as you can get (in Vegas) to actually eating in Italy. All their ingredients come from Italy. You can even buy bags of their Italian flour and take them home to try your own recipes. The place is just sensational. Very reasonable, especially their Happy Hour specials with $5 appetizers and 2-for-1 drinks."}
{"text":"Ive been here on 3 different occasions and each time this place does nothing but awesome. The crust is light, chewy and has a slight crisp to the edges. Sauce is fresh with a nice acidity mellowed with silky mozzarella cheese. There isn't a bad pizza on the menu and the kitchen is fast cranking these killer pies out so no long waits for food.   Eating pizza with a knife fork.. really?"}
{"text":"Great fresh flavors. Very nice pizza. Great ingredients. Only warning would be you can finish a pizza by yourself. Im not sure if they have a bigger pizza as we just got the pizza with extra sauce and cheese. There was no option for small med large.  Great for a date but not necessarily for a party. love the flavors and the simplicity of the tomato sauce."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good. Their place is close to empty, which means service is quick. The Diavola, Capriciossa, Settebello, and Margarita pizzas are all great. My personal favorite is the capriciossa (pardon my spelling). They have started decreasing their amount of toppings, but it's still a lot. The dough is super soft and delicious, with a great char flavor. The salads are nice and so are the desserts. GREAT deal on Mondays. A satisfying experience if you stop in and eat. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I spy a big pizza pie in your eye!!! (pointing finger)... There being several choices of eateries within Village Square, we happened upon Settebello with front door parking.  It must've been a silent invite.  Good to see it's not crazy busy.  We were seated within a minute of walking in.  Quickly, snapped a photo of the funny happy hour chalkboard.  Got seated at a booth and flip page menus were left on the table to view.  So glad it wasn't confusing.  But with all the flavors and ingredients, it took a moment to decide.  Let's just start with ice waters and a pitcher of white sangria.  Perfect pick on the white sangria to bring out our cheerful sides hahaaa.  Wine glasses are $5 during happy hour which is 'til 9pm on Thursdays.  Now we know to order by glass instead of pitcher for happy hour.  We tempted our taste buds with artichoke crostini; followed with Settebello pizza.  It was described with Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  OMG that was great!  It wasn't so much the thin crust cuz it was soft; usually not my preference.  But if anything has flavor scores, for me I just be quiet and GRUB.  I had no expectations trying this place out, and the food has me starry eyed.  Okay maybe the sangria was a booster.  Interior is beautifully designed.  I love the reused wood tables, and the mix of metals and stones.  It's modern but they use a brick oven for their pizzas and you can actually watch them being made.  There's bar stool seating around it for closer observation.  Need to give Matt, our server, applauded acknowledgment for his polite attentive customer service too.    They have a separate bar area where sports fanatics can watch and consume.  The environment overall felt comfortable to chill and relax with the warm colors of the furniture and fixtures.  At the same time Ness and I felt like we were in the spotlight, on our stage.  We were only having a catch up conversation.  Recommending Settebello for any reason cuz the food is really flavorful!  Will return to try other pizzas.  Also, cuz their white sangria causes laughter spurts.  And we love to laugh :D"}
{"text":"I initially thought Settebello would be like Grimaldi's and I wasn't very excited to dine here.  Boy was I THRILLED to find out it wasn't and it was AMAZING.  It was a beautiful afternoon so we sat out on the patio and had outstanding service.  I cannot remember the girls name but she was blonde tall and was SO personable.  When she realized we were first time diners she recommended dishes and drinks which were great!  For drinks I got the Old Fashion which was good.  My friend tried the gin cucumer drink which was good as well.  For our appetizer we had the meatballs which were very flavorful and delicious.  For our meal we had the pizza that has the egg in it.  It was OUTSTANDING.  The server said it was kind of like a \"breakfast\" pizza but it was still perfect for dinner.  We decided not to get dessert however I will DEFINITELY be back and will have to try it!  The only negative about our experience was the plate my friend was given had a big chip missing out of it but that's ok. We loved it here!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I had the diavola pizza and was amazed how quickly it came after we ordered. 5 minutes and presto piping hot pizza. The peppered salami and roasted red pepper were the highlight on the pie. The crust was crisp yet chewy at the same time. Service was quick and we had a super friendly server who was very informative and you could tell she loved her job. I forgot her name but she was amazing!!!!!    I ended up bringing half of my pizza home and doesn't really reheat well. Next time will share a pizza.    Nice modern decor and great ambience. Will come back and would like to try their salads as well."}
{"text":"Came here a second time to have dinner with a group of friends and the experience was much better. I ordered the Emila Pizza again but this time they said they couldn't add because ot was an Italian restaurant and they don't make chicken?? Either way, it is still the best pizza I've had! And of course the cannolis are to die for."}
{"text":"I ordered the Capricciosa. Settebello offers authentic Italian pizza, the proscuitto was very tasty, the service was fast and i enjoyed my visit. I will go back when i have the craving for pizza."}
{"text":"Ever since arriving in Vegas from Australia I've been a big pizza complainer.  You see, I don't like New York Style pizza which I find too oily and soggy and I don't like Chicago Style pizza which I find too wet and saucy and not really what I even consider a pizza.  Now that i have alienated 95% of US pizza lovers, on with the review.  Today while craving pizza I did a little research in the hope of discovering some pizza around town that was neither of these two personally despised styles. I found Settebello on Yelp, liked the look of the photos and the reviews and the wife and I headed there for an early 11AM pizza.  I ordered the Diavola and wife had a custom built pizza with mushrooms and pine nuts.  The service at the restaurant was great, drinks were promptly refilled and the pizzas arrived fairly quickly.  I enjoyed my pizza, it tasted good and the ingredients were clearly of very high quality. I loved the peppered salami on mine. The only drawback was I found the pizzas became very difficult to eat and the middle sections became a bit soggier than I like. I look for a dense, slightly chewy crust about 2/3s of an inch thick and this was very thin in the middle. I think id be awarding this six stars if the crusts were about twice as thick as they are now.  Of course, despite the fact that I really enjoyed my meal here, this doesn't solve my pizza problem. Pizza is a food I want to grab on the way home to graze upon for the remainder of the evening in front of the TV or computer and this is most definitely not that sort of pizza.  In short - not what I was really looking for, but a high quality pizza restaurant for a sit down meal, not 100% to my personal tastes but probably the best tasting pizza I have eaten in Vegas. That's not saying much, but it's still a thumbs up overall."}
{"text":"Pizza is better than some. The crust is soggy and pizza is difficult to eat. Decor is cool and service is good."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Vegas but for the true pizza connoisseur...it's not as good as Tony's Pizza Napoletana in SF.  I ordered the margherita which was really good.  My wife ordered this Mediterranean pizza which she loved.  My kids, however, were disappointed that there were no real kids options.  My 8-yr old wanted his usual pepperoni but had to settle for salami.  My 5-yr old wanted a cheese pizza but had to settle for a margherita.  When he saw all the tomato sauce (minus the cheesy mozzarella) he was not pleased.  I'd like to return when I'm craving pizza, but I doubt my kids would want to go."}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent here. I have only ordered pies for take out and they are excellent just like you would get in Italy. The pies are smaller than the average pie and crust a bit thicker so I would order extra. The pizzas are more expensive too!"}
{"text":"Sad to give this 1 star review. I have dined at the Henderson location and loved it. I do live right behind the summerlin location so I thought ordering 2 pies to go was a great idea. Wrong! Crust was burnt and the center of the pie was super greasy and full of water? I returned the pies and watched the cook remake the pizzas his expression on his face was not pleased to make the pies again. Not only because I have been a chef in Las Vegas for 20 years but I could feel the heat blasting all the way by the counter. They need to learn how to control there fire. Burnt is not cooked!!!!! I expressed my concern that the thermostat on the pizza oven was passed 900 degrees and he said well the thermostat had been broken for years. Right then I knew my pizzas would come out the same they did the first time. At this point I was beyond younger and I just wanted to eat. I just felt cheated that they knew the oven was way to hit to cook the pies properly and just giving me a card for a \"free\" pizza was going to see me off to enjoy my burnt undercooked pizzas. Thank you settebello"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas. Taste almost like real Italian pizza made with Italian cheeses like Mozzarella di Buffala, Gorgonzola, Parmigiano... Nice fresh salads and Italian appetizers.  And of course don't forget to end your meal with a Nutella and strawberry pizza !!!"}
{"text":"Mama mia! I have never had pizza so good in the state of Nevada. While I am a huge fan of the Secret Pizza spot at the Cosmo, and Broadway pizzeria, this is something completely different. Those places are how Americans eat pizza, this is how Italians eat pizza. The closest thing I've had on the west coast is Ken's Artisinal in Portland (also incredible). With that being said, I've only been to Setebello twice and the visits were within 3 days of each other because I couldn't wait to go back. I had the pizza Setebello, their signature pie, both times. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had in Southern Nevada. Great selection of beers, both Italian and domestic."}
{"text":"I tried this place with a friend for the first time and I thought it was great. We came here because my friends business associates are Italian and they said this place had the most authentic Italian Margherita pizza. The food was tasty and the service was impeccable. We ate on the bar side and even with bar guests, the bartender was very attentive. He gave suggestions for pizza which we went with: mozzarella & tomatoes salad, Margherita pizza and the white pizza with jalapeño jelly and spicy salami and red onions (sorry, could remember the name). The food came out quickly and the ambiance was really nice. I look forward to going back in the next week or so."}
{"text":"Simply?  The best pizza I've had since I moved here. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law took me to Settebello's a couple of weeks ago while I was visiting Vegas for work. It was wonderful and I look forward to going back next time I'm in town!   It's a cute little pizzeria located in a shopping center across from Green Valley Ranch. We arrived around 8:30 and there was a 15-20 minute wait for a table so we decided to sit at the bar since it was wide open. We started off with the Insalata Grande; Mixed Greens, Artichoke Hearts, Pine Nuts, Roasted Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Olives, Parmesan Reggiano with a balsamic vinaigrette. It was a delicious!   For pizza we decided to choose two and share. Our first choice, Pizza Lasagna; Crushed Tomatoes, Wood Oven Roasted Fennel Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Ricotta Cheese, Mozzarella, Parmigiana Reggiano, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and our second choice...Capricciosa Pizza; Crushed Tomatoes, Prosciutto Cotto, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The pizza lasagna was my favorite! The dough was thin, chewy and had a great charcoal flavor. Next time I would ask for the pizza to be well done so it comes out a bit crispy. Each pizza bursted with flavors from the fresh ingredients and the flavorful crust.   I'm from NY and know good pizza and I have to say these guys are doing a great job. Different from your usual NY pizza but still excellent!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for helping us (visitors for a week) find Settobello.  Ordered a Settobello, Bolanese & a special (white veg pizza with spinach)...all point on and definitely we will b back before we leave"}
{"text":"With the recommendation of my sister, I tried this place for lunch today. I ordered the Emilia pizza while my beau ordered the Vico. Service was fairly on point and ambience was very casual. It was not busy at all since it was a weekday and so service was quick. The pizzas were good, fresh ingredients and a good size. However, overall it was good, not great. The crust was a little bit softer than I would like and it seemed like it lacked seasoning. Would I come back? probably would but I would try to go to other pizzerias I've had around the area."}
{"text":"Their salads were delicious esp the pear prosciutto and the pizzas were great. They do need a changing table in the rest rooms. Some of us dine with our families that include children."}
{"text":"Of all the food genres, I think reviewing a pizza joint is the most difficult. There are dozens of crusts, and textures to choose from. Dozens of ovens it can be made in. Dozens of ways to fuel that oven. Dozens, maybe hundreds of toppings to choose from AND infinite ways to combine them. You get the point right?  So with that understanding, I must preface my 3 star review by making my pizza tastes public. There are three ratings on my Iron Chef judging sheet.  1) Thickness of the crust (in my case the thinner the better) 2) Texture of the crust (crunchy, crispy, chewy, ALWAYS) 3) Red sauce (savory, tangy, sweet, not overpowering)  I give the pizza 3 out of 5 stars all the way down. I would definitely go back for a slice or two. Does it compare to my NYC slice, or Pizza al metro in the alleys of Florence? Not up in here....NOT UP IN HEAYA!!"}
{"text":"I go here at least 3-4 times per month. Yeah, that's how good it is. Settebello will not let you down."}
{"text":"It's extremely hot in the place ! Only bad part! Every single worker is so attractive it hurts. The pizza is great the service is even better! Best place in town."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Pizza Bianca w/ arugula & proscuitto. This is the real deal Neopolitan style pizza, designated with the Vera Pizza Napoletana (VPN).    They don't slice them unless you request so, feel free to tear away pieces italian style instead!  If you're in the area, I suggest you stop in for a treat."}
{"text":"This place makes some great euro style pizza.  I highly recommend the antipasta app, great selection of meats and cheeses and hot bread.  The pizza was tasty but seemed really salty.  The crust was thinner than I like but seemed pretty authentic Italian.  The service was motivated and helpful, no issues there at all.  Not a fan of the tiny wine glasses, looked more like a juice glass than an alcoholic drink.    Solid choice for dinner but not my first choice in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I was told a pizza to go would take 10 mins, I have now been here half an hour and still no pizza, and I was told the just put it in the oven now. Trying to cover up and obvious case of a forgotten order."}
{"text":"Love this place. On Mondays  hang with Matt for $5 Margherita pizzas and great prices on an impressive bourbon selection!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best pizzas in Las Vegas. Due to the business ups and downs staffing could be an issue sometimes, but the wait is totally worth it !"}
{"text":"This place is a must for real Neapolitan Pizza.  We always go during happy hour (3-6 I believe) and get more then one kid size pizza . It's always good . My favorite is Vico, With onions sausage and fennel. Service is fast and everyone is super nice . There is also a map of Naples underground/ train service  by the bathroom, found that pretty cool."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked away in Whole Foods shopping center. You have to love Naples style pizza to really dig them. Middle of the road on price and great service the night we went.   Classy place that definitely deserves a visit!"}
{"text":"I struggled between giving this place 3 or 4 stars....the food was hands down a five star rating  Caprese salad was amazing ( wish it was bigger)  Margherita pizza on point  Pizza of the week solo carne well made...should be added to the menu permanently  If you like your crust more firm you should ask for it on the well done side  Service on the other hand... We were greeted by the most friendly hostess I've ever seen in a restaurant...she too deserves 5 stars They were busy but we were seated in less than 5 minutes  Our waitress was nice too just really busy and to be fair our experience didn't go south until the end...we finished our pizza and I wanted coffee and dessert. We ordered tiramisu and Nutella pizza and 2 cappuccinos...when waiting a very large party can in and they sat next to us...not really a big deal but we did have to move our table down a little for comfort. Our waitress was given the big table as well as needed to finish ours. We were delivered our desserts but coffees were no were to be found and she kept going back to the big table to take orders while we clearly sat at our table ready to go.she finally dropped the check with no mention of the coffee....until My husband mentioned it to her. She was nice and apologized but said well they aren't on the bill so that's good...yeah I guess it is good. I just felt like our table was no longer important now that a table of 25 was there...my bill was still $100 and I still tipped her 20% so I feel I was important too.  Just food for thought...and yes we will be back because the food is the bomb!"}
{"text":"There has been so much hype about this place, but I wasn't overly impressed.  There was nothing wrong with it - service was better than good, the place was clean, good menu selections, a little more money than I thought was going to be spending but that's ok.  I was just disappointed with the mediocrity of the pizza.  It's a fine place, but don't expect too much or it may disappoint."}
{"text":"Went to the Sahara location on a Friday at about 3p, only had dessert and a cafe americano, which was alright.  Just had to say, the service was ridiculously slow.  After waiting about 20 minutes without a return from the waitress, I got up to ask another waitress if I could get my check.  She said she would find my waitress, but that took another 10 minutes.  If it had been busy, I would have totally understood, but I could count the number of patrons on 2 hands, and there seemed to be 3 waitresses.  So in a nutshell, the service is pretty terrible. If you are expecting decent service, this is not the place."}
{"text":"This place is deeeelicious. I grew up in Southern Italy and this is the only pizza place in town that meets my standards for good Italian pizza. Our server was Austin and he did an awesome job. Super attentive and on top of things. This is one of our favorite places in town!"}
{"text":"Giving a 5 because 6 stars aren't available.  For 14 years I've tried to find a pizza like the ones I grew up eating back home in Italy. If you look at my other reviews you can tell I love pizza.  The search is over. The first bite sent me back memory lane and I thought I was back home for a second. Not to mention there is a pizzeria in my small hometown of Modugno with the same exact name!  The dough, the sauce, the mozzarella, all of it is top notch. Tried the arancini and a salad and they both didn't disappoint.  By the time I was leaving I was already planning my next visit."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Italian pizza.  It comes in one size which is six slices, plenty for sharing (with an appetizer to add) or large for personal pan for around $12-14. The wine and beer are also very fairly priced (the wine especially at about $6/glass regularly).  We had a pizza which came with sausage, mushrooms, pine nuts, and spinach.  Crust was great, the ingredients were great, but the cheese did fall off the pie rather easily.  The service was good and the environment was solid.  I would come back again for both the food and the price."}
{"text":"Solid pizza for under $15.  Quick service and consistent.  They do take out and also offer half/half pizzas if you want to try a couple of varieties.  Happy Hour is good for trying a few menu items, while Mondays are fantastic for $5 margarita pizzas.  In all, the food is high quality and the restaurant is quaint and casual with a seating area for a date night as well as a bar and TV area.  Easy parking and overall good scene make Settebello a nice option for pizza n the area"}
{"text":"Love the pizza but the chef's choice this week was lacking, would have been so much better with more berries and the caprese salad hardly had any basil and tiny tomatoes."}
{"text":"Like Pomo in Scottsdale, this place is simply awesome.  My family and I love napoletana style pizza.  Honestly, I don't know how anyone could not like it.  The crust is that perfect uneven crispiness on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside.  The tomato sauce on Settebello's pizza was particularly delicious and we loved the mozzarella di bufala on the pizza.  We also loved the $27/bottle Banfi cabernet/san giovese bottle of wine.  The atmosphere is fun and attractive.  Our waitress was delightful and helpful.  You can't go wrong here.  It's delicious."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!!!  I live on the Vegas Strip but it is so worth the drive down to Henderson for this pizza.  Their pizzas are all thin crust pizzas made in the traditional Napoli style and are utterly DELISH!  Each pizza is supposed to serve 1-2 persons depending on how hungry you are.  My husband and I split the lasagna pizza and the involtini di prosciutto as an appetizer.  Also, you must have the caramel & peanut butter gelatto confection for dessert.  First time in a long time that a dessert has left me at a loss for words.  He had the cannoli and it was perfectly creamy and crunchy and cinnamon-sugary...  wonderful."}
{"text":"Food was great, had the beet salad and goat cheese, loved the toasted almonds on the salad. We also tried the Margarita DOC pizza, super good a little soggy but all the flavors were there. We tried the panettone bread pudding it's super good. Ambiance was nice, will be back!"}
{"text":"great food, but limited menu with only pizza and salad. would be nice to have some type of chicken dish cooked in brick oven on the menu. the bar always seems to take a while for drinks and service can be hit or miss. they hire high school kids to serve and doesn't seem they get the best training. A lot of server/hostess gossip at the front desk - save your stories for when you are off. Even with the couple negatives I continue to eat here."}
{"text":"My favorite italian pizza in town! Great service and the authentic \"pizza napletana\" Must try:-)"}
{"text":"This is really REALLY good pizza!  It is different in that it is more European and rustic than the typical American sliced pizza.  The crust is different too.  It is really fluffy in the edges and the inside is really thin.  This makes eating it a little messy but totally worth it.  Their pizza is traditionally served unsliced and you eat it by tearing off little bits.  Good fun if you are having your own pizza.  If you are sharing or don't want to be a mess they will slice them up for you!  Here are some of the pizzas that I have tried so far: 1) Settebello: This is the name of the restaurant, how can you go wrong?  It has crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushroom, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil.  It is like an everything pizza.  So good.  If I had to choose one to be my favorite, this would be it. 2) Pizza Carbonara: Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, eggs, mozarella, pepper, olive oil.  The eggs are mixed in with the chesse.  This is another tomato sauce pizza that is really good. 3) Emilia (white pizza): Prosciutto, panna (cream), mozzarella, parmigiono reggiano, basil, olive oil.  Excellent and tasty white pizza.  The creamy consistency is delicious. 4) Vico (white pizza): Sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil.  The sausage and red onions on this pizza are delicious.  Basically all the pizzas are really good.  The bruschetta is good too but needed a little salt in my opinion.  For dessert the Bella Mella: apple with caramel, vanilla mascarpone, and almonds was the best.  We tried the nutella pizza (so-so) and the nutella filled donuts.  The apple pie was the best by far.  Come here for some great pizza and a food coma shortly to follow.  I fell asleep right after and didn't wake up to brush my teeth or shower until 6am.  It is powerful pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks! One of the best pizzas I've ever had. The staff is all very knowledgable of the menu which is a plus and I believe all their ingredients are imported!!"}
{"text":"Great Napoli style pizza- friendly service - very clean restaurant with pleasant atmosphere.  Mi piace molto!"}
{"text":"Just excellent, top quality, delicious, Italian food. I'll let the other 100+ reviews speak for themselves, just wanted to put my 5 stars in."}
{"text":"After reading reviews I couldn't wait to try this place. I ordered the beet salad and the santebello pizza. The salad was good. But the pizza was what I was really looking forward to! And I will say I was alittle let down. I didn't really love the flavors of this pizza."}
{"text":"First time at Settebello's and we happened to make it in during happy hour. Had the Mini Ripieno and Spiedini off the HH menu and also the brisket pizza. All the food was great except the brisket tasted like Philly cheesesteak which was okay.   The great staff has me writing the review. Our server was Vanessa. She informed us about happy hour and checked back frequently to make sure everything was good. The hostess and food runner/buzzer were also very attentive to us. Great staff! Will be back just for the service quality."}
{"text":"I was not expecting quality Italian pizza in the middle of a desert. This pizza is fantastic! I like the Margherita DOC because it comes with imported mozzarella, fresh basil and crushed tomatoes versus the standard Margherita."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian pizza. I love the margarita pizza, thin chewy crust- fresh and full of flavor. The salads are simple and tasty as well."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this place is so adorable. Super New York vibe. If you call 24 hours ahead they will make you a gluten free crust. This I found very interesting. Because the dough is made from scratch and it has to rise over night, can we say FRESH! so awesome. Since we didnt call ahead we decided to just stick with a salad. I had the Insalata Grande. Only 8 dollars it consisted of Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano, and tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. I also had an espresso martini. WOW i could drink 10 of them. and made with illy coffee? yes please! Ill def be returning here, and next time ill call ahead for a gluten free pizza :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Summerlin. Andy and I come here often and have loved each expedience.  Located in the Village Square shopping center right by the movie theater, there is tons of parking so its very convenient. We have tried various items here but our favorites have been their Italian Panini (not on the menu but ask your server/bartender about it) Its huge so I suggest sharing it! Also when were in the mood for pizza we get the Diavola, Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. AMAZING! it has a kick so its not for those who dont like spice. Josh the GM is great. He makes our dining exp so much more enjoyable then anywhere else we frequent. I highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Hmmm this place is ok. We came in for happy hour to check the place out. I've had the pizza once a long time ago for takeout, but had yet to eat inside. (I'm a Grimaldi's girl)   We started with the meat & cheese plate. The bf got all the meat because it was all pork. The cheese was very limited (two kinds mozzarella & something else) they were ok but I expected a little more selection or quantity. The bread was good though & the the bf liked the pork.   Bf ordered the HH *  basically a small calzone. I ordered the hh margherita pizza. Both were good and worthy of their $5 price tag.  We also ordered the *at our servers request. He reminded us to remove the cotta (pork) so we subbed it for pine nuts. The pizza was good & flavorful,  but both pizzas were a little soggy in the middle... Not sure if this is just the Napoletana way... But it's not my preference. However folding the pizza in half like a taco makes for easier eating.   The HH Pinot Noir was quite good, very subtle. Suicide was pretty good. Friendly & attentive. There wasn't much action on the patio but for the most part he stayed on top of things."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients and a wood-burning stove make the pizza sold here delicious at reasonable prices! There are all different flavor combinations. My personal favorites are the Bianca pizza which is prosciutto and mozzarella, and the Quattro Formaggi which is a mix of fontina, gorgonzola, mozzarella, and parmesan. The focaccia is something I always order as well.  The ambience of the restaurant serves many purposes. You can easily celebrate a special event here, or stop by for lunch or dinner. The dining area has a nice ambience, and feels homey. It is clean and the service is attentive and professional. You get all this, but the prices are reasonable, so it doesn't break the bank.  The dining area isn't large, so if you have a large party, call in advance to make sure you can be accommodated, the tables can be moved together, but you will still be limited. Of all the pizza places this one is in my top five favorites."}
{"text":"Our Italian friend, Filippo, highly recommended this place. Service is awesome especially Chris who took the time explaining the entire menu to us. We had the settebello pizza, bruschetta, and the meatballs. Wow, amazing flavors with fresh ingredients. No need for salt and pepper folks. We also had the Nutella filled zeppole and let me tell you... the hint of lemon is quite clever to cut the sweetness. You have to come to this place. Thank you Filippo"}
{"text":"This is tough one... I ordered the margarita pizza. The pizza is cooked perfectly. Not burnt, the sauce is very tasty, the dough and other ingredients fresh. However, there is a very strong and distinct smokey wood after taste on the pizza. I'm wondering if it is because we are here right when they opened and maybe the ovens are still smokey. Bottom line I don't like that smokey taste on any thing let alone my pizza. Because of this, unfortunately I have to rate this pizza a 3 stars. Btw the service was good, we did not wait long either so this review is based strictly on my dislike for smokey tasting food. My girlfriends loved her pizza smoke and all! For an Italian New Yorker this just not my preferred pizza sorry!"}
{"text":"True Napolitan pizza with great taste, chew and fair pricing.  We started our dinner with the Romano salad which was dressed nicely and tasted great!  One order was enough for 4 adults to share.  We then had 3 pizzas (Margherita, Settebello, and Bianco).  All were delicious having their own individual tastes.  The crust/dough was consistent and tasty on their own!  This will definitely be a place we plan to visit when we are in LA!"}
{"text":"One of our families favorites! Always friendly, always good! Natalia and her team are top notch. My husband is a big fan of the Cinnamon gelato and if we let her know we coming in, Natalia makes sure it's there. Some of our favorites are the Misto, Beet Salad, Emilia... There's too many to list."}
{"text":"Tried margherita pizza last night - I like woody smokiness of the crust but sauce, mozzarella cheese , and basil were not very flavorful. I'm not sure how you screw up a simple pizza like this. This is a second trip there and I find it disappointing. Ambience is good."}
{"text":"Awesome pizzeria. The bread is fantastic. Nice and calm atmosphere. But the ice though... SO GREAT!"}
{"text":"i am in love with this place. the bianca pizza is my favorite by far! an italian man taught me to sprinkle it with a little fresh lemon juice and some salt...it really made it even better!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Settebello.  The new location is super close to home.  The only drawback is I always end up spending too much money on dinner, but it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved the selection of Italian beer. 2 for 1 at happy hour too.  The pizza was good but not mind blowing or anything.  I tried the Vico and the Settebello. The nutella pizza was also very good.  Definitely a cool little place I would go to again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Josh in fantastic. He took care of my husband and I for the evening, and everything he brought to the table was spot on. He was knowledgeable and passionate, and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening.  For starters my husband and I had a platter with toasted bread, prosciutto, mozzarella buffalo, and tomatoes in basil. We topped one topping on the next, and it was to die for. It wasn't even on the menu, so I can't remember what it is called!  My husband had an Old Fashioned and he said it was the best one of his life.  Next, we both dove into some pies. My husband got the diavvolo (spelling?) and I got a pizza with artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, and salami. Both pizzas were incredible, but my husband's was spicier and more full of flavor. The crust is thin, doughy in the center, and the crust dipped into the red pepper olive oil is the best thing in the whole world.  For dessert, I had the traditional tiramisu, and my husband tried the strawberry and crema dessert. Both were heavenly.   We asked Josh throughout the meal to pair up our food with adult beverages, and each time he was spot on.  We cannot wait to go back! The best pizza in town. In fact, my husband said the pizza was better than when he was in Italy.  Well done, Settebello!"}
{"text":"After much anticipation and plenty of procrastination, I have finally gotten around to trying out Setebello after my girlfriend and I decided we were craving pizza. If you come here expecting a big, greasy chicago style deep dish however, you will be disappointed (and stupid, for not reading the title of the restaurant). They only do authentic Neapolitan pizza here and that is what you will get. If you are open minded to this drastically different definition of pizza however, you will fall in love.   It's cozy inside. There are a couple of non-descript italian themed decorations, a modest bar and a fire oven conspicuously  located in the middle of the establishment. If you go in the evening there's bound to be a wait but trust me when I say it's worth it. We were eventually seated and our friendly waiter was happy to explain the quality of the ingredients, the serving size, and a number of other questions a foodie like myself would normally ask during a first time dining experience.   A single pizza tends to serve one average appetite, or two small appetites (with the addition of an antipasti). My girlfriend chose the spicy Diavola and I went with the popular Capricciosa. They were simply heavenly. My pizza was delicately covered in artichoke, roasted peppers, succulent olives, and fresh basil which added perfect flavor to the mouth watering cheese over their fresh crushed tomatoes. Believe me when I say you can taste the difference between these quality ingredients and the crap you can buy at a major corporate pizza joint.   It's surprisingly thin and light-- many people eat it with a knife and fork and you can always request to have it served sliced if you wish. It's perfect if you aren't in the mood for excessive carbs or fats but still want a satisfying meal. I had no problem finishing the whole thing and could have easily eaten the other half of my girlfriends pizza but she insisted on saving it for later :P  I have had Neapolitan style pizza before and my girlfriend has had the stuff in authentic eateries in Italy. Both of us concluded that this was, without question, the best pizza we have ever tasted. This has instantly become one of my favorite spots and I guarantee I will be back here several times over the next few months. If you are in the Henderson area and you have not tried Setebello, you have NO excuse not to come here. Hell, if you're lactose intolerant pop a lactase pill and join in on the fun-- I firmly believe all residents of the area owe it to themselves to experience this place."}
{"text":"thank you Yelp! for telling me about Settebello...  its actually pretty embarrassing...  ive been staying at Green Valley since they opened...  really the only place i stay when i go to Vegas which is pretty frequently.  anyway...  enough of that.  just flat out delicious pizza...  an epiphany in a sense.  the dough, the sauce, the cheese...  it all just sings a beautiful italian harmony.  let me put it this way, my sister and i shared the Capricciosa, and after my first slice, i was actually taking the toppings off and eating separately because i wanted to eat the true essence of the pizza.  after this experience, i can now see why the \"true\" Napoli pizza is the Margherita, its all you really need.  maybe the Quattro Formaggi will figure in there on the next visit (believe me, there will be a next visit), but thats it.  other foods ordered included the Pizza Lasagna (also delicious) by a friend who met my family for lunch, the Quattro Stagioni shared by my parents, and for appetizers the Caprese (ridunkulous), the Involtini di Prosciutto (heavenly) and the Misto (decadent).  really, if you are a lover of pure italian cuisine + crazy fresh ingredients of the utmost quality, you must try Settebello.  but do yourself a favor...  stick to the basic Margherita, have an order of Involtini di Prosciutto to start, and share a Misto plate for your cured meat kick.  when the separate elements are this divine on their own you begin to understand why pure italian cuisine is so refreshingly simple, yet wonderful."}
{"text":"After spending the summer in Italy this is the closest pizza I found in all Vegas. Nice wood fired thin crust pizza. The fresh mozzarella was melted to perfection. The sauce had just enough hint of sweetness to it. Being from New York I know my pizza. You will not be disappointed with Settebello! Very friendly and courteous staff!!  Can't wait to visit again!!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Naples Italy. I can tell you Settebello is as good or better than the pizza masters in Napoli. I highly recommend this the Diavola."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian pizza, thoughtful selection of craft beer and friendly, helpful staff. A shout out to Patrick."}
{"text":"We ordered two pizzas and neither were spectacular. I had the Settebello and everything kept running off of the pizza because the crust was so soft. Usually I prefer a sturdy crust. I will go back to try it again but my first impression wasn't great."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places for Pizza in Las Vegas. However, it tends to be a hit or miss with the service, they are constantly short staffed and the servers approach is nothing special. Anyways, I'm always back for their delicious pizzas."}
{"text":"Life changing pizza. You cannot afford to miss this food. Miles beyond above anything else, nothing even remotely compares. I've been coming here since they opened in Green Valley, and have never been disappointed in the hundreds of margarita/garlic/salami pizzas I have devoured. Each better than the last. A+++."}
{"text":"I like many, love Pizza. So much i have spent years trying everything and spent years making my own. I prefer traditional, crispy thin crust pizzas.  So Setabello Pros: great location, nice atomsphere, menu and  awesome ingredients.                          Cons: execution and staff.  They have teens making these pizzas everytime I have gone. I get soggy pizza (with great toppings)  and a  burnt crust which is detreminal if it's too much which it has been 90% of the time.  Great flavors with their quality ingredients, but not so great texture and defintiely not what i consider traditional.   worth a try, but not the best."}
{"text":"Good food, but the booths are disgusting.  The manager is a slacker bc he/she doesn't make employees clean or disinfect the seating areas.  Makes me wonder about the kitchen?"}
{"text":"Returned to this pizzeria with family and no balsamic vinegar on salads just oil. Pizza was soggy and burnt on the bottom. Told their was a wait over the phone and it was not crowded for a Saturday night.  Very disappointed won't be back. They aren't consistent. Returned after all and had sattelbello pizza and salad everything was fine."}
{"text":"Ordered 2  pizzas and cheese platter. The pizzas looked like mini pools . Tomatoes drowned the cheese and meats . The crust was so soggy. Cheese platter came so late is was covered by the place .  5 of us left hungry and  short of $40.00 GG. If you come here hungry don't expect to leave satisfied. Gotta go to In n Out now to fulfill our hunger"}
{"text":"I really do love this place. They use Italien 00 flour just like in Italy for their pizzas. It's thin and crunchy, one of the only 2 places in town I get a good pizza. Keep going I love it. It's always busy and we always got lucky getting a table with 5 people. Had Bruschetta and Salad there also and both tasted really good."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.  The hostess said the wait would be 30 minutes. After 40 minutes I decided to check on how many people were left ahead of us. My group didn't want to wait much longer. The hostess looked up my name and said two tables in front of us. 25 more minutes go by and I see three more groups seated.  Go check to see why we were skipped and then told there are FIVE more in front of you.  I explained what the other hostess told me.  No apology. Just a shoulder shrug. So the originally quoted 30 minute wait, would've been at least an hour and a half if we kept waiting.  I gave up just after an hour. Had I been told the truth of 8(!) more tables in front of us I would've only wasted half the time.  Either the hostesses intentionally lie or they can't count or estimate."}
{"text":"Super good! The Diavola was delicious. The atmohsphere is really nice too and the price wasn't too bad either (compared to similar places like CPK). Will definitely go there again! I would say the only downfall was our waiter didn't come very often, but whatever, I enjoyed the pizza too much to care :)"}
{"text":"Truly a different type of pizza. I really enjoyed the crust and the toppings were fresh and of high quality. We ordered the Settabello pizza and were pleased. I can't say anything bad about the pizza but I think I enjoy a New York style pizza more.   My only complaint about this pizza place was the lack of customer service. With this being our first visit to this restaurant, it would have been nice for our waitress to be able to explain the menu or how things worked. When we asked questions, we were met with short responses and our waitress made us feel like we were wasting her time. We truly did not feel welcome as customers.   Overall, if you're a fan of this type of pizza, you will enjoy the food. If you know exactly what you want and don't want to interrupt the waitresses day (EVEN THOUGH THAT'S HER JOB), you might really like this place. But if you are new to the style and this type of pie, try another place. One with employees who value their customers."}
{"text":"It's hard to give a 5 star rating to an establishment.  Everything has to be inline and perfect.  From the food, to the service, to the cleanliness...it all has to work.  Settebello definitely falls into this category!  Being a pizza snob from NYC, it would take a lot for me to give a 5 star rating for pizza other then NY style pizza.  I do not recognize Chicago sytle pizza as pizza. It's more lasagna than Pizza.  I never loved Napoletana pizza either.  It's sauce on cracker thin dough, more on the torilla chip side with salsa than anything else.  The only pizza for me is NYC style pizza!  Thin, greasy, crispy bottom and crust with gooey cheese.  Settebello's Napoletana pizza changed all that for me!  First off, the Service and cleanliness was great.  Everyone was very helpful and anticipated our needs.  They were great!  The decor is great and it's a great date place as well as a wonderful family restaurant.  Now on to the food review.  My wife ordered the Mahagarita and I ordered it also with prosciutto.  The Pizza was PERFECT!  The dough was fresh and soft, with a hint of crisp burnt taste from the oven.  Each bite transcended the experience.  You can almost taste the history and love (that's right, I said love) that was put into the pizza for hundreds of years.  From the first person to make a pizza in Italy hundreds of years ago, to that day as it sat on my plate.  This morsel of time was a \"foodgasim\" that lasted from a single bite.  This is just from the pizza dough.  The sauce was tangy with the a tickle of sweetness.  The prosciutto gave it a wonderfuly salty balance.  The cheese was cooked perfect with the hint of the fresh basil giving the perfect aromatic kiss at the end.  It was like the first drop of morning dew, dripping off the left.  Splashing down on the ground, giving life to those around it, unassuming and perfect; as nature intended.   After I wiped away a tear from my eye from this uplifting experience, we ordered the Nutella/Banana Pizza desert.  I'm not a big Nutella fan, but once again the dough was spiritual and made me a fan.  Overall, the 2 pizza's, 2 iced teas and Desert Pizza was $37. Not cheap by any means, but well worth the price.  I highly recommend Settebello's and will be frequent this pizzeria very often."}
{"text":"Settebello, you let me down! There was one item that I had every intention of ordering and it wasn't there. That item was a budino, an Italian pudding-like dessert. It's simple, but when done right it'll make you wonder why you haven't had it sooner.  Of course, Settebello is know for their pizza rather than desserts so I had to try one. I opted for the self-titled pie the Settebello ($13.50) with crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and evoo. The interplay of savoriness and saltiness made for excellent flavors and the pine nuts added a crunchy texture that elevated the rest of the dish. My biggest complaint was the paper thin crust under the pie. I understand the Napoli-style makes for a wet pizza with a soft, pliable crust, but the lack of density beneath all the ingredients made it appear soupy. A good pizza for sure, but my personal preference is for a firmer crust.  Without the budino, I decided to try two desserts. First up was the Dream Bomba ($5), a dense ball of caramel surrounded by a creamy and smooth peanut butter gelato and coated in chocolate. It was cut into four wedges. A solid dessert for sure, and one that you'll want to share.  The second almost made me forget why I came here in the first place. The zeppole ($5.50) were soft, warm pillowy mini doughnuts of deliciousness filled with plenty of nutella. Coated with plenty of sugar, it's a sure-fire cure for any sweet tooth. If you're sharing with a kid, like I was, make sure you get extra napkins because most of the sugar and nutella ended up all over his face.  While not quite living up to the lofty expectations I had, Settebello is a great family-friendly dining option, especially if you're craving pizza Napoletana."}
{"text":"Feeling like pizza, I called in a order for pick-up. The girl who took my order was friendly and said my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I headed over and upon walking in I was quickly greeted by the hostess who rang me up and asked if I needed any crushed red pepper or parmesan cheese added to my pizza box. I sat only for a couple minutes before my pizza was brought out. The inside looks very clean, but I was glad I placed my order for pick-up because it looked too trendy to be eating pizza in there. The hostess opened my pizza box and went over my order and asked if it was to my liking. It looked good!  Priced at $13.50 I had the \"Margherita DOC\" and the pizzas seem to come in one size here. It is more of a personal size pizza, but not super tiny. I was happy with it and couldn't finish the last 2 pieces. The pizza has crushed tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. The crust was light and crispy, while the center of the pizza was softer. I had trouble picking up the pizza and eating it so I used a fork and knife which I don't mind. The crushed tomato sauce tasted sweet. I loved the amount of fresh mozzarella that was on it too! I'd like to try some of their other pizzas so I will be back. They also have some salads that sounds good!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for a few years now. They have the best pizza in town as far as I am concerned. It's clean, the food is good and the service is fantastic.  My favorite is theie margherita pizza  Along with their tomato  mozzarella salad.  Everything taste fresh looks fresh convenient parking if I could give them 10 stars I would."}
{"text":"Wow! Staff was excellent! Food was great! The Corvo Pinot Noir was very good. We shared a Insalata Grande salad that was really good. The Settebello pizza was also great. Wanted to take home leftovers, but it was so good we couldn't stop eating. Tira misu for dessert was perfect!"}
{"text":"Excellent Neapolitan style pizza and excellent service.  This restaurant is large, airy, clean and welcoming.  Recommend highly."}
{"text":"In town for my birthday and to visit family and am so happy I was able to find this place. I ordered the Margarita DOC a glass of Pinot Noir and tiramisu of dessert. Everything was so fresh and delicious!  I will absolutely recommend this place to anyone wanting an outstanding authentic brick oven pizza!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had lunch here not too long ago and I actually was very satisfy with the pizzas. During lunch, they offer 8-inch personal pizza instead of the regular 12-inch pizzas, for a few bucks less.  We shared the carbonara and margherita doc.  Both were very delicious.    Service was quick.  After our lunch, we walked over to Whole Foods to shop for our dinner items."}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner from start to finish ! We had Mitchell as our server and he was great , very attentive and just an all around pleasant person . The food was amazing , my son loves the dessert pizza with Nutella!! Will definitely go back again soon !"}
{"text":"Not a good experience.  You know you're in trouble when you walk in to a place and you're greeted by three different people who offer to help you but then none of them do. All I wanted to do was pick up my takeout; 2 pies and a salad. I gave my card to one girl who stood with my credit card 5 feet away from me complaining to another employee about a previous customer for 3 minutes while I watched her not running my card and not getting my food.   After finally handing over my food, I was asked if I wanted parmesan cheese and red peppers. You could have asked this before you went to get the food so you could have grabbed everything at once making my wait less but yes I do. Hot damn! Apparently those toppings are in short supply because I was given two packets of peppers and 1 ramekin of cheese that was so empty I could count the flakes. $39 bucks and I can't even have half a ramekin?  Okay, well the front of house sucked but how about those delicious pies I've been reading about?  I got home with our pizzas and salad and without saying a word to my wife she took a bite and said, \"these aren't cooked all the way.\" Sure weren't. I knew this because I had to sneak a piece on the way home (to test things out as any good husband would do) and had the luxury of eating cheese that wasn't quite melted.   On to the \"bread\" salad. There were two croutons in it. It was a sea of arugula.   Back of house fail.   Not sure what is going on with this place. It has all the elements of a good restaurant but the execution is way off. Whoever owns this place needs to step in quickly because the staff are not trained well and it shows.   With so many pizza options, don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and amazing service! I went here with a large group and the staff was very accommodating. I ordered the Emilia and it was AMAZING! The meat, cheese, and thin crust worked perfectly together. You can eat one pizza for yourself but if you want you can share with others! I love coming here because of the great pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. The carbonara pizza was a bit disappointing on the flavor end but the pear/jalapeño pizza was outstanding. Apparently, that flavor is specific to the Henderson location as one of their employees created it. The rucola salad was fresh and flavorful. Definitely get the shaved parmesan on it."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the pizza here. My favorites are the Capricciosa and Margherita DOC. Their crust is thin which I like but sometimes can be flimsy and moist. Their ingredients are always fresh and they aren't stingy with their toppings. I just wish their cannoli's didn't have the added zest flavor. The zest kind of ruined the flavor of the cannoli cream for me. The staff is always incredibly friendly and professional. Overall, if you enjoy thing crust pizza and fresh ingredients, you cannot go wrong with Settebello."}
{"text":"The Henderson location has been my favorite pizza place since I came to town, but it was a sometime visit because of the distance from home.  Sooo glad to have the new one on the west side.  Pizza seemed underdone which I hope is just part of the breaking-in process.  The physical restaurant is very attractive and should become a local hotspot.  Viva Settebello!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. We shared a pizza and a panini. Loved the pizza and the sandwich was good too. Came with a side salad that I really liked.   The service could have been better. Not many people there yet we waited to be seated and served and then for the bill and such.  One really bad note for the manager. When the waitress was bringing the food out she stopped the waitress and grabbed the plate then took it in the back. Then it was delivered. Well of course we asked why. Our waitress explained that it  was because there was too much salad for the side salad.  What could a pinch of extra greens in the salad cost??? A nickel???  My food gets yanked out of the servers hands right in front of us and stalked back into the kitchen for a nickel.   Well that nickels worth of greens left a bad taste in my mouth and lowered the rating."}
{"text":"Delicious food, flavorful cocktails and a nice happy hour menu but service lacked.   We grabbed a couple chairs in the bar area before heading over to see a movie and made it in time for their happy hour which is from 3-6pm. We were a group of 12 women but we came in groups of four with 20 minute increments in between our arrivals.  We ordered a few personal pizzas, an artichoke crostini and a couple craft cocktails including a mint Collins, basil gimlet and Moscow mule that were each $5. They have a wide variety on their happy hour menu with lots of different choices.   Everything we drank and ate was awesome. The char on the pizza crust that they get from the wood fired oven was perfect. Chewy texture with a little crunch on their crust. The artichoke crostini had slices of prosciutto, large pieces of marinated artichoke and and ricotta. You can't beat the price on the craft cocktails either!   Service was incredibly slow, the waitress was overwhelmed when our group came in and never wrote anything down. She would then come back and ask what we ordered every time she took an order. At one point two girls spoke up and she snapped back, you both can't talk to me I can only handle one person at a time. She clearly needed help but no one else came to assist her. Next time write things down. One of my friends waited 20 minutes for a water! Cocktails and food all came at different times even when orders were given to her at the same time.   I'm giving it four stars instead of two or three because the food and drinks were good."}
{"text":"Amazing. Very satisfied. If you don't try this pizza it's your loss.   Its light pizza, not greasy, just perfect!"}
{"text":"It's great service.  Just not my type of pizza.  Try for yourself, you may like.  My niece who's 18 loved it."}
{"text":"Truly authentic!! I've been to Italy several times and fell in love with \"REAL\" pizza. Settebello is like being in Italy without taking the plane ride. The ingredients are so fresh!  I would recommend everyone try this stlye of pizza, you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"VPN-Vero Pizza Napoletana,,,,,Thats what sets Settebello apart from all the other pizzerias in town. It is the stamp of approval given by the pizza making authority in Italy, and only a handful of establishments in the U.S. have been given this distinction, so if you come across any of these establishments sporting the VPN signage on their front door, you know its the real deal like you would find in Naples, All you pizza snobs stop comparing it to NY or Chicago style, because it doesn't even compare! They're trying to keep tradition and integrity by following the traditional pizza making ways as they do IN NAPLES! If you want Pepperoni or Pineapple, CALL DOMINOS!!!  Okay, done with my rant...on to my review. Been going to Settebellos ever since they were first located on Valle Verde and Horizon Ridge. It was hidden away and not too many people knew about this place until they made the move to The District. The ingredients are top-notch, and ALL their pizzas are the BOMB! I've tried everything- Margherita, Carbonara, Ripieno, etc. and my favorite, The Settebello. The ONLY way to devour all this goodness is the minute it is placed in front of you and there's no better way to finish with an Affogatto,Double espresso with a scoop of gelato. Looking forward to return again soon,,,ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA. The price was good for the size of pizza they brought out. I had never heard of egg on pizza before and was a little hesitant to try it, but it was delish. The place has good service. The pizzas came out within 10-15 minutes which was reasonable considering how good the pizza was. I'm definitely bringing my family the next time I come here."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a restaurant that follows the true Naples (Napoli) tradition of pizza making for quite a while.  In my journey I've discovered that it really comes down to the quality of ingredients, coupled with an oven that is made of the right materials, and is heated in a proper way.  I'm happy to say that Settebello has NAILED it.  Their pizza is as close to a true Neapolitan pizza as you can get, short of traveling to Naples itself.  Slightly crispy on the bottom, soft on the top, and chewy delicious.  The authentic flavor of tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, olive oil and basil - it doesn't get any better.  The owner went out of his way to bring you a true taste from the birthplace of pizza, and it shows.  Though they offer more styles of pizza than what is traditionally available (to suit the expectations of an American market probably), they do it within reason, and they keep it delicious.  Literally everything we had there was great, from the prosciutto, to the caprese, to the absolutely perfect margherita pizza.  If you want that Naples authentic pizza without having to travel to Italy, this is as close as you can get.  Pro tip - stick to the marinara or margherita pizza if you want a true taste of Naples.... and for the love of all things holy, get the basil-wrapped prosciutto drizzled with their house balsamic.  You will cry tears of joy."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars is more accurate.      I was searching for authentic Neapolitan pizza near LV.  This is it!        The decor is chic and modern and the food was delicious and satisfying.      The bummer:  the waitress and entry phase.  We had to flag her several times and it seems we were bothering her.  The place was not crowded at the time(4 in the afternoon).  Also we had our children with us and they didn't offer crayons or a kids' menu at the beginning of the experience. How do I know they have those items?  We saw them at the entry podium.      There needs to be a refresher course on customer service for the serving staff."}
{"text":"I came into this pizzeria for lunch with my best friend. Service was speedy & excellent. We both had the lunch special which was a margarita pizza & a panzanella salad. both were extremely delish! Price is super reasonable- the meal was around $12. they do free birthday desserts! we both decided that we would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Settebello is my fav pizza place in town. No wonder this place has been posted on Seven and Vegas weekly so many times. It is truly a local gem place. Atmosphere here is very casual with a full bar serving by the side. All their ingredients are imported from Italy (flours, olive oil, cheese, tomato, Prosciutto Cott...) I pretty much tried everything on menu already. Everything tastes good. Here are my fav: 1.) Settebello pizza, 2.)Capriccios pizza,3.) Bianc pizza, 4.) Insalata Grand salad, 5.) Caprese, 6.) Panna Cotta   Also, they do have happy hours. All small bites are $5 each with half priced selected cocktails and beers."}
{"text":"My daughter loves pizza. We usually just have it delivered but it's her birthday. Pizza was yummy and the service was excellent.  Free birthday dessert."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great service! A friend of mine recommended me to go to this place for the quality of its Napolitano style pizzas and he was right, it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Most amazing pizza I've ever had. Hands down.  Sooo for my birthday this past weekend, visiting from CA, I wanted to try a new place I have never had before. Settebello's Pizza came up during my search, and I figured why not? Who doesn't love a good pizza. I just didn't expect it to be as amazing as it was!  We get to the Henderson location and walk in. We weren't greeted by the hostess, who was just standing there. So my sister walks up and asks if we can have a table for 3. The hostess was like \"oh well I don't have a table right now so you can just check in the bar area.\" Uh....ok?! Thanks for the great customer service. No hi or how are you guys doing? Must have been having an awful night.  So we went and sat at the bar and the bartender's customer service completely made up for her lack of enthusiasm. Cute guy, slicked back hair and glasses....I can't remember his name. Asked if we had ever been there before and we told him we hadn't. He gave us a bunch of suggestions and told us his favorite pizza to eat and told us if we had any questions to just let him know. Well, I had lots of questions. Seems silly but their menus are hard to understand with ingredients that must be in Italian. I was like what's this? and this? and this? The bartender was so patient. My fiancé was starting to get irritated but I didn't want to order something weird lol. We ended up just telling him what kind of toppings we wanted and he made it happen. Amazing food and good customer service so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great but I hate how fast it gets cold..... My girl loves it!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Gets cold fast but thats when you will enjoy it the most. 5 Stars for the quality of food. Service and beverage selection probably a 4 star. You guys get a 5 star from me!"}
{"text":"I love this place! To get my husband to eat vegetables on a regular basis is a whole ordeal, but he actually enjoys their beet and arugula salad without a fight!! Seriously, even if you think you hate beets, you won't after you try this here! Of course Settebellos is known for its  Neapolitan style pizzas and every one we've had has been excellent. There's one topped with a mouthwatering peppery brisket, many topped with Italian meats and cheeses, others cater to a more vegetarian palate. Just remember to pair your meals with a cold fine glass of Prosecco or an Italian birra, followed with a scoop of Rum raisin gelato or a slice of their unforgettable Tiramisu! Oh boy I'm getting HUNGRY just writing about it!!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: A Food:        A Service:    D-  If you are looking for one tasty pizza Settobello just may be your place.  I dined here for the second time this past weekend and once again, while the food was superb the service is UTTERLY LACKING (which can ruin an otherwise great mean in my book.)  Myself and five friends gathered for a post-New Year's dinner.  We gave the server our entire order and our waters and iced teas made their way to the table.  About this time the fire alarm went off... and continued to go off.  Finally they asked everyone inside the restaurant to wait outside while they investigated further (kudos to them... I loved that they took this seriously and put guest safety first.)  After about 15 minutes out in the cold Las Vegas night we were allowed to come back inside.  The server came back to the table and basically said, \"I can't find your order and will need to put it back into the computer.\"  Umm, okay, no big deal.  Though we found it strange that no one ever came by to address the fire alarm or simply say \"thanks so much for waiting outside, we know it's cold and really appreciate it\" or \"hey, it was a false alarm, fire department came and checked everything out... thanks for waiting.\"  No, it was simply business as usual without one word about the incident.  A few minutes 5 of us receive our food... the 6th persons order is lost.  Again, no big deal since we have ordered a ton of food and we all prefer family style anyway.  About a quarter of the way through our meal one of the servers is trying to stock the shelf LOCATED ABOUT 2 INCHES from three of my friends (on the opposite side of the table) and continually asks my friends to please move so she can complete her side-work.  This is where they completely lose me.  Here we are, trying to enjoy our meal and we are being asked to constantly move/stand-up/shuffle our chairs so the server can complete her re-stocking of pizza boxes behind us???  We then ask for refills on all six of our drinks since NO ONE has re-addressed this since we originally sat down - and what really infuriated me the most about this particular incident is that there were SIX employees standing at the POS terminal chatting to one another!  I'm sorry, but as a manager I'm like HELL NO!  Either get to work or go home!!    In the end we paid our bill and gave 20% tip because our original server was somewhat decent.  But we did ask to speak to the General Manager about the evening.  A lady greeted us a few minutes later... we told our story and she said \"I completely understand and I would feel the same way, but I'm just the bar manager......\"  In a nutshell, Settebello PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE focus on training and management of your employees.  You serve a fantastic pizza but this was my second experience at your restaurant and both times the service has really let me down (the first time wasn't much better but I was willing to give a second try.)"}
{"text":"I was schooled in the tradition of Neopolitan style pizza. I came here on a recommendation and was definitely impressed with the quality of ingredients and  strict adherence to traditional standards required. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here with friends and we all were of the opinion that this place was great.  We started with the Misto plate, which was great.  It was a generous helping of cured meats, cheese, olives and focaccia.  Next time I will likely make a meal out of this appetizer alone.  We all had pizza and they were also very tasty.  All of the ingredients seemed fresh and simply prepared.  I had the settebello pizza which had great flavor, the crust had great texture and I do not remember the center of the pizza being too soggy as is common with other Napoleon style pizza places.  At the end of the meal I tried the panna cotta, which was very good and had a healthy amount of strawberries and sauce.  Over all this meal was great, all of the food was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for pizza! Great for date night every time.   Ask for Patric, he is my favorite and I ask for him every time. Never let down by his service and the amazing food and drink menu.   I recommend the Misto, and the Margarita Pizza  And for a drink the Soreno is hands down amazing."}
{"text":"Mariana is absolutely fantastic. She's the true definition of service. I will return just to see her. Wonderful service and food"}
{"text":"I had always passed this little cute pizzeria place when I would head to whole foods. This place is great! I had traveled to Italy in July 2013 and we stayed in Rome. The first thing that I wanted to try was the pizza and pasta of course! It was just divine. The Italians use fresh ingredients and the brick oven was the key! Settebello brought me back to Italy. I was a little skeptic because I really wanted some good pizza. My brother and a friend accompanied me on my birthday. We got our drinks right away when we were seated which is a plus for me. The waiter gave us a little more time to look at the menu because it was my first time. It was fun trying to pronounce the words but the had things that I recognized like the caprese or the cheese platter, and the meat platter which I must go back for. We settled for the carbonara pizza and the settebello. I loved that you could see the brick oven and let me tell you, when a pizza is made in a brick oven you won't be able to eat regular pizza again! The food came out and we dug in right away. The ingredients were so fresh, you could taste the basil and the herbs that were on the settebello, the yummy sausage and the mushrooms. The cheese and sauce just looked so authentic. The way they scrambled the egg on the carbonara was perfect, the flavors were bold and tasty. I really recommend anyone looking for a place to try authentic Italian pizza to try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is super underrated. I have been here multiple times, and have always left very satisfied. The last two times I have come have been for Happy Hour. They have an amazing Happy Hour here which includes really good discounts on cocktails and drinks, $5 mini pizzas, appetizers, and desserts.   Their pizza is very flavorful, and the crust here is soft, lightly toasted, and has a slight smoky flavor from the wood fire oven. For their pizzas, I love their Emilio, Vico, and Diavola Pizza. The Emilio and Vico are both a creamy sauce pizza, and the Diavola comes with a spicy tomato sauce. Their Prosciutto Crostini was very tasty as well. It comes topped with generous Proscuitto and parmigiano-reggiano.    I loved their Tequila Mockingbird cocktail, and it's unlike any other cocktail I've had before.   Overall, great pizza place and happy hour spot."}
{"text":"WOW.. you thought you loved pizza before?  Head on down to Settebello and be blown away!  The pizza here was amazing and tasted so freakin' good.  My buddy Wayne C. showed me Settebello and explained to me the story behind their pizza making and how their ingredients are flown fresh from Italy to be prepared right here in Vegas.  The pizza definitely accounts for the taste and the price was actually pretty decent, which is surprising.  I usually equate the GVR area with forking out tons of cash but I was pleasantly surprised with Settebello's quality and pricing.  Since I've visited here, it has become pretty hard to munch on a regular ol' pizza and put a smile on because most other pizza pies I've tried doesn't even compare.  Definitely won over my vote for best pizza ever and I look forward to frequenting this joint again to try the Italian drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but their pizza selections are a bit out of my preferred range. Lots of fancy combinations. At lunch time they run a good special, so that was nice. Beer selection wasn't great, so I stuck with a pop.  Keep in mind too that it is really, REALLY thin crust, so if you don't like that, you should probably move on. I see other reviews say it's crunchy, but I found it incredibly soggy. I had to actually use a fork for parts of the pizza."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant, friendly staff, and great pricing! Just had the diavolo, recommended by Cory at the bar, and it was delicious. Definitely a place to try if you haven't."}
{"text":"I was impressed by this pizzeria. This was my first visit to this restaurant and it was for a meeting with a party of 8. We were shown to the private room that was a bit tight for our group but luckily we all enjoy each other's company and didn't mind the closeness. The chairs were put together with no space between, so anyone with a big party BEWARE. The food was all delicious, they kept our drinks filled and sold us on dessert. Of everything, the risotto balls were the best appetizer, we didn't have a single bad pizza but the Blanca special was very delicious, and you can never go wrong with Nutella pizza for dessert. Skip the custard doughnuts."}
{"text":"The only bad thing is that I can only give 5 stars to Settebello. Carmine is an artist of the \"white art\" and nobody else in town, even with the same (or better like due forni)  ingredients is able to do what a real italian from (around) Naples like him can do. Every pizza is a masterpiece perfectly crafted with passion with just the right tasteful amount of toppings and cooked perfectly to delight even a very sophisticated palate.  Bravissimo Carmine! A presto."}
{"text":"I had the Insalata Grande and half Bianca & half Emilia pizza to share. They recommended that we choose both white sauce pizzas (or both tomato sauce) when ordering 'half and half.' Overall, the food was good, but I felt the Bianca side was a little salty."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this gem after reading about in the Wednesday Food section of the Review Journal about 4 years ago.  Back then it was located on Horizon Ridge and has since moved to it's current location.  Back then I thought it was the best pizza in town so it's nice to see that they have done well enough to relocate to some prime real estate in The District.    This isn't your typical New York or Chicago style pizza.  It is classic Naples all the way.  Settebello uses the freshest ingredients and has by far the best crust I've ever had.  There are numerous house special pizzas you can order or one can make their own including any number of toppings.  The pizzas are delicious and the perfect individual size.  You can eat a whole one without feeling super heavy after.       If you're in Vegas, you have to stop by Settebello.  Whether you're a local or on the strip, it will definitely be worth your while."}
{"text":"Truly amazing.  I dream of the Diavolo....  And the rucola salad is such a simple and beautiful salad.  I've been coming here since it opened and maybe I'm just partial to the original but something about it just tastes better than the SUMMERLIN location."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here some months ago for pizza and salad apps.  Ordered beet salad with goat cheese and greens, which I had enjoyed before.  My wife ordered appetizer with tomato and basil.  My salad didn't have the goat cheese! Her's didn't have the basil! Waiter told me the goat cheese was mixed in the dressing and could not be seen, weak. We ordered pizza, one full hour later was told it had not been started yet!  We left. I think the poor service was due to the fact we did not order alcohol and we're taking a booth that could hold more people.  I guess if you want  good service and food made according to menu, drink up. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Its not the type of pizza place I'm used to, but I'll have to give them 4 stars.  My cousins originally from Chicago aren't impressed.  They are still in search for pizza as good as here.....which is going to be next to impossible. So here's my take on this place....very nice decor and very casual. The menu has no fried stuff.   The staff was very friendly and attentive. Ok so I had the Caprese for an appetizer.....Fresh mozzarella on a tomato with fresh basil,sea salt and covered in extra virgin olive oil...Wow was that yummy.  It was my first time to have fresh mozzarella and now its my favorite. Then I had the Margherita pizza, topped with sausage, mushroom, and fresh garlic and basil.  Its wood oven baked and very fresh. Not a Chicago style pizza, but I loved it. The cousins had the Pizza Lasagna, which had pretty much the same toppings as mine except for having evoo, and ricotta, and I didn't notice too much of a difference....but still yummy! For dessert, we had vanilla gelato in espresso...Wow was that good! A great way to end a fantastic dinner. I guess my cousins would have enjoyed the place, if they weren't looking for Chicago style food. I liked it since I was just hungry and I was impressed with the freshness of all the food.....a healthy restaurant according to one of the cousins. Its just a nice change of pace from the everyday pizza joint. Oh, they recommend not taking their pizza for take out....much better tasting fresh from the oven."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and will be back again soon!!! The environment is great and the craft cocktails are wonderful. Best pizza in the city by far!"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious here. The hosts are friendly and welcoming. The margarita pizza is my favorite. Would highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place. So much in fact that I had wished we had went back the next day.  Highlight dishes for me: - Bolognese Pizza: Just like the spaghetti sauce, this was layered onto your pie. A few at my table had wished there was pasta on it, I thought I was just fine without. I wouldn't have complained if there was a little more of that delicious sauce on it though!  - Brisket Pizza: A delicious pizza topped with brisket and caramelized onions. Enough said. Each slice is a hearty one filled with tender meat and delicious cheese.  - Diavola Pizza: This had the perfect amount of heat with every bite. But be warned, those crushed peppers can sneak up on ya! I really liked the sliced Finnochiona on top as well.  - Beet Salad: This came with red and yellow beets with greens in the middle, topped with goat cheese and drizzled with balsamic. To be honest, I skipped the greens because I loved the beets so much.  - Scotch Tea: This might have been one of my favorite drinks... ever. I know that's a bold statement, but I loved everything about it. Scotch with hints of jasmine. It was smooth, slightly sweet and had me asking for a second before I even finished the first. I'd come back and travel many miles just for that drink!  Service was fantastic and they have plenty of space for larger parties. I'll for sure be making my way back here. I really enjoyed all aspects of the evening!"}
{"text":"Last night was our first time here. We started with the roasted beets and the proccuto wrapped arugula. The pizza here is really good. We had the jalapeño pizza and the special which had marinated artichoke hearts. Matt was our waiter. He was very good. He checked on us often and made sure everything was good. We will be back to try the other pizzas as they all sound really good."}
{"text":"had a late dinner with some friends and was very happy with my meal  what i ate: - misto (antipasta): meats, vegetables, some cheese, focaccia: the focaccia bread was great, as was the mix of charcuterie and cheese. perfect way to get the appetite going - margherita pizza: a classic margherita. it was just right, and the with the kind of pizza they do here (thin), this was perfect - vico pizza: sausage, fennel, red onion, marscarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil: i also really liked this pizza. the sausage give it a nice smokey meaty flavor, and the onion and fennel gave it that extra umph.  - capricciosa pizza: artichoke hearts, roasted mushrooms, olives, mozzarella, basil.  basically your veggie pizza, but better. trust me  pros: - pizza! really, the food was just great. i really enjoyed all the pizzas and the antipasta - service: she was very helpful and patient with us. we came in an hour before closing, but she didnt rush us at all. she had plenty of suggestions and helped us order for a table of 6 - ambiance/decor: dark wood, mismatched chairs. really nice. great date spot! - bathroom: i know this is really random, but i loved the farmhouse sink in the bathroom. it was just soooo nice to see that the decor was also looked at in the bathroom - plenty of parking in the lot  cons: - not any i can think of  *tip* there is more than one location, and menu varies   would i come again? even though i dont live in LV, yes!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite (non Chicago deep dish) pizza spots. The staff here is great. Always friendly and on point. It has a very relaxing and laid back atmosphere, which you notice right when you walk in. The pizza is a traditional Neapolitan style. They have a good variety of pizzas, and have a special pizza of the week. (Which hasn't let me down yet!)   There is a very nice bar with a great selection of beers and cocktails. Not to big, but perfect size for a small group to unwind after work. Plus, two happy hours: 3:00p-6:00p and 8:30-to close, Mon-Fri.   So if you're looking for a great pizza, friendly staff and a place to relax at an affordable price, try Settebello."}
{"text":"Just an amazing experience.  The best customer service in all of LV, incredible apps and the best version of every pizza you have ever had in your travels.  The gelato, the drinks, everything is perfect.  This is on my must-visit every time in LV now."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time after reading all of the amazing reviews and we walked away very disappointed. The pizza we ordered, the margherita, came out minutes after we ordered it, and it was not even hot. It was soggy and barely had any flavor. So we tried dessert, the canneloni and the Bella Della Nona, and they both were flavorless as well .We didn't even finish them. The restaurant is also extremely loud because of the high ceilings. The waitress was nice and so was the hostess, just very unimpressed by their food. We will sadly not be returning."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best pizza my mouth has ever tasted.  I ended up coming to Settebello for lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday. The restaurant is located in the District. When you first walk into the restaurant you will be greeted by a friendly hostess and walked to your table. The decor consists of dark wood and granite which makes you instantly feel that you are in a high end pizzeria.   Service wise, they seemed to be short on staff when we came in. Our server seemed to also be the bartender for the day shift, but I can see that she was trying to show us as much attention as possible. I also brought a cake from a bakery prior to meeting at Settebello and asked the server to put it in the back until we were done with our meal.   I ordered the Vico, which blew my mind. I wouldn't call myself a pizza enthusiast but I know what good pizza tastes like. The pizza isn't loaded down with oil and has no tomato sauce which makes it very light. The pizza consisted of yummy sausage, fennel, mozzarella and mascarpone (no tomatoes). It was frickin delicious. I'm obsessed with the crust, which was  thin but not tastless and chewy in the middle. Highly recommended.   Overall it was great experience.  If you're anywhere near the Henderson area, you must try this place out."}
{"text":"I've already written a review for the Henderson location but felt the need to write one for this location as well. The restaurant's interior is stunning and fits perfectly in Summerlin. It is much larger than the Henderson location. There's also a lot more open space rather than sectioned off areas, which I personally like just because I enjoy watching the guys working with the wood fired oven.   Neapolitan pizzas should have a thin crispy crust that is chewy and moist at the same time. The crust should be so thin that it is hard or impossible to eat without utensils. Settebello pizzas are just that...always messy but absolutely worth it. My favorite pie still remains to be the Vico. Thank you Settebello for the consistent deliciousness and awesome service. If you haven't had a chance to try Settebello, you now have two locations to choose from!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Nice change from chain pizza. Great atmosphere and service also"}
{"text":"Settebello has what seems to be extremely authentic Italian Pizza. I, not being Italian, have zero credibility for this claim, but they use Italian Words to describe them and they are very lightly cheesed. Some are not cheesed at all if you'll believe it. They also believe in whole olives as a topping. All of it with lots of Olive Oil, all of it is excellent. This is serious pizza. It is also very little pizza. This is the only pizza place where I can comfortably eat the whole pizza. All of it. Despite having a substantial radius, the pizza is virtually two dimensional. Pizza.  Beware adding toppings: you'll pay for it. Not saying it's not worth it, the Italian meats here are exquisite, but it may require you to redistribute your stock portfolio.  The authentic Italian beers have prices that make even the most seasoned beer snob (and yes I mean myself) wince. It's not like Italy is known for beer, and these beers are largelly unknown outside of their native land. $15+ They dramatically skew the value proposition if you're looking for an exotic beer drinking night. Regular beers  are more reasonable, but unremarkable.  The prices are overall great. Most of the better pizzas are $12 or less. Keep in mind they are just for one person, but still an excellent value. The dining room is small but pleasant and gets great light. Service has been great.  They don't have ranch. I realize this is very \"authentic\" but they need ranch."}
{"text":"One of the best place in Vegas to have a proper Napolitan Pizza! Also prosciutto with mini focaccia is delicious! Must try!"}
{"text":"One word, amazing! As in flawless from start to finish. I don't normally drink vodka but the Moscow Mules at this spot are out of sight and the perfect way to start a perfect meal. I think I've had almost every pizza on the menu but my go to is the namesake Settebello. There is something ideal about the blend of ingredients that creates the Fourth of July in your mouth. The wine list here is on point and service is consistent but sometimes sluggish. 100% worth a first and tenth visit."}
{"text":"I love this perfectly cooked thin pizza.  It's light but has good flavor.  The crust is cooked really well.  The toppings also taste fresh compared to other places.  The price is a bit above average for the amount of food you get, but sometimes it's worth it.  If like pizza, and i fyou're not a fan of  Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Little Caesar's, and etc...  then you probably won't be disappointed by this place."}
{"text":"everything is excellent and they have wonderful wines and cocktails. my new favorite watering hole. makes me homesick for ma Bella italia"}
{"text":"When pizza is this good, it's a shame when it's over. I came to lunch with Dana S. and we ate til we could no more eat. Actually I'm sure that we could have eaten more, we just ran out of food.   We ordered the namesake pizza and it was delicious. However, one of the pieces hardly had any topping on it and the pinenuts were not evenly dispersed. Verrrrry important in a pinenut pizza! I gobbled heartily and was sad when it was over.   I also had a salad which made me feel better about myself. I don't know if I would get one the next time because it was on the pricey side but it was tasty.   I want to come back and try other pizzas. It's located by Whole Foods--the Yelp map is a little confused. Also--swing by WF after for gelato...it's half the price!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! All the times I've eaten here the service has been good and the pizza is amazing! It is actually authentic Italian style pizza, not the fake stuff from the chain restaurants.  The Ingredients used in their pizza seem to be high quality! This is one of my favorite  pizzas in the Las Vegas valley"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  The ingredients are fresh, and everything seems handmade.  It was a comfortable place to eat and stay to talk after we were done.  It reminds me a bit of Spacca Napoli, a pizzeria in Chicago."}
{"text":"Me and my wife love this place. We order all the antipasti . She loves the artichoke crostini. I love the prosciutto involtini . My kids love the pizza. The pizzas are soft and charred the way the chef indented.  Its a different style than the NYC pizza."}
{"text":"Great Neapolitan style pizza... Real wood fired pizza, slightly salty flavorful crust, panzanella salad and I love the Italian micro brew selection even if it has changed from the chestnut ale that was to die for!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time for dinner with the girls after a long Monday. The good points are the decor inside, the flavors and the wine. The staff are pleasant, but some of them could make a little more effort in my opinion (although I will say service is extremely quick). I also have to agree with another review I read - the pizzas are a little undercooked in the middle and therefore a tiny bit soggy and I personally prefer a more crispy base. Overall I do like the ambience but think the food could be improved slightly."}
{"text":"My recommendation: Pizza Lasagna  As an appetizer, the Caprese is a winner.  I'm not a big fan of pork and unfortunately that's the only meat topping they have but I don't miss it for a second here. All of their pizzas are so tasty. Especially the pizza lasagna. Settebello's has the best pizza I've ever had in my LIFE!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. I dont go anywhere else. Settebello is the best. Four cheese pizza is amazing.  And Nutella banana pizza as a dessert is soooo delicious.  Also happy hour pizza $5each.  Must have!!! The best!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Las Vegas - finally!!! A cute, trendy restaurant that does not break the bank, not on the strip, and is freaken good!!!!!  A big group of 16 people had reservations for a private room. The moscato and the settlebello pizza were phenomenal! The crust was not too thick, the flavor was amazing, and the pizza was 12 inches - good to share! The fried risotto was also pretty amazing! Our waitress was pretty good so no complaints there.   I had a great time and I was happy happy happy!!!"}
{"text":"Since I moved away from Vegas, it's been almost 3 yrs since I last dined at Settebello.  During a recent trip back, we stayed at GVR and decided to walk over to The District and have dinner here one evening.  I was glad to see it was still around, and most importantly that the Pizza was still very good.  This time I went for the Margherita DOC (Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), $13. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=hkekGVh_GJ4QjwweLrCsjw#hkekGVh_GJ4QjwweLrCsjw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=kfsNFds_cvzeN1IEoAjqZQ#kfsNFds_cvzeN1IEoAjqZQ  The Better Half opted for the Settebello (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), $13.50. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=LnvEfX_z6Tt0JoZnVA7i3A#LnvEfX_z6Tt0JoZnVA7i3A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=LFy3ytX6YHx_EBvqvMt6yg#LFy3ytX6YHx_EBvqvMt6yg  The Pizza was awesome of course, just how I remember it.  The Crust was slightly burnt and the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor.  They've kept the quality of their product very high.  Our friend who joined us for dinner was also very impressed.  Although he's lived in Vegas for over 15 yrs, he never had Settebello until now.  He also had the Settebello and was blown away.  Service was good.  The server kept our Wine and Water glasses full.  Return Factor - 92%"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE pizza place...it reminds me of Neopolitan Pizza. So delicious and worth the drive across town for me. I visit at least 3 times a month."}
{"text":"Since I moved from France to the US, this place is the best for pizzas. I tried many places in the US, and this one is without hesitation the best.  Not too expensive, with a great service, I come there each time I am near Vegas.   Every pizza lover who' s passing by should try it!"}
{"text":"Took a friend with us today who's not eaten here before and she called the salad and the pizza orgasmic. We had the Insalada grande which has roasted mushrooms, artichokes and the best olives in a fantastic mix of greens and an arugula salad which has a lemony dressing which is simply amazing.  We all three had our own pizzas, one Setebello for the meat eater and a Quatro Formaggio with buffalo mozzarella instead of the Gorgonzola which in my opinion overwhelms the other three cheeses. All I can say is this is killer pizza, the best in the Vegas area. Waitstaff is awesome and attentive and always a wonderful experience here, never fails to impress!"}
{"text":"Perfection and simplicity. This pizza is exactly what I had in Napoli, Italy years before. The crust is thin and chewy flavored with the wood-fired oven. The red sauce is also wonderful, light and tangy, they must use fresh tomatoes as it does that have the strong \"tomato paste\" flavor as many other pizzerias have.  Go and enjoy true Napoli style pizza. Does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Best pizza in LV... and don't get me started on the pasta  super fresh ingredients, great ambiance, gr at wine and beer selection.  A must when in Vegas.. 10"}
{"text":"So good. Had Artichoke Crostini...definetley needed fork and knife. Pizza has nice char from the wood fired oven. Great place for drinks and appetizer before a movie (They are in same plaza as Village theater). Would come back after for pizza and zepolles."}
{"text":"Had to try settobello after hearing it had come to summerlin. Pizza is very European .. Which I usually love. I felt like this pizza was almost undercooked in the middle. No real pastas on the menu either ..,sorry but If you want real pizza and pasta try dom demarcos down the street- it's amazing !"}
{"text":"Whenever in Vegas and in the Henderson area you need to check this place out.  We have been here twice on friends recommendation.  The place is easy to get to and small.  They do have a small bar and seating is comfortable.  Now for the food..we always order a insalata grande and it's perfect for 2 or 3 people.  The ingredients are so delicious and fresh.  We have tried several of their pizzas and you can't go wrong with any of them.  I really love how they feature their Italian beers and wines.  Not pricey for a bottle of wine.  It really has a nice neighborhood feel to it.  The service has been great...I can't complain.  They do have kids plate option, which includes gelato and a drink, which they do not advertise."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner place is nicely put together. Sat at the pizza bar ( which gets really hot after a while) and ordered a pizza and some salads all was good. They have a wood fired oven which is where they cook their pizzas. I will be going back definitely and try their other dishes. The only downfall is the place was pretty loud."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while and every time we got our pizza soggy and half cooked.   Today we asked the waitress to get our pizza cooked enough and again we got our pizza soggy.    When we returned the pizza to the kitchen to get it cooked longer our waitress said they would throw away this particular pizza and make a new one so it would take longer.  3 minutes later we got our pizza back (we are pretty sure it was the same one that we returned to the kitchen since we made several cuts in it before and the cuts were there when we got it back) and again it was a little bit more cooked on the outside, but inside it was still undercooked.   Coupled with our waitress attitude (I do not know why she had to come up with the story that she threw our first pizza in the trash and the second one was freshly cooked when we did not even ask for it) and same soggy pizza, we are not coming back.  In general we had a good service before.  Today it was different.   We never saw this place full, we figured there must be a reason.    We put 2 stars for the ambiance and the topping on the pizza. But they need to figure out how to cook the pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Quick service. Settebello Special managed to include numerous ingredients without becoming too heavy or muddled in flavor. The pine nuts were an inspired touch. Capricciosa was good, but the Greek olives were too strong and a bit of an off choice. Artichokes worked well. Diavola was perfect. Not too spicy, and the Nero d'Avola complemented it wonderfully.  Warning: crust is veryveryvery thin. So thin that it takes some care just to hold it..."}
{"text":"I suffer from an addiction to pizza, and I have an overwhelming sense of urgency to try every single pizza joint I come across. I may need an intervention. I didn't come here to compare this to other pizza places in town, and if you are, you might be disappointed because you can't put this up against NY style or Chicago style, this is in a class of it's own......Neopolitan. Side note, this is the only VPN certified place in Las Vegas, and only one of two places in Nevada.  What we ordered...  Quattro Formaggi-Crushed Tomatoes, Fontina Cheese, Gorgonzola Cheese, Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, I loved the strong taste of gorgonzola cheese, my aunt's thought it was a bit overwhelming, but I love cheese.  Margherita DOC- Crushed Tomatoes,Imported Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, now if you look at their menu, there is two Margherita pizzas, please choose the DOC. The difference is the imported buffalo mozzarella, and it's excellent. DOC is denominazione di origine controllata, which translates to, controlled designation of origin, basically quality assurance for food products like cheese and wine, if you have ever seen a Chianti with a pink wrapping around the cork, it will say DOCG this way you are assured it's not manipulated.    Ended the meal with Torta della Nonna, I love lemon and especially when it's a chilled tart, nothing better in the summer, but this I felt fell short of anything special. It tasted old like it had been in the made a couple days prior and sat in the fridge.   Big props for all of the ingredients they import, and list on the menu."}
{"text":"I've really come to appreciate VPN style pizza. Because of the high quality ingredients, it truly distinguishes this pizza apart from any other pizzeria. Imported flour from Napoli, San Marzano tomatoes, meats from various American distributers and Buffalo Mozzarella give this place the ingredients to make one hell of a pizza.   What we ordered:  Arancini appetizer- not the best I've had, but I came here for pizza.  Margherita DOC Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Simple yet exquisite. Yes I just used that word to describe pizza. Truly my favorite pizza here.  Diavola Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. This definitely had a bite to it, I like spicy food, the peppered salame gave it a delicious spice to it.  Pizza Carbonara Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Egg, Mozzarella, Cracked Pepper, Extra Virgin Olive Oil My very pizza with egg on it that I liked. I was a bit surprised myself. The oven cooked the egg perfectly to blend with the rest of the ingredients. This was an excellent slice of pie.  Settebello Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Still a classic. Along with the DOC, this is a staple when ordering here. Not usually a fan of sausage of pizza, but a total exception to my rule here.  Pizza Special: Rafael (different special weekly) Mozzarella, Salame, Roasted Onion, Garlic, Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Basil, Parmigiana, EVOO. Excellent! This was my second favorite pizza sampled that day.   Caramel Budino-very sweet, if you like caramel, this is the dessert for you.  S'mores Calzone-it was essentially chocolate chips melted within a calzone.  Bella Mella-Dessert Pizza was excellent, cinnamon apples and mascarpone was delish.  Zeppole-nutella filled donuts. Need I say more? This was my favorite dessert out of the four we tried.  For a true hand crafted pizza, this is the place I will come. Being the only VPN certified place in town, Settebello stands out from other pizzerias. Sign up to be on the email list and be notified of their weekly pizza special.  *Sidenote, I really wish people would stop complaining about the pizza being undercooked and/or wet. This is what VPN style pizza is, it's not Chicago style, it's not New York style. Grimaldi lovers probably won't appreciate this style of pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!! The atmosphere of this place is nice, their wine is great and their pizza is to die for. I'm a fan of very simple pizza made with great ingredients. My favorite is the Marguerita DOC. You don't need much on a pizza as long as the ingredients are quality ones. And they are. The tomato sauce is fresh and bright, the cheese is delicious, the crust is incredibly toasted and the basil just adds that special flavor. I'm a big fan of this style pizza and this is my go to place."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pizza I've had in a while. The crust was perfect: chewy on the inside but crisp on the edges. The cheese and toppings were tasty, but not overpowering. The (Moscow) Mule sampler was excessive (in a good way). Three full sized cocktails! Beers are in bottles and not on tap. Service was fantastic. Great advice on selections and very attentive."}
{"text":"Whenever in Henderson Settebello beckons me. Delicious. Authentic. Yeah. Mmmmm.  I give it five stars because the pizza is delicious and reminds me of the year and a half I spent in Italy. It's not like the standard American-style pizza served by nearly every other pizza joint.  But don't let that scare you.  I'm not a pizza snob, I'll gulp down the ordinary stuff too.  Ordinary is ordinary, Settebello is Pizza Napoletana and worth trying.   My favorite pizza is the Settebello with olives substituted for the pine nuts.  If I'm lucky and can eat there often enough that I don't want the same thing as last time, then I go with the Diavola.  A great combination of flavor and kick.   The service has always been attentive.  I've not had a bad experience in the dozen or so times I've been in."}
{"text":"When I want great authentic pizza this is the first place that comes to mind.  They are very conveniently located in a shopping center, which can made it difficult to find parking at times. When you walk in it's very clean, not huge, casual, and everyone is very courteous.   Each pizza is big enough for one very hungry person to each or two not so hungry people to share. I've never had a bad pizza here. My favorite is the the Bianca (and I add prosciutto). Each pizza is very simple and to the point. There isn't anything fancy added just simple, fresh, top-notch ingredients. They don't hide anything. They don't try to reimagine or rediscover the traditional pizza, they make it the way it's supposed to be made.   A must if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"It was good but not great. I wanted to like this place so much because of all the great reviews, but in the end I wasn't that impressed. We got the Margherita DOC and the Quattro Formaggi. We liked the Margherita better. The cheese on the Quattro tasted funny. If we go back, we'll have to try something else."}
{"text":"Great pizza, nothing more nothing less, I would stick with the Settebello pie, it's the best"}
{"text":"I've been on a search for amazing pizza, and this is one of the best pies I've had anywhere. The crust is textured incredibly well, the chewiest crust you've had. The Emilia had an amazing set of toppings that tasted both fresh and perfectly complimentary to each other.  Near perfect."}
{"text":"Stellar service, reasonable prices, large portions and the best GF crust EVER.  Real pizza. Real Italian."}
{"text":"Got the Margarita with prosciutto added and the Settebello. Both were delicious. Dough is perfect in crunchiness and chewiness.   Ordered for take out, they said 15 mins wait time but it was a lot quicker.   I'll be back. My new go-to pizza place in Henderson."}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation from friends, but when I found out the establishment is owned by Brad Otton, that was another reason to pay homage to this joint.  The guy was an awesome QB at USC who led the team to one of the most-satisfying victories I had ever witnessed: 'SC's 1996 win over Notre Dame at the LA Coliseum.  But I digress.  I'm giving this rating with one caveat, though: I think the restaurant's HVAC was too cool, and consequently, the pizza got cold before I could finish eating the damn thing.  Nevertheless, if this is what authentic Italian pizza is like, it compares favorably, in my opinion, with NY-style pizza.  I had the Pizza Lasagna.  Excellent.  My friends and I went on a Sunday for lunch, which I have to say was perfect because there was no wait.  I will definitely return on my next visit to Vegas, because there were other selections on the menu that really caught my eye."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least a dozen times. The food is always perfect. I order the Insalata Grande which may be the most perfect salad ever. Mixed greens, roasted mushrooms, pine nuts, marinated artichoke hearts, shaved parmesean....oh yum! Then I have a pizza and it does not matter which one because they are equally exquisite. I love the smokey charred crust that is chewy and crisp. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Stellar food, great service! You can't beat this place. Wonderfully authentic. The ingredients are the freshest, most flavorful you can get and their new menu items like the beat salad and the Pizza Bolognese are amazing! Something for every taste, even the kids. Don't forget to treat yourself to a panna cotta for desert."}
{"text":"This has been one of the best Pizza Restaurants I've been to. The service was incredible as soon as we walked in. They seated us right away even though they were pretty busy. The waiter refilled our drinks without us pestering him. The pizza is amazong. I ordered the bistro pizza, and if youre a fan of white sauce pizza, this is the one for you. I definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to try a new pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"What a nice pleasant surprise. Right by where we go to the movies. Had no idea it was here. We had their signature settebello pizza and cappuccino. It was wonderfully priced right and came with friendly service from Alexa. Like Arnold said \"I'll be back\"!!"}
{"text":"To make things simple the pizzas were under cooked, over priced,& over rated. On the 4 cheese pizza which i ordered the cheeses were not evenly distributed on the pizza, each slice had different cheese flavors and was lacking cheese in total. The crust was mushy & soft."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. You have to try this place. From what I hear (from my Italian son) it's straight out of Napoli!"}
{"text":"I ended up here by accident. Definitely the best pizza that I ever ate in Vegas, very authentic Italian :) I chose the Quattro Formaggi with Pesto on one side that was great. The peak of my night was when I tried to put a bit of house olive oil on the pizza crust. The oil tasted heavenly. :) definitely highly recommend this place to anyone and coming back here!"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Just wish they have bigger sizes."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is by far the best pizza place in the Las Vegas Valley!  Being Italian as I am, I know my pizza's \"Yum\"  If you like pizza, you like to taste each individual ingredient in each delicious bite of pizza, this is the place of quality and you should differently go!  The prices are very reasonable and the ambiance is very Italian.  I had an awesome conversation with the General Manager, Natalia Formisano and a true professional she is who knows the business of management, people, customers, and takes pride in providing services and products that make this pizza place 2nd to none!  As a business man of many entities over the years, she should be promoted to definitely a Regional Manager Position!  Great Job!"}
{"text":"When Settebello gets things right, I'd say it's a 4-4.5* product - wonderful Italian-style pizza with a thin, crisp crust, and I also feel like their toppings are pretty high quality. I usually opt for something off the daily special list but am also a big fan of the namesake pizza and the Diavola.  The problem is that every so often, I'll be served a pizza that is undercooked or is way overcooked (as in heavily burnt - I definitely appreciate char, but I mean really overcooked). I just don't get the quality control issue since it can go either way.  If you can deal with occasional inconsistency, this is a great place - but it's a gamble."}
{"text":"Food was great! Had the arugula wrapped with prosciutto and a margherita doc. Alcohol was a little warm and our order was incorrect first time so I knocked off a star. Servers were friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Decided to patronise Settebello again after just a couple of days even though it is a significant drive away from where we live. This time during the week (Tuesday) and in the afternoon (4:30P) instead of evening.   I got the namestake Settebello pie and reordered the Nutella pie w/strawberry for dessert this time paired with Hazelnut gelato (the special was oreo, which did not sound personally appealing). While I did not like it as MUCH as the Four Cheese I tried on Sunday, it may have the virginity effect that made that pie taste so much better in my mind; only way to unscientifically test if this is in fact true is to try the Four Cheese again, perhaps this time with the Settebello meat toppings as an add-on. Food was excellent in any case and the service the same.   Observation on the 3PM-6PM 'Happy Hour': 5$ ea. for a mini pizzas sounds great for finishing off the entire menu offerings in regards to pizzas. The next time we visit we will probably go that route; just requires that one sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Honestly the best pizza I've found in Vegas, and that's saying a lot. A little inconsistent sometimes ( the pizza can, on occasion, come out a little mushy) but! When it's served right it's the absolute best !!! You need to try this pie !!"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  What is up with the hype behind this place?  I get they have AUTHENTIC Napoli pizza.  I get that they use fresh, quality ingredients.   What I don't get is why I pay $13 for a soggy sponge with some toppings on it.    I used to work in a restaurant.  I made pizzas in a wood burning oven.  I hand tossed the dough.  I even made the dough from scratch.  And despite my being a busboy, not a cook, my pies were still better than those I had in two separate visits to Settebello.    I just don't get the hype, sorry.  (3 stars for the excellent service)."}
{"text":"went on an off night so it wasn't too crowded but it looks like a fun spot for an after work crowd.  we started with apps of bruschetta with crudo and riceballs.  the bruschetta was really good.  top quality ingredients all the way around including a nice crystalized parm cheese.  the riceballs were also good but it was hard to enjoy them with such a high price tag.  especially considering they only give you 2 balls.  for dinner I had the settebello pizza.  it was also good but it came out before we finished our apps and it could have used another 15 or 20 seconds in the oven.  it's not pizzeria Bianca but its pretty darn good.  we shared the caramel pudding for dessert.  it was good but half the size would have been plenty and the cookie was too similar in texture to the pudding.  I would have preferred something similar to a Chinese almond cookie texture wise."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best pizza I've had on the west-coast! As a vegetarian, I order the Caprese,  Margherita Pizza and Nutella Pizza for dessert. Settebello utilizes high quality ingredients and the prices are affordable. It is never a disappointment when I dine here. I, highly, recommend this place of authentic Italian pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza is wonderful... Coffee is terrible Service is Terrible Great Place and Location... They need to improve on their product and get a whole new crew.  Coffee in Italy is wonderful... Bad duplicate.  Waiters need to wash hands & quit holding onto their personal cell phones.  Not a place for that... Owners are sweet.  You need to watch your investment closer.  Good Luck..."}
{"text":"All the pizzas are mouthwatering. The beet salad was tip top. I fell in love more and more with each bite. And I'd encourage everyone to cap off their meal with the \"to die for\" tiramisu and un café. And eat your pizza with a fork and knife! The pizzas fall apart easily do not try and pick your slice up...it's a good thing though because the pizza dough is dripping in this amazingly robust marinara. And to top off the whole experience the entire wait staff was incredibly good looking and polite."}
{"text":"LOVE the pizza.....fresh ingredients, Neopolitan crust (like in Naples!) and they sold me a 50# bag of 00 flour so I can make it at home.  Super nice people and good service. So glad they opened a location closer to us."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Las Vegas. This is truly authentic Napoli pizza , fresh and crazy tasty. It has a unique dough that is just like in Napoli, Italy. Very similar to the oldest and the best pizzeria in the country, which is \"Lombardi's\" in New York. Everything is imported from Italy , all the ingredients which makes it healthy pizza as well. I have also tried their gluten free pizza and it is the best one that I have tried in Las Vegas and I have tried all of them pretty much.  The service is great also , my favorite location is the one in Henderson. Settebello pizzeria is the only place where I would go to have a pizza . Because it is so authentic and you can feel in every bite a taste of Italy. All those people that wrote bad reviews have NO IDEA how the authentic Italian pizza should taste."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM  it's really gOod! it's the rustic kind of pizza. my bf took me here after we tried this napoletana pizzeria in phoenix, az call pezzeria bianco and we both madly fell in love...therefore, we just had to find a similar one in vegas and it's setebello. give it a try, it's amazing."}
{"text":"I really loved the Henderson location so I wanted to try this new one on Sahara today w/ my mom as my treat for late Mother's Day...service was 5 stars; the 2 servers were very accommodating and attentive. We had 2 kinds of pizza: settebello and the vico one; I actually ended up loving the vico one more, it was a white pizza, the red onions paired well w/ the super creamy cheese. The one star off is for  the settebello pizza; it was pretty good too except I felt like the marinara sauce was a bit too acidic and there was too much sauce on this pizza."}
{"text":"I tried Settebello for the first time last night.  I had read the reviews of my Yelp friends and likes the sound of the Rafael pizza which was on their special of the day and it sounded good.    When I talked to the young man at the podium and told him I wanted to place a To Go order, I told him about the pizza and the reviews.  He told me he'd check and a short time later, he came back and told me they could make it but they didn't have the caramelized onions for it.  I told him to order it anyway.  In just a few short minutes, the pizza was brought to me as I waited in their small waiting area.  I brought it home and it was very good.  It was also the perfect size for two people.  My preference is still for thick crust, Sicilian style pizza, but I can see that Settebello will be on my rotation list.  And, I want to try some of the others as well.  Good service and good pizza!"}
{"text":"Sadly the place has grown in popularity and declined in quality. When I lived here in Henderson I brought clients here at least twice a week for lunch.  I've eaaily visited this location more than 200 times, never a complaint.  I was also a patron at the old location off Horizon Ridge Parkway.   Visited last night with friends as our guests.  4 salads, wines, 4 pizzas.  My pizza came first, cold, soggy.  It had sat ready before it was brought to me.  Wait, wait, wait for the other 3.  5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes the other 3 pizzas arrived.  Mentioned, just mentioned this to food server, she said \"Sorry, they only can do 5 pizzas at a time\".  Crazy logic since we were a party of 4. Poor quality, slow service, not on my list of must visit places anymore.  Sadly, quality and service greatly diminished."}
{"text":"If you have been to Italy one taste of this magnificent pizza will wisk you back there instantly. True attention to detail allows for a pizza experience. Pizza Hut it ain't... try it you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and this restaurant has never failed to deliver. Great food and wine. A must try for anyone looking for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I live all the way on the other side of town, so I seldom venture to this neighborhood. But this past Sunday (6/11/13), we were trying out a movie at the new Galaxy theater and decided to take advantage of the opportunity to try a restaurant on that side of town. After hearing amazing things about Settebello for years, we chose it.  It was amazing!!! The pizzas on the menu are all very interesting sounding - great combinations of flavors. It was really hard to decide. We chose one tomato-based pizza and one without tomato sauce: the Settebello and the Vico. We both preferred that Vico by quite a bit, but both were amazing. They both had the same Italian sausage and buffalo mozzarella that melted into a wet, gooey sauce all over the pizza. I think what put the Vico over the edge is that in addition to the melty cheesy goodness, it has thick cream on it as well. The crust for both pizzas was perfect - doughy but not too thick. Definitely upgrade to the buffalo mozzarella for any pizza! You can do that for only $3!  Service was really nice and attentive, and the space has a great feel - open ceilings so that you can see the air ducts and a bit of the loft look. I don't know how often we'll make the drive all the way over there, but I will definitely stop in anytime I'm on that side of town!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza I've had since moving to Nevada. It's pretty unique but the ingredients are very fresh and despite it being about a 25 minute drive, I'll be going there quite a bit in the future. The Ceprese appetizer was delicious as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Settabello's with a couple of friends for dinner because our Italian foreign exchange student said it was the closest to real Italian food she had found here in Vegas. The service was fast and the waiter was very helpful when we asked what would be some good choices. We salad, hot beats, a meat appetizer and two pizzas. The food was great and they kept our drinks. Nation point I would highly recommend trying this place if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Grandson eats gluten free and they have the best ever. Gluten free margarita . Yummy."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and salad for the price.   They think they are fancy with their wine list.  It is not that good of a wine list and my wife had a sparkling wine served in a red wine glass...yeah.  Half of it was wasted on the pour.  Stick with beer here."}
{"text":"Settebello is very expensive with food quality that doesn't fully justify the price. The waiters and serving staff is comprised of mostly younger high schoolers, who are chatty with one another and not super attentive. If you're looking for great quality pizza and service and don't mind price, I'd encourage you to go to Grimaldi's. If you want pizza that's a few inches above good AND in the District while price is a factor in your decision, check out Balboa Pizza."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza!  I can't say its the best, because there are different types of pizza. If you're looking for a light pizza, with a thin crust, that tastes like authentic Italian pizza, and gives you a whole personal size to yourself, then you want to come here.  I ate the whole pizza to myself, and didn't feel an ounce of guilt.  In fact, my muffin top didn't spew over at all!  I ordred the Pizza Carbonera and was in love with all the flavors: crushed tomatoes, fresh mozarella (this really makes a difference in a pizza), the crust cooked to perfection and really thin, and the cured bacon....yum!  I'm definitely coming back to try other pizza on the menu!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great here but I'm a bigger fan of their caprese sandwich and focaccia. Its fresh tasting with mozzarella, tomato, basil, forgot which type of meat between focaccia. I love dipping each bite of the sandwich in some balsamic vinegar.  I just wish they would serve the sandwiches at dinner too and not just at lunch. They need to open another location on the west side of town."}
{"text":"Frickin amazing, second only to Tony's Pizza Rock.  Excellent pizza, good ambience with great service and staff. Get a margherita doc and the jalapeno-pear marmalade pizza you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place, the service was friendly, attentive, and as far as I'm concerned can't be improved on.  We stopped in for some pizzas and I just wasn't impressed.  We got a carbonarra which had 4 slices if pancetta and maybe 3 small leaves if basil on it, not enough for me.  The eggs are scrambled which really killed it for me.  The cheese was just a little light but not a problem.  We also had the mageritta DOC and 5 slivers of cheese is not enough for me on that either.  I like these pizzas a little thicker and more sauce so you can scoop it all up with the crust.  The dough was tasty and cooked very well.  Prices are right about par for a place like this.  I've had better wood fired pizza here locally and I do not go to pizza house for the decor."}
{"text":"Satisfying quickies are the best, especially in the end when you both know it was a very orgasmic experience.  Both being your tummy and the empty plate in front of you!  Three, four, five, or even 69 course meals are all nice and dandy but sometimes you just need that quick fix and Settebello hits the \"spot\" and delivers.    Eat it like you mean it!  You know what I'm talking about, because as soon as the pizza comes out of the oven you have to eat it right away otherwise it gets cold.  Right now I'm listening to JT's Blue Ocean Floor and I'll get this review done by the time this song ends, quickie quick quick.  So after visiting my parents and brother I left a little early to grub before heading to trivia and the closest bookmark I had to Shakespeare's was Settebello.  Looking at the menu I didn't see any distinct ingredients that I haven't had before on my pizza so I did the bro thing, we like our toppings on top, and chose the bottom most item which was the white pizza, Emilia.  I had a glass of the Sangria also.    My pizza came out perfect, the ingredients matches that of my other favorite place and you can tell it's from out of this country, especially my lovely Italian bacon.  Obliviously I ordered it traditional meaning uncut so it gets to my table faster but you can have the server bring it to you cut up.  Uh oh, JT is starting to repeat himself.  They do have happy hour at the bar but I didn't go for that since I could easily finish two pizzas by myself.  I didn't create my own pizza but you can add on ingredients to a pre-constructed pizza.  I love the inside and how there are servers, my server did an excellent job.  But the next time I need to try a salad, red pizza, dessert, and have straight up wine.  When rumors float around they are sometimes bad but if the rumors are true about Settebello and they open up a second location at Sahara and Ft. Apache then the Summerlin folks need to feel lucky!  Who wants to break that location in with me?!"}
{"text":"Never lets me down.  So darn good.    Quite pleased with myself for venturing out and ordering something different.  I usually get the delicious Settebello namesake pizza.   This go around we tried the Tartufo (truffles, walnuts, speck, cheese) and the carbonara.  Nice contrasting choices if I do say so myself.  The tartufo was a white pizza and the carbonara had the excellent red sauce.  Both were scrumptious and had me making my OH face during the first bites.    We also tried the nutella s'mores calzone.  I don't even like marshmallows, yet it was pure bliss.    I maintain.....best sit down restaurant style pizza in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while and what better time than pi day, 3/14/16, to have a pizza pie :) We came around 8pm which was during happy hour but the space was pretty empty. I would give my dining experience 5 stars for service and 3.5 for food. We ordered strictly from the happy hour menu:  We started with the arancini (friend risotto balls) and the artichoke crostini. I did not like the arancini. Whenever I see this on the menu, I typically order it. Settebello's version did not have enough flavor in the risotto. Instead, the predominant taste was that of the deep fried outside. However, I really LOVED the tomato sauce it was served with. It was super tasty and fresh. I liked the artichoke crostini much better than the arancini. It had good flavor; of course I think anything with goat cheese does. I think it could have used more balsamic reduction than just the garnish.  Next we decided on the Dia Vola and the Vico pizzas. The Dia Vola was spicy, but almost so much so that I didn't really taste much else (I do have a pretty high tolerance for spice). It was still good though and I love the crust of Neapolitan style pizza in general; it was perfectly foldable. *Side note: I believe they are VPN certified which means they conform to standards that make this legit Neapolitan pizza. A VPN certification is rare and they are the only ones in Las Vegas that can boast of it.*  I enjoyed the Vico pizza much more. We ordered this for my boyfriend because he loves white pizza but I enjoyed the flavors too as they all nicely complemented each other. Again, it was good but it wasn't anything amazing.  Lastly, we ordered the house made crostata ricotta e Nutella for dessert. It was delicious! I wish it wasn't drizzled with Nutella because the flavor on its own was wonderful. It was just slightly sweet. Would definitely order this again.  Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner and were able to order 5 dishes and a Peroni for just $30. Great happy hour prices! We left very full and we were super hungry to begin with because we had just come from the gym. Additionally, the service was excellent. Our server was Bethanie and she was very sweet, attentive, and quick. Our hostess was also a doll. Thank you ladies for taking pride in your work and making our experience so enjoyable.  I think the next time I visit Settebello will be at the Henderson location. Yelpers rave about that location so I purposely came to the Summerlin location first to give them a fair review. Additionally, I wouldn't order the same pizzas again as I wasn't wowed by either of them."}
{"text":"Pizza place located in village square! The decor is beautiful. Excellent drink menu! I ordered the margarita pizza, paid $10. Idk what it was, but I didn't care for the crust. It was a little too doughy for my liking, but the actually pizza minus the crust was awesome! I loved that flavor. It tasted really fresh and the cheese was great. I'll have to come back and try the meatballs"}
{"text":"Never would I have guessed that I, a New Yorker who finds LA's Pizzeria Mozza the best gourmet pizza in the country, would have given 5 stars to a pizza restaurant near Cheesecake Factory in suburban Las Vegas. But I am -- and it's worth it. During the week staying nearby, I came here twice and was wowed every time. I first chose the proscuitto and romaine lettuce pizza, and it was perfectly crisp with the right combination of ingredients without being messy or too greasy. The second night I chose the white pizza with fennel sausage, and it honestly beat the Susan Finiger's fennel sausage pizza at Mozza. The gelato here - especially the peanut butter gelato -- is not to be missed. The best cup of coffee I've had outside of Europe. If you are in Vegas, Henderson or at Green Valley, this is a must."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town by far! I love the great quality of service and the perfect portion pizza"}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent - Napoli style, as everyone else has noted.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious, and the selection is varied. The ambiance inside is quite casual. It was started right here in Vegas and there are only 2 other locations in the country. Prices are good - about $12 for an individual pie. Bonus points for being somewhat close to my house. Double bonus points because I went there with 2 toddlers who were running around and screaming and the waiter was super nice and accomodating, bringing us extra breadsticks, etc.  Overall, Settebello is definitely at the top of my non-strip list for visitors."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of pizza from a lot of places, but settebello surpasses all of them.  It is NOT like dominoes or Pizza Hut, and I mean that in a good way.  everything is ridiculously well made and still comes out fast.  It's perfect for a date or grabbing some beers and pizza with you boys.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"If the server Andrew ask me one more time if everything is OK, i am going to shoot myself. 2 days later i am still having nighmare about this. I had to count because it was getting ridiculous. 7 times to check if everything is OK.  I am glad I exerience a different service on the many occasion I ate there or I will never go back. The pizza are excellent but sometime 1 person can ruin your meal."}
{"text":"Slice of Heaven! Service was on mark! Most delicious pizza in Vegas!  This is just a few quotes from local papers that describe what you get at Settebello. From Yelpers to friends, if you bring up great tasting pizza in Las Vegas, Settebello is what comes up. I'm almost embarrassed to admit that this was my first time to try Settebello's pizza.  Yes, I love food.  Yes, I Yelp.  And Yes, I enjoy a good pizza every now and then.  So, what has stopped me all these years is the opportunity to try Settebello.  Well, with $1 Margherita Pizza Night, I could not resist any longer.  It's all about a great tasting Margherita Pizza for me.  And that's exactly what you get here at Settebello. I'm not a fan of a thick crusted, overly sauced, and high calorie pizza.  So, their Margherita is perfect.  What you get is a thin crusted, lightly sauced pizza with mozzarella, basil, parmigiano, and olive oil.  I had mushrooms and sausage added just for the extra boost of protein and flavor.  Their Margherita  is pretty close to what you expect in Naples.  Believe me, I know.   Regarding price, the restaurant, and service, keep in mind that I ate here on $1 Margherita Pizza Night.  That means lines and a longer wait.  This wasn't a normal night so I'm not going to base my rating on their service.  The size of the restaurant was spacious with seating at the bar, booths, and their outside patio.  As for price, even though I only paid $1 for my pizza, their regular price for a pizza was about $10.  Not bad, not bad at all.    Overall, I love me some pizza and Settebello is not only as good as it gets, but also as authentic as it gets.    YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (027/366)"}
{"text":"Settebello is one of my favorite places to get a Margherita pizza in Las Vegas. Their Margherita is as authentic as it gets.  It's basically just sauce and cheese, but so damn good.  I have also tried the Quattro Formaggi (four cheese pizza), Marinara (no cheese), and the Bianca.  All are good, but it's the Margherita that has my heart.   There is no wrong time to go to this Settebello.  It's not as busy as the Henderson location and I have never waited to be seated.  The best time to go to Settebello is during happy hour (M-F, 3 PM to 6 PM) when apps have special prices, beers are half off, and a personal pizza is only $5. I have never had a poor experience when it comes to service at this location.  Overall, Settebello is the best.  I find it very difficult to give Settebello any less than 5-Stars, especially since they serve pizza exactly how I like it."}
{"text":"Thank God for Settebello! It turns out that I've been under a rock for over 20 years.   Did you know that \"pizza\" joints do not truly make real pizza? Unless it's Vera-certified (aka Verace-certified) then what they're making is an imitation.  Quick history lesson: Pizza originated in Napoli, Italy.  There, they set the bar for how pizza should be made.  Since then, \"pizza\" has been replicated in different ways but many have not followed the original guidelines.  So bottom line, unless it has a Vera certification of authenticity, it's not pizza.  The good news is that Settebello IS.  And, it's AWESOME.  What we ordered: Pizza Lasagna $11.99 Settebello Pizza $12.99 GET THIS! Awesome textures and flavor profiles Special Pizza with white figs and ricotta  In order to be true pizza, the ingredients and process have to be specific.  For example, the flour is imported from Napoli.  And it makes for a perfect crust.  Their crust has a bite to it, but it's not crispy or cracker-like.  It still maintains a doughy consistency, and I love that it's not bready.  Toppings are generous and are not overpowering.  Flavor combinations can be simple like a Margharita, but fear not foodies! They can also be very creative and different.  One thing I was skeptical about was that they don't use tomato sauce.  It's a no-no according to the Verace Association.  (Yup. They even have an organization to mandate pizza... they're hardcore!). Instead, they use crushed tomatoes which I found to be SOOO much better.  I want my pizza that way from now on thank you very much.  There are only a few Vera-certified pizza places around and can be found here: http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/shownaz.php?n=USA  Please de-virginize yourself if you have not yet tasted true pizza.   And if you're in the Las Vegas area, please make a visit to Settebello.  And tell your friends."}
{"text":"My first taste of Napoletana style pizza and a very good introduction. My server when I dine in has been Ryan, super friendly and knowledgeable. Can't go wrong here: Margherita DOC, the Settebello, and the Diavola were all delicious."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town!!! Really authentic italy style pizza.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Vegas to get real Italian pizza. Service is always great and the food never fails. Love it love it love it!"}
{"text":"Meh is right!  I wanted to like this little place, tucked away in the eastern end of the district with a cute atmosphere upon walk in and friendly staff i just wish the food followed through with similar positive marks. I wanted to use this place as a regular spot for work lunches in this region of town as its relatively in expensive for a lunch for two and its open and clean setting it seemed inviting enough. Its simple i ordered their Capricciosa pizza which was one of the 3 on the menu with two meats instead of the others with just 1 or less. The pie came out and it was what i expected with a very fresh looking feel to it and looked appetizing, and smelled pretty good as well. The best part of the pizza was the freshness of the vegetables that went on it, the sauce was just ok, and the crust was the weak part of the meal like others have said. Its just soggy and painfully not up to par for this type of pizza obviously. I really wish the management at this place would recognize that this is a common problem and try to improve upon it as i really want to like this place but cant return if there are so much better options to take my business.  Positive note the tiramisu is very good and is the reason this review for 3 instead of 2 stars. But then again im pretty easy to please when it comes to dessert, but arent we all."}
{"text":"Food was just ok, pricing was on the high side for the food and mostly the beer and wine. The real problem was the service. TERRIBLE!!! I never tip below 15% for so so service, but this waitress was really bad. It was not even that busy. She was trying to be conversational and witty to me in exchange for the bad service but it didn't work. I am sure with her good looks it worked on other customers, but not me. Bad first experience."}
{"text":"Must come back! Food is so freaking fresh and yummy! Loved loved loved the Caprese. The Settebello pizza was super awesome as well. Place is small and not as busy when I went (after lunch before dinner). Our waitress was friendly and always checked to see if everything was good. Another waiter came to fill my water when he saw it almost done. Looking forward to trying all their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas, and actually anywhere!   I always order the Diavola with poached egg, garlic, and uncut. When I get the pizza with the soft yolk, I break it and spread it all over the pizza like a sauce. Somehow yolks add a creamy flavor to things that cannot be imitated with anything else I know of....yummy. Don't forget to ask for the spicy olive oil to drench over your pizza. The housemade chili oil adds a great kick.   If you have leftovers and decide to take it home, warm it up in an oven or eat it cold. Microwaving would destroy the nice crusty crust.   Service either inside, at the bar or outside is always friendly. It really seems like the staff likes working here and with each other. This reminds me of my restaurant days."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences EVER! The pizza (both) were burned black around the top and spongy crust, our waiter said the beets were fresh (they were cubed and out of a can) and the coup de gras was when our bill came (total: $41.40) and our waiter gave us $58.00 back. When I drew it to his attention that he shorted us .60cents, his reply was:\"We don't do change!\" REALLY??? What does that mean? That you get to keep \"MY\" money??! Great racket you got going on buddy! .60 cents from every table turns into dollars of others money in your pockets! We own a restaurant too...if you were my employee I would fire you on the spot! We will NEVER eat there again and I will share this experience with EVERYONE!!!"}
{"text":"Just left happy hour and Marg. Monday's. Good eats, great drinks, cute bartender ;) All you need!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Settebello on my Vegas depature date(8/22/15) looking for a good meal relatively close to McCarran Airport.I was also conducting an experiment: Can you get anything close to the best of New York Pizza in the LV area? The answer is a resounding YES. It is a pleasant space with a bar and many selections of craft bear. I chose a Hennepin Ommegang. It was delicious and refreshing.My server, Justin, was friendly and helpful. He gave me a nice explanation of the menu. I chose the Settebello(picture is posted), generously topped with sausage, mushrooms and pine nuts. It was an exceptional pizza and reasonably priced at $14.00. Frankly, I liked it much better than the pizza I ate at Grimaldi's in Garden City, Long Island. Settebello is now on my \"to do\" list when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"They now have happy hour, it's an added bonus!  This place is close to our home and has delicious margerita pizza, which is what drives us in every time!  The service can vary from bad to good; last time our waitress hardly showed at our table but today our waiter checked in on us three times -showing improvement!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a place that my daughter and I both love to eat at.... My girl is 12yrs old and her diet consists of Pizza, Chicken Tenders, Fries and Pasta with white sauce. So because I am trying to eat healthy, those dishes do not say much for HEALTHY!!!  I love sushi  and sushi makes her wanna barf (-her words, not mine). Anyways, back to Settebello - we love it. The pizza just has to be a whole lot healthier than other pizzas, I don't know that for a fact but I totally feel it- call it women's intuition (Women are never wrong!!!)  Appetizers- Focaccia - Warm pizza dough topped with sea salt,oregano & Olive oil  Ruccola Salad-Arugola, Lemon, Olive oil, fresh ground pepper & Sea Salt I had the Marinara Pizza- Crushed Tomatoes,Olive Oil, Garlic & Oregano -NO CHEESE - My Daughter had the Margherita Pizza- Crushed Tomatoes, Oilve oil, Garlic, Mozzarella - WE ASKED FOR NO BASIL AND ADDED EXTRA CHEESE- Dessert- TOO FULL  but next time we did plan on trying the Nutella Pizza that is topped with of course - Nutella, Whipped Cream, bananas and almonds. Sounds Glorious....... I love that every ingredient is simple and minimal but still so flavorful and satisfying. I will take pizza from Settebello over any other pizza hands down. Finally I can enjoy pizza without feeling like I am clogging my arties because of all the fat that pizza is known for."}
{"text":"I'm starting to think I have weird taste buds. After reading the amazing reviews here as well as the rave reviews my mother in law had about the place, I had to give it a try. What can I say other than I was not impressed? Honestly, all the food was great...except for the pizza which was too bland for my liking.  We had the Margharita with mushrooms and the Settebello I think its called. Whatever it was, it was the last one on the menu with pine nuts on it. My husband and I were both adding, oil and vinegar, salt, pepper, red pepper, anything to give it more flavor. The pizza didn't taste bad, just tasted incomplete, like it was missing seasoning. The crust was probably the best part, crispy and chewy the way it should be. But once again, not much flavor.  However, I loved my peach bellini and the homemade tiramisu was among the best I've had, although I can't say I order it too often. The foccacia starter was tasty as well. But once again, we go back to the pizza; after all, it is a pizza place, shouldn't it be the star attraction? In my opinion, I'd go to Grimaldi's instead for much more flavorful pizza."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Walked in and was greeting by two employees. Great guys. One explained the menu and described one of his personal favorites. I ordered the Margherita DOC. I came out quick and It was delicious!!! Worth the drive from my hotel out to Henderson for sure!"}
{"text":"Not bad not great. Its more sizzle than steak. The portions are small and in reality not that great. The place on the inside has a bit of a hipster vibe, with the full bar, and music. The service there is good, and they seem very competent, and have that new school style of service.  The crust on the pizza is super thin which I like, and it has a sourdough taste to it which I also like, but its just kind of lacking in the size and flavor that I am looking for. I guess it could be a perfect lunch spot...pizza and a salad for 2."}
{"text":"Being from NY, there are only a handful of pizza places I have found in Henderson and Las Vegas I like :) This is one of them :)  Been here four times now, we have had.....The Foccaccia Bread, the Caprese Salad(really Good) and the Margherita and Marinara pizza.  All are excellent!  Each time I go here I try to try a new dish/ pizza.  The staff is really friendly also and its a kid friendly place.  Highly recommend trying Settebello!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype coming into this place for me. Their pizzas are brick oven and have a flaky crust. I enjoyed a beet salad for the first time and was also very impressed.  The best thing I had was the arugula wrapped in prosciutto. I definitely would get that again. Overall a great experience, however nobody will have my experience because I had a smoking hot date :)"}
{"text":"This quite possibly was the worst pizza I ever had. I cannot wrap my head around how this place has such good reviews. I ordered the bolognese pizza and the settebello. Took 40min to get pizza first off. The bolognese was disgusting. It was like eating soup pizza. Was basically raw dough in the middle. I had one slice of the bolognese and was done. The settebello was raw in the middle as well but not as bad as the bolognese. The waitress said the pizza was soft but I was not expecting raw pizza. Just a horrible texture. Bring your spoon to eat your pizza at this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went here for my birthday with my parents and everything was perfect. This place has no comparison to any pizza restaurant that I've had here in Las Vegas. My favorite is the Bianca pizza."}
{"text":"This place IS highly underrated. I tried it today for the first Time and was shocked how quiet it was in there considering how delicious our food was. We had the Diavola, the margherita, and the salami board. All only 5$ each on happy hour (3-6) and the portions were generous. The interior was so pretty and comfortable. The regular menu wasn't all that pricey either. It'd be a great date night spot or group dinner and even for kids. I would encourage more people to try it! In an excellent location in village square off Sahara and Fort Apache. Ill definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"It was a family night and I've been dying to try Settebello for the longest time and it just so happened I saw that there was one close to us. Away we went and we walked in and they had said they couldn't take credit card at that moment but luckily we had enough cash money to pay for the tab.  We started off with the buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto. It came with a pizza size bread type thing as well which was a little burnt. The mozzarella was delish and it went well with everything. I ordered the Bianca. I wasn't too impressed with it and since it was such a thin crust it got soggy pretty quickly. My husband ordered the Capricciosa. We weren't blown away by that either.   Overall service wasn't the quickest and most attentive (waited for more napkins for a good 10 minutes or so) but the credit card machine was back in working order. I wasn't too impressed and I'm not sure I'll be back when there's a lot of pizza places that I do love around! Sorry Settebello!"}
{"text":"Everything was great here. We went during their happy hour and everything was perfect and flawless. We ordered bunch of items from their menu, they were all delicious. The staff was very nice, prompt and it seemed like they all knew what they were doing- except for their busser  or their food runner, who kept asking us if we were done with our dish, and try to take it away. But it was okay since we were enjoying everything.   The bartender made sure to bring our wines on time. The server was friendly till the end. Definitely a hidden gem in Vegas, that people seem to be missing out, since the whole restaurant was empty when we were there-and it was happy hour."}
{"text":"Good Pizza, but very over priced.  Their claim to fame is they use New York water and flour from Italy. I did see the flour sacks, but honestly, it didn't make a difference.  I had the waiter bring me their \"best house\" pizza. It was no different than any other family style pizza in town.  Luckily, it was my friend's treat, or I would have felt that I had been taken.   I hate to admit it, but the $9.99 Costco extra large, with everything on it, is better. But if you are craving pizza and on a date, this place is a cut above California Pizza Kitchen, and they are nicer than Gramaldi's.   I have had Pizza in New York and it did seem better, but honestly, doesn't food taste better when you're visiting?  I still think Chicago has the best Pizza in the US."}
{"text":"it wasn't all that spectacular as all the reviews suggested which is the reason why I went. had the pizza carbonara and it wasn't bad, but it was great. the egg made it very soggy in the middle. also ordered the beet salad and it was just whatevers and kinda pricey ($9). also had the tiramisu and like I said, it wasn't bad but wasn't great either. the place was clean and staff was friendly. I just didn't see what all the 5 star rating was about. maybe I didn't order the right thing? if you go here you won't regret that you went, however there are other places that are comparable as well."}
{"text":"I've eaten pizza all over this country and have had some great pies and some really lousy ones too (yes you can have both bad sex and bad pizza). The pizza here is perhaps the best I've experienced ANYWHERE... If you love pizza, be sure to give this place a try it will make your top 5 pizzas list guaranteed..."}
{"text":"Wow. What can I say except the best pizza I have ever ever eaten in this country. Yes, it is that good. Trust me, this is how neapolitan pizza should be. They are true artisans. They are recognized by pizzaiolo association in Napoli, Italy. All of their ingredients are of the best quality and even sourced from Italy, i.e. cheese from Modena, prosciutto from Parma, tomatoes fromSan Marzano, etc. I think even thelour is from Naples.   All of the appetizers are delectable, bt my favorite is the involtini di proscuitto, prosciutto wrapped around arugula and goat cheese with a sprinkling of balsamic and some parm. Sublime. Theyoffer about 6 house made pizzas, but I always go with the margherita and two toppings. They recommend you limit it to two in order to savor it fully. This is how it should be, in my opinion. I usually get mushrooms and prosciutto crudo, it is the best!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for my first time today. Excellent pizza. Perfect portions for two. Fresh ingredients. Atmosphere was great. Will return!"}
{"text":"Can't believe people keep giving this place great ratings! I can make better pizza at home with my oven. LAS VEGAS. Please head to either Chicago or Detroit for great pizza that has depth and has big flavor. Pizza in Las Vegas sucks period. One place I want to mention is Home Plate Grill at Blue Diamond and Decatur. Lots better.   The pizza I had was 'The Settebello\". Very dry and had little toppings. Expensive and very small too. The only plus was the ingredients were quality ones but not many covered the pizza! Too much bread showing."}
{"text":"We just moved to LV from San Diego and wanted to find a replacement pizza with GF crust like the fantastic crust at LJ's Pizza on Pearl. Well, this gluten free crust is different but it's very good. Fast, efficient service and the waiter didn't say \"no problem\" instead of \"my pleasure\" but he did call us  \"guys\" ignoring gender. Oh well, everyone does that I guess these days. The caprese salad was perfect, served on a cold plate and the half margherita, half inferno was very nice, with the inferno living up to its name.   We will be back soon for regular crust and another of the 15 different pizzas."}
{"text":"If you enjoy pizza, you'll most likely enjoy Settebello. The pizza flavors are quite delicious... and are made with fine ingredients. The flavor profiles are amazing.   Happy hour is nice, as well. There are usually deals on drinks if that's your thing.   Also, my favorite aspect of this place is the desert. The nutella pizza is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Yum, but their Summerlin location is yummier.  Settebellos is your basic thin crust fancy pizza joint. They have a pretty consistent menu of pizza that does not change like the location in Summerlin does. The pizzas are thin, but big enough that you'll probably want to share a pizza with 2 people. Pizza with jalapeno marmalade: Yes, yes, yes. It's the perfect combo of sweet plus spicy and you won't regret your choice. The marmalade is just a light glaze on top, it does not replace the sauce.  Settebello Pizza: Heavy on the meat, lacking in flavor. It was just a regular thin crust pizza with heavy toppings, but nothing special. Skip it and go for something that stands out a little more.  The Summerlin location has a fig marmalade which beats the jalapeno. Can you guys put that on your menu too?!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. Had a nice lunch with pizza and had to take most it home. Great crust and great sauce!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Capricciosa with crushed tomatoes, prosciutto cotto, artichokes, mushrooms, olives, mozzarella and basil. I was with my students from Italy and they approved! They said that besides the pine nuts that it was very close to the pizza back home. They also ordered Canolli and Gelato for dessert. As an added bonus, it is close to my home. I will be back."}
{"text":"Settebellos is simply amazing! My favorite pizza in Las Vegas. It is truly Authentic Italian pizza at its finest. This restaurant offers amazing an amazing cocktail and wine selection. Many of their high quality ingredients are sourced from Italy. One pizza is enough for two people, however they do not offer half and half toppings. My personal favorites are the pizza bolognese and settebello. Expect a wait if dining in the evening as this place is very popular."}
{"text":"Nice servers and nice atmosphere, but pizza was not bad, but not that great.  Salads were good, but they use arugula lettuce so it was bitter.  It would not be my first choice to get pizza and drinks, but if someone else wanted to go or suggested it, I would go then.  Just kinda so - so.  I have only been once so far so maybe another pizza would be better.  Not bad at all, just kinda average."}
{"text":"I just had the pesto pizza. Yum! As always, the crust was perfect. And the pesto offered a great herby kick. This place remains the gold standard for pizza in Greater Las Vegas.  And the wine list is quite nice. I had a couple Moscatos to celebrate my coming birthday."}
{"text":"Great happy hour that goes later than most bars/restaurants. Good was delicious and not overpriced. That also have a great selection of beers and cocktails to choose from!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that I tried to overdose on the Settebello!  Ahhh the SAUSAGE!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing here! My favorites are the Quattro Fromagii or the Margherita DOC. They have a good wine list and great happy hour specials. Service is always great."}
{"text":"What a find! Thank you, fellow Yelpers, for the reviews on this place. We ordered the Pizza bologne and the Settebello. Delicious wood fire pizza, anyone? The crust was chewy and perfect and toppings were flavorful and fresh. Also, the best, hands down, tiramisu to be had for miles around. All in all, the price is so fair for the quality of food that comes to your table. The service was quite prompt, friendly, and helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  Doesnt matter what you get you'll enjoy it. Servers worked fast and made the wait time go by fast."}
{"text":"Amazing! The freshest ingredients and competitive prices. These are your classic thin crust pizzas, not lathered in sauce and toppings. Keep it simple with the wife's favorite, the Setebello, or go spicy like me and snatch up the diablo!   Dine in or take out, you will always have fast and efficient service. We're regulars already and don't see any stopping in the future!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Where to start? Yum, yum and more Yum! Talk about real Italian food and amazing pizza, this is the place you want to visit! Try their happy hour pizza specials and appetizers from 3-6 I think! Amazing food, quality fresh ingredients that make your mouth water in anticipation! Staff is always friendly and the location is clean and very inviting. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Italian style restaurant located in The District shopping area.  We came on a Friday night and it was very busy. The waitstaff was attentive and friendly.  I started with the sangria which was great. We ordered the meatballs for an appetizer and I was underwhelmed. One of the meatballs was burnt. For our meal we had the margherita pizza. It was undercooked and cold after 5 minutes.  I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good but the flavor was ruined by having burned crust on the under side.  The blackened dough pretty much destroyed the experience.   After we complained they offered to remake one of our pizzas. The second was better but still blackened. The Nutella pizza was awesome and so was the gelato.  We drove from the strip and I felt it was a waste of time considering all that is offered on the strip."}
{"text":"This oven backed neopolitan pizza is unique and super good .... Love the one with the brisket....."}
{"text":"Finally found the BEST pizza in Las Vegas.  As close to real Italian pizza as you can get.  Prices are appropriate as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, 100% authentic, probably one of the best in Las Vegas. Everything else was just as good. Tyler took great care of us as we had a large party with the Ferrari Club. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The pizza was great, specially the Margarita and Veggie  one, but the atmosphere was may friendly!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in town.  The one I get most often is the quattro fromagio, the balance in the cheeses acidity of the tomato sauce and fragrant basil they use makes it anything but boring.  All the ingridients are so fresh and high quality.  If you are someone who needs a super crispy or thick crust it might not be for you.  It is generally easier to eat this with a fork and knife and quickly (which is not hard for me lol) because it can get on the softer side after a certain point.  I have found that if I have a left over slice you can just throw it on a frying pan at home and cover it.  It will allow the cheese to melt and crisp the crust back up.  Their sangria is also great, super refreshing.  The nutella pizza is big! I recommened getting it if you have a large group to share.  I used to love their panna cotta when it was made with cut up strawberries rather than a strawberry thats pureed into an over acidic sauce that takes over the whole dish.  They have a lemon type dessert that is light and lovely as well.  Their tirimisu is not the best I have had, it was a little dry actually.  Overall all though I do love their food, especially the pizza.  Sometimes they have a special bolgunese pizza I highly recommened.  Also a tip, if its super busy and they have no tables just go to the bar, it usually has some spots opened and its sectioned off a bit from all the other people."}
{"text":"We were in need of a quick bite before seeing a special movie event at the Regal Theatre. We spotted this place and thought we'd give it a try.   The wood-burning oven and wood pile in the dining room gives the whole place a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Our server, Bethany, gave us a nice overview of the menu and explained their style of pizza - Napoleon - and also briefed us on the Happy Hour specials.   We were pleased that they had $5 mini-pizzas on the Happy Hour menu since we saw several pizzas (all 12 inches only) on the regular menu that we would like to try. I opted for the Diavola and Hubby got the Emilia with red sauce instead of white. We also ordered a couple of drinks but nothing special. They did seem to have a nice selection of wines and beers and we will definitely explore this next visit when we have more time.  The pizzas arrived timely and looked delicious. Like another reviewer stated, the thin crust is crisp on the outside edges but soft in the middle. It almost seems to form a \"bowl\" as it bakes which causes this. I personally found it to be fine. What I was disappointed with was the taste. Everything was fresh but bland. I had to add salt (which I NEVER do, especially to pizza!) and red pepper flakes to give it flavor. There was certainly nothing \"Devilish\" about the Diavola!! Hubby enjoyed the Emilia and said next time that he would like to try the Settebello.   We will come back when we have more time and try some different menu items for sure!"}
{"text":"Settebello has good wood fired pizza, we have been many times and usually go back about once a month. The only bad pizza we had was a special with raspberry jam on it, sooo bad! They will serve you a whole uncut pizza unless you ask for it to be cut and sometimes I forget this, it makes me wonder why? I guess that is how they do it in the old country or something, every restaurant needs it's little twist, but that is kind of annoying. I think they should do the opposite and serve it cut and ask if you want it whole! Two individual pizzas, split a salad and a soft beverage and your at $50 for two, just seems expensive for pizza, maybe that is from my childhood pricing! I would give three and a half stars if I could, just not four star worthy."}
{"text":"The two star \"I've experienced better\" rating is more than apt in this instance.  The decor of Settebello is very nice and the ovens are cool to look at. It's really easy to get all jazzed about the wood fired oven and unique toppings and flavor combinations. Hell, the website does enough boasting about how original and special the restaurant is. But it all comes down to the food and this pizza just was not good.  At the most basic level your margherita pizza should be the star. And it wasn't. The crust was flavorless and overcharred. Here's my unecessarily lengthy analogy: You know when you make grilled cheese (and c'mon, everyone makes 2 at a time, how could you eat just one?) and the first one comes out perfect but the second one comes out kinda messed up because the pan is probably too hot and there's not enough butter to help the bread brown correctly and the cheese doesn't fully melt because the thing is going to burn if you leave it on any longer? Well this is how my pizza was, it seemed hastily cooked over too high heat and lacked flavor. Not to mention the sauce was bland and the cheese was amorphous and too stringy. There was exactly one basil leaf on my pizza too and it was burnt to a crisp. All in all, a poor excuse for something so full of itself. Needless to say I was disappointed in a major way with this whole thing."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese plate only after I asked if it would come out first before my meal. The waiter said it would if I ordered it without the bread. Well, the cheese plate came out at the same time as my margarita pizza. The margarita pizza was incredibly greasy with little to no fresh basil. The pizza was also soggy. Very disappointed in my meal. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Real Italian pizza, but the best thing I like is how the management solves issues. Outstanding service."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I wandered in here on a whim in search of pizza. Oh boy, what a joy to find! While slightly more expensive and will probably be considered a treat, this place was amazing.   We showed up for a late lunch, and our waiter was so very helpful. He told us about the history of their pizzas, how they're quite authentic.   We ordered two pizzas. A regular pepperoni and a chicken something or another. Both were delicious. Four slices for what looked like a 7-8 inch pizza. With both pizzas, for the two of us... Filling. Great find, but the prices are a bit steep."}
{"text":"Best pizza that we've had in Vegas in a long time- very authentic. Reminds me of New York. Margherita was awesome! And the Jalapeno Pear was a different take but very tasty- a little on the spicy side with the salami so be forewarned if you have issue with spicy food - two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"More than impressed. The service was outstanding and the food was great as well. Our server made awesome recommendations and the wait staff and everyone was very accommodating to our party. The meat selection of the meat & cheese appetizer as well as the focaccia was also quite delicious! Best ham and pepperoni I've har anywhere. Cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I recently ate here for the second time and don't know why I haven't been coming here more often. I really enjoyed my dinner and the prices even more.   The menu has so many great options. I finally decided on the Diavola pizza. The crust was perfect, spice level was perfect, and the amount of toppings was perfect. The ingredients all tasted high quality and fresh as well. Definitely no complaints on this option.   My husband had the Carbonara pizza and added sausage. He loved that they offer additional toppings, especially his favorite, extra meat. Again, everything was perfect with this pizza as well.  I loved the portion of the pizza. My husband was hungry so for him the size was perfect for one meal. I opted to eat half here and save the other half for leftovers the next night. The thin crust pizza makes a nice meal without feeling like you are overeating.   Settebello is a great weeknight option as well. We rarely eat out on weeknights because of time constraints, but Settebello was quick getting our food out. I love that I have a spot to eat on weeknights without spending too much time.  We were really impressed when the check came out. Pricing is more than reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian Pizzeria. I love Pizzs so I like to try different kinds. This is from Napoli so it's not crispy. Tell tale signs of Pizza Napoletana."}
{"text":"Love the thin, slightly burnt crust =) We ordered the settebello & capricciosa. Reminds me of the pizza I had when I was in Milan. Super fresh and tasty. Sometimes it's nice to eat pizza with a knife and fork. They also have the blood orange san pellegrino here.. so it's a nice little treat to complement the pizzas.  I really like the surrounding area. It's nice to take a stroll post-meal to sneak in a small workout."}
{"text":"so i lived in Italy and this is the closest that i can find. All my friends who fly in have to go here 1st. Love the pizza here and everything else.  only down point would be no frozen liter mugs of beer!! LOL"}
{"text":"So when we first came here, it wasn't bad. This place actually had such a great environment, not to mention the food was pretty good as well. But this time was very different. When we entered the restaurant, the environment was completely different. The waitress blinked a few times, almost walked away, and then reluctantly greeted us. I didn't think much of it. I just thought maybe she was busy, but when I looked around, it was pretty empty. Anyways she acted pretty hostile which made me sort of feel unwelcome. I ended up forgetting about it cause maybe she had a tough day. UNTIL. There was a family behind us with the same server and she was so nice to them! Like she was literally laughing and smiling and it's like she was a completely different person! When she brought us the food, she didn't even get the order right. We ordered 3 pizzas and instead she brought us 4. She thought since we had another guest coming that we would want an extra one EVEN THOUGH we said nothing of the sort. Of course the food was good as usual but the waitress basically ruined my experience."}
{"text":"Maybe the 3-star rating isn't quite fair. Read a bunch of reviews on this place and just had to try it out. Have counted on Yelper's opinions since discovering this place living in San Francisco. Anyways, there's a particular style of pizza I'm searching for, and thought this might be it. For anybody that  grew up in Oregon, and was raised on Pietros, Abby's, Shakey's, etc they know the kind of pizza I'm seeking. Usually I've been able to locate at least one in most big cities, like Village Host in the Bay Area, but the search is long. When the crisp, thin flatbread crust was described here, I had to try them out. It's exactly what I'm searching for.  I liked the pizza, and the service was great. The only drawback was (and it's probably not anybody's fault but my own), it seems I don't really love authentic Naples pizza. There was too much olive oil on it,  and the basil was overbearing.  Loved the crust, and the sausage, and the sauce. Service was outstanding, and the price reasonable. Just not my place exactly. I'm looking for a Shakey's-style pizza (if it can be found in this city). Anybody knows of one, or runs across one please let me know. Certainly that place is somewhere in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best pizza in Las Vegas. They make their gluten dough in house, excellent.  From  NY, been to Italy. I know my pizza. If you want quality go here."}
{"text":"The Pizza at Settebello was awesome!  We had two pizzas and both were perfect combos in my book.  The Settebello and the Cappicola.  I'll attach a picture later.  They also have happy hour with discounted drinks and food.  If I was a local, I would definitely hit this place up for HH, sit at the bar and watch an NBA game.  The service was nice from the host to servers to bussers etc.  Very reasonable prices for high quality pizza (see their menu).  Extensive drink list.  I was extremely satisfied with my Settebello pizza experience!"}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Staff was very friendly and accommodative. Kids loved it too. We had the meatballs, arugula salad and 2 pizza. All was simply awesome. Oh and the Panna Cotta was absolutely amazing too. The place gets busy so be prepared to wait a bit to be seated."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust VPN certified pizzas!  We returned to california and longed for the VPN pizzas.  We found a restaurant in marina del rey that was VPN certified, and it sucked.  Can't wait for Settebello to open their location in Pasadena this fall!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place the pizza was fresh and tasted just like it did when I lived in Italy.  This is going to be my new go to Pizza place."}
{"text":"One of the best places in town for a proper pizza. Service is casual and friendly. though the wine list is neglected, they could offer much better wines at the same price point. Hope to see some changes in this area."}
{"text":"This seems to be one of the better pizza places in the metro LV area, and even though it was out in Henderson, if you have a car, it's worth the trip out there. They had great individual 12\" pizzas fried in a brick oven, plenty enough for even a hungry person. Good pizza, Neapolitan style. My only criticism is that my crust was a little limp, and I had to hold it with two hand to keep my toppings from sliding off, so I recommend asking them to leave it in the oven a little extra to get a firmer crust."}
{"text":"Visited Settebello for a dear friend's birthday. She wanted to try it so bad that it made ME excited. I must say at the end of the evening here is what went wrong:  1. The service was curt, though polite, and when I asked for a suggestion she nearly rolled her eyes and said, \"everythings' good.\" For a place serving true Napoli pizza, I was surprised that it seemed the wait staff didn't take more pride in their product. I settled on the Margherita.   2. We ordered our food slightly behind a LARGE party. Though I am understanding and don't mind waiting for my food, knowing the chefs need to make things in order, I am discouraged from returning from the HOUR WAIT. My friend was getting tipsy from her martini sitting on an empty stomach.   3. The ingredients were fresh, delicious, amazing in their flavors and textures. However my friend ordered a pizza with Italian Sausage on it. In her entire pizza there were FOUR SLICES of tiny sausage on it. I get it that your ingredients are imported. But we didn't pay $15 for a pizza to get FOUR slices of sausage.   My lemon drop martini and friends glass of wine were wonderful. The pizzas tasted like heaven. But price and portion size made me wish we'd gone to Grimaldi's. And I'm sure my waitress was embarrassed from our long wait time because she never offered dessert."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with a group of 10 people. We started off with drinks at the bar as we waited for everyone to get there. The bar service was slow...really slow. I do hate to bash bar service, because it's quite often a staffing problem, not a speed problem with the bartender. I waited 15 minutes to get my first drink, which my friend ordered for me before I even got there. The poor bartender was crazy busy until another bartender finally joined her. They were both super friendly. My guess is, they usually staff more bartenders earlier on in the nights for Fri, Sat, Sun.  When we were ready for food, they smartly moved us into a private dining area with glass doors. This was a wise decision on their part. This IS a family establishment as well, and some in our group were getting a tad rowdy. Good to move to keep everyone happy.   The pizza was phenomenal. We ordered the gluten free crust and it was, hands down, the best gluten free crust I have had. I actually was super skeptical it was even gluten free, so I had to ask what was in it.   We did have a little mix up with the bills at the end due to our switching from the bar to the dining area.   All in all, great time here. Props to the staff here for letting us ourselves while maintaining a family atmosphere for the rest of the customers."}
{"text":"My husband ordered me a gluten free pizza to go on a Monday night at 7:30pm. They said it would be 10 minutes so he left the house and was literally back in 15 the transaction was so quick! Pizza was delicious, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was fooled into trying this place again. Thanks Eater 38 list.  I originally tried this chain in Pasadena and was really disappointed in my pizza, which lacks flavor.  This time knowing that this place (rated top pizza in Eater 38 Las Vegas), I ordered a meat pizza.   My pizza was definitely much better than my previous experience at their Pasadena location.   Note: This is probably how authentic Neopolitan pizza (as they are certified) is supposed to taste like as they use Italian ingredients such as flour and Marzano tomatoes.  Don't think I'll come back when there's Secret Pizza at the Cosmo!  I prefer New York-style pizza over Italian Neopolitan pizza."}
{"text":"Reviews live up to the expectations of this place!one of the best  Vegas has to offer!   Thin crust that's made fresh when ordered. You can't go wrong with any pizza from the menu."}
{"text":"I've been craving Italian pizza with a homemade thin crust and fresh mozzarella.... And the pizzas here totally satisfied my craving!   We ordered the Diavola (basil, garlic, red peppers, gooey fresh mozzarella, marinara sauce) and the Capricciosa (prosciutto, artichokes, olives, mushrooms, basil, mozzarella, marinara sauce). They were both soooo very delicious! the crust was perfect- thin, but still doughy and the end of the crust was crisp. And the ingredients were so fresh with that melted mozzarella on top and the marinara sauce had good flavor. I want to go back to try the others and the get the Nutella dessert pizza!"}
{"text":"Walked right in and was seated immediately. Staff were prompt and took my order quickly. The atmosphere is very open, and homely as music fills the room. The faint whisps of pizza cooking is faint...smells good....and of course delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place last night. I think we've been holding off because we thought it was going to be expensive, but it really isn't. 2 salads, a pizza and a cocktail came to roughly $40.   The food is excellent and the pizza is very different than we're used to but very fresh and delicious (and the sauce is amazing!). The crust is really thin, airy and light, but not hard, crunchy or crispy like you might expect a thin crust to be.  We had the Diavola pizza which had crushed tomatoes, garlic, basil, bell peppers, peppered salami, crushed red peppers, etc. So incredibly flavorful and delicious. What's really amazing is that you taste every single topping. It's like hearing an orchestra where you can isolate and identify every single instrument yet still appreciate the cohesive whole that they become.   We also had the warm beets (served simmering in a cast iron pot smothered in garlic, oil and Marcona almonds) and the Insalata, both of which were delicious.   For the drink we shared the Triple B. Bourbon, Balsamic Reduction, muddled strawberries, lemon juice, and a few other ingredients that I can't quite recall. My wife said it reminded her of a scented candle... Not sure I agree but we both thought it was great!   The atmosphere is also nice. Comfortable, cozy, warm and inviting with a nice energy. This is definitely a place that we'll come back to.  UPDATE: We've been back 3 more times now and we've never gotten the same dish twice, we always try something new. We have yet to be disappointed! Everything we've had has been delicious. We've also taken friends and family for the first time who promptly went back again to try other items."}
{"text":"I love their pizza!!! The whole \"my eyes are bigger then my stomach\" thing takes place and then (at Settebello's) after the \"just one more bite, okay now just ONE more bite...\" my delicious pizza has vanished into digestive bliss."}
{"text":"I got to say that this place is pretty good!! I order jalapeño margarita (not on menu) special made and it was delicious..  We shared a salad Panzanella, it was very flavorful and fresh.  For main course we shared the Special pizza inferno; crushed tomatoes , coppa, jalapeños and Serrano peppers, pans cream mozzarella cheese, basil and olio.. wow!! It was delicious!!!! For dessert I order tiramisu and a latte!! Overall it was outstanding!  Patrick was our server and did a good job!  Thanks again for the delicious food and great service:))"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza to go which took about a minute to bake.  They had one size pizza (12\" pizza) that ranged from $8.50-$13.50.   I was a little disappointed that they did not offer Ricotta Cheese on their pizza.   They were located on S Green Valley Parkway in Henderson, NV.  I ordered the Settebello Pizza which had Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The pizza was sliced for the to go order.  The bones were soft, chewy and charred.  Yum!   I will be back to dine in."}
{"text":"Fantastic, see my review for the Sahara location below.  The biggest difference between this location and the one on Sahara is that this one has some pretty amazing gelato. The Dream Bomba is amazing (chocolate-covered peanut butter gelato, wrapped around a caramel core). And I always like to finish my meals here with a lovely affogato (a scoop of vanilla gelato, topped with freshly brewed espresso) - divine.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-las-vegas?hrid=P1cKU1NcOs1WOHb5vka5xA"}
{"text":"This is probably some of the best pizza in Las Vegas. If you are looking for New York-style, pan crust or Sicilian, then this place is not for you. You'll be getting the real-deal kind of pizza, as it is served in Naples.  The insalata is simple and satisfying. I usually stick to the margherita pizza, as it never disappoints. My boyfriend loves the arancini as well.   This location is quite larger than its Henderson counterpart, and the furniture and tables (including lighting and bar) are equal parts rustic and gorgeous.  The only drawback to this location (as opposed to one in Henderson) is that they don't serve gelato. Other than that, it's not far from my house and I don't have to go to all the way to Henderson when I'm jonesin' for Settebello anymore."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! If I was just judging the quality of food and flavored this review would be very different... That being said the service is awful. So inattentive and unapologetic it's hard to want to go back for the delicious pizzas. An early dinner with friends turned into a two and a half hour debacle of some of the worst service I've ever had. Order to go, and enjoy the meal in your own home. Or make sure when you go you have all the time in the world and the patience of a saint."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was delicious!!! My husband and I enjoyed every bite. Will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Call me a contrarian, but I just don't get why this place has such good reviews.  I'm a New Yorker by birth and upbringing, and many would agree that New York has *the* best pizza.  But pizza came to the U.S. via Naples.  Settebello's explanation of why their pizza is small, soggy, and salty doesn't add up.  We got there just before the late HH was about to end, so we ordered a wine and beer.  Six bucks for a draft beer pint is not my idea of happy hour pricing, unless maybe you're on the Strip.  But we weren't.  The small HH menu listed individual pizzette for $5 each.  We asked our waiter if we'd get more if we ordered the regular pizza off the regular menu.  \"Definitely,\" he said.  So we did, assuming that it would be a normal pizza and we'd have leftovers.  I love leftovers.  Until we were presented with what usually passes for happy hour-sized pizza at other places.  And then watched as a man dining near us got his individual pizza, and realized we'd been had.  Two of those would have given us as much, or more than the one we got.  The waiter's response was that he guessed he'd made a bad call.  Yeah, real bad. I can't even remember the last time we didn't tip a waiter.  And that was before we each took a tiny slice of the drooping, sloppy \"big\" pie.  Salty.  Flavorless.  Four bites and it was gone.  The manager admitted that the Neapolitan style wasn't to everyone's taste, and offered to get us something else.  We declined, and simply finished our drinks and went down the street to Khoury's.  Now that was worth the four stars I'll be giving it. And next time we want pizza, we won't be going back to Settebello.  So utterly disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little Italian Pizza place that doesn't try and Americanize their pizza. It's straight up, delicious Italian pizza. Thin crust, not overloaded with cheese, it has real vegetables, and artichokes, delicious artichokes. (I mean you could order a pizza without artichokes, but why would you). You're either going to love it, or hate it. It's not pizza hut, and it doesn't pretend to be. You're getting an authentic experience here. If you're in the mood for some delicious Italian pizza, this is your spot, best in Vegas."}
{"text":"I obsess over their diavolo pizza - it is absolutely delicious! The panzanella salad is great too. The only thing I have had here that I was not happy with was the brisket pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place! Usually I prefer thicker crust pizzas, but the brisket pizza here is utter perfection just as it is. I honestly couldn't believe how tasty it was. The dessert pizza with Nutella and strawberries was also great.  I tried my first Moscow Mule here. Wasn't a fan of the drink, but I dig that they have the proper mule cups."}
{"text":"Always awesome service. Happy hour is excellent. Authentic Italian pizza. My fave is the carbonara and the insalata grande salad"}
{"text":"This is purely a statement about the manager at end of the bar on your phone. Get info ur phone! 30 plus minutes just pokemon'ing away...."}
{"text":"I've given it a shot twice now to give a fair review. Both times it tasted fine, but the crust is just a thin wet layer of sog. I mean it's the equivalent of eating a tasty bread bowl of soup. The bottom part of the bread bowl. We asked for it more toasty and we got the same thing with crispy black edges.  For the price, wouldn't return. Oh well."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good, overall atmosphere of the restaurant was not good.  Was extremely hot inside, I don't think there was any ac running, and no blinds on the front door so intense sun glare for most the meal.  Overall not a nice dinning experience."}
{"text":"Lived in Rome, Italy for 3 years, traveled extensively throughout Italy. This is the best place for Italian food that I have eaten in the U.S. Most places only resemble Italian food. There is also a location in Vegas. Highly recommend . Some great deals are offered during happy hour."}
{"text":"So delicious! Fresh salads with the best prosciutto and thin soft pizzas!  Their variety of \"mule\" drinks during happy hour are a must!! Don't miss the Nutella dessert pizza. Amazing.  The bar is a cool place to hang out too."}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice restaurant. We ordered their specialty and the Settebello. Both were good but one was a little more charred than I liked. They get four stars because the customer service felt robotic."}
{"text":"This place is a must-go! I was in Henderson visiting my parents who live in Green Valley Ranch area, and had heard great things before finally trying Settebello. We were so happy with our pizzas...I got the Emilia, and at first was weirded out by corn on pizza but you can't even taste it. So light and buttery. Delicious. My husband got the pizza with brisket, it was so different and tasty. My Mom got the pizza with mushroom and artichoke, and my Dad got the margherita pizza. I couldn't choose a favorite; they were all so fresh and unique. Even the traditional margherita was amazing and tasted like it came from Italy. We started off with the salad with artichoke hearts and lots of freshly grated cheese. I also got the nutella pizza for dessert, which was the one dish I didn't care for. And the drinks! I got the spicy pepper mule, and it was just the right amount of heat. I can't wait to go back the next time we are in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I like good food, I don't like BS answers and that is what I got today from our server.  The food here is actually really good and worthy of a 4 or 5 star rating normally.  My wife ordered the Settebello Pizza which comes with the house made sausage amongst other items.  I ordered the Diavola and asked to add the house made sausage.  Both pizza's came and in looking at hers, it had big chunks of sausage all over her pizza and looked really good.  I got charged $2.50 to add on the sausage and was VERY disappointed.  3/4 of the pizza had very little sausage on it and the other 1/4 had absolutely NONE.   I told the waiter and he responded with they use a spoon so its not like they tried to give her more then you.  REALLY???  Just looking at the two you can tell there was a difference and to be charged an extra $2.50 for something they just did not deliver on and to have the server respond like that,  I probably would not be going back here for some time.  I can get a better deal for my money then getting cheated and then treated like and fool by the waiter.  This place does not have my vote and even though the food is good, the value especially when charged extra is NOT worth the price.  If you are going to charge $2.50 for add on's, they should equal or exceed what you are charging."}
{"text":"It is amazing how bad the service is at Settebello's. I love this food, love coming here but the service is a joke.  45 minutes for a thin pizza?  Watching other tables get silverware, menus, olive oil and the list goes on, it's a free for all self serve.  We will no longer sit in Natalie's section.  Kind as she is, you ask for a roll up or napkins and good luck ever getting it... ever.  It's a shame how long this continues, but I will continue to come back because driving across town to east side Settebello's is just too far."}
{"text":"??????????????Pizza????????? TV.  ???????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This is truly my favorite pizza restaurant. The pizza is on the light side. You don't feel stuffed in pizza. Its quiet enough to enjoy a conversation. The president ordered from here when he was in town."}
{"text":"Well, I had a date to meet up there since I never eaten there before but of course, this guy flake out.. nevertheless, I decided to invite one of my gay hubby out for dinner later that day just because I read the good reviews about this place and I wanted to try!   Wow, this was the first time I tried authentic Italian style pizza (I had settabello, which is my favorite). I love the crust, how some part are slightly burnt but I love the flavor of it. The center of pizza got bit soggy yet chewy crust. My friend had other one that had olives, I forgot the name but the amount of olives placed on there tasted overwhelming. We also had caprese, of course, that is always delicious with balsamic vinegar but I could make this at home!   I'll be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Just had a Gluten Free Divola. I think it was the best Pizza I've ever had and I've eaten tons of pizza before I found I couldn't eat gluten. Amazing amazing amazing."}
{"text":"Worst pizza in Vegas at this price. Mediocre service. And I'm almost positive \"burned\" isn't a flavor. And pizza snobs, save it. I lived in Italy for a year and no self respecting Italian, from Napoli or anywhere else, would eat this garbage. How bad was it?  They didn't even ask how it was.  The only plus was when I finally got a managers attention they looked at the pizza and took it off my bill."}
{"text":"Visitors to town and the server Tyler was extraordinary. The food was pretty damn good too"}
{"text":"It took me awhile to get to this place but I finally did and I sure am glad I walked in THIS week!!!  The special was made for me and these come and go...  I sat at the bar...the bartender tells me they NEVER have chicken on pizza so it is my lucky day (most pizzas do have pork so I would have built my own if the special did not exist)...  so my special pizza had...chicken marinated in serrano peppers, lime, honey, onions and garlic on a white pizza (no sauce) - mozzarella and parmesan, with fresh basil and AVOCADO...yes!!!!  I have had cooked avocado-potato pizza at Star in Houston but they put fresh avocado on top...  honestly, I loved the heat (serrano slices on pizza and I added red chile flake) and the way the crust tasted...so thin in middle but the outer crust was so delish I kept dipping it in the minimal chicken juices left on the plate.  I finished the whole thing.  I hope they put that on the menu permanently. MMMM! - see pics!  UPDATE 6/1/10: The last 2 times I have been (see pics) I have ordered unusual things - I added lemon slices to one of the pizzas, and last time I got the pizza bianco and subbed bresaola for the prosciutto - I saw that the list of toppings did not include bresaola but they had it on a salad.  It is cured beef similar to prosciutto but a good sub for non-pork-eaters.  They did not charge extra and it was yummy (needed a squeeze of lemon that came with my tea for acid)."}
{"text":"We must have been there on an off day. I just dont get all the raves, I have lived in Italy and I  know anybody trying to serve a pizza like Settebello would never stay in business for long. First order is a good dough - Settebellos dough I suspect is frozen, low gluten, the same stuff white bread is made out off.  Sure they blister it nicely before serving, but it has no flavor, the crust alone taste like hot dog buns. There is not a hint of good quality olive oil on the crust and the crust comes to the table with the middle so soggy it was gross.  The crust was so mushy we had to ask for a fork scrap off the ingredients and eat them solo - the crust simple was not for human consumption and stayed on the plate - a gummy mess. The top ingredients are for the most part good, cheese is good, not so much the sausage, but that is a matter of individual taste. We had wine which comes in silly tiny non stem glasses. The wine list is okay, nothing interesting or ambitious, but then again it befits everything Settebello stands for. We did not have the courage to try the desserts after seeing them on a table next to us having been left half eaten. Would we go back,? No,of course not - the search for a good pizza in LV goes on."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza I have and will probably ever have in my life.  I am a longgggg time fan of Settebello. This authentic Neapolitan style restaurant offers the most tasty apps, pizzas, desserts, you name it. I'm at one of their many locations at least twice a month. (It's a long drive for me, but it's MORE than worth it).   My FAVORITE appetizers are the misto (a sampling of the most delicious focaccia bread, Italian meats, cheeses, and veggies like artichokes and olives) and the involtini: prosciutto wrapped arugula with goat cheese and balsamic. YUM!  My FAVORITE and in my opinion, the best pizza, is the Diavola. Garlic, finochionna (spicy salami), red bell peppers, and the most mouth watering margherita style sauce, mozzarella, and crust you will ever have.   Dessert: Dream Bomba. Chocolate coated peanut butter and vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel and chocolate fudge. So awesome!   Service is always outstanding. They are people who really care about you, your dining experience, and who always welcome you with open arms into the Settebello home!   If you're looking for somewhere uptight, please do not dine here. This is a place for happy people who love great food, great service, a relaxed environment, and superior standards.   Mangia!"}
{"text":"Fortunately discovered a place serving delicious gluten-free pizza. Mine had prosciutto, artichokes, olives, etc on it. Glass of red wine, okay. Friend had regular pizza and bottled beer. We shared a psalm that had a delicious dressing on it. Why not 5 star? If there were cloth napkins, warmer air temperature in the place, some draft beers and better wine for the price....then I would jump it to 5....but 4 was good and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to see that they expanded the appetizer section of the menu from my last visit. The artichoke crostini with speck and goat cheese was great, nicely toasted bread  with appropriate chew and moisture. Beet salad and meatballs were awesome as usual. Did the pizza of the week, and was not disappointed. Just need the busser to clear plates and glasses between courses more regularly, it adds up quickly when they are this good!"}
{"text":"Our family has a pizza place that we usually go to but one evening we decided to try something new. I heard great things about Settebello so that was where we headed. The restaurant has a dim romantic vibe to it, which didn't really suit us that evening since we had our 4 year old.   I ordered a caprese salad that was delicious but nothing I couldn't make at home.   My bf got us an appetizer to share. It was delicious, but I had recently got my braces put on, so hard crusty bread was not my friend. I had a SMALL bite of it and from what I remember, it was delicious. I believe it had artichoke, prosciutto, and ricotta (?)  I forget all the toppings that his pizza included, but I DO remember that the center of each pizza (our son got a regular, kid-sized, cheese pizza) was soggy :( The sauce was delicious but a little too thin.   The service was quaint and I remember our waitress mixing the two juices that our son couldn't decide on together, which he thought was pretty neat.   I don't know if we'll be back only because we've already got a favorite pizza place, but the experience was nice."}
{"text":"Settebello's is a pizza place that offers you the thin crust wood fired pizza. The pizzas are about 12\" and are usually more than enough for one person. There are about 8 different pizzas on the menu that are about $13 each. You can add items to the pizza, but you could end up paying quite a bit for a 12\" pizza, depending on what you add of course. Extra items start at $1 and then go up from there. The menu also consists of salads and appetizers to go along with the pizzas. They have a comfortable dining area with bench style seats, chairs, and booths that are set around wood tables. It is a Rustic decor that goes along with the menu.  We ordered a couple of salads. The Romana Salad and the Beet Salad. Both salads were okay. The arugula was fresh. The beet salad had red and yellow beets. They beets tasted like they were from a can. There was very little cheese on both salads.  We ordered three pizzas and added some items on each pizza. I know now that this type of pizza is known for being a bit soggy towards the middle of the dough after reading about it. I'm not a fan of soggy pizza.  Quattro Formaggi Pizza. I added mushrooms and calamata olives. The pizza was cooked nice and crisp, but the middle was soggy and I could not pick up the slice with out everything falling off.  Marinara Pizza. I added mushrooms, peppers, and onions. This pizza was cooked slightly less than the Quattro and was also soggy in the middle.  Margherita Pizza. I added olives, mushrooms, and artichoke. This pizza dough was under cooked and not at all crispy.  The cooking of the pizzas were very inconsistent. We had three pizzas for one table that were all cooked for different amounts of time, unless their oven was not distributing the heat properly.  The service was excellent. The waitress was very nice. I'm going to cut the pizza maker some slack this time. Their air conditioner was broken and he was cooking by a 900 degree oven. He looked very unhappy, which is quite understandable. So I'll go back again and try the pizzas when it is not a sauna in there.  The bill was $71 for 3 pizzas, 2 salads, and 3 beverages. A bit pricy for what I received. I will give them another try though, because the pizzas would be pretty good if they would have been cooked a bit longer. ******************************************************** Okay. Here is the update. I went back today to give them another try and got a couple pizzas to-go.  Much better. The pizzas were cooked perfect and they were not soggy at all. I figured they were having a problem the first time I was there because their power kept going out.  So, I would definitely recommend this place if you enjoy wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few of my friends.  They have a great lunch deal where you can get specialty pizza for 9 dollars and a salad for 4 dollars.  Environment: located in the district near Whole Foods. It is in a pretty busy area. The restaurant itself is pretty small and cute with cool Italian design. They also have a bar area where you can sit as well.  Service: the service was great, the staff were really friendly and were pretty quick about getting or orders in and bringing them out.  Food: I got the lunch special with the beet salad. The salad is so delicious with fresh beets. They give you the red and orange ones and well dressed arugula salad. I ordered the brisket pizza. It was good with melted white cheese and brisket beef with onions. I do feel that the pizza gets kind of soggy in the middle which was a little unpleasant. The crust though taste great if you dip it in vinaigrette. My friends all got the setebello pizza which was good as well. I do feel like it had a lot on it also making it pretty soggy, but it could be because of the rustic dough they use.   Overall, good lunch spot with a good pizza deal and salad. The only drawback for me with the soggy center of the pizza."}
{"text":"I found this place by pure luck and YELP of course. My son's class was the down the street, when I decided to do a search for pizza and Settobello popped up. The reviews were excellent, pictures looked delicious. We took a gamble, and it was a great choice. We ordered 2 pizzas which were fabulous, we ordered the lasagna pizza and quattro stagioni. We were still a little hungry so asked the server for advice, and he was dead on for a great pizza. We ordered the Settobello pizza instead of the nutella pizza. Next time we are ordereing the nutella and settobello pizza. The pizza crust was light and exactly how i like my pizza. I wouldn't do it any different way. I am going to try to be back every weekend."}
{"text":"If you love pizza and appreciate a good pie, this is the place to stop and eat at! This place is so good!  A must!  I can't even express enough how good it is!"}
{"text":"I went there last week the salad was great the pizza tasted good but I wasn't used to soggy pizza"}
{"text":"This is very authentic Napoli pizza, and it was delicious!  This was my first time at the restaurant and I will definitely be back.  We wanted simple Italian and ordered a simple insalata which was delicately dressed and not soggy.  The crust of the pizza was not heavy, had good bite and flavor with the right balance of savory and spice -so good!  The location is good too and you can take a nice walk after dinner to balance the carbs."}
{"text":"If you are looking for excellent pizza with high-quality ingredients, Settebello is the place to go. There aren't any unnecessary bells and whistles - the short, one-page menu lists just a few appetizers alongside the pizza, but the small selection ensures that every item you eat there is delicious. The pricing is reasonable, bordering on inexpensive, for the quality of the food you're getting.   Don't skip the appetizers! The salads are especially fresh and beautifully-constructed. I would recommend the Panzanella salad to share; it's light enough that it won't distract you from your pizza later, but with flavor and body from the shaved cheese and proscuitto crisps to make it worth your while.  As for the pizza, the dough is thin and soft with just a bit of a crunch; it'll fall apart if you try lifting the slices and eating by hand. You'll be happier in the end for having to pick up your knife and fork, though. You'll appreciate the distinctness of the ingredients; the toppings aren't drowning in seas of cheese and sauce and grease, and every bite is different and delicious.   The food is definitely the number-one selling point at Settebello, and the ambiance is a good second, with the cozy-but-classy casual atmosphere. The service needs a bit of work though - it's just \"okay\". For the excellence of the food they're serving, the average-ness of the wait staff is a bit of a letdown. They're efficient, but lukewarm at best on their own. They do a little better if you break the ice yourself, though. Don't hesitate to ask your server for clarification if you need help with the menu and all the Italian food terms, they give good advice."}
{"text":"This place is great.   I ordered a starter of bruschetta, which looked amazing. The crispy pancetta on the top was a nice touch; however the toast points were lacking in flavor and texture, and possibly freshness. I would have appreciated it more if it were served with fresh, toasted (possibly in their Italian oven?!) bread rubbed with garlic or olive oil.  The pizza was dynamite and could not be improved upon. I had a margherita, and my husband had a Diavolo. My son ordered a smaller cheese children's pizza - nice to have a kid option.  Service was good. Decorated nicely. Next time I'll take care to wear something better than shorts and flip flops."}
{"text":"Love this place and my kids do too - here are the top reasons:  1. Fast.  This pizza cooks quickly.  2.  Great big booths!  3.  Authentic, unique and super yummy pizza - the kids menu is great (make your own pizza with gelato at the end) 4.  Great salads for those of us who don't eat a lot of carbs - I love their Arugula Salad  Just a great place to go - comfortable, great food and kids friendly!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza anywhere.  They're all personal sized.  You can eat it all and be full, or get a salad and save half the pizza for later.  I haven't tried dessert yet, but they have a Nutella dessert pizza!  Authentic Napoletana pizza, with many of their ingredients imported from Italy.  My favorite choices are the Bianca (Prosciutto Crudo, Arugula, Parmigiano Reggiano, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), the Vico (Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), and the Emilia (Prosciutto Cotto, Panna (Italian Cream), Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiona, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil).  I guess I don't like crushed tomatoes :/  You can add other veggies, meats, cheese, or pine nuts for additional cost."}
{"text":"Amazing service, good pizza, great atmosphere!  I came here with my bf and we were both very pleased with this restaurant.  We ordered the grande salad ( great choice), and the settebello. The pizza had a really good flavor, the only bad part was the fact that it was a bit soggy.. Other then that I totally loved this place!  The best part of this place was the amazing service that  Maryann gave us! She was great, she gave us a little history of the restaurant and very knowledgeable of the products! Houpelly, you will get it!"}
{"text":"The Neapolitan pizza is different than what I am used to.  It is a good crust, but I still like a thin crisp crust.  Their menu for the pizza and the salads has unusual combinations.  The staff is very nice and helpful.   I like the interior and the atmosphere.  It is that combo of modern and friendly that works. Yes, I will be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza bolognese wasn't anything out of the ordinary the pizza crust was thin but not crisp it was a bit soggy and the taste was okay. We also got the only pasta available it had bits of asparagus nothing special there isn't a lot of variety. Service was good."}

{"text":"Favorite pizza place ever! Service is always stellar! This place feels like you would find it in a smaller town, something more like Reno, or Bend OR, or Fort Collins CO."}
{"text":"This is not your traditional pizza joint. They serve wood fired individual or for two sized pies that have an interesting selection of toppings. They always arrive quickly and hot.  Our service has always been good and the atmosphere is slightly above the average for a tavern style place. They have a nice selection of beers as well as a full bar.   We go on a regular basis when we want a pizza that is better than the average one you get elsewhere. The settebello version is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"This is very good, but not cheap Italian food. The meatballs are prob the best I've ever tried. The rigatoni was ok, and the pizza is pretty good. The caprese salad was amazing! Must try their mozzarella:)"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza- ordered one and before it was half way gone, the two of us ordered another just to get our complete fill of it before leaving Las Vegas.  Great service too.  We will be back..."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite authentic pizza place! No matter what you choose, you can't go wrong.  My favorites include the Caprese or Beet salad; Vico or Settebello Pizza. The Nutella Pizza is pure bliss for your tastebuds."}
{"text":"Was in town for a golf tournament and wanted a good sit down pizza place.  We found Settebello's and it was great.  Different than normal pizza choices but very good quality and incredible taste.  When back in town we will surely revisit.  We will also recommend to friends coming to visit Vegas/Henderson."}
{"text":"Their pizza never fails.. always so delicious! The Panzanella salad was great! Just enough Parmesan cheese shavings for that hint of salt and the cherry tomatoes were fresh! My son loves their cheese pizza and he's a picky eater.  I also love that they have specials almost every day so make sure to check that out.  The service is always so friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Soggy pizza  and very dry crust I ordered sausage there were a few crumbs of it on one side of the pizza. I have had much better I won't return."}
{"text":"I have been patiently waiting for years for a west side location for this Henderson landmark.  Over the top best.  Josh our server could not have been more engaging, helpful and informative about the new location.  Only negative is I am sure it will be hard to get in once everyone know they are there.  I have a photo of the salads and pizza we had put cannot figure out how to post."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the positive reviews on this place. Everything barley edible. I guess I just like \"American\" pizza. Everything was bland and there was hardly any meat on the thing. Would never recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Great authentic pizza.  Tables not very clean with countless glass rings.  The staff was not attentive as we had to get up to ask for additional tea and napkins.  Booths looked very comfortable but the wooden (no pad) chairs we had were not comfortable. While they have some gourmet salads on the menu there is nothing but pizza.  No Caesar salad, house salad, calzones, etc.   Menu not diverse enough for our party of six.   I'd suggest get this pizza to go, which is what we'll do in the future.  It would have gotten only 1 star except for the very good pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza and good service. Great dessert as well. It is a good pizza no doubt but I have been to some places that do it better. That said, I don't know what other options are in the area and I know how jaded I sound. Definitetly worth going to at least once to try!"}
{"text":"This pizza is the real deal. We are so fortunate to have authentic Neapolitan gems like this in Henderson. The \"Bianca\" is my personal favorite. We buy the flour to duplicate at home but you really need the 900 degree oven to pull it off. Exquisite!"}
{"text":"The service is bad most of the time, however the food is delicious. The regular crust gets sloppy and wet in the middle so go for the gluten free as its chewy and holds its texture. I don't have gluten restrictions and still choose it over the regular every time...trust me you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"San Marzano tomatoes and perfect crust make a bad week so much better. It had been a while (too long actually) since I'd been back to Settebello but after having a rough week it was time. I was not disappointed. I was seated promptly, ordered a \"Settebello\" (it's the bottom offering on the menu but I love it the best) pizza, and with the first bite the stress of everything going on just faded away.   While I love Old School Pizzeria and Chef Gio's pizza, there's just something super special about this place. When you leave nothing on your plate but the faint remnants of the slightly singed crust, that says it all.   Still 5 Stars, Still Best of Las Vegas worthy, and I wonder if it warrants inclusion on my Mythical 6th Star List. If you haven't been here yet you really need to quit procrastinating and just do it."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and great service. Pizza is a little soggy in the middle but I was explained before hand so that was fine. Pizza is a thin crust style and is very fresh. Atmosphere is upscale casual and fun to people watch. Great for a sir down lunch or dinner with a drink. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Warm Beets ($8.50): Roasted golden and red beets, goat cheese crema, roasted garlic, dill, olive oil, and Marcona almonds. Wonderful antipasti dish! The beets were lovely. I was really pleased with the goat cheese crema as it was a modest amount and didn't dare overpower the beautiful beets. The almonds were a nice touch!  Polpette Napoletane ($14): Neapolitan beef and pork meatballs, covered in Neapolitan tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil. The meatballs were simple and just loaded with meat and practically no filler. It's served with buttered toast that's been tossed into the oven as well; delicious.  Margherita DOC ($14): Crushed tomato, mozzarella di bufala, parmigiano, and basil. This is one of my all-time favorite pizza styles and this is definitely one I'd want again. The dough and all the components created a solid Napoletana pizza. They also have a non-DOC option without buffalo mozzarella for $12.  Pizza Carbonara ($13): Crushed tomato, panchetta, egg, cracked pepper, parmigiano, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil. All of their pizzas start the same way, so it's the same great crust/dough. My disappointment with this pizza was the scarcity of toppings and the cooked yolk - that's definitely not what I was expecting. Since this is atypical for Carbonara, I think it should be disclosed on the menu or as you order.  The restaurant is beautiful and the vibe is classy yet casual. I love that everything cooked is thrown into the blistering-hot brick oven. I also like the non-pizza offerings and look forward to trying several of those as well. There is a happy hour during the week (M-Th 3-6PM, 8-9PM & F 3-6PM, 8:30-10PM) with most selections at $5/each."}
{"text":"Love love love it!! This is the best pizza I've ever had in LV. I mean, I found a super delicious pizza that I really wanted to eat at last!! Thank you for letting me know, My gourmet friends. I would like to eat all kind of Pizza here!! I know that is very greedy, but it is worth to become greedy for this pizza. And Staff is so cheerful and kind and friendly and very thoughtful.We will be back here for sure ASAP!"}
{"text":"They have the most authentic italian pizza I have had since living and leaving Italy! One and only complaint from me is that I like stemmed wine glasses and they DO do it traditionally in a small rock glass!"}
{"text":"What great pizza!  And gelato!  My husband is gluten free so he sometimes has to opt for a salad when we go to a pizza place, but not at Settebello!  Hands down, they have the best gluten free pizza we have had to date.  There are at least three other restaurants within a two to three mile radius that make gluten free pizza but they don't even come close in comparison!  Because the gluten free pizza in most restaurants is usually just a step up from cardboard, the rest of my non gluten free family usually orders a regular crust.  So when we dined we had a settebello on gluten free crust as well as a regular crust Quattro Formagio.  The gluten free crust was even better than the regular.  My husband swore they must have given him the wrong pizza or mixed up our order.  The waiter mentioned the gluten free crust would take a few extra minutes.  The regular crust pizza was way soggy in the center - maybe because it had to wait for the gluten free pizza to be ready? We found out they import their gluten free flour from Italy and it's the same brand as their regular crust flour, just the gluten free version.  We have loved their pizza for years before finding out about my husbands allergy but have to admit we had stayed away.  My daughter really wanted pizza so we went in not expecting that everyone would be able to eat pizza.  Have to say it great.  The crust on the gluten free was actually crusty and tasty!  The service was great and attentive.  We also ordered gelato and it was divine!  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First off, AMAZING salad. It had artichoke hearts, goat cheese, pine nuts, arugula, and a delicious balsamic. I could eat that everyday.   The pizza was great!  Our only complaint is that we've been twice and even though we asked for well done the second time, the center of the pizza was soggy. The crust is delicious and the sauce creates a flavor explosion... So there has to be a way to keep the pizza napolentana style on the soft style without getting a soggy center. I still loved it, just can't do take out or leftovers because you would open up a really soggy mess if you tried to eat it on the second day.   We will definitely be back time and time again."}
{"text":"The food here is good but not great. The pizza is always soggy in the middle, no matter the topping. The outer crust is perfect, chewy and a little dense. I'm flummoxed as to why they use arugula as the only green in their salads.   I have been to Settebello in UT, CA and this location twice. I keep trying to give them another shot but they always fall short.  The problem is the service. I have never been asked if I would like dessert or coffee, and I do want both. I am a middle aged average looking Caucasian woman. Usually dining out with the hubby or friends. I like to enjoy my meals out. It is not up to the server to decide that I shouldn't have dessert, and that is what I'm feeling here. Maybe I'm overly sensitive but dinner last night was the last straw. Eric, our waiter, seemed like he couldn't get us out the door fast enough. We had to ask for refills on our drinks and when we did he brought our check. No dessert and no more Settebello. Someone at corporate needs to make sure the wait staff is trained properly."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5 times. The menu is ok.  Basic but overhyped.  It's always overcrowded and loud to me and food tries a little to be eclectic pizza but it's just ok to me. I find this place very mediocre but easy to stop in for a quick bite  What I don't like is the lackluster service.  Usually when a friend suggests we go here, I just roll my eyes and suggest another place.  I'm just not crazy about their food.  I don't know what it is.  A bit overpriced for pizza, but my friends like it."}
{"text":"My first time in here the service was outstanding very quick very attentive give me a great suggestion when a warm beet salad as I wanted to eat clean. I ordered the Quattro pizza with extra mozzarella which came to me quickly tasted very good and I was pleased with the overall meal. I came earlier right around 11 so it was wide open with great service."}
{"text":"First time eating at Settebello this afternoon, and I was impressed! I came with my whole family - wife and five kids. We were promptly seated and introduced to the menu. The hostess provided coloring pages and crayons to keep our youngest three kids occupied. Our waiter, Patrick, did a great job answering questions and was very congenial and attentive throughout the meal. The ambience was casual yet classy, with a stone and wood pizzeria hearth motif. We ordered a beet salad as an appetizer. The salad was super fresh - sweet beets, sweet carrots, spinach-style salad leaves sprinkled with a tangy oil based dressing with rich crumbled cheese and pine nuts. We all ordered pizzas, which come in 8\" and 12\" sizes. As a man with a big appetite, I found the 8\" Settebello pizza to be filling. I was able to sample from all the pizzas my family ordered: Cheese pizza, House Sausage pizza, pizza with pear & jalapeño marmalade sauce, and pizza with Calabrese meat. All had rich, fresh, tasty ingredients and were very flavorful. Understand the nature of this style of pizza is it is thinner, chewier, and able to fold like a taco. Excellent pizza, excellent customer service, I highly recommended this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Overall, the food was good.  Not the best in state, as it's rated, but definitely good. There were 3 of us in our party, me and 2 guys (I was a lucky girl).  We ordered the Insalata Grande to start, which was made of Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, and Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Definitely plenty for the 3 of us to share.  Your doctor would approve of the healthy, tasty ingredients in this salad!  We ordered 2 pizzas, Margherita DOC and the Setebello.  They're 12\" pizzas.  2 was plenty for us but if you had really big eaters, you'd probably need 1 per person.  Upon ordering, our server asked us if we wanted our pizza cut in slices. To us that was strange.  Don't they always cut pizza in slices?  Apparently, here they don't unless you ask.  We asked if we didn't get it sliced, how are we supposed to eat it?  Do we take a bite and then pass it to the next person at our table?  Very strange question we thought.  The Setebello pizza is their signature pizza so we had to try that one.  It was delicious.  Very flavorful, fresh ingredients.  The Margherita DOC pizza was good, but the Setebello blew it away.  The Margherita DOC pizza was made with crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The Setebello pizza was made with Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The crust reminded me of a flour tortilla.  It was soft and even burnt like a tortilla you would warm up on the stove.  Not my favorite crust.  I wish it was a little crispier.  Now, dessert was the best!  We ordered the Chocolate Bomba.  It was a caramel, chocolate ice cream dessert that was to die for.  We devoured it in minutes!  Definitely the best part of the meal!  We agreed that it tasted like a Snickers bar ice cream dessert.    Our server, Jason, was awesome.  He gave us recommendations on what to order and was right on with what were the best menu selections.  It's so hard to come by good servers in restaurants today, and he was awesome!  The restaurant is casual but was a little loud, which made it kind of hard to converse over dinner.  We would definitely come back to this restaurant again, but all agree it's not the best pizza in Vegas. It's good, but not the best."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I had a delightful lunch on 4/18/13. Our waiter, Corey was warm and friendly. The pizza is some of the best, so fresh and flavorful. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First off, I would consider myself to be quite advanced in the art of pizza making and have tried a wide variety of styles, both at home and in some well known pizza spots across the country.  WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PIZZA AT SETTEBELLO:  This is authentic pizza napoletana (neapolitan).  If you don't know, that means it's classic pizza as it was originated in Naples.  It's a particular thin crust, slightly chewy type of pizza with mozzarella and basil as a typical starter.  For me, and for many, this is the best pizza there is.    There are very specific Italian standards that need to be met before one can get the official designation, and at the moment Settebello is the only place in Nevada that has it.  For more information, look at the official organization's site yourself:  http://anticapizzeria.net/vpn/home.html  Basically it means all their ingredients come from Italy, which would include Caputo flour (slightly different than the bread flour used in most pizzas here in the states) and San Marzano tomatoes, which to be officially authentic have to be grown in the volcanic soil of Mt. Vesuvius.  The mozzarella in the U.S. is typically fior di latte, but Neapolitans typically use mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella), and they do include this option.  Of course none of this would matter if they didn't cook it in a proper wood fired oven at very high temperatures.  The pizza has to cook very quickly to get the proper balance of crisp, chewiness, and melted cheese.  You'd be amazed at how long it can take to master this.  So that alone makes Settebellos special.  For anyone, much less a pizza lover, this is a classic dish that one must try in their lifetime.    What you should expect is a thin crust pizza, with an airy crust that has spots that borden on being burnt, if not a few hot spots that actually are.  It should be crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, but not as chewy as a traditional New York pizza which has higher levels of gluten.  The middle of the pizza will be soft, so absolutely do not expect a slice of pizza to hold up when you pick it up.  It will droop and bend, and this does not mean it was cooked improperly.  This is how it's supposed to be, and this is how we like it!  In fact, anyone from Naples wouldn't actually cut their pizza into slices, they would fold it up on several sides and eat it.  When I eat this pizza I definitely do not expect them to cut the slices, although they always ask, and I usually tear it in half first and then fold the halves once more and eat it that way.    The waiting staff was always helpful.  They allowed me to mix up my pizza so that one half is one style and the other is another style.  The second time I did that the waitress got it wrong and thought I ordered two pizzas.  They decided to just give it to me at the charge of one.  Nice!  I'm a big fan of red pepper on pizzas, particularly the napolitanas.  But it's hard to go wrong with any of these options.  Just remember, if you go with DOP mozzarella, which is made from buffalo's milk, it's going to have a much stronger taste that some people love, and others really don't like.  If you're used to typical mozzarella, which is fior di latte, then feel free to keep it safe.  You might ask them to take a peek at their wood fired oven, and see how it's all done.  Seeing my pizza get baked is a pretty enjoyable experience in and of itself, and always makes the eating better.  Bottom line is, you can't beat the ingredients they use at these prices, and the authenticity of this place can't be found elsewhere in the area.  For me it's highly recommended, and every time I'm in Vegas I'm coming back.  Apparently they're doing well, they have a restaurant in Pasadena, CA, but I haven't tried that one yet."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good. Our server, Andrew, went above and beyond to really make sure we enjoyed our meal. The service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Let me say I am not an easily pleased person.  I also believe that good food can wait, so unless a restaurant has atrocious service, I don't really take into considering how many time the waitress refilled my drink or if they did everything I wanted.  I only care about taste and quality.  Allow me to also mention that this pizza is unique.  Do NOT come here expecting Chicago, New York or California style pizza.  It's called Napoletana for a reason (there are strict guidelines regulating genuine certified napoletana pizza, upheld by an association in Italy).  Sounds a little too much perhaps?  Maybe you shouldn't come here then.    If you do decide to try a something unique and fresh, I commend you.  Nearly anything is good.  The settobello is wonderful, however all pizzas should be eaten there.  Unfortunately, the thin crust absorbs the juices on top and doesn't last more than maybe, 20 minutes.   The ingredients are very fresh, food very delicious.  I have been here maybe 10 times within the year and have never been disappointed with a single pizza or antipasta."}
{"text":"Me the Uncle was treated to Settebello for Father's day. What a treat. We ordered Misto Salumi, and Italian meat platter. Surprised it came with a pizza size flatbread, a beet salad, big enough for three people and a pizza. The order was to much for 3 people. Everything came out fresh and the pizza was hot. We enjoyed the food, the service, and the atmosphere for a fair price. We will return. Interested in happy hour also."}
{"text":"I had high expectations going into this place because of the Certified Italian Pizza.  Started off with the Misto.  Nice little selection of meats and a little bit of cheese.  I liked the addition of the Olives and Artichoke Hearts.  I am an Artichoke fiend.  Probably the highlight of the meal.  I decided to try the Pizza Lasagna.  I wanted to see if they were able to capture the essence of a good lasagna.  The Ricotta was nice but it did not represent the fusion of Lasagna and Pizza.  Fork and Knife deal, it was soggy and wouldn't hold up when folded either.  Washed all down with a couple of decent Del Sole.  Maybe the other selections are better but you would have to take another Yelper's word for it because I am most likely not to return."}
{"text":"I have been going to Settebello since it opened in their old location. The best thing about them is the pizza of course. However, over the years, you take for granted the fantastic and friendly service. The food and service are always consistent and wonderful!  I think the best compliment I can give Settebello is that when we have visitors come to town we take them here. It's a a guaranteed winner. We have been there with people from Wisconsin, NY, Oregon, California, Washington and probably a few I am missing; everyone loves it and it's always good. Thank you Settebello for always being so friendly and good. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"The best Napoletana Pizza. Favorite spot to eat in town I stop by at least once a week. I grab lunch with clients or sometimes for dinner with the whole family. My personal favorite is the Amelia pizza and the Nutella filled zeppolis. Great service and the atmosphere inside is amazing. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza in Vegas! This location is also much slower than the green valley location. Wish it was busier because the food is so good. We usually get the Settebello and then whatever the special is"}
{"text":"Good service, pleasent place for a date, below standard dough. It cant be this hard to make average pizza for $20..."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for pizza! I went to Italy two years ago and Settebello comes closest to the pizza I enjoyed while in Naples.   I had the Margherita pizza but added prosciutto cotto. The perfect tasting crust and fresh ingredients make this my new favorite."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for their promotion of $5 margarita pizzas at this location every Monday!   According to their menu, their pizza is freshly hand crafted cooked in a 900 degree wood burner for about a minute.   I ordered the original margarita pizza. It's a pretty decent size for 1 or 2 people. The dough was very thin and soft and the blend of their crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, parmigiana, basil and olio was beautifully tasted amazing.   I really liked the atmosphere and their huge wooden tables. The lighting felt perfect for the dinner setting and it was not too dark or too bright.   The service was exceptional but very slow at refilling drinks. Overall I've enjoyed this pizzeria and would come back again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Seems quality has took a down slide. Ordered 3 pizzas and a beet salad Togo today and was not impressed. When hungry teenagers say it sucks that's pretty bad. I tried it myself and they were correct. And trying to convey to Brittany over the phone I just wanted 1 with sausage and pepperoni was quite challenging. Salad was delightful though. Two deserving stars"}
{"text":"You will love the pizza here if you like the clean fresh doughy crust kind of pizza. If you like greasy pizza...... DO NOT come here. I love the clean taste Setebello provides. I forgot the name but I came in for their one of their lunch specials which was a specialty 8 inch pizza [as opposed to 12in on their regular menu] for $9. You can add on a salad too for an extra $4. The pizza I chose had artichoke, mushrooms, and prosciutto. Super clean taste, just wish the pizza dough underneath was more crisp cuz my pizza ended up being soggy. The waitress is friendly but the hostess that day just looked like she hated her life which is a turn off since they're the first people you see when you walk in. Pizza here is a bit on the pricey side for the portion and toppings you get but hey it's probably because of the location and quality of ingredients they use."}
{"text":"As my brother is proof that not everyone likes the Napolitano style pizza, this is right up my alley. When it's nice and thin as if they wish they could create this on a big slice of naan or oversized cracker, that works for me. Lots of flavor and good individual size. Only have taken this to go so not sure about this service so this is purely on the fact that I consider this a great pizza."}
{"text":"The best pizza place in Las Vegas, hands down.   The arugula salad is always amazing for a non pizza choice.  The Misto is also great with its selection of salumi and cheeses.  All of the pizza's Ive had there were delicious, the Settebello and the Carbonara are my faves..  Service has been great and just ok but I will keep going back."}
{"text":"I have come here plenty of times, so I figured it was time to give it a review.  Ever since I stumbled on this place, I have always enjoyed each subsequent visit. They serve  Neapolitan pizzas that originates from Italy instead of the more traditional American versions like thin crust New York Style, Chicago deep dish, fancy California pizzas, etc.  They have a varied menu of appetizers, salads, pizzas, and desserts, so there are plenty of options for anyone to find something to suit their tastes. I normally tend to get their margherita, crushed tomatoes, cheese, olive oil, basil, and  parmigiano reggiano, and their Settebello, a pizza similar to the margherita but with sausage, pancetta and mushrooms.   I am always looking for a good cannoli and the one that they serve here is exceptional, especially coming from a pizza place.  As I am regularly pleased with their food and service, my only complaint is that the bottoms of their pizzas can be soggy and limp at times. Even when it does happen, which isn't often, the pizza still tastes awesome.  If you are a fan of pizza, and are looking for something different than your regular New York style or Chicago style joint, this would be a good addition to your pizza rotation."}
{"text":"Split a salad and a pizza with a loved one for a wonderful tasty meal.  The pizzas and salads are always tasty and satisfying now only to the eye, but more importantly to the belly.  A bit more expensive than other pizza joints, but you fo' sho' get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Over lunch they offer any of their premium pizzas in 8\" size for $9. We tried out the settebello and Bianca pies. They were good, but not great. I'd howevet give these guys another shot and order a large pie of their margherita or a simple pie to see how they do a classic.   The pies were good, but usually when pizza is amazing, the ingredients, texture, combination, proportions, etc. all sing in perfect harmony when you take a bite. The pizzas we had were fast tracked to be pros, but were still getting there. I was a wee disappointed since on yelp they have STELLAR rep.   Atmosphere is nice in Tuscan style with warm yellow hues. Don't sit near the oversized, wall-pendent. Huge globs of dust everywhere and there's fans around.   Good service experience."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! The ambiance is so quaint & romantic. The service was wonderful but I was a little upset that they close the oven down before closing. I got there an hour before they closed and our waiter told us they were shutting down their oven in about 10-15 mins, so we did feel a little rushed. I feel that if the restaurant closes at a certain time the earliest they should close down the kitchen is maybe 15 minutes early, especially for guests there for their first time.   The food...absolutely fantastic! Their pizzas are so delicious & full of flavor! The appetizers are wonderful. I honestly have no complaints whatsoever about the food. I'm Italian & I love authentic Italian food. This place does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Fabulous in every way. Extensive menu so something for everyone - and everything is prepared to perfection .. Service is outstanding no matter how busy it gets, and it does get busy. So happy to be able to do a true 5star review"}
{"text":"Love their pizza! Although it's more doughy, I just ask them to leave it in the oven longer for more of a crispy crust! Love love their tiramisu as well"}
{"text":"I still love this fabulous napoletana certified pizza! My favorite pizza to order is the settebello or the special of the day! The insalata grande and insalata involtini are my two favorite salads of any restaurant ever!  They have some great innovative cocktail concoctions so i try a different one each time.  Be ready to get lost in pizza heaven with this unique taste and style -nothing ordinary about it!"}
{"text":"Since opening a couple weeks ago, we have eaten here 5 times already.  Love this type of pizza and Settabello gets it right.  If you are looking for real pizza with quality ingredients then you need to eat here."}
{"text":"This is no pizza hut or papa john's type pizza. It's thin, has unique toppings and is very traditional italian pizza. I LOVE every type I've had (I've had most of the menu). I'll definitely be coming back soon! Don't forget to grab some of their house made gelato. We had cookies and creme once and it was to die for!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town and anyone who says otherwise just doesn't know pizza.  I've had many pizzas in some of the best pizza cities in America (chicago and NY), and I've had pizzas from around Naples, so I know my pizza well.  I am also a chef who loves to find good pizza.  And this pizza is the most authentic pizza in Las Vegas if you're looking for Napoleon style pizza.   The ingredients are all imported from italy, and they even had the oven built by a company from Naples.  You can definitely tell the effort they put into it.  The crust is thin, but flavorful.  The sauce has a great balance of tomato flavor and beautiful acidity, perfect as a backdrop for the fresh ingredients.  Even the sausages and hams are imported from Italy, so you will be getting great toppings too.  The cheese melts perfectly, and is the perfect finish to the pizza.   If you ACTUALLY like Italian pizza (unlike all the people that don't like this place), then you will love Settebello!  Try their Happy Hour too.  2 for 1 drinks, and cheap appetizers.  The fried calzone on the happy hour menu is amazing!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The pizza was mushy, greasy, and chewy, all at tbe same time. It might be considered decent my NV standards, but it wouldn't last a day in New York.  I'm updating this review an hour after eating. My friend got the cheese platter. The apple slices were mushy, the strawberries tasted like they'd been dipped in sugar sauce, and the cheese itself was nothing to write home about.  I'm going to have a hard time digesting tonight. Thank god I didn't finish my meal."}
{"text":"The pizza isn't anything to write home about.   Just as many people have mentioned, the dough is thin. It gets increasingly soggy as you eat, which is weird since the toppings are so sparse.   Our server, Justin, is friendly, but not attentive whatsoever.   We were so anxious to pay, and leave. Such a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza!  It is authentic Italian style with fresh ingredients.  If you're hungry, go ahead and get your own Pizza because you won't want to share!"}
{"text":"I have to give 5 stars here. It is a great location, beautiful ambiance, and quality food. The pizza is true serious gourmet pizza but not too bad of a price. The caprese salad is heavenly! But really, the best thing on the menu is the nutella and banana dessert pizza with powdered sugar sprinkled on top. It is made with the same pizza dough as the savory pizzas. I ordered one for my husband and I, but I ended up eating the WHOLE thing. It was irresistible."}
{"text":"My love for Neapolitan pizza started when I lived in Italy.  So to find out such a place like Settebello existed off strip in Vegas was amazing to me. We shared the Frito antipasta and Insalata Grande.  The focaccia was toasted perfectly and almost light for bread.  It paired well with the cured meats (especially the prosciutto), artichokes and bits of cheese.  The salad had super fresh ingredients and the perfectly dressed.  We ordered the Capriccosca pizza but substituted the prosciutto crudo instead of the cotto just because that's my favorite type of pizza. Definitely was not disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"We came here for pizza but what really stole the show was the cheese plate which is why it is getting a four star rating! It was so yummy! It came with several different types of cheeses, fruits, honey and jam. The honey was amazing! Sadly they didn't know the type of honey that is served with the platter but I would love to add it to my kitchen cupboard. I would need to get this again if we decide to go back.  For pizza we ordered the Pizza Bolognese. It was pretty good but since the sauce was so heavy it made the pizza flimsy and not crispy at the bottom. If you don't mind your pizza not as crispy I think you'd enjoy it. I did like all the sauce because it tasted good I just wish the pizza was toasted more at the bottom."}
{"text":"As a pizza aficionado I give this a 4.5. I dock half a point for finite texture issues with the dough and a lack of creative \"special\" pies/toppings.   With that said this is probably as authentic of a neopolitan pie I'll find in Vegas and I'm ok with that.  The sauce is perfect. The dough could have a more drastic crispy/doughy differentiation but that comes down to the types of flours used not the quality.    One very stiff negative for me is serving Rasputin stout from a bottle, not on nitro.  I was seriously appalled at this oversight.  It doesn't do that amazing beverage justice."}
{"text":"I came here about a week ago with my baba because Archie's was booked full and the overall experience at this place was very blah.  We came during the lunch rush and the place wasn't very busy. They're understaffed (3 people) and the 2 waiters and 1 waitress were dressed very inappropriately for work. In all honesty I thought they were customers themselves.  When we walked in the host tried to sit us at a high table with high chairs even though my father walks with a cane... I was shocked that this boy couldn't use common sense.  The waitress as very slow at getting us anything we needed and quite rude when we questioned her as to why she took 12 minutes to take our bill so she could run the card.  We both got the lunch special. My father got the panzenella salad with the settebello pizza and I got the beet salad with the diavola pizza. Both salads were very underdressed and dry. The pizzas where also lacking in flavor, depth and the crust was overcooked and chewy. I won't be coming back here but if you want to try it by all means go ahead. Nothing ventured nothing gained!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for lunch one day and were immediately handed a regular menu which describes each pizza as well as a special lunch priced menu (the 2 basic pizzas on the menu were priced at $7.00 each and any other pizza on the menu was $9.00, all till 3:00 PM).  This special lunch \"menu\" consists of a laminated card which just states the pricing - no items are listed in detail - you have to refer to the regular menu for that.  We thoroughly enjoyed our pizzas which were delicious and for the price, what a deal!  A few days later we came back with guests who were visiting us.  First of all, this time we were not handed the lunch priced menu -we had to ask for it.  Okay- no problem - maybe they forgot, (or maybe not!)  All four of us each ordered a pizza.  Again, delicious.  Now time for the bill.  Lo and behold we were charged the regular prices ($13 - $15 instead of $7 - $9).  We questioned the waiter who said he didn't realize we wanted the lunch prices.  Hello - why would we ask for the lunch priced menu and then order the same items for full price?  It was obvious we knew enough to ask for the lunch priced menu and then we wouldn't order off of it?  A little deceptive, I'm afraid.  We could have made a bigger deal out of it but we had guests with us and didn't really want to carry on.  So, just want others to be aware - be very specific when ordering and tell your server that you are ordering off the lunch priced menu or you just might be charged full price."}
{"text":"the margarita pizza is so yummy! just the right amount of sauce and cheese and it makes probably one of the best pieces of pizza I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Guys I have to tell ya, I was, as usual extremely excited to eat here on Friday evening. Couldn't wait for the meatballs smothered in delicious marinara and cheese, my Prosciutto Wrapped Arugula salad and  Settebelo Pizza.  The waiter took our drink order and we ordered the meatballs.  After about 5-10 minutes he came back and  took the rest of order of the salad and pizza.  He asked if we cared if it came out as it was ready and we said sure no problem, thinking the meatballs would be first and maybe the salad then the pizza.  The pizza came out in about 3 minutes after the order was taken and that had me thinking it's was someone else's pizza then the salad came out after the pizza and then heaven showed up THE MEATBALLS!!!! As I cut into the meatballs and placed on in my mouth I've come to find out, the hard way, they were all frozen in the middle.  I Mean really FROZEN. Sent them back and no manager stopped by and the waiter went into ignore mode!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely return! Pizza is thin crust.   Not greasy like some other chain pizza joints.   Nice atmosphere for a date but can also be family friendly.   Best part was the cannoli! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Best Gluten Free Pizza crust!  Love the Argula Salad with Shaved Parmesan to go with it."}
{"text":"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie its Settebello.....  Seriously folks this is in the top two pizzerias in the whole damn country in the running with Bianco's in Phoenix. i cannot go to the state of Nevada with out stopping here. if you want to understand what classic Neapolitan pizza is all about this is the place to try. They also have some fantastic starters and salads.   Ciao bella!"}
{"text":"Incredibile, Gustoso, Fantastico, Bella, Semplicemente la Migliore.  I do NOT speak italian, however, when you taste the food here, your mouth will be exploding with simple and great flavors that you will describe as Amazing, Tasty, Fantastic, Beautiful and Simply the Best!  1.  Parking - In the District and parking in the area they are at is very, very good. easy and short walk!  2.  Ambiance - Very nice, you feel like you are in  an urban environment compared to other places, and certainly 100% more visible than their former location at an empty strip mall on Horizon Ridge.  3.  The Wait - If you go during peak times, guess what, you gonna wait. There is not much room to wait, so you can give them your cell and walk around and wait outside or at a few of the shops. This is where West Elm gets most of their foot traffic me thinks.  If you go at slightly off hours,  like dinner on Friday at 7:45 pm to 9:00 pm, you can usually get a table immediately. During normal hours, you get a lot of larger families.  4.  The Food - Wow. what can i say?  I love PIZZA. I love Martino's Pizza at their place on Coronado Center and Eastern. I love Metro. I really enjoyed 3 Brothers when they were open.  I enjoy all the stuff in a mixed combo.  I would scarf down these pizzas!  Here at Settobello, the pizza is so DIFFERENT and so amazing...  a.  the ingredients - sure they have some combo's, yet the tastes are not overpowering or oily( I like this) or with tomato sauce.  the tastes are so subtle and so delicate, yet when mixed, just as good if not better than the normal pizza from other places.  b.  the crust - Wow again. the texture and taste, with it's slight taste from being cooked in a very hot wood fired oven. I cannot imagine that I, who usually stuff my mouth with food and swallow, stopped to experience the simple tastes. I normally don't get all that! I am the kinda person that when you ask me  how the red wine tastes, I will tell you it was, well, red. I don't distinguish the subtle flavors normally and for this place and their pizza, it was a great experience to do this!!!  c.  the how - as the crust is thin and the serving is about 12-14 inches round approximately, it is best to ask for it sliced if you are sharing, or at least eat with fork and knife.  If you are sharing go for whatever you  want to try, however, one pizza is plenty for one person, as it is thin.  We had the Settebello, the Margherita and the Pizza Lasagna... I am going back soon and maybe today!  5.  Dessert - Order the Nutella Pizza early, as it takes time to cook like a regular pizza, as it is the same pizza crust topped with nutella. You have like Nutella, however, I do and my kids do and this was a great tasting hot pizza dessert.  We also tried the Panna Cotta which was great.   6.  Service - While I was waiting with three kids for 35 minutes on a hot evening for a table, I could not help but watch the service.  Never, let first impression rule you. I assumed the service was going to be unorganized, all over the place, and just not efficient. What I got was caring, a lot of people jumping in to hep each other. Simply I experienced a group of people working toward a great experience. Very nice.  From a reformed pizza scarfer to one that likes this stuff they serve here at Settebello, I say, GO FOR IT.   GET OFF YOUR BUTTSKI and GO NOW.  Take action NOW.  Imma getting hungry....."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour (Monday-friday 8:30-10) and had the best service and the food was delicious! The happy hour menu had a lot to chose from and still had stuff to take home for later."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza. Absolutely perfect. I would have given it five stars. The pizza transported me to Italia. However, for the antipasti, the Caprese had an out of season tomato cut in some flower shape. It was rough and did not compliment the meal. Serve antipasti the way it should be and please offer wines from Campania. You cannot be DOC Napoletana style without wines from the same region. Consider an Aglianico from Vesuvius.  Then you are in the game."}
{"text":"Just as good as I had heard about and read in the other reviews.  Definitely a different kind of pizza than most are used to.  Had the Bianca and the Settebello.  Both were very good and I really loved the crust on the pizza.  I could have just eaten the crust.  For dessert we had the Nutella pizza and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I had the settebello pizza pie.  I would shove their pie in my face any time.  It's even acceptable to finger the pie in lieu of having it sliced, as they do in the motherland.   A waitress even ran out some forgotten pie as we left, bringing our dining experience to fruition"}
{"text":"The place has a great atmosphere and the service is pretty good but when it comes to their food, I can honestly say, I have never been more disappointed. It all happened somewhere between the the near topping-less margarita pizza and the puddle of grease that formed from it's limp \"thin crust.\" Maybe we just came on a bad night but I have never had a pizza this terrible. If you want a good pizza and a good atmosphere your better off going to metro pizza. I've gone there countless times and haven't been disappointed yet. Even a 5 dollar hot and ready is better than this fraud of a pizza joint."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Monday! 5 dollar Moscow Mule?! Hell yeah! $5 mini margherita pizza? Eff yesss! Sat at the bar, and my order was taken within 5 minutes. I got my Mule 3 minuted later and my pizza came out in about 7 minutes! Delicious certified neopolitan pizza, delicious mules! I will indeed be back again for future happy hours!"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza in the Valley.  The crust is very thin, and should be torn apart rather than cut into slices.  It ends up perfectly crunchy and chewy at the same time, with a nice char on the bottom.  The ingredients are all of the highest quality.  I won't recommend a specific dish, because we have been here so many times we've probably had every pizza.  I do go back to the Quattro Formaggi and add a couple of toppings.  And, the specials are always winners.  Smallish bar area, but very good prices.  Wine list not expansive, but certainly gets the job done.  Italian beers as well."}
{"text":"I came here simply because it was one of the top rated places on yelp. Both our server and the manager were amazing! We enjoyed the pizza tremendously and when I had accidentally ordered the wrong pizza, they ended up taking it off the bill after I talked with the manager Alexander. Amazing customer service and this is definitely a place I recommend to anyone wanting to be in a positive environment with awesome food!"}
{"text":"After watching David Chang's show \"Ugly Delicious\" on Netflix. I was craving Lucali Pizza. Or anything of the sort. We usually go to Pizza Rock for a good pie but I've been meaning to hit up Settebello for years but never made it there. Finally. And regret-tingly. Why didn't we go there.   We had the salads which were full of flavor. But they filled the plate so much that it was falling off. I don't mind because I wipe down the table with germx anyway so I had a big table sized plate.   The Lunch special was spectacular. You can pick any pizza for 9 bucks. Wife had Marg DOC and I had the 4 Cheese.   The crust is up there with the best we've ever experienced. Not had. Experienced. Because that's what it was. An experience. Money can't buy that.   Panna cotta dessert was spot on but the \"whatever the name is\" dessert with a gelato choice covered in espresso and caramel was one of the better desserts I've had in the last few years.   Service was good enough to warrant a decent tip. She came just enough to not wonder where she was.   Will def be back. Make the dive and visit ASAP. Even if there's a line. Can't be longer than the 2 hour lucali wait."}
{"text":"Before I ate here the waiter explained to me the crust was thin, crispy, yet chewy and the cheese was a \"wet\" mozzarella.  I'll try anything once.  A unique pie with unfortunately soggy wet floppy crust was presented to us. If that's obligated to the style then this probably isn't the pizza place for me. It was like topping soup poured on paper-thin soggy flatbread. But hey, it was a good soup, and the waiter complimented my fresh haircut. B)"}
{"text":"Looking for a unique pizza? This is the one. Out of all the pizza restaurants in the Vegas area that I've been to this is the most unique.  The pizza is excellent. The beauty about this pizza is that you can tell its ingredients are original. You won't find anything like it. Also, you can order your own pizza and eat it. The whole thing and not feel terrible . It's little sauce and little cheese. Very thin crust.   The restaurant is excellent with service and cleanliness.   I've eaten here several times and will continue to in the future!"}
{"text":"My husband loves pizza and had heard from a coworker that Settebello had excellent authentic pizzas.   We went on a Friday night and it was busy! It was only about a 15 minute wait and they let us know our table was ready by sending a text to my phone.   The restaurant is pretty big and has a nice bar set up. You can also sit outside which is nice. This is a great place for a large group. Today we got a booth which had a marble table top. They have really unique art all over the walls.   The pizza is cooked in a wood oven and the crust is thinner and chewier then most crusts. It kinda reminded me of a whole wheat tortilla. Our waitress explained that the pizzas come in 12 inch personal size.She also explained that traditionally the pizzas are not cut into slices. (But they will if you ask.)   We started with the Rucola Salad and the Focaccia bread. The salad was a bed of Arugula dressed with lemon juice and sea salt. It was ok. Nothing special. The Focaccia bread gave us a sample of the crust to come. I enjoyed dipping it in the nutty olive oil and tangy balsamic vinegar.   For our pizzas I ordered the Emilia which had an alfrado sauce instead of the classic tomato sauce. They called it an Italian cream sauce. It also had prosciutto, basil, parmigiano, and mozzarella cheese. I loved the toppings. They all melted together so well. With all that cheese how could it ever be bad! My husband ordered the Pizza Carbonara which had crushed tomatoes, pancetta, egg, parmigiano, mozzarella cheese, and bits of basil. I liked Joel's, but I have to say I really enjoyed mine more. (He did as well. lol) That Italian cream sauce was so tasty! I would have loved a bowl of that sauce to dip my Focaccia bread in! (mental note that for next time!)   Settebello is a great pizza place. Looks like it also would be a great place for happy hour. They have a full drink menu that I would love to come back and try. The staff was friendly and attentive which is a huge plus. My only gripe would be that it was waaaay hot in there. Like sweating so bad I needed a napkin hot! But other then that my experience was great. When I'm craving real pizza I'll sure be back here."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN VEGAS! I dont even like pizza this place ensured me there is a chance."}
{"text":"The pizza was awesome!  Tasty and crispy crust and just the right amount of cheese and toppings.  Thanks so much to Linda and Tami for introducing us to this place."}
{"text":"There are several reasons why I was presently surprised with Settebello.  First and foremost the service was great! We sat outside on their charming patio, the atmosphere had an old-fashion Sicilian style which was very inviting.  Secondly, our food was awesome! My wife and I spilt the insalata grande (big & delicious salad) and the Settebello pizza. We loved the brick-oven style pizza with the thin crust plus the pine nuts, mushrooms, sausage, and tomatoes added so much favor.  We also took part in their happy hour: 2 for 1 Drinks starting at 3pm!"}
{"text":"I came to this place for first time and I felt in Italy, is so good, all the ingredients are fresh and most of the product comes from Italy. All the decorations makes it a really nice place to enjoy a really good pizza napolitana style. Very original concept and quality.  I only eat gluten free pizza which is hard to find good quality pizza and they make the best so far.  The service is amazing so I really recommend this place. Check it out."}
{"text":"This place was OK. I came here recommended by a friend and brought along 3 other friends. The pizza was mediocre. I can honestly say Metro Pizza has WAY better pizza than this place. Our server was cool, Even though it took him 10 years to get my friend her long island ice tea drink. I was dissapointed when we ordered the bruschetta. It ONLY came with 2 pieces on a HUGE platter and we paid $9 for it. One was bigger than the other and the smaller one was burnt. I don't think it was worth the price but it was still good. The platter it was on looked like it could have came with 4 or 5 pieces total. Wasn't too hyped up about this place. I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"The food here is good...our pizza was good but I really loved the vanilla ice cream it tastes home made"}
{"text":"I do not get the love for this place.   We had to go have another dinner later the night we went here because we hated this place so much.  First of all, it's pretty expensive.  Second, the pizza was so thin and soggy it was awful.  I will never be back here."}
{"text":"Settebello's has added a happy hour from 3-6 M-F (I believe) and it is fantastic.  The food offered is different and delicious and the drink specials are good.  Brian served us and he couldn't have been nicer.  His recommendations were spot on, however, I would add a salad (their involtini is amazing) to the happy hour hors d'oeuvres and it would be a complete meal.  Brian said they filled up later in the evening but we were there at 5:30 and did not wait.  I am sure it is worse on Fridays."}
{"text":"This un-pretentious place in Henderson has some of the best pizzas in town. If you like thin, crispy crusts, this is the place to go. I've tried several, but my favorite is the Capricciosa, which has olives, artichokes, basil, and more goodies. I think they execute it to perfection, and they get it right every single time! The Caprese Salad is nice too, though this is a dish that is hard to mess up (though so many home cooks do so). I also enjoy their Beef Carpaccio, which always leaves you craving for more. Overall, this place is always busy, has a nice ambiance, and is very un-pretentious, despite their excellent food."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC pizza! I'm from NY and have eaten at some of the best places there, including John's, Lombardi's and Patsy's, and this was probably in that ballpark. I thought the dough at Setebello was particularly great, whereas the cheese and sauce were only normal-great. (Check out http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm. Settebello is listed as \"to be tasted\"! That means something.)  On top of the great taste, there isn't a long wait, and on Mondays, Margherita pies are only FIVE BUCKS! The service was great too.  Although the pizza was great, I wasn't in love with the meat balls. I have trouble bringing myself to call them anything better than \"average\".  The deserts were pretty awesome though. Not \"tier one you MUST have them\", but definitely good."}
{"text":"Have been going here for a couple of years now and it is hands down the best Neapolitan style pizza in Las Vegas! Their margherita pizza is a pizza purest's heaven, but I also love the Capricciosa with prosciutto, artichokes, mushrooms and olives...mmmm!  I also have enjoyed some of their salads, particularly, the beet salad with goat cheese and the simple Rucola with arugula, large Parmesan shavings, lemon juice, sea salt, pepper, and olive oil-- pure, clean healthy flavors!  There prices did go up $1 across the board about 6 months ago which puts them in borderline outrageous pricing for what they serve, but the District @ GVR is definitely a \"mini strip\" with restaurant offerings that are all premium compared to other local eateries."}
{"text":"On a last minute lunch date, I decided to join 4 other coworkers at Settebello.  One, because I heard the place is amazing and two, I haven't been here before, so of course, I jumped at the opportunity to create a review!    This restaurant is located within the East side of the District.  When you walk in you'll notice the high ceilings and exposed air ducts.  Makes it feel like an industrial warehouse and super modern.  There are brick facade wall coverings, large windows, dark wood chairs, granite looking table tops and the delightful smell of pizza dough fills the air.  I especially noticed the eclectic pictures of Italian artistry.  The place looks like a high end pizzeria!  I was excited.  The server had very little interaction with our table and didn't seem to like the fact that we wanted to split the checks at the end.  What I did like were the hosts and serving assistants.  They were super attentive and kept checking on our table to see if we needed water or boxes for our leftovers.  Certainly made up for the server's attitude.  For my meal, I got the one and only, Settebello Pizza for $13.50.  This pizza is packed!  Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, fresh mozzarella, basil, extra virgin olive oil.  WOW, I was loving it!  The crust was crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.  There were blotches of melted mozz balls throughout the pizza.  Love mushrooms on my pizza and they did it up!  The pancetta was fatty and savory, the sausage chunks were huge and dispersed evenly.  I think the crushed tomatoes and basil combination made the pizza taste super homemade.  This pizza was on point and super delicious!  Highly recommended.  If you're in the area, you NEED to try this place out!  In fact, I'm going back next week on another lunch escapade.  I was pleasantly surprised and super thankful I came along.  Another great find here in Las Vegas in my books.  Thanks Settebello!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to use my free pizza coupon and get some food on happy hour!!! Our server bethanie was super nice and was very attentive and knowledgable.  The staff were also very polite. The interior of this place was sooo upscale and absolutely beautiful.  Their happy hour is incredible. 5$ Moscow mules.... You can steal my money everyday. Their carbonara pizza was sooooo amazing! Me and my BF killed all of it. Their happy hour meat and cheese plate was super good, and their mini pizzas were great! Our bill only came out to 30 something $ which is a steal. I will definitely be coming back and blowing all of my money here! Can't wait to try all of the pizzas!"}
{"text":"We had spent the afternoon at the Fine Art Gallery in Bellagio getting inspired by the Monet's. We decided on an early dinner and headed to The District to go to Cheesecake Factory. Well, the wait was a good 45 minutes. I was willing to wait but we had the kids with us so my husband recommend we walk over to Settebello. We had never been there before but we always pass by when we head to Cheesecake or Whole Foods. Every time it looks like everyone is having a great time and the vibe looks awesome. It was busy but we were seated right away. The decor is lovely and adds to the vibe...relaxed chic, perhaps. All of the servers are young and well, attractive. But better yet, they are super friendly! I love that in a  server- just talk to me like you're my friend... Also, he spoke to my daughter and her friend (5 and 10 yrs old) very sweetly as well. He kept asking \"Girls, do you need anything? Girls, are you okay?\" It was very endearing. He even gave them some breadsticks that come with the kids meal even though they did not get a kids meal. I could tell from the moment I tasted my Americano that they only use premium ingredients. It was a very fine Italian coffee. I have to say that Naples style pizza is my favorite and Settebello does an excellent job at it. The ingredients are just so quality and that makes them so delicious. I ordered the Capriossa- mushrooms, artichoke hearts, Kalamata olives, basil and olive oil. It was such a lovely melody of flavors! Also, the meal was very light (especially for pizza). It was just such a lovely experience all around. I was so very impressed by the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Definitely loved the atmosphere and interior of this restaurant! If I walked into this restaurant, I wouldn't think it would be a place where pizza was served. I would recommend this place for couples and or family dinners.   Unfortunately, I did not really enjoy the food. We ordered the settebello and carbonara pizzas and it was just alright. You can definitely taste the difference between their pizza and a regular pizza from papa john's, I'll give them that, but I wasn't in love with it. We also ordered the cannoli and it was meh."}
{"text":"Whenever I hear about something being so hyped up I get a bit hesitant specially when a few of my close friends didn't think it lived up to the hype.   We were in the area, got shafted at a few options we wanted to go to over this, but glad we ended up going. I haven't had a Napoletana pizza in a while.   We started off the meal with a Misto ($13) plate which has a assortment of bread, meat, cheese and accompaniments. The bread was a bare pizza and our plate consisted of pickled cippolini onions, basil, artichoke, salume di napoli, mortadella, proscuitto, light cured ham, parmesan, provolini. You can taste the quality of the components and I love good charcuterie and was pretty happy with it.   We got the Del Cafone pizza ($12). The toppings were quality and the pizza crust was decent. Napoletana pizza I don't think is for everyone and it's not a substitute/nothing like other thin crust styles. I like a bit of a char flavor and chewy, airy in a spongy way type crust is alright for me since I find that enjoyable in certain breads like pao`.   Finished the meal with a dream bomba ($5) which was a peanut butter ice cream covered in a chocolate shell. It says it has a caramel heart, but there was very little of it. It was okay, but I kinda wished I got a panna cotta. Ordered this since I haven't had a bomba before but keep seeing it pop up on menus recently.   The service was very good. Friendly and super attentive without being intrusive. Our drinks never reached more than half empty, helpful with tips, intuitive about the check, etc.  If you're a fan of this style, then come here specially since it's VPN certified. This isn't the best Napoletana I've had in the US (Bollini's or A-16 wins for me) but your best bet in Vegas for authentic Napoli pizze."}
{"text":"This was our first time and we will be back. Delicious pizza, yummy salad & good service. Waitress answered all of our questions, before we even asked. & the food came out in good time and was great! Def the new go to pizza place for my fiance&I."}
{"text":"This used to be such a good place but unfortunately, now its changed... for the worst!  Dined on a Monday, nobody was on the front but my wife, kids and I. Was on the front for a while, so I stood by the table where the host should be. Stood there for quite sometime, hostess was just passing by. When she finally decide to come by, she asked me if we have been helped. Confused, I thought to myself, isnt her job to seat guest down?   Then the waitress came by our table. As I was ordering, it was only a one way communication. I was telling her our order but she isnt saying a word, after I finished. She finally replied, \"is that everything?\" Such great customer interaction! Wow!  Here's the only positive, the order arrived quickly, but the mozzerela cheese wasnt melted on the margherita! What a shame.  At the end when I asked for the bill, again they seem to be just passing our table and doesnt care at all. There was only 5 small tables that night. 2 servers and a host that helps. It was such a terrible customer service.   Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"The place was quite nice for a small little restaurant. I took the CEO of the company I work for as well as a field tech. It was nice, clean, not loud and obnoxious and the pizzas were delicious! I recommend the Beet salad, yum."}
{"text":"Located at the next block over from The District, it is a quick and convenient walk to enjoy a light bite.   This restaurant is a little difficult to find as it is quietly tucked away behind Cheesecake Factory and other eateries that can be seen on the Main Street, but finding this is worth it!   We ordered the Margherita pizza, which can easily be split between two people. It is large enough and hearty to fill your bellies without being uncomfortably full! The dough and mozzarella cheese were the best part of the pizza, the sauce was a little watery...however it seems like they make the sauce from scratch as we could see chunks of fresh tomato as we were enjoying our slices. I wish the sauce was a little thicker and less watery since it made the sauced part of the pizza less crispy and I prefer my pizza to be crispy throughout.   The prices are comparable to others at $13-$15 per pizza, and they offer a nice variety of dessert varying from tiramisu to gelato (dessert prices range $5-$10), which we will return to try one day.   This block has its own free parking lot shared with the other restaurants and Whole Foods."}
{"text":"If you love pizza this place is a no brainer. Neapolitan style pizzas hot out of the brick oven. We ordered the panzanella salad which is the only salad you can't make any changes to. Has arugula , prosciutto crisps , fresh fennel , fresh juicy yellow & red grape tomatoes and cucumber. Off the top of my head I may have forgotten something. Oh yah ! The Parmesan ! How could I forget ?!It's so buttery and creamy it literally melts in your mouth. You can definitely taste the quality of the tomatoes. Super yummy and the olive oil. Must have been some good olive oil. Oh my.   The Emilia - white pizza with prosciutto and basil. Heavenly ! The saltiness of the cheese and prosciutto with the chewiness of the crust. Basil on top. OMG !   Margarita with pancetta. My sister decided to order pancetta on hers. Honestly I would have appreciated a bit more cheese but this is Neapolitan style pizza and I think less cheese is what they're aiming for. It was good just probably would have been better with the Spicy pepperoni.   Remember these pizzas look bigger in photos then they actually are and can feed one hungry person and 2 semi hungry people.   Tiramisu - this was rich , creamy and decadent perfection. Layered with lady fingers , cream and espresso. You could definitely taste the sharp kick of espresso. It was so good !   Servers were all friendly and helpful I will definitely be back for more pizza and dessert !"}
{"text":"Awesome service. Awesome pizza. Awesome drinks. Great happy hours. One of my Henderson favs"}
{"text":"Very casual, no pasta here just pizza and side dishes, salads so you know. Had the Settebelo pizza, very tasty, more than enough for one person. Good service, thanks Samamtha."}
{"text":"I look forward to going and checking out Settebello again. On my first visit I unfortunately ended up with an upset stomach on my way there but was so determined to go that I didn't let that stop me (I probably should have).  The pizza was very interesting. Coming from NY I am very judgemental on pizza and my views on what it should be and taste like... making it very hard for me to find a pizza I am satisfied with. The pizza I had was tasty and had interesting flavors. My girlfriend seemed to enjoy hers as well. The atmosphere was very relaxed and it was very quiet the afternoon we visited.  The server was ok... no major complaints but didn't blow me away with friendliness either. Will go again sometime to give a proper tasting and review.. for now this will have to do."}
{"text":"Right of the bat, the server was friendly and outgoing.  We ordered a glass of wine, caprese,  and the calzone of week. We did a slight modification to the calzone and the server was happy to do it. The pizza was delicious. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in Las Vegas.Just like in NY City. I love going there on Mondays .This place in better that Grimalldies.the bartender is always,so respectful. I'm so happy to go there after work on Mondays. Be there next Monday"}
{"text":"Grab your fork and knife.  No slices here.  True Napolitano pizza in Vegas (or as close as you're gonna get without a trip to Italy).  So it's a small chain of restaurants, all good.  Quality ingredients atop a perfectly blistered, chewy, well seasoned crust served by a proud and friendly staff.  Win!    This is the real deal.  They even follow the the standards laid down by the Italian government that define such trivial things as the basic ingredients of the crust, its thickness, and the cooking temperature.  The Margherita DOC is excellent.  The standard to judge all Napolitano pizza by, a simple base of crushed, ripe, acidic tomatoes, fresh milky Mozzarella, fresh basil, and a splash of EVOO.  Near perfect.  The diavola with its fennel flavored, gently aged finnochiona, sweet roasted peppers, garlic and mozzarella equally good.  Too simple?  The pizza Capricciosa with its aged, porky porsciutto, oil poached artichoke hearts mushrooms olives basil all atop the same sweet, acidic tomato pure topped with fresh mozzarella, outstanding without being overloaded with toppings.  The only weakness, the namesake Settebello.  The sausage lacked the aged, umame flavor so characteristic in Italian cured meats.  A minor point considering.  Very inexpensive for the quality.  Now if they would just move the tables much closer, encourage chatting it up with your neighbors, get some disposable paper table coverings and serve an abundance of wine...."}
{"text":"The Settobello pizza was very delicious with the pine nuts for that extra kick.  The Diavola was good.  The Quatro was also good except the side with the olives, but I'm not much of an olive fan.  Overall, one of the better pizzas I've had.  Bollini in Monterey Park, CA is a little better if you like Napoletan pizzas."}
{"text":"It's always worth the trip to visit Henderson\" for a taste of the authentic Neapolitan Pizza!!  Settebello never ceases to amaze me on their creativity. The last pizza I ate was a Chorizo, potato, grilled onions, and mozzarella pizza it sounds crazy but it tasted delicious.  The desserts are pretty good here too, after dinner I find myself drinking mocha latte and enjoying the Strawberry Panna Cotta, it's simply devine.  The staff are always nice, including when it gets busy which is awesome!!  Overall just a great place to go when your hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. AMAZING pizza! Delicious panna cotta! Went 2 days in a row! Obsessed! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Setebello rivals any SF pizza joint, without question. It seems like Neapolitan pie is all the rage no matter where you turn in the US. Some pull it off better than others.   This location is \"out there\" if you live in LV proper, but perfect for folks in the 'burbs like my family. They don't have to get a sitter for the night and trek all the way to the Strip or Downtown for a nice meal.   Warning: Setebello gets packed between 6:30-8 pm! Even around Christmas, we had to wait a good 15-20 minutes to be seated. And no reservations for groups under 8 people. There's a small bar where you can have a cocktail and wait. They serve several wines by the glass and make a mean cocktail as well.  Pizza is well worth it! They really nail that Neapolitan crust - bubbly with just a pinch of black on the bottom. Always order the house special (if it's still available) and a Margherita. You can't go wrong with either.  Of all the fine dining experiences in Las Vegas, Setebello is a nice alternative. It's casual, family friendly and still serves gourmet pizza. You don't have to stress about parking or wearing anything shiny, just show up and expect to carb out a little. With wine, of course."}
{"text":"The best pizza in the United States.   Maybe the world.   Quirky service though,  (Millennial's ) you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Awesome hand crafted pizzas! Salads and wine selection are ok... But the pizzas are great! I love the spicy pepperoni! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     15/100 Michelle's Foodie Adventures - Eat Pray Loving my way through Vegas.  First stop, Settebello.   Been wanting to try this place out for a while now, and I finally did on my birthday!   Service was great -- server was patient, friendly and helpful with suggestions and questions.  The ambiance & decor was gorgeous -- loved the walls and the bathroom too!   It was a Saturday late afternoon and there was no wait.   I'm looking forward to trying their happy hour one day.    My favorites were the foccacia and the brisket pizza. These are both a MUST have if you haven't tried them before.   Foccacia - appetizer - soft pita-like? bread - you have to try it yourself. I tried searching Whole Foods, Trader Joes & most grocery stores for this... and Trader Joe's has foccacia but it's not the same.   The Brisket Pizza -- This was so flavorful. I haven't seen this concept anywhere else. If you love meat, this right here. You have to try it. Luckily my brother ordered it or I wouldn't have know how onoliscious this is. Better than the pizza I chose.    - If you can't decide between two pizzas then ask for half and half pizza, you can try both.    So far, this is my favorite pizza place in Vegas.   Other tidbits:  -there is a bar area with televisions.  - great for groups - in the District at Green Valley so there's shopping, movie theaters, parks, and casino near by. The District is gorgeous at night, great for a date night stroll. :-)  - after we ate here it inspired us to make some Italian / Napoletana inspired dishes.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here twice! the first time was great and customer service was ideal. the second time the customer service was slow and impersonal. i understood that they were busy, but it took 10 minutes to get our drinks back, 15 minutes to get our pizza ordered, and 25 minutes to get our check AFTER we asked for take out boxes. the pizza is always absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome sauce, awesome cheese, awesome dough. Quite authentic to what I remember having in Italy though not as thin.   I think it was around $12 for a pie. It takes 2 of them for me to consider myself \"full\". Tax and tip, you are at $30 a head on pizza (for me anyway)....but it's REAL good...will probably come back a couple times a year...will check out their location on Sahara in the SW of Vegas."}
{"text":"Been here three times, seems to be getting worse each time. I wish they could make a crispy pizza! The salads are under seasoned but not bad."}
{"text":"beautiful food with great eye-appeal and amazing flavors.   we started with the involtini -- thinly sliced prosciutto wrapped around baby arugula and goat cheese, drizzled with olive oil and aged balsamic then finished with shaved parmigiano-reggiano. gorgeous dish -- the peppery greens and creamy tang of the cheese were perfect foils for the rich, salty pork. well conceived, well executed and well received.   if you still have lingering doubts that quality ingredients carefully sourced make a huge difference, close your eyes and just smell your pizza (ours was the SETTEBELLO -- crushed tomatoes, fennel sausage, pancetta, roasted mushrooms, pine nuts, basil, mozzarella. the aroma from the toppings was pure pleasure.   here's the criticism -- not exactly love at first bite. i had some very serious problems with the texture.   their pizza's really soggy especially in the center. now, i understand that's a personal preference but pizza you can eat with a spoon's kind of a turn off for me. i'm sure the style is terribly traditional (and SETTEBELLO makes an awfully big deal about the authenticity of their pizza) but the wet, spongy crust was just tough to get passed.   ours was a little undercooked and the fact that we were the first customers of the day and that the oven probably hadn't come up to temperature didn't help. as much as i enjoyed the flavors, their pizza felt like wet cardboard in my mouth. still i gave them four stars -- yeah, it was that good."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, excellent crust. Super authentic. Relaxing atmosphere. Regular date night spot. Try the pannacotta !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, tied for best pizza in my heart. HIghly recommend. I eat here at least once a week!!!"}
{"text":"Report card grade: Exceeds Expectations  I am impressed. We were in Las Vegas for a night and were starvin' marvin for some dinner on a Sunday night. We asked the Trader Joes checkout lady where we should go. She said \"the pizza place on the corner of the Whole Foods shopping plaza.\" So off we went in search of pizza.   The front door displays several restaurant recognition stickers (Michelin, Zagat, Trip Advisor, etc.). We arrived and were greeted with a friendly staff. The menu is appetizers, salads, and pizza. No mas. We ordered a salad and pizza. Let me break it down for you.   Salad: Involtini di Prosciutto - Ingredients: Prosciutto Crudo Wrapped Around Baby Arugula and Goat Cheese. Topped With Goat Cheese, Shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction and Extra Virgin Olive Oil - Review: Had 4 slices of delicious, thinly sliced smoked proscuitto that really enhanced the salad. Balsamic reduction added a nice touch to the already flavorful lemon based oil dressing.  Pizza: Settebello - Ingredients: Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil - Review: Pancetta was thick and fatty. Yum. Fresh tomato sauce. Good combination of fresh flavors.   Got my fix of pork balanced with fresh ingredients. My stomach was full and happy."}
{"text":"Ok, without being the stick in the mud, I do admit that I am NOT really a fan of this style pizza.  It is supposed to be watery/runny/wet etc, and I don't really like that personally.  I've had it a few times, and even recently just to give it one more chance...but it's just not for ME.   With that being said, I will review JUST the DESSERTS lol :  Zeppole ($5.50): Fried Mini Donuts filled with Nutella & coated w/ Sugar. AMAZING! It doesn't get much better than this guys!!  I think about these every so often...I'd come back just for the Zeppole :)  Bella Mela ($7): Vanilla Mascarpone, Cinnamon Apples, Caramel Sauce, Powdered Sugar & Almonds. Delicious combination! Loved the crunchy apples and the caramel sauce.  Recommended.  Caramel Budino ($7): Caramel Pudding, Salted Caramel Sauce, Whipped Cream & Almond Orange Cookie. This was very sweet with all the caramel combined together but very tasty!  Just beware if you aren't a fan of overly sweet desserts.  S'mores Calzone ($7): Filled with Chocolate, Marshmallow & Powdered Sugar. Very sweet...super chocolaty. This was the least favorite dessert out of the 4 we tried.   So a cool trendy spot with a specific style of pizza that isn't for everyone...but at least the desserts are yummy!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Las Vegas, if not the entire west coast. If you are a fan of real pizza, then you will love Settebello's. I've been to the best places in NYC like Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, Patsy's etc. and Settebello is better than all of those places.  The crust is perfect, the tomato sauce is amazing. Really good pizza's.  There's not much else to say, I love this place."}
{"text":"I did come back and ordered a specialty \"Inferno\" pie that was on the chalkboard that day...and wow.  I wish it was a permanent staple.  I left so happy with my order it made my day.  It was literally so tasty I didn't want to share with my wife or in-laws...and didn't.  Service was great and it will definitely be a \"go-to\" sit down pizza place for us in the future...but they do offer carry-out as well."}
{"text":"I was turned on to settebello by my Italian professor in college (he was actually Italian and moved here from Italy, not just an American guy who spoke Italian). He said this was the one place he'd found that serves authentic Italian pizza. I went with my boyfriend and it remains some of my favorite pizza to date. Love this place."}
{"text":"Loved the Settlebello pizza!  The crust tasted super fresh with just the right amount of char on the bottom.  The toppings were the perfect combination.  The Diavola was a bit on the spicy side so we would probably not order that one again.  The restaurant is spacious and clean located in the District across from the Cheesecake Factory.  Service was prompt.  We will return to this pizzeria the next time we're in Vegas on the way to the Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and the fancy drinks. Everything is so fresh and fast. Great ambiance and the staff is pleasant."}
{"text":"They have the BEST pizza in Vegas !! The Margherita DOC is the best .... never fails !! Oh and by the way ... if one of the weekly specials on the board looks good ... GET IT .... they only serve them once a year :-)"}
{"text":"I go to both locations often. I get the plain Margarita pizza every-time. I've never been disappointed.  Service is great at both locations as is the food.  Atmosphere at both locations is also very pleasant. There is a special on Monday's at the Summerlin location. $5.00 for a  Plain Margarita Pizza (eat in only) It doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza place. It would have gotten 5 starts if we'd not been seated next to the Hostess desk which apparently was the place for servers to hang out and chat. I can, however, tell you where the best clubs are in Vegas for 20-somethings because of it.   Back to the food - highly, highly recommend. Pizzas were all fantastic (Margherita, Quattro Formaggi (sans Gorgonzola) and Settebello). The Misto plate was large with enough for sharing with the entire table. I ordered it as a main and it was too much food for me.   Service - great. Tam was our server and was attentive but not overbearing. Friendly and looked happy to be at work!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. It was very good. The salads and pizzas are perfect for two people to share. The kids meals come with a full-size pizza, drink and gelato for dessert. The kids meals were $6 which is quite affordable. The salad was one of the best I've had and the pizza was very good as well. Good value for Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat for authentic Italian. I recommend their pizzas and burrata."}
{"text":"Fresh, friendly and full of all things delicious. This place has become our family pizza joint, The kids pizza is a cheese pizza, a drink and a small gelato for only 6.99. Delisioso abd a deal.  My wif and I start with salads, I Love the Caprese.  The Lasagne pizza is my fav and the wifes is Diavola."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in the Continental USA. I lived in San Giuseppe Vesuviano, in province of Naples, Italy for 8 years, and I should know what I'm talking about. The true - only - pizza is the Margarita Pizza. In fact there is a place in Mergellina, Napoli, called \"Da Michele\", and that's all they serve (no pepperoni....) (the best pizza in Napoli). Let this be a pretext to my simple but effective review. Settebello's Margarita is subliminal, nostalgic. The crispness of the crust is unique, the texture of the San Marzano imported tomatoes is unnerving. The mozzarella is adequate (being imported it loses a little texture). The atmosphere is very suttle and reprises what you'd expect in Napoli (simple settings and not much else). Carmine, the owner, is from Castellamare, Napoli. And the thing I liked the most was the affordable pricing (10 bucks for an individual pizza). Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Hands down most Italian you can get without going to Italy! I love this place!! It is so authentic, and the atmosphere is a great! My favorite Appetizer is the misto. It is a great way to start the party. The only words I can use to describe this place are modern meets rustic meets the best pizza in America!!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome place to eat and relax!  We started with the appetizer cheese plate and s mini Misto meat plate.  The flavors were original Italian and very satisfying.  There were five of us, so we ordered the Carbonara Pizza and Diavola pizza which more traditional.  Both were light and delicious! We followed with a finale of Various Gelatos and Cannoli.  The whole experience was flavorful and and very delicious.  Before we left we were already talking about our next trip here!  Mitchell our server was very attentive and went out of his way to please! Come here even the price was astoundingly reasonable!"}
{"text":"After 2 years of living in Las Vegas ,  I'm going to go ahead and name Settebello my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas. No, it's no Joel Robuchon, but who can eat that every Tuesday anyways? Settebello is the restaurant I will insist to eat in every time I visit (if we ever leave Vegas!). Settebello is the restaurant I will cry about if it ever shuts down. It's my mid week pick me up, my pizza crack. Needless to say this place rocks!  Settebello is the awesome pizza place you thought you'd find in Italy but never did. The quality is insanely consistent (I've eaten here probably 50x and have never had a bad pie!). The employees are sweet. The prices are reasonable. Forget flying to Napoli to find that perfect pizza - pizza nirvana exists right here in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Service - Stellar.  Food - Not a fan. We ordered five pizzas.  The toppings slid off the pizza, the middle was watery.  Not to mention, they completely forgot my sons coloring book after offering him one and even my son's entree."}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed this place since it arrived! Cocktails are tasty, decent selection. I've enjoyed the Moscow mule varieties in particular. The salads are a must. Any pizza you get is gonna taste fantastic: customize it and be as happy as you want to be. Good attentive service and open atmosphere with an additional area to sit at the bar. Will continue to be a staple!"}
{"text":"Natalia was great.She is the restaurant manager and there was a problem with the ordering of the kids meals. We we're told the kids meals were drink, pizza and desert. When the waitress came back after we ate  she said sorry there is no more left for desert. She said sorry nothing we can do. But then Natalia came to the table and took care of the kids meals and said sorry for the inconvenience. I would of never gone back to there if it wasn't for Vanessa the waitress and natalia doing what they did and taking care of us. Food was awesome also."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients. They cook their pizza differently from your typical traditional pizza joint. However, they still met my pizza needs. I highly recommend anyone to try this place out."}
{"text":"Settebello's has ruined all other pizza places for me.    I may have to go back and reduce previous 5-star ratings to 4 star just because of how much better this product is.   Just wow.  I had the \"settebello\" pizza and it was perfect."}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic!  The Caprese was excellent.  Dessert was to die for!  The staff was fantastic.  The service was above and beyond.  The waiter kept bringing me things to try with my pizza.  He was personable and made the dinner that much better!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, gluten free!, soft and chewy, thin crust pizza. Can't go wrong here, salad was also tasty! Staff was friendly and helpful. Will definitely eat here again!"}

Featuring all the standards of a certified parlor, inclusive of a hand pressed di Sorrento brick oven, all wood firing, and imported flour worked by hand it was perhaps with a bit of gluttony that a the decision was made to sample four of the restaurant's four signature pies plus the weekly special but in the end each and every one was an individually shaped, lightly charred, bubbly and balanced success.  Truly a space where the concept of quality ingredients and time honored techniques yield a superior product it was with two golden, creamy arancini that the meal began and then progressing through pizza both red and white, simple and complex it was perhaps most telling that the best slices of the day belonged to the Margherita DOC with a the Buffala Mozz briny funk finding harmony in the hand crushed tomatoes yet not to be outdone the eponymous Settebello also shined as the novel pine nuts and mushrooms added an earthen undertone to the pairing of cured meats.  Truly a place where not a single savory was anything less than excellent it was without hesitation that desserts were selected and again choosing broadly the rewards were myriad; a creamy budino on par with DOCG's for best in town a clear favorite amongst many while the Bella Mela proved just as well conceptualized as the pizzas though ever more subtle - a characteristic ignored by both the Calzone and Zeppole; the first harkening a campfire's smoke and the second soft and supple but both filled to bursting chocolate decadence and all the better for it."}
{"text":"OMG!  I cannot express how happy my pizza made me!  I ordered the pear with jalapeño pizze and it only took one bite to realize how truly wonderful it is.  The artistry of making a true Naples style pizza is right here.  Their wood oven is one to die for.  The crust of pizze is Luke nothing I've had since I was in Italy.  Trust me, when I come back to Vegas, I'm coming here."}
{"text":"Off the strip but that will never keep me from coming here everytime I visit sin city  Came for happy hour, buy one get one free.  Epic deal.  Came up hard on four cocktails and 6 beers.   *note-must be seated in bar area and may not be beer from there Italian import menu.  Started with prosciutto appetizer which is wrapped in arugula and goat cheese.  Amazing with cocktails.   Second appetizer was the misto which is sliced cured italian meats, veggies and cheeses.  Went perfect with my pale ales.    Ordered Capricciosa with prosciutto, artichoke hearts, mushrooms and kalamata olives.   Bold flavor, good topping combination and very unique pizza.    also got their namesake, Settebello.  Pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, and toasted pine nuts!!  GET THIS PIZZA FIRST  'NUFF SAID  Sweet cream and hazelnut gelato and panna cotta for dessert.    Left settebello satisfied and smiling like a kid in a candy shop"}
{"text":"This place was very unique.  I had the Margarita Pizza.  It was pretty good. The ambience and location next to the movie theater was great.  I would recommend this place for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. I think it is the best in Las Vegas/Henderson it reminds me of Pizza I've had in Italy"}
{"text":"The best I have had in Vegas and I am comparing it to, Cosmopolitan secret pizza place, Grimaldis, rosati's, the pizza joint on Sahara and jones, and any others I have hit in Vegas this is in a league of its own   I tried the Settebello and the *Daviola those were so fresh and flavorful our bill was 29 bucks worth every bit of it  The girl waitresses had awesome eyelashes too"}
{"text":"Tonight was def an off night for this place. Our service started off great... But then it seemed like once 9 pm hit people were sent home and our server just couldn't hang with the multiple tables.  Pretty sad because our pizzas came out at different times (2 of us), and my box never came, our plates were never cleared (not even after our dessert had come).    The pizza was delicious though as usual. I hope they can get their game together during the 9-10 hour, especially for those arriving around 8:15."}
{"text":"I was in LV for a convention and I took my colleague on a 25 Minute Lyft ride to this place from the Vegas strip. He was poking fun at me because of my dedication to Neapolitan style Pizza. We went off peak and the place was deserted. I was silently praying that the Pizza was good and I won't be humiliated in front of my colleague. We were seated right away and we ordered beers, arancini and a couple of pies. The arancini was awesome and crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Then the marvel called Neapolitan Pizza arrived. My colleague, who is not a big foodie, shut up once we were brought the pie. Very authentic and cannot go wrong with any pie. They also have daily specials on the wall."}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff are friendly and helpful and the food is excellent. We shared the Settebello pizza and the Insalata Grande. The pizza was awesome. I loved the sauce, and the pine nuts on it added a nice texture and flavor. The salad was good, but less interesting than the pizza. I'd definitely go back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm a carnivore but I'm a fan of Margherita pizza - my test for true great pizza.  So the past few times I've been coming to Settebello, that's all I get.   I can usually eat an individual (12 inch) pizza by myself but that leaves me with no space for dessert. I've been meaning to try their Nutella pizza. A group of us decided to come here as soon as they opened at 11am and I finally got to try more than my usual green, white and red pizza.  We got started with an order of misto (charcuterie, cheese, olives and zucchini in olive oil) and caprese.  For pizzas, we got a margherita, vico, Genovese, quattro formaggi, capricciosa and settebello. We also had a Nutella pizza, cannoli, peach panna cotta and a scoop of vanilla gelato.  I'm not going into details with the charcuterie and cheese plate or the caprese since they basically, slice things and put on your plate...no special prep required.  I'm not going to discuss the margherita pizza either, all you have to know is that the crust for all their pizzas is yummy, thin and crisp - best eaten as soon as it gets served on your table. The toppings are from fresh quality ingredients and none of the synthetic stuff.  Vico: Sausage, fennel, mascarpone, fresh mozzarella, red onions, basil and EVOO. No crushed tomato sauce. 4/5  Genovese: Special pizza (not on the regular menu). Sausage, basil, caramelized onions, fresh mozzarella and shaved parmesan. No crushed tomato sauce. 5/5  Quattro Formaggi: Fontina, gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, Parmigiano with crushed tomato sauce. 4/5  Capricciosa: Prosciutto, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, Kalamata olives, basil, fresh mozzarella, EVOO and crushed tomato sauce. 4/5  Settebello: Pancetta, pine nuts, sausage, mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, basil, EVOO and crushed tomato sauce. 5/5  Nutella Pizza: Sliced bananas baked on a pizza crust drizzled with Nutella, topped with  and dusted with powdered sugar.  I added strawberries on mine to make it more interesting. I love Nutella but I was not impressed by this dessert.  The crust could have been sweeter and  more Nutella could have been added. Looks pretty in pictures though. 3/5  Service is always great here."}
{"text":"Settebello is one of those restaurants that you come to on weekday afternoon and find it filled with the Real Housewives of Summerlin. Pizza here is a fork and knife experience:  It's beautiful and impeccably decorated and full of cute (if I was 16, I'd say hot), young dudes. The space is filled with several booths and tables and a separate bar area. All of which are super comfy.  The menu is limited: there's pizza, salads, desserts, antipasti, and several wines. Pizzas range between $8-13.50 and are 12 inches. (Pro-tip: ask for it sliced, as this dish is served in traditional Napoli style).  My hot lunch date was my Gammy. She was pretty smitten with the boys & was flirting with them (and well received). You go, Gammy and you go, Glen Coco! We were promptly seated and our server was over in a jiffy. Drinks came the next second and pizza was ordered.  First and foremost, I am a simple pizza girl. I just like plain old cheese. I ordered the pizza with the Buffalo Mozzarella (I'm a sucker for it), basil, crushed tomatoes, some other cheeses, and oili. It was simple. The crust in the middle is very, very thin. Making oversized NYC foldable slices seem like reinforced bricks, hence the need for fork and knife. The dough was delicious. Crispy in the crust and gooey in the middle (not underdone bread gooey either). My Gammy got the Pizza Bolognese. It was so good, it smelt and tasted like spaghetti in pizza form. My Gammy was sad when she found out they didn't have any actual pasta dishes there. She loved the sauce and she's picky and a New Yorker.   Settebello has been on my list forever and I got to finally check it off and was not disappointed. Solid food, slightly inflated prices, lots of eye candy, and nice ambience. It's definitely a gem."}
{"text":"if you want true Italian pizza... this is the place you want to go.  pizza is thin and crisp and something so special.  if your looking for Pizza Hut this is not the place.  no supreme here.  I love the margarita pizza with prosciutto crudo or the sausage with pine nuts."}
{"text":"Settebello is one of my favourites spots ! They have a great bar with good cocktails. Their Happy Hour and Lunch Specials are when I like to go. Their menu is on the pricier side but I'll happily pay it if I'm there out of peak hours. They're open late which I loooooove. Panna cotta is a wonderful end to a delish meal!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Pizza! The salads were outstanding. We ate everything so fast I forgot to take photos. Tyler who was our server, gladly brought us another table's pizza (real quick) so I could take a photo of it. I love the thin crust Italian style pizza. Great options to choose from. Bellini's on Sunday with numerous options.. I chose Passion fruit ;-). If you like traditional Italian Pizza, get your slice at Settebello! This was a true Sunday Funday!"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place from a friend. It was not my cup of tea at all. But my wife loved it. So that's the 2 star. I would give 1, she would give 4.  I prefer grimaldi's to this place hands down. This pizza was falling apart and wet. Everything but the crust was swimming in the crushed tomato juice. There isn't really any \"sauce\". It's just crushed tomatoes and all that juice is literally dripping off the pizza. The crust was charred, in a bad way. If I have it my way, I'll never be back.  If my wife has it her way she would come back frequently. To each their own I guess.  Give me classic new york style at grimaldi's, give her this pretentious pizza with Italian names and fancy ingredients.  Besides, $14 for a personal size pizza? Really?"}
{"text":"Is this what pizza is truly like in Italy? If so, I'm moving there! This pizza is delicious - fresh cheese, smokey crust and all. The salads are refreshing. The happy hour is amazing... $5 mini pizzas and great drink specials. I love the location: it's on the side of the District near Whole Foods. Not quite a 5 star experience for me as I haven't always had the best service... usually that just means I wait longer than I'd like for drinks. And they don't have my favorite dessert anymore, the Dream Bomba. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you're better off because they don't have it anymore since switching distributors. This place maybe slightly overrated but it is delicious and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"It's great place if you like individual pizza but don't go expecting one pizza will be enough to feed multiple people (they do tell you that beforehand thankfully).  We started with the flat bread appetizer which was good and is about the same size of the pizzas. For our main course we shared this pizza (which I can't remember or pronounce) but it had artichokes and olives. I didn't remember seeing ham or pork on the description but if I did I wish I could've asked for it to be on only half of it. At least my boyfriend likes it. :)  We did share a dessert as well. It was a lemon pastry covered in powdered sugar. It was really good but I'm now curious how good their popular one is.  I forgot to add how the service is friendly and helpful especially since I can't say anything on the menu correctly.   Overall, it's a nice place to eat pizza if you're on a date with your significant other."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST PIZZA in Las  Vegas.  This is the way a real pizza should be. I was born and raised in Italy and I know very well my Italian food. I am also a very picky eater and I do not go around giving 5 stars. All their appetizers are wonderful as well, very original and amazing taste.  You WON my heart."}
{"text":"I know I will probably get some heat from my fellow Yelpers for this review, but this was honestly one of the worst meals I have had and I literally had to pull in to the Taco Bell after I left this place to get something to eat because I was so hungry.  I went here last night with high hopes. I was in a party of 4 total. We sat in the back room which was kind of like having our own private room, so that was a nice perk. In my party of 4 we did order drinks. The waitress was nice but had no idea about the scotches on the menu and had a really hard time taking this order. She had to go to the bar and bring out 3 or 4 bottles so she could remember what she was doing. We ended up ordering 2 double shots of 2 different kinds of Scotch, 3 beers and a glass of wine.  For the appetizer we shared the Arancini. It only came with 2 so each person got like 2 bites. These were absolutely flavorless and the inside was pure mush. The only thing that was in tact was the frozen peas that were barely warm. I should mention that there was a hint of red pepper after taste.  The waitress suggested that we order 2 salads, each couple could share. Great- the first couple ordered the Insalata Grande: Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vinaigrette. The second couple ordered the Beet Salad, which had a ton of arugula. few beets, tablespoon of goat cheese and no dressing. he first couple seemed to like the salad just fine. Our salad was not good, it was like eating dried grass without dressing.  Before we could even finish our salads, they brought out our pizzas. What??? You couldn't even wait until we finished. Your restaurant was totally dead on a Saturday night. It's not like you needed the table. Why the rush?  Back to the pizzas. We each order our own because the waitress said they were very small and we could all eat a whole one. We ordered 2 Margherita DOC: Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 Vico (No Crushed Tomatoes): Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and 1 with salami and cheese (they do not have pepperoni here and will give you salami if you order it).  Everyone started to dig in on the pizzas and all looked at each other like what the hell is this? The first couple were so hungry that they went ahead and ate theirs. The BF hesitated to eat his and I could no way eat another bite. This was the worst COLD pizza I have ever had. We waited for the waitress that did not come back for a while. The BF was so hungry he decided to go ahead and eat his but did not like it at all.   When the waitress finally showed back up I told her this was the most flavorless, disgusting cold pizza I have ever had. It also looked liked someone had poured a cup of water in the middle of it. The waitress informed me that  Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella is a watery cheese. LOL!! Oh and let me also say that all of the pizzas were burned (like charred black on the bottom). Yes--I know these are cooked in a brick oven but burnt is burnt people. So as I am telling the waitress how much I hated this pizza, she is making up a to go box. I am trying to hand her my pizza to get rid of it and she asked me if I would like to take it home. WHAT?? Did you even listen to what I just said? WAKE UP!!  No I don't want this nasty pizza now and I certainly am not going to want it at home.  She took it away and when she walked in to the kitchen she must have said something because everyone that was standing back there all turned around at once staring at me. RUDE!! She came back a few minutes later and said the manager was at the store but would take it off my check when he returned. I was surprised that the manager never came to my table to apologize or offer me something else.   So our check came and it was $166. Wow--that is outrageous for the quality of food we were just served. I have no problem paying for meals that are good and worth it. This was just plain gross. If the other people in our group weren't starving, they would have also sent back their pizzas.  Yes I am aware that this is a VPN certified restaurant. Just because you have the certificate does not mean you have good pizza. It is basically a marketing tool. For those that don't know the definition of VPN, it is as follows:  \"VPN\" is a designation given to qualifying pizzerias by the Naples-based Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana or its delegates  To qualify you must:     Make its pies with only certain types of ingredients     Use only approved equipment     Adhere to traditional pizza-making methods  There are parameters on: Oven temperature  How long the pizza is allowed to cook  What size and shape the final product should be  Final note is that I have spent many many months in Italy (all over). I am well aware of how this food should taste."}
{"text":"Was very curious on how good Settebello would be, wanted to try it since it was authenticated by the Italian pizza association. I know that they use double 00 Caputo flour, which is good for wood burning ovens. It was good but not great. The pizza is light and airy and thin. I prefer a thin New York style pizza. More a chewy bite with a slight crunch, like Grimaldis. two pizza, 1 salad and couple of drinks came out to be $46 for lunch before tip.   What I also didn't like was that the pizza's were preset, no topping choices. I guess, I prefer Americanized pizza over authentic Italian pizza."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here.  Everything is amazing.  I love the variety of pizzas.  There is something for everyone.    We usually stick with the Misto plate and a Margherita pizza.  Very much creatures of habit.  And for good reason.  They are always perfect! Luckily for my waist line and checkbook, this place is a bit of a drive for us, or we would be all the time."}
{"text":"Although I am teetering between a three and a four star review, I need to try it again in a few different circumstances to rate it higher. A friend and I came here to catch up over their happy hour from 3pm-6pm. Settebello offers 2-1 well drinks and non-craft beers and four different menu items. We got a mini margherita pizza and the piatto misto (both $5). The magherita was not to go nuts over. It was luke warm and the juice from the tomato made everything slide right off. The marinaded veggies with pizza crust cut up into pita chips was a light snack with much flavor. We also got the Insalata Grande, not on the HH list. It needed to be doctored up with more balsamic, but I enjoyed it. The pine nuts, fresh slivers of parm, tomatoes, olives, and mixed greens was plated in a generous portion. We finished with a Nutella Pizza, also not on their HH specials. It is best with fresh strawberries. In total, four dishes and two Anchor Steams, our bill came out to $33. It was an adequate amount of food, but my friend says that the food is better when you are not sitting at the bar.   Adrian, our bartender/server, was attentive and checked in often enough without disturbing us. I want to come back and sit in the restaurant to see how the food differs. Right now, I cannot agree that it is the best pizza I have come across."}
{"text":"It is perfect Italian breaded pizza. The sauce is close. The toppings are the most fake thing ever. If you're going to use American ham instead of Italian prosciutto tell the consumer. It is a complete bait switch with what they advertise as far as toppings. Why don't you just offer a pineapple and Canadian bacon because the supposed prosciutto is closer to Canadian bacon than it is the actual prosciutto. Very disappointed in the toppings. I don't give out too many poor reviews but I was very disappointed in this. Not even close to an average pizza Napoletana. A sad man leaving."}
{"text":"A really nice place. This place is true to its Italian roots and prepares food simply with high quality ingredients. The pizzas are prepared in the wood fired oven and are so simple in design, yet complex in flavor. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great pizza, which is something I would almost never say!"}
{"text":"If you know me personally, you know that I'm a die hard deep dish pizza kinda woman. So why on earth would I even agree to dine at a flat bread, thinly sliced pizza spot? Well, I'm a natural born foodie, so...no judgment and my theme is \"Bring on new experiences with food anytime, anywhere!\"  The bf and I were in town for a wedding so of course during our down time we wanna explore what Henderson has to offer when it comes to food and culture.   I honestly wasn't even hungry at the time we showed up since we literally had breakfast 2 hours before but this is the kinda schedule you gotta be on if you're dating a FOODIE bodybuilder. :P  We ordered the Vico Pizza Pie which had Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. All those ingredients sound amazeballs, don't they? Well, they sure were!  One thing that was off though was that our waitress told us that they serve their pizza Napoli style which means we have to cut into our pizza with our own knives and forks and that they do pre-cut pizzas at the customer's request but it's not standard. Our pizza...came out cut for us? WTF. We're all about authenticity and we were looking forward to cutting into the pizza and into the soft \"wet\" center ourselves. Oh well, I'm not going to knock down a star just for that.   The pizza was seriously amazing (mascarpone and mozzarella me anytime baby) and I'd totally come back here to try some of their other pizzas or specials they have. :)"}
{"text":"Patrick is new but one of the best servers we've had here! Quick, helpful and really pleasant. The special this week is amazing; they are often great but this week was really tasty, we will probably come back for another tomorrow! It should move to the main menu..."}
{"text":"Our server Chris was incredible. He guided us through the menu and his recommendations were spot on. Yes, I know it's pizza however, each pizza has a unique flavor and taste profile. My favorite is the \"Pizza Brisket\" the 48-hour sous-vide slow cooked brisket is AMAZING!!! with the caramelized onions is a must try."}
{"text":"Authentic pizza that tastes like Napoli in your mouth. Settebello is certified to make neopolitan pizzas, which is not very common. Most of their ingredients come from Italy and even their wood oven is from Napoli too."}
{"text":"Personally,I love this type of pizza. A little wet in the middle with a chewy burnt crust. I've been to both locations and the food is equally as good. This one just happens to be closer to my house. Also, I really like the wait staff here. I wish I had asked the guy's name who waited on us tonight. He was so awesome. Made a great drink recommendation and was very enjoyable. Most pizzas average around $12. They are 12\" I believe. So consider them shareable or just a large personal ;)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was on point, and the staff were great. Overall, the food was of good quality. However, the pizza was boring.   It lacked flavor is the best way to put it. The only flavor that stood out was that of burning fire, like a marshmallow without the deliciousness of a mallow. I also enjoy my pizza crust crisp or at least the opposite of soggy. However, that's this style of pizza-- doughy in the center.   I won't be returning and not because of the service. The pizza was really that uneventful."}
{"text":"First in the door, early lunch, craving pizza.  The reviews are good so why not.  The misto is a sampling of italian style meats, some cheese, veggies served with focaccia.  This is delicious.  I could munch on this old day.  Serve with a good vino, and it makes you feel good all over.  Since I was with my husband, we decided to try two pizza's, he picked one and and I picked one and we shared.  While both were good, I think mine was excellent.  Of course we got the settebello, crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, pinenuts, mozzarela, basil and extra virgin olive oil. (my choice), and emilia, prosciutto cotto, panna fresh mozzarella, parmigiano reggiona, basil and extra virgin olive oil.   The crust is super thin and has a slight crispy bottom, the top flavors were a good mixture I must say, enjoyed, we ate every bite.  For a different type of pizza, a thin crust, this is an excellent choice.  Good service, good food."}
{"text":"I would put them in my Top 3 Best Pizza here in Sin City. Pizza was excellent all around, my only complaint was crust was somewhat dry but I am sure just a isolated incident. The taste reminded me somewhere between  Lomardi's in NYC and Sorbillo in Naples Italy. Ingredients were extremely fresh and pungent. Had the house special and it was amazing. Lots of complex flavors that compliment each other but dont overpower or cancel each other out. This is a must place to try whenever your here in Vegas for a few hours or several days. A++"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out, after reading all the great reviews, but was disappointed.  The service was great, but the food not so much.  I ordered the Margherita pizza.  The appearance was great, but it was extremely greasy and soggy."}
{"text":"2nd favorite pizza place in the Vegas Valley! It'd be first if it wasn't for prices. I don't feel like I'm eating bread with a little cheese.. it's REAL pizza!!!! The original Italian with perfect sized crust and fresh ingredients. The atmosphere is perfect as they spent good time and money on the decorations inside(brick wall, marble tables, etc)"}
{"text":"I had to come here after seeing the pictures on yelp. When I see a restaurant I have to try, I make every effort to go. Not having a car in Vegas is rough. The amount is been spending on uber and lyft eats up a lot of my food adventure expenses.   I came here with my manager and I ordered the Pete e Jalapeño without meat. I didn't realize we were sharing..sad. I could've simply ate the whole pie myself. I guess it's good I didn't since I've been munching all day. Her clients brought her so many goodies!   So this pizza. I'm so glad I came! This is so far the best brick oven pizza in Vegas. The dough was extremely chewy and fluffy and just perfect. The amount of charred pieces on the crust was perfect to stain my teeth. I just love smiling with chunks of pizza pieces. (Sarcasm) the pie was fabulous. The spread they used was way better than I imagined. It had a hint of sweetness.   I really wanted a pie with pesto but didn't see it on the menu."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were directed here by her Italian professor. Having lived most of her life in Italy, she said that Settebello offers the most authentic Italian cuisine in Henderson and Las Vegas. I am sure a few establishments on the Boulevard would protest, but based on flavor alone, I would have to agree. I grew up visiting the Italian restaurants along Federal Hill in Providence, and unless you are in New York, you probably cannot find more authentic Italian dishes in America.  Unlike those opulent Italian eateries of my youth, Settebello is simple. Tasteful country, dark wood tables in an upscale, modern open dinning area match the menu's simplicity - pizza, appetizers (antipasto and salad), and dessert. In a way this reminds me of classic American diners, where In-N-Out draws its inspiration from. A few dedicated items, carefully prepared, creates a tastier, and in this case more authentic dish.  Any pizzaria west of the Mississippi is traditionally met with skepticism, but Settebello returns me home to the streets of Federal hill, thin crust, warm, authentic mozzarella, and refreshing tomato sauce.  When visiting Settebello you will feel at home in casual attire or business casual dress. The service is prompt, and for an open dinning area, the atmosphere is surprisingly quiet. My girlfriend and I were on our way to a film, and the pacing was perfectly comfortable as well as timely."}
{"text":"I would put Settebello in the top tier of pizza places for us. We've enjoyed just about everything we've tried. To top it off, we're less than a ten minute drive so those urges for pizza can easily be met. The service on our last trip kept our meal from being perfect.  We usually get one of the salads to start and if I don't go hog wild, one pizza is usually good enough for my wife and I still leaving room for dessert. They'll split the salads in two portions for you without request. My wife likes the Insalata Grande ($9) because she loves kalamata olives. The prosciutto platter ($13) is definitely recommended especially with the mozzarella di bufala ($6). The Settebello ($13) is one of our favorite pizzas and we always enjoy the tiramisu ($5.50) for dessert.  What was disappointing on our last visit was our Margherita DOC was brought out literally two minutes after we received our prosciutto platter. Not helping things was that the pie was under-cooked without any charring or blistering so by the time we got to it, things were a soggy room temperature mess. A little common sense with timing from the server and the problem could have been avoided especially when the pizzas only take a minute to fire.  We're hooked and we'll keep coming back. If you come and the service hits the mark, there's no doubt you'll have a great experience."}
{"text":"Taste, yummy. Quality ingredients, fast and friendly service. But, the price to size ratio wasn't anywhere near where it should be in my opinion. It's a little $14 pizza that I could devour by myself in just a few minutes.  So, if you like fancy, small pizzas then this place is for you. If you have a man sized appetite I'd suggest finding somewhere else to go for your pizza fix."}
{"text":"Good Italian Pizza.  If you want a pizza with pepperoni, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and quick!  We ordered 2 pies and they were out within 5 minutes.  They use a super hot oven that chars the pizza up perfectly.  They have many offerings and the dessert is great too."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this pizzeria, definitely not your typical greasy/tasteless Las Vegas pizza spot. Although the pizzeria doesn't quite approximate the pies of Venice and Northern Italy, they are certainly crispy, tasty, and clean. Toppings aren't the usual convoluted mess you find at CPK knock offs, just simple and delicious (e.g., good peppery salame, arugala, formaggio, etc). I've tried their salads as well, boring combinations and tasteless dressings - nothing to write home about. Also, pies are small and served individually much like you would find in Northern Italy; thus,  the pizzas are not pre-sliced (you either tear it with your hands or use a fork and knife, whatever floats your boat). You should definitely give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre pizza. I've tried this place two different times, with similar results. They don't know how to regulate their ovens, so their pizza comes out soggy. We had to send ours back two times and we gave up. They have excellent salads,  they are friendly and give good service. I understand Monday's are a good time to go...I'm not sure I have pizza forgiveness"}
{"text":"Yummie Great salad & awesome thin crust pizza. I don't even eat crust that much but there's is divine."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza I have ever had-period. Yes, it is a very THIN crust so if you try to hold a slice like you would a Pizza Hut slice, the toppings will fall off. Yes, some parts might be a little charred, but it adds to the flavor in my opinion. But the crust is amazing- they import the flour from Italy! The toppings are fresh and very flavourful, and the crushed tomatoes (sauce) is great. Be warned though that they do NOT slice the pizza unless you ask them to. They observe the traditional way it is done back in Italy, and it says so on the menu, so for those who whine about it, learn to read. Be thankful they even offer because if you brought your American butt to Italy and asked for it to be sliced you would be laughed at. Or thrown out.  Their Gellato is good, but try it on their Nutella Pizza (made with the actual Nutella from Europe, not the one sold here in America) and you might die. Of awesomeness."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. Very fresh and tasty. I can tell the ingredients are fresh and of high quality. The salads are delicious as well. I have tried most of them on the menu and have no complaints. Only thing that irritates me a bit is the service...that can be improved in my opinion. Besides that the pizza is worth a try."}
{"text":"Don't expect the \"large American servings\" and you won't be disappointed.  But do expect a simple menu with the authentic great taste of Italian food the way Italians make it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before with my family and every time the service and food is exceptional.   We went again today and the hostesses and the server came to the table every few minutes to ask if we need anything or if we wanted drink refills. Server gave recommendations and did his best to help us decide what to get. Exceptional service.   Now the food, my dad ordered the Diavola pizza and my brother got the kid's meal (kid's soda, 6\" cheese pizza, hazelnut gelatto.) and I got the Focaccia, great food, my only complaint is that the oregano on the focaccia was burnt because it was put on top before it was baked, I'd personally think that it would be better mixed into the dough.   Overall, very happy with everything, this place has the most authentic italian pizza that I've ever tried. Everything in the restaurant screams authentic (even the salt and pepper are from Italy). Must try if you're living in Vegas or just visiting!"}
{"text":"Pros: Server was amazing Super clean  Fast and hot  Smells amazing  Crushed Ice!!!!    Cons: Awful Pizza $19 for a small pizza with one topping  Greasy and Soggy They don't have pepperoni ...just salami  No lunch specials"}
{"text":"I love setebello, great pizza. Unfortunately this place has a problem, that white girl, her attitude is disgusting, i never received not a \" hi, how are you\" or a \" ill be there with you in a minute\" she never even offered me a menu after sitting at the bar for almost 10 minutes when a couple sat next right next to me they got the menu and service right away. Again, i love this place and their pizzas but the service was a big turn off. I hope Mgmt takes proper action on her and stop her pretencious, arrogant attitude."}
{"text":"I'm not going to retread everything that's already been said about Vera Pizza Napoletana. What I will say is that the smokiness of the charred  upskirt of the crust, the tart freshness of the San Marzano tomatoes and the savory umami of the mozzarella go together perfectly, brought into harmony by a drizzle of EVOO and a bit of basil.  Apparently I have food shame issues, because my thing with Settebello is getting a pizza (always margherita) to go, getting into my car and wolfing it down right then and there. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I do know that Settebello is the best pizza I've eaten in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Only been here on Mondays with the $5 Margherita pizzas. Those are totally worth it. Not sure if I'd come here on any day but Monday. Pizza itself is wonderful. Thin slices of deliciousness. Love how fast the pizzas come out to the table because they cook them real hot."}
{"text":"Again, I love this place.  Husband wasn't that thrilled with my choice until he bit into his settebello pizza with sausage, pine nuts, mushrooms, etc.  THEN he decided I was right, this place is good food!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you are not into pizza! There is nothing else on the menu but pizza and some salads - but no other Italian dishes like pasta etc.  But you certainly get authentic high-quality Italian food!"}
{"text":"This is real roman pizza...not ny style, but with all the goods that make an original pie. Great ingredients and real flavorful tomato sauce...awesome crust."}
{"text":"drove out to settebellos  pizzeria on 4/14 while in vegas and it was worth the drive. We ordered the isalata grande (shared) and the settebello pizza. both very good. will definitely be back when in vegas again."}
{"text":"WOW!  Freakin awesome pizza!  My wife and I were in The District for a mid-afternoon walk...not even that hungry but since we only come here maybe once a month I HAD to try this place after reading so many rave reviews.  This didn't disappoint at all.  The reviews lived up to all the expectations and I already can't wait to go back to try all the other pies they have.    We just split the margherita w/ half of it topped w/ cured prosciutto and bite after bite was simply heaven.  I hope this place is successful.  Why the hell would anyone go to Metro after having this????"}
{"text":"I had been eagerly awaiting the opening of Settebello in Summerlin for some time now and jumped at the chance to go last Wednesday.  I thought their Henderson location was the best pizza I'd had in LV so that's what I expected.  It wasn't the same but it was still pretty good.  Let's start off with the restaurant itself.  The place is big compared to the original and they did an awesome job with the decor, open kitchen and cool bar area.  I look forward to coming back for happy hour multiple times.  $5 mini pizzas among other food deals from 3pm-6pm ensures that.    So my wife and I split the \"Panzanella\" salad (House Made Croutons, Cherry Tomato, Prosciutto Crisps, Red Onion, Fennel, Cucumber, Basil, Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Red Wine Vinaigrette) which was good as usual.  I really like the prosciutto crisps since they're basically super bacon bits and could've used more of them but no biggie.     Then the pizzas came out.  My wife got the Margherita DOC which was topped with fresh buffalo mozzarella as opposed to the regular cheese and well worth the $1-$2 upgrade.  I usually get the Settebello pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) but chose to get the Pizza Carbonara instead.  I should've stuck with the Settebello.  Why mess with perfection?  Pancetta, egg, mozzarella and crushed tomatoes just sounded so good but it didn't come together as well as I was hoping.  Funnily enough, when the waiter came to ask how everything was and we gave our obligatory \"fine\", he just comes out of nowhere and says \"Yeah.  I am kinda conflicted on the carbonara....\" and just walks away.  Hmmmmm.  Not enough pancetta or sauce and the crust wasn't as well done as I wanted it to be.  But after all, it was still pizza and it was good but not the best.  My wife's margherita was great.    I still have a lot of love for Settebello and look forward to bumping it up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"All right... So far, my 3 other reviews have gotten either 4-5 stars... and I'm not just giving the stars away... Settebello is a little hidden gem in the desert just waiting to be found... like a 10 karat diamond, colorless, flawless one to be exact...  I've heard several great things about this restaurant and FINALLY got a chance to taste the goodness!!  It's a flat bread pizza with a flakey crust.  Sinking your teeth into this mouth watering pizza was... simply.... AMAZING...  You can tell the ingredients are of finest, the cheese alone was, drop your jaw-ONO (as we say in Hawaii)...  Eric and I ordered the 2 most popular pizzas on the menu (12\") -although my memory gets me everytime and I can't remember the names...  they both have meat on it, so we requested both have half with meat (for him), half with no meat (for me)... It's not comparable to Papa Johns, California Pizza Kitchen, or TJ's...  Settebello is on a whole new level of it's own- far, FAR above those just listed.  I can't rave enough about it...  Nestled in the District in Henderson, it's a must try if you're in the neighborhood....and if you don't...tisk tisk, what a shame!!"}
{"text":"Was watching the Food Network on Friday and was craving pizza!  Went to Yelp! and found this place.  Why did it take me so long to check this place out?  Who knows but I'll definitely be back!    Had their special:  Settebello (Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood over roasted fennel sausage, roasted mushrooms, mozzarella, basil and what I thought was a nice touch... the toasted pine nuts!)  Yum!    We also ordered Del Cafone (Wood oven sausage, roasted peppers, roasted onions, mozzarella, and basil) -- this pizza has no tomato sauce which I personally like because I can actually taste the flavors of all the ingredients.  Sometimes the tomato sauce can over-power the taste of the roasted peppers & onions.   Our server, Joey, was very attentive and he's a GREAT singer too!  :-)"}
{"text":"Ok I realize this place is really popular and it's supposed to be just like pizza in Italy and all that.  This sort of pizza just isn't my cup of tea, but it was flavorful.  Don't hate me for not loving it, sorry yelpers.  The sauce is very light and there isn't much cheese at all (it's probably fresh), and the toppings are used sparingly.  I prefer lots of veggies and a tiny amount of salt from a little meat (or anchovies, yum), and this wasn't like that at all.  My husband had the margherita with prosciutto and roasted garlic, and I had the quattro stagioni.  I really loved the quality of the mushrooms on my pizza and the salame.  After a little bit my pizza got very soggy and it wasn't so good.  I also had an ensalate which wasn't remarkable as it was just lettuce and Parmesan, but it made me feel like I got some veggies in my diet.  This pizza is really similar to the meal we had at Enoteca, Mario Batali's restaurant at the Venetian that I absolutely hated.  Settebello is definitely better than Mario's establishment, and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I have been on a gluten free diet for a few years now. It makes it difficult to get great pizza. However in Las Vegas I am lucky to have more than a handful of choices. Many places buy the gluten free crust from a supplier, this is not the case at Settebello.   It used to be that you would need to call 24 hours in advance to get their gluten free pizzas, but that policy changed about 2 months ago, so you can now get it anytime.   Everyone in our party enjoyed our pizzas and appetizers and the service was excellent. I believe them that the crust was made in house and cooked very quickly and very hot. It was by far the best gluten-free crust I've ever had anywhere in the U.S. I had mine with Buffalo Mozzarella and it was great! I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Never a bad pizza pushed out of this oven.  Thin crust makes you feel like you are eating healthy.  This is our favorite pizza in Henderson.  Always try the pizza of the day. Happy hour is a plus too. They have mini pizzas for cheap!"}
{"text":"I am the type of individual who loves pictures to be able to see what the food looks like but unless you look on yelp that's gonna be your best resource.  The descriptions of all the pizzas sounded good so it was a little difficult to choose.  However we asked the waitress what was the popular and she mentioned the Diavola and Settebello. The boyfriend and I shared the Diavola, and we ordered it extra crispy and asked for it to be a white pizza instead of red.  My recommendation is if you're hungry ... don't share. One pizza is not enough for two (order your own ... plus you can try more options when you order two!)  Diavlo has a spicy kick to it which I loved, I wish it was a little spicier.   Extra crispy is the way to go.  If you get it original the crust is crispy but when you get towards the middle you will have to use a knife and fork to eat it, or fold it in half and bite into it because it's soft in the middle.  Our friends got both the Settebello, one got the original and the other got it as a white pizza.  I definitely liked it as a white pizza.  However I am a fan of white pizzas so it might be a little biased.  With that being said, the waitress said any pizza can be a white pizza and you can add or take off anything to your liking.   Saving the best for last ... the Bella Melo pizza for dessert was delicious.  Super sweet with caramel and apples.    Overall this place was a nice place for a group of friends to get together to share pizza and have good conversations."}
{"text":"Love Naples style pizza and this is the best outside of Italy that I have had! Highly recommend the Margherita DOC pie or Diavola as a second choice. Pizza comes out crisp and bubbling.  Can't wait to be back in town!"}
{"text":"We love going to this place. It's one of our laid back date night chill spots. The pizza is freshly made in a classic open stone pizza oven. The Napoletana style Pizza is thin crust but really nice and moist comes out steaming. We love the Diavolo which is the peppered salami. There's also a nice but small selection of wine and beer. It's a mellow warm atmosphere with friendly attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"My second favorite pizza place in the country! They have simple cheese pies or! Delicious new combinations of dressings and things you don't normally see in a pie. One of my favorites they have is the Involtini di Prosciutto! Prosciutto wrapped around baby arugula and goat cheese. With more cheese shaved on top balsamic and olive oil on top. You can never go wrong with the cheese pie. Which one person can eat themselves! Or order a couple and share. I love the little marks the food gets because it comes straight from the oven. Such delicious tasting food! They are busy! I've never had to wait long for a table though. They have an awesome menu so no matter what you pick I am sure you will enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Margherita pizza at this place tasted so close to what we had in Napoli. I have been looking for a spot, where I can have an authentic Napoletana pizza and this place came really close. Although, the middle part of the pizza was a little soft and soggy and the crust was slightly burnt, which added a bitter taste to the pizza. I can overlook those tiny flaws.   However, I cannot overlook the non-attentive or shall I say non-existent server. We're not in Italia so I didn't expect the customer service to be lacking. Once the server got our order, we never saw the server again. We needed extra napkins and more water, but there was no sign of the server anywhere. There was a few people on the other side of the room that looked like they work there, but it was a bit awkward to flag them down since they were preoccupied with their conversations. There were only two other tables with customers along with ours and we were all pretty much ignored. The server came back when we were done with our food and at that point, we got the bill.  I don't think I'll be coming back here when I'm in Vegas?! It's such a shame since the pizza was so good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It gets a good rating for a reason. All of their pizzas are wood fired in a brick oven, which always gets brownie points. The pizza gets it's own unique taste from the oven and you can taste the quality.   The pizza: Every pizza is 12' regardless of what you order. The prices range from around 11 dollars up to 15ish and they not only have original marinara pizzas, but pesto and white as well. In fact, they have four white pizzas. They have other items on the menu as well, such as pasta, but really, who wants pasta when their pizza is so gosh darn amazing.  As said before, it's wood fired in their own brick oven and is sicilian style. The crust comes out chewy as expected and really picks up the oven taste. I ordered an Emilia, which is one of their white pizzas and not only the sauce,, but the cheese and meat.were cooked to perfection. I will go back many times to taste more.   Dessert: AMAZING. Almost All of their desserts are around the 5 dollar range. Their tarimasu was the best I've ever had. Usually you get an extremely small portion on it at restaurants, but not here. It is BAM in your face and huge. Oh, and delicious too. Pair it with espresso if you want to be in true heaven. Speaking of.  Espresso: If you are a coffee lover, I suggest trying their espresso. It is extremely high quality. That about sums it up really.  Service: This is also amazing. The waiters are friendly and professional. My drink (water) was never empty, but the staff didn't vug you TOO much. They were also more than happy to tell about the place and give recommendations to me, since it was my first time.   The only flaw, really, is that it's TOO good. There can be a wait time on the weekends, but it's worth it. Sooooo worth it."}
{"text":"Settebello....  Theresa B. and I went here after a long day of shopping. The place was very casual with pictures of different sites in Italy like Napoli, and even played Italian pop music. We ordered the Insalata, a salad which included mixed greens and a nice cheese that started with an P(Parmesan maybe? I forgot the real name...) For our main entree, we ordered the Quatro \"something\" thin-crust pizza (My Italian sucks!), which included salami, sausage, mushrooms, and calmata olives. However, Theresa B. isn't fond of olives, so we substituted with arugula instead. The food was delicious! The only bad thing was that they served the arugula uncooked on top of the pizza. I would have preferred that it be cooked with all the rest (Maybe it shrinks too much?).  This will not be the last time I venture to Settebello. When I'm craving for some authentic Neopolitan-style pizza, I will definitely come here...  -The pizzas are 12\" in size, and can feed 1-2 people. Most of them cost $11.99 each."}
{"text":"My family and I had a late lunch here and the place was hardly packed which was nice.  We started off with the insalata grande salad of mixed greens, fresh tomatoes, artichoke hearts, roasted mushrooms, olives, pine nuts, cracked pepper, shaved parmigiano reggiano topped with balsamic vinaigrette.  The salad was refreshing and delicious.  We ordered two pizzas - Margherita with crushed tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil and Settebello with crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil.  The pizzas were light and thin crusted, and the toppings were fresh and flavorful. The salad and pizza were delicious, and we'll dine here again when we're back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious! If you want pizza and such come here, other pizza places are budget, however this one is very fancy and delicious. I highly recommend the margarita DOC pizza and the tiramisu. Definitely come here and give it a try. Thanks for taking the time to read.   -Laberta"}
{"text":"Out with my Mom, sister, and niece, we wanted to go somewhere that would satisfy a craving for pizza but still appeal to our need for good, creative food.   Service was fast and friendly for a Friday lunch. The waitress made recommendations we loved; from the wine to desserts, she was able to address all of our \"I am having a hard time choosing between ____________ and ____________. What wine do you have that is not too _________________ but will complement _________________?  She was on her game and catered to the adults as well as the three-year old firecracker sitting across from me.  Mangia! Mangia! The Caesar salad was tangy and bright and crisp. The cheese was sharp and the addition of the anchovies was a great salty bite (and that they offered them was a plus!).   The Misto plate (antipasto plate) was huge! Amazing options for meats and cheeses - four or five each! - and really creative olive and vegetable offerings. The perfect accompaniment to the salad.  Involtini di Prosciutto - Wrapped up a bit like a carpaccio canneloni (or a cannoli, but the inference to the sweet might throw someone off? I digress...), the arugula and goat cheese were wrapped in prosciutto, topped with olive oil, balsamic, a little sea salt, and more shaved cheese. Light, flavorful, and perfectly fresh, you get the bite from the greens, the creamy sharpness of the cheese, and the salty velvet of the meat all in one bite. If I had nothing else at this meal, I would have been supremely happy. This will be easily become a staple for me.  Mom, sis, and the kiddo had pizzas. I tried the toppings of the Quattro (think 4 different pizzas, served on one pie in quadrants) and one of their prosciutto specials and found them to be very tasty. Loved the sauces, the cheese combinations, and the veg/protein options. Again with the fresh, fresh ingredients.  I didn't care for the cannoli. Not that it wasn't made well... but the cream had dried fruit in it and I am purist when it comes to certain things. I have to admit, I'd take the gun and leave the cannoli. The coffee, gelatos and cheesecake were great. Nothing unique, but excellent nonetheless.  A solid, tasty, perfectly executed meal with lots of options, fantastic service, and good pricing (2 huge pizzas, misto, salad, prosciutto, desserts, wine and coffees... for $90?)."}
{"text":"very good pizza.  my son ate 3 pizza's himself.  he's a really picky eater.  next time were in the henderson area, we will probably be back."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. Especially the Margherita! The pizza is fresh, made-to-order and the dough is so soft and delicious. If you can make it for Happy Hour or Margherita Monday, you won't be able to beat the price!"}
{"text":"Settebello has arrived on my side of town and I couldn't be happier.  Joining Bachi Burger, 808 Tapas, Firefly, and yes, Jollibee (halo-halo, y'all) in Village Square just means that there are even more options for some great food in one spot.  You can plan a date night with dinner, movie, and dessert in one spot (ColdStone Creamery is here, too).   My friends and I arrived on Friday night at 5:30pm because I was hoping to catch Happy Hour, but alas, Happy Hour at this location is Sunday-Thursday only.  Nonetheless, we still had a fabulous meal with great service.  The place only had two other parties seated at that time, but then it filled up by the time we left.  I had the arancini to start and the Margherita with mushrooms--carb city!  I only had room for two slices of the pizza, but I'm enjoying the leftovers.  The new location is sleek and modern inside with a view of the wood-burning stove from most of the dining room.  Their pizza is not for everyone, especially if you like Americanized pies from Pizza Hut or Dominoes.  This pizza is authentic Napoli-style with most ingredients imported from Italy.  If you've never had Settebello's pizza, now's the time to give it a try, especially if you live in the 'hood, too.  Mangia!"}
{"text":"OH MY LORD!!! I HAVE DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN!!!!  I first had Settebello in Utah!! I was there with my boyfriend for work and we he had been the night before I arrive and said how amazing it was and that I would really like it!  Boy was he not kidding!!! I was there for only 2.5 days and we ate there 3 more times!!! It was amazing!! So amazing that on our way home we heard there was one in NV and tried to locate it, however it was too far out of our way!!!  Far out of our way?....yes, but that won't stop us!! We planned a trip to Vegas around Settebello!!! We actually ONLY went to Vegas so that we could go to Settebello!!! We were in Vegas for less than 2 days and ate there 3 times (must be our magic #)!!!  There is not a bad item on their menu!!! My favorites are their Caprese salad, margherita pizza and their marghertia pizza with sausage or salame!!! They also have Nutella pizza for dessert!!! A MUST!!!!!...and amazing gelato!!!!!  I just wish that they would open a location in Orange County.  We have a place near us like Settebello, but you really can't compete with perfection!!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food and great wine list. Food was prepared very well and you can tell it was fresh! But downside....the bartenders are EXTREMELY SLOW.   We walked in and there was a 10-15 minute wait..no worries! So my family and I went over to the bar to get a drink while we waited. Here's the catch by the time we got our drinks we were already seated. We are talking  20 minutes here...  But listen great food amazing atmosphere I always see someone I know when I go and I highly recommend it! It just takes a while to get drink! Haha"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, best in town that I've had. The ingredients are clearly top quality and the crust is perfect, the perfect balance between chewy and crisp. The toppings are balanced so that you can taste the different bits and everything isn't overpowered by tomato sauce. Their salads are excellent as well, though I think a bit pricey. The atmosphere is decent too, laid back."}
{"text":"Got the prosciutto wrapped arugula appetizer and the Settebello's pizza.   Amazing. The arugula had thin sliced mozzarella and this balsamic glaze that made it sweet, salty, and light.   The pizza was so thin I could see through it. Crust was crispy, the gobs of cheese melted in your mouth and the sausage was seasoned well with the right amount of heat.   Best pizza I've had in a long time. Don't waste any time, come here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The flavors just dance around on you palette. Like the just picked the tomatoes this morning. I am a huge Grimaldi's fan and this is like the grown up more refined version. This is a must try spot for the pizza Connoisseur.."}
{"text":"Four stars because while having lunch here today my first thoughts were that the establishment is beautiful while walking in, the staff is attentive and friendly and on Monday's you can get a pizza for $5.   The end crust of the pizza was good but the bottom of the pizza was so soggy and gross. I'd only give the pizza maybe two stars."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Settebello Pizzeria until my daughter went there on a date. She told me how good it was and that I needed to try it. She had a special birthday coming up, so we decided to throw her a surprise party at this location. The decor is really chic and cool. I love the big wood tables!  We went ahead and booked in advance and they have a private room you can use, however, it only holds roughly 15 people. We had a party of about 20 people so they took four tables and set up in a big square. Needless to say my daughter was surprised when we walked in and all her friends were sitting there.  I was approached right away by our young server who was very nice and conscientious about making sure everything ran smooth. We started out with some insalata which had a delicious balsalmic dressing followed by several Margherita DOC pizza's. All of the pizza's are wood fired with a thin crust. They range in price from about $9 - $14. Each pizza has eight slices and they come out of the oven piping hot which is how most people prefer their pizza. All of the ingredients are flown in from Italy including the tomatoes which if you have never been to Italy, the tomatoes are super juicy!! In addition, they feature a potato gnocchi which is one of the reasons that I will return is to try it. In addition, they have a full service bar for drinks. At the end of the meal they brought my daughter a dessert pizza for her birthday. It was the \"Nutella Pizza\" and it was really on the mark! The overall price for the party including salad, pizzas, wine was very reasonable and well worth it.  We all really enjoyed the food and the service was terrific. My advice to you is to plan on eating there instead of  \"to go\" since the pizza is made to order. I plan to return very soon and give the gnocchi a shot!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! It's always full for a reason. Top service (Tim was wonderful), pizza was absolutely mouth watering. Perfect combination of everything in it. We also tried the dessert. Can't remember the name but it's espresso with gelato inside. Will definitively come back and will crave it till next time!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff are very friendly, funny, & helpful. Totally my new favorite!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. Brick oven style with a perfectly crispy, thin crust. All the ingredients were fresh and the service was friendly and prompt.  Had the caprese salad before pizza and the only improvement would be a better balsamic could be offered. I will definitely be back anytime I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here  for years and I check in most times (obviously). I love this place and my kid loves this place. I like some of the new menu items and changes over the years.   Couple of things that kept me and my daughter from giving 5 stars  Bring back the Italian craft beers.   Bring back the chocolate syrup to make chocolate milk.   Please and thank you."}
{"text":"It pains me to give this two stars. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS OF ALL TIME. But my last experience was so terrible. The food was great but my server Brian was the worst server I've ever had in my life. Rude, never checked on us, then after I paid 26$ for bottomless bellinis he basically kicked us out. I am a regular here I know the hours and that it closes at 10. At 9 o'clock he apparently wanted to go home early because he told me the place is closed and it was time to go. Then when I asked for the manager Vanessa she never came to hear how terrible my server was. Unbelievable. The next day when telling a friend about my experience she told me Brian has served her before and was just as terrible to her party. Won't be back to this location that's a promise. Matt however is a great server."}
{"text":"I've found the perfect pizza here! Light, chewy crust with a wonderful wood fired smokiness begin this taste excursion. Simmering tomato sauce, fennel sausage and onions topped it off. The great thing about this place is that they stay true to the Napoli style pie. Bravo !"}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas and absolutely delicious. Had 2: pizza Pere e jalapeno and Diavlo - both were really good but Pere e jalapeno was unforgettable. Will definitely go back for that alone."}
{"text":"Ok, I am seriously on the fence about Settebello.  I mean, how could a place live up to all of the 5 star reviews?!  I have wanted to go here for what seems like forever, and I finally got the chance to stop in for a late lunch on a Tuesday afternoon.  I hear this place gets crowded - but you wouldn't know it from that day!  Maybe we chose the perfect time to go!  There were only a few other people in the place, most of which were in the bar area for happy hour.  We chose to sit in the main dining room (note: this place is SMALL), rather than in the bar or on the patio (still too hot for that).  Our server was friendly, but not super nice. Not sure if that makes sense, but she just seemed to be ready for her day to be over and going through the motions.    I was super excited to see the blood orange pellegrino on the menu!  The menu itself is pretty basic - about 10 different pizzas and maybe 7 appetizers.  We weren't super hungry, so we decided to share the small insalata and the quattro formaggio (4 cheese, gringos).  The salad was pretty basic, but really delicious.  It was a spring mix with a balsamic vinagrette and the best parmesan cheese slices EVER!  I could seriously just eat a wheel of that.  The pizza was really good as well.  I love the smoky flavor of the crust from the oven.  The 4 cheese pizza uses some strong cheese and not a ton of sauce, which makes for an awesome combo.  I will admit, the crust was a bit soggy, but I think that's to be expected.  Trust me when I say, I had absolutely no problems folding that slice and stuffing my face!  At first my Mom didn't really like it, but after a few bites she realized she was wrong and quickly fell in love!  Now, this could easily be a 5 star review.  BUT, our service was a bit shaky, even though we were her only table.  And I feel like it's a bit pricey - it was over $25 for my Mom and I to share a small salad, a small pizza and 2 drinks.  If the prices were lower, I could easily see me making this a regular stop.  One thing to note: there was happy hour in the bar area, and the sign advertised 1/2 priced cocktails and $5 mini pizzas, so maybe that is the time to hit this place up!"}
{"text":"Settebello is BY FAR my favorite pizza in town. It is super authentic and reminds me of pizza I had in Italy.   My newest discovery is their lunch special each day - you can get a Margherita pizza for $7 and the insalata grande for an additional $4. This is perfect to share (or you can get your own pizza and just share the salad).  This location is much larger than the one in Henderson. It's the original Vegas location, so that makes sense - but the Henderson restaurant is much closer to us and our go-to for pizza. However, we've found ourselves in Summerlin often lately and Settebello is always on our list of stops when hunger sets in."}
{"text":"Apparently this place has been hoppin' since the locals have saw on the news that Obama dropped by for a visit. And no that isn't why I decided to go! It's been on my to do list for a while.   Luckily when we got there we had just missed the \"Obama Rush\". We were seated right away.   Ordered: Vica - Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil  Diavola - Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil   The server was cool and pointed out that we had just ordered 2 white pizzas. He suggested we could ad tomato sauce to the Diaviola which ended up being pretty tasty.   Then we couldn't resist and ended up ordering 3 desserts.   They have 12 pizzas to choose from, all looked pretty damn good. I am also a huge fan of the thin crust.   Not a huge selection of wine's but it was just enough for a class pizza joint."}
{"text":"Super yummy!  Loved everything we ordered!  The Bellini was great & the peach sangria was awesome!  The staff was very friendly & made it one of our favorites now in Las Vegas!  We are going back next month & we can't wait to eat/drink up at the bar again!!!!!!  Awesome experience & great prices too!"}
{"text":"First the positives -  1. Their pizzas were tasty!  We had the Diavola and the Sausage and Rapini.  I would order both of them again.  2. Their dough was OUTSTANDING!  Now the negatives -  1. The Diavola, while tasty, was a bit wet and the cheese and toppings did not  stay on very well.  The Rapini pizza was missing something...maybe salt? 2. The service was good once someone came to our table.  We waited 5-10 minutes before a server appeared.  Overall, I would definitely make a return trip!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza cooked in a very hot oven.  Top shelf add ons. Authentic ingredients.   Gr8 salads and appetizers.  Cool bar w/outstanding bar menu.   Serviear movir movies.es.ce was good.  Reasonable prices.  Industrial ambience.  Near movie theaters."}
{"text":"Flavorful ingredients, ok that's the only good news because the pizza crust beneath was very floppy soggy. Now let's talk about the service. Jake was our server. He greeted us and knew from the onset that two of us were first time attendees, two were regulars. He explained a list of things, and gave us some time to look over the menu....lots of time. He was either a greedy server or the manager loaded him down with tables, because he was dashing past us like Hussein Bolt. When we flagged him down to order, he took the order and he later returned with two of the four pizzas. Half of our party began eating (please don't wait for us, it'll be out soon). We were still waiting 10 minutes later and flagged Jake down to ask where the other two pizzas were. His lame excuse was, \"they are just putting the arugula and meatballs on your pizzas. Really? Where did you go? The arugula plant out back? The meatball tree? So half of the food consumed, the second half of our order arrived. Unsatisfactory on all levels. One of us wanted a little more marinara for our pizza, Jake said it would be .50 for that. Really? Yep, he charged us!!! Bad tip from me and I'm a 20% guy. And a bad Yelp review"}
{"text":"Update: 3/3/18: Another visit with Tyler. Tried the Misto Appetizer Platter. Was very good. We would definitely order that again. Tried a Reutberger Dunkel & loved it. Stuck with the Settebello Pizza, adding olives to my half.  We also found out that the L'Ubriaco is wonderful served with the Mint Chocolate Chip Gelato, too! Another great trip thanks to our favorite server, Tyler, & the wonderful chefs at Settebello's!!! 8/14/17: We've returned again several times since my original post. Most of the time we get Tyler and his helper, Claire, both are very wonderful. We get better service here than we do in most upscale restaurants! The food is always amazing too!!! Tyler was our server today & was amazing as ever. We started with our usual Involtini which is just unbelievably amazing! Why can't all salads taste so great! Then we had our favorite Settebello Pizza which turned out just heavenly!!! Tyler suggested a new dessert called L'Ubriaco, a vanilla gelato with four different alcohols poured over it.  It is so amazing to taste, just absolutely dreamy!  It was a plus that my husband & I were sharing as the dessert was rather strong. We were discussing the wonderful flavors and that they would also go well with biscotti & Tyler kindly brought out a little bite of biscotti for us to try.  Tyler was truly wonderful! He never left us waiting or wanting for anything.  Thank you Tyler!!!"}
{"text":"Good service nice atmosphere but the pizza was very disappointing! It's was so so so so soggy all 3 pizzas!"}
{"text":"Monday is Margherita pizza day!!  $5!!!  The pizza is absolutely incredible. Today we paired it with a panzanella salad. It was fresh and crisp. The service is delightful!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I alway no what to order and they get it right all the time! FYI, this is no Metro Pizza or Grimaldi's Pizza. It is more on the ITalian side of the pizza world. The are part of the Vera Pizzaria Napoletana establishment.   My go to is the Margerhita with Italian Sausage and onion. I always ask for the vinegar and oil with my pizza. It's delish!  My one little gripe, and this is a small one is the service is a bit slow at times.   If you haven't gone you need to go!! It is my default when I don't know where to go in this town."}
{"text":"Love this place the pizzas are smaller one per person but really great flavor the jalapeño pear is my favorite and the Nutella with banana and strawberries is amazing for dessert."}
{"text":"Went for a quick  and light lunch before we headed over to Lake Mead.  Atmosphere/location: rustic, casual, cozy; located in a big outdoor mall/shopping area  Food: -Insalata Grande: we loved this salad, my Bf and shared it, they split it for you so it was convenient; the dressing was perfect, loved the olives and everything else -Settebello pizza: we shared this one too; the portion was just right for two of us since we wanted not-so-heavy lunch; the crust was okay, not too thick or thin, but a bit soggy and chewy; toppings were delicious!  Service: friendly, appropriate  We would definitely go back when we're in LV again."}
{"text":"very good pizza. I like the thin pizza throughout and small crust. It was easy to eat one pizza myself and not feel stuffed. Also, very nice location off Green Valley Parkway w/ nice shopping area outside. I think we ordered the Settobello pizza, Quattro Stagioni ,and the Pizza Lasagna. I would definitely come back for more pizza."}
{"text":"This is my family spot. Any time someone visits...we're here. A birthday in the family? We're here! Fathers Day? Were Here! Mothers day? bam..here!   If you're not into something a little bit different and just want your NY Pie or Chicago deep dish....you need to go across the street. But if you want to get full and eat a delicious Napoletana Pizza...this is your spot.   I usually order the Emilia. Italian Creme instead of the tomotoe sauce...prosciutto, cotto, mozarella, that fresh basil....mmm I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!   If I'm in the mood for red sauce...I'll order the Settebello,   This is the closest you'll get to tasting real italian pizza...and it's a lot cheaper than airfare. So thankful the summerlin Settebello opened. Now my family doesn't have to travel all the way to the Green Valley District for a taste of Italy."}
{"text":"I lived in Italy for 6 glorious months and I have been searching for Italian style pizza ever since I left. After 7 long years, I found it at Settebello! This is not your typical American pizza joint. You order your own individual pizza and you eat it Italian style, with a knife and fork (or they will slice it if you prefer). The ingredients are straight off the boat and that is what makes the pizza delicious! They get their meats from Salumi in Seattle, it's Mario Batali's father's cured meat shop. He spent months perfecting his art in Italy and you can taste the perfection!  The signature settebello pizza is a real gem. My husband usually orders it so I go with the pizza Bianca. It doesn't matter what you order, everything is a winner. There is always a special pizza of the week and if you get on their email list they will send you the specials in advance. This is dangerous because it makes me want to eat here every single day!   I have also had the pleasure of trying the salads. They are just as good as the pizza and they will gladly split them for you.   Since leaving Italy I have also been on the lookout for Italian gelato. Again, Settebello excels above the rest. The gelato is very authentic and  they have a special flavor every week. My favorite so far is the vanilla cinnamon, sounds crazy but it is crazy delicious!  The prices are a bit high, but they are flying the ingredients in from Italy for crying out loud! You don't need to buy a ticket to Italy to have authentic Italian pizza anymore, just stop by Settebello on your way home!"}
{"text":"Nice pizza with fresh ingredients and enjoyable flavor. I had a special which had a stuffed crust. Would definitely get it again.  Only downside: their water tastes very bad. I was thirsty but I couldn't bring myself to drink more of it. It tasted like it came out of an old sink.  Luckily the pizza more than makes up for that shortcoming."}
{"text":"What a delightful find. Looking for pizza and decided to give this place a try. So glad we did! Walked in, greeted by friendly staff and a nice, welcoming dining area. Seated promptly and our waitress came over immediately to bring menus and offer drinks. She was super friendly and very informative on ingredients and tastes of various items.   We ordered two pizzas (12\", thin crust, wood baked oven)--the margherita and the Vico. Both tasty, husband and son preferred the Vico. I loved the margherita. Yummy sauces and fresh ingredients. Nice & thin very foldable. We also got bruschetta as an appetizer and it was so good. It was a little different than normal as it used a pesto sauce base. Since I love pesto it was a definite winner!  I also got a beet salad sans goat cheese. Absolutely delicious.  For drinks it was waters, a diet coke, and I got a specialty cocktail--the scotch orchard. Very good, very well made, and totally worth the price ($12).  Bathrooms were a little odd--there was motion lighting in the main part of the bathroom and in each stall. So weird, but it worked. Down one star for the toilet paper on the wall--there was a hook on the wall next to the sink area where an unopened roll of tp was placed...assuming by staff for ease of changing for a later time?  Anyhow, slightly off putting to have tp chilling on the wall. Everything else is fantastic though!    Great place for pizza, I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the waiter Gordon made the best recommendations!!  The pizza crust was just amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The new Settebello Pizzeria Napoleotana in Las Vegas is a well-designed, intimate restaurant with beautiful wood and brick furnishings.  It feels much more authentic than the Henderson location and we appreciate how closer it is for us to eat here since we live in Las Vegas.  When my girlfriend and I walked in at about 3:00pm on a Friday, it was completely empty so we got seated right away with the table/booth of our choice.  Originally, our decision to come to the new Settebello was because of the happy hour that they offered from 3pm-6pm, however, there were only a few items on the menu that catered to a real happy hour deal.  The beer/wine/cocktails were $2.00 off the original price as well as a \"Mini Bite\" selection that went for $5.00.  It wasn't a very good happy hour, but if you're ever planning to go here between 3pm-6pm, maybe you can take advantage of the happy hour menu and knock a few dollars off your bill.  For drinks, I originally ordered their Mirror Pond Pale Ale on draft but soon found out that their tap wasn't working for it.  Instead, the bartender recommended the Le Freak Imperial IPA by Green Flash and it was delicious.  I was impressed that our waitress went out of her way to ask for a similar beer.  As an appetizer, we started off with the Piatto Misto which was part of the $5 Mini Bite Menu for HH and consisted of various cheeses and meats served with toasted, warm focaccia bread.  It was good for the price.  For entrées, I asked what pizza was closest to a meat lovers and the waitress recommended the signature Settebello pizza.  My girlfriend ordered the Margherita D.O.C. pizza for her main meal.  Both our pizzas came out in a reasonable time (~15 minutes) and looked absolutely stunning.  The Margherita D.O.C. displayed what a pizza would look like in Naples and my Settebello order smelled delicious and was nothing short of authentic.  The crust on my pizza was perfect:  crisp on the edges while soft but still structured towards the center.  The toppings were outstanding and the amount was enough to fill me up.  I did get a chance to try the Margherita D.O.C. pizza and it was such a velvety, melt-in-your-mouth experience that I may have to get that the next time we visit this place.  Overall, the experience here at Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana was fantastic.  We have been to the other location in Henderson but the newly opened branch served as a much better experience for us.  The only reason I knocked off one star was because of the limited happy hour menu, but honestly, if I could rate this place a 4.5, I totally would.  From the interior to the service and all the way to our pizzas, Settebello at The Lakes can be seen as one of our new, favorite pizza places here in town.  Bill Breakdown: (with HH)  Beer:  $7 Settebello: $13 Margherita D.O.C.: $12 Piatta Misto:  $5  Total:  ~$50.00 w/ tip."}
{"text":"I have been to this place three times and each time the service has gotten worse not better. Today they advertise five dollar pizza and they will claim they charged us 12 each  I asked for balsamic vinegar and waited 30 minutes I will give this place one more try"}
{"text":"So so good!!! We moved here 10 months ago and have been looking for a place just like this! The ambiance is fantastic - open dining area and a smaller bar area with tv. Liquor and a number of beers (incl drafts) to choose from. Pizza is outstanding - the crust is true Neapolitan and the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. We wanted dessert but we're too full - next time we're trying the fried donuts.   The only downside is that they don't deliver and aren't hooked up with DoorDash or similar company. So if you want it, you gotta go get it!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in Las Vegas and I'm pretty well traveled and love all pizza.     The service is always great (and even when it isn't the best someone always recognizes it and acknowledges it.)  I would always recommend this place and do take people who have never been here with me all the time."}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE! Stopped for a quick lunch with my coworker and each enjoyed an authentic Italian wood fired pizza that was TO DIE FOR.   The ambience of this place is modern but beautiful. Definitely would be a great spot for a fun family dinner or a cozy date night.   We each ordered the Diavola pizza because it sounded amazing... and it was! Incredible cheese, spicy meat, delicious tomatoes, chunks of garlic (hello!) and roasted red pepper. The crust was delicious and the flavor profile of the toppings was perfection! If I lived in the area, I'd be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Totally legitimate and tasty.  I thought had every iteration of pizza possible until now.  They import almost everything from Italy.  The oven,  flour, and cheeses comes from there.  They use San Marzano tomatoes, from Italy,  which is by far the tastiest all kinds.    The pizza is quite different from what you usually get in the US.  The crust is thin and deliciously chewy.  It is in accordance with the strict pizza guidelines from Naples."}
{"text":"Great Italian style pizza.  The \"settebello\" is my fav pizza with pancetta, sausage, & toasted pine nuts."}
{"text":"After trying Novecento, I knew I needed to try Settebello to determine if one was better than the other. I got margherita pizzas at both and I have to say I can't really pick one over the other. They both have fresh tasting ingredients and great crust. The things I do like better about Settebello is that they offer a happy hour menu, and I did prefer the salads here. I had the Romana salad which had Parmesan and goat cheese, artichoke hearts and prosciutto. Delicious! I'll probably keep going to both places, but if you prefer a nicer sit down restaurant with waiter service, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I got to Settebello around noon on a weekday, and there was a pretty good crowd; not full, but lively.  It's an informal place, with a glazed cement floor, dark brown with some black in a square geometric pattern.  The simple wood tables are completely bare.  An open kitchen contains a large wood burning pizza oven.  Fans attached to the black industrial ceiling provide air circulation.  Lots of windows give the place a bright and airy feeling.  I tried the eponymous Settebello pizza:  crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil.  The crust was thin and chewy, with black char spots on the bottom.  And the flavor!  I could have eaten the crust alone.  The crushed tomatoes tasted fresh, as did the mushrooms.  Small amounts of mozzarella and other toppings served as an accent to the crust.  This is one very good pizza.  Settebello pizzas are very different from the standard American pizza.  At Settebello, the crust is the star.  Toppings, including cheese, are applied sparingly; they play a supporting role.  I think this has disappointed some people, who came expecting one thing and got another.  Settebello is a good 20 minute drive from The Strip.  No pizza place is worth that kind of drive, but if you're nearby, it's definitely worth searching out."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the pizza with arugula- it gets really crowded for dinner and is a bit pricey but very yummy!"}
{"text":"I came here in my attempts to carpe diem on their HH deals. Hence, all orders were limited to their HH menu out of our choice.  Pizza Diavola (crushed tomatoes, red bell peppers, spicy salami, garlic, mozzarella, basil and olives) - 3 stars.   Pizza Vico (sausage, roasted fennel, mozzarella, basil, olives, red onions) - 3 stars.   Crostini con crudo (Prosciutto crudo and shaved parmesan) - 2 stars.   Crostata ricotta with nutella- 2 stars.   I'm generally a fan of a crisp crust, including the bottom having a slight crisp. The pizza was soggy, a bit too soft for my taste, and basically falling apart as soon as it was picked up. I think this could be a matter of preference, but I thought everything we had was OK."}
{"text":"Thank you Settebello's! You make THE BEST MARGARITA PIZZA (Get the D.O.C.) in Henderson! That's a complement from someone who frequently goes to gastronomic town in Italy and loves a true classic margarita. So hats off to you Settebello's, this is a delicious wood fired pie. Fluffy dough, fresh tomato sauce, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella cheese. Simple, quality ingredients utilized well."}
{"text":"Well, the hype is true!  And, Rod U. most recently, and many others before him, speak the truth.  Settebello serves great pizza.  Not just great Neapolitan pizza--great pizza, period!  Diane and I attended LJ's UYE here the end of last month, and I--a New York style Dom DeMarco's, Secret Pizza, and Biaggio's champion, and not one typically enamored by Neapolitan style pizza--was suitably impressed.    This is not your typical Pepperoni and sliced Mushrooms Pizza establishment.  But no matter!  The other fine Italian meats served here, Roasted Mushrooms, and outstanding Toasted Pine Nuts are just as satisfying.  As remarked by others, the ingredients imported from Italy are top of the line.  I loved the great flavorful slice of Italian ham Kevin P. was kind enough to extend me from his tantalizing order of Antipasto Misto.  And, the Soppressata I added to my Settebello was as spicy as my server said it would be.  My mouth was on fire!  And the spice lingered there, but in a pleasant, reminiscent sort of way.  My only complaint is that a 12-inch pizza is not enough for me--especially when the crust is relatively thin.  Settebello's pizza crust is not of the crisp cracker variety commonly found throughout Italy, but it is surely thinner than typical New York style pizza.    Yet my pizza was still hot and saucy, and I liked everything about it: the dough, Crushed Tomatoes that tasted like mild and wet Tomato Sauce, tangy Pancetta, relatively mild Wood Oven Sausage, in addition to the Roasted Mushrooms, Soppressata, and Toasted Pine nuts that delivered a nice crunch to a bite.  Only next time I might opt to add a milder Italian meat.  And I will likely order two pizzas for myself, and take half of one home after I have devoured the rest.  I know Diane will not object, because she may very well do the same.  When it comes to pizza, we do not mess around.  For dinner we usually order a large or extra large pizza apiece, eat as much as we can, and take the remainder home for at least lunch and sometimes also dinner the next day.  The only requirement is that the pizza must be superior in flavor, texture, and ingredients.  And, Settebello delivers on all counts!  The dough comes out of the super-hot oven with a little char for Neapolitan authenticity, but no char taste.  Diane, who is fussy about pizza (and most other foodstuffs) very much liked her Emilia Pizza, with ham, Mozzarella, and EVOO, even though she was skeptical going in.    To open, while awaiting the firing and presentation of my pizza, I also ordered an Insalata, and found the Radicchio to be somewhat bitter, but that is the nature of this beast.  Fresh mixed greens and a very good light Balsamic Vinaigrette overpowered the bitterness in any event, and the salad portion was quite generous.    Service was efficient and helpful.  The companionship of fellow Yelpers was enjoyable, and of course the food was great!  It was a fine and memorable UYE.  And, I plan to be back often to introduce other pizza aficionados with whom I am well acquainted, to the magical tastes that regularly emerge from the wood burning oven of Settebello."}
{"text":"Used to be the best pizza in town and we used to love it but the last few times we been there the pizza were very poor loaded... very little cheese and on the Bianca almost inexistent prosciutto ( plus I particularly asked to put more cheese after last times incidents) pity..."}
{"text":"When someone who doesn't really like pizza LOVES this pizza joint, you know it's gotta be something special.  Been here with friends several times now and the pizzas have always been consistently delicious.  The wait can be a little slow but every pizza I've had has hit the spot.  Standouts for me have included Margherita DOC, a pizza that's not listed online but contains pear, and a brisket pizza. Best part is to ask for the olive oil and their spicy oil to mop all the crust up with.  And then dessert pizza.  Imagine dessert pizza with cinnamon and marscapone and honey.  I don't think I need to say more. :) This is definitely one of the places I have on my recommendation list for any friends who come to town."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have delicious pizza.  The meat and cheese sampler plates are delectable.  I have been here at least a dozen times since the first time I tried it.  For a pizza place they are a little on the high end, but the atmosphere and product are great.  The lunch special and the happy hour are a great way to try the place on the cheap ($5 for pizza during happy hour).  This is one place that I keep in my restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"If you like thin crust wood fire pizza then this is the place to go. Ive been to their Salt Lake City location and the quality of food stays the same. Each Setebello branch have their own head chef so menus will vary. Can't go wrong with any pizza you order here. Try also their Arancini. The tomatoes are so sweet."}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Pizza was average.  Would not come back. There are better choices."}
{"text":"Ever since my favorite pizza place closed down, my family and I have been on the hunt for a phenomenal pizza.  I'm very picky about pizza and don't eat it often, but when I do, I only want the best.  Settebello makes a good pizza.  It was a good size and tasty.  It's not my first pick for pizza but it is the closest being here in Henderson.  Service is eh."}
{"text":"Everyone in my family loves this place.  I thought it was good but not great.  They have thin crust pizza cooked in authentic pizza ovens.  I'm more of a deep dish guy, but the pizza was still good.  I also got their meatball appetizer and they were delicious.  Next time I go back, I'm going to order extra to throw on my pizza."}
{"text":"For Napoli pizza, as close to authentic as u can get.  Owners are two brothers and a buddy that travelled to Italy and decided to bring Napoli pizza to vegas.  I did not know prior to coming, but the Italian government has an agency called VPN that will certify that you conform to their standards when making Napoli pizza.  Settebello is certified.  Their brick oven is from Napoli and two trainers were flown in from Italy, per the server.  In addition, on the way out, I noticed a dozen bags of flour with a Napoli branding.  Wow, authenticity is a priority here!  The pizza's crust was very thin, soft, and moist.  As other yelpers have reported, the crust is too soft to eat with your hands.  Eat with a fork and knife!  I enjoyed the experience of eating their very traditional pizza.  Temper your expectations on flavor.  Authentic Italian is not over the top....  Come here on a quiet day and appreciate Settebello's strive to be authentic.  Chat with the staff for background info on the process and enjoy their pizza!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews about this place we came to try it out. Well.... we were not disappointed.          I Love their pizza dough, one of the best.  The salads (Romana, Pere Prosciutto) were 4/5 The pizzas (Emilia, Capricciosa no crused tomatoes) were 5/5 The Sorendo mixed drink 5/5 The tiramisou 3/5 The nuttela banana pizza 5/5 The service was 4/5 The place was clean  Over all experience was outstanding. You know we will be back."}
{"text":"I from ca here visiting  my son in Henderson and they wanted pizza so we found this place and the pizza was great we had the Daviola and it was very good the only draw back was it could of used more cheese but it was enjoyable.  I would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Settebello makes the best pizza in Las Vegas, yes the best. I am partial to Neopolitan pizza and Settebello does not disappoint. Their menu is not extensive nor is their wine list, but I come here for pizza only. It's location in the district is perfect. If you can venture off the strip and have a craving for pizza without a doubt come to Settebello."}
{"text":"$12 for a beer??? Would've been nice to be informed that a beer costs twice what an expensive restaurant would charge.   The pizza quality has dropped a lot in the last few years as well."}
{"text":"Settobello is awesome classic Napoli style pizza. Everything is fresh,great quality and perfectly balanced. I enjoy eating a pizza and a salad time to time."}
{"text":"There's this amazing place that's small (according to me) and quaint. When you first walk in the door you can see the huge brick oven where the chefs are sliding things in and taking the goodness out.   We got the Settebello and the Nutella pizza along with some fresh minty drinks that I've forgotten the name of.   Everything was delicious as the hundreds if reviews already account for so stop reading and head on over!!"}
{"text":"if I could give it zero stars I would. awful awful awful.  VERY expensive - 2 pizzas, 2 salads $100. really?  not much sauce but tomato chunks instead,   gloppy cheese, almost like cottage cheese.   never go again."}
{"text":"Love the taste of Napoli style pizza! I have to say the pizza here is full of flavor! Started off with the Misto. Meat, cheese and veggie appetizer. So Good! All the pizzas are personal size, i believe he said 12\". We had the margarita pizza and added sausage and loved it. Our server was very friendly and helpful. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place has good pizza! I believe their claim to fame is they use New York water and flour from Italy.  I have eaten here a few times.... and I would recommend the caprese salad and the margherita pizza! and for dessert.... you have to have a cannoli!  The staff is friendly, but not always attentive."}
{"text":"Another fabulous dinner at Settebello. Decided to get it to go this time as it was Sunday and football was on. Started off with the Involtini di Prosciutto. Delicious!! Thin slices of prosciutto wrapped around arugula with fresh slices of shaved Parmesan and a drizzle of a balsamic vinegar sauce.  Instead of getting the \"settebello\" (my favorite), I decided to try the Capricciosa. I thought it was really good, my only complaint was the large pieces of artichoke hears. I wish they were a little smaller. The pizza was excellent otherwise and still hot when I got home. I love the Napoli style thin crust pizza here which is cooked very quickly in the brick oven. Yes, its a little pricey but for me definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out after hearing how a couple of my friends loved it so much.  I was so disappointed.  My pizza was so soggy that I couldn't even pick it up, and ended up eating it with a fork.  Also, not much cheese on it at all, just five or six small blobs here and there.  When I eat pizza I want cheese in every bite, and I don't want my bottom crust to be under cooked and soggy.  I guess this type of pizza is just not for me, I'll stick to my traditional pizzeria pizza."}
{"text":"Far off the strip comes a beautiful place at a movie strip mall.  Rustic and industrial, it has a bar vibe, but safe for families with young kids.  You got pizza, drinks, and beet salad - you have my attention.  1.  The pizza that I ordered, The Settebello: Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The crust was toasty with a medium crust.  The cheese was fantastic.  (4.5 stars)  2.  The Beet Salad - good portion, but I'll pass the next time.  (3.0 stars)  But the beet salad, the level of service (inattentive and flighty), and the cocktail I ordered (wrong twice)...lowers the rating of my experience.  Would I go back?  For the pizza, but I would sit in the bar stick with a beer.  Free parking."}
{"text":"This pizza was very good!  Apparently most of the ingredients that they use are imported directly from Italy.  The crust was my favorite part and the pizza is very thin crust which is good because I try to keep it light on the carbs.  The server was fantastic.  He must have come around to check on us at least 8 times.  We sat on the new patio outside when the sun was going down and it was very cool.  All around great place!"}
{"text":"To date, I've found no one in the Vegas valley who does Neapolitan pizza better than Settebello. Granted, they're not my favorite in the entire U.S. (Pepe's in New Haven, CT would take the cake there with their Everyman pricing and their variety of toppings/options), but they do what they do, and they do it consistently well.  Never once do we come here and wonder how flavorful or well-spiced or well-cooked our food I'd going to be. Obviously, they've found a formula and they're good at teaching their staff to prepare, cook, & serve their pizzas and salads to their exact specifications -- and I really dig that! I like not having to gamble on the expected tastiness of my lunch or dinner (coughBRIOcough).  For what they are, they're a tad bit on the pricey side, which I blame in part on the franchise (though I have no idea what the original location in SLC charges) and in part on the fact that the spot they chose is in The District, which is infamously in such debt as to be in foreclosure. I also blame this in part on the fancy-pants imported ingredients, but I guess one has to do all that to get one's \"Vera pizza napoletana\" certification. Yeah, not bloody likely, but anyway...  The pizzas are on the largish side for one person, but not quite enough for two. However, splitting a salad AND a pizza seems to be just the right amount of food without feeling uncomfortably full. My boyfriend do this every time we go and it's perfect (he's got a pretty healthy appetite, too). I can recommend anything on the whole menu, as long as you like the ingredients. I'm not a huge fan of sausage--yes, ha, ha--so I like to stick with the other meats. I won't eat mushrooms on pizza & they're happy to leave those off for me. If you're a pepperoni lover, try the peppered salami; it's the closest thing to pepperoni that they have there, and it's even SO much tastier!! They also have the best damn espresso & biscotti I've pretty much ever had.  My only semi-complaint about this place is the service, and then only sometimes. The kids (the servers look like they're barely halfway through high school, which in and of itself isn't a bad thing) are pretty nice and helpful most of the time, though you get the occasional one who's sulking around in a cloud of bummed-out-ness (I'm assuming because some girl/guy didn't smile at them in math class that morning) and thus doesn't seem to be super excited to be there serving you. That's fine with me, though -- I don't mind that as much as when they get super bored and hover over you like a hawk. For example, we went for dinner on July 4th and there weren't too many patrons, but several servers. No fewer than three of them came by no fewer than 5 times each while I was STILL EATING and wanted to take my plate. One guy literally came over and stood there as I swished my last bites of crust around in oil/vinegar on my plate and raised it to my mouth--which I did very slowly as I stared him down--so he could take it to the kitchen for something to do. Go fold some napkins, son! Go refill the condiment bottles! I could easily come up with a list of things you can do that doesn't include stalking me for my plate. Oy.  I'd knock half a star off for that, but Yelp still hasn't gotten with the program and allowed half stars. (Hint hint! Get with it!) Bottom line, I'll still keep coming back time after time for the most consistently delicious Neapolitan-style pizza in the valley, and the more-often-than-not good, friendly service!"}
{"text":"I'm so fancayyy, you already know.....  My husband heard good things about this place through co-workers and friends, so we decided to have lunch here one day before catching a movie next door. It was pretty quiet during a weekday, but there were a few people coming in to pick up their phone orders. Our server was very nice. We mentioned that it was our first time there and he explained the menu to us in detail, as well as what pizzas from Napoli were all about. We decided to share one pizza, but couldn't decide what to order. In my opinion, I feel like it's a bad sign when the menu is complicated and when I don't see anything appealing. Thankfully, our server tried his best to help us out. He asked us what kind of pizza we were looking for, and we replied, \"something with meat.\" I can't remember the name of the pizza (nor do I see it on their online menu), but he did suggest a cheese pizza made with meat sauce. He said that they don't have traditional pizzas like pepperoni or sausage. So we just went with his suggestion. We also ordered a salad and I believe it was called the Insalata. It was the simplest sounding one on the menu.  I must admit I am picky about my salads. The leafy greens that are used need to be dark green and fresh! Not light green with brown on the sides. That being said, they did use good quality greens! However, I didn't really like the vinaigrette on the salad, it tasted quite bland. I prefer my dressing to have at least some taste. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the pizza either. Yes, the ingredients were fresh and hot, but the pizza was hard to eat. The main problem was that the crust was very thin and with every bite, the ingredients would just fall off. Kind of felt like I was just eating crust most of the time and it was pretty messy. Thankfully, ordering dessert was a great idea. The Tiramisu was delicious and not too sweet. The coffee flavor wasn't overpowering (or lacking) like how it was at other restaurants. I thought it was funny how they put \"contains raw egg\" in the description on the dessert menu. When we asked our server about that, he said \"Well, it starts off with raw egg, then it gets mixed with....\" Umm ok, so that means a lot of dishes start off with raw egg, right??  Anyway, now I can say I finally tried it, but was not impressed. Fancy pizzas are definitely not for me. I will happily stick to my boring Pepperoni Pizzas, thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Great place if you like pizza as they taste sooo good but the panna cotta was nothing but good, no taste at all but medicine like and very heavy and the balsamic vinegar on top shouldn't be a young vinegar just out of a salad dressing , it should be aged and subtle . Other than that its a good place !"}
{"text":"After reading a glowing review in a past issue of Las Vegas Weekly and recently online through Yelp, I was really looking forward to checking out the $5 Happy Hour offerings at this Neapolitan-style pizzeria. We decided to go with the basics - the Calzone and the Margherita pizza. The personal-size calzone was tasty, however, the bottom quickly became a soggy mess in less than five and the top also lost its initial crunch!?!? The Margherita pizza was quite tasty with a light amount of sauce and cheese so that I could fully appreciate the chewy, slightly charred crust. The happy hour menu is a super duper deal for small appetites and budgets. I suppose if I lived in Henderson, I'd hit up this budget-friendly happy hour all the time, but it wasn't worth the drive from Vegas. Maybe The Lakes location has the same Happy Hour deal? The new location wasn't open last time I was in Vegas...  I feel service could be improved as: *We weren't greeted when we entered the restaurant, even though there were two employees chillin' at the hostess stand. *Our server/the bartender didn't check up on us. *We had to flag down our server/the bartender for our bill even though we were sitting around a while after we finished our food. Is neglect normal here, because I've eaten in bar areas of other restaurants and received plenty of service?!?!"}
{"text":"Settebello is pretty successful as an upscale, woodfire pizzeria.  Service was excellent; friendly and prompt.  Had a simple pizza with fresh mozzarella, spicy salami, and basil; very tasty.  I typically order pepperoni pizza, but loved the salami.  Makes pepperoni seem a little humdrum.    I liked the crushed tomatoes approach to the sauce, but I wish Settebello would rethink how much tomato juice they are allowing on the crust; I think they could stay true to their concept of pizza without letting it get overly soggy."}
{"text":"I haven't had a pizza here that I didn't enjoy. Not as good as Grimaldi's, but definitely my second favorite pizza place in town.   I I'm fanatical abotu pine nuts (pinons) and this place uses them liberally. Sometimes I'll ask them to add an egg on top when I'm feeling fancy. I usually like to ask for it to be cooked a little more  thoroughly to add a little crisp to the edges. I haven't had anything I haven't enjoyed here. Salads, pizzas, desserts. It's all good. The more toppings the better at this place."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Settebello for years and was excited that they opened another location closer to my side of town. I had the opportunity to have a meal with some fabulous fellow Yelpers last week and we had a five star meal, as expected. Since we had a larger party, we were able to order and share quite a few different pizzas and desserts.   We started with Arancini for our appetizer, which was good and opted for five different pizzas, the Margherita DOC, Settebello, Carbonara, Diavola and the special of the day which was a white pizza. My favorites were the Margherita, Settebello and Diavola, although all of them were great. The Diavola had a fantastic spiciness that I couldn't get enough of. The Margherita was simple, but perfectly made and showcased the quality ingredients that they use. The Settebello is the restaurant's namesake and has the perfect combination of flavors, and I can never say no to a pine nut. My least favorite was probably the white pizza, since it had quite a few more onions than I would have liked. It was lacking for me, but my tablemates seemed to love it quite a bit They do have weekly specials, so it's a good idea to check them out on Facebook or sign up online for their newsletter for updates.   Luckily, we were able to sample quite a few desserts as well while we were there. The Caramel Budino stole my heart the moment I read the description on the menu and it did not disappoint. This was one of the highlights of our meal for me. Flavorful and a great combination of flavors. The dessert pizza was heaven. Cinnamon, apples, caramel, powdered sugar served on their beautiful pizza dough. This was a great dessert as well. My second favorite of the day. The S'mores Calzone and Zeppoles didn't do much for me. They were good, but too sweet and chocolatey for my taste. That's probably just me, though.   As a fan of Settebello for so long, this meal lived up to all my fond memories of meals with friends at the Settebello in Henderson and makes me wonder why it took me so long between visits."}
{"text":"I can not believe that I have found this wonderful Pizzeria!  It brought back so many memories of living in Bella Napoli! We had an early lunch and it was not busy at all.  My husband has never had the Neapolitan  pizza but he loved the flavor.  I  hate that I have to travel 4 hours by plane to enjoy this ."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, very slow service.  Came here with my boyfriend and my parents for a late lunch. The total meal ended up taking almost 2 hours. The food was excellent; however, waiting so long for our meal was painful. Here's the breakdown:  Service: Our server was super nice; however, there seemed to be some kitchen issues. As I said above, it took almost 2 hours to get 3 pizzas, which is not acceptable, especially when the place wasn't busy at all.   Food: TASTY! The food quality and flavor is what earned this place 4 stars.  We ordered: 2 Settebellos- Amazing! Fresh ingredients and perfect thin crust.  1 Capricciosa- Delicious! I couldn't stop eating it. Every toping was fresh and of high quality. The dough was great. Thin and cooked perfectly. Softer in the center, but crispy on the crust. The sauce was delicate and complimented the toppings' flavors nicely.   1 Kid's Margherita with added prosciutto- my mom loved this! She ate all of it and she usually never finished anything. She kept raving about the favors even after we got home.  1 Rucola- Loved the dressing!  1 Beet Salad- I really enjoyed this, but it's a very different salad. The warm goat cheese was very good and so were the beets. You have to really like beets to enjoy this salad.   Atmosphere: Nice. Nothing special and much more on the casual side.   Prices: Great. I would actually pay a lot more than what they charge because the quality and flavor of the pizza is so excellent.  Overall, I will be back, but not when I'm in a hurry! Fantastic pizza and good salads. If you're in the mood for pizza and you like thin crust come here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: My friend and I came in during a slow part of the day as we were the only ones to sit down for an early dinner.  However the place looks like a really cool spot to be in once the sun goes down and more people start to come through.  The decor is very rustic which is nice and you can see the huge pizza over in the back of the restaurant.  FOOD:  The pizzas here are meant to be eaten individually (no large pizzas to be shared) and I'm not so sure if I'm a fan of this style.  I enjoy having a huge pizza in front of everyone and everyone getting a slice.  Regardless, these are Neapolitan style pizzas which have a much chewier center while the outsides are crisp.  It had a little too much chew for my liking, but what made the pizza great was the freshness of the ingredients.  I had the Capricciosa pizza and it was a great choice overall.    SERVICE:  Our server was nice enough to explain how Neapolitan pizza differs from other types and did a good job in explaining their options on the menu.  It was a well run service, nothing truly remarkable but certainly beats many other restaurants I've been to where the service truly lacked."}
{"text":"Everything has already been said, don't want to bore anyone with all compliments that come to my mind, but I'll say this: we come here at least two-three times a week from Summerlin. We brought 5 sets of friends, everyone loved it too, many of which are from the East coast.  For visitors with kids: there is a great Carousel right around the corner. Our kid can't wait to get there right after we are done with pizza."}
{"text":"k listen the jalepeno pear jam pizza was the best pizza i have ever had and i have been to italy people. changed. my  life. better than any other there!"}
{"text":"I discovered Settebello upon moving to the Las Vegas area for work about 7 months ago. I have become a regular! Settebello is an up and coming gem of the Summerlin area. The staff, from the manager, to the bartenders and servers, is friendly, down-to-earth and diligent.  The food is amazing. The pizza reminds me of stopping at that random family-owned restaurant along the streets of Florence or Rome. (They have high quality olive oil which is always a tell-tale sign)  They have a great wine and cocktail selection. (Best old-fashioned in Vegas, tied with Herbs and Rye) And their Happy Hour tops the whole thing off. This place is really great, I recommend it for everyone, whether its a family dinner or pizza and wine with your friends or significant other."}
{"text":"Delicious real Italian pizza!  Don't come expecting pepperoni and sausage.  Can get busy on weekends.  Happy hour is nice but I wish they offered the regular menu toppings on the mini pizzas.  Don't try to share a pizza - you'll want the whole thing to yourself!"}
