{"text":"Good authentic dim sum brunch spot! I do wish there were more rice crepe dishes available though. The shrimp ones that were going around were great."}
{"text":"Central Grand is a bit difficult to find, especially since there is more than one Chinese restaurant in the same building. Its cute how front entrance is decorated with pictures of the owners with celebrities who have visited the restaurant.( Karl Lagerfeld, Tom Ford, Jet Li to name a few...)  We had a reservation for a table of 8, thank goodness because the place was packed. The service was fast and efficient. Out of the seemingly hundreds of items, I particularly enjoyed the various shrimp ones.  Just to say I've done it, I had a chicken foot...I didnt like it one bit. Someone forgot to tell me there is bone inside, so after spitting that out on to my plate all lady like, I ate the skin part.  I can only describe it as a slimier version of KFC chicken skin. Very fatty, and squishy. The salt and pepper squid, egg tarts and egg buns are well worth the calories. The egg tarts are served very hot, and are less sweet that your typical dessert tart, they were the best part of the meal.  Im happy to be able to say that Ive finally tried Dim Sum. Its a relatively cheap meal, thats fun to share with friends, and I had a full stomach for only $17 with tip!"}
{"text":"Textbook Chinese restaurant with banquet facilities.  Located in an Asian mall, and so gets a lot of weekend traffic.  Decent preparation of standard a la carte Chinese dishes.  The highlight here has to be the dim sum, which is your traditional push-cart style, with good variety and you don't have to know a secret password to get the dipping sauces.  I have a penchant for egg tarts, and both this place and the bakery downstairs have excellent ones (though I give the edge to the bakery).  Free parking is a bonus for the pop-by dim summer vs. classic Chinatown joints."}
{"text":"My first impressions of this place was that it was very aesthetically pleasing and spacious. I loved the fish tank and the photographs of the celebrities and famous people.  The service was not exceptionally stellar, yet it was much better than at some other restaurants. However, I found the quality of the food to be rather appalling. Many of the steamed dumplings were overcooked and the wrappers had already burst and leaked out the juices and flavour. Also, the chicken feet did not look nor taste right. They are supposed to be deep fried and then marinated and steamed before serving. Yet, these feet looked like they had just been blanched and were flavourless. The crunch definitely was not right. We also had two rice crepes: the beef and the shrimp. I found the texture bland and it tasted reheated and just meh... I think the worst part was the egg tarts and baked buns. We ordered four plates of egg tarts and they did not taste nor look like egg tarts. Rather the appearance of undercooked curdled milk tarts which needed just a couple more minutes of oven time. The almond baked buns also seemed to taste a little yeasty... I am not sure if it was just an off day for the baked foods or...?  On the other hand, the salt and pepper squid tentacles were to die for! They were not hard and chewy like some places. They were the perfect texture and the crispy batter was not too salty or greasy. YUM! The sticky rice was also rather tasty. A little salty for me, but I loved how it was chock full of yummy good ingredients!   I did not enjoy the cart experience. I just watched the same old ladies pushing the same food back and forth around our section. Watching it get cold and watching as they put the dirty dishes right beneath the food that was waiting to go on someones table and into their mouths. Yuck. I think it didn't help that it was a not so busy week day and the food was not being kept fresh as a result...  Overall, my experience was under par. The food was mainly poor and overpriced (our lunch meal for 6 came to $130), but I did like the decor and service. However, it may just be I prefer ordering piping hot fresh dim sum off the menu instead of the carts..."}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't say I agree with the high reviews on here. Came here for dim sum with my friend. First, their washroom was out of order, so you had to use the one in the mall. The mall washroom was filthy, and wasn't stocked up. I understand that is not their fault, but still was not pleasant. We didn't have to wait long despite the restaurant being very busy, which was nice. When we were seated, it was obvious the table had not been cleaned, as there were grease marks all over it. The carts came by quite often, which was nice. But, most of the plates we got were cold and the dumplings fell apart the minute you picked them up. The only things I liked were the steamed pork buns and the taro root cake. I had high expectations as it seems to be quite popular. But, I was definitely let down. If I returned, it would only be for the steamed pork buns and taro root cake."}
{"text":"At Central Grand for special occasion meal.  12 courses of bland food.  Everything seemed under seasoned and/or over/under cooked.  Even simple dishes like vegetables were unappetizing.  From previous visit with an unsatisfactory dim sum meal , I won't be back."}
{"text":"Best dim sum I've had in Calgary so far. Fresh dishes, pleasant service and very quick. Parking can be a challenge but if you live nearby it is easy to get to on foot or by bus. Prices were a little higher than normal, so I will not be eating here as often as I would like to. The mall that Grand Central Restaurant is located in is sort of unkempt and grimy. So... go for the food, not the looks. Overall, I'll be back again sometime for Dim Sum."}
{"text":"I love dim sum, but I hate long waits so it's always such a connundrum for me.   However an afternoon on a weekday temporarily solved this little problem. My family and a few guests headed to Central Grand for celebratory lunch, and surprisingly our table of 8 were seated right away.  Best part of dim sum? The carts of food being pushed about so not only do you get to see your food, you get to start eating right away! The dishes here are always fresh and you have the option to order anything off their menu if it hasn't been carted around yet.  I'd be up for a midweek dim sum here again but you definitely won't catch me here on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Chinese wedding a few weekends ago. The manager/owner (not entirely sure of his position but he was clearly in charge) was so incredibly rude. He yelled at the dancers, in front of the head table, for bumping his cheap chandelier with the head of their dragon costume. Was rude to guests, barking orders at the wait staff and seemed pissed off to have guests in his restaurant. The wait staff were unbelievably rude, no grace at all when bringing dishes to the tables, and I even saw one waitress spending a good 10 minutes clipping her nails in the kitchen...I couldn't believe it! The bathrooms were disgusting, couldn't imagine what the kitchen looked like.Will never come here again...gross!"}
{"text":"This is a great authentic Chinese restaurant. I went here for a work function - we were entertaining some visitors from China and a co-worker suggested this restaurant. We ordered the dinner for ten with the Peking Duck. The duck was delicious. We also had a vegetable dish with shrimp, duck soup, some shrimp skewers, shitake mushrooms with bok choy, creamy lobster and crab, duck fried rice, garlic chicken, steamed sweet and sour fish and sweet red bean soup with lotus seeds for dessert.   There was so much food and endless tea. We had our own separate room and the waiter would knock before he entered with a course, which I thought was cute. The walls are covered (and I mean covered) with pictures of famous people who have visited the restaurant.  The food was delicious and we were able to pack up the leftovers. It is a bit pricey, but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"4.5 stars this restaurant is one of the few that Dim Sum carts, very traditional way of serving. You get to see what you are getting. They are very consistent with the quality of the food that they put out. Every Resturant that do Dim Sum have some different stuff that other restaurants don't offer or different variation of the basic stuff. If love Dim Sum it's worth trying."}
{"text":"Parking s always an issue but when u get passed dat - its like dim sum heaven on a cart. I think its my fav place for dim sum in Calgary. Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Central Grand is one of my favorite places for Dim Sum in Calgary for a number of reasons.  1. The food is a la cart, but if you are wanting something that hasn't come around in a while you can flag down one of the waiters and order it.   2. It's busy during dim sum on the weekends which means the food in the cart is hot and fresh  Although most of the dim sum offerings are good, there are a few that I have to get every single time we go because they're excellent:  - Har gow/ shrimp dumplings  - Tripe: Their tripe turned me into a tripe-lover. It's tender with a delicious garlicy sauce  - Egg tarts: always warm, fresh, and not overly sweet  - Almond bun: soft white bun filled with almond cream  - Sticky Rice wrapped in leaves  -Salt and pepper squid: As long as its fresh and hot. Once or twice we've gotten a cold plate of it and it was left uneaten at the end of the meal.   I take a pass on the pan fried turnip cake because I find their version to be a little bland and skimpy on the add-ins. Otherwise I'll happily eat anything they offer."}
{"text":"We only went here because our usual spot was closed due to City issues beyond their control. The food was not bad but not great. Some dishes were quite flavourful, but not to our full expectation of great dim sum. Service was lacking and we only got certain dishes right at the end even though the carts went around several times. Would we go back: no. We will stick with our regular dim sum place."}
{"text":"We attended a birthday banquet and was presented with a standard Chinese banquet 10-course set menu (steamed fish, birdnest soup, chicken, 3-style appetizer, long life noodles etc). Maybe because it was a set menu and a larger party, the dishes didn't seem freshly prepared, except for the birthday bun (very good). Taste of the dishes was mediocre and unremarkable. The service was a little disappointing as one of the servers was extremely rude when we requested for water and other items.  We ended up changing our own plates after several courses when it became pretty clear the server had no intention of doing it. The interiors seemed a little awkwardly laid but they did have more than one private room for small private parties. Tip: park in the rear or upstairs lot (limited spots though)."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed with the current quality of the food. Bland and boring, not what your looking to have for dim sum.   Add to the equation, rude and ignorant staff, from the front desk to the servers, and this is a formerly good restaurant that has just hit my boycott list.   Oh, and when the 'seating' arrangement issues were discussed with management, they ended up being the root of the problem. Completely inappropriate and unapologetic. We will be going to other better restaurants who actually appreciate the business.   Ymmv, but be prepared for bland tasteless food, long periods of abandonment and ignorant staff."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner for my family and I, the food was not very good and was served extremely late. The waitress was extremely rude and just threw our food on the table. When I went to pay I didnt leave a tip and the rude waitress kept saying wheres the tip, to which I replied the food isn't that good and service was lacking. She said get out and don't come back. Here I am now sitting here writing this review and I'm looking at the reciept, the prices were higher than what the menu stated. Overall this restuarant is absolute terrible, waiters are rude and they can't even add their own prices properly. If I could I would give a lower rating."}
{"text":"Since my parents were down to visit, we decided to stop for dim sum lunch at Central Grand Chinese restaurant.  I have been to this restaurants several times over the years so it is a nice familiar choice.  Atmosphere: 3/5  The restaurant is located on the second floor of a mall, which has several shops including an Asian grocery store and two frozen dim sum stores that we like to shop at.  Parking may be difficult at times but we managed on this weekday noon.  For lunch, only one side of the restaurant was open.  It was nice to still see the traditional carts but it was also possible to order from a menu. The decor is interesting esp with photos of the owners with many Asian celebrities.  Overall comfortable and noise level is ok - still moderately busy despite it being a late lunch on a weekday.  Food: 4/5  We had their signature soup with noodles, sticky rice, shrimp dumpling, and squid.  All the dishes were tasty - for example the sticky rice was actually made of the authentic type of rice and had a lot of toppings which is not found in other dim sum restaurants.  By the time we got ready to order, it was getting late so there was less variety from the carts, but the food was still good.  Price: 3.5/5  Overall reasonable  Service: 2.5/5  Likely below average esp the owners' attitude at times; also I found it strange that if paying by cash, there is no tray for change therefore no chance to tip.  Overall: 3/5  Overall good convenient restaurant with good food; average atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"This place has a small parking lot which is hard to get parking. You also have to pay. The food is often not that fresh on the carts and it's a bit more expensive than other places I have been to. However the service was good."}
{"text":"Alright, Chinese Asian mini mall; consists of a market, stationery store and other miscellaneous shops all bunched into this 2 level building. Just like any typical Cantonese seafood restaurant, Central Grand serves dim sum in the day and changes to an a la carte situation in the evening for dinner. Located on the upper level of this mall, just like the building itself - the space needs a total facelift. Looking beyond the dreaded and dated exterior and the equally eyesoring mess  of the interior, food was also a letdown. Overly salty, and greasy so sum it up, says something when I don't come out of a meal with even one picture. The one positive is that they do have a few more unique dim sum items that I typically don't see anywhere else. (More squid and duck feet options if you're into that) Service was mediocre, constantly had to wave someone down to get a refill for our tea and water. They were quick to take away empty plates and the carts were coming consistently in a timely manner as well. All the dishes that were also coming out were hot and fresh too. Prices here compared to our usual dim sum spot is slightly cheaper but with the food barely meeting expectations, I'd say it isn't worth it. Pass."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the service completely, our friend' nose was blooded suddenly, and we required more tissues, and a short hair lady said I already gave yours some, why you asked more, and her attitude was very bad and rude. The food is not the best in Calgary, but the service I can say it is the top1 worst."}
{"text":"Can not believe that this was my first visit EVER to the Chinese Mall on 16th Avenue.  Always meant to - but never did.  Terry Lo hosted a Chinese New Year dinner there last Sunday.  When we arrived, we found the restaurant on the 2nd floor of the mall and as we approached I was surprised how full it was.  We were in a room on one side that had 6 tables - with 8 people at a table - room could easily accomodate 50 people.  Nice for a group event.  Tables were all round with a lazy susan in the middle - eliminating the need to pass around dishes, we could just spin the wheel as needed.  Handy!  Terry had arranged for a 10-course menu.  The food was incredible.  I will just mention my favorite dishes...  - Veggies with Shrimp:  I'm not usually a veggie person, so this surprised me.  The veggies had a silkiness to them - can't describe it differently that that.  So good.  - Shrimp Balls rolled in Almonds:  These rounds were the size of small fists and incredibly hot - so I kept dropping it and spashing almonds all over. But it was so worth it.  Can't wait to enjoy these again.  - BBQ Chicken:  I love chicken and I LOVE eating the skin.  Not sure how this was prepared, but it was so tastely and I'm sure it must have been deep-fried.  The skin on the chicken was crunchy...  for me it could not have been prepared more perfectly.  I will enjoy one whole order myself next time (ok - will probably have left overs to take home!)  - I'm a dessert person and I was waiting to see what fancy treat would be laid before us.  Will admit that my heart sank a bit when I realized dessert was Naval Oranges cut into slices.  Wow - it turned out to be perfect.  As I for sure enjoyed to much of the NINE other dishes, these oranges were the perfect way to cap the meal.  So juicy - they did NOT buy those at Safeway. :)  Loved it - can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is a new discovery for me.  I've eaten here 3 times in about 6 weeks.  It's so good!   Although I don't want people to know because it is always lined up.   But it's so large that you can be seated relatively quickly.  Obviously it's very popular.  The food is excellent and the price is very reasonable.  The free parking at the back of the building is nice."}
{"text":"Best egg tarts!"}
{"text":"Consistent food quality for dim sum. My friends and I go here often because it's the best dim sum restaurants closest to the downtown core. The only complaint is if you come at the end of the lunch rush, the carts practically all disappear."}
{"text":"I took my son and his coworkers who all are cooks in Banff for Dim Sum. The food and service was excellent, even though it was very busy. The use of the traditional carts allowed us to choose what looked fresh, and being able to be seated by the kitchen door made things especially good."}
{"text":"We weren't happy with our meal at U and Me, so my sister found this place on Yelp. We had a dim sum lunch here and had all the basics. Didn' t see any dishes that seemed extraordinary. Cool thing is all the pictures on the wall of the owner with famous or notable people. Really busy and hectic. My mom feels that a worker yelled at her when it was time to pay. Why would you come to Calgary, Canada for Chinese food? It's probably not a specialty, but there is a community."}
{"text":"Lucky was I (well ok we) to be invited to a Chinese New Year dinner here.  I'd experienced something similar before but hubs never had...he was going to be out of his element surrounded by 50+ people.  I love the big table concept with a lazy susan in the middle (note to self: buy one for home).  The menu was extensive and exciting.  Peking Duck w/ Crepes, Deep Fried Seafood (prawn) Roll, Stir Fried Prawns w. Honey Walnuts, Fish and Shredded Duck Soup, Braised Crab & Lobster, Braised Chinese Mushroom with Veggies, Crispy Skin Garlic Chicken, Deep Fried Lin Cod in Soya, Duck and Pineapple Fried Rice, Red Bean Soup Dessert.  I'm not a huge mushroom fan (even though I eat them) and must admit the unusual (to me) earthy mushroom in the veggie dish was not my favourite...but I loved the broccolini that accompanied the dish.  Everything was so delicious.  Out of the corner of my eye I watched hubs going back for seconds on almost every dish.....in fact almost everyone at our table went back for seconds.  There was a ton of it so enough for the team!   The red bean soup is something I've never tried before.  It reminded me of a sweet black bean soup and while I didn't mind it I was done after a couple spoonfuls.  Hubs on the other hand finished the entire bowl.    This restaurant is a best kept secret.  Tucked into a mall on the corner of 16th & Centre street you wouldn't know it was there if you weren't looking or been told.  You can find parking easily behind the building.   There are also other stores to browse through in the Mall associated with the restaurant.  Definitely worth an outing."}
{"text":"Doesn't get any more authentic than this. It's located on the 2nd floor of an all Chinese little shopping center. this is not a typical North American Chinese restaurant where everything cooked to the taste of white men! This is where the Chinese families go and eat.  Open up your mind, be ready to try new things, and take a trip to China in the heart of Calgary!  Tip:  If you go there, be sure to have a Chinese speaking person with you, or you will be totally lost with the Chinese menu and might end up eating something you didn't plan on eating!"}
{"text":"Not really sure why the reviews are so high...maybe because there are not many places like Central Grand in the area? Yes, it is cool that they do the traditional dim sum carts. But...we need to take into account the flavour and the freshness of the dim sum as well. Most of the dim sum we ordered was cold. The flavour was so-so. We ordered from the menu, a dish of yang chow fried rice. Honestly, it was over priced (same as the dim sum) and not very flavourful. The cleanliness of the plates and chopsticks were questionable too. No table cloths were used either. My boyfriend and I, both Chinese, were expecting it to be really good because of the long line up and Yelp reviews but were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Service: 3/5 Food Quality: 5/5 Dining Area: 4/5 Convenience: 4/5 Parking: 4/5 Value: 4/5  The food quality for both dim sum and evening dinner is excellent here.  The dining area is way too small to accomodate everyone that comes so you'll need a number but it will be worth it once you get seated.  Also, the service staff is aloof but gets the job done."}
{"text":"Central Grand... I'm looking at the address and wondering why I haven't seen the sign for it before? I drive up... where IS this place? I park behind the Chinese mall on 16th Ave. I figure it's got to be around there somewhere. And it is! It's up the stairs and towards the end of the hall.  It's one of those restaurants I wouldn't know what to order unless someone who knows Chinese food is with me. We all gathered for a special pre-Chinese New Year dinner. Thank goodness it was a set menu.  I'm a rural-Alberta kid. The kind of Chinese food we grew up on was chicken balls, ginger beef and chicken fried rice. In fact, most every dish came with rice. Central Grand isn't this kind of place. It's the kind where when you order a fish dish, it shows up still looking like a fish... and there's no rice with.  It's got the big round tables with the lazy susan in the middle so you can keep that food spinning round and round to each of the parties at your table. If you want your own room because you've got 50 people to feed, you'll find that here too. We were all seated in a room just off to the right from the main dining hall.  I wish I could help you out in terms of specific dishes to order, unfortunately my knowledge stops here. But, except for the big mushroom things that I wasn't a fan of, I liked each of the dishes they brought us. The breaded chicken breast was quite tasty, and there was some version of a rice wrap that was certainly a popular dish at the table.   If someone offers you the red bean soup thing as a dessert... well, it's different! Sweet. I ate about half of it before I had had enough."}
{"text":"This place is packed when you go there on the weekend, but is definitely well worth the wait. I like their dim sum here too, especially this fried squid . It was so crunchy and all yummy goodness. I definitely recommend this place for others in yelp that live in Calgary."}
{"text":"Okay, I might be giving a biased review since my uncle works as the head chef here..  You might have had his dim sum...  But anyways, the sizes and portions of the dim sum are pretty big compared to what we have in NYC and there's more varieties too. Some of the dim sum I haven't even seen in NYC yum cha before...  The dessert here isn't bad either, the mango pudding, the coconut pudding, and so much more. I also had a traditional dinner here as well. The scallops are delish!  But I think you can take the word for it since tons of Hong Kong celebrities have dined here.."}
{"text":"Great Food but with awful services especially the owner of the restaurant. He is only with manner when you are not Chinese or VIP guests. Today I went there to meet my uncle for lunch and when I inquire where is the seat for my uncle's reservation. He very rude to tell me they don't have the reservation for him. So, I have to call my uncle to see where he sit. During the lunch, he was come by and at that moment his changed his attitude to a person with good manner. If not because of my uncle I will definitely no choose this restaurant for dining out."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for Dim Sum within walking distance and we weren't disappointed with this restaurant.  We arrived first thing when they opened on a Saturday and there were only a few other people waiting to be seated.  They seated us and served our drinks (we had tea) then 10 minutes after opening they started bringing around the carts.  There wasn't a huge selection of food compared to the Dim Sum at King Fisher, downtown, but the food they served was of good quality.  They didn't have any $3.50-4.00 items so it was a little higher than some places.  It was very well staffed considering the quantity of customers during the early morning were quite small.  We were able to eat, chat, enjoy our tea and head out in good time.  If you're within the vicinity and are looking for some good Dim Sum I highly recommend this place.  I don't eat Dim Sum frequently but the next time I do it's likely it will be at this place again.  Note that the private lot only has room for about 10 cars but the restaurant seats about 100."}
{"text":"Here is a convenient place to go for dim-sum. Located on the top floor of the building on the corner of 16th Ave and Centre St N, you can find this fancier Chinese restaurant.   Being frank, their food is simply on par with a lot of restaurants in Chinatown. There aren't a lot of things that really stand out to set then above the rest. But I do have to say that the tofu desert with ginger syrup is absolutely delicious. One of my favourite dishes here.   For the price of the food, it can be hard to justify a visit when there are less expensive options elsewhere. Don't mistake me here that the food tastes great because it does. But I'm not always willing to shell out for the same elsewhere at a slightly better deal."}
{"text":"OK, we were here on Sunday, so everything a little slow to come. I would think there are a few health violations. Overall food was good but slow and surly."}
{"text":"Great place for Dim Sum!  I liked the selection that they had on different dim sum carts.  Good service too.  Servers made sure that the table was never full of empty plates or steamer trays.  We never ran out of tea.  The only wish that I have is for them to have a better dessert selection.  I think there were only 4 or 5 kinds... none that screamed EAT ME!!!  However, having said that, I did enjoy the tofu dessert.  The environment was good too.  We were able to follow our conversations despite the noise level."}
{"text":"I have been to central grand twice. It's close to my brothers house, so it's convenient when we are in Calgary for the weekend. The parking can be a little tough because the Chinese mall that this place is in gets busy, but once you get upstairs it's worth the hassle. The dining room is huge, so we've never waited more than a few minutes for a table. As is typical with dim sum that is cart based, the second you sit down you can start eating (love that!) The highlights for me are the salt and pepper squid which is amazing. It's totally different than the same dish which is just the tentacles... We got both and they were both good, but I prefer the softer slices as opposed to the chewy tentacle ends. We hit all the standard items like rice in a lotus leaf, su Mai, pork buns, dumplings and they were all good. I have to comment on the tripe. I used to think my brother ordered it just to see if I would eat it... I always thought it was just ok, but here it was great! I was surprised by how much I liked it, very juicy tender and flavourful.  The other surprisingly good item was the cuttle fish. It's like a weird shaped squid (big head tiny legs). It was really really good. It's a little expensive for dim sum at about $25 per person, but everything was good, fresh and timely, so you can't complain at that."}
