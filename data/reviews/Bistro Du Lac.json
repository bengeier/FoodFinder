{"text":"Next to a lake Margueritte (sp?). Beautiful place to stroll. We stopped by after strolling the lake. I wanted macarons and mango mousse  There were no greeters.  I stuck my head into the lounge, and asked where the bakery was. They pointed me in the correct direction.  Bakery was empty Sunday 3:15 PM.  After wandering around a bit, looking for someone to help us, We found someone and asked him if they had the mango mousse cake. He told us to call ahead in the mornings and the baker will make it fresh for us.  I ordered a few macarons to go. They were tiny and 2.75 each. I liked the vanilla macaron the best, but personally I like the Yellow Leaf Cupcake Co's macarons better. (In Seattle, WA) but this isn't Seattle.  The person that checked us out kind of struggled with the system. He explained how its a new business and they're not fully staffed, and it seemed like the restaurant software wasn't the most user-friendly.  Jake (?) the chef spoke French fluently and was very kind to us. He gave us a business card and told us exactly how the bakery works, and recommended the almond croissant, chocolate and coffee eclairs when they're fresh.  I don't think I'll dine in but I may stop by the bakery again after calling.  I go stroll the lake for the scenery.  I'd rather pack my meals from home and have a picnic by the lakeside and get deserts to go, but thats just me, a savvy student on a budget.  After getting those macarons, I won't be getting my mani/ pedi this month. (opportunity cost)"}
{"text":"The one star is only because the patio outside is delightful.  Took a friend for a birthday lunch on a recent Saturday.  We ordered a vegetable quiche and the chicken in a sauce.  The incorrect quiche was delivered.   The server, who only worked there for two days, thought we were incorrect.  Another server corrected her and the correct one was brought out.  My chicken was served with two pieces.  One piece was tough and over done and the other piece was under cooked.  I ordered a different entree that was less expensive but they neglected to change the bill.  The coffee I ordered was cool.  To make things worse an employee stopped by the table and asked what the problem was.  I explained to him the problems we encountered and then he just walked away.  No apology, no discussion.  He just walked away."}
{"text":"Just popped in for happy hour. I had the hummus and grilled vegetables, fabulous. Husband had quiche and house salad, also great. Please support local! The owner came out to meet us. They have a new mixologist at the bar and a new menu."}
{"text":"I love French food and this restaurant did not disappoint. I had poulet with haricot Bert and some amazing pomme frites with blue cheese. It was lovey. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"For lunch, our table ordered quiche and sandwiches.  The quiche was okay, a bit under seasoned but average and served with a side salad that was beyond tiny, three bites of lettuce.   Sandwiches, Lots of bread, No butter, no dressing of any kind, thin slice of ham and a thin slice of cheese, a few leaves of lettuce...very dry.  Tuna sandwich:  dry tuna on dry bread, my fellow diner asked for mustard just so the bread would stick to the tuna.  My sandwich side was pomme frites, about ten small strips of pale blond fried (?) potatoes, needed to cook longer so the color would be more appetizing. Service was slow, no refills on ice tea, even though it's $3 a class.  I could see the service improving if they are open longer, but am at a loss to explain the food. Tried the bakery, decided on a selection of macaroons, my favorite.  they were on the small size, sold for $2.75 each, they were gummy and very disappointing."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place as we were driving home and saw the sign.  We love bakeries so we thought we would give it a try.  Omg are we glad we did!  Bistro is also a full restaurant so when we walked in, there were two hostesses who were super friendly and I asked if the bakery was still open.  They said it was and walked us back to the bakery which is in the far back corner of the restaurant.  It is not staffed by a person unless you are buying something.  The owner/manager (really nice lady who is definitely from France, loved her accent!) followed us back to help ring us up.  The selection is not huge but more than enough.  They had eclairs, croissants, and several chocolate and fruit tarts.  You have to get the almond croissants!!!  They are to die for!!!  We also got some eclairs (vanilla and chocolate) and they are super good too.  We will be back to try dinner for sure because the ambiance on the patio by the lake looked amazing!!"}
{"text":"So excited to see a new restaurant open in this beautiful location on Marguerite Lake.  Unfortunately our experience was a huge disappointment.  Our family of 6 went for a special birthday lunch. After ordering we waited hours for our lunch to appear. As it finally appeared, I was told that they had run out of quiche lorraine, so would have to order something else.  Gong show!  We sent back an order of mussels as they were awful. Fruit salad was not fresh.  Green salad was what you'd get from any salad bag and was under dressed.  Nothing special about Caesar salad, which was also under dressed.  My husband did like the French onion soup and crepes, but other than that our meal was a complete disaster.  We left hungry and not at all impressed with  the new establishment.  I wish them well, but will not be returning.  They need to get their act together (food quality, staffing, communication) if they expect to be successful."}
{"text":"My friend and I chose lunch at Bistro du Lac today because it was (a) new and (b) halfway between our homes.   Each of us is going through a lot of personal \"stuff\" right now.  Translation: neither of us was in a good mood when we sat down.   But we left happy!  We had lovely meals served by a delightful (albeit slightly disorganized) serving staff.    My friend loved her mushroom soup as well as the Salade Nicoise.   I ordered the vegetarian crepe and was impressed by the melt-in-your mouth crepe and the yummy filling (full disclosure: I'm a sucker for melted Gruyere!).    We both agreed that while we still have our problems, a great lunch with a wonderful friend made our lives better!  We shall return.    PS:  I should add the Bistro du Lac is VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY.  Lots of yummy choices."}
{"text":"Beautiful view and that is about all.  I met a few friends there for happy hour on the patio which was entirely a disaster. During the 2 hours there, we never received food that was ordered, water glasses remained empty almost the entire time, and our bill was wrong. The server explained they get slammed for happy hour,  but don't staff appropriately so I felt bad for her as I could see she was very busy. The experience at happy hour does not entice me to ever be back for a full meal. Also, it is definitely only going to attract a \"mature\" crowd, I was really hoping for another spot like The Vig nearby."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but I absolutely had to for this.  I was excited to go here for Easter brunch because I love French food and the views looked spectacular. I guess I should have seen the empty restaurant and turned around, but we decided to go ahead and go for it.  We were seated and given the buffet menu which was interesting to say the least. I got a very bitter mimosa and got up to check out the buffet. It was paltry pickings for $40, Ham & Lamb are staples of easter brunch, but everything else was missing. It looked like Costco actually set up the buffet table, no usual brunch items could be found.  The ice cream was actually in a plastic container that it came from at the store, the potatoes were not the best, and other than that it was vegetables and fruit that came from a party platter. I picked a few things and tried to finish as fast as possible. We definitely didn't want to be there for any more than one plate.  The best part is we got the bill with an automatic 20% gratuity added for a buffet! I saw the waitress all of twice. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Bistro du Lac seemed to have everything I was looking for in a nice restaurant for Valentine's Day so I gave it a shot and was not disappointed. I thought the service was excellent and dinner was fantastic. The staff I encountered were all very friendly, and the owner himself came by to make sure we were having a wonderful dining experience.   The restaurant is convenient to get to and park, and there's a charming path by the lake where you can take a romantic stroll after the meal. I highly recommend Bistro du Lac, and I will be stopping by again in the future."}
{"text":"Overall nice experience. Started with the French Onion Soup and Beet salad at our table. Quality and portion were good.  For the main course had the scallops and cod. I thought the scallops dish was exceptional. The cod was tasty and nicely presented. Didn't try dessert this round."}
{"text":"We had a lovely lunch here today at a great table overlooking the lake. The service was spot-on and the food was solid. The salmon quiche was light and fluffy and had a beautiful, buttery crust. My husband's smoked salmon crepe was loaded with salmon and very satisfying while our daughter thoroughly enjoyed her croque Monsieur. We didn't have room for dessert but the tray looked luscious and we were assured all was made in-house. Will definitely make a return visit."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try the new restaurant that went into Busters old location. But that's were are excitement ended. We spent over 2 hours trying to get brunch and they simply are not ready to be open. It took over 30 minutes to get cold coffee. When we ordered we were told they were unable to make crepes. There went 30 percent of the menu.  2 of the 4 of us changed our orders only to find out 45 minutes later they were now out of quiche. At least they served 2 of the people at our table. When my third request for food arrived my ham, mushroom and cheese omelette was under seasoned.  It also was missing the ham and cheese. We just had to laugh.  There are too many good restaurants to waste your time on this one. And if you want to try to open before you are ready at least buy enough food for your signature dishes."}
{"text":"Can you give a restaurant no stars, because I can't even give them 1.  Restaurant week and I was so excited when I looked at the menu for this event.  The escargot was like eating rubber snails, they came in ramekins with gravy poured over them that tasted like a fake package made gravy and were served cold! Yuk! What happened to the garlic butter?  When we complained the waiter took them away and a few minutes later brought the same dishes half eaten and passed them around the table, each one of us got the other ones half eaten dish and we were shuffling them around the table to get the ones we originally started with.  So what they did was take our dishes that we ate into, put them into something to heat them up and brought the same dishes back which made the snails even more rubbery.  Now comes the main course, we ordered the scallops, there were only 2 the size of a quarter on top of a very nasty burnt eggplant concoction also on the plate was risotto and lobster sauce except it appeared to be white rice put into a cup and turned upside down on the plate with the same fake package made gravy poured over top.  For $44 per person, I don't think so; I will never go back there."}
{"text":"what a miss! We were so looking forward to something with an authentic French flare. This place has tacky decor, slow service and very mediocre food. Come on Scottsdale... let's attract better talent in the restaurant mix. LA gets Terrine and we get Bistro Du Lack. Lacking taste in decor and food. Bummer.  Only bright spot was i decided to try the chocolate croissant. It was very good but I can get an equally good one from Trader Joes, bake it and have gooey chocolate vs. cold chocolate inside."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever experienced anything so disappointing. My escargot were chewy and tasteless, the duck confit was dry and also chewy ( clearly fro the day before ) the place only had 6 other people so that's the only explanation. The waitress asked how it was and I told her. My friend had ceaser  salad which was ok and the coquille St. Jacques( didn't look like any I have had before. It was 5 small scallops on a  bed of something that was supposed to be risotto. They made no accommodation for previous day's dry duck.  The locale is very large and very empty.  I should have read other reviews prior to going there. Definitely on the do not return list."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food. Scrambled eggs without any type of bread. Subpar quiche. Overdressed salad. Very confused staff."}
{"text":"Sad to say, not a great experience.  We were looking forward to trying out Bistro as is in the neighborhood.   Buster's, the previous tenants,  had been a favorite location.    Unforturnately, when I arrived, ahead of an associate, for lunch on a weekday, there were no greeters. The decor was okay.  The staff didn't look \"fresh\" and eager to please.  The owner (I presumed) was arguing in French with another worker.  Upon being seated, no explanation of the menu or beverage options.   I ordered the day's special, a Lorraine Mushroom Crepe which arrived sans garnishment.  Mushroom soup was average and a bit too salty.  My associate, had one of the \"artisan\" sandwiches which arrived appearing like half a sub from subway, sans garnishment.  Plop.....sandwich only.  For the price of $13 a serviing, defintely the price point did not equal the value or taste.  Dinner may be a different experience?  That said, they really need to spray the overhang on the patio for bugs and wash the chairs outdoors. I don't even want to know what was on the sides of the chairs and thank goodness didn't see them until we were leaving.  eeek  Rated two stars as the food was edible and the view of the lake pleasant.  They really need to step it up to remain in business.  There are so many other great options in the same area.   Enough said."}
{"text":"I went top Bistro Du Lac this past Saturday night. I made a reservation for 4 at 6pm through OpenTable (which is super easy to use). It was not busy at all and we were greeted with a friendly smile and immediately shown our table. The whole restaurant is nicely decorated and has a very welcoming ambiance. Brandi, our server, was great with us. We even got a sample tasting of one of their appetizers free of charge. Everyone at our table left with happy and full stomachs. No complaints from anyone and we tried their coffee creme brulee dessert which was just delish. We ended up leaving after paying the bill about 7:30. Simply a wonderful time and now my mom wants to go back for their lunch. I hope this place stays around for a while. Their bar area looks very inviting for an after work glass of wine and cheese plate with a friend - not to mention the great view by the lake! We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Living in the neighborhood, I looked forward to the opening of this restaurant.  Our party was so excited to try this new addition to the McCormick Ranch restaurant scene. Unfortunately, it seems that Bistro du Lac is far from ready for customers.  Everything from service to food preparation is in dire need of improvement.  First, upon arrival, we were asked if we had reservations despite the fact that the restaurant was less than half capacity.  We said no and had to ask if we could sit in a near empty bar.  Along with several other patrons, we were eventually seated in the bar area and told that we could order from the full menu.    The service was without a doubt the worst I have ever experienced in any restaurant.  Our server, while friendly, had only been on the job for two days and knew absolutely nothing about the restaurant's menu or dish preparation. Many items from the menu were apparently not available. Meals arrived at different times and were not as ordered.  I might have chalked this up to a one-off issue with our party but the table next to us experienced the exact same problems. Staff from the restaurant kept apologizing profusely because the service and kitchen performance have apparently been a problem since opening.    Bottom line, meals at this restaurant are above average in cost related to nearby offerings.  One expects more for the prices paid at this restaurant. It is clear that this restaurant is not ready for prime time and there appears to be low awareness from managers of the problems. Open more than a month, these issues should have been addressed by now.  There are much better nearby options to consider. I would stay away until the kinks are worked out - if that's possible."}
{"text":"I went here on Valentines Day. I read reviews on how it was a new restaurant and that they were still working out their kinks. I figured why not give it a chance? Well the food was delicious. The service was not the best. The valet and hostesses (there were 3?) were more welcoming than our waitress. It was not busy and it seemed like some of the staff wished they were elsewhere. My boyfriend and I were treated very differently than the couple behind us. I also feel like you should be given correct silverware (I had to find someone for a spoon to eat my soup). It was rather silly especially since it was not packed at all. I am willing to give this place another chance only because my bf's family insisted they would get us better service next time. However, for now I would rather go to Zinc Bistro for French food."}
{"text":"Give this place a chance. They're still fairly new but the food is superb.   My work colleagues and I came here for dinner after work. I'm a bit of a francophile, having studied French and visited France. We were greeted by one of the owners and seated by the patio overlooking Lake Marguerite.  After munching on the bread baskets, we perused the menu for appetizers. We ordered the Escargots de Bourgogne and the Pate Aux Deux Facons (pate in two ways) for appetizers. The food came straight away. The pate was rich and flavorful and the escargots were good.  For entrées, I ordered the Canard a L'orange (Orange glazed duck). My colleagues ordered the Boeuf Bourguignon and the Loup de Mer (seabass).   We sampled a bit of each other's dishes. My duck was delicious (I'm a huge fan of duck) and the orange glaze complimented it perfectly. The mashed potatoes went great with the orange sauce. The seabass was delicious and you could taste the flavors of the white wine and butter. It reminded me of the seabass I had in Paris one spring. The beef Bourguignon was hearty and tender.   The service was attentive and the owner was very friendly. Don't be afraid to practice your French with her! The view from the patio was beautiful, especially at dusk (see pics).  I'll definitely come back for brunch."}
{"text":"A disappointment. On the expensive side for mediocre food.  Mussels in white wine sauce ok, but I had to ask for bread for mopping up the sauce, and it wasn't even good crusty French bread.  Accompanying French fries might have been frozen.  Confit of duck was a single duck leg and small risotto cake, not attractively presented."}
{"text":"I'm a stickler in writing nothing negative. So- all I can say is this place is a great experience. The owners are amazingly pleasant, hard working and want the guest experience to be amazing!!! I hope those who had negative things to say go back and get the good experience they missed out on when they first opened."}
{"text":"I will give this place another shot later on in an attempt to give a positive review particularly because I live in the neighborhood and we need more options.  Went in on day 3. Requested seating outside and was told there was none available. Then was told we could sit on the portico, outside. Walked through the large bar area to an empty portico which I guess just means we aren't in the usual restaurant area and why they said nothing was available outside. Well, once we sat down we got almost no service. It was like we were in a closed restaurant.  Very entertaining was the kind french server who did not know what cream and sugar is after we ordered our coffee. One quiche and lobster eggs came 40 minutes later.   It was good but I question the cost.  Try at your own risk. These guys can hopefully turn into an amazing place asap to provide a fantastic authentic experience. Otherwise they won't make it."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out this new restaurant in my neighborhood. We went for Happy Hour because they advertise a wine bar and Buster's used to have a great Happy Hour.. We were disappointed on the choices we had for beer and only 2 choices of cheap wine ( wine bar :-( ) for 5.00 a glass. We ordered sliders which were served charred and a meat and cheese tray that had more lettuce than meat and cheese. We decided to continue our happy hour at another establishment. The owners of this place should really compare their happy hour offering with their competition. Crust, Tavern Grille, Fletcher's, Roaring Fork , twisted rose and blind pig. When the prices are competitive, the quality must also stand up."}
{"text":"I am French and was really excited to discover a new place in Scottsdale.  Quelle déception !!!! We arrived around 6:30pm and had to wait almost 5 minutes for the someone to greet us and sit us at a table. Our waiter came and tried to recommend all his favorite stuff on the menu. I don't care what is his favorite stuff. I can read the menu and if I have any question then I will let you know. I ordered a Kir Royal and my wife ordered a coke with a slice of lemon. Few minutes later the waiter comes back with the coke without lemon. I then asked when my Kir Royal will arrive and was told they were out of sparkling wine... We placed order for salmon, scallops and \"moules frites marinières\". Even if it's written in French on the menu, the waiter did not understand when I said \"moules frites\".  We had to wait almost 45 minutes for our food to arrive !!! Mussels were good size and good quality but they were almost dry, like overcooked or reheated. Salmon and scallops were very basically prepared. Not what you would expect from any French restaurant.  We thought we will give a try to the desserts since they are advertising their bakery and pastries. The waiter came back with 3 fruit tartelettes and a couple of puff pastries with cream not looking better than the one you could find in a Flunch restaurant. We preferred not taking any dessert. In the end we paid over $100 for a below average meal. Way too much."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. I had been to this place about a week beforehand and met a friend for happy hour. That was a pleasant experience so I decided to return for dinner to get the full experience and enable me to write a useful review. My friend and I met there on Monday of Restaurant Week. I arrived early so I sat at the bar and chatted with Rianne (sp). She was very friendly and pleasant. I asked for bleu cheese stuffed olives for my drink but she indicated that only pimento ones were available. After a few minutes she said that she would stuff some for me if I would like. I've met very few bartenders willing to do that. She gets 5 stars for that! My friend arrived and we decided to dine on the patio overlooking the lake. Very romantic and peaceful. We were told that only the Restaurant Week menu was available, but neither of thought was an issue. She ordered the escargots  and I ordered the pate for our appetizers. That's when the disappointment began. The escargot were served sans shells but they were ok, lacking in presentation. The pate was a tremendous disappointment. It was served in a very small ramekin coated by a thick layer of duck fat. Both my friend (she's European) and I are used to pate served in slices. We both ordered sea bass in puff pastry with saffron sauce as our entrees. The pastry was very pale and the sauce and fish were absolutely tasteless. The entree was served with approximately a quarter cup of extremely unappetizing (in appearance and taste) ratattouille. The desserts were equally uninspired. My friend complained about the quality of our dinners and we were told that ours was the only complaint that had been made. The manager did make an adjustment to the bill. I came to Bistro with high hopes for this fairly new restaurant but I left greatly disappointed. After reviewing the prior reviews I'm afraid my experience was not the exception. The friendly, accommodating bartender, the nice patio, the charcuterie are the only positives I can find. I honestly hope the operators of Bistro can make it work."}
{"text":"I have been twice, not wanting to review a new restaurant just after opening. Gave them 6 weeks in between to work on service issues. Unfortunately it seems that the service actually has worsened.  Before I continue on that note, I want to point out that it is a shame, as the food quality on the second visit was actually better than average (Croque Madame and Turkey Club).  We arrived last Saturday at 11am for a light brunch. The hostess was pleasant and seated us on the patio. However with no menus (really one of the two tasks a hostess has).  I had a bad feeling so checked the time. 6 minutes went by and my companion stopped a server to ask for menus. (The patio has only 9 tables and all but one were full. 2 servers and a busser walked by us several times in that time frame).  Menus arrived from a server. One was stained and the other torn, rescued by a strip of masking tape.   Said server came back 4 minutes later to take a drink order - which could have been done while dropping of menus, I would think. As soon as the server left a second server came by to take a drink order. We replied that had been taken care of and we were ready to order.   The food arrived in a good amount of time. 12 minutes.  One good sign, The young lady running the food was not a server and may have been the Kitchen manager? She was the only person on staff that seemed somewhat competent.   As mentioned above, food quality was better than average.  My iced tea was never refilled during the meal, and the glass is only 10 ounces, so not a huge serving to begin with. I also find it odd that there is only one free refill for coffee - not  specialty coffees, but drip coffee. No restaurant in the world charges for drip coffee refills that I am aware of.  My companion finished. I ate half the sandwich and asked the busser for a box. She indicated she would be right back. Never saw her again at all, on the patio or elsewhere.  We had to search for someone to bring a box and also a check. We never returned to the table, as there was just no reason to be ignored out there.  A few other notes:  A large majority of the customers were on the patio. It is not as if there were 20 table in the dining room filled. Maybe 4.   The owner came out to the patio to greet some guests that he knew. Doing so he stood in the way of the service corridor; the staff literally had to go out of their way to work around him. Serving is tough enough without the owner creating more obstacles.  Finally, the restaurant in its title has \"Wine Bar\".  Sort of a stretch, as on the menu there are only 7 whites, 4 of which are French. Poor attempt.   I am loathe to sound so critical. However in my career I have 20 years experience as an HR consultant for hotels and restaurants. It is obvious to me that the wrong people were hired (minus the one) and that they have received no training. Thus, there really is no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had lunch today..granted this is a NEW restaurant and they need to get the kinks out:  My Caesar was bland(too much mayo)...hubby's chicken salad was boring(some green with some grape tomatoes and 1/2 chicken breast...good vinagrette)...I did tell the server about my caesar(she agreed after tasting the caesar dressing in the back)...I had a cup of mushroom soup...and guess what they still charged me for the caesar salad...I NEVER saw or spoke to a manager.  Decor was lovely  Would we go back...NO WAY"}
{"text":"This place was great.  The music was perfect.  Great jazz.  Delphine Cortez and Joel Robin really made it a wonderful night for me and my family   The food was really good   From appetizer to entree. The escargots they came well seasoned and sizzling to our table and they were consumed by all with smiles.  The entrees we had were the sea bass which was seasoned and cooked to perfection - the skin was crisp yet moist and eaten by those who normally don't eat the skin,  the bouillabaisse  had many of the gems of the sea in a sauce that was well refined and from a well balanced reduction and the scallops which were perfectly cooked over creamy risotto with spinach on the side that was just right.  Their wine list was good recommend the Fortant"}
