{"text":"obviously, most reviewers here have never had really authentic japanese cuisine. i have had japanese in san francisco, new york city, and philadelphia. they were wonderful experiences. this, unfortunately, is just very mediocre cuisine. in particular, the sushi tasted very day old and as mentioned in another website, they probably bought it at giant eagle!
the teriyaki was extremely sugar/salty tasting and was at least a 1/2 inch thick on top of the small serving of chicken. also, the salad came in the smallest bowl i have ever seen in a japanese restaurant and was local iceberg no less! plus the white rice was not the best i have had either - rather too soft and a bit on the chill side.
the two 1/2 inch side of carrots and the ONE 1/2 inch side of broccoli were both overcooked. i mean, why even both with those lame portions! and to top it all off, when we left the restaurant, the host kept playing on his computer and didn't even acknowledge us, even though we just spent over $ 20 a piece! so all in all, for suburban mindsets inexperienced with real authentic asian cuisine, i suppose they will think this is great japanese. it isn't. it is a ripoff in price, and on top of that, not a very friendly place either. why bother?!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but lackluster performance. Chef was friendly and engaging tho. Must try!"}
{"text":"Went here after work and sat at the Sushi bar.  Overall a good experience.  Server and sushi-ya were both attentive and pleasant.  Service was very fast, although I should note we were the only people in the bar area.  Sushi was delicious and well presented (We tried six different kinds.)  No complaints and I would go there again."}
{"text":"I've had several varieties of sushi and so far they have all been good.  I've eaten at the bar and I've had take-out.  The service was relaxed and almost slow when I ate in, but the take-out is pretty quick.  So far I've been satisfied with fresh taste and appetizing presentations each time.  Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable.  The restaurant has take-out, a bar with a TV and a room with several hibachi setups."}
{"text":"EDIT:

To the intelligent reviewer who posted above my review, who was referencing my review, I actually met the old owners many times of Asuka, and KNOW for a fact that it is NOT the same owners at Arashi, and is not the same quality food, nor staff.  I also know some new workers at the new restaurant Arashi, who weren't working at the previous restaurant, Asuki.  

The food at the new restaurant Arashi is not great, and is overpriced.  And as for the reviewer's comment above mine, I do not like suhi, so your statement saying that we all like sushi, is bluntly false.  In the future, don't put false information for fake reviews.  Have a nice day.


Totally unimpressed.  Asuka was there before, and that was an amazing restaurant.  It's cool because I've been to both, but unfortunately, asuka closed down, and arashi opened.  Well, the food was mediocre, portions were noticeably smaller, and prices were higher than asuka.  I won't be coming here for quite sometime, unless I get dragged there.  And even if I get dragged, I'll put up a good argument!

I really had high hopes for this restaurant."}
{"text":"In my years of living in and visiting many major cities, I've had some of the best sushi and some of the worst, and Arashi's sushi is above average overall and in the top 3 amongst my Cleveland experiences. I almost regret saying this, because I want him all to myself, but I LOVE the bartender here when I come in on Sunday afternoons. He makes the best cucumber cocktails, and he's funny and interesting to talk to, while letting me and my crowd to be the center of attention. Sitting at his bar on a lazy Sunday is my idea of a perfect day. If you say Arashi, I say let's go!!! Also, I say the price range is a splurge, but that's because our crowd eats sushi like it's our last day on earth. If you don't order six things off the menu as well as several drinks, it probably wont break the bank."}
{"text":"Way to over price for the quality & quantity of the sushi! Only reason why we come here is bc of the convenience. Spicy tuna how can you get that wrong, smh! Service sucks to. Maybe. We should try their habachi, maybe that would be worth going back."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for dinner and sat with another family. Our server was prompt in taking drink orders and delivering them. After about 5 minutes she came back to take our food order and turn on the grill. Soup and salad were delivered and then she vanished. Our hibachi chef was delightful and put on a great show for us. We were definitely pleased. Everything was prepared just how we had ordered and was delicious!

When we were done eating we wanted boxes to take leftovers home in and our check. No waitress. No waitress. No waitress. We could see people waiting in the lobby so we were anxious to relieve our table to them. Almost 10 minutes later we got boxes for our food, but no check. Gone again. She finally came back with plastic bags to put our food boxes in - and the check. We didn't even look at the amount and just gave her a credit card. My only complaint was the time at the end of the meal when we were trying to leave."}
{"text":"Delicious! We have been looking for years for a good Japanese and sushi restaurant and we finally found it. Everything, from our edame appetizer to the salad w/fresh ginger dressing to the light miso soup and fresh entrees, was wonderful. I ordered the Arashi (sp) box in order to sample a variety of items. The Tempora shrimp was light and thankfully it didn't taste like fryer oil (so often dirty oil ruins the tempura). The shrimp dumplings were equally flavorful. The best was the teriyaki salmon - the sauce was smooth, not too sweet, and the fish was cooked perfectly. Every bite was awesome. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by these positive reviews. This place is disgusting. We went for lunch and got a variety of items. 2 types of sushi, soba noodles, and a salad. Not one dish was good and I'm pretty easy to please. Everything either had a strange off flavor, was too salty or didn't taste fresh. Perhaps their food is better during dinner service but I won't be returning. It's a shame because I live right by there and I thought it could be a quick, local spot for us. But I'd rather go to Vieng's a few blocks down."}
{"text":"I normally don't write a bad review but this one I think I have to. I wish it could be better. To be honest, the ambiance of restaurant is good but I am quite disappointed with the quality of food. I ordered a bento. The fish in the set was ok but the shrimp tempura was like a frozen food. The other menu I ordered was Ramen and sadly it turned out to be an \"instant noodle\" (soup and noodle) with some vegetable and meat, it is not a real ramen that I was expected(I expect sth like home made tasty soup/broth and real noodle). So if you wanna try....Don't order ramen."}
{"text":"I eat sushi weekly and this was just not good, at least the maki. Higher priced and low quality, with clumps of Big Mac sauce. The seaweed salad and miso were excellent though."}
{"text":"I stopped by here when traveling for work looking for some sushi. I would definitely be coming back if it weren't my last night here. I had the maki combo and it was really good. The service was great and the atmosphere was relaxed and extremely pleasant after a long day on the job."}
{"text":"What a great sushi place.  I am so glad I took the recommendation from a friend and tried Arashi.  The sushi chef, Herbert, creates new specials every few days, and they are always fantastic.  The rolls can be a bit pricey, but trust me when I tell you they are worth every penny.

The fried tempura appetizer was outstanding.  If I had to say one negative thing, it would be that the chef put some type of garlic sauce (which we didn't requests) on our white tuna sashimi.  It had a good flavor, but I'm a purist when it comes to sushi, and I would have preferred it without the garlic sauce.  Other than that, the sushi was outstanding.

We sat at the sushi bar, and got a free cucumber salad appetizer, and also a cute orange dessert with plum wine, which was delicious!  I can not say enough good things about this place.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Good for kids or an adult night out.  Sushi and Hibachi are both top notch."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend for date night. Enjoyed the atmosphere a great deal. The cook was entertaining and gave us as much sakki as we wanted :-)
Very good & fresh...def going back!"}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced in the realm of sushi! The cheapest speciality roll is around $14! The sushi isn't bad but it's not that good either. Compared to all the other sushi places offered around Cleveland I would not go back to this place. The pieces were a little too large in my opinion and each bite was a huge mouthful that made it hard to chew your food. The other thing I was not a fan of was they started to clean the floors around us while we were still eating so the smell of bleach was all around us. Thankfully we were close to finishing our meal but this made such a bad impression on us."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. I went here for one of my birthday dinners and I was not disappointed at all. I ordered one of their specialty cocktails and it was way out of my comfort zone, but I liked everything about it. From the presentation down to the taste is was satisfying. I ordered the cali roll (add cream cheese) and spicy tuna roll as an app and they were both really good and came out so fast you would think they were pre made. 

For the main course we did hibachi. I had the filet mignon, lobster and salmon. Of course, it comes with soup, salad, fried rice, shrimp and veg. My date, who hates miso soup loved the onion soup. It was really good and I also enjoyed my house salad. My dinner was prepared to my liking, cooked properly and the chef actually had some tricks we haven't seen yet. 

Portions are huge, service is great and pricing is average. This place is worth a try for all you pessimists. I will be back and I can't wait to try their lunch menu. I was pleasantly surprised with this dining experience."}
{"text":"Surprisingly fresh and tasty sushi! As a native of California, I was not expecting there to be fish this fresh in Ohio. The salmon sashimi was just fantastic. Their specialty sushi rolls were a perfect blend of flavors. We also tried the hamachi kama,  and we absolutely loved the unique seasoning. On top of the amazing food, the service was very prompt and polite. We will definitely be coming back to try their hibachi!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for sushi for dinner recently. Sat at the sushi bar. There were people dining in the booths, and no one else at the sushi bar (it was only about 6:30). I could hear people at hibachi tables somewhere.  I put my order in and had my sushi in front of me almost immediately. I had the sake (smoked salmon), red dragon maki roll and some other nigiri sushi that I can't recall right now (yellowtail maybe?). The smoked salmon was excellent. The maki roll was good. The 2 nigiri, maki roll and a small beer came to about $30. 

I'll return to try other items on the menu. 

This place is easy to get to with a giant parking lot out front. The decor feels a bit outdated and/or cheesy, but the service is good."}
{"text":"Finally a good Japanese restaurant in my area. The menu has plenty of options, including a few that I rarely see, such as the rice noodle soup. I'll have to return here to try some of their other options. 

The booths have high backs so privacy is good. The decor is standard orient slant (no pun intended). I saw a full bar but did not try out any beverage from there."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot in the west Cleveland area!  My friend and I split three appetizers (tuna tataki, marinated beef and scallions, and edamame) and then several servings of nigiri (magoro, yellowtail, eel, fish roe) and several rolls.  Absolutely everything was melt-in-your-mouth outstanding, and the portions sizes and prices were completely reasonable.  The waitstaff treated us well.  
In the words of the Terminator....\"I'll be back!\".....and hopefully soon."}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time and i have to say i was not impressed at all my girl ordered hibachi and there was no flavor at all and the sushi was just ok that was my first and last time visiting this establishment"}
{"text":"It's better than that other sushi place down road in Crocker Park.  Was excited to see a Hamachi collar on the menu, but unfortunately it was overcooked and very bland.  The sushi itself is decent.  Nothing wrong with it, but not great either.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"This place really depends a lot on which cook you get sometimes it can be top notch and other times it's mediocre. Our last chef must have been new because he put all the meat on at one time and didn't cook the rice long at all. When you have the right cook it's unbelievable and worth the money when you don't it really is a disappointment."}
{"text":"I love Arashi! This is my go-to hibachi place and I often take friends here for special occasions. I think that the price is very fair. The food has consistently been delicious and I love their green tea ice cream. Their sushi is also pretty good but I definitely usually go here for hibachi. I'm always seated very quickly and I love the mellow, quiet vibe that the place usually has.


The reason I am giving this 4/5 stars is because of the weird time period in which they close mid-day. I sometimes forget this and realize I can't go there for a late lunch/early dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi stops in Westlake
Prices are good sushi taste fresh, the staff is always great. We go here often try the baby octopus appetizer! Delicious"}
{"text":"After realizing how bad the Asian food take out places around us are, my wife and I came here instead. What a great move! The hibachi side was busy with loud parties, but the other side was perfect. Server was very efficient. Drinks came quickly and were excellent. We substituted other soups for the included miso soup and both were perfect for a cold night. I had the seafood teriyaki with big chunks of lobster as well as tasty scallops and shrimp. My wife's chicken tempura was very unique and very good. Brave the construction site just outside their door and get here!"}
{"text":"Didn't have a good first experience here... Waiter didn't listen to our order and messed up our sushi order... They did fix it, the hibachi was real bland and we were both sick a few hours later .. Wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and in large amounts. The staff was friendly and the price was on par with other Hibachi Grills."}
{"text":"Finally a good sushi place on the west side of Cleveland. This restaurant has changed hands a number of times and is finally running well. I hope the owners keep doing what they are doing and we'll keep sending business their way. Just took my brother and his fiance and had a blast with the hibachi as well. There are @ least 7 hibachi tables and they chefs and staff are super nice. Definitely WILL be going back."}
{"text":"The best hibachi that I have ever had! Sushi very good, only had 1 small roll. Our chef was beyond amazing, and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. The best Chinese sushi that I have had in all of Cleveland. Creative sushi rolls, full of flavor and fresh tasting. The Chinese tea is the best I have had in the USA and is brewed while leaf style... The owner obtains it direct from his home province in China and even sells it if you cannot find it here. The atmosphere is typical, but quiet, clean and comfortable. I highly recommend this place for sushi rolls and tea at lunch time."}
{"text":"Horrible. We didn't even stay. The server threw the menu down and no one came to greet us. We left, and went to Cafe Tandoor across the lot. They are awesome, beautiful people."}
{"text":"Arashi is our go-to for hibachi in the area. We've always had very good experiences here as well. Hibachi is pretty expensive when prepared as a show and not just as a prepared dish. The sushi here is always well-made and fresh which is important when you're having raw anything. Our server was attentive and took great care of us throughout as well."}
{"text":"Great sushi with attentive service, what more could you ask for? Look forward to coming back for the hibachi."}
{"text":"Had their sushi for the first time after being recommended by a friend.  The sushi was just as good as anywhere else around Cleveland, except maybe Vengs.  The entrees that I saw coming out looked phenomenal though."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick dinner before a business meeting and I was very pleased with my experience.  The staff were efficient, knowledgeable, friendly, and very helpful.  Checked back to make sure my meal was good, etc.

I had the gyoza (Japanese dumplings) and they were served hot, a nice serving size, and with a good dipping sauce.

For my entrée I had the pad Thai, which was wonderful!  Sizzling hot, just the right amount of spice and kick to it, filled with lots of veggies and plenty of shrimp and chicken.  It was a delightful dish and a good sized portion.

The price is reasonable and the food fresh and tasty!

Worth the money and worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Never busy, weird hours and got insanely sick the last time I went. So did my dad and my son. So needless to say we have an aversion to the place now. We all had sushi."}
{"text":"We are a family of four including a 9 and a 5 year old. Went right after noon on a Sunday.  We were pleasantly surprised to find.bone child eats free (up to $12) with two paid adults. The decor and atmosphere was pleasing. The staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. We came for hibachi. Our waiter Randy was new and did a wonderful job. Our Chef/Entertainment was Bao. He was fun and high energy. Kept the children laughing and engaged. He did all the standard tricks and a few of his own. Including balloon animals for the kids when he was done. We had the rock shrimp tempura with cream sauce. Very yummy and cooked to perfection. Between the four of us we had everything except chicken. It was all very tasty. An overall Wonderful lunch experience :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi I ever had. Fresh, not too saucy. I had the eel, lobster and tuna. All of them are fantastic. The owner is courteous and friendly, very proud of what they serve. I love tea. The tea served here is the best one I ever had, much to my surprise."}
{"text":"I want to thank the employee Chung for his tremendous service last Thursday 9 June for dinner. First time in the area, my husband was here for work, me tagging along. Of course, not always easy traveling as we're both vegan. Chung recommended the veg sushi and an off-the-menu tempura sweet potato sushi (even if you're not vegan - you need to try this!!!). We also split a vegetable udon noodle dish, which he even double checked all the ingredients to make sure they were vegan friendly. Not only can he made good recommendations and impeccable, friendly sesvice, he makes a good drink too. So, I guess you can say, when you find a quaint and caring restaurant with wonderful servers, it's not that hard traveling as a vegan. Wish I snapped a photo, but there's always next time. Thanks Chung!"}
{"text":"i've gotten sushi to go from here on two occasions. the first time, it was alright. not the best, but not the worst. i live very close and i went there more for convenience than anything else. got it a 2nd time tonight and decided that was the last time for sushi. what really disturbed me was that the crab meat in my spider crab roll was a greyish/black color. i tried to look online to see if spider crab looks differently after cooking than regular crab, but there wasn't a clear answer. it turns my stomach just thinking about it and i'm really hoping i don't get sick. haven't tried the hibachi, so i can't speak on that. i have a friend who goes here a lot for that, so maybe that will be a better experience."}
{"text":"Service the worst-had to send my 10year -old son's order of shrimp and fried rice back because I specifically said- NO vegetables! Came back twice with vegetables in the rice !! And they tried to bill me $21.95 for a kids meal $13.95. Thank goodness I caught it on the bill. The floors were sticky when we sat near the sushi bar. Basically there are other great restaurants in the area. Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"I don't want to call myself a hibachi connoisseur I just really love it! I could probably eat it everyday if it wouldn't give me high cholesterol and make me 300 lbs.  A few friends and I were really craving it yesterday so we decided to try this place for the first time... it may now be my favorite! 

It was a Tuesday night and there was only three of us, but that did not bother the staff in the least bit that they had to sit us alone and do a whole show for us.  Our waitress was probably one of the best I have had, super friendly and on top of her game.  Then our chef was seasoned and great.  Kept us laughing, did all the tricks, showed off and still even squirt Saki in our mouths.  I wasn't expecting to be so impressed but I definitely was.  

The food was seasoned well and nothing was overcooked, which is easy to happen on those flat tops.  I was able to get rice and noodles with my meal so I had plenty left over to take home.  Saying I have an addiction to Yum Yum/Shrimp sauce may be an understatement.  I love it on everything; rice, noodles, vegetables, meat, shrimp, the works.  They pre-serve you the sauces there and all of my friends and I loved it so we asked if we could have some more and she did not only deliver she brought us the entire squirt bottle, so we were definitely not running out again.  

I will definitely be back and this will be my go-to for Hibachi from now on.  I am excited to go back and try the Sushi."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Alcohol selection leaves to be desired but the rolls we had were JUST ok. Service tonight was awful. Had to track down other waiters to get what we needed. Not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Try it for the first time food was poorly cooked veggie rice had so much oil on it my rice was burn chicken wing was so salty big and nasty looking and very over price we"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday on a Tuesday for their 1/2 off rolls for dinner. I sat at the bar for a minute and they had a decent selection of liquor and Japanese beer. Service was good at the bar and once my friends came we ate in the Hibachi room. The Hibachi chef was great he did the usual tricks. I just got 3-4 rolls for dinner including the spicy tuna my favorite, a crunchy shrimp, unagi roll and a rainbow roll. The sushi was great and tasted fresh. My friends ordered hibachi which came out great. I definitely plan on coming back here again as it was some of the best sushi I have had in the area in a long time."}
{"text":"If you want good sushi find another place.  Oh, was I dissapointed. Few customers.  I should have stuck to my gut that it wasn't going to be good.  Expensive by any standard. Sushi was barely OK.  I come from California and appreciate sushi.  Arashi's sushi just didn't taste fresh. Some pieces appeared dryish looking and had a metallic after taste.  Hibacchi chicken was so dry I sent it back with instructions to chef that if this was best they could do, please let me know so I could order something else. Replacment came back just as dry as first order. When I complained that 3 people  took a sample and agreed it was just as dry (think chicken served at a wedding), the waiter simply said he would pass along my commments.  No offer to refund, or even a small gesture to make it right in any way.

IM TELLING YOU IF YOU KNOW GOOD SUSHI GO SOMEWHERE ELSE."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, great food / service and highly recommend. We came for a going away party and had a blast. The hibachi chef was entertaining and the group had a mix of hibachi and sushi."}
{"text":"My husband, srepson and I stopped at Arashi for hibachi after a recent trip to Cabela's in Avon on a late Sunday afternoon.  Although I was skeptical - there were no other diners at the grills - we asked to be seated anyway.

The restaurant is gorgeous!  The bar area is modern with black/blue lights illuminating the featured alcohol.  The bar is intriguing during the day... I can only imagine how amazing it is at night!  The hibachi grills are separated from the bar-area by walls of windows, so my stepson was able to watch the football games during our dinner.

We ordered the Philadelphia Roll, the Alaska Roll and one order of Edamame for appetizers (I was disappointed at the small size of the Edamame... a cup for the three of us - I feel that the waitress should have warned us).  The rolls and Edamame were excellent!  The waitress came back to our table too many times to check on us, which made us feel rushed.  We gently sent her away while we visited and enjoyed our time together.

Though he loves Asian food my stepson has never had hibachi... I couldn't wait for the floorshow!!!

Enter:  our Chef, \"Sumo\"!  This gentleman is larger than life!!!  He came to our grill and immediately connected with us!  We ordered steaks and shrimp and scallops and noodles and rice!  Sumo tossed eggs around with a spatula... this trick is often performed at other hibachi grills but it was especially exciting because my stepson had never witnessed such a thing.  We were alone at our grill and ordered as we pleased.  Every one of our whims was attended to... we snapped scrambled eggs out of the air like dogs catching frisbees... my husband and I opened our mouths to welcome streams of Sake from a squeeze bottle.  Sumo offered a squeeze bottle of cranberry juice to my stepson - Sumo called it \"Baby Sake\".  SO MUCH FUN!

Sumo was easy on the salt, generous with the sesame seeds, and cooked our steaks perfectly!  The rice at Arashi is amazing but the noodles are the BOMB!!!

I wish we lived closer!!!  WE LOVE SUMO!"}
{"text":"Clearly not a sushi focus. For example, the Saba (mackerel) was dry and flavorless.

The spicy tuna and spicy salmon were indistinguishable in flavor, possibly due to an over-reliance on heavy spice and the bizarre addition of tempura sprinkles inside the nori wrapper. Possibly because they were literally the same tuna/salmon salad on the inside.

The other rolls were unremarkable, the seaweed salad was the usual gelatinous mass, but the miso soup was delicious!

I have not yet tried the hibachi at this restaurant, so perhaps I should be gentle. Perhaps I can update this review if I ever get the chance to come back with hibachi in mind.

But for the prices I paid for this sushi, I expect a far superior meal."}
{"text":"Good food, a fun chef and enjoyable dinner for me and my wife.  Both our steaks were cooked great rice was excellent.  Great first experience at a Japanese steak house"}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving this restaurant 5 stars is because of the host who seated me. Five stars, in my opinion, should be reserved for perfect. It is 12:45 on a Wednesday and the host sears me with the dinner menu only.  If it wasn't for another yelper who had recommended the lunch pad Thai I wouldn't have know a lunch menu existed.
Once my waitress arrived, I asked her if there was a lunch menu & she went and grabbed it.  There are several reasonably priced menu items, but I did go with the lunch pad Thai (which also was served with standard soup & ginger salad). It was delicious. My server had warned me about the spice level, but truly, it was very mild heat - so if you love spice, you might want to see if they could amp it up.  Speaking of my server, she was polite & attentive.
I am interested in the sushi offerings so another review for the future."}
{"text":"I have eaten there twice- always the sushi bar and allowed the sushi chef to be creative. Excellant food and service. Used to be Sakura in Lakewood.
Great staff too"}
{"text":"MAKE SURE YOU LOOK AT YOUR BILL BEFORE PAYING!!!

Just moved to Westlake and had the whole family in town. Stopped here for hibachi and sushi on a Saturday night. The entire night was great here. Food was amazing, the cook was the best we have ever had at a Japanese Steakhouse, and the sushi was top notch.....But all of that went out the window when our server FOLLOWED US OUT TO OUR CAR and complained that we didn't tip him on our $300+ bill. BE ADVISED: at this restaurant, they sneakily include a 20% gratuity on the very bottom of the bill. My brother noticed this 20% gratuity already included so we didn't even think of adding even more of a tip. 

Either our server did not know about the gratuity included or he was just trying to scam us for more $$$, but never......never, ever, ever, ever, ever run out of the restaurant and follow a customer to their car at 10:00pm and demand a tip. Because of this we will NEVER return here and will tell everyone we know to never patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"Not really impressed at all to be honest. Came for lunch and kitchen closes at 2:30. Teriyaki chicken was just grilled chicken with sauce poured on top and sushi was mediocre. Decor was decent- pretty gaudy. *oh there goes a fly*"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for sushi so out you want steak sushi and mainly fish this is were you should go. The staff are very polite and have helped with chopsticks and much more of you are wanting a meal this is the place to go even on your birthday you will love this place with spoiler alert sparklers for a birthday so three dessert is delicious. All of the food here is delicious but some of the things are expensive such as the love boat for 2 going for 50 dollars so it is not worth that but everything else is worth it so when you ate looking for a place to eat then this is the place to go so put it in your phone and head for some of the best sushi ever."}
{"text":"I would love nothing more than for a sushi place to open in Lakewood, but for now, I go to Arashi across from Crocker Park. This restaurant is huge and they offer sushi on one half and hibachi on the other. Their menu is large and has options for every type of Japanese food you could want. I always get their seaweed salad which is a huge portion and almost fills me up before I've even gotten my roll. I love trying different rolls and a couple of my favorites are the Green River, Spider and New York. There are so many others to choose from that sound equally as delicious. I've never eaten on the hibachi side, but you can always hear people laughing and having a good time over there. I think it's a great option for large groups of people or parties."}
{"text":"I like my food spicy. If I'm ordering a spicy tuna roll, I want it to have some kick, not just a bunch of mayo. 

Arashi gets 4-stars for making a properly sized spicy tuna roll that's actually spicy. In fact, you couldn't even tell the tuna had mayo in it, which I loved. The rolls seemed fresh enough and I loved that you can get hibachi and/or order from their noodle/rice dish menu. I only tried the sushi for my first visit, but I'm sure I'll be back to try more, considering there are no Japanese or sushi restaurants in Lakewood. 

Again, even the specialty rolls aren't so big you can't fit them in your mouth. I'm all about value, but if I can't eat a piece of a sushi roll without unhinging my jaw, I'm not really a fan. I don't want chipmunk cheeks, OK? The miso soup was delicious, nothing super special though. And we also tried the shrimp tempura appetizer, which I expected to have more shrimp, but was pleasantly surprised with some delicious veggies, too! 

Service was speedy and I really have no complaints about this place. Can't wait to stop back in and try some more things."}
{"text":"The sushi is ok here, not awesome but definitely not great. I got the love boat with my wife. I think the portion was good enough for us. It comes with a Miso soup or salad. I was disappointed they didn't have toro. In addition, they don't have sweet shrimp.  Service is very good though."}
{"text":"Oh Cleveland, stop embarrassing yourself by proclaiming this place \"good.\" Aside from the sweet and excellent service, the food-making and eating part of the restaurant is horrible. 

First, it's clear that the \"Japanese\" part of the equation is a very loose interpretation of what Japanese food is.  It's more like Japanese food filtered through a Chinese instagram lens. 
The flavors aren't even close to anything resembling washoku.  We dumped the leftovers.

Get thee to Shuhei (the city isn't THAT big) for a better option."}
{"text":"Good sushi, and the teriyaki sauce is pretty awesome.  The wait staff is not that great though and have difficulty understanding English."}
{"text":"Run... Just run away as fast as you can. The sushi is horrible. It should have been thrown out the day before. Their salmon was slimy, the tuna was so red and old it began to fall apart when I picked it up. They try to over compensate with large portions. Way too big to eat in one bite, keep in mind this was sashimi (just fish, no rice). Their rice was cold (which is just so easy to fix, keep it in the rice cooker till it's ready to serve) and the tea was a couple of tea bags in a pot. The tea cups are too small for an more than a few sips. I think the cups are actually meant for serving saki. I may as well have been drinking from a shot glass. The tea pot was missing the plastic end in the spout so I ended up spilling tea all over the bar. In most Japanese restaurants the server would be responsible for keeping your tea cup full. The staff was friendly but there are so many things wrong with this place it could be dangerous."}
{"text":"I'm not trying to be a novelist on here so I'll keep it short. I have eaten at a lot of Japanese Steak Houses, I couldn't even begin to count the number of different Steak Houses I've been to. I can honestly say that the food was the best that I've had at any of them at Arashi. The show at the Hibachi Grill wasn't that flashiest I've seen before, but the food was the best."}
{"text":"I love hibachi! I know it's not super authentic Japanese but I love it regardless. I decided to give my beloved Daishin a break & try Arashi to change it up a bit. I got the chicken & shrimp hibachi. Both the chicken & shrimp were flavorful. The fried rice was really good as well. 

I wasn't a big fan of the salad dressing on the salad (it was kind of watered down), onion soup, & the spring rolls.

The waiter was great. Super friendly & very accommodating. I didn't care for the chef too much though. He didn't seem right for some reason & I didn't care for his constant joking. 

Do I think it's better than Daishin? No! Even though I liked most of my meal, I still like the vibe, the food better, & you get more for your money at Daishin."}
{"text":"If I wanted to eat crappy Japanese food, I'd just go to Noodlecat."}
{"text":"Everybody working there was nice!  Sadly, the food was absolutely horrible.  Chicken hibachi was undercooked (I probably have salmonella now) and the fried rice was awful.  I did like the disco lights they threw up during happy birthday, though."}
{"text":"Kinda average, especially when compared to other hibachi places like Benihana, etc. We went after a movie for some hibachi and sat at a hibachi table. I think we had been here closer to when they first opened but haven't been back in several years.

Our server seemed to have tables in the non hibachi part of restaurant and was busy over there, fortunately we didn't need much from server. Our chef was humorous and engaged with the the table.  They had music playing in the dining room that I didn't mind but felt a little out of place and maybe wasn't as appreciated by the older guests in our party. Restaurant looked like it's time for a deep clean but wasn't gross just maybe a little neglected. 

The food. I had surf and turf hibachi meal. The soup and salad came out at the same time which isn't the norm in my hibachi experiences. The salad had way to much dressing on it. The soup broth had good onion flavor but was kind of meh. I did t worry too much as I usually take it easy on these and save room for the entree part. The veggies were good but the fried rice wasn't great in my opinion. I think either the grill needed deep cleaned as the rice really picked up a sort of residual grill flavor. The filet was very tender and good and the lobster was also good. Overall it was decent but not so great I'd be anxious to return."}
{"text":"The recent downgrade from 5 to 2 stars is due to their horrible customer service! We came with a party of 13 and instead of giving us two tables, they crammed us all the way around one table so that several guests were actually sitting at the adjoining table with another family -- unbelievable! There were several empty tables and even though we had reservations and even asked to be moved, the owner said NO! True story and very disappointing! The rest of my original review remains (mostly) the same. Call me crazy, but Christmas wouldn't be the same without a flaming onion volcano, thanks to our annual holiday pilgrimage to Arashi. It's a tradition we all love! We go back during the year too because it's hard to stay away."}
{"text":"Great hibachi, service, and yum yum sauce! Our cook was funny, all the same corny hibachi jokes with a few originals thrown in. Lunch is reasonably priced but doesn't have combos so one of us ordered shrimp, the other chicken, and we exchanged. Lunch includes fried rice, onion soup, salad with ginger dressing, and veggies as well. We left full and with leftovers."}
{"text":"Great service, subpar cuisine. Hibachi is not done on hibachi grill if there aren't enough people. Very disappointed in their policy and deceit."}
{"text":"I am so regretting went to this restaurant. Found it on google, and the reviews looked great. Went in, we wait for 10 minuets for server to come by the table. He was nice and joking around. When the food came, everything looks good! We thought we pick a right place, but not the case. I love Sushi, but I can't even finish 1/4 of it. Four of us left almost everything on the table. We just can't took another bite, because the fish wasn't fresh at all. And left a nasty taste in our mouth for long time. So disappointed, and server came check with us. When I told him about it, he just walked away without saying anything. Worse experience ever!!!"}
{"text":"Doing the Ichiban Combo hibachi style! Come & get it! The best part is asking the owner Oscar to make a mai-thai that will thai you over! Great service, food, and drinks. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The service was good but the sushi was just okay. It was nothing to write home about. I have had a better sushi elsewhere. There isn't anything wrong with this place. It just isn't the best I have had. Won't be likely to return."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant when it was in Lakewood and called Sakura. Same everything as it was before. We take our daughter here for hibachi every year for her birthday and we eat here when we crave Japanese. 
I love their gyoza, Tori Karage and their tempura. My husband eats sushi and anything else he feel like trying.
Kids eat free hibachi with adult purchase on Sunday's. We still haven't made it there for that yet. 
I love this place! I crave their gyoza and hope they are around for years to come!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm the first to admit that I'm the polar opposite of a sushi purist. Shrimp tempura is really as adventurous as I get. I get it, that's the cheese pizza of the sushi world. I don't give a damn, it's delicious. And my favorite shrimp tempura roll comes from Arashi. 

As another review mentioned, the sushi here is appropriately sized, which I appreciate. I'm not sure what's with the whole jumbo sized sushi burrito trend, but it's certainly not how sushi is intended to be served and Arashi respects that. 

As far as actual hibachi goes, I'm not that crazy about the cuisine that it's something I frequent - but that being said when it's my choice to pick a hibachi restaurant 100% of the time I'll pick Arashi. The first time I dined here was years ago with my grandmother and I remembered it being a really enjoyable time. We recently went here again for my husband's work party, and it was seriously a blast. Our chef was outrageously funny and kept us laughing and impressed the entire time.

I've never had anything but a positive experience here, whether it be dining in or picking up take out. Dining at Arashi is always a pleasure!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner here Friday after work and didnt stay long. This use to be our favorite place for sushi. Over the last 4 years we have visited and the sushi has declined in quality consistently. We returned an entire Manhattan role because it wasn't fresh.  The seafood was not fresh and it did not smell good - it smelled and tasted fishy! It was disgusting.  The color was off too, it looked like  the ingreedients had sat out in the heat. It was really bad.  We spit it out in fear of food poisoning and asked for a refund.  

If you want quality Sushi go to Ginko in Tremont!"}
{"text":"Visited last night for a hibachi dinner. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. I brought my own cake and the host without prompting asked if I would like them to store it in the refrigerator. We were seated and greeted by our waitress who gave great suggestions about fun cocktails to try! I got the Tokyo Rose which is served in a martini glass"}
{"text":"I'm sitting at the hibachi grill with the family right now. I'm so freaking full it's not funny. The service was better than benihana, caught some food had some wine shot at me out of a squeeze bottle and heard a fah rah rah rah rah joke. My scallops were cooked prefectly and my wife's steak was about 20oz for the hibachi order. 5/5 would go again"}
{"text":"Good sushi, good main courses but quite overpriced. The service is good as well, but the hibachi on the one side of the restaurant plays loud music that is accompanied by a bizarre laser light show that prompts children to get up, yell, and dance while you're trying to eat your meal. Other than that, though, it was a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Tonight i finally had hibachi thete after havung sushi 5× before. We started with saki vombs at the bar and our bartender was very cool, we sampled a very fragrant saki which i loved. Then dinner, so i loved my meal and our hibachi guy was awesome. The decor though in a big drab room. I would suggest 3 huge murals on those big empty walls and bring the lights down roo. The birthday vibe was cool, but the music and lasers reminded me of a stripper club. Which wasnt nessesarly a bas thing. Left full happy and buzzed"}
{"text":"Small rolls, loose rolled sushi, several fell apart. Not impressed what so ever. We tried this place about 8 months ago, it was ok at best, decided to try it again. We will find somewhere else our next time. 
Stupid is as stupid does... We tried it again, again months later, and again it reaffirmed that the quality of this sushi is just not good."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Eel plate with 3 little pieces of eel. Food is absolutely not authentic. Not recommended at all. If you want to try real Japanese cuisine, don't bother coming to this place."}
{"text":"This post was written in summer 2012. For some reason it's saved as a draft and never got posted.

I was craving for some good Japanese ramen and chose to go to this place. After I was directed to a table, I sat there for more than 5 minutes just to get a waiter to come to my table again and ask my order. It is also very disappointing that their ramen is completely instant noodle from Korea, same sauce, same noodle - something you can buy for $1-2 at Korean market. 

I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Great food, love their hibachi. To bad the owners too cheap to turn the air on in the hibachi room. Made our dinner plans very unenjoyable."}
{"text":"Five minutes can decide everything. You know the feeling when you can't decide what kind of food you want to eat? I couldn't decide between Japanese food and Thai food but I decided to go to Arashi because it was slightly closer to I-90 from Oberlin. I waited five minutes to be seated and no hostess showed up. In those critical five minutes, I not only decided to get up and leave this \"fine\" establishment to go get Thai food instead at Thai Spice. Glad I got my sushi fix the next day at Ginko instead."}
{"text":"They have a great hibachi,and the chicken fried rice is bank. Honestly I  would of gave them  a 5 star but the service was slow! I'm not hating on the place. Just keeping it real! I will def go back for the food."}
{"text":"Simply put, sushi was the bomb!  If anyone knows of a better sushi place let me know.  Get that playboy roll or Manhatten!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and at a typical Hibachi price, but usually all Hibachi food is delish with all the butter and seasoning. It's the show that really makes Hibachi special and this place falls short. Everytime we go we get the same chef and he barely interacts with you or talks with you. He does a little show in the beginning and then its over.. he looks miserable. Try Samurai in Strongsville.. same pricing and the show is better.. plus you get noodles :) It's a more cost effective but still fun environment without having the spend the upcharge for Shinto."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  The only reason this restaurant doesn't have 5 stars is because the reviewers below me are sushi snobs (no lie, they all agree it's good food!).  Arashi Japan provides great food for a moderate price (not the cheapest, but not the most expensive sushi I've ever had, either).  The filet mignon hibachi is always perfectly cooked.  The fried rice is made fresh and pairs perfectly with the home-made \"yum yum\" sauce.  And the shrimp tempura roll is huge (try to eat a slice in one bite...no, don't really).  I'm in the general Cleveland area often and I always make it a point to stop here at least once on each trip.

To the commenter that stated they aren't as good as Asuka: IT'S THE SAME RESTAURANT!  It never changed hands, they just remodeled and changed the name!  Same food, same staff. :)"}
{"text":"Came in for Sunday dinner and sat at the bar. Ordered the Sashimi/Sushi combo with a glass of sake. I thought the texture of the fish seemed a bit off. I ended the meal the tempura ice cream and thought that was pretty tasty. 

I thought the sushi was okay. I might come again, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"The sushi is not good quality and so expensive ! The got the mango role that was 14$!! Thinking it would be good bc of the price it was nasty n. Shrimp inside was gray !! Idk wth kind of shrimp that is??  I went to this place originally because I was craving sushi and didn't want to drive to Mizu sushi where I usually go but it being all the way in Parma I went to this because it was in Westlake. The spicy tuna and California was average but the spider and mango were nasty and a waste of money oh and they charge you for condiments  I got sick after eating there sushi  wasted 50$ down the drain! Det recomnd going some where else for sushi not here ! Mizu in Parma is 100 times between and giant eagle across the street from this place sells better quality and taste !"}
{"text":"I'm not happy at all. I ordered their hibachi meal expecting it to be what you get in the restaurant and it is not at all. For 40$ this meal is not worth it. Very let down and I feel ripped off."}
{"text":"I swear this is the only place I've ever tried sushi and liked!! 
Recently when I went here, we ordered take out. I got the honey shrimp. It was so great even the next day. Nothing but good things to say. Food quality far surpasses their prices."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I have a great time. The food is pretty decent and the staff are great! The place isn't always packed so getting a hibachi seat isn't hard to do. They have a steady flow off clientele and it's a good vibe there. Drink prices are okay, but they offer some great mixed drink items to choose from. We visit at least 3 times a year and will continue doing so!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service. Stopped here for dinner while traveling through the area. This was a SUPER choice! Even though we arrived quite late in the evening, the staff was extremely friendly and made us feel very welcome. We at near the sushi bar, not the hibachi, so I can't comment on that. I can tell you that he sushi we ordered was very fresh and very tasty. Our daughter had appetizers and soup and enjoyed those too.  Good selection of wines by the glass, the decor is beautiful and spotlessly clean, EXCELLENT service! Wish we lived closer because we'd certainly go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Random Sunday at 330 so needless to say, I was one of the only people there... BUT service was very pleasant and quick. Ginger dressing on my side salad was on point however, 3.50 for a rameken of lettuce with no toppings is a little steep haha.

I got a roll of sushi called fire island and it was pretty good! Considering we don't have many options for sushi, I'd say that I will definately be back for another roll in the future"}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  Had hibachi for lunch and the experience was great.  Very entertaining and plenty of food to take home.  First time here, but would definitely come again.  I ordered shrimp hibachi and loved it."}
{"text":"We were greeted quickly and sat within 2 minutes of walking in. The waiter was also nice. The restaurant itself needs a serious cleaning and remodeling. The seats in the sushi restaurant side has booths that are badly damaged and there's quite a bit of dust and stains everywhere. The sushi/noodle dishes are also very mediocre. Tonight I received gray beef. This wasn't high quality beef that should be eaten mid-rare so I sent it back to be cooked some more. The ramen use to be loaded with veggies but tonight, I received a few pieces of carrots and mushrooms and nothing else. Also, I recognize the ramen to be a commercial brand of Shin Ramen so this isn't a \"from scratch\" dish. The tuna roll that we ordered was also super fishy which was a direct indication of lack of freshness. Not really going back. The cost is too high for such low quality food. There's too much competition in town between Shinto and Wasabi where I can trust the quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for sushi on a Weds afternoon. We were seated immediately and the restaurant was pretty empty (maybe 3 other tables there), but our waiter still took over 10 mins to come to our table. He was friendly, but geez he was so slow. Every time we needed him, or our check, we had to go look for him because he was nowhere to be found. We ordered 5 rolls total, and they were okay, but not great. The experience and food quality just wasn't really worth the money, in my opinion. I would have been just as well off going to Giant Eagle and getting a few rolls there. We probably won't return, and will continue our search for a great sushi place."}
{"text":"From California and visiting family in the area. Had a great dinner with a great chef--chef Sumo."}
{"text":"Almost made the drive into the city for a Japanese restaurant with better reviews but glad we saved the gas.  Arashi had very good sushi with good presentation, service, and atmosphere.  Save the drive if you're close to Westlake or make the drive for a good time with good food.  Not sure what happened with the other negative reviews but this place was first rate tonight."}
