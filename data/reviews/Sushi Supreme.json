{"text":"Sushi Supreme has excellent sushi at a great price. We end up eating here a few times a week because of the good food and fair price.

The service is always good. They usually have two or three people, and all of them help out. The food comes quickly too.

I would recommend the mango roll and any of the dragon rolls. Sushi bronze is also good, and at a great price."}
{"text":"Fantastic food for a fantastic price! The service is always fast and friendly. They bring out the soup and salad quickly, which is nice when you arrive hungry."}
{"text":"Gold dragon roll 3.5/5 
Chicken butter yaki 1.5/5
Tempura u-don 2/5

The lack of Asian patrons and the Chinese (not japanese) waitstaff gave us pause as we entered this non traditionally (and non japanese) decorated sushi store. It feels like it used to be a small bistro or bar. 

The gold dragon roll came very very quickly. Warm and fresh, the shrimp tempura was fried too lightly and was not crunchy, and the roll could have used a bit more sauce.

From bad to worse. 
The udon came. The tempura was bland without the soup, and was overpowered by the soup base when dunked. The noodles were overdone and soggy. 

The the butter yaki came. A platter of low cost ingredients (onions, carrots, zucchini, and broccoli) with a small portion of chicken that had only the slightest hints of being grilled. It looked very bland. 
How wrong I was.
It wasn't bland at all. It was super-salty, I'm guessing they used salt and salted butter with garlic salt and just a dash of salted pepper. I am not certain whether the terriyaki sauce was too sweet or just seemingly so after the overdose of salt. 

It seems our initial hesitation was well founded. I am saddened that yelp has failed me so for the first time.

N.B. If I were to review Russian or portugese or African cuisine for example (just not Asian), it would not be 100% reliable as I have not sampled enough to develop a relavent palette.  As such, please read the other reviews with a grain of salt. (which the restaurant provides in abundance)    

Overall value for money 
Service NA/5
Cleanliness 3.5/5
After meal satisfaction 2/5"}
{"text":"I order a take out yesterday. The salmon on Wasabi Roll was abundant. Love it! They also gave me 10% off for royal customer. For sure I will return."}
{"text":"Fast and cheap food - really enjoy their spicy maki roll set. The portion is large, and miso soup and salad are always part of the meal.

Enjoy the Korean fusion dish - spicy chicken dinner. Again, large portion and rapid service.

A nice place to go for a quick bite at a very decent price."}
{"text":"Sushi Supreme is our go to place when we're looking for a quick bite. The food is always really fresh, the service is great and the price is right! I always have the veggie bento box, which I often have a hard time finishing. Love, love, love."}
{"text":"Overall, OK - for the price to food is good value, but don't expect high quality delicious Japanese from this place.

I got a delivery order from Sushi Supreme, it was done through just-eat.ca so I can't comment on the over the phone service.

Everything I ordered came without issue.  Prices seem slightly below average for Japanese/sushi in the downtown core

Gyoza
Spring Rolls
Crunchy Spicy Salmon Roll
Beef Teriyaki Sushi Bento Box

Everything was very much standard fare, I found all of the fish apart from the Salmon to not be very fresh, still very much edible though.  The beef in the Teriyaki was somewhat tasteless but cooked properly. Spring Rolls were not soggy and had decent flavour. Rice was decent...

If you are hungry, on a tight budget, and not picky about sushi quality, this is a decent place to go, otherwise, there is better in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Delivery took over an hour. After an hour I called and was told it was on it way and ended up coming 20 minutes later. They should specify it is free delivery AND will take over an hour. My avocado salad was simply some iceberg lettuce topped with avocado and no dressing. The rice on my sushi wasn't sticky enough and was falling off. The best thing of the meal was the sweet potato tempura, but even that had been in the box for so long that they were mushy and no longer crunchy. Needless to say I was pretty disappointed after all the good reviews. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been a Sushi Supreme customer since 1998. Always good quality sushi. One of the best sushi restaurants in the city. I've either sat there, ordered catered sushi trays for family parties, or had house delivery. Never disappointed. Delivery service can be 45 mins to 1 hour, but no big deal. Worth the wait. Such good dollar value for a terriyaki dinner or bento box. Good place to go on a date too."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, reasonable prices. We ordered the party trays several times. Never got disappointed."}
{"text":"We live in the nieghbourhood and this is our \"go to\" sushi joint. It's not the best sushi I've ever had (I'd put it around the 80th percentile) but the food it cheap and (unlike most sushi places in Toronto) the service is really, really solid."}
{"text":"Great little place. Surprisingly busy. Always full of locals.  The staff are on point although sometimes overwhelmed by the customers.  Great and fresh fish"}
{"text":"Great price and consistently good execution. Food is fresh and the staff are great. Huge selection and lots of veggie options. Prices are amazing and 2 people can eat for under $40."}
{"text":"Great sushi in North Toronto! A little inconsistent (the quality and size of the roles changes a bit from day to day) but the food is always delicious. The staff is friendly and the menu has plenty of variety."}
{"text":"Nice modest small restaurant with great sushi.  Large menu with many options.  Most dishes come with salad and miso soup.  The upstairs seats about 30 and is used when the downstairs is over flowing.  Fast friendly wait staff.  Very reasonable prices.  I always get the Makimono set (18 pieces for $12).  My favourite sushi restaurant in all of Toronto.  Go there for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Talk about a cheap lunch.  For $6.99 I got a lunch special that included nicely made chicken teriyaki with soup salad and the usuals.  I have to say that this place rocks. I come here often for lunch becuase it's convenient it's a good deal and the service is great.

The portion sizes are pretty big and most people are full by the time they leave the restaurant.  Finally, I have to say the renovation in this location is much better than the other sushi restaurants in the area.  They did a great job with putting together the atmosphere.

I'm definitely a fan. :)"}
{"text":"The wait for a table is horrible even if it isnt busy. They only had 1 waiter which is probably the reason why I wasnt seated right away. Anyway, the food also took a while to make. Prices are reasonable. Their crunchy salmon roll is divine though. Probably wont come back unless im desperate for some sushi."}
{"text":"This place is just up the street from me and open late enough to fulfill my  boyfriend's random sushi cravings. 

The menu gets major props from the standpoint of a complete sushi novice as myself for having detailed descriptions of all the ingredients.

Also, the amount you get for the money you pay is fantastic.

There is an upstairs area also, which I've never been, but allows for large groups of up to 35 people (reservations needed)

The roll choices are plentiful (to the point of being almost redundant with just one ingredient differentiating some) but the sushi and sashimi combinations are chefs choice (substitutions are extra and you only get 2). 

The array of teriyaki, noodles and soup options are good too if you have sushi-phobic friends."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Quality of the sushi was barely ok. Never ever again. Very rude staff. They were running around, non-responsive. One of the staff dropped bunch of plates and just left it there."}
{"text":"4/5! we ordered from this place and the fish was very fresh! We ordered 4 rolls for 2 people and it was more than enough food. I recommend the spicy crunchy salmon and the sushi supreme roll! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I think this place is great for what it is. Sushi at a good price. Sure it is not the best of the best but for the price I think it is quite good.

I usually have the salmon bento box which is satisfactory. Also really like the tempura roll set. The mango roll is wonderful as well. Very refreshing.

The restaurant itself is comfy. Adequate seating and the servers are attentive."}
{"text":"As other reviews mention, you really can't beat the value at Sushi Supreme. Everything is fresh and tasty. I personally don't eat the sushi unless it's vegetarian, so can't comment on the fish quality, but have heard from family that it too is very good."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a sushi place that is on-par with After Rain. Since After Rain has closed down...it has been a long journey to find a good place with thick and fresh sashimi and huge rolls that aren't over-stuffed with rice. And I think I've finally found it!! Customer service was fast, attentive and nice. And the food was just fantastic....will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good for an ordinary but satisfying meal. Portions are big, quality is good, staff is polite and attentive, and price is very reasonable - dinner for $10. 

I tried the Sushi Bronze. 
- The rolls were huge. 
- Soup was well-balanced. They use the seaweed sheet instead of wakame. 
- Green salad was big, but the dressing was not too tasty: shredded carrot based.
- Sushi fish was fresh and a little tasty (not bland or very flavourful, somewhere in the middle) 

Overall, a very modest place. Don't expect mind blowing food, just a simple, decent meal. 

I would go back again. 



OTHER
Area is ok - quiet and removed from busy downtown core. Movie theatre and coffee shops nearby. Not much to do or see otherwise, but it is 5 mins walk from Davisville Subway Station, if you want to transit somewhere else afterwards."}
{"text":"The portions here are enormous! And it's really reasonably priced. Between three of us (including a couple of hefty-eating virile men), two Sushi Silvers and a Tempura Bento Box were far too much to finish off. The sushi salmon rolls had the biggest ratio of fish to rice I've ever seen.

The entire bill for the night, with a bottle of sake, was $51 tax and tip included. Service was quick and pleasant."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the week since i discovered it with my friends last week.

The rolls are pretty good and some of the best I've had in the area. The sushi pizza was delicious, the tempura was fresh and delicious, the rolls were delicious. Even the beef sashimi was better than i thought it would be.

The service is pretty good and nothing to really complain about , it's not the best but 
it's competent.

The restaurant is also a nice place to go have dinner. It's warm, cozy and comfortable. Would i go again? I'm already planning my next trip."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for takeout the other night, it was wonderful!

The takeout came quickly and still hot and fresh! It was absolutely delicious and we over-ordered, but it was so good we ended up finishing all of it!

My favorite were the spicy tuna and the Veggie King roll. The rolls are huge which is amazing but they def were 2-biters.

Now I can't wait to try it in person!"}
{"text":"I have only got take out from here but the staff are always friendly and welcoming and always quick and accurate with my order, the food is yummy :)"}
{"text":"Fast, cheap and really good Sushi. Def plan on coming back again."}
{"text":"Our drop by place for sushi after kids' morning class. Food here are fresh and good price. Will definitely show up every week."}
{"text":"Great place. Good food, plenty of it at cheap prices. We usually do takeout since we live in the neighbourhood. If you've only had their sushi you should try their noodles - you'll be doing yourself a favor. Shame that Rick (the owner) isn't there much anymore - he must be at their downtown location - it doesn't have as much spirit when he's not there - but Mrs. Rick keeps an eye on the place. Staff these days could be a little friendlier. You can tell it's a great place because there are four sushi restaurants within three blocks and this is the only one that's busy ALL the time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Prices are affordable and the sushi is really good. At the end of your meal they give you a sliced orange, which is always so juicy. I don't know where they get them but the best oranges I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Service is great and prompt . Food is delicious with great options , and price point is within budget."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed with this place.  I think they have new management or something?  We went for lunch a week or so ago and the service WAS TERRIBLE!!! The guy looked liked it was a bother to serve us.  

Anyway we figured it was a one time incident.  

Went there for dinner last night and we had the SAME server.  The new staff seemed confused when we asked if we could sit upstairs.  BTW we always sit upstairs with no issues.  The person seemed confused.  I mean can we or can't we sit upstairs?  How difficult was it to answer?  Anyway, we went up and there were people eating up there so I don't get it?

  They seemed to have it all badly managed now.  I have been going there for 8 years and now it is really going downhill.  What a disappointment!!!!  It was such a good place, with nice servers that remembered you, and your order."}
{"text":"This used to be a mediocre restaurant but the new owners have brought a fresh look and revised the menu completely. I've tried a few of their lunch specials, including set bento boxes and all-you-can-eat sushi.

Food is not of the greatest quality, but for the price (under$10) it's hard to beat. I was impressed by the quality of their ayce maki which, although not the greatest, is decent and not stuffed with rice. I tried their cooked food (chicken teriyaki) once and it tasted awful but I'm willing to give them a benefit of doubt and post an update when I try it again sometime.

Overall, can't go wrong with set lunches and will keep you wallet very happy."}
{"text":"I don't love the sushi here, but my husband thinks it is acceptable. We used to order from here if we crave sushi but is broke since the sushi here is very cheap, so we will order the platters and have food for a few meals. The sushi here is about the same level as supermarket sushi."}
{"text":"Fast? Yes. Friendly? Yes. Reasonably price? Maybe. Quality? Hmm...you get what you pay for. Their sashimi is really thin and small. Tuna and butter fish were tasteless. Their salad dressing was pretty good though. I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place that's just a couple of blocks away from my work. My coworker and I went there for lunch as he recommended it. 

The food and service are both pretty good! Fast service, which is always nice at lunch time when you have very little time. 

I ordered something off their bento special menu, which I highly recommend. You get a bit of everything in there. I got the beef bento box, which came with 3 pieces of California roll, 1 fried shrimp tempura, an assortment of veggie tempura, beef and rice. You also get the usual miso soup and green tea. All of that was for $8, can't go wrong with that. The reason I gave this place 4 out of 5 starts is the beef was a little chewy, which I didn't like. 

I will be sure to come back here if I want a lunch meal that's well priced with big portions!"}
{"text":"That's my favorite place for sushi in the area around Yonge and Davisville. The prices are reasonable and it is always fresh. My only disappointment is that they offer delivery in a very limited area and not to where I live. Hopefully they will expand their delivery area soon."}
{"text":"sushi ok, space ok, services good, price great!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 years and still loving it! Prices are reasonable, rolls are big, friendly staff."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out last night and it was great. Fast delivery (and free because I live close!) Food was great."}
{"text":"this place is great, as others put it, it's not the worlds best sushi but the prices are cheap and overall the sushi quality is really good, if you are a fan of Sushi on Bloor then you will love this place as it's almost identical, they also run the lunch special for just 6 bucks which includes 12 pieces of sushi, miso soup and salad.

Right now this place is a little unknown which is actually nice, it has about double the capacity of Sushi on Bloor and thankfully I've never seen it have the ridiculous lineups outside of the door which has become common for Sushi on Bloor."}
{"text":"I love sushi. I think I've tried most of the Japanese restaurants along that section of Yonge Street, and downtown in general. Today I finally decided to go to Sushi Supreme Fusion, since it had good reviews here.

The thing is, I never write reviews - but this was so unusually, unexpectedly bad that I had to. We ordered the Chirashi and the Silver Sushi. All of the sashimi looked and tasted like plastic. It seemed like no effort at all had been put into it, and it definitely wasn't very fresh. The Tamagoyaki was ice-cold and seemed to have just come from the fridge. Even the rice tasted old. This was undoubtedly the worst sushi I have ever eaten, not just in Toronto but anywhere at all. The only thing I genuinely enjoyed was the salad dressing.

Also, the service was pretty slow and abrupt, the soup and salad arrived in about fifteen minutes, and we never got refills of our tea. 

Maybe it was an off day - but I'm definitely never going back again. If you're looking for a similarly cheap, but also friendly and delicious sushi restaurant, I recommend Sushi & BBQ, which is just down the street."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for two - a selection of veggie rolls, a tuna and avocado roll and the wasabi roll. Tuna was toro and very fresh, salmon sashimi was perfect! Yummy miso soup and great portion of seaweed salad. 

Delivery was fast and efficient. Would definitely order from again. 

Happy!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best price:quality ratios I've come across in the city. The lunch prices are insanely cheap. The salmon always tastes fresh. Relatively friendly staff. My only criticism is the salad they serve with the lunch specials is topped with an unbearably sweet dressing which is a bummer as I love the traditional vinegar/sesame style dressing you usually get at Japanese restaurants. Great place though."}
{"text":"My star rating here is completely based on delivery experience.   While I understand there are busy nights,  it took over 1.5 hours for us to get our food.   We called after an hour and were told that it was on its way.   It showed up 45 mins later, and we live 5 mins away.   Next time it would be great for the restaurant to acknowledge they are behind and suggest we pick up our food.  

While soups where cold,  the rest of the food was quite good."}
{"text":"Recently me and my friend order the foods as a take out. Usually bento box comes with 3 Salmon rolls and 3 cucumbers. I usually order 6 salmon rolls in stead of 3 cucumbers but after back home they put 3 cucumbers and 3 avocados lol other day I ordered same one and they put 6 avocados lol other day they put 6 cucumbers. They made a mistake more than 5 times. I cannot laugh anymore. I mentioned them every time they mistook but they keep making mistake as usual. I feel this is on purpose. We started to check the inside before leave there but why should we do that? Me and my friend used to be Royal customers here like at least once a week we come here but we slowly away from there because of that. Me and my friend haven't been there since last end of March and we don't have any plan to go there up to now lol"}
{"text":"Their portions are good and the price is good. However,  the food quality is not amazing,  it is just medium quality."}
{"text":"Sushi Supreme is a great spot for vegetarians who don't eat seafood! Their menu offers options beyond the conventional avocado-cucumber. Instead, there are rolls like shitake mushroom, eggplant tempura, three-seaweed, vegetarian dragon (sweet tofu, avocado, asparagus etc.) and vegetarian heaven (gobo/burdock root, carrot, spinach). If you're looking for value and combos as a vegetarian, this place has that covered too, with a good selection of bentos and 18-piece sushi combos that include 6 types of rolls at $12. If you're really hungry or want to split a sushi coma with a friend, you can order a 50-piece sushi platter, which is $28 if you do takeout and $30 if you dine in, something that definitely tempted me during my visit! Maybe next time when I return to the neighbourhood... Service is also great, for example, while I was there, I happened to order a miso soup and the server was kind enough to advise that it was not in fact vegetarian---honesty and consideration that I doubly appreciated."}
{"text":"Sushi Supreme - definitely you get what you pay for here in terms of food quality.

Everything is good, but not excellent.

Prices are shockingly low.

I would come again for a cheap sushi dinner with low expectations."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Toronto by far. The food was delicious and the service was very quick. The salad roll is quite innovative which replaces rice with cucumber. Amazing idea for people who enjoy sushi but want to limit their carb intake. The miso soup is also out of this world. Ask for the secret dessert menu...

Also, my friend had the salmon lunch special which is a great value as well."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh sushi for a great price!With prompt and friendly service to boot.
We loved every dish we tried, the only negative thing I could say is that the tempura vegetables were cut fairly large and a bit of a struggle to eat. Will definitely be going there many many more times :) If you love sushi or are trying it for the first time I highly recommend Supreme Sushi, yummy!"}
{"text":"Close to home, and we had a TeamBuy coupon, so gave it a shot.  With a ton of sushi competitors, this place is definitely behind the others for quality.  Prices are about the same as everywhere else."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious and surprisingly reasonably priced. Highly recommend. Very good lunch specials from 12-5."}
{"text":"Sushi Supreme Fusion is the California roll of sushi restaurants -- it's substantial, affordable and will calm your sushi craving, but it's really nothing special.

The restaurant itself is lovely, with lots of tables but still lots of open space (definitely didn't feel cramped). Toward the back of the resto there's a sort of platform and the tables are raised. Also, everything seemed very clean, including the bathrooms. So overall a nice setting, far from a dive.

The menu was good, with lots of rolls and combos to choose from. I did find the restaurant name a little misleading; the place is called \"Sushi Supreme Fusion,\" and they had a few items in a \"fusion\" section, but I don't think any of them really qualified as such. Food was affordable and the portions were good but in terms of taste it didn't really blow me away. I'm not picky when it comes to presentation, but it kind of looked like they just shoved the rolls on the plate. That's a lot of \"buts,\" no? 

Service was great, although me and my friends were pretty much the only people in there at 6 pm on a Friday. 

Not a bad sushi experience, but not a particularly great one either. Like most of my three star reviews, I'd go back here if I was with friends who really wanted to go, but I wouldn't go out of my way to hit it up again."}
{"text":"Great food, not a noisy place. Dinner for two for $31 had about 24 pieces of delicious seafood variations."}
{"text":"Now has all-you-can-eat sushi!  My least favourite thing ever!  But my dining companion wanted all you can eat, and I am soooo agreeable.

Regular all you can eat is $18.99 -- with sashimi add $3.00.  

Service was fast but befuddled.  They forgot our bubble tea until we reminded them (and the bubble tea came....with no tapioca...so just...syrup drink), they said they were sold out of tuna sushi (even though it was 5:45 pm).  The food was mostly good, the highlights being the butterfish nigiri and the edamame came out super hot.  I'd go back, but I'm not convinced it's worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is small and feels comfortable. It likely seats 20. I think it's a gem. 

Sushi price and quality can vary a lot in Toronto. This is a good spot for good quality at a reasonable price. Their service is pretty spectacular, hence why I felt so at ease. 

They are humble and over deliver."}
{"text":"I end up going here on a weekly basis and it's my favorite spot in the Yonge/Eg area (even though it's more davisville!) It's def my favorite.

The sushi is cheap and the service is fast. It gets really busy around 7ish and then they open the upstairs, other than that I have never had to wait for a table more than 2-5 minutes. My favorite dish is the Gyoza Udon soup. Their soup is the very best I have had anywhere!! I literally crave it all the time. :(
But pretty much everything on that menu is tasty and the service is friendly. 

My boyfriend and I tend to spend max $35-40 if we're really hungry, but we can fill up for $30."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food and service is always great and fast. And it's not pricey, really good rolls though and there bento boxes are awesome! Just can be busy around dinner time so be sure to call ahead and reserve!"}
{"text":"I HAD to order sushi for delivery the other day because it was raining and there was a group of us working in the office, so we didn't have much of a choice

Sushi Supreme minutely redeemed itself with:
- Tuna Pizza Sushi: pretty good
- Nagima Yaki: Not at all a type of sushi but pretty yummy
- Seaweed Salad: good

Otherwise, i stand by my other reviews- the rest of their sushi are huge but absolutely NOT tasty"}
{"text":"The food was okay, miso soup was tasty.
My problem was I went the washrooms for a few minutes left half of my meal on the table, when I came back my food was gone and the table setting reset! What the hell?
Cute looking place, but make sure not to leave your food unattended!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I have been to this place many times and food is always very tasty and fresh! Free miso soup and tea which is always great! Highly recommend for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Over the last couple of years I have eaten here with a friend who loves sushi! I don't eat raw fish! 

So i always get the Bento box; California rolls, Chicken Teriyaki, Vegetable Tempura  and 2 Shrimp Tempura and it comes with the miso soup, salad and fresh fruit. The regular price is about $8 but you can also get this as a lunch special for about $6. 

The food is always fresh, hot and delicious. The decor is trendy to upscale yet you can walk in with jean shorts and a t-shirt and not feel out of place. There is this one male server we always get and he is hilarious and fun! He even got me to try a new dish which he comp'd! I wish I could remember his name, he never has a name tag on. Great guy!

Considering Sushi Supreme is on Yonge St it is super clean as well. From the restaurant to the washrooms, a plus plus in my books!!"}
{"text":"Can you say Supreme service and Supreme food!!! Wow this place is a Hidden gem and my Trusty Yelp app led me here with a party of 18 to celebrate my birthday. They sat us upstairs and were extremely attentive to all of our needs. Let me start off with the Portions....they are Massive and delicious! I ordered a Bento Box for $10 --- no that is not a typo... their prices are Insanely cheap compared to Most Sushi places I frequent and it is definitely worth it! They do not cheap out on portions regardless of the low low prices which is a huge bonus!!!

Our party ordered a school of sashimi and a ton of Kalbi beef ribs which were so friggin good! My bento box with terriyaki beef was delicious and they didnt cheap out on the Shrimp Tempura and salad they gave us either!

They also did not charge us a stupid cash grab \"plating fee\" for our ice cream cake we brought and did not \"auto charge\" a gratuity for our big table. They earned their tip and this awesome review with being so quick, efficient, friendly, and having delicious sushi!"}
{"text":"By far the worst Sushi my wife and I ever had.  We ended up throwing out our whole dinner as it was a to-go and didn't find out until we got home...and like the other reviewer said, I NEVER throw out food either!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi.  This place is terrible.  The last time i ate here the sashimi was so bad it was breaking into pieces as i was trying to pick it up with my chopsticks.  It was takeout and i threw it away after eating a few pieces.  I never throw out food.

AND their seaweed salad i ordered had ice in it and it had a freezer burn taste to it.  

AND the service is bad (i had to call 2 times before anybody picked up the phone for my order) 

AND the workers look like they just don't give a **** which makes me wonder what they do when customers aren't around.

The funny thing is they are only slightly cheaper than other spots in the area but the quality is much worse.  This place is good for cheapskates who don't know what descent sushi is and are willing to roll the dice with diarrhea to save two bucks."}
{"text":"I order from here once a week. The fish is very consistent and fresh. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Toronto I have to stop here for a sushi pizza. 
It's absolutely amazing. The rice patty makes it so good. I have no idea why these are so addicting but they are. 
The people here are also always friendly."}
{"text":"Sushi Supreme catered an event I was at last week and it was AWESOME. Memorable. Delicious. As in \"I want to fill my pockets with this yummy sushi and after I ate that I want to lick my pockets so I can enjoy it again\" 
I have had serious cravings ever since."}
{"text":"Nothing supreme about this place AT ALL. Really don't know why they would need a second floor. Ordered a lunch special - salmon roll and mango roll - and a salmon pizza and my girlfriend got the spicy chicken. I used to work at a sushi place and the salmon roll is by far the worse I have had. They didn't even have mango sauce for the mango roll and salmon pizza was very bland. The only decent food was the spicy chicken. So if you're craving for Japanese food, I would highly advise you not to come here, it will only ruin your appetite!!! Come here only if you want some Korean spicy chicken."}
{"text":"When was the last time you had your sushi while sitting on a giant boat shaped table? Never?? Well my friend, I think it's about time.

At Sushi Supreme you certainly get your bang for your buck.
I've been here numerous times and I've never been disappointed. 
If you decide to venture over there for lunch, you're in for an even better deal! (6.99-7.99)

Price aside, the sushi is good. Big portions and big pieces of avocado make me happy. Big pieces of avocado in sushi makes me even happier. 

Their Bento Box is my go to meal 97.7% of the time. I love it because it has variety. It starts with soup and salad, followed by 6 pieces of maki, vegetable and shrimp tempura all on top of the teriyaki grilled protein of your choice. And what better to end off a 11$ meal than with peeled oranges. 

Now thats value for complete Japanese satisfaction."}
{"text":"Came here when trying to find something new to eat then the usual restaurants around Yonge Eg before our Absolute Comedy show. Found Sushi Supreme via Yelp and gave it a try. Good decent Japanese & Korean food. Surprised by the amount of customers they get since its kind a bit of a walk from the main intersection. Nice waitress too."}
{"text":"I tried out this place after reference from someone at my gym & I was pleasantly surprised. The rolls are absolutely delicious & the reasonable pricing is even better. Hands down the best sushi spot I've ever been to."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely awesome lunch spot - probably the superior choice when compared to any sushi joints in the area. The supreme bento box at $10 is unbeatable in terms of value. Foods are cooked and seasoned very well, that complemented with quick/friendly service and clean/well maintained establishment easily made this place a personal favorite!!!"}
{"text":"so i havent had anything in the restaurant itself, but every time my dad invites us over and orders sushi, its from this place.

there were several vegetarian options like rolls with tofu in them, cucumber and avocado rolls and these rolls with yellow veggies in them.  in the take out trays they give you heaping portions of accouterments.  

twice i noticed someone in the group reach for some interesting looking roll that was all pink and shaped like a cylinder, like all other rolls, but all it was was a bunch of ginger wrapped up in saran wrap.  these were in addition to the clumps that sat across the tray from the golf balls of wasabi. 

the best part of the mix was definitely the sashimi.  each piece was about the size of a brownie.  it was clearly something that would befit the name \"hunk of\".

(its even fresh and tasty a couple days later...what up leftovers!!)"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot for  a late Saturday lunch. Their $6.50 lunch special is a steal (for TO sushi prices). I ordered the california and salmon roll. Miso soup and salad is included. Additionally, I ordered gyoza (which I did not like b/c it was not vegetable gyoza). Clearly, I had no intentions of eating dinner! The starter is unnecessary given the amount of food. Washed it down with green tea. 
Satisfied tummy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great quality food and very affordable prices. I came here with my sister for a lunch break and I ordered the salmon teriyaki lunch special while she had a bento box special. That miso soup was easily the best miso soup I've ever had (I've had a hella lot of miso soup too!). And the salmon was well cooked and delicious. I also really liked the ambience in here although we did have an annoying bee flying around our table. I'll definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout here. The salmon was edible and was worth the value paid for. However, what grossed me out was the tuna. It was super chewy and gross. Definitely did not feel fresh. The tuna sushi was actually worst than grocery store sushi. Will not return. You really get what you pay for. The value is amazing and I would stick to salmon rolls. Do not order anything with tuna."}
{"text":"Although they remain the cheapest lunch specials in the area, I'm sad to report the sushi lunch in particular the maki has been now consistently mediocre. I'm not sure if it's a matter of the couple new \"chefs\" they seem to have now rotating during lunch hours, but the maki is much smaller and filed litre with rice. Its fair to say, i am a regular, however they have yet to offer anything on the house during any of my lunches here. Now that the maki is more often a \"meh\" than a \"woop\" I might actually need to start shopping around again."}
{"text":"I was brought here by friends (two vegetarians in the group) and I witnessed how they celebrated finally finding a haven from all the sad cucumber rolls they've had to endure over the years. Sushi supreme has plenty of selection on their menu, even if you do or don't eat fish/meat. I saw their glee over finally having menu options and it warmed my cold heart.

I ordered a bowl of tempura udon: a large bowl of udon in a savory broth with two tempura shrimp and a mix of tempura veggies. It was the perfect amount of food. Delicious, filling, and not greasy for less than $10.00. 

Extra star for their patient service. At the table next to us, there was a lady that was being extremely picky about her order, I witnessed her spend 10 minutes interrogating the waiter. The waiter had the chefs make something specific for her tastes (maki had to have the rice on the outside, only specific ingredients, etc.). Only to finally have her send the dish back because the seaweed was too tough. The seaweed for all our dishes had no problem, we ate our maki/rolls/sushi with no problem. The waiter was patient, kept a smile and never got frustrated with her. Good job on service!!"}
{"text":"I am not a Sushi fan but when I want Sushi, I go to Sushi Supreme. My friends prefer it too.

I like their Bento Boxes. But Please try their appetizers one by one. Good. 

Lots of seating space, good food, reasonably priced.....A lot of evenings have been spent at this place with friends."}
{"text":"Its good...

The rolls are ridiculously affordable. Like very reasonable. The rolls are twice the size of normal ones too which is great and they come usually in pieces of 8. So for 8 dollars you get 16 pieces of maki which is awesome! 
Just don't expect it to knock your socks off, this is a great weeknight hubby and wife restaurant and the servers are nice, quiet but nice:)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Definitely my favourite sushi place in this area. Owners are nice, sushi's got good portioning and delivery is free ! Rice to fish ratio on the maki is perfect. Great value for you money."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and this place is decent. The deluxe Bento box is a great value: chicken, rice, veggie tempura, salad, soup and a couple different types of rolls. Enough for two meals! Sushi is of course not the best or the freshest I've ever had but I'm okay with that. Service is attentive, efficient and kind. Lastly, they give you a cute cut up orange at the end of your meal. Will definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I could not resist the 18-piece veggie tempura dinner with soup and salad for six bucks! Tempura is my major culinary weakness.

The tempura has a nice mix of veggies -- mushroom, sweet potato, zucchini, Japanese eggplant, and broccoli -- without any of the filler veggies that I never want. I can't decide which is the best piece to save for last. :) They're a little sparse on the batter as if it were a bit too watery. 

The place is really warm and comfortable and not pretentious. It looks like a bar, with all the fixtures and wood and metal, and they're playing classic rock/pop in the background. The art hanging on the walls consists of random Japanese tchotchkes, but otherwise it just looks like a bar (a clean shiney well-kept bar, not a dive at all!). It's a fairly small place, and I don't think there was a table with more than four seats, so don't take a big group. It's not accessible as there's a step up to get in and the washrooms are upstairs.

I'll call this 3.5 stars for now. I got takeout, so I'm sure I'll be adding another star once I get to try the sushi and/or eat in the restaurant (so that the food is fresher than if it had just had a ten-minute ride in my bike basket).

Edit 21 Feb 2011: how can this sushi be so good and so cheap? There must be a catch. Just veggie rolls, of course, but they're very flavourful and stuffed to the gills. The wakame panko maki is an oddity but very tasty. A whole other star just for these rolls and the speed of delivery.  Damn, these things are addictive. I appreciate restaurants that get experimental with veggie maki. A big mouthful of slippery wakame and crunchy panko... I love it until I have to start flossing bits of seaweed fibre out of my teeth. But that goes with the territory of being a seaweed salad junkie.

Okay, I'm right around the corner from them and I still had to order $20 of stuff to get delivery (too cold to walk, shuddup) but it's worth it. I'll probably save the veggie udon for breakfast because the rolls are just so satisfying. $20 plus tax and tip got me two big stuffed veggie rolls, plus veggie udon, plus 18 pieces of tempura and miso soup and salad."}
{"text":"It is just okay... Maybe 2.5 - 3 stars.

This place use to be the best in mid-town back in the days - I was here 10 years ago.   
 
10 years fast forward - the decor still looks the same.   What I use to portray as a happening place is not what it once use to be.   The walls has newspaper articles saying, Susur has dined at the BEST Japanese restaurant, but that was back in 2007?   Stickers on the front window saying best of 2002, 2004, etc and I think it stopped at 06? That was all sooo long ago.   I just feel this place just did not grow with the urbanization of Toronto.  A certain sad nostalgia depicting what it used to be but no more.  With new delish sushi joints opening up all over Toronto - compared to them, this place is just subpar.   The ingredients used are nothing special - ie: they use imitation crap meat in ALMOST all the roles.   I couldn't differentiate the rainbow roll from a california roll - except yes, the rainbow has the sliced sashimi on top.  The cucumber salad was again, filled with avocados, imitation crab, and cucumbers, without the rice - same base as rainbow, and California roll.  So, I felt like I ate California roll 3x in three different presentations.   

Sigh...  Sushi Supreme no more.  It's priced cheaply and I guess that's an attraction.  But, I don't think I'll be coming back if I had a choice."}
{"text":"3.5 stars based on 12+ visits & 3 take out orders.

In a neighbourhood with plenty of Japanese restaurants not run by Japanese people, this is my go-to place for consistent, solid food.

Favourites include the very reasonably priced sunomono dinner, the somewhat hard to find elsewhere shitake mushroom tempura, and the eggplant tempura, which is great value as well as not greasey!

Sushi is not spectacular, but also never bad.  Staff is nice and accomodating.  They are open until 11pm during the week, later than most in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"On a day that I decide that a girl's gotta have some carbs, I head over to Sushi Supreme for balance.  Why you ask?  Because if I can't save carbs, I may as well save money.

Sushi Supreme is a practical sushi restaurant in The yuppy-filled Yonge and Davisville area which offers good sushi and hearty bento boxes for an excellent price.  The restaurant is not much to look at and the customers are banged in and out over the course of the day but the value of the meal you are served is tremendous.  
Sushi Supreme is the perfect Wednesday night , I just went to the gym and I'm too starving to cook restaurant, but if you want a dragged out, dining experience head elsewhere fast."}
{"text":"This review is more directly based upon my delivery service. After seeing the 4 star rating I was excited to try a new sushi joint -- that would also deliver to my door. After the hour and 15 minute wait, I had to call to make sure my order was still even coming. The lady on the phone was very short and not very friendly, nor did she apologize for the fact my order still hadn't been sent yet. Any roll described as crispy was spongey. Any roll that was to be warm, was cold and tasteless. No discount, no compromise or compensation. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My Hot-Spot for lunch!
Absolutey love this place - Sushi in my opinion is great and the service is fast, so you are in and outta there if you have a short lunch break.

My usual poison is the Sushi Bronze.
It gives you a little bit of everything.  Cucumber roll, Salmon roll and 5 pieces of assorted Sushi plus a salmon hand roll for $11.30 with tax.
Im not a fan of avocado so that is what I usually get unless Im craving a Bento Box.
Lunch specials go for $6.99 - 7.99."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Sushi restaurants in Toronto (another one is Sushi Rock). They have the most delicious sushi, also vegetarian options that are so good! I love their Miso soup that comes with food, and my favorite is Mango-Avocado salad that has delicious dressing. This salad is loaded with mangos and avocado, not like other places where I have had few pieces of each. I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened over 12 years ago and have had few disappointments. Generally i get the Chicken teriaki dinner which for $9 will leave you stuffed but have ventured into most of their menu items over the years. Pretty impressive when the bill comes and its less than $25 for two. They have been consistent over the years and keep delivering good value and taste."}
{"text":"Yummy, fresh, casual, reasonable prices, in my hood and just discovered, will go back!"}
{"text":"This little hub was a nice lunch experience that cost me $6.95 for an assortment of five rolls that included Avocado, which, despite being \"mushy\" and falling apart were nonetheless tasty. These were flanked by Spicy Salmon/ Tuna rolls which were, in my eyes a misnomer and again not spicy enough to my experienced South Asian buds. Service was average."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Davisville to Eglinton area.

My go to sushi place.

Great price, fresh fish, large portion, friendly service, and a nice and casual environment.

What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is my go-to cheap sushi place!  I have had better sushi, but I could not ask for better sushi for this price a short walk away from my apartment.

They're also really great about gluten content.  I usually bring my own soy sauce with me to sushi restaurants and have to be careful about what I order.  Sushi Supreme has gluten-free soy sauce on request and although not all of their employees can speak to the whole menu, I have had someone go through every single item that I can't eat with me to make sure it's a safe dining experience.  Pretty great!

The portions are plentiful, especially the veggie tempura!  I usually like to order a few sets of 2 sushi pieces of my choice - although if you're less picky than me, the combos are cheaper - and I'm always impressed with quality of the fish, the ratio of fish to rice, and the portions in general."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian!!

So all I want to say is that they have excellent vegetarian options at an excellent price!  That is all."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place. Great sushi and great quanitites! We always order our catered sushi food from here. I love the small little location up at Davisville. Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Good food your buck! 
Got the supreme bento box $10 and it came with alot of food that I was stuffed silly. Service is fast and food is pretty good, especially for how cheap it is! 

There's an upstairs with more tables so don't be sad if it looks busy downstairs!

Tea is free, just FYI

Oh and a nice treat is complimentary oranges for dessert. Nice touch ;)"}
{"text":"If your tummy starts a rumblin' while you're taking a stroll down Yonge past Wellesley with only a few bucks in your pocket, the \"$5.99 LUNCH SPECIAL\" sign might just draw you in like a mesmerized moth to the light. At least, that is what happened to me one sunny afternoon last week. 

Although the restaurant itself was surprisingly deep, brightly lit, well air conditioned, and high ceilinged and the service genuine and quick, the food wasn't thaaat special. But hey, it was $5.99! I've paid a lot more for a lot less - quality and quantity-wise. The salad dressing was a little too creamy to be appetizing and the miso soup a tad bland, but for a dollar less than the lunch special at the cheapo sushi joint just down the street, the two beautifully plated rolls - I went with the Sky Dome and Avocado combo - were a treat.

After requesting that I be able to keep the a la carte menu to peruse during my meal, I delighted in the colourful photos and descriptions that were to be tough choices for less frugal future meals and couldn't wait to be back.

I'm happy to be able to report now that dinner at Sushi Supreme is not only still great bang for your buck, but even more tasty. The refreshingly riceless cucumber wrapped salad roll ($6) comes with a whopping eight pieces; the ikayaki ($5.50) is an entire juicy grilled squid complete with body and tentacled legs sliced up, served with a sweet and smokey soy dip; and the vegetable tempura ($3) is nine pieces of delicate and flavourful crispiness.    

Once again, the service was tops. Water (served with lemon slices) was constantly refilled without beckoning. When this guy in the booth behind me had a severe case of the sneezies (picture fifteen consecutive snotful explosions at two second intervals), the server discretely brought over a box of tissues and offered her sincere \"bless you's\". How sweet!"}
{"text":"Location 5/5- near eglinton station
Price : 5/5 - $48 for 60 pieces
Service: 5/5- very nice
Food: 4/5- sashimi was fresh, but could work on the rice

For a small chinese sushi place, sushi supreme is definitely in the top bracket compared to other ones i've tried. The sashimi was most definitely fresh and the maki had generous chunks of fish inside. The avocado used in the rolls were creamy and not brown which is great.  ohh there's free wifi!

Our group order the silver party platter which is enough food to make 3 people super bloated. The meal came with salad and miso soup, unfortunately no ice cream. The dine-in price for the platter is more expensive than take out for some reason.  

My only complaints were for the sushi rice.... the rice was extremely salty and thick. At first I thought i put on too much soy sauce, but it was actually the rice itself. Also i didn't think the oil used to fry the tempura were fresh either. 

However, the friendly chinese lady who runs this place didn't kick us out after over staying past closing time and the waitress - her daughter?? was really great too!

i will come back next time i'm in this area."}
{"text":"Came to Sushi Supreme after searching for a decent dinner place close to the Canon Theatre before Billy Elliot.  Sushi Supreme is about a 10-15 min. walk to the theatre, depending on how fast you walk.

First impressions was that the space was pretty big for a Yonge Street restaurant.  It was still early so the place was pretty empty.  There was a mix of large tables and booths so plenty of seating was available.

Our group of five ordered a variety of rolls to share:

California Roll ($5)
Crunchy Spicy Salmon Roll ($5.50)
Dyno Roll ($5.75)
Supreme Roll ($6.00)
Rainbow Roll ($8.95)
Skydome Roll ($5)
Spicy Tuna Roll ($5)
U.F.O ($6.50)

2 orders of the tempura appetizer ($6) and miso soups ($1.50 x 5).

Food came very fast.  Quality of sushi was good, on par with Sushi on Bloor.  The only thing we questioned was the U.F.O because it wasn't really a roll but just pieces of salmon a top a piece of tempura egg plant.  Not great.  

The meal came with oranges at the end which was a nice touch but did they really have to charge for the miso soup especially since we had such a large order of food? 

Overall, a decent meal and glad we didn't have to eat at any of the chain restaurants in the area.  Probably would only come back if we were in the area again and was craving sushi."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, this place is a good neighbourhood Japanese restaurant. Would I go here if I'm craving quality rolls? Probably not. I'd most likely go to Japango or WOW Sushi. They have really tasty lobster rolls and hand rolls are pretty good too. The bento boxes are a good deal and pretty much all the rolls on the menu are priced $1-$3 dollars below your typical Japanese restaurant. So, in that respect, the quality of food is adequate to fair prices. If you decide to give Sushi Supreme a try, get the lobster rolls and I think you won't regret that decision ;) Otherwise, there's Falasca (Italian), Lil' Baci (Italian too) or Tabule (Middle Eastern) just up the street, which are also solid choices in that neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. I spotted a mango roll on the lunch menu and had to try it out.

Place has nice-ish decor for a cheap sushi joint.

Lunch specials are $6.99. Sushi roll portions are big, similar to Sushi on Bloor or Big Sushi. 

I tried lunch special E which was a mango roll with a bbq salmon roll. I didn't realize the salmon roll would actually be cooked salmon, but it was. It was plain grilled salmon rolled with cucumber, very dry. Didn't like it. The mango roll was good - mango, crab and tobiko. 

The service was really good here, but there was only one other table (we ate close to 4pm so most people were finished eating lunch) so not sure how good they are when the place is packed.

Wouldn't go out of my way to return here, but if you're in the area it's definitely a decent choice for a cheap sushi lunch."}
{"text":"2.5 tops

We picked up some sushi for the night. 
Tried their fried calamari, crunchy spicy salmon roll (6 pieces) and green dragon roll (8 pieces). 

Calamari- $5.50

Salmon roll- $5.50

Dragon roll- $7.95

FOOD itself was meh, nothing exceptional I'm afraid. The fried calamari was a bit chewy and the dragon roll had too much cucumber.

Very reasonable PRICES and it's all fresh, made in front of you. 

But the prep stations and ordering areas were kind of MESSY/dirty. Made my stomach turn a bit. 

Also must have caught them at a BUSY point cause they said it would be a 10 to 15 wait and it was 25. They apologized for the wait which goes a long way. 


I RECOMMEND- the crunchy spicy salmon roll

EXTRA TIP- if you're in the area, consider ordering for delivery (free with $20 min order before tax) cause its chaotic and small in the actual venue"}
{"text":"My favourite midtown sushi place! The food is so delicious and you get so much food for what you pay! Anytime I order salmon teriyaki it seems like I got 3 pieces for the price of one. And the servers are friendly as well. My one criticism is with their spicy salmon rolls. I love salmon and the spicy is usually my go to anywhere else, but for some reason theirs just has some off taste. Aside from that, go to sushi supreme and it will knock your socks off!!!!"}
{"text":"Typical Yonge St sushi fare, what can I say? We get the crunchy spicy roll set all the time and it always tastes decent and is pretty cheap for what you get. The salad and miso soup are decent as well."}
{"text":"We found this place randomly when looking for a gluten free friendly sushi restaurant. They're pretty knowledgable about gluten free and I didn't get sick! The rolls were some of the best I've tried to date! 

I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place in the last 2 years.  They have good prices and the service is quick.
Tonight, my friend and I had our craving and went to our go to place.  

Everything was expected until we had a visitor stop by.  It was a RAT that ran across the dining area.  I thought I was seeing things and I asked my friend to look - she confirmed and we both screamed.  The rat was a size of a shoe - we had lifted our feet up away from the ground.  

The servers heard our screams and came to inspect but the RAT had already escaped.  We were terrified and disgusted - dessert was brought to us but we had to leave pronto.  We paid and left.

I can NEVER go there again.  And it disappoints me as all our many visits to this place was great.  But a RAT the size of Splinter is NOT ACCEPTABLE.

I have been left with no choice to retract my previous reviews and lower the rating.  Tonight is the last EVER I will be dining at this place."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner at Sushi Supreme on a Tuesday night. 

Tip: DO NOT DRIVE HERE. Parking is located on side streets, and these streets are jammed packed. We spent about 15 minutes alone just trying to find parking!
Atmosphere : The ambience is very laid back with somewhat dim lighting. It looks very clean and it had some business going on at the time. There is light background music but you can hear whatever the person across from you is saying.

Food:  We quickly received Miso soup when we placed our order. Quickly after that we had a small house salad. The dressing was plopped right on top. The dressing had a great flavour to it, but it felt like the salad was sitting in a refrigerator. The lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers were freezing. The main dish - Chicken Teriyaki and the rolls - green dragon roll, sky dome roll and yonge street road came out fairly quickly. It took about 10 minutes after we ordered to get all our food. The teriyaki chicken had a large amount of bean sprouts and a few veggies (about 3 pieces of broccoli, sliced zucchini, some onions and some carrots). There wasn't enough teriyaki sauce to even cover all the chicken sauces. The rolls were extremely fresh. As someone who doesn't like dipping their sushi in soya sauce, I asked for tempura sauce and the server gave me a surprised glance but brought it out anyways. To finish off your dinner, they bring you slices of orange which is a nice ending to your meal.

Service : The host and servers are really friendly. I'm used to being greeted by the chefs upon entering the restaurant yelling 'irasshaimase' but they didn't here, which kind of threw me off. However the servers were very attentive and they refilled our water cups without asking.

I would recommend coming here for a laid back atmosphere with good food and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in Toronto- consistently great food at an awesome price point. I always go here and do take-out. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went there 15 min after the posted opening time on Sat. The guy inside looked at me when I tagged at the door and waved me away as if I were a pest or a bother to him!
I went to another sushi place on Mt Pleasant and got  $50 worth of sushi and will NEVER go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best sushi around.  Fresh food, great selection, amazing value and friendly proprietors.  Love this place and have NEVER been disappointed."}
{"text":"Saw great reviews so I was excited to try this place. Close to home and did not involve a delivery service, it looked good.

Food arrived and husband was concerned, he asked the delivery driver if that was all, and he said yes. He came upstairs with one plastic bag and I was surprised by how small, but we were assured our whole order was in bag (it was all tied up so hard to open at the door).

We open it, and sure enough food is missing. We call the restaurant and the woman argues with me and says fine fine I will look into it. Then they send it again.

No apology, no discount. Just another 30 minute wait until we got food. Obviously both were the main food.

Overall, food was mediocre at best. Yonge Sushi has been more reliable in this area, and we wished we stuck with that.

Nothing tasted great, a few things were very bland. Eggplant tempura roll tasted like rubber.

In a neighbourhood filled with food options, find a better one. This is subpar at best."}
