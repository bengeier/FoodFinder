{"text":"My boyfriend doesn't like to go downtown to eat. (Yeah, I know!?), so when I want oysters, we go here. Only problem is they normally only have one or two kinds. I think having a sign that says \"Oyster Bar\" is a bit misleading.  That being said, we love the food here and go quite often. He normally gets the Coconut Shrimp, and I've tried just about everything. You know a place is good when you keep going back, and take friends there, and we do.  Casual place, we go early and have never needed reservations, as it has a bar side and restaurant side. We normally eat on the bar side.  Make sure to save room for the Peanut Butter Pie, it's divine!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place and not off to a good start! We ordered the Oyster Rockefeller, which usually only appears on high end menus and I really like Oysters Rockefeller when they are cooked right. It was just awful. It looks like mashed green peas on the shell, not at all appetizing. The flavour was worse. It has jalapeno in it, which is not the correct spice at all for this dish. I was sorry I didnt read the description more closely to make sure it would be a classic Oysters Rockefeller, not a concoction of their own. I am glad we only ordered the one dish of 4 oysters and not any more of them.   For the main dish I ordered the halibut with an almond crust. It was just ok, not special though in any way. It certainly tasted fresh enough and firm, but the flavour is too subtle. The rice and veggies on the side were cooked well enough- the rice was not sticky or overcooked and the veggies were not soggy either. My partner's halibut fish and chops though were a bit disappointing though because we prefer the fish and chips at High Street in Toronto. Nothing wrong with this one but the coating is different than the other one-I like the flavour and consistency of HIgh Street better.   The main reason I liked the place is that so few places have more than one or 2 fish dishes. If you want to have a selection, this place does and they told us they can prepare the fish however you want. So that is a big plus. One person in our party had some dietary issues and they told us they could accommodate her. So maybe we will give them one more chance on another occasion."}
{"text":"Great casual restaurant! Efficient service and the food arrives promptly. $1 oysters ftw!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Its nothing obvious here that makes me want to steer clear. I bet some of the dishes are divine even, and I can see how it might become a nice spot to have work lunches at.  But when two members of your party have mild shrimp allergies, and therefore order dishes that clearly don't have shrimp listed in their ingredients on the menu... and the food is brought out, and it very clearly DOES have shrimp in it... well, menu mistakes for a seafood restaurant is a bit risky.  My rainbow trout was well cooked but a little greasy, and smothered with too many pecans. My sweet potato fries were great though, they were the best part... sigh  Nothing really obvious, just a general sense of unease about this place. I hate it when the side is the best part of my meal. I'll go back if my boss wants to, but probably not on my own."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Our waiter was exceptional! Very attentive, brought food out fast, even gave us 5 pieces of a dish (we were a group of 5) when the dish was supposed to come with 4. What really touched us was that he brought out a bday brownie for the birthday man without even being asked to do so! Just incredible.   We went on a Sunday and found out it was happy hour all night. Smoked salmon $6, clam chowder $6, oyster Rockefeller $10, 4-5 pcs, fresh oysters $2... There is a great selection to choose from. I would definetly recommend checking this place out on a Sunday night.   We sat in the dining area, it had a homey feel-like the inside of a Harbor, nice touch.  Go try it out!"}
{"text":"Artic Char, sweet potato fries, and steamed vegetables hit the spot. Slow; late on a Monday night so service was great. Convenient to my hotel, this is definitely a place I will visit again!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great.  Cornbread is delicious and really enjoyed the shrimp/scallop main.  Seafood was very fresh.  My friend gave 2 thumbs up to the jambalaya."}
{"text":"First time here, but not recommend anyone come. The service was not very well, our server was already disappeared. The food taste like fast food restaurant. Their kitchen ventilator is not working very well, so you feel very oily smoke inside the restaurant seating area."}
{"text":"Good service and reasonable prices for a special occasion out. I recommend the surf and turf!"}
{"text":"5 stars , I'm tellin ya I couldn't find anything negative about our latest visit here this last Saturday.  The service: everyone was friendly and inspired.  In past visits I've seen Lucy herself working the floor.  The appetizers and main course were excellent. The atmosphere, with a live band playing was playing blues rock adding a nice ambiance to the place. and the value was just right.  Portions: when  I go to any seafood restaurant I usually expect to walk out hungry, but not the case here.  I was tempted to ask the waitress for a wheelchair when we left,  Don't be put off that Lucy's in Millcreek is in a stripmall  in suburban Toronto (Mississauga),  Remember that the best restaurants are always off the beaten trail and this has always been our \"go to\" restaurant when my wife and I can't decide on the thousands of restaurants in the area.  It was a nice bonus that the windows at the front of the restaurant were completely rolled back giving an outdoor feeling in the restaurant on a nice night.  the coconut shrimp has always been my favorite here, the PEI mussels were in an amazing chipotle tomato sauce.  My main course was a nice marlin steak, crispy grilled vegetables and sweet potato fries.  Had that with a few cold beers and I was I  heaven.   Dessert I had the peanut butter pie .  I realize 5 stars puts a big expectation on you if decide to go, but i truly believe these folks are passionate about running a restaurant,"}
{"text":"Been coming here for just two years, but I go twice a month or more. Great food. Love the bar. And the people are good, too."}
{"text":"I used to love lucys. Until recently it switched owners. Quality slid down hill very fast. I have tried it 3 times since new ownership. Tuesdays was my favourite night to go wing night. The first visit the wings were changed, although they \"looked\" bigger, there was less meat, more veins, battered.... and dry. My fried were undercooked, cold,oily and soggy. As for the mousse cake it tasted as if they tried to use a cheap chocolate ... irmaybe even \"chocolate coating\" it lost its richness and decadant flavour i loved.The second time I went they had changed back to the small, unbattered wings (good decision). However they had changed the BBQ sauce and it was much smokier..... seems they have gone back to a more basic BBQ sauce on my 3rd visit. The wings were getting back to normal by now ...however I had found a hair in my water (men's short hair with grey in it ) ....the only person handling my drink was the bartender who also was the only \"server\" on in the dining room . Then later I found a hair on my wing also short, rather fine, brown, slightly curly or maybe just curled into the sauce.... . Showing the bartender both hairs he replied ,\" I don't see anything but IL take your word for it. \" I then slowly pulled the hair off my wing out of the sticky sure and couldn't even get it off my fingers.... wiped it on a napkin and he took the napkin and never apologized or offered anything taken off the bill ect. He came back about 20 mins later and asked if i wanted him to make him more wings......no I am full. Oh and our popcorn shrimp were still black inside and soggy and we had to send those back to be \"redropped\"..... However I had to give the mousse cake another try because I used to love it , I ordered it to go .( still hasn't offered me anything for all the mistakes) . When I ate the cake at home they had improved the flavour since the new ownership....but still nowhere near the old lucys. Not to mention this. was the absolute worst service I have ever received here. No refills offered. Not coming to check on anything . Long wait times for literally everything . Super unimpressed and not sure if I will return:(. I have seen this bartender do disgusting things over the years and not sure why he is a part of he establishment that they decided to keep. Wash your hands sir!"}
{"text":"We have been to Lucy's many times. Food is always good, service is pretty good as well.   Their specials are great!  We will keep coming back, even though your clothes smell like their kitchen when you leave as it is an open-kitchen concept.  We recommend."}
{"text":"Great menu!  Service was wonderful; server was very helpful. The happy hour menu portions were just the right size for us. The jumped up seafood stir fry was delicious!  We're from the US. Wish there was a Lucy's near where we live!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't good. Dismissive waitress who kept us waiting long time.  It wasn't even busy, it was early bird time.  Food was alright but not special.  Probably would not return."}
{"text":"Neighbourhood favourite I had been here many years ago went back last week and had a nice meal. lots of seafood choices. Great value very reasonable prices and nice big menu. Food is very good. They had their oyster special so we had a dozen oysters and for main course my wife had the lobster and I had the corner joint surf and turf. Our meals came fast tasted really good and the server was amazing. They smoke fish and meats in house. I would definitely go back it's worth the drive. Not many good seafood restaurants in town. This one is very good."}
{"text":"Gross. Food tasted like it was re-heated. Never again.  Really disappointing after reading all the great reviews."}
{"text":"It's not the food that needs help here, I feel like it's the waitstaff-one in particular....we keep getting the same female waitress (she's the only one, I think) every time we go.    The first time she gave us a really hard time with coupons I had found online.  Had I fought her however,  she would have had to take them because there were no rules listed on them.  We would have spent an extra $30 on oysters if she had let us use the coupons.    Second time we had her, she must have been tired-not friendly, never a smile, never a thank you, nothing.  We walked right by her as we left the restaurant and she didn't even look up.  We were the only table there (late aft lunch).    So now we look to see where she's serving...bar or dining room before we decide where to sit.  I guess in a positive way this says that the food is pretty good if we still keep going back!"}
{"text":"Nice dining room, a lot of the grilled fish dishes looked good and the apps were good.   Good beer selection.  Place dropped the ball a couple times on warm white wine and an overdone entree, but was totally apologetic and immediately corrected.  Great sign of a decently managed place.  My one main gripe: my jambalaya was terrible.  I don't know what it was - it was like a bad seafood fra diavlo over white rice.  I mean, maybe not bad if your mom came up with it...but no way was that jambalaya.  Chef needs a trip to New Orleans."}

{"text":"I have lived in the Meadowvale area for 6 years and using the GO station for almost two years - but had no clue such a place existed so close to me.  While looking for good seafood in Mississauga came across this restaurant that is right next to the GO station and close to my home - and read the reviews. Decided to give it a shot despite the rather interesting location for a fish and seafood place. Went there on a Friday night with my gf.  Was very pleased with the experience! Place was packed so having a reservation was a good idea. The place did empty out though around 9PM so reservation needed only if you go before that time.   Service was excellent - fastest service I had in a while, very polite. Started with the deep fried calamari and then we went with our mains - I went with the pecan crusted Northern Ontario rainbow trout, and my gf went with the Icelandic Actic Char filet.   The calamari was disappointing. $9 for a tiny little plate. Could tell that the calamari was made in larger portions and simply kept warm before serving. Kinda soggy, not crispy at all. The spicy mayo was nice though.  Despite the calamari disappointment, the fish was excellent. Both fishes really well made, not overcooked so the flavour was still there. Nice sauces to go with them, not too overpowering so could still taste the fish (this is big for me, as sometimes restaurants use so much sauce that you cannot feel the original fish taste). Solid side of sweet potato fries and veggies. Truly filled me up. Did not even get a chance to have dessert as the main was so good.  The place is far from perfect. It has a dining room that is rather average looking but cozy and tables far apart to have private conversations. There is a lounge next door with drinks and TVs but did not go in there. The drinks list is OK with some decent wines and cocktails.   I give it a 5 start but I wish I could do 4 and a half because it has some small problems. The experience was excellent hence pushed it to 5.  Positives: some of the best fish I had in while. Very fast courteous service and very prompt. Despite being in a packed place the food arrived relatively fast so didn't feel like I had to wait for hours. Nice vibe, nice crowd.   Negatives: calamari was soggy and made a while back. Portion was tiny for $9. The prices are not too friendly, as most fish is $20 give or take and the pasta/seafood starts at $17. Throw some wine with this and a dinner for two can push towards $100 with taxes, tip and everything. These are more downtown prices rather than your local Mississauga establishment.   Despite the negatives, I still give this place 5 stars because at the end of the day had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"First of all, be warned that the menu you find in the restaurant is not the menu you'll find online. If you're like me and you plan out exactly what you'll order ahead of time by consulting the menu online, this is very frustrating and disappointing. Restaurants, please keep your online menu updated. It's false advertising, yo!   Secondly if you're like me and don't eat seafood but got dragged here by seafood eating buddies, be warned that your options are very limited. Very limited. You can order steak or your can order chicken. That is it. Two dishes. I suppose you could make a meal of a couple of the appetizers that don't have seafood (chicken wings or pulled pork nachos). I was planning on ordering the burger, but the burger was removed from the menu. And it's still listed online! Damn, burger frustrations! The chicken dish, also, is different than the one listed online.  Beyond the menu change issue, this dining experience was just not stellar. The restaurant has an overall patina of unkempt. Slightly dirty, slightly disheveled. This is not this restaurant's heyday, I can tell you that. It needs a massive renovation to look fresh and appealing. I had to sweep crumbs of food off the booth seat where we were seated. And the paper menus were all creased and grimy.   The cornbread that they brought to our table was just dry and perhaps stale. It was unpleasant. I will say that my steak was a nicely cooked (for the most part) medium rare, but the chef is quite heavy-handed with the salt shaker. Everything on my plate was overly salted.   The fries were those really thin shoestring fries. Argh! Some people must like those fries or the restaurants wouldn't keep serving them, but I've never met any of those freaks of nature. Shoestring fries are not good. They are not good! Sorry to rant, but I hate having those poor excuses for fries foisted on me when any other cut of fry would be better. Medium-thick, steakhouse, heck even waffle-cut would be better than shoestring. Shoestring fries get cold and overly crispy until they resemble those potato stix chip products. I know I sound like a really petulant five year old, but I do not like them!"}
{"text":"Good seafood, run down setting. Feels like an old bar. I had clam chowder, oysters, and spicy breaded shrimp. All were tasty, but the place was surprisingly empty for a Friday at lunch time."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first about the restaurant considering it is in a strip but the food was amazing. The crab cakes are too die for! Especially the lobster crab cakes!  If you are big oyster fan you will also love their oysters, they are like butter!   The decor has a New Orleans feel to it, which  is suiting for some of the menu items."}
{"text":"Beware of this restaurant. My Family  and I had dinner there a few weeks ago.  We had a party of six in total. The food made every single one of us really sick. When we went to use the washroom, they had a wrench on the counter in order to turn the water on and off. That should have been our first clue. Never returning to this restaurant again. This is definitely not the same ownership as the original Lucy's."}
{"text":"Love love love!  Can't stop me from coming back weekly. Never had shrimp so perfectly cooked, fast friendly service.  Literally love coming here with my fiancé"}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews I had high hopes for Lucy's. When I asked if they were gluten-free (GF) friendly I was told that the owner is celiac. So far, so good. I ordered the wild Florida Marlin and a GF beer. 15 minutes later my server came back to tell me that my order wasn't GF after all because it was marinated in soy sauce.   So I changed my order to the wild Atlantic halibut. About 10 minutes later it arrived and the presentation was strange, with the fish broken up into 3 pieces and hidden on a pile of rice.   The fish was badly overcooked and was like eating rubber. Since I was already there for a long time, I decided it was best to grin and bear it, pay, and leave. As compensation for steering me wrong the first time they charged me the lower price of my first selection instead of the higher price of my second selection, so they get a bonus star for that."}
{"text":"The fish and chips are delicious, particularly in the summer when the truck offers it for takeaway. Dining in the restaurant is good and I love the cornbread. My typical order is coconut shrimp and a seafood pasta. I've tried most things on the menu except for the steak. I can't recall specific details for each entree, but it's a restaurant I return to with my family.  We are always satisfied afterwards with leftovers too."}
{"text":"I have been going to Lucy's for many years,  and now that its just up the street from my house I couldn't be happier.   We always go for their happy hour menu,  and I very rarely stray from my all time favourite pulled pork nacho's.   I've only been dissapointed once, as they were slightly over cooked and didn't have a lot of toppings, but that seemed to be just a bad day.   Usually the nacho's are piled high with cheese and pulled pork, very yummy.   My boyfriend recommends the gumbo.  And the popcorn shrimp are good too.   The portions are very reasonable, and the price for  the happy hour menu is amazing.   We recently tried the cajun crab dip, it was quite nice as well,  just spicy enough to be enjoyable.    My one complaint is that they have discontinnued thier $5 martini's on Friday nights,   I'll have to go Mondays instead.   As far as the service goes,  it can be a little slow when its busy,  but the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"If you like seafood that doesn't taste like anything, but costs lots, go here. I think people go here for a drink, to meet up, to hang out. I don't think anyone really goes here for the food.   If you want great seafood, go two doors down to Aristotle Steak and Seafood..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years - since they had their second location on Dundas. I really loved this location when they did the renovation. It looked trendy, modern and always had a line up. It seems those days are gone and the last few times I have been, it hasn't been that busy and the decor hasn't changed in years. They constantly used to update their huge chalk boards with specials, but now it always says the same thing. Their selection of fish used to change often as well as their menu giving this restaurant an element of surprise at every visit, but I noticed that the menu hasn't changed at all in the last two years. Makes me a little sad, I would hate to see the end of an era.  The service is always fantastic. The same wait staff have been there for years and they are always friendly from one visit to the next. The owners are always there as well. They typically seat the guests and consistently watch over the cooks and the wait staff throughout the evening.   The jalapeno corn bread is always my favourite. I always end up having to ask for a second plate. It is always fresh and has a really great flavour that isn't spicy at all.  I started off with the oysters. I thought they were fantastic. Very fresh! There wasn't anything extraordinary about them, but good oysters shouldn't need much to have them taste good. This was definitely the case. Don't mess with a good thing! We also had the bacon wrapped scallops. The scallops were overcooked and didn't have much flavour, but the bacon was great!  I had the Mediterranean salad. It was really good! I have a shrimp allergy, so they had no problem adding extra scallops instead. They gave me my choice of what I wanted at no additional charge which I thought was really great and accommodating. I love the pairing of the feta cheese and pine nuts. Gave it a really nice flavour. The dressing is a raspberry vinaigrette. The only thing I didn't like was the tomato was chopped up extremely small almost mush, like what they would use for a fresh pasta sauce, so I felt like it had been prepped ahead of time and used for multiple things as opposed to having tomato freshly sliced for the salads specifically. The seafood was grilled to perfection - not chewy at all. I did have one scallop that tasted like I bit down into sand that I had to put into my napkin. It was a bit of a turnoff, but I'm not sure that is something they can control as it didn't appear to look any different from the other scallops. I have gotten this salad many times before and will continue to get it. It is one of my favourite items on the menu.   It happened to be my birthday, so they brought me a brownie complete with whipped cream and a candle. It was delicious and a really nice touch.   If you sign up for their newsletter, every year they mail you a free dinner coupon on your birthday. Love this. Use mine every year. The bill still comes out to be quite pricey once you add on the other guest's meals, appetizers, drinks, etc. This is definitely not a cheap restaurant to go to.   Honestly, if it wasn't for the birthday coupon, I'm not sure I would make the drive from Oakville to Lucy's any longer, but when I do go, I enjoy it. They need to switch up their menu and pay a little more attention to presentation and quality of the small things like the steamed vegetables (clearly from a frozen package and then steamed) and scallops they use."}
{"text":"Caved in today and so glad that I did. Lucy never disappoints. Corn bread is always a plus, but today it was fresh and perfection paired with my Almond crusted Alaskan halibut. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but nothing special.  The atmosphere is really friendly and welcoming, and the place fills up quickly on a Friday night, but the food really wasn't that great.  My friend ordered the crab cakes, which she said were mushy on the inside, and weren't crispy at all, probably due to the creamy gravy on top.  Personally, I would have set the cakes on the gravy so you could have the crunch, but that's just me. Tastewise, she gave it a \"meh\".  I ordered the pickerel, which came a little dry and overcooked and erratically seasoned. Some parts of the fish were bland as hell, and others had a big dollop of lemon pepper seasoning (you know, the kind you buy in the store) on it. The vegetables that came with it were a little too raw for my liking and were basically just a big chunk of carrot and broccoli roughly 1\" x 5\", no joke. If they were going to leave them so big, they should have cooked them softer so I wouldn't be trying to saw through them with my butter knife.  My friend had the stuffed sole, which she said was pretty good, but again, nothing special.  Service was fine, she was really great at refilling our waters and was really hustling since she had a full section. The food came out at a good clip, and we didn't feel rushed or neglected.   Both of us left pretty underwhelmed. Our mains were about $18 each, which seemed pretty pricey considering the quality wasn't so great.  It seemed like a comfy place to have a drink and eat some oysters (they have an oyster special on Thursday), but it's not somewhere we'll be returning to."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of this place 6-7 years ago. Since that time I have moved to Toronto. Now that I'm working in Mississauga again I have a chance to try this place again. They seemed to have changed owners. The place has been renovated too.  Our table ordered a bunch of fish and chips, and I had the seafood pasta. Frankly I can make better pasta than this chef. He either added too much wine and/or didn't reduce the wine down. The sauce lacked \"cream sauce\" taste. I can taste the wine, meaning the cook didn't add enough cream.  Service is never a factor to me. But based on food alone, if you can screw up cream pasta, I don't know what to say. My companions said the fish and chips was ok. It's hard to screw up fish and chips I guess. We also ordered coconut shrimp and calamri. Both were ok!  In terms of value, I know seafood is not cheap. Their prices are not terrible. My dish had a decent amount of seafood in it. If you work in the are and want value, you can find better options by eating other foods, but this is not the fault of the restaurant. However, it would be nice if they create some lunch specials to attract the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Always loved this place...  although the one they had down at Bristol and McLaughlin closed down, I still drive all the way up there to get my oyster fix.  They should open up another one down near Square One area again."}
{"text":"Lively New Orleans-themed atmosphere. Came on a Friday evening and it was packed, definitely best to make reservations. Both dining side and bar side of restaurant were full.  They gave free jalapeno cornbread with butter. Tasty with zing but would have preferred this to be warm and softer.  Ordered \"Lucy's Sumptuous Seafood Platter For Two\" which was a Groupon $34ish find. Came with 1 lobster, 4 Alaskan King Crab Legs, 4 bacon-wrapped scallop, steamed veggies and two sides (fries/potato/rice, etc).  These were okay. Lobster was covered in gravy (I think I just prefer fresh and clean taste of boiled), crab legs were tasty however shells were super soft and spikey than usual so hard to crack open, scallops were large and generous but overcooked.   We also ordered:  - Home-made New England Cream Clam Chowder ($4.95 for a big cup). This was fairly good - liked that it wasn't overly salty. Could have had more \"bits\" in it though, was more creamy than anything. -Rockefeller Oyster ($8.95 for 4 oysters): \"New Orleans Style\" oysters cooked with Pernod, spinach, jalepeno and parmesan. My first time trying these anywhere. Nice flavour/texture with kick. I prefer my oysters raw but did enjoy trying these. -Delta Blue Crab Cakes (2 for $8.85): quite chewy but tasty. Not a crab cake fan generally though. -Sweet Potato Pecan Pie - just something I had to try once - didn't like it at all but I'm glad I tried it. -Peanut Butter Chocolate Mousse dessert - deelish creamy goodness  By evening's end dining area had quieted out but the bar was rocking some karaoke - lively and fun, not the annoying kind (perhaps I lucked out with hearing good singers).  Great for a casual night out. There are different daily specials as well on a large chalkboard (ie/Thursday night pulled pork nachos, etc). Though it's great for families I'm thinking (at least on a Friday night) not the best for young kids. More of a...order a few drinks, be lively and munch on fatty foods type place. I suspect it would be very different in the day for lunch.    Good variety of seafood available however I don't think it does justice to lovely fresh seafood (I like my seafood cooked just so, so it's just cooked but juicy, tender, not bouncy or chewy).   Would I come back? Probably. But I'd order something more basic. The people next to me ordered fish and chips, that looked GREAT."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves absolutely delicious food. It has been a favourite spot of mine since I was introduced to it a year ago. The batter of the fish and chips is thick and crisp, exactly what I look for. I love everything about this place. Highly recommended to everyone."}
{"text":"Really excited to bring my mom here to treat her to some oysters on buck a shuck night.   I'm really disappointed in the food quality and presentation. I ordered 5 different items and there was nothing worth remembering. Although I remember the shell chips and dirt in my oysters...  Service was good. The waitress was a pretty Asian girl who always checked up on us to make sure things were good and cleared our table often since we ordered plenty but the table space was limited.   Maybe this place is good for a drink at the bar but wouldn't suggest this place for food."}
{"text":"Amazing fish and chips, very big portion of fish and fries. Chipotle chicken and shrimp pasta was amazing too! So many things on the menu I want to try. The atmosphere was amazing and the restaurant is big to fit a lot of people. I will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for many times over last 10 years. The food is always fresh & delicious. So I can say that the quality is consistent. Will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The oysters are to die for ! Their nachos are my favourite as well , great place with great people :)"}
{"text":"My siblings and i go here often because it's close to the house and they have $1 oyster specials on Thursdays among other great daily specials. This review is an overview of all our visits.   Food The oysters have always been good, whether they are smaller or plumper. This past time was slightly salty, I know it's salt water shell fish but, more so than normal and more like table salt vs. sea salt. The restaurant wasn't interested in doing much about it, so we did quick rinses with our water before squeezing the lemon juice on.  They are currently having $19.95 lobster dinners with 4 different choices on how to eat a 1 lb lobster. We tried the New Orleans style (with old bay seasoning), it was good lobster but the seasoning was slightly lacking. I tried my brother's naked lobster topped with mushroom, shrimp and scallop butter sauce (MUCH BETTER).  Their appetizers have been hit or miss sometimes, nachos was good and cheesy. The mussels were also pretty good, but size was a bit small. the calamari is sometimes crispy and delicious, sometimes chewy and soggy. Their chicken wings are pretty good for a seafood place.   Service They have been consistently friendly and knowledgeable about their specials, food and drinks. With or without reservations, we've always managed to get seated pretty quickly anytime of the week. Sometimes it does take long to find our server, but not to the point of frustration.   Overall, I'd recommend them for their happy hour (after 9pm or from 4-6pm) food specials and daily drinks (Thursday is two pints of Guinness for $9) specials or for special family dinners. Remember to sit at the bar for their late night specials."}
{"text":"This is my go to when it comes to seafood in the burbs.  Let's be honest, really good seafood in Ontario is slim pickins.  Many are \"good\" but really compared to coastal provinces in Canada it is somewhat just mediocre.  It is quite unfortunate.  Now that that is established, as I always do my reviews it is always based in comparison to similar restaurants within the region.     So here goes, we've been going to Lucy's for many many years.  Even back in the day when they had several locations.  Our family was quite disappointed when they closed down the   Bristol location.  Anyway, quite glad to see that the original location remains open.  This is a family restaurant.  Often you will find regulars and they are treated as such.  I should mention that they mostly treat everyone as a regular.  One of the best things about this place.  They have an open kitchen and from since I can remember, the same chef.    I generally order the same things.  I like a clean flavour when it comes to seafood.  I want to taste the fish and not have it drowning in sauces.  I feel that the freshness is more exposed when prepared simply.  Having said that:  my go to shrimp and salmon penne with white wine and garlic sauce.  The deep dried calamari.  The pan fried rainbow trout with white wine and capers on rice. Steamed Mussels in white wine butter sauce.    The commonality is obvious.  I like white wine sauce.  Lol!  If noticed, some of these are not on the menu.  Yes, they are very flexible and will make it your choosing so long as they have the ingredients for it.  I love that.    Quality of the food is always consistent.  The fish/seafood is fresh.  The sauces are good.  If there was any knock I have to make is that their vegetables can be a bit more exciting.  It is steamed broccoli and carrot.  I mean....yeppp not much else with it.  Their fries and sweet potato fries are really good though.  I say I absolutely recommend this local mom and pops seafood spot.  It's a good date spot.  A good family go to.  A good friends get together spot.  I highly recommend making reservations at dinner during the weekends as it does get packed.  And do try their SumSum menu on Sundays (small portions of certain items in their menu at heavily discounted price)."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the new owners and how well they treat their clientelle...they go out of their way to make sure you are greeted and seated in a nice clean table...always walking around checking on things.  Love the music on Friday nights.....makes us keep coming back."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to go for seafood for her birthday so I checked Yelp and found Lucy's nearby. We arrived to a pretty packed house without a reservation. The hostess told it would be about 15 minutes for a table. No problem. Right behind us was another patron that was also looking for a table for two and was told 10-15 minutes. We noticed that it was odd she was quoted a shorter wait than we were as we walked outside to wait. We also realized that the hostess hadn't taken our name so went back in to mention it. On arrival back inside, we saw the lady that had come in after us without a reservation seated at a two-top that was empty just moments before. We told the hostess that we hadn't given her our name and she said she knew and that we were the only ones waiting. I pointed out to her that the woman that had come in after us was seated immediately and that I didn't understand why we were not seated at that table. She said she was waiting for a table in the back to put us at! (PS. my friend is Jamaican) With wide eyes and a dropped jaw, I stood there for a moment unsure of how to react. My friend said, \"let's just go\" but I wasn't okay with that. Just then the hostess said she could seat us and took us to a four-top on the side of the restaurant. We sat down, both incredibly uncomfortable and unsure if we should stay or not but decided to give the place a chance despite our unfortunate first impression.  They have a good-sized menu with a lot of options. Our waiter was friendly and even brought out a slice of chocolate mouse cake (on the house) with a lit candle at the end of the meal.  I ordered the Rainbow Trout with Capers and Lemon Butter and my friend had the Halibut and Chips. We were both satisfied with the taste and presentation of our entrees.  Towards the end of our meal, the band began playing in the bar area. It was really too loud to enjoy a conversation over. Though I should mention that the band was very good. I was impressed and had I gone out to hear a band (rather than to celebrate my friend's birthday and catch up over dinner) I would have been thrilled. Unfortunately, the volume was enough to drive us out.  We both agreed that overall we were satisfied and will probably give Lucy's another chance to wow us."}
{"text":"The portions are large and the food is excellent! The atmosphere was relaxed and the restaurant was very clean. As it has been decent weather, they had the front windows open. I ordered the appetizer coconut shrimp and a cup of clam chowder soup. Also the staff was very attentive even though it was quite busy. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Thursday $1 oyster is the best! Very fresh n affordable. Try the sweet potato fries. Real sweet potato wedge with skin on!"}
{"text":"-4 stars for food, 2 stars for hospitality because of how it started off Things started off very badly with this dining experience, got a bit better, and then the entrees were disappointing. If you want to eat here on a Friday evening, you should definitely make a reservation or head straight to the bar.  We aren't good at meal planning, so we didn't have a reservation. To be fair, this is a humble looking place in a strip mall, though it appears to be very popular. We searched Yelp for something new, and the menu looked good, so we decided to check it out. We called the restaurant from the car to see if they were on a wait and see if we could put our names in. I was told that they were completely full when I called, but that they would put my name down, and after we got there, they'd let us know when a table became available. Once we arrived, the woman at the front, who I think was actually the manager, informed us that there was a 20 minute wait and that it was their policy that someone could not be put on the waiting list until they were physically present in the restaurant. I saw her scratch us off the waiting list, and the person who I spoke with tried to say that we were, in fact, on the waiting list. I said, \"Then how come I just watched her scratch our names off?\" It got a little ugly, as we were so hungry and had driven half an hour to get there. We wanted to leave on principle, but didn't think we could get anywhere else within the quoted 20 minutes, so we decided to go wait in the bar.   She walked us to the bar, and there was one chair at the bar, and at the far end of the bar, a high top table that we were offered to wait at. At this point, I was feeling rather confused. I thought, \"I guess you can't order food at the bar for some reason.\" The server comes over, and come to find out, you can order food at the bar. After all that drama about whether or not we could call ahead for the waiting list and how they were completely full and had no tables, there was a perfectly available bar table!   At this point, we'd decided we didn't want to interact with the person from the front of the house again, and we were perfectly content to remain in the bar. Our server was very friendly, and eventually encouraged us to move to a better bar table.  We ordered the crab cheese dip and the coconut shrimp as appetizers, and both were excellent. The orange marmalade dip for the coconut shrimp had just a hint of spice. We both ordered the lobster rolls for our entree, and did not particularly enjoy them. To be fair, the last time we'd had lobster rolls was in Maine, which led us to want more, and it was hard to compete. However, the style of the dish was completely different, and the menu didn't clearly indicate that it would be served cold. I expected hot lobster chunks between a warm buttery bun, and got a lukewarm bun with cold filling. It tasted rather like chicken salad with lobster instead of chicken.   Things improved again for dessert with delicious bread pudding. Definitely order it if you save room for dessert.   They have some delicious New Orleans style seafood. Recommend making a reservation or just eating in the bar. They also have some nightly specials in the bar not available in the main restaurant.   Overall, we'd be willing to return, despite starting out on the wrong foot. We'll just go straight to the bar for seating."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit. Lucy's exceeded my expectation once again. The quality of food, price and friendliness of staff was great once again."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and hospitable staff!  Went there for dinner while on a work visit and wasn't disappointed!   The restaurant was nicely decorated and comfortable. I ordered the Pickerel with Yukon gold fries and vegetables. The Pickerel was tasty and well-cooked and the dill sauce tasty (although I wish there has been more sauce). The fries were crispy and had good potato flavor. And, while there's not much to say about steamed vegetables, at least these weren't overdone - they retained their color and had a nice crisp-texture.  For dessert, I had the sweet potato pecan pie. This was the only disappointment of the evening as it was grainy and lacked flavor.  The real star, however, was my waitress, Jolanta. She was very friendly, made good suggestions on what to have, and provided the right amount of attentiveness.  I would definitely come back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a value for money vs quality. Pretty much disappointed!!  The ambiance is upper end of average, can get 3.5 star. Service was good and the server was friendly and prompt, can deserve 3.5 star too. But the food gets 1.5 star, at the max 2 star.  We had Nova Scotia Hardshell Lobster, and Cheese Stuffed Squid. Presentation and taste both were below average. The squid was hot (spicy), and the lobster was definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"3 words - PEANUT BUTTER PIE!!! absolute deliciousness:)  cozy, low key type of place....good casual dining feel (like there would be frequent regulars eating at the bar type of place)....service was great. our waitress was super nice & made good recommendations. got our food fairly quickly even though we weren't in a hurry, so that's never a bad thing!  pulled pork poutine: decent tasting. good smoke. poutine is poutine but the pork was not dripping fat like some other places make it so that's a plus!  oysters: DH loved both types on the menu....will def be back for more of those!!  crab cakes: good...flavorful. good portion size. had something tomato in them bc they reminded me of italian food for some reason lol  coconut shrimp: pretty average.  loved the sauce though!  PB pie: do not leave without trying it!!"}
{"text":"We ordered Cajun Crab Dip, Buffalo shrimp and Charred Alaskan Fillet with cucumber pineapple salsa.  Everything was awesome. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"You would think that a seafood restaurant would have fresh, delicious seafood- not here.  The short story is: this place is past it's prime- skip it.  My party ordered a dozen oysters, a seafood pasta, seafood Caesar salad, and the junkyard special. Only the oysters and the coconut shrimp from the junkyard special were edible.  Fresh fish never ever smells fishy. Both the seafood pasta and the seafood Caesar were FISHY, clearly off. We immediately brought this to attention of our server- her response? \"Well, you ordered a SEAFOOD dish, with FISH.\" The service here was consistently, ridiculously condescending. Some of the worst service I have gotten in a really long time.  The decor is dated and the overall restaurant is dirty. There were ants crawling on the bench where we were seated (they had the patio window doors open). Nothing about this meal felt welcoming or satifying."}
{"text":"When you approach this place from the parking lot (lots of parking spaces) you can't help but want to check it out. With the windows removed and the tables sitting right there - you just want to grab a cold beer and look out the window - at least on a really nice day!  The place was clean - not spotless, but clean enough that you don't have to worry about it. They have a fairly large selection on the menu with daily specials too! We ordered two appetizers, which were both fantastic - the fried calimari was perhaps the most tender I've ever had. The coconut shrimp was out, but the replacement shrimp was extra flavorful AND spicy!   I had the shrimp and scallop combo with fries AND gravy - I LOVE gravy on the fries! MY entire meal was excellent and I could tell my colleagues must have chosen well too because they left nothing on their plates!  The value was good and it's surely a place to return to. I do recall going there the last time I was in town too and was equally impressed - though I didn't remember that until I saw the front of the place with the large windows removed.   I would like to see more diet beverages offered, but that's not common anywhere. I would also like to see the appetizers a little bit bigger. Splitting them with three people wasn't too filling at all. To be honest - the appetizers were much smaller then I've had anywhere else. The stars will reflect that issue!"}
{"text":"Ok this place has great food. Sometimes it's hard to get in at lunch. The clam chowder is excellent. I think their prices are comparable to other seafood restaurants."}
{"text":"Have not tried anything here I did not like. On the contrary, my dreams are haunted every night by their bacon wrapped scallops and I often crave the pulled pork nachos (which are HUGE, delicious, and great value for money)  Mini update: The corn bread here is mega dry, borderline inedible. But Lucy's is still a gem!"}
{"text":"My friends went here. They warned us not to go. They said their grease was not hot enough and everything that came out was soaked in grease. Nothing crispy. Also they said nothing tasted fresh.   So we avoided even though it would of been more convenient to eat there."}
{"text":"Really nice seafood restaurant.  Very kind people and the most fresh seafood ever!!! Thank you, Chef!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving any stars at all is because 1) I wanted to write this review, and 2) because the place still deserves a star for great staff, specifically Chris the weekday bartender and the bar-side waitresses (one of the dining-side waitresses, however, felt the need to shuffle us over to the over-crowded bar side today)  New ownership has recently taken over (in the last 4 months or so) and the prices have absolutely sky-rocketed. Prices go up, as with anything, but some of our favorite menu items have literally doubled in the last few months. We were looking forward to trying more of the items on their menu, but at the prices they are now: not a hope in hell.  Moreover, the ambiance has changed considerably. They now have loud (and obnoxiously bad in some cases) bands every Friday; an inadequately configured sound system and bad acoustics are something that should have been sorted out beforehand.   What used to be a nice casual Friday night out with my wife (Vixen T, who previously reviewed this place positively) is now a mess of overpriced drunk noise."}
{"text":"I have seem reviews claiming that this place needs a makeover. I disagree!  The inside has a very hip downtown kind of feel, akin to the feel of a new age restaurant as matter of fact. I was expecting to plain table with plain chairs and plain painted walls but the atmosphere was much better.   The food prices are average for a seafood restaurant, but perhaps a little on the expensive side in this case considering how well/not well the food was seasoned and cooked. I paid $22 (not inc tip) for a 5-6oz piece of catfish that came with some sweet potato fries. It was not anything absolutely spectacular, although midway through the meal I discovered my salsa which livened it up a little.   At my table we also tried the lobster ravioli. The ravioli would definitely be able to hold more filling. When cutting through, it became flat and kind of collapsed upon itself. After opening it back up, we could see a couple pieces of lobster mixed in. For a southern inspired restaurant where heartiness is key, this dish could be more hearty!  I am giving 4 stars because service was great and atmosphere was very nice. The food, judging on the price is more of a 3 star. If prices were about 12% less, it would put it would be more quality for the money."}
{"text":"New owners...even worse service than I previously experienced here, long wait times for food that is actually 25% cheaper at Red Lobster. The 3 strikes and you out rule definitely applies to this restaurant.   For 25 years I have been coming to this place and always sang its praises, then the service levels declined and the original owners sold it. The new ownership team is even worse than the previous ones.  This week I made a reservation online and in the box that indicates special requests, I asked for a simple dessert, that I was willing to pay for to be delivered to our table with a candle on it to cap off a birthday celebration, and to my surprise, this simple request was not even honoured.  Now to the review. Wait times were very long, we ordered a seafood salad, surf and turf main course and a kids lobster meal.  Most restaurants will bring the salad first, but not this place. They served the salad at the same time with the main courses, over cooked my steak (I requested medium rare and got a steak that was well done (I would have returned it, but didnt want to wait another 30 minutes)  For those of you who have patronized this restaurant in the past, you may want to avoid now and save your money. The new owners got rid of a lot of the previous menu selections and daily specials, the food is way over priced and the service is very slow.   It's really sad to see such a great restaurant go down like this..."}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night during the ice storm. Our friend was in from out of town and we wanted to try somewhere new and we all love seafood. We basically ordered a bunch of stuff off the menu and tried a little bit of eachothers food. Of everything I ordered the Mediterranean salad stood out the most and obviously the oysters. My only critique food wise was the squid texture and the escargot was underwhelming . The sauce was underseasoned and flat. The bread they served with it was flimsy. You need a nice crusty bread to dip. The jack daniels shrimp is served in a bowl of sauce with no bread. When I asked if I could get a side of bread (other then the flimsy one or rice) the chef looked extremely annoyed. I just think its a waste of sauce. I'm not going to drink it out of the bowl. Overall the food was good, the waitress was nice and I would go back. Next time I will order the lobster and crab meal it looks good."}
{"text":"Tuesday night.  No crowd.  I had the Jambalaya (spelling?) and they warned me was spicy (which it was!) but excellent.  Almost too much to totally eat.  My friend had the Nova Scotia Scallops; the vegetables were somewhat coolish but the very attentive staff offered to heat them up!  The clam chowder was more of a \"stew\" than the usual creamy presentation but it was a meal in itself and excellent.  The restaurant was accessible; for some reason, no-one checked the facilities.  We shall return!"}
{"text":"I am one that likes it. The scallops wrapped bacon are the best."}
{"text":"This place is a hit every time I go there. Every piece of food on their menu from appetizers to entrees to dessert is amazing!!!! I highly recommend this place if you want great seafood or great dessert."}
{"text":"I'm in town from the Chicago area on business. The hotel front desk recomended Lucy's and an Italian place. I wish I would have gone Italian.   I'm not sure what I expected, but it was not a over lit bar/family restaurant. I ordred the halibut based on a recomendatin from the bar tender. It was lacking in falvr accept for the sauce which was an odd grape and balsamic goo. The vegatabels were steamed well, but were under seasoned.   The window in the front said oyster bar, maybe I should have done oysters."}
{"text":"I used to go to the location in Barrie with my family often years ago and it was always one of my favourite places! Me and my friend tracked down this location even though we got lost for a half hour driving in circles! It was worth it though! Great service! Calamari is Amazing as well as the Coconut Shrimp!  Must Try!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent traveler who relies on Yelp for guidance, so I though I'd better do my part and contribute.  For a single visit, Lucy's did well.  I ordered the trout which was pan seared with a lemon butter and caper sauce.  The fish was excellent and delivered very hot, and was perfectly cooked.  Sweet potato fries were good and plentiful.  The veg was basic steamed and while boring was fresh and not overcooked.  The overall meal portion was more than I could eat.  Service was perfectly attentive, but don't expect great insight into the menu.  Beer selection was fine.  I went for a gluten-free beer on tap and regretted it, but that probably wasn't the bar's fault.    They have daily specials, most of which sounded good, but Wednesday's feature was a steak wrap which didn't seem to match the seafood theme.  What I look for in a seafood joint is fresh fish, cooked well and with a range of decently healthy options.  Lucy's has plenty of choices for me and I'm sure to be back."}
{"text":"This is a local favourite.  Can't believe I haven't wrote a review yet! Not until after dinner there tonight - a friend asked if I had written a review yet... that I realised I hadn't done so. And I've dined here twice this week! (Haha, just happened - was unexpected! But just goes to show that they're this good!)   ATMOSPHERE:     Family-friendly, restaurant. A pretty lively bar - have of the restaurant is a bar and the other half a regular dining room. Open kitchen right in the dining room gives it a nice vibe - seeing the food prepared right before your eyes.  Good place for casual meal, family dinners, or a date.   SERVICE:     Service can range, but our experience tonight - with a party of 16 no less! - was very good. Waters were promptly refilled, and just felt like we were not forgotten just because we were a large party.   PRICE:   Entrées range from $13-$40. Sum-Sum menu (special happy hour) which runs all day on Sundays, range from $5-$10 for smaller portions (like tapas style; totally worth checking out if you like to try everything on the menu but don't have the stomach space).  They have daily specials!  Check their online menu for latest.  Thursdays are quite popular because Oysters are $0.99 each.   FOOD:    They are just always reliable.  Seafood done well. Fish, mussels, oysters - all yums! I really love their pastas - especially the smoked salmon and tiger shrimp penne (which they were sold out of tonight!).  Entrée portions are generous.  I usually am able to pack 1/2 to 1/3 of my plate for next day's lunch.  Oh, and don't forget to have some of the corn bread. It's a cajun restaurant - so it's got a bit of kick. But it's one of the BEST corn bread ever! It's a free starter - so don't let it go to waste!   Fun fact: Instead of mints, they give out lollipops at the end of the meal with your bill.  It's one of the few places where you'll see a table of adults eating suckers. :P  Tip:  If you have an account with Open Table - this restaurant is on their site! So make reservations on Open Table to collect points. :)"}
{"text":"I first went to Lucy's way back in early 90's and was impressed then by the menu choices and their simple and thorough service. My last time there was probably about 7yrs.   Had NYE dinner there Dec'2012 after making early reservations before it got too busy. We had Appletinis & Hurricanes for drinks; crab cakes and jack Daniel shrimps for starters; Florida marlin and seafood stir fry followed by tea.   I had prepped myself for their mouth watering cornbread. It's still good after so long.   Our server Alex was outstanding as a waiter. Offered his recommendations when we asked; showed up at the right times to check on us and was what you'd expect at a much more recognized restaurant.   I had forgotten about Lucy's entirely. I think I'm going to become a regular again. Seafood done well is a passion of my belly."}
