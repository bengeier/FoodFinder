{"text":"I tried their apple donut yesterday at the Mural Street Festival on St.Laurent. It was okay; there wasn't that much filling inside the donut itself. It ended up tasting a bit too plain in my opinion, it was spongey (which I liked). The filling was pretty good. They also offer vanilla, chocolate and plum/cherry donuts. I hoping to try more baked goods at this bakery!"}
{"text":"We tried their donuts during the Mural festival last month. We tried the apple ones. They were 2$ each. The donut itself was plump and fluffy, with a nice sugar coat, but I wished there was more filling (see picture). 
All in all, it tasted good!"}

{"text":"Boo Boo and I stopped by here when there was a street fair in early June. They were selling beignets aka donuts for $2 each. We shared apple and it was amazing. We were too full from Swartz's and a mango 'flower' we each ate from another vendor."}
{"text":"Small cafe. French only. Tasty little donuts. Cherry plum donut is super sweet but also super satisfying."}
{"text":"We came here as it was near the place we stayed. It was ok, there were not any other customers in there which wasn't the best sign.  We had a few different donuts, the apple, the fig and the chocolate. They were ok. We also had a meringue.  

The breads looked great, but we didn't eat a ton.  It does look great inside, the pastries do all look amazing."}
{"text":"Great selection, lovely staff. Amazing creme brûlée that even though it is served in a clay pan, you can take it home and bring back the dish another time."}
