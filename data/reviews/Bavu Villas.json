{"text":"Their chili chicken kothu roti is incredible, it takes the classic dish to a whole new level!"}
{"text":"Very good selection of dishes and the spice id used very well, favourite dish with be the kothu roti, huge portion and will come back again!!"}
{"text":"Owner was very polite. This joint is VERY clean and food portion size is big.  A bit spicy so ask for not spicy if you can't handle it!  Will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is great. One small table, take out recommended. Recently renovated. 3 giant flat screens show the food prices but never actually show the items you want to order. So I ordered the a Mutton Kothu Roti and one of their Mutton rolls and prayed that the total wouldn't be $20 for fried roti and bread roll.

Total was much less (phew) and the food was flavourful, dense and delicious. Very carby. Very satisfied.

 To complete the meal I'd probably have a salad or maybe a head of lettuce."}
{"text":"My go to place for kothu roti. I have been here many times and each time they do not fail to amaze me. The flavors are always spot on. If you like spicy food as much as i do, this is a must try. 

I usually get the beef or lamb kothu roti be ause a feel the chicken is a bit dry but still good.

Employees are friendly. This location mostly for take out but there is one table and 2 chairs in there.

I would also recommend trying the mutton roll. They have thin skin and a good amount of mutton inside."}
{"text":"Very delicious 'Sri Lanken and South Asian' food.. my bf says it is 'Tamil' food but I'm not sure of proper semantics. Anyway, we ordered beef kouthu, mutton biryani and tandoori chicken leg and it came up to only $15.50!! Wicked deal, everything cooked fresh. Flavours are nice and robust. Option of non spicy or spicy. I asked for non spicy but with all the flavourings I would say non spicy is actually mild lol. There is something in there giving it a kick anyway.. and humongous portions!!"}
{"text":"The kotthu here is the main draw.  Very well-seasoned and fat-free!

Short eats - fish cutlets are divine!  The vegetarian roti nicely seasoned ... and the TV/blaring music great entertainment!  Nice place, good prices and FRESHLY MADE!  Chicken kotthu was out of bounds delish!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went back again to get the same thing. The biryani was delicious. The guys provided excellent customer service. He said that he messed up my order last time and gave me a discount. Well done, very professional.

The price, portion and taste is top-notch at this place! 

I have already recommended this place to a few of my co-workers!"}
{"text":"Food:
I had an order of the mutton kothu. This dish is basically diced up roti, mutton, egg, onion, peppers, and curry. The mutton kothu here is by far one of the best I've had in Scarborough. Though it is very spicy, you can ask for it mild or not spicy. The blend and texture of each ingredient is perfect and compliments each other perfectly. NO DINE IN, TAKE OUT AND CATERING ONLY. The portion for the kothu is good and it will fill you up for sure!

Service:
The service was good. It was an in and out process. Not much talking or greeting but the job was done. The restaurant here before was named gasa but the chef is the same person.

Decor:
The ambiance is quite basic but it's a restaurant mainly based off take out and catering so it's fine. Everything looks clean!

Price:
The price is good and the dish costed me $6.50 which is cheaper than most places as well!"}
{"text":"Came here on a referral and was not disappointed. 

They are truly good at what they do.  I ordered the Lamb and Chilli Chicken Kothu Roti and they were both good. 

Portions are huge and they are not stingey... but remember you are eating majority carbs! i do find myself being all bloated and guilty after.  But that is at no fault of the restaurant.  

i could not even finish half the portion they gave... which ensured that i had lunch the next day.

Keep in mind it is very spicy.  

It is definitely not an everyday thing, but once in a while its good to change it up.  I think i will probably return one of these days."}
