{"text":"Despite no reviews we stopped at China Town as we were passing by for lunch. The buffet lunch is $6.29 and it was fresh and warm (not hot). All the buffet food was tasty and we went back for seconds. I'm a foodie so I can't give more than 3 stars but for a quick and slightly above average quality buffet we will come back.  The floors were pretty dirty but everything else is clean. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"my wife and I went for dinner because we thought it was a buffet. it was not . service sucked food was nasty as i dont know what . the chicken and the beef tasted the same . will not ever come to this place again .had to go to the other Chinese food down the street . what a big waste of money"}
{"text":"Decided to come and give them another try no food on buffet. Service almost suck. But to top it all off they the workers were changing a baby's shirt dipper on one of the back tables NASTY last visit ever"}
{"text":"Ordered take out which consisted of sesame chicken, cashew chicken and crab ragoons. Were were told 20 minutes for pick up and we waited an additional 15 minutes at the restaurant when we went to pick up. There was a customer that came back to try to return the food because it was stale. Our food as well was stale, cold, and had ZERO flavor. Will not return here. Stay away from this one."}
{"text":"We hunted and hunted for a good chinese place by our house, and finally noticed China Town. We LOVED it. Great service, the food is super tasty (try the Singapore Chow Mei Fun), and they always throw in a little something extra for us - sometimes soup, sometimes donuts.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I go to this place a lot for the buffet which is ok. Not really that big of a buffet and if you don't get there when it is fresh you might get some pretty cold food. However this review is about their take-out service. I give them a C- for this experience. They do not give a good portion size to take home and the food was a little bland. I expected more from them. I ordered the pan fried dumpling and the sauce that came with it was very gross it was like they didn't know how to make the proper sauce so they just gave me soy sauce and some spices to go a long with it. It was not good at all. I will probably be going back but only for the buffet would not recommend take out and i will not be doing that again."}
{"text":"Ummmm yeah. It's really just edible. The other reviews are right and this isn't some \"mark your map\" sort of place but you can get fed. Between the slow services and the kid playing video games we managed to eat a meal laden with vegetable oil. The green tea bag showed the Food Lion logo so it made you think about just how damn cheap it was. We were even more shocked at the point we paid since it was $40 for two of us. It wouldn't seem like much had the food been good.   The reason it still gets a two star is that the beef dish had a really nice wok flavor. They had lots of take out orders so maybe there is something I'm missing. Only two tables for dinner while we were there."}
{"text":"one of my favorite restaurant in town. great value, great food, excellent service. comparing to many other take out Chinese restaurants I've been to, it should be rated as a five star restaurant. Yet, the outside atmosphere there is quite simple an sketchy, but the inside is just like other regular Chinese restaurants. Overall, I strongly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good value, good food and good service Chinese Restaurant."}
{"text":"I  am truly upset with this resteraunt  I called my order in and as you can see menu  stated lo mein/chow mein with  rice and crispy noodles but waitress stated rice only comes with chow mein.  I told her that was not what menu said and then was put on hold for 5minutes very rude.  Hung up and called back and asked for manager she stated she was manager I said ok I will  pay for rice but I will write this on yelp.  Picked up order and no rice at all had to ask for it.  Food is okay portion small so might not return"}
{"text":"I went to this establishment today and picked up lunch to go.  When I ordered my food I said.. \"I don't want any bell peppers in anything.\"  Well, my husbands menu items didn't have any, but all of mine did.  I have no issues with eating off his plate.. but I shouldn't have to throw my food away because there are so many peppers in it that I find it inedible.  If I do go back, I'll be installing all of the bags and checking, before I leave.  I really wanted to like this place, too."}
{"text":"Everything you would expect on their menu. I walked in and ordered takeout. I was able to place my order and it was ready within in a few minutes. Kung pao chicken with white rice. I had asked what veggies come with the chicken--celery, chestnuts, peppers, carrots, peanuts--missing what I wanted most; mushrooms. :(  The flavor was lacking any heat. I added Sriracha to give it the kick I was looking for.  Rice was good, place white rice. Sticky as you would expect. I noted the health grade was a 95 A.  I would maybe return if craving takeout Chinese but would definitely ask them to kick it up about 2 notches I the heat."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Chinese food. A friend said to try them and that they were good.  Food was awful!! General tso's chicken was dry and the rice in the combo was try as well. The chicken and shrimp lo mein was horrible and the shrimp in it was a little as my pinky finger.. Noodles highly over cooked. Sorry but I will not be returning!!: ("}
{"text":"I love some good Chinese-- came in here as I was driving through with work and had an orange chicken craving. This place did not disappoint! It is a small restaurant around the corner from some national chains but I would recommend going into this local gem. The orange chicken was exactly what I was looking for and really fulfilled my craving. The staff was extremely friendly and prompt to get me my lunch when I was in a rush. I will make it a point to come back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"My issue with this place has always been about consistency. The food has never been terrible but the times I've ordered a shrimp dish, the ingredients seem to be different. Peppers/no peppers, Carrots and onion/no carrot. I recently decided to give them another TO-GO try since they are close by and they have online ordering. The fried wings, buffalo wings and egg rolls were good, not greasy at all.  The Singapore Mei Fun was spicy enough and the General Tso was good also. I will likely include them as an option on the nights when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Let's be honest folks - sometimes you just need some good old Chinese takeout. The place is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is good. They have a pretty expensive menu that has all of your basic Chinese preferences. I particularly like the Sacha chicken and their dumplings. This is one of those places I know I can call, place an order and pick my food up quickly on the way home. It is a regular go to for us"}
{"text":"My hubby got sick off this food. Plus we got there for our first time and the lady acted as if she didn't want to respond to us as if she was upset we even came in"}
{"text":"First I like to point out that ChinaTown is a \"Chinese Buffett\". Though they have a menu, most people come here for the unlimited food.   It is rather quiet. Usually, these places are, but as a tip to the management, silence in a restaurant equals awkward silence.   Food Buffet Review:  - The Crab Rangoon's are A-OK, good fry, but not much crab meat, might as well call it a Cream Cheese Rangoon.  - Egg Rolls are alright, nothing too special, average.  - Fried Rice, unfortunately, is underwhelming. Usually, that is my draw to Chinese restaurants, but this taste like standard minute-rice with soy sauce.   - Chicken Fingers were one of the better items here, fry was perfect, the chicken itself was tender, much better than their Orange Chicken.   - I would stay clear of the veggies, most are drowning in sauce/water and soggy.   Overall, not a place to go often. if you're in the mood for Chinese Buffett, a quick *cheap* bite for lunch is worth it."}
{"text":"We have tried this place two times. Food was decent at best the first time for dinner. The second time we walked out before our meal even started due to the dry burnt food on the buffet and rude service. It's now an ongoing joke in our household of \"are you hungry enough to even eat at China Town?\" We're shocked it's survived this long with so little customers."}
{"text":"The food here is ok. Not the best, not the worst. The General Tso chicken is good but too sweet. The hot and sour soup was my favorite thing here. My biggest issue is that they don't have fountain drinks so they bring you can a warm can of Diet Coke and a cup of ice. This is one of my peeves with restaurants but to make it worse, they charged me a $1 for each can. The restaurant was also very warm. I would probably go back but only for takeout."}
{"text":"A little run down.. I searched around for the best deal on chicken wings for a get-together I was having and they had the best deal.. Not the best Chinese food but it was convenient and not expensive compared to Red Bowl"}
{"text":"Once I seen the reviews I was ready to go elsewhere. But my husband talked me into trying their food. I'm SO happy he did! The food was awesome! We ordered from the night menu to go. Definitely worth the price! This is our new Chinese take out place!"}
{"text":"Awkward place no music, just really quiet, and empty. I give 2 stars because the lady was really nice and other wise would of gave it no stars"}
