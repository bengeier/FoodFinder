{"text":"I get the chicken salad on a toasted croissant every time I come here with the Ranch bowtie pasta. I miss eating here when I am away at college."}
{"text":"OK maybe 4 stars if you don't have the cookies.
The tomato soup and grilled cheese for $6.95 - no brainer. GC was great - soup was in the unexpected but really good category. The old time decor, the baked goods, the facade and Madison in general call for 5 stars.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"The Downtowner is a great place for lunch.
They have great sandwiches and sides. 
The redskin potato salad is awesome. They also have very yummy Monster cookies.
I would highly suggest eating here!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are sooooo good here. But the potato soup I think has changed, still tastes ok but wish they would change it back.
Lately they seem under staffed and need a few more servers. Love the downtowner though so we will keep coming back"}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with the food, service, or price.  It wasn't bad, but Madison has better options, IMO."}
{"text":"While visiting Historic Madison downtown we decided to stop at The Downtowner for lunch having never been there.
Nice clean restaurant with friendly staff who had smiles on their faces and seemed happy to be there.   BIG plus in our books.   The waitress knew the whole menu and was patient and answered every question and gave her opinion of things based on what was asked of her.
Lots of different sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, and salads to choose from.  I chose the super cheesy grilled cheese while my partner chose the three cheese ham grill with 2 bread sticks and a side salad.   The breads sticks were so good we ordered another full order to split between us.  We both agreed that the sandwiches were great, the portions nice sized for lunch time and the service was good.
Of special note are the giant cookies they sell. A nice select of flavors to match most tastes and we decided to get a couple for the road.
All total our bill was still just under $20.   We considered that quite a bargain for the amount of food we received and will definitely go back when we are in the area again!"}
{"text":"Don't know what the food tastes like as the service is terrible. My wife and I stopped in their for lunch on a Saturday and could not get waited on.  We ended up walking out after about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Decent selection of sandwiches on tasty breads served with dill spears and bagged Lay's. I had the black bean sandwich with tons of veggies, others in our party enjoyed their choices as well. Wish that there was something a little bit more upscale about the lunch - homemade potato chips or kettle chips maybe? Happy people working here and, despite the worn atmosphere throughout, the restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went here for lunch on a mini road trip to Madison. It's a nice place- in one of the many very old storefronts in downtown Madison. We split the BLT and the chicken salad sandwiches between us and we're blown away by both! The bread sprinkled with Parmesan! The creamy chicken salad! As much bacon as your heart could desire! All so good. What I loved is that the portions were just right, too. Some places don't give you much and others give you an absurd amount, but I think this place gets it just right."}
{"text":"I love the Downtowner!  The sandwiches are delish. The BLT and BLT Wrap are in the top 3 for me. The chicken salad on toasted croissant is the best ever! The giant cookies are addictive. Their Greek pizza is the best ever!  Great place to eat in or get it to go and picnic down by the river."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't review the food. My family sat down, watched the table next to us get drinks, order lunch, get their lunch, and eat their lunch. We asked to order twice and were told that they would get our server. We'd probably still be waiting on her! Walked across the street to Franco's and had great service and great food!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop! I like the use of fresh ingredients and sandwiches, salads and soups for all tastes. My favorite sandwich is the Reuben served on crusty swirl rye bread. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Having business to take care of in Milton, my coworker and I crossed the bridge for an early lunch.  On a recommendation from a local, we tried the Downtowner.  Yum, very good sandwich/deli shop.  It was early for lunch, about 11 am on a weekday, so service and food prep were very very quick.  

My 7\" chicken bacon ranch pizza was tasty and had good quality ingredients, like huge juicy pieces of chicken and crunchy bacon crumbles.  A crispy crust, not too much ranch and not too much cheese added up to a good deal for a lunch pizza.  My coworker's Reuben was  huge and stuffed with meat; not a completely traditional Reuben since it had lettuce and tomato and such on it, but definitely a filling sandwich.

Probably won't be back in Madison anytime soon, but will be sure to stop here again when I am in town.  The rest of the menu looked to have some good options and a nice variety of sandwiches, soups, salads, pastas and pizza.  Oh, and there were huge cookies at the counter."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazing! I had their homemade chicken salad sandwich, which was terrific, and my husband had the Chicken Pesto Alfredo sandwich. I also ordered the Red Skin Potato and that was equally delicious. The environment is cozy and the service was quick and very friendly. If you're ever in Madison, IN, I highly recommend The Downtowner."}
{"text":"Stopped into Madison after a recent camping trip to the amazing Clify Falls State Park (check  out that place for sure) and wanted a good lunch place. This place was open and close to where we were, they were super busy and lots of people were waiting for their food so we thought is must have been good and walked in fully aware of the wait. I got the ham and bean soup to start, very good flavor, it wasn't very hot though. I was going to have them heat it up a bit but they were so busy and we were starving so I just ate it. My girlfriend had the reuben sandwich, I had a bite or two, it was very good! She also had a side of the potato salad and that was excellent. I ordered the hot brown and it was delicious! Probably one of the best I've had. I am only giving this place 3 stars instead of 4 stars because of the staff. Although they were nice to us, the way they treated some other patrons kinda turned us off. Like I said, they were super busy and some people are not as understanding but letting a table sit for 10 min with not even a drink order and then after they complain you let them sit there until they walk out is just a bad business practice. Food was 4 stars, service was 3. 3 stars for the luke warm soup too."}
{"text":"It feels like this place, locally owned and run, is just hell-bent on serving up dishes that aren't what people think they're ordering...

For example: grilled cheese and soup 'special' (though it seems more of an 'everyday'), neither involves grilling, actual cheese, or (even, unfortunately) soup.
 
My grilled cheese consisted of fairly fresh, thick-sliced bread, coated in a yellowish fluid (wasn't real butter--or even margarine, as it didn't crisp, not even a little) seasoned with garlic and hard cheese shavings (which would have been awesome & creative & tasty, if they'd just have waited until it toasted) and an unholy amount of melted 'cheese food' in the middle, still in recognizable slices.  It was definitely warmish, but not even remotely the toasty real dairy goodness implied by the phrase \"grilled cheese\"  Wasn't grilled.  Wasn't cheese. At best, was the equivalent of a college kid's drunken attempt at microwaving freezer-case garlic toast & 3 slices of processed cheese food.  Yum???

'Soup' was a solid at room temperature.  I don't even want to know what makes that happen.  I could have used it as spackle / wall compound.  

(Insert sad face)

Folks mentioning that they serve one weird reuben have lost the plot: lettuce, onion, tomato don't add to a well-made reuben.  They distract from something inadequate. And in this case, they hide that the swiss isn't, there's (again) no grilling, and the dressing should go in the sauerkraut, not glopping up the bread.

Prices were fine, though I wish I'd known I was going to wind up with sacks of plain Lays.  Wasn't asked by the counter person - who was also not particularly helpful about the menu, aside from the few options written on the chalk board behind her - about sides.  Ugh.  Who wants plain lays? I'd rather pay an upcharge and get a palatable side that I can enjoy.  But, apparently, who cares?  Not them!  

Well, that's awesome.

Anyway - it's not terrible, but there are better local options in Madison, for sure.

Location is pretty standard small town eatery.  Nothing particularly notable."}
{"text":"Great Cafe!  The best tomato florentine soup we have ever tasted.  Keith's salad was very fresh and my grilled cheese was good.  
Very busy with the holiday, but the service was outstanding.  We will make a point to stop in Madison for the soup when traveling."}
{"text":"Fantastic hot brown!  Good prices and substantial portions.  The kid's meals ($5) were very nice and filling.  We really enjoyed our meal here.  The server was also nice, but service was very slow."}
{"text":"I hate to say it because this was a favorite of mine when I was a student at nearby Hanover College but The Downtowner is cute restaurant that serves average to slightly-above-average sandwiches and has average to well-below-average service. If I'm in Madison I will likely still stop in for the sake of nostalgia but my most recent trip there was an eye opener for sure.

Do have a cookie or piece of cake while there though!"}
{"text":"Best lunch spot in Madison Indiana. Little Italy is one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. The sugar cookies are a perfect accent to the savory delicious sandwiches. It takes a while for them to make a sandwich which is surprising because they aren't that large. Location is hard to park if you have elderly people who struggle to walk because it's on a main road. But other than that it is excellent. The location is right next to some of the best stores in the downtown location so you can walk off all the food you ate."}
{"text":"Love love love their chicken Alfredo pesto sandwich!!!! Great cookies, too!"}
{"text":"The Really Big Reuben is to die for. The redskin potato salad and tomato florentine soup are great as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely cannot drive through Madison without stopping at The Downtowner. The Spinach Chicken Wrap rocks my socks off! I don't think I've ever ordered anything else in the 10+ times I've been here. Simply fabulous."}
{"text":"From 12/24/12:
I got the Cafe Mocha, but I'd suggest skipping it. It tasted nothing like coffee, more like the most watered down hot cocoa I've ever had in my life. 

There were wet, crumpled napkins all over the left side of the restaurant that you ended up stepping on, while seated."}
{"text":"Small space. Stuffy. No one acknowledged us for 10 minutes while waiting for a table. These girls were they unfriendliest people. That hall to the bathroom and the bathroom was dirty and gross. The food was just ok. The drinks were 2 liters. If I'm ever in Madison again I won't be eating here."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. I was in Madison with some friends for the craft show thing. One friend had heard this was the place to go to get some good food that was great for your wallet. It definitely did not disappoint. 

I was pleasantly surprise actually at how good it was. I opted for the soup and sandwich special. Which came with an over sized grilled cheese and loaded potato soup. Yum! It also came with chips which were not eaten because we were all so full from the actual meal. 

Although we had to wait quite a while because they were so packed from the craft show, I would say it was worth the wait. I will for sure be back to try some more of there food when I am in town again. I have my eyes on their BLT the next time. 

I'd say if you are looking for decent food that won't break your budget, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed eating here as we were able to get a table out on the sidewalk. It was a beautiful day and it's fun to eat outside with our friends and watch people. my wife and I both ordered the Downtowner Club. It was piled high with meat, cheese and goodness. It was scrumptious. The service was prompt and our server was very good. We took our time and didn't have to rush which was so nice. We can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and the food is always great.  I tend to get a sandwich with three sides (the pasta salad is really good.)  Although a few weeks ago, I did try their Hot Brown, and being from Louisville I must admit that it awesome! Dare I even say that it may have surpassed the Brown Hotels' original.

That said, I do give them 4 stars instead of 5 because they do seem to always be understaffed. The workers are nice and friendly, but if there was just one more employee working things would run much smoother.

Lastly...Do not leave without a cookie or two!"}
{"text":"So once I found this place in college, I always went back.  It was good for a quick bite to eat and get away from gross, fatty campus food!  The sandwiches were cheap and delish.  I guess anything does compared to HC food but their sandwiches kept me coming back.
They have a good enough menu.  It's better than just submitting to Subway for a sandwich.  Their soups are good, too.  Service wasn't always the fastest but it was still a good bite to eat."}
{"text":"Wow!! The French Dip was a 10.. A perfection of sliced meat on a toasted hoagie bun.. Wow is all I can say.. End that with a huge Peanut butter cookie and you will be in heaven...Ice tea was sweet as my woman's kisses.. Mwwaah !!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch during the Chatauqua festival at around 2:30 in the afternoon.  We were told the way would be 30-45 minutes.  Went down the street to a store, came back 20 minutes later to find they had already called out name.  Waited about 5 minutes and got a table.  Waitress looked like she was hating life in general.  We put in our orders (there were 4 of us) and we waited..... And waited.... And waited.... And waited some more as we watched people who had ordered after us get their food, eat, and leave.  Finally after about 50 minutes our good came out cold and soggy.   Our waitress couldn't have cared less. We spoke with the manager who comped all of or meals.   Understand that this was a busy day, but came here about a year ago and it was even busier then, but food and service was way better.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Ate here because the desk clerk at Clifty Falls Lodge recommended it. We were greeted promptly when we entered. The menu had a nice selection. Sandwiches were about $8-9. Bread sticks were $5 for 4. Soup of the day was loaded potato. My daughter and I got it and agreed it was a bit bland. We (4) each got a different sandwich. They were all generously loaded and very good. The iced tea was smooth. They got very busy and service got a bit slow but it was understandable. Overall a very good experience and we would go back if in area again."}
{"text":"The Downtowner features a huge menu, loaded with sandwiches, including as many original sandwiches as traditional one. There are wraps and gourmet pizzas a well. Everything we had was very good, reasonably priced, and the service was fast, friendly and efficient. 

I'd suggest to them to put a menu in the window, as there are a number of restaurants in the area, but looking at the lunch crowd on an average non-holiday Friday, I suppose they don't need to."}
{"text":"Mediocre food served in a nonexistent décor. Staff is friendly enough, but cleanliness is not a priority with this restaurant.  Both sandwiches (Union Jack ham and Little Italy sub) had way too much sauce and the bread was covered in a thick, overpowering layer of parmesan.  Not particularly tasty.  Better choices can be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food!! If you're looking for a great sandwich, wrap, salad or soup then go to The Downtowner! The grilled cheese has Parmesan on the buttered outside and is sooo very good. The Hot Brown is also a delicious choice! Each soup I've had has been great but the loaded potato wins as favorite. And they have a great combo offer with 1/2 signature sandwich and a bowl of soup. The 1/2 sandwich is huge as is the cup of soup so it's quite a filling meal. And definitely get several cookies before you leave or you'll be really sorry. The cranberry white chocolate is amazing!"}
{"text":"We ate here while in madison and really enjoyed it - its not much on atmosphere (the high ceilings and wood/tile floors mean it can get LOUD), but the food was great and of a great value! I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Was in Madison for one meal and found this really good sandwich shop around dinnertime. The staff were friendly and attentive. I had a \"duo\" with a chicken salad sandwich and a side of potato salad. Also came with a bag of kettle chips.

The sandwich was excellent!!!! 5 million stars for that chicken salad, which was creamy, nutty, and mildly sweet thanks to whole grapes mixed right in! The potato salad was good, too--a tad too creamy for my taste, but well-seasoned and incredibly fresh-tasting!

I am not generally big on sandwiches, but I would definitely return if I wasn't just passing through."}
{"text":"Went to Lunch with my mom and we decided to stop at The Downtowner in Madison. I hadn't been there in about three years, when my niece was a server there. The food was excellent. I had the spinach chicken wrap. It was more the size of a small burrito than a typical wrap. It was delicious. Mom went with the chicken salad and potato soup. There was too much chicken salad for one meal so she took the rest home. That's how a restaurant knows it's food is good. If you don't take the left overs home you're saying, 'just throw it out.' She really enjoyed the potato soup, a favorite of hers, sometimes my niece, when she finished her shift, would bring it home to her. We treated ourselves to two huge slices of chocolate cake. The Downtowner is in the center of Madison, IN, well within walking distance of all the stores on it's beautiful Main Street."}
{"text":"The Downtowner was one of the few restaurants operating in Madison on New Year's Day.  We stopped in for lunch.  Service was friendly, the food was good and very reasonably priced -- what else do you need to know?  One of our party ordered a double espresso -- it came in a proper ceramic cup and saucer and was well executed.  I had the southwest chicken salad which I enjoyed.  We would happily return."}
{"text":"While taking a short trip to visit a relative in Hanover, In., we stopped at The Downtowner in Madison, In. for lunch.
There were 5 of us and I quizzed each one on their lunch. Each enjoyed what they had, and agreed it was well worth the stop.
My food was filling, tasty, hot, and reasonably priced. The menu has many offerings so everyone can find something to order.
I guess my only complaint would be, they were so busy, we couldn't find a table to fit all 5 of us. So I sat off to the side at an adjacent table.
The restaurant must have a good rep, because when we left, they were still busy."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in looking for vegetarian fate for lunch. We were happy to at least 3 sandwiches available and several sides. The staff were friendly and took care to note that the pasta salad had bacon in it. I'd look here again during a Madison visit."}
{"text":"my first destination for downtown food. the service isn't the best, and it's small, but the food has never, ever failed to impress."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when i am Madison. Fresh sandwiches made fantastic ingredients. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"We had the $5 lunch with soup, sandwich and drink.  The creamy chicken soup was outstanding!  We come here every time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"Ok.  Nothing special.  Good value.  Very busy with local folks."}
{"text":"Coffee is below average and some of their machines don't even work. The whole look, food, and mood of the place would be average if the service actually served and would make sure their customers are served correctly. The cashier bar was empty when I went in and remained empty until I went to the back kitchen area to ask them some questions. Wish it could have been better. Has great potential."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, something for everyone on the menu.

I had the sandwich (Reuben -- a little weird because they put tomato, lettuce & onion on it, but it was tastey), kids had pizza (pretty good, a little too much cheese, and the cheese was on top), and others in the group had soup & veggie pizzas.

Madison is a cute town -- you can feel the economic strain, but it's worth visiting the town and giving some well deserved business to restaurants like this and the other shop keepers!"}
{"text":"The Downtowner is a solid option for a lunch or quick meal in downtown Madison. 

A close friend who lives in the area recommended that we meet up for lunch here. Who am I to turn down a recommendation from a local?!? 

The Downtowner is pretty basic on the inside. You will immediately recognize that it's a quintessential, small-downtown sandwich shop. No frills. 

I ordered the grilled cheese and a cup of chicken noodle soup, following the advice of the server. Who am I to turn down a recommendation from a server?!? 

And I was pleasantly impressed.

The bread on the grilled cheese was perfected grilled in butter and had a dusting of parmesan, I believe, on top. I want all of my grilled cheeses to have parmesan on them now.

And the chicken noodle soup was adequately chock full of noodles, some veggies and chunks of chicken. It hit that right balance between salty and bland.

These items were not gourmet or complicated -- just nice comfort food. 

Our meals came out quickly, and they were pretty cheap, from what I remember. What more can you ask for? 

I would happily eat at The Downtowner again."}
