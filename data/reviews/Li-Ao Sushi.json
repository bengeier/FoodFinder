{"text":"Our go-to place in Calgary.  Have yet to find anything better on the otherwise seafood-questionable prairie."}
{"text":"Sushi. Simplified. Good, friendly service. I was surprised that this popular and highly-rated place appeared so normal. No fancy decorations or fishtanks. Just good, fresh, affordable sushi, etc. And good service.  The rolls were tasty and well-executed, the cones were new to me but a nice handheld twist.   The black sesame mochi was really good so save room.  It was not something trying to be what it is not. If you want fancy, go elsewhere. If you want food in a friendly atmosphere... And a lot of it for reasonable prices, go here!"}
{"text":"Been to this sushi place twice now and both times has been a great experience.  Both my girls love it and eat until they are full.  The staff are wonderful and the service is fast.  Glad this place opened so close to home!  I will be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"Best sushi going! No more driving to mid-central Calgary for great sushi. The salmon sushi is so large, it's hard to eat in one bite. The tempura, fantastic! And the Alberta roll, to die for. All for a great price. Plus, you'll feel like your making friends when you meet chef-owner and co-owner, Ben and Henry. This is a must visit for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"yum...need I say more?  Of course I'll say more...these guys deliver...to Marda Loop.  Prices are very competitive for Calgary. Food was amazing - not a crap load of rice on the rolls like most sushi joints in this city.   Fresh and amazing.  The delivery guy...driving a BMW and in his kitchen whites...not the usual kind of driver who shows up.    Very impressed - will DEFINITELY order from them again.  I can't wait to actually go in this place."}
{"text":"This is a recently opened sushi place (3 weeks now) down south. Waaaayyy down south near 162nd. A group of 4 of us went, and although it was busy, we were seated promptly. As soon as we actually stepped inside we were greeted by all the staff shouting hello to us in Japanese. They have the standard sushi menu, but focus a little more on presentation. A friend of mine ordered the Female Dragon roll, and they shaped the sushi and the sauce into an actual dragon. The sushi was fresh and as I mentioned presented well. The only difference between it and other sushi places - especially those downtown - is the price. It is significantly cheaper. I only left $20 lighter than when I came, versus the typical $35 plus I spend in all the other sushi places I frequent. My friends and I all agreed we had the best service ever, in fact one friend told the owner - who intorduced himself as Henry - how good it was, because she was that impressed. Continuing about the owner, he was very involved with serving, and chatted to everyone that came in. He also came around with boxes of Pocky sticks to hand to all the clients. He seemed to even know some clients by name. Our server was at our table pouring out tea for us every time he saw it was getting empty - I can't say I've ever had that done at a restaurant for me. I think based on everything, I would go to this place again every once in a while, because it really is a cut above the ones downtown as far as service, and price. Also, it makes sense that the sushi tasted so good, the people from Li-Ao come from Kinjo sushi."}
{"text":"Li-Ao Sushi, located in the Shoppes of Bridlewood, offers fresh sushi and authentic Japanese dishes. With their second location found in Nolan Hill Blvd NW, you really got to try Li-Ao if you haven't done so already!  Li-Ao Sushi is not new to me, I used to be a regular customer a couple years back and now I occasionally drop by from time to time. I've notice a lot of changes with Li-Ao over the years and the biggest change that caught my eye was their logo out in front. I'm not sure when they changed it but it does look fresher than before!   Yes the prices are cheap but the plating, the portion and the flavour packs a punch. Upon seating at a booth you'll receive complementary deep fried tuna gyoza, where else can you get a complementary sample? No where!   Make sure you can finish what you ordered, I accidentally went a little overboard but hey it was actually worth it. Now I can describe in detail every single dish that was ordered but I rather not and let the pictures do all the talking, all I can say is the plating, portion and flavour does make a big difference.   If I were to criticize a particular dish it would be the AAA Steak Combo, why? My only concern is the meat to rice ratio is waay off. Lots of rice but not enough steak to have per serving unless the ratio balances so it would me an equal of rice to meat to vegetable but nevertheless it is still a good dish either way!  I would recommend Li-Ao to everyone and would differently come back again in the near future. Li-Ao is the number one go to for a non AYCE sushi restaurant in the Deep South."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in Calgary, it is really too bad it is so far south!   Very friendly service, delicious food. I enjoy the extra perks like the free samples and Pocky. I love that the sashimi is very generous, the pieces are huge! Not only are the portion sizes large, but the prices are very reasonable. The restaurant is also cute and clean inside."}
{"text":"My kids love this place so I love this place.  The staff are friendly and quick, great with kids.   The food.. Oh the food is so good!! My kids love the Miso Soup, they had 2 bowls in one sitting.  The dumplings are unlike any I've tried, so crispy and the sauce is delicious and tangy.   We ordered the Maki combo plate. We got 1 salmon, 1 tuna and 2 California rolls. They were fresh and tasted great. My son thought the California rolls has to much mayo on the crab. But I thought they were great.  We also had an order of Prawn tempura - Crispy on the outside and plump prawn on the inside. Yum!!  Thank you for being so close to home, we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Instead of repeating everything my sister just reviewed, I will simply agree that Li Ao has great service, great food, a friendly atmosphere and is cheaper than your usual sushi joint. They also have different menu items than other places Ive been. Next time, Im trying the deep fried rolls."}
{"text":"Great place, awesome service and complement appetizer. We tried out the dynamite rolls, California rolls, teriyaki chicken, Alberta roll and meso soup.... Everything was delicious. This place also delivers which is nice; however the delivery is not that great for the food tend to be moved around a lot, so defiantly try it out but actually go to the restaurant or pick up the food your self."}
{"text":"Cool little place, friendly service, tasty food! Really enjoyed the mango shrimp appetizer, large pieces of sashimi, and the free Pocky sticks as we left. Definitely worth going back to."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi and this is my favourite spot in Calgary. They have a great selection of traditional and modern takes. Their seasonal creations are interesting and tasty. The staff are wonderful and always send us on our way each with a box of Pocky.   My only suggestion would be to offer Sapporo (or another Japanese beer) on tap."}
{"text":"Yum! Love Sushi and nave been to every Sushi Restaurant in Calgary.  This is by far the best in the city. I will choose or every time. Henry is the best!"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh sushi, superb and friendly service.   Took my daughter in again today and we walked out with our usual happiness. Never fails. If you live far, it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Love this place staff are so friendly, food is good! Great combination and the poki at the end just caps it off"}
{"text":"Finally a great sushi restaurant in South Calgary!  After reading some reviews, I was pleasantly surprised at this restaurant to find Ben and Henry, the former chefs at another frequented sushi restaurant that has long since lost its appeal.  Li Ao is a great restaurant that is not gimicky, though serves great sushi, and at an affordable price.    Congratulations to the coowners on such a successful restaurant."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fresh and at a fair price, plus the service is always fantastic.  I've come in multiple times, as well as placing pick-up orders via the online SkipTheDishes service--they've always gotten my orders ready very quickly and without any problems.  First off, the quality of the sushi is really great for the price you pay, and I cannot stress that enough--as someone who moved from the West coast, I usually expect some pretty sketchy sushi when I'm inland, but this is honestly pretty darn good for Calgary sushi.  The rice is soft, the sushi doesn't fall apart after you pick it up, the seaweed isn't made of rubber, and the fish is actually pretty moist and fresh.  The combos are your best bet in terms of price--twenty pieces of assorted sushi for $9.99 is great when you're craving something fresh--compare this with Bento sushi at a grocery store, where you're probably paying $7.99+ for eight-ten pieces that are all hard as a rock.  I usually pick up a Li-Ao 20pc combo when there's no time to make dinner at home after work.  When you go there, they always give you deep fried gyoza with sauce to try as a complimentary starter (and sometimes, you might even get free fish in the middle of your meal, which has happened to me randomly three times now).  After your meal is over, you are offered a free pack of Pocky sticks per person for dessert.  (I've often wondered this as an outsider: are free Pocky sticks just a Calgary thing? Either way, it's awesome.) Freebies aside, whatever you order is probably going to be pretty good.  My personal favourites are just the more regular sushi & sashimi (salmon, roe, etc.), rather than the more 'novelty' options on the menu.  I haven't tried everything on the menu yet because it is VAST--there's over a hundred items to choose from, and the ordering system is very 'Chinese', despite being a Japanese restaurant, which makes sense as the staff are all Chinese.  Like going to Dim Sum, you'll order by looking at the menu (that consists of only pictures) and selecting the number and name of the corresponding item on a separate sheet.  Lastly, quick shout-out in terms of service--you can tell they're really trying to make a good impression on customers as a new restaurant in the area, and the staff are fantastic, especially with kids.  I hope they keep up the great service, because I know that's what is making the difference for some patrons in the area.  Not everyone I know is as satisfied with the sushi as I am, but they cannot deny that the servers are always pleasant & friendly, no matter what time of day you go in or who serves your table / prepares your pick-up."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new place to try in the south so I ordered take out from here through skip the dishes. The ordering was easy, they followed all my requests (no mayo, extra wasabi), but I had to ask for more soy as there were 2 packs given for 3 people. The rolls were only ok. There was a yam/avocado roll that was amazing, but nothing was super awesome because the rice felt hard like grocery store sushi. They were super quick, really friendly and the prices are cheap for Calgary, but I don't like hard/cold rice so I probably won't be back for take out. Maybe dine in is better."}
{"text":"AMAZING sushi!! The staff are ALWAYS very welcoming and give us free fried dumplings cause we go there so often! Love this place, best sushi I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The customer service and sushi prices are the best in deep south Calgary. The only reason I give it a 4 star rather than a 5 is because I have had tastier sushi downtown Calgary, although the sushi here is still delicious!"}
{"text":"Decently priced with friendly service but the over-use of deep frying is kind of a turn off at a Japanese restaurant. I love gyoza but the deep-fried dumplings they serve here are quite greasy."}
{"text":"Sushi and sashimi portions are very large and has been great in the past.  My wife and I recently went again and found the restaurant very dirty and the service was poor.  The walls are splattered in sauce, floors in need of a sweep and mop, glassware filmy and unclean,  what's the kitchen look like?. Such a shame of a good place, love to see it turn around"}
{"text":"I used to go to the south location and this Nolan location is just ask good.  We went there yesterday to try out their happy hour special, 42 pieces platter. It is super good value for 30 dollars. Me and my wife were really happy with the food. The waitress was really friendly and helpful.  Will go again."}
{"text":"Today we finally made it over to Li-Ao to order some take-out. WOW!! First of all, the service was impeccable. While we waited for our order, the kitchen sent us over some deep fried spicy salmon gyoza to try. DELICIOUS!! A few minutes later we received some rolls to try. We had asked them to put the volcano sauce on the side for one item (it was our first visit & you never know how spicy is spicy) and they accidentally put the sauce on soooo offered us four out of the eight to try while they remade the entire item. (When we got home we saw that they included the four \"sauced\" rolls with the eight \"unsauced\" free of charge!) By the way, the volcano sauce isn't intolerably spicy. It's yummy! On our way out the door we each received a box of Pocky. Double Yum! Even though our food spent more than 30min in their respective containers, it was flavourful, exceeding our already high expectations. My 14 month old took a liking to the yam tempura (very surprising as he's a picky eater). We will certainly be regulars!"}
{"text":"I'll come to realize that all sushi places have small portions of sushi! We like it here because it's Quality! I don't know why we stop coming but now we're coming back again! So many places to choose from! Honestly it's very good to hear! I like the owners here they are very friendly!They  try to keep your customers very happy"}
{"text":"Wow...this place is legit! If it were somewhere closer to civilization then I'm sure it would be jammed 24/7.    First off, when I walked into the place and every single employee shouts something in Japanese to you....totally reminded me of every restaurant I went to in Japan.  Then when I noticed that no one really speaks great English then I knew this place was gonna be good.    Huge portions of fish served nigiri or sashimi and it was sooooo fresh.....and cheap! I like how there is a variety of tuna to choose from and a variety of different cuts aswell.The sake was actually a brand I recognize and was nice a smooth.  All in all it was a hit....not the absolute best sushi I've ever had, but definitely a sweet score for the price.  If I can find an excuse to be in that neighborhood then I'll definitely be stopping in again!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that the food is great, the service even better. The owners seem to really care and are involved in the kitchen and serving. Took some of my family there and we all loved the food. My granddaughter could not get enough. Took my iPad in with a photo of my granddaughter eating in the restaurant and really enjoying it....one of the owners took it to show to all the staff. Family who live in the north of Calgary would be willing to pay deliver charges as the pricing is so much more inexpensive to their area....a meal for less than $40 for 4 of us, 3 adults and a 16 month old with a voracious appetite, would have cost over $80 there"}
{"text":"I and my daughter really loves it! Sushi are prefect and fresh."}
{"text":"Reasonable price and good portions of food. The ramen is on special once you order around 8pm. It always tasted really good. My all time favorite is the grilled squid."}
{"text":"OMG I just want to say that this is my go-to sushi place now. Our meal started with a free sample of gyoza that was delicious. The place is clean and nicely furnished, prices were reasonable, and the food is DELICIOUS. My favorite has to be the mango rolls, which were about $9 for 8 pieces. It was absolutely delicious, and the service was SPECTACULAR. I was also delighted when they gave me a box of pocky afterwards. A super convenient location and super reasonable prices for very good food and service! Definetly reccomend!!!"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence for Li Ao. The first time I went, it was with my sister and a friend and the food was ok - nothing too spectacular.   The second time, I went with a couple friends who are VIP members of the south Li Ao locations and they knew the owner quite well. We got exceptional service and they brought us some tasty dishes to try (ones I probably wouldn't have ordered on my own): mango shrimp, beef tataki, fish gyoza and short ribs  They do have a variety of rolls and sushi, the downside is their dining menu does not have descriptions on what's in each roll so you have to grab a copy of the takeout menu to cross reference.   I could take it or leave it with Li Ao. I wouldn't be opposed to coming here, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I'm always happy to find a good sushi place, especially one near my neighbourhood!   I headed over there with a friend the other night, for the first time. It was about 6:45 on a Wednesday, and it was busy, but we got a table very quickly. I loved that the sushi order forms are laminated and re-usable! We ordered a variety of rolls, sushi and tempura. Everything was quick and fantastic! I was especially impressed at the amount of salmon on the salmon sushi we ordered! More fish than rice, which was a nice surprise!  We sat around chatting for a while after dinner and weren't rushed out . . . in fact, the owner (I assume) stopped by and refilled our tea and was very friendly!  The food was very good, the service was fantastic, and you can bet I'll go back the next time I want a good, laid-back meal with friends!"}
{"text":"First visit was a great surprise.....terrific sushi right here in the deep southwest of Calgary. Service was attentive and food arrived quickly. Mango roll is absolutely a treat. Will be back to try many more of the menu offerings."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular delivery customer of Li-Ao for many years. I even made friends with Henry and Ben. Guys I gotta tell ya my last order was the worst sushi I've ever had. The rolls were falling apart, my avocado and cucumber in the spider roll was brown, almost as if it was from the day before. In fact I could barely detect a soft shell crab in it. Not to mention the tiny warm sashimi. Your prices went up and the quality went way way down. Unfortunately i will not be ordering from you again. Quality control guys. Get on it."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Li Ao! It is such a treat to have a great sushi restaurant so close to home. Having a new baby I have been doing mostly take out these days and I have not had the chance to dine in since they have renovated but I hope to do so soon. As other reviewers have mentioned the staff are consistently friendly and the food... Omg. The sashimi is generously cut and I adore the salmon mango roll. Love the little extras like Pocky and extra rolls!"}
{"text":"Not too bad for a neighborhood sushi restaurant. They have a large selection for you to choose from and give you a complimentary starter which is a nice touch. The freshness of the fish is average, don't have too high expectations. Everything is decently priced so you can try a variety of menu items however it does add up quickly. The only thing I noticed is that the service could be better. Considering that I visited after the lunch rush, the server should've taken the extra mile to make my experience memorable as there was only one other table there."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best, if not the best sushi place in Calgary. My colleagues and I regularly come to Li-ao to have our monthly meetings over Sushi. The Sashimi has always been fresh, sushi always good. Chicken Katsu is also good. I haven't had anything that was un-palatable. Service is excellent and value is unbeatable.  The only thing i don't really like is their bubble tea. That, however, is not a problem since I always get their hot tea.   If my girlfriend or I are craving sushi, Li-ao is our go-to destination. You won't get any better value for your money when it comes to sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the NW. Always fresh and the staff ensures you liked your choices. Great selections and you can count on getting them in a timely manner no matter what time of day. Takeout is just as fresh and timely. I highly recommend it and it's very impressive for a suburban location."}
{"text":"This place unfortunately sits a bit in the shadow of Kinjo which is not too far from this location. I see that a few other reviewers mentioned that the chef used to work with Peter Kinjo, which explains the similarities with the pocky and menu as well.  Having said that, this place is worth checking out if you're in the area. Prices are reasonable and the food is quite delicious. I love getting the tokoyaki for appetizers, and their iced matcha is amazing during summer.   If you're in the area and considering stopping by, I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied. Ordered takoyaki & they only gave me very little sauce. packaging was very bad & food was cold."}
{"text":"I've been a customer since their first opening day and I still come here to eat. It has improved a lot over the years with new menu items to restaurant renovations and expansions (I still remember the time it was half the size as it was today that was shared with a flower shop). The owner is one of the friendliest person I have ever met, and still surprisingly remembers me.   As for food, I always order their Bubble Tea (Avocado), BBQ squid, Hot Beef Rolls, and Ramen if I crave for it. There are a lot of foods that are great and I highly recommend to try them all.  This is one of the few places I would keep coming back. Keep up the good work~!"}
{"text":"Got a chance to visit on a Saturday. They seemed steady and we were eager to try them out. The sushi and rolls we tried were fresh. Tempura was not greasy at all, very good! Service was attentive unlike some other posts. We weren't in a rush however, so maybe that had something to do with it.  We will visit again!"}
{"text":"Great service, good price and excellent food. It's consistently delicious, and the take out is great. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service was great. The waiter was really friendly. I will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"Didn't have the best experience here this afternoon.  First off, we had to ask for our Gyoza appetizers. You usually get them, but since we ordered some we didn't get them. When I asked about the free appetizers, our waitress looked at me and said \"You still want them\" ?  All we ordered today. -Miso soup -Tamago sushi -Spicy California roll -Teriyaki beef -Ginger beef -Tempura shrimp -Steak bites, with a side of whi0te rice -Ramen  All was relatively tasty except for the Ramen. It was tasteless, with small pieces of Chinese flavoured pork. Topped with a mesculin mix ? The ginger beef was rock hard. The Teriyaki beef was stringy.  All the food came out sporadically. The service was also on the slow side   All this for $70 dollars. Not even a goodbye when departing.  Also when being here in the past, all people dining would receive POCKY'S.  Today only the women and children.   I use to enjoy coming to this place. I even came here for my birthday lunch at the beggining of March.  It's funny how a bad experience can leave a bad taste In your mouth.  Sorry Lio's I think this may be my last visit."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant to eat in or order delivery from if you're in the mood for sushi.  Consistent quality in all of their food.  You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"NOLAN HILL LOCATION - Excellent sushi, moderately priced.  I've  only had take out service from Li-Ao, but it's always been quick, friendly service, and they have even included a pack of Pocky for dessert.  I believe they also offer 10% off take out orders over $35.  I have had several items from their menu but my favourites have been the yam tempura special, gyoza, and seared salmon sushi.  Definitely my go-to sushi restaurant in the 'hood."}
{"text":"I was sent a menu in the mail for Li-Ao Sushi and decided after giving it a good look that I should try this place, I am so happy I did!  For starters, could the staff get any friendlier here? I was quite impressed once we walked through the door with everyone (even the sushi chefs) greeted us.  We sat down and were brought water promptly and shortly after that we were brought a complimentary side dish. (How nice!) We ordered: Gyoza, Garden Roll, Unagi roll, Philadelphia roll, Spicy tuna roll, Mango roll and the Rainbow roll.  Oh. My. Goodness. These were seriously the best rolls I have ever tasted. Very fresh, just the right amount of rice and the presentation was lovely. The Gyoza was very tasty as well.   At the end of the meal they give out a box of pocky sticks instead of mints which I thought was a really nice touch - also the price was amazing...   Li-Ao, you got a new regular!"}
{"text":"Do you love overeating? Then Li-Ao is for you! I don't think I've ever had an item I didn't enjoy, and my eyes & imagination are always bigger than my stomach.  Li-Ao is the real deal for sushi in Calgary.  It seems to me that as most sushi places meet with success, their portion sizes, especially when it comes to sashimi, start to reduce - I am looking directly at you Globefish.  Henry and the team at Li-Ao are fantastic. They are always looking to find new and interesting things to create, and their food is very consistent (I've been there 30+ times)."}
{"text":"Big Portions for their late night special! I was able to share it with a friend and we were so full afterwards! This restaurant serves fresh sushi even late at night!  This is probably the best sushi restaurant for Calgary (big bang for your buck!)"}
{"text":"I really can't add anything to what people below me have said, but this place is the best I've found in the city.  Friendly staff, delicious food, and a nice environment makes this place a complete package.  I live nearby and have probably ordered from them 30+ times, and the only time I haven't been one hundred percent pleased was when I accidentally ordered the calamari instead of the tempura squid.  I was more upset at the thought that they'd changed the recipe than with it being the incorrect product!  Overall, I can't give this place enough praise.  They put so much thought into what they do, and their monthly specials are always an interesting change of pace should I get tired of my regular order.  Even if I didn't live nearby, I would be here frequently.  If you're heading to the Kinjo at the bottom of the hill, I'd say it's worth the extra five minute drive up here for some of what Li Ao's offering."}
{"text":"Super tasty sushi! The service was fast, attentive and friendly. The portions were huge too. The prices were reasonable especially for what we got and the waitstaff treated us like they really wanted us to be there. I honestly can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about this place yet... just moved into the area and ordered delivery twice.  While the sashimi was very fresh.. the delivery itself took forever!! First time I waited an hour and a half and the second time I waited for 2 hours and 15 minutes!!  I had to call them and was told something happened in the kitchen.  Maybe they can call their clients and give them a heads up instead of making them wait for food.  What made it worst was my child was very hungry and was freaking out :("}
{"text":"Unfortunate. There aren't any bento box for lunch here. Sushi is Average. Picture menu helpful."}
{"text":"Really great sushi for the value! Not to mention the service was impeccable. I've never met a more friendly and happy,  smiling server before. She greeted us and took us promptly to our table. We were given complimentary dumplings to start and our sushi and sashimi platter was really fresh and tasty. Thick generous portions, fresh fish. The smoked salmon sushi was unusual but awesome. End of the meal, we got a pack of pockys which was a really nice touch. Overall highly recommended! Four stars for food, +1 from  the service.   Good value, tasty, fresh fish, amazing service. Bam! Five star performance, bravo."}
{"text":"Very good appetizers (lobster taco, tatoyaki) and very yummy rolls (winter soldier). I have been here only once but would love to visit again."}
{"text":"Outstanding quality, fresh fish, generous portions, excellent value and best service both for dine in and take out."}
{"text":"I was in last night - and sadly was not thrilled this time around. Although the food once again was plentiful, the service was a let down.  My hubbys free starter - the deep fried Salmon Gyoza was presented - nothing for me... it was only after I said something that something came out - about 15 minutes later?   The BIG negative was at the end of the night - we were given our bill and quite literally we waited 15 minutes before they came around again to accept payment. There was nothing to indicate that we wanted to wait - we were sitting there. Keep in mind there were 2 servers and 3 tables of customers in the restaurant. What the heck was going on?  Also - the music is really loud and off putting in there - a bad Top 40 mix. Too loud and in my opinion brings the whole level of the place down. With so many things right about this place - its a shame that they kill the vibe with the trashy music.  I wont be back here for awhile."}
{"text":"I have been so happy since Li-Ao opened up in the NW.  I like their location in the South but it is just not worth the 37 minute drive from my house...   Li-Ao is not a fancy sushi restaurant nor are they authentic Japanese, but they do their food well and at reasonable prices.  Portions are generous.  The service has always been good (the owner Henry recognized our group from when we went to the South location) and since we go quite often, we've got to know a couple of their servers very well.  I can always rely on them for a quick, reasonably-priced sushi meal."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi, I always order from here and they always deliver quality. I live down in Copperfield with many options but always opt for driving out of the way for this place. Their Hot California Rolls are my favorite"}
{"text":"A great sushi option especially when you're in the deep SW south. They execute the usual rolls and sushi found in Calgary's sushi menu's w/ a few special items worth trying here and there!  Our service has always been great since there always appears to be adequate staff."}
{"text":"We were in the area around dinner time, so we opened our Yelp app to see what there is to eat in the vicinity.   This place was on the list so we gave it a try.  It is not a bad thing to have more sushi restaurant in this part of the city.  The sushi quality was around average mark for the city... it's nothing spectacular but on the other hand I have had worse sushi in town.  The rice on the sushi was a bit on the hard side and was not seasoned well... at least I can't taste the seasoning.  Since most sushi places get there fish from the same one or two fish supplier in the city, you are not going to find a lot of differences in the freshness of the fish (unless they gave you old fish that has been sitting around for a while).  It is the rice that makes the sushi and that is the thing that I found slightly lacking in quality.  Service was acceptable given how busy they were.  Overall, this is not a bad place if you are in the area and has a sushi crave."}
{"text":"Has anyone heard of Kinjo?  I remember years ago when the first Kinjo opened on MacLeod Trail- the owner of this restaurant was one of the chefs at Kinjo.  He quit and started this restaurant. Therefore, I find the menu to be much of the same. At the time he went and saw everything that was wrong with the Macleod Kinjo such as not enough table space. Having the sushi boats that took up a lot of room was a bad choice and he knew not to do that for his restaurant.  I just see it too much of a copy cat from Kinjo, unfortunately. So if I think it is like Kinjo but more expensive I might as well just go to Kinjo!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Service with a smile, modern décor, clean, open kitchen. Loved my first experience there and will be going back as a regular."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this location quite regularly. We live close by to this location, and we were a fan of Li-Ao (the loaction in the south) before they even opened, so we were very happy when they opened up in the NW!  We have had wonderful experiences every time we have been for a meal. We last visited in April, but generally visit around once a month. We have taken our friends, and even my parents when they visited from UK - and each time has been consistently great food & service.   The sushi/sashimi portions are generous, fresh and of great quality. They do a happy hour special after (I believe) 8.30pm and we have been allowed to substitute some of the rolls we are less keen on. We have been given gyozas (usually salmon) as a complimentary appetizer on every visit.  If you are not a fan of sushi, they have plentiful other options on the menu. They have a very relaxed atmosphere, but also family friendly. We went with a family member & his two year old daughter and the staff even cut a special orange for her (it looked like a carved pumpkin, but an orange) and she loved it.  Thank you again Li-Ao, as always - we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer here for a few years and not once have I been let down. It's a good environment for families, friends, and dates with the bae. Their sushi is always good, they're efficient and hella friendly as well.   S/o to Rainbow for always stepping up her game! She practically runs the joint and she's always smiling and always happy to serve."}
{"text":"I love this place exelent service fresh fish we got an airbnb near and there was the only place open i dont understand why everything close so early but any way great place and quality food but if they would open later they would of have all the business around"}
{"text":"I really like the recently-renovated Li-Ao, and it is honestly my favourite sushi place in town. While other sushi places may have similar quality, the value is incredibly impressive. So the quality of the food for the price is particularly good.   Their rolls are the best thing on the menu. I have a particular soft spot for their Dynamite rolls.   I also appreciate it when a sushi restaurant gives me Pocky sticks after my meal. This is what they always do."}
{"text":"Worst service ever in Calgary! I would have given them no star if I had this option. Very very bad customer service with an average Sushi. We don't live nearby but recommended by a friend and after reading the reviews (although the reviews were not great and I was worried about it) we decided to go and give this place a try. We were a group of 8 but had no issue getting a table and there was no wait time. We ordered many things including Sushi rolls, Sashimi, Salads, etc. The taste of the food, was just average, Edamame was OK but did not look fresh. We ordered a Crispy tuna sushi roll but when it was delivered, we noticed that it was deep fried. We told them that it was not mentioned on the menu but the waitress said the picture was showing that it was like that! Anyway, we told her we wanted this to be changed to a normal spicy tuna sushi roll. She took the plate but after 2 minutes the manager came back with the plate saying you want this to be cancelled? In a very rude voice. We said yes, then she said you already ate few of these! We said how we could see if we liked it or not without trying one or two? Anyway she replaced that with tuna roll ( at the end I give her at least credit for this) . When we wanted to order dessert and asked for the menu, the waitress said we don't have menu for dessert. We said how we can order then? She said you need to look at your back on the wall!!! Anyway, I turned back, looked at the wall, started reading for our party what was there on the menu!!! Never seen such a waitress. At the end after we signed the bill given a marker to sign, and when my friend told her that it was not a pen he was given, she grabbed the pen out of his hand saying no this is a pen and without any word she just left. I don't know if she had a bad day or what but I don't care about it and professional waitresses or waiters always put their customers as their priorities.  Will not recommend this place and will not go back for sure."}
{"text":"This place really is a hidden gem waaaaaay down south. We'd been at Spruce Meadows for an event and needed something quick to take the edge off before dinner in a few hours. Yelped it up, found this place and headed over.  It's nestled between the British Chippy and a Chinese restaurant. Quite open and airy, the staff are friendly. We got seated right away and had drinks brought promptly. Bonus points for a tea pot that doesn't spill/leak when you pour!   We were brought a complimentary sample of the tuna potstickers (I think that's what they were!), which were excellent. I'm not a huge fan of tuna but I really enjoyed it. We also ordered miso soup, a couple of slices of red tuna sashimi (nice and large for a good price) and a couple of rolls. Personally, I think the rice was lacking something, but otherwise really good sushi for a great price.   They did something reminiscent of another sushi restaurant in Calgary and gave us Pocky at the end of the meal (not one, but two!)  We didn't have any sake but I noticed that if you ordered the large (10oz) vs regular (5oz) there's actually a price break, whereas most places just charge double for the large size (and then it's like... why offer the \"large\" option at all?). They also have bubble tea, but only two flavours and it's the milk kind so I couldn't partake due to my dairy allergy.  All in all, if I were ever in the area I'd definitely make my way back down."}
{"text":"I've been to Li Ao in Nolan Hill a few times now, usually for the happy hour. We've had their regular menu a couple times too.   I found the rice to be hit or miss. It would be perfect and soft one visit, and hard the next. However, they're generous with their fish portions and the quality is great.   The service is inconsistent depending who you get. I don't know her name, but the main server who's usually there was always attentive. She was absent on our last visit and we noted the difference in service from the one who served us. They also tend to forget to include soy sauce and wasabi with any leftovers.   The food always comes out quick and hubby and I are almost always in and out within 45 minutes. They've adopted Kinjo's pocky treat model sans goofy acts thank God.   Li Ao is simple, and the only decent sushi choice within the deep NW. To be fair, both their SW and NW locations are in the middle of bumf*** nowhere extremities of Calgary but they're convenient for suburbanites. It's a 10 minute drive for me, so I will keep returning to satisfy my late night sushi cravings but I'd go to Zipang for a more substantial meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. By far the best place in south Calgary.  The good: -The portion sizes on sashimi are VERY generous -The staff are always friendly and the owner is always running around helping  -Significant free samples are given as an appetizer every time I have been there -They give each person a whole box of chocolate or strawberry Pocky after every meal -They are licensed and the sake they carry is excellent -Prices are competitive compared to even most grocery stores The bad: -Hard to get into/get a really fast delivery if you go during prime hours. This is just because of how crazy popular it is. Quick tip: Order the calamari. It is incredible. The tentacle bits are crispy, the rings and head thing are extremely tender, and the sauces are absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"I have been here soooo many times and have spent several special occasions here for birthdays and anniversaries. This sushi restaurant is my favourite to go to by far. The customer service is spectacular, food is phenomenal, and they are very reasonably priced. Everyone I know that has been to this restaurant also says the same. This is the best in Calgary by far.  I highly recommend trying their Male Dragon and Yam Tempura special rolls. They are fantastic."}
{"text":"The menu has good variety and quality. I always leave full and satisfied.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is welcoming and it is clean. The owners and staff are a friendly bunch.  You also get a choice of Pocky at the end of your meal. Bonus!  I like that they also offer delivery. Not usually common for restaurants. It's a good option to have."}
{"text":"We needed to grab lunch before heading out for a group hike. I stumbled upon Li-Ao Sushi, which had some good reviews and ratings so we decided to check them out on a late Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is located deep south (Bridlewood neighbourhood) in a random strip mall area but they make up for it with the sweetest staff and dirt cheap prices. Seriously, dirt cheap.  We were starved from not eating anything so we went to town on ordering. Li-Ao have a couple monthly specials (see chalkboard) while the rest of the menu is pretty standard Japanese fare.  What I don't get is how the front page lets you check off what you want but the back doesn't. So odd...easily fixable but I doubt it'll be changed. The staff are friendly, attentive and go above and beyond to please you (think that kind, endearing Japanese quality).  - 3x Green tea ($1.50 each) - standard fare. - Deep fried tuna gyozas - not many restaurants give you free appetizers to start your meal but Li-Ao do! They dropped these off while we were perusing the menu. Crispy fried outside, tasty inside. Good way to start our meal off!  - Negi toro roll (#49) ($2.95) and spicy salmon roll (#45) ($2.75) - belly tuna chopped with green onion for the negi toro roll. Salmon, cucumber and spicy sauce for the spicy salmon roll. Simple but good. - Avocado roll (#52) ($2.95), salmon roll (#54) ($2.95) and tuna roll (#55) ($2.95) - 6 pieces of avocado/sesame seeds, salmon and tuna. These were standard maki rolls. Nothing special but these were cheeeeeeeeeap. At least my sis can eat these without all the fancy drizzled sauces on top.  - Sunomono salad (#82) ($3.95) - a traditional Japanese vinegar salad with noodles. I think this is the first time I've had this. The octopus was fresh and the noodles were soaked in a sweet, soup style broth. - Seaweed salad (#84) ($4.95) - seaweed salad is always a winner in my books. Chewy, crunchy texture with each mouthful. I could eat this all the time. - Tempura yam (#90) ($4.25) - crisp yam, battered and fried. The tempura was light, not greasy and pretty reasonable for the price. - Tataki (#111) ($8.95) - briefly seared beef, sliced thinly and seasoned with ginger. We forgot to order this originally so we flagged our waitress down and had it near the end of our meal. Light, thinly sliced, tender beef with a sweet ponzu sauce. Good stuff.  - Assorted sashimi (#113) ($18.95) - 15 pieces of sashimi. You get six types of sashimi (salmon, tuna, scallops, tako, red snapper and red tuna) and egg (think they threw these in as extras). $18.95 for 15 pieces of sashimi is a GOOD deal. Everything tasted fresh and for the price, you can't really complain (too much). However, the salmon and tuna were cut quite thickly. If you're into quantity, you'll be a happy camper. My favourite were the scallops and tako. - Salmon mango roll (#63) ($9.95) - tempura shrimp, mayo, avocado, salmon and mango. Pretty standard fare roll wise. - King salmon crunch roll ($12.95) - this was one of their May special rolls. We tried ordering another of their specials (black cod) but they were already out of it so we went with the king salmon roll instead.  The waitress that served us was a real gem. She gave our whole group each a pack of Pocky at the end of our meal (I think she said they usually only give them out to girls). If you want a cheap place to grab sushi, check out Li-Ao Sushi!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our meal here.  I had the California rolls followed by the miso soup then the steak with rice and veggies.  Very flavourful. The steak was tender and the veggies were not over done.  The staff were very attentive and polite.   My only issue was the music which Ifound it was a bit too loud but that seems to be the new trend unfortunately.  Other then that, it was great and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for sushi, Li-Ao had a good rating so came here to try it. Strip mall, lots of parking, deep SW, lots of tables, not busy at all.  Service was great and prices were reasonable.  We were given a complimentary appetizer of fried wonton.  The Wonton wrapper wasn't particularly conducive to frying, however the sauce was great and for the price of free it can't be beat.  The hiyashi udon was on special.  Essentially a cold udon dish with tempura.  This dish is simple and perfect.  The portion was a bit small, but the udon was cooked perfectly (retains a good bite/bounce), the sweet and salty soy base had grated daikon which added freshness and the wasabi on the side added a great kick.  The tempura was crunchy and good as well, but the highlight were the udon noodles.  We also ordered the inside out combo (dynamite roll, california roll and volcano roll) and the winter soldier special roll.  The inside out combo was OK but nothing special.  The winter soldier roll was a mixed bag.  The sushi was great, especially the sauce and the scallop with the mayo.  However the salmon had an odd color and texture without the usual oiliness.  As other reviewers have mentioned, they give out free Pocky (chocolate or strawberry) after your meal which is definitely a plus.  Overall, good place for solid sushi in the SW at reasonable prices.  Will need to return to try sashimi at some point to determine fish quality."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food, extra star for the service. I wanted to love this place because it was so close to home but it just wasn't great.  I'm biased from traveling often for work and having access to great sushi across the east and west coast, so this may just be an affliction of Calgary sushi joints.   I would only go back if nothing else was available and I was really, really, really craving any sort of sushi."}
{"text":"Passed by the neighbourhood, very hungry and checked the review saying it's good, so my husband and I decided to try.   It's a very typical Chines sushi, not Japanese. Lack of plating and not elegant.  But the price was reasonable, food was um...just okay.  The waiter was nice, and the place gives ladies / kids a box of Pocky just like what the other Japanese restaurants do.   But the day I was there, the floor was sticky and bugs & flies were everywhere, and there was a bug actually landed on our sushi when we were eating!!!!! Gross!"}
{"text":"Super tasty, great prices and they offer complimentary samples of sushi. My new go to sushi place !"}
{"text":"I ordered today and they forgot to give Ginger or wasabi in my sushi! Sucks. Don't like carelessness."}
{"text":"Beyond impressed. Food was amazing and the atmosphere is upbeat. Service was great, the owner bounces around on every table checking on you. Back to the food, super diverse menu! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever. Hands down.  excellent service. The servers are extremely attentive. The sushi always tastes fresh. We live in the neighbourhood, and this is definitely our sushi \"go-to.\" Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and attentive. Prices are really good here, but don't let that make you think they cheap out. Rolls are super tasty with good rice consistency and amount. The sashimi was ok and that's the only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi & great service. We get takeout here and they tell us exactly when our food will be ready. We've never once had to wait and the staff here are always so friendly. They're very attentive to any special dietary restrictions & the sushi tastes fantastic! I also find their prices to be extremely reasonable. It's definitely worth the drive out!"}
{"text":"Henry, Rainbow !!! WE LOVE YOU !!! amazing customer service. My favorite sushi in Calgary by far. We are always greeted with GREAT BIG smiles. Love, love, love your positive vibes!!!  SEE YOU SOON !!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality sushi at decent prices.  Friendly service and owner was there and recognised my husband from a prior visit with his friends.  Started us off with free deep fried dumplings of sorts and actually removed the cali-rolls from the bill as his treat.    The menu has everything, and when I say everything I mean over a hundred items easy.  We stuck with some of our tried and true tempura, sushi and sashimi favourites and ventured off and tried some of their house special rolls and all were executed perfectly.    Place is immaculately clean, owner was super friendly, location is ideal for deep NW residents, top 40 music didn't bother me really (I like top 40 so its just personal preference), and love that everyone gets a free poky box after the meal. Only down side was there was no gluten free soy sauce so if you are watching your gluten consumption maybe bring your own bottle and the waitress was a bit slow in bringing us the bill so we just went to the till and Henry, the owner rang us up.  A solid 4.5, will definitely go back."}
