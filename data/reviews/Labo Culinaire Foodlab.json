{"text":"Saw an interview with the chef on thekitchn blog, which I love. I really liked the atmosphere and how you could watch the kitchen crew make the food right next to you. Went with my fiancé who is an adventurous eater. We had a shrimp dish that was excellent and very unique. He had a superbly cooked trout and I had the honey roasted quail. First time I ever had quail and it was incredible. I'm remembering the way the skin looked and tasted and wishing I had some now!

The service was great too. We only speak English and staff were very kind and helpful. 

I'd highly suggest trying this unique place."}
{"text":"L'endroit est génial. La bouffe est bonne mais le service est désagréable. Les serveurs sont toujours à la course, impossible de leur demander quelque chose. On m'a apporté le mauvais plat et je n'ai jamais réussit à le retourner."}
{"text":"Finally somewhere awesome to eat and hang in the somewhat seedy area of St Laurent and St Catherine's. Located in the SAT (upstairs), the Food Lab is innovative, interesting, laid back and as sharp as its location. Able to experiment, create themes, the wonderfully run open kitchen is amazing. And affordable. I was there during the Japanese Izakaya theme, and shared most of the plates, though you want to get your own - because portions are great for one, and you won't want to share once you put what they got in your face. 

So, we started with the homemade silken tofu app - with chili oil and nori that melts in your mouth. Alongside this was the insanely amazing shitake salad with succulent dried persimmon. For a main we both went with the rice bol - with not fried, but  baked (and still tasted like crackling) chicken skin, a poached egg, seaweed and braised pork. Come on people. Pure flavour overload. 

After that - because we needed to try more - we backtracked to the apps again to go after the dashi. Seafood, in a beautiful little broth. Hard to share, as we both wanted to stick our faces into it. 

And with 2 good wine recomms, this was a hit in my stomach. Very laid back, you order at the counter, the chefs serve you, and you leave wonderfully satisfied after a little taste of divinity. 

So go."}
{"text":"At the top floor of the S.A.T. an open area, industrial looking fun place. The menu is simple, with an interesting choice of cocktails and wine. Very friendly ambiance for a quick meal. Nothing special about the food, but it's well prepared. Good choice for the price if you are in the area. Beautiful terrace for the summer, and the drinks are original. I recommend for a drink and a small bite."}
{"text":"Friday I finally tried LABO, I knew of it before it opened and have been unlucky in the only time I came upon it while it was open was right after I'd had dinner. The subsequent visits there were closed due to private functions.

I was not disappointed. 

I found that the menu under sells the food. The Braised Lamb shoulder sandwich with raquette, grape tomato, spanish onion and fresh herbs is more of a pizza than sandwich. You couldn't get fresher flat bread as it is grilled just prior to the composition of the open-faced sandwich.

This evening's theme was Summer in Southern Italy - true to this - the ingredients were fresh & of the finest quality.

The have a reasonably selection of wines by the glass.

For dessert the Strawberries and Whipped Ricotta was more; yes there were Quebec strawberries, small raspberries and blackberries with ricotta but they sat on a golden Olive Oil cake (prepared with Semolina giving it an almost nutty texture).

The presentation of the plates equaled the flavour of the plates - the eyes feasted as well.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Toujours très curieuse, j'ai apprécié mon expérience au foodlab. L'entrée était succulente, le plat aussi, mais adorant les épices, je crois que j'aurais dû sélectionner quelque chose de plus relever. Je dois avouer que les bettraves avaient un petit goût amère que j'ai trouvé particulier."}
{"text":"Went with a good friend of mine sometime in September.  We were sitting on a shared table on the rooftop.  Quite a nice place, and we ended-up with some interesting table-mates.  We picked a few appetizers to share and got some very nice drinks that were on the happy hour list.

Nice place, can be a lot of fun, but not for a first date."}
{"text":"The Spot:
Way up on the top floor of Montreal's Société des arts technologiques (best known by locals as the SAT), you'll find Labo Culinaire or for us anglos, Foodlab.
The concept revolves around having an experimental and adventurous approach to food. The space is very modern and inviting, featuring an open kitchen where patrons can see chef-duo (and the restaurant's two owners) Michelle Marek and Seth Gabrielse work their magic behind the stove.

In the summer, the space expands to include an impressive roof-top terrace where spots are handed out on a first-come-first-served basis. With large tables, a lounge area and giant sun umbrellas the area is at once open but nonetheless cozy. The space accommodate large groups quite well and there is enough (friendly) staff that you always feel well attended to.

What's Really Good:
SAT Foodlab caught our eye for two major reasons:
(1) Menu is constantly changing. Every couple of weeks there is a new culinary theme. Since the restaurant's opening this past January, the menu has featured inspiration from Japanese, Lebanese, Turkish, Spanish, Greek and Italian cuisine to name a few. Other sources of inspiration include specific ingredients and experiences which has so far included winemaking, smorgasbords, maple syrup and pork.
Special limited edition menus have also been known to charm Foodlab patrons, who can expect to have their taste buds teased during particular events and holidays. One more reason to stay tuned-in to their twitter and facebook pages.

(2) Fixed menu + wine pairings. Although you can choose to order some (or all) of the dishes offered - usually this is limited to less than 10 choices - you can also take advantage of their \"menu fixe\". This table d'hôte includes an appetizer, a main course, a dessert and two wine pairings and will cost you between $35 and $45. While the moderate price is enticing, don't expect copious amounts of food. Each dish is modest in size, a generous tapas.

We Were There:
When we stopped by, the theme at the Foodlab happened to be revolving around Italy. We opted for the fixed menu, starting with a delicious orange wine, fresh ricotta and swiss chard. Lovely, and so very summery.

Next we moved on to the grilled sausage with rapini, and a glass of Contadino. While we adored the simplicity of the dish, the plate was lacking where contrasting flavour and texture were concerned.

To finish our meal we enjoyed the stone fruit tart. Overall the tart itself was wonderfully light. The crust was just perfect and the filling of peach, apricot, sour cherries and almonds, topped with a dollop of crème fraiche was very tasty. We couldn't have been more happy with this stunning desert. It was perfectly appropriate for the summer evening we spent at the restaurant.

Foodlab certainly gets a gold star for their unique and very subtle approach to Italian food - it's not what most people would expect, but it certainly surprised us in the best possible way. We're already looking forward to checking out their take on the next themed menu.

Verdict:
Definitely worth checking out. The Foodlab is a great spot to meet a friend afterwork, or bring a date and enjoy a few glasses of wine with a light meal."}
{"text":"Overall, pretty good. The parsnip soup and mezze platter along with our entrees were very good. I wouldn't say it's the best place we ate in Montreal (and certainly not the most cozy) but it was gooo"}
{"text":"Nice place, fun vibes, you're here for the view, right?! The food and service are good, too."}
{"text":"Personnel sympathique. Entrée de radis excellente, tout comme les moules fumées. nous allons revenir!"}
{"text":"When I was researching top restaurants in Montreal for 2014, this place came up as number one. This restaurant is tucked away on the busy street of St Laurent Boulevard. Its located on the 2nd floor of a build with no visible sign.

Once you climb the stairs, you'll see the small and intimate setting they've set up. Decorated with Christmas lights to add to the romantic atmosphere, it provides the perfect ambiance for a date night or a small get together. The open setting allows you watch the chefs work in their small open concept kitchen. The patio offers a great view of Montreal while you enjoy the amazing meal ahead. 

The restaurant offers a seasonal rotational menu, and it will change after a few months. During my visit, I was there for the Czech Republic menu. All the items were delicious and well balanced and full of flavor. Best of all, this restaurant is one of the least expensive places I've been for a great meal! Toronto included. 

After coming, its easy to see why this restaurant rated as number one on the top 2014 list. I hope to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Très bel endroit lorsqu'arrivent les beaux jours.
Une des meilleurs terrasses ouverte de Montreal.
Arrivez tot si vous souhaitez avoir de la place, passez 18h, vous aurez bien du mal à trouver une place de libre en extérieur.
Les prix sont les memes qu'ailleurs sauf pour la nourriture, plus couteux qu'ailleurs avec des quantités plus réduites. Mais c'est le prix pour profiter du cadre :)"}
{"text":"Labo is located up the stairs within a building that we can only assume as artists/ tech studio.
Staff was friendly and explained that the restaurant also hosts many launches and private functions. We caught a glimpse of the private function area, and immediately knew that this place takes amazing transformations throughout the year.
The restaurant had bar area, open kitchen, and a beautiful balcony area.
We enjoyed our meal thoroughly, the restaurant's hip vibe was nice, and our antipasti had just the right mix and balance."}
{"text":"Ah! I reviewed the Food Lab on the main SAT listing! Which is ok because it gives me a chance to write more about how much I love this place! A lot of the reviews here describe what happens during a huge event, and that's legitimate, but absolutely not reflective of a regular evening at this lovely spot. 

At the top floor of the Societe des Arts Technologique in a wide open space with a wide open kitchen and wide open terrasse, this is a space where you can eat fresh new menu items each month on a theme, and you can see all the beautiful people making and serving beautiful things. The head chef here is a woman, and a tough and wildly cool one at that, and she makes food that is deceptively simple and super super delicious. Come with a group and try everything. They work with private importers for wine lists tailored to each menu.

I don't want to describe the many wonderful things I have eaten here because the menu is sure to be different, but suffice to say, this is one of my favourite romantic drink and bite places in the summer, and sparkly spots to feel outside of time at any time of year."}
{"text":"Pas mal, mais j'ai connu mieux, principalement au niveau du service avec les 10 serveurs qui ne savent pas vraiment s'attribuer des tables, néanmoins sympathiques, parfois un peu négligés, service à revoir donc...
Niveau bouffe, le Foodlab propose des grillades de tout sauf de viande donc amateurs de buf et poulet, s'abstenir. Les \"pizzas\" sont faciles à partager pour l'apéro, originales et bonnes, les autres plats semblaient appétissants par contre un peu cher pour 4 fruits de mer...
La sangria à essayer! À première vue le petit bocal ne justifie pas son prix pourtant la teneur en alcool vous fera dire le contraire.
Côté décor, c'est plutôt simple, on sent un alignement vers le lounge sans y toucher vraiment, et pour le moment la terrasse n'offre pas sa meilleure vue en raison des travaux alentours, le charme montréalais du moment vous me direz."}
{"text":"My partner and I tried Foodlab's Mongolian inspired menu this week and had a great experience.  Although I don't think authenticity is a top concern, I loved the bold flavours as well as discovering new ingredients and combinations.  The service was very professional and attentive.  A really great experience overall!"}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday for CultMTL's birthday party, so the options were limited. But they had a bunch of sandwiches/sald. I tried the pulled pork (super yummy) and my wife tried the vegetarian which she really liked.

It's a cool spot, though yesterday was very crowded. I'd be intrigued to visit again though. Yummy food, rooftop, and beer, are all yes yes yes to me."}
{"text":"The food lab is located on the third floor of the Société des Arts Technologies Building (SAT) on St-Laurent street. From June until the end of summer, the first Monday of each month will be dedicated to food photography with the #Flashlab evenings. These events allow foodies to live a different experience each time while getting to meet other Montreal instagrammers. I came here for my first flashlab event this past month, since one of my friends was hosting the event. It was a lovely discovery. They have a beautiful, big, dining room, christmas lights hanging from the ceiling, an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs cook and a quite large open terrace on the rooftop to enjoy during summer. Their previous chef left a week before the event, so it was an entirely new menu made by their new chef, Adrien Renaud. Since I already had a separate dinner planned, the three of us there decided to get the Mezze Platter for 4 to share, it cost 28$. Everything was good but the portions were more for two people rather than 4. I also had one of their white natural wines and it was surprisingly good. They cook with local ingredients, which is why they have a changing seasonal menu and work with private importers for their natural wines. The service was excellent and the ambiance, top notch. 

It's a great place to bring a date or to have a drink with your friends even if it's a bit pricey. 

For the event, they also had 2 prizes you could win. The first one was a dinner for two worth 80$ and the second one was a bottle of natural wine. All you had to do to get a chance to win was take a picture, tag the restaurant and post it on instagram with #flashlab."}
{"text":"Localisé au dernier étage de la SAT (Société des arts technologiques) dans le Quartier des Spectacles, le Labo culinaire/Foodlab est une belle place mais ce qui fait sa force sont sa bouffe et sa terrasse, un must ici et une des meilleures à Montréal, à mon avis. J'y viens depuis plusieurs années. Parfait pour un 5@7, un verre en amoureux ou avec une date sur sa terrasse pendant une belle soirée d'été. Le Labo culinaire/Foodlab à un nouveau chef, Adrien Renaud, depuis quelques semaines. Il propose plusieurs produits du Québec sur son menu. J'y été avec ma copine et des amis. On a pris l'assiette de mezze pour 4 (28$), mais à mon avis, c'était plutôt pour 2 que pour 4 personnes, donc un peu maigre pour 4 et un peu cher pour ce que c'est. Ils proposent du vin, cocktails mais aussi des bières biologiques de la Brasserie Beau's (Vankleek Hill/Ontario). Service rapide. Prix un peu cher. Je reviendrai encore ici car j'aime l'ambiance et leur terrasse durant la saison estivale.

4/5 visité en juillet 2016"}
{"text":"Stopped in Thursday night around 9:30. Service was great. Food and wine off the charts. I do wish they had a little bigger selection of wines by the glass. However, my wine was very good. We also had the venison tartare that my wife selected which was very odd because she doesn't really like it. But I had to fight her off the tartare as it might of been the best ever. Wish we had more room in our stomachs. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I saw this place in a You Tube video that showed some of the coolest restaurants and bars in Montreal. We chose to go on a warm, sunny day because they have a large roof terrace. The outside area wasn't really special and doesn't offer a great view but unfortunately that wasn't the only disappointment. The service ruined the evening for us. After a little wait, we were seated but then they didn't take our order for a long time. Once we had asked for two drinks and one sharing platter (because the main dishes were too expensive for a normal person), we waited and waited and waited... after about half an hour we got our ginger ale and caipirinha. Although we drank those very slowly, by the time our flat bread with tomato and mozzarella finally arrived, only ice cube water was left. As we had awaited our food for over an hour, it was gone within seconds. It was a delicious, carefully prepared little pizzaesque dish but it couldn't really make up for the wait. We ordered the bill, did not leave any tip (something we'd never done before), and left quite unhappily."}
{"text":"Pour un bon verre de vin ou une bière avec des petites bouchées qui fondront dans votre bouche, le FoodLab est un super bel endroit pour un 5 à 7. J'ai fait l'expérience du FoodLab deux soirées de suite. La première lors d'un 5 à 7 à leur emplacement permanent au 3e étage de la SAT (Société des Arts Technologiques). J'ai adoré le décor, l'espace ouvert et l'éclairage naturel. Je ne sais pas s'ils ouvrent la terrasse quand il fait plus chaud mais je l'espère car elle est assez spacieuse et qui n'aime pas une belle terrasse en été? La deuxième fois que j'en ai fait l'expérience, c'était lors d'un événement ailleurs où l'on pouvait se procurer des petites bouchées (presque comme des tapas) à un bon prix. La prochaine fois que je les vois à un festival, une conférence, ou même sur le bord de la rue pour les journées \"Le marché du FoodLab, c'est garanti que je m'y arrête pour au moins m'y prendre une collation!"}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this place only 2 stars, but I had a really awful meal here on Friday evening and my date and I left severely disappointed. I had been here once before and knew that the theme rotated and that the menu could be somewhat restricted and was fine with that. One this evening, it was poached salmon with some vegetables as part of the prix fixe. 

The starter soup was ok, nothing special. The main course was the poached salmon. It arrived wrapped in parchment paper with some overcooked potatoes on the side. The salmon itself was extremely bland and undercooked. The only saving grace of this meal was the wine pairing and the dessert.

To add to our disappointment, we ordered a latte to go with dessert and it arrived room temperature at best. I love the concept of this place, the venue, the prices and how friendly everyone is, but I could have made that salmon at home and it would have been better."}
{"text":"At the terrasse opening party, I lined up 20 min for a drink, and the waiter literally threw the menu on our table after sitting there for about 1 hour. Then we waited another 30min to get someone to order, then another 1 hour to get the food on the table. We swallowed our meal in 5 min because we were so hungry and the waiter came back right away to ask for the bill - so efficient this time!  
I feel I will be a shameless hipster if i come back again but the video projection, the DJs and the space is just so unique and amazing!  It will be a pity if it cannot keeps up the standard... I hope the owner can fix the problem before their next terrasse party ( ps: 2 of my coworkers told me they had bad service there, too. I guess i am not alone)."}
