{"text":"My  boyfriend is obsessed with the pho. I did not care for the Boba smoothie, but could have just been me.. I've never had it anywhere. I did like the spring rolls alot and felt they were a good price for the size. The service was fine. I would like to try take out sometime! I like their location in Goodyear but this one is much bigger/fancier, the other one is nice for a quick lunch spot."}
{"text":"Great service. The Pho and the fried rice dish were perfect. Prices are super reasonable. Place is really clean and comfortable. We would make this a regular stop if we lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Recently tried this place out; however, I'm 50/50 on this place. 

First, this review is specific to take-out so I can't speak to the dining-in experience, which a lot of people seem to have enjoyed (see other reviews). 

Second, the food tasted great. I have absolutely no complaints about taste. I ordered a variety of stuff and it all tasted great. 

Third, the issue came with price and portions. The food was extremely pricey given the portions I received. This was to the extent that I thought I didn't receive all of my food. Additionally, the portions of the proteins (e.g., chicken) for my meals were extremely small. For example, the chicken fried rice was almost entirely just rice. I enjoyed the scavenger hunt for the missing chicken, but I ultimately felt like I overpaid for what I got. 

Overall, this place makes some great tasting food. However, from my experience, it's pricey for what I received. I may re-try this place in the future, but my experience left me wanting to look elsewhere the next time I want some good Asian cuisine. If your are going to give this place a try, I may recommend dining in. The reviews for dining in seem to be excellent and that may be what I do in the future."}
{"text":"Great pho!  Love this soup and their's has been consistently good.  Haven't ordered anything else; can't get past the pho."}
{"text":"I read all the hype and had to go get some pho. Staff was awesome food amazing. I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice. Amazing wait-staff, and delicious food! Bahn mi sandwiches are not quite authentic as they do not have the traditional \"meat paste\" that the Vietnamese classically do. I got the vermicelli rice bowl with lemongrass tofu & veggies - it was amazing! Came with a side of cold fish sauce... didn't enjoy that much, only took a few spoonfuls & decided I didn't like it. The second time, we both ordered pho. It is the best bowl of pho in the local area of Surprise. Very hearty, very delicious, and lots of options for variations (vegetarian options and broths offered & readily available). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is some great tasting food. Not over done, just the right balance of flavor. The staff is polite and attentive. One of our servers Kayla, is super sweet and cute. Always approached us with a smile. It's very clean and relaxing. I love the birthday song they play. Just wish they had a soda fountain with with bottomless drinks. Sodas come in a can. you have to pay for each can."}
{"text":"It was new and very busy and they were very overwhelmed but other than falling a little behind they pulled thru it. The food was very good a lot of it I had plenty to take home.we ordered a couple of different things I'm not a fan of how the beef was cooked but it tasted fine everything was good and what we ordered I will definitely go back and as I always do try more different things on the menu. And I would not hesitate to order the same thing again I can not remember what it was called the price was reasonable. .. will be back"}
{"text":"This place has the best Vietnamese food in surprise. I'm one of those whose very picky on Vietnamese food since I make them majority of the time. But those days when we just want to eat out, we could never find a good Vietnamese restaurant until we tried PT.  Love it. The service was great. The portion was good and price was reasonable. Quality of the food was the best in surprise.  None of the Vietnamese restaurants in surprise can compare.  If anybody like pho or fried rice, you have to try it here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love PT noodles, I always get the vegetarian pho and am never disappointed! I only wish I discovered them sooner"}
{"text":"This is the one year anniversary of the Surprise location. We have become frequent customers. The food is consistently fresh and high quality. The service only gets better. Tien chose beautiful uniforms for the staff that contributes to the beauty and authenticity of the experience. He recently absorbed the space to the Left and has doubled the space. The decorative objects are delightful. This is a restaurant that is deeply invested in and it shows from the smallest detail of the custom designed menus to the boba tea."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite!! I ate my food too
Fast so I took a pic of myself. The staff and food is amazing. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"My family visited me from Fountain Valley Ca. They live near little Saigon. Some of the best Asian food in the US. We were delighted with delicious food that made us all happy. They are so picky, and no complaints. I recommend this place because of excellence."}
{"text":"We are new to Surprise and just stopped in to check it out.  Our expectations for this restaurant were blown out of the water!  Excellent service, immaculately clean and Pho to die for!!!! Very impressed, we will definitely be making this a regular!  Check it out, we highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why we keep giving this place chances. Had a drink spilled on by one of the waiters, he was trading so I didn't give him a hard time. Another time we went we ordered a meal for my wife with no cucumbers (she has an allergy) and guess what, there were cucumbers. This last time I ordered the tip steak skillet with the egg, the skillet came out cold (not sizzling) and the egg was not cooked AT ALL, we brought it to the attention of the wait staff and they took the egg away and brought back another over-hard, by this time my food was cold (the rest of the party was served at least 10 minutes before me) and the egg was not able to blended into the meal like it should be, I took maybe two bites and the steak was heavily over cooked. Any other resturaunt would come the food when they mess up and the customer doesn't eat it nor take it home. Maybe I'm the idiot for continuing to go back but you can bet I won't ever again! THIS PLACE STINKS!"}
{"text":"Definitely a top 5 restaurant that I've ever had the pleasure of sitting down and eating at. Great for date night. The food was absolutely heavenly. The staff were very friendly. I asked for our waitresses best suggestions (because I've never visited before) and wow... it'll make me come back and spend money again and again. And to top it all off, we decided to get smoothies and they were AMAZING!
Best prices in town for the best food. Very happy."}
{"text":"We've been to other Vietnamese restaurants around Surprise and as much as we enjoy them we were anxious to try PT Noodles and so glad that we did.  We shared 2 appetizers, calamari and egg rolls and both were excellent. Entrees included, Vegetarian Pho, barbecue chicken with rice, a combination plate that included samples of pork chop, beef, shrimp etc. and a pork and shrimp crepe. The menu had many options to pick from and the pictures on the menu helps if one is not familiar with Vietnamese food. The service was excellent and the staff could not do enough for us. Tien, the owner was making sure all tables and customers were being taken care of and Vy our server was great! We definitely look forward to returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have 7 documented check-ins for this location of PT Noodles, but I have probably been there many more times and forgot to check in. When we first started going, they service was fantastic, but it has been declining on a steady pace since then. On one occasion it was like pulling teeth to get our bill. I even pushed the call button to no avail. We finally flagged down a waitress 5 minutes later and got our bill.  Why have call buttons if you aren't going to utilize them. On another occasion the waiter (which I believe is the manager) failed to bring silverware, when we got his attention, he brought us over a little silverware box from another table - how do we know that the people at that table didn't fondle them?? Plus, the table had to be wiped down - the cloth he used to wipe the table down with smelled so bad the smell lasted our entire time there, and he didn't wipe the whole table leaving dried up sauce all over the place. Finally, on our last visit they were closing early to have an employee celebration. Fine. No problem. We had a half an hour to get our food and eat. The table was dirty, and again the manager wiped down the table with a cloth that smelled terrible. Then we noticed there wasn't any soy sauce or chili paste that is a condiment on every table. We asked for these items. Finally, after 15 minutes of not receiving the condiments I took them from another table. To add to our disappointment, the manager kept coming to our table to remind us that they were closing early - yeah, we heard you the first 5 times you told us. I don't know why the service is declining... perhaps they grew so quickly that they need more staff?? I will give them one more try, but if the service continues as it is, I will stop going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"2 stars means \"Meh. I've experienced better\"  and I have had better: at PT Noodles Goodyear!

My soup was weak and the service was not good.  I wouldn't mind but there were plenty of servers and I know they are experienced because I've seen them at the Goodyear location.

I will most likely give them another shot because I know they just opened this location, but I hope they didn't change their flavors (and raise their prices) to become more like other fusion places."}
{"text":"Great service, fabulous food. Staff is friendly ALWAYS. We ordered 15a and 16c. Couldn't leave without Vietnamese coffee. 
The first time we went we had pho, delicious also.
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love the Surprise location as a quick, but decent spot for dinner. Haven't been to the other location. All of the appetizers are delicious, in my opinion. I think I love the fried shrimp appy or garlic wings the most. We have also tried the fried noodle dishes, various pho options, and the house/combo fried rice, and they were all very decent quality. It is just a hair pricier than most places, not much, but some. If you can get over that, it's a very convenient, nice place to stop by if you're in Surprise, AZ. The staff are all SUPER nice and accommodating as well."}
{"text":"I met a friend here who had never heard of Pho.   She is a fan now.  We both had the rare steak and meatball Pho.   She really went to town by adding hot chili oil and all he extras.   Your Pho tastes like magic.   It's sweet and savory all at once. I would like to have some Pho keurig pods just so I can have a mug full whenever I want."}
{"text":"They were very disorganized. They couldn't get our child's order straight. They neglected her needs and didn't bring forks. The food was good but the service sucked!!!!!!!!!!  I suggest you learn patience when dealing with this place.  We waited 20 mins at lunch to get food. The soup came out after the plated lunches. Can't imagine what a fiasco dinner would be. 
Once the kitchen manager realized that things were off he more than made up for it. He is a very gracious person who truly cares about the customer. The food is amazing and lots of it. 
Enjoy the ambience it is great!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! What a great Vietnamese Restaurant! Wonderful service, thanks, Hanna! My husband had Special Pho Soup, delicious! We shared spring rolls, large rolls and sauce was good. I had Rice noodles with chicken, could not finish it all, but very tasty! Large portions, reasonable prices, nice staff! One suggestion, upgrade your wine list."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food, it's my favorite so I was excited to finally try this restaurant out. I got seated right away and was there for over 20 minutes before I even got greeted, as a matter of fact I didn't even get greeted. I had to call over a server and ask when I would get service. He apologized along with the manager but kept trying to place blame on someone in the restaurant (ie one of the cooks in the back who sat us and didn't tell anyone he sat us) now mind you it wasn't super busy and I was getting passed by employees often. They ended up telling me they have buttons I could of pushed for service but clearly wouldn't have known that as a first time customer who never was advised of this. Well I have a toddler who requested noodles so instead of a kids dish(which didn't have noodles I asked for garlic noodles or noodles we saw in a picture) everyone kept insisting they couldn't do those as a side dish so I said it was fine to have plain egg noodles. They did end up bringing out fried noodles which was delicious. I also tried ordering from the manager a jelly drink for my toddler and he said he couldn't because my toddler could choke. So I unfortunately won't be back because of this whole experience but the food was good and the people are nice I just didn't have a good first impression."}
{"text":"My 1 star isn't on the food because I haven't even had a chance to try them yet. I'm sure they are good. And I can't wait to give them a try and It's not so much on the service either. It's on that they are opened till 9 and I go in at 8:30 and they tell me they are closed. And I said \"aren't you opened till 9?\" The girl then says \"yes but our kitchen closes at 8:30.\" I have worked/owned restaurants before and I completely understand when a customer comes in minutes before you close and wants to order takeout or even dine in.....but if your sign/menu says you are opened till 9 then don't turn ppl away! It's not a bar! It's a restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with the wife... Very impressed with the decor, And this was the first restaurant that I have seen a call button for your wait Service... What an ingenious idea, calling somebody when you need them versus looking around wondering if somebody's going to come serve you! Great start! Was greeted promptly at the door and was given as much time as we needed because of the call button... We ordered a Bahn Mi barbecue pork sandwich, order of rice paper shrimp rolls, and curry beef with vegetables... They started out with this simple but exquisite chicken broth soup that was so good our waiter Jerome asked if I wanted seconds... Could not resist second serving... The food came out very promptly started with the shrimp rolls which are pretty much like everywhere else except the shrimp is cut horizontally so you don't get a whole shrimp with each bite, The peanut sauce was tasty... The sandwich was very good and had adequate vegetables as a nice complement... The highlight for me was the curry beef... The broth was so tasty I could've eaten as a soup... It is served with either bread or rice we went with the rice... After the meal my wife and I discussed our ratings we both gave it 4 1/2 stars... Our waiter was a nice young man Jerome and he could not have been more gracious... We will be back!"}
{"text":"Husband and I have been coming to the Surprise location for two winters (snowbirds).  Since we first discovered it, we have been faithful customers.  The food is consistently excellent.  But, what we enjoy almost as much as the food is the efficient, friendly, warm, waitstaff.  It's obvious they have been trained well in customer service.  When they are not waiting tables, they are busy cleaning and performing other tasks.  The restaurant is spotlessly clean.  Last but not least, we want to acknowledge and thank Steven, the manager, who always takes time to greet us and makes every visit a pleasure.  Wish more restaurants were this welcoming."}
{"text":"Second visit in one month.  The place was very busy.  The service was slow The Spring roll was good as usual but arrived with the meal.  The chicken Pho was bland.  Also ordered the fried rice dish with chicken, shrimp and beef for $11.  The peas and carrots were not fresh, they were from a frozen state.  There were 2 shrimp, tiny pieces of chicken and even less beef.  The rice was delicious but I was disappointed  with the other contents.  The verdict is out if we will return."}
{"text":"Im very happy to have another vietnamese restaurant in surprise. The pho is tasty and the service is wonderful which is very important to me as a customer.  I love the clean and asian decor too. I highly recommend PT Noodles for a nice lunch, dinner with friends and family."}
{"text":"Our family was so excited to see PT in our neighborhood!!! From the first visit right after opening, to the many visits since, PT has become one of our favorite local places to eat!!! Whether the restaurant is packed, or we are one of 3 tables seated, we are treated like royalty!! And the food is AMAZING! From Pho, fried rice, or any entree we have tried, the chefs have always delivered a great meal!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!! I was very surprised to find a Pho place of this quality here in little old Surprise. The ambiance is top notch as is the service and the cleanliness (yes, they do clean off the salt and pepper shakers! Many places don't, like Native across the street).

Love it!!"}
{"text":"It's best to come here at non-peak hours 'cuz it' not a huge place.  The place is pretty small but the food is pretty good for the area.  I've had delicious pho and meh pho ... this place is just above the middle for me.  Definitely a place to try out if you are in the area but not really worth a 2 hour drive or anything like that."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to PT Noodles.  I was with a party of three so I had the chance to see and taste several entrees.  The food was very good.  Everything was fresh from the rice, noodles and vegetables.  Service was  prompt and attentive.  The ambience was simple but well presented.  It was a bit more pricier than peer VN restaurants, but it was a good experience and you won't be disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"First time there and absolutely loved in definitely going back very soon place was nice and clean great customer service I have no negative reviews for this place I absolutely love it , this will definitely be my go-to for pho ."}
{"text":"If you love pho you'll love this place! Nice environment plus very clean and responsive staff. Never disappointed"}
{"text":"Amazing experience the food is tasty and good portions the fried shrimp delicious and jumbo shrimp juicy very clean and music not too loud and good music current music love the atmosphere but most of all the price is affordable"}
{"text":"it doesn't get any better than noodles.  the soda dispenser is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"The last meal my wife and I
     ate at this location
is the last meal my wife and I 
will ever seek at this location.

THIS LOCATION HAS MAJOR CONSISTENCY ISSUES.

I am extremely glad to see there are 2 other Westside locations!!
...15 minute drive as opposed to 10 minutes...should be well worth it. They (can) put together a helluva Pho!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best peanut sauce with spring rolls! Wonderful service and atmosphere! Clean."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the cleanliness and simple elegance of the decor. The staff seemed excited to help (easy on the eyes) since it was my first time there.  I had our food to go since we were visiting from out of town and ha out little drippy with us in the vehicle. When we arrived back to our hotel and unpack the food, it was what I expected fresh ingredients wrapped in cellophane and very organized. The food was on amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"Found PT Noodles 3-4 weeks ago and have been back once or twice every weekend since. The place is immaculate, wait staff is eager to help, although a little overwhelmed sometimes. Management tries to take good care of you. The food is super good, I always get the stir fry with rice noodles, the flavor is so good. Friends get the Pho and go crazy over how good, also the beef fried rice. Sis-in-law got the chicken fried rice and enjoyed (even though she didn't want to go). The broth they serve as the soup is so fresh and rich tasting, hard to describe. Headed over there now!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Combo fried rice was great, good portion size.  Fried egg roll was basic.  Interior is nice, pleasant. Busy in here, but enough seats. Will come again if in area again."}
{"text":"Good to have another Vietnamese restaurant close by for comparison.  This place has great atmosphere and prices are not hard on the wallet. The food is authentic and they have Boba."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, friendly and knowledgeable staff, really good food. It's not a take-out spot (although I'm sure you can order for pickup)--it's a sit down restaurant. The BEST item was the shrimp spring rolls--yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The Pho is out of control! I braved the Cambodian bowl, and thoroughly enjoyed the fried rice with chicken, shrimp, and steak, and their ribeye plate with fried rice makes my mouth water thinking about it (pic). Very reasonably priced, as nearly every dinner dish on the menu is under $12. If you want something high end they have a Lobster plate and a Lobster soup, multiple cuts of steak, and you can even order a burner plate for two or four and cook your own scallops, shrimp, pork, beef, and lamb. The food sometimes takes a little while, but the place is so nice and quiet that we just never go when we are rushed. Take your time and study their huge menu and you will never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Lots of food on the menu, I have tried quite a bit of it. Most is ave or slightly above. My biggest problem with this place is how long it takes to get your food.  The staff is usually attentive.  I only get an hour for lunch, and that isn't enough time.  Place is very clean.  Surprise is lacking for places to eat, and this place is a welcome addition."}
{"text":"After moving to Surprise I was worried I wouldn't find a place to eat pho that would be as good as the ones I've had before. So glad I tried PT Noodles! Their pho is delicious with a clean and flavorful broth. The portions are huge! Very generous for the price. One bowl of pho would probably make 2 or 3 meals for me. I always have leftovers. I also have to recommend the chicken fried rice! Some of the best I've ever had! I'm also addicted to the mango smoothie with boba! I have to get one every time I go. I haven't had many of the other dishes yet but I definitely hope to try more in the future!

As for the service, everyone is amazing and genuinely friendly. They showed us how to use the call button at the booth and they are very prompt at responding. I've dined in multiple times as well as ordered take out. For take out, the pho comes deconstructed with the broth and ingredients separated so it doesn't get soggy. 

If you're looking to get a pho fix, I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"This was a true disapointment, since we just moved to the area from California, and  was hoping to find a \"go to\" Vietnamese  restaurant.  First off, I ordered a cabbage salad with chicken with dressing on the side. The young man said that they could not do that since \"it says it's a salad, but it's really not.\"  I subsequently ordered bun without noodles...that was actually o.k, but most restaurants will add lots of veggies instead...they skimped on the veggies. Our appetizer of fresh spring rolls came halfway into our dinner and we subsequently cancelled the order. A few minutes later, the server came to the table with an order of  fried egg rolls and told us \"they are on the house.\"  I think this was an order someone didn't want and the server didn't know what to do with it so they offered it to us....We told him we ordered fresh spring rolls as we don't eat fried food.....My husband had to get his own fork and we had to ask for the check.....overall, this was absolutely atrocious.  .....definitely would not recommend......."}
{"text":"I'm so glad a Vietnamese place has opened pretty close to our house. We came here and ordered beef pho and a chicken/beef/shrimp egg fried noodle dish. My husband and I shared both entrees. Both dishes tasted good, I just wish for $10 the pho would come with a couple of egg rolls or spring rolls. I felt the pho was a bit overpriced for what it is.

The service was pretty good other than a blip in the beginning, we were seated with no menus and waited quite a while for a waitress to notice us sitting there. The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty nice, especially for a date night. It's quiet and private, just what I like after a day at work.

Also I love that their hours are later at night. It seems in the Surprise area it's hard to find a variety of places open past 8-9pm. I also like that they aren't located on the Bell Rd cluster of businesses, which makes them more convenient to get to.

Overall I enjoy this place and will go back unless I find a cheaper spot."}
{"text":"OK, but the spicy pho that I ordered wasn't that tasty. I've been on better pho places than this one."}
{"text":"First time last night and I must say the phõ was very tasty! I am vietnamese and I know what a good homemade beef broth is. But PT Noodles proved me wrong last night. It was delicious and beat my expectations.  My boyfriend and I got the Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua. (Add for larger bowl)  and 2 orders of the  goi cuon. It's a little pricey for average Pho restraunts but for the area and customers it's a reasonable price. A must try in Suprise!"}
{"text":"Globs of tasteless vegetables piled on soggy noodles. Servers who did not know gluten free from gluten items on the menu. No substitution allowed. 

It's a small place to have so many wrong things. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is always our go too. It is a little pricey but it's good food and the staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"I had the curry shrimp and my kids ate the stir fry egg noodles with vegetables. This restaurant was absolutely amazing! The food was beyond delicious and the staff was so friendly and attentive! It would be nice to have a few more drink options outside of canned soda. Other than that this place was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Wow what a wonderful place to get good fresh food love this place will be back , my husband beef salad was to die for my shrimp fried was perfect , will eat here again"}
{"text":"PT Noodles! I could eat PHO everyday, so yummy! The staff is great and very friendly:) The restaurant is clean and welcoming. I usually get the PHO GA but I tried the Rice Vermicelli- Bun and it was DELISH! My girls had the Orange Chicken. They said is it is the BEST Orange Chicken they have ever had!!!! Thank you PT Noodles see you next time."}
{"text":"Finally a decent Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise that doesn't overprice their Pho! Walked and they greeted us and sat us right away. They have a large menu and they even serve Banh Xeo and Goi! Very impressed with their large menu. We had two servers who took care of us and they were both pleasant. Although I wish they were more attentive but they were very nice. My friend order their Pho and to be honest, it's not the best Pho but it decent since that area doesn't have any good Pho. I ordered Com Dac Biet (Combination Broken Rice w/ slice grilled pork instead of pork chop) and its very good! I will definitely be back to try their other dishes and see how everything taste."}
{"text":"Myself and a friend  just ate for the first time at PT NOODLES not expecting to have the service we encounter!  ( pulling up  and thinking this will just be another Panda Express).  I can just what And IDIOT I was to assume.  The staff were active and ready to help us with decision and options  from the menu. My glass although I just had water never went empty. The meal I chose was AMAZING ( to say the least) . 

As we were leaving, I had a brief moment to speak with the owner.   GREAT STAFF, MEAL and service  I will be returning soon

Thank you"}
{"text":"Excellent. Immaculate space. Great customer service, always making sure you're still good. Food is terrific. Best one in AZ I've found. Must try!"}
{"text":"Best Asian food in the valley. I asked for chicken noodle soup and chicken with noodles to go and what a surprise the food was absolutely delicious and the attention to detail was wonderful. There was plenty of food for My wife and I and we had leftovers the next day which even tasted better. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"FINALLY!! A place in Surprise that has excellent Vietnamese food... We've pretty much tried everything on the menu since they opened and it's never failed, always excellent taste and large portions. We go back about once a week and never get tired of it. The service is excellent and the restaurant is always spotless."}
{"text":"The good was amazing and the restaurant is well decorated. Friendly service and great food. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Had the Rice Vermicelli-Bun with BBQ Pork with Egg Roll and it was super flavorful. I'm not sure what the little Bowl of sauce is they give you but I could drink it with a straw, it is so good. Everything just goes so good together. The egg roll was spot on and crunchy. 

I really have nothing to complain about other than the service. Took forever to take my order and another forever to get the check. But it was worth it as the Bowl of Bun was one of the best I've had. 

Highly recommend them. Decor is nice and simple with a tv to watch. Clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new today so reading YELP reviews for this area decided to try Vietnamese food, which I have never had! So tried the rice noodles with chicken, beef and shrimp and vegetables and soup! No clue why they call it soup, it's a broth with green onions and cilantro!  The dish was a bit sweet but then came a bit of spice! Not knowing what to expect, I thought it was pretty good! Had the ice tea, with LIME, but did not taste too much like ice tea I know! We left full and may come back and try something else new! Food came quickly, nice and hot and everyone was very friendly! The place was clean, no wait, and friendly, always makes me happy!!!! Not a bad price for amount of food you are given!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried PT Noodles a few weeks and were hooked.  We eat a vegetarian and mostly vegan diet, so having a variety of yummy tasty options for a good price = winning.  Staff if very friendly.  Tonight they offered us drinks while we waited for our to go order.  They were willing to make an orange chicken with tofu instead, which my vegetarian teen appreciates.  Overall, great service, food, and affordable.  Will be coming back often!!!"}
{"text":"We got a few different bowls of pho to go, and each of them were delicious! We will definitely be coming back here to try other menu items soon."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice before my last experience. I enjoyed the food and service the first two times. I was there on Sunday eating dinner. The food was not up to the standards they had set previously, and the prices for one thai iced tea? $5.25! The service was also sloppy, each attendant that came to our table, didn't have any prior knowledge of what the last server had done, so we had to explain to them what was needed done each time a waiter came to our table. This place might be missing communication within staff. This was not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Still love this place and now they're getting the business they deserve. I am going to miss the days where we open this place, and it was just me and my Munchkin, at our table--yes we have a table--enjoying the peace and quiet and serenity of bowls of steaming noodles, assortment spicy and vinegar based condiments that I would slather myself in of my wife could take the heat.  

But I am happy for them. Great work guys.

{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Unlike many Asian restaurants the meats they use including the seafood are top-quality and they make their own noodles in house. The dishes are beautifully arranged in the interior is always clean. It's much healthier than the fried / sauce soaked Americanized food is served by many competing restaurants. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice Asian , Cambodian dishes. Clean and good service. Pricy for little whole in the wall with small portions."}
{"text":"amazing and im a very picky eater ..i dont like any thing im very amazed that i even like this kinda of food because im so picky with my food but im in  love with it and the employees (Steven is a rare gem he is amazing) are amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. It all kinda tased the same unless you add chili hot sauce. Don't think I would recommend or ever go here again. Food took some time to get & I have some type of noodle soup which I'm sure was already to go but still took longer then expected."}
{"text":"We love PT noodle and ate here all the time when we were at Goodyear. Was really excited when this location open but it was pretty sad lols it was Too sweet for my taste! Imo the other location is better."}
{"text":"I had the Pho with chicken and shrimp and it was good.  The service was friendly, the restaurant was clean and in walking distance to my hotel."}
{"text":"This is our go-to-spot for the Pho,the service is always welcoming and even when we came with a rowdy crowd they handle it very well and even tilt around with us. Their greentea/lemonaid is so refreshing on a warm/hot day. They get you in n out on take-outs so quickly,very good spot."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh and flavorful! The soft noodles with seafood was amazing. Fast and friendly service. Did I mention the servings were generous? Plenty to take home for another meal. I highly recommend this hidden gem in Surprise."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Food was very delicious.  Our server was so attentive and pleasant! During dinner,  they checked on us periodically to make sure we were happy and taken care of. Good price for the quality of food!  I love Pho and this place gives you plenty of meat, noodles, and broth. The rare steak comes out  \"pink\" and it cooks in the hot broth. That's how Pho needs to be served unlike other establishments, the meat is precooked and the broth is almost cold. This is a true \"Vietnamese dining\" experience.  I invited friends to try Pho and spring rolls and they loved.  Great seasonings, just right.  Not salty!! Thanks PT noodles."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. What a fantastic find!!! 
Everyone we encountered during our visit was pleasant and professional! 
The dining room was clean. 
I ordered chicken pho which was absolutely divine- my favorite yet! The broth was savory with just a hint of sweetness. The basil brought to accompany the soup was just about the freshest I've ever seen. I wonder if they grow it onsite? 
Huge chunks of white meat chicken were accompanied by a generous portion of thin rice noodles. 
We also ordered Vietnamese coffee! DIVINE! Hot and sweet with the right balance of acidity and creaminess. 
I can't imagine I'll go to another Vietnamese food establishment any time soon. Surprise is VERY lucky to have our very own PT Noodles."}
{"text":"Trendy ,great service ,clean ,super food.I will admit it I don't even know what I ate but is was really good ,fresh ,healthy ,kinda like a steak fajita.The server navigated my wife &I through our meal ,soup ,spring rolls.We will come back very reasonably priced!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Pho in Surprise. Every time I go here, it's like my taste buds are taking a magical journey to flavor town. Although the Pho is the mayor of flavor town, the Vietnamese curry, banh mi, and broken rice dishes aren't just lowly citizens. If Pho is the mayor of flavor town, the rest definitely are city councilmen. 

Look, you might be wondering why a kid who grew up in San Jose's Little Saigon would be yelping about this place. It's cause I grew up with this food. I know how it should taste. PT Noodles does it right."}
{"text":"We decided to try this out after seeing the reviews. Very clean restaurant, good, healthy and quality food. My husband loved it. The only drawback was one of the wait staff asked if we wanted water and we said yes and they never brought it. Then the same waiter came over and asked if we wanted more ice tea which we were drinking, we said yes and didn't bring the drink again. The other wait staff was great. Friendly and helpful. We would come back though."}
{"text":"PT Noodles was a pretty legit spot in my opinion. I got the pan fried egg noodle combo which had beef, chicken and shrimp. Some of the meat (beef) did not taste super fresh but it wasn't too bad. The flavor and texture of the noodles were fantastic. 

Shortly after eating my food I did feel a bit sick to my stomach. I'm not sure if it was the food or if it was because I had not eaten meat in quite some time. (I've had meat about 3 times the last 3 months).

I tried the avocado boba and thought it was good but could use a tad bit more sugar or agave to sweeten it up. The boba was cooked perfectly and fresh unlike a lot of boba places where they're over-cooked or under-cooked and too hard.

My girlfriend got the veggie and tofu pho which was delicious. I love how they deep fry the tofu into a crisp unlike a lot of veggie pho soups I've tried at various establishments. If I'm back on the west side I would come back."}
{"text":"Been going here for about 3 weeks now, and I've had the same plate about 3 times it was so good until today.  I ordered the same plate and it was terrible, bland no taste and absolutely nothing like the other times I've had it.  To top it off it's there most expensive plate on the menu.  I only ate half of it because it was terrible, when I told the waitress about my order and how awful it was she of course apologized and informed me that the cook that night wasn't the usual cook, plus she said he was in training, wow, I told the waitress people want consistency when they go to a restaurant and this wasn't cutting it.  We politely paid our bill and left.  The best they could do was to give us a measly 10 percent off woopie.  There you are, go at your own risk, maybe you won't be experimented on who knows."}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful experience!! The FOOD Delicious! The Service! EVEN BETTER! Very impressed with the Phó!!! I'm from Southern California and have had my fair share of Phó, this place really presented it amazing! The broth was delicious! My husband really enjoyed his Entrée which was the Combination Broken Rice. As Guest we never felt forgotten or our cups were never empty, the whole staff was friendly and very accommodating. Management WELL DONE! We will surely be back to explore more of the menu! Thank you for a wonderful dinner experience PT NOODLES in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Okay so I've already been to the other location. However I really like this location. It's bigger and has more room and is a lot nicer on the inside. I definitely recommend going to this location. Their pho is definitely on point here. They always give plenty of noodles and has lots of greens. And the flavor is phenomenal. The people there are really nice too. They always pay attention to when you need something. I was so stoked that a location opened up like 5 minutes from my house! Now I can go whenever I want. I only had 1 place near my house that is like 5 minutes away too. Everywhere else for pho is about 30 minutes or farther from me. Definitely go check this place out. It's in my top 3 favorites. I'm still trying to figure out what my absolute favorite is."}
{"text":"PT noodles will forever be my favorite Vietnamese restaurant hands down in Arizona! I have ate at PT Noodles for two years so far and I just love everything about it, the location, the food, and the service. I take my friends from college here, my boyfriend, and my family whenever I can. They even opened a second location in Surprise and it's better than ever! 5 stars off the bat, and I highly recommend this place. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"My favorite pho place in town!! It's ALWAYS consistent - absolutely delicious. The broth is very flavorful and the portions are great. The service is top notch as well. You really are treated as you should be. Everyone is so helpful!! I get takeaway orders often, and they help carry it to my car. Oh, and this place is immaculate. I don't know who created their cleaning regiment, but they are on it! 

Point is, try them out - I promise you will NOT be disappointed with the food or the service!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Went to the Goodyear location first and noticed they had one in surprise. So far, this is my 3rd visit and it's always photastic!!! 

On my 5th visit and just wanted to say the staff is awesome! Very friendly and knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"Just delish! Second time here for me (Phyl stops in more often) Cant wait to try their pork sandwich!"}
{"text":"I went to the new location in Surprise, wasn't sure what to expect.  My first time having Vietnamese food & it was absolutely delicious!  I had soft egg noodles w/ chicken, steak & mixed veggies.  It was fresh, flavorful & so so good!!  I'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"For starters the service was not great... we were told to sit anywhere and when we did it took the waitress 15 minutes to take our drink order (there were 2 small families already there and were eating) which didn't make sense why she took so long to come to our table. When we finally placed our food order it came out fast; the food was terrible. I ordered a hot & spicy soup and my husband ordered chicken, beef, and shrimp pho.. there was  barely  any meat, the broths were bland and consisted of mostly noodles. I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean. The staff was nice and attentive. We were seated and they gave us a minute and then took our drink order. Soon after they brought us out drinks we were given a small cup of soup. The broth was amazing! I had the pork banh mi sandwich. The roll was crispy and delicious, the veggies were fresh my only concern was how much like fish the pork tasted. My boyfriend had the chicken banh mi and is was very good. We also had some fresh spring rolls, egg rolls and the kids had teriyaki chicken. Next time I am absolutely going to try the pho. That soup at the beginning of the meal was so good!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant of all in the west valley. I go very often about at least 3-4 times a month or more, the food is exquisite and flavorful. The service is always on point especially a server named Steven he is awesome very attentive and always tries to give me new ideas to try new dishes (although I'm stuck on 17H BBQ Ribeye ) I do try new dishes but when I love a plate I try not to change because I love the flavoring. The entire staff is amazing very friendly and attentive as well. I cannot wait until the other side of the restaurant opens I am dying to try the new plates . Thank you PTNOODLES keep up the great work."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great. Decor beautiful food fabulous and the service was outstanding. I had the BBQ beef vermicelli my husband had the Vietnamese Pho both were delicious"}
{"text":"I have been wishing for a long time that they would open up a GOOD vietnamese restaurant in Surprise, but all we had was Saigon Kitchen which is a huge disappointment. So I was very excited when I saw PT Noodles in Surprise. I immediately checked the place out and it was a huge upgrade to their Goodyear location. Beautiful setup, bigger space and delicious food. Definitely a great decision PT Noodles."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The food was very good and came out quick. I cant wait to go back and try other dishes. It would be more helpful, though, if our server knew the difference between egg and rice noodles."}
{"text":"A very beautifully designed restaurant w excellent Vietnamese dishes to back it up.  Definitely, A satisfied customer n will be coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new fav place for pho. If we were in San Gabriel valley, .CA. I'd have a hard time choosing but here there's not many choices. I liked their spicy pho the most because it was  flavorful and for a nice comforting broth kind their reg pho was delicious with the tendon, I requested the yellow noodles and for me that made it better."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!!!!!! Big variety in the menu. They even have lobster. Probably the best Vietnamese Pho and surprise"}
{"text":"What a great addition to our Surprise neighborhood!! My husband and I had a lunch date here and sampled the Vietnamese sandwich appetizer which came out in record time. We shared the Pho with rare steak and were delighted in the flavor. My favorite was the stir fry noodles with the combination of shrimp, chicken and beef with the rice noodles..... SO FLAVORFUL! We will definitely be back! Yummy! Not to mention ALL of the staff were incredibly friendly!"}
{"text":"How is the food here actually getting worse? The prices have sky rocketed and the servings are enormous but the quality has decreased. Just because you give us more crappy food doesn't make us any happier. Seriously the food is so bland and overcooked. The pho just tastes like vegetable broth. The sauces things are cooked in are flavorless. I'm mad because I love Vietnamese food and this place is across the street but I refuse to go here anymore"}
{"text":"Pho and Crispy Noodles ..... authentic and delicious!  Also the Thai tea is sweet and tasty :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hangover cure, hop on over to PT noodles. Second time I've eaten here, and boy do they NOT disappoint. Always busy, but the service is fast. Hot kitchen style, once it's hot and ready to be served; IT WILL BE SERVED. I want my food hot, and that is exactly what I get. 
Always get the pho with rare steak and meatballs. I get a healthy serving of fresh veggies for my pho too. LOVE IT. 
Shared crunchy egg rolls and shrimp/pork spring rolls with my buddy. The peanut sauce was delicious. The perfect balance of sweet and savory. WITH PEANUTS. Yum. But the other sauce, the chili dipping sauce for the egg rolls was meh. It didn't taste like much to me so I swirled some sriracha in there. 
Nevertheless, happy and definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I was satisfied with what I ordered but they just didn't have the roasted Cornish hen or grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Love the Goodyear location so we gave this one a shot. Food is amazing as usual. Lost a star bc service isn't great."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for Pho soup. I ordered the combo, which is everything,  and was able to enjoy a good meal.  Now that it's said, a few things...  the broth was the only thing not quite authentic.  It was more of a vegetable broth with chinese 5 spice.. not authentic pho broth. 
Advise: if you add sriracha and hoisin... go easier on the sauces (especially the hoisin) as the broth is already pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese food.  Been three times and always good.  Solid 4 stars.  Service always good like the service buttons."}
{"text":"Highly recommended, Pho is great, ingredients and soup r just perfect. Clean is place n Customer service is friendly."}
{"text":"This is a cool place on a weekend afternoon if you looking for something different... tasty.. nice theme.. Good lord they serve kinda slow but nice peeps. Give it a try at least once.. you won't hate it"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and combination PHO!! They even have us a free sweet dessert drink at the end. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese pho soup in surprise! Watch out Saigon kitchen! I know for sure Saigon kitchen will be dropping their expensive food"}
{"text":"Wonderfully done! Pho was amazing, Service was great. The only reason why I did not give the 5th star was because our tea was not hot and the fact that there is no kids menu ended up paying $11.50 for a teriyaki plate for my 9 yr old. The place was very clean, The food is amazing. Most of the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Pho was fresh and delicious. My friend had the BBQ Bahn Mi and it was also very good. The bread is awesome. The staff was friendly and funny. The music was not our style but made for fun conversation. The crispy egg rolls had a lot of flavor and had more filling than most others I have had. I can't wait to try other menu items. 
I will say of the Pho that I like the noodles better elsewhere. But by a small margin so I'm not going to knock them much for that. Maybe 1/2 a star? 
Over all a great new place in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It is nice and clean relaxing and quiet. The food is great! We have never been disappointed. The Pho is wonderful. The people who work here are very helpful and pleasant. This is our go to restaurant since we moved here"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are here every week so I figured it would make sense that I leave a review. I love love love their pho. We get the steak and brisket but I've also had their chicken pho. Their broth is amazing and full of flavor. They definitely do NOT skimp out on the meat and all the fixings. 

My boyfriend also gets their spring rolls with their peanut sauce as an appetizer. We get shrimp and pork. Just as great!! I've tried their bbq pork bahn mi. I love it!! However I do add shriacha and extra fresh jalapeños for that extra kick. So hard to not order both sandwich and soup. 

We have not tried a lot more that's on their menu just because we love their pho so much. Anytime it's cold we use it as an excuse to have pho LOL I 1000000000000 recommend this place over any Vietnamese restaurant we've had in the area (for Pho). We moved here from Goodyear so were regulars at their Goodyear location. Thankful they opened a location in Surprise when we moved here."}
{"text":"I Went here for lunch for the first time. The inside is decorated nice with a clean modern ,casual setting. I enjoyed my meal, I ordered the noodles with tofu & vegetables . It was very good!  I will definitely be going back , I liked the menu."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing. Attentive, nice, and the service was super fast. Food was really good! The atmosphere is awesome too. Highly recommend this place! Fun place to go and they make sure you leave satisfied. My first time here and won't be my last. Check it out! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I did takeout. First time customer. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with a feeling of Vietnam. Shrimp fresh spring rolls were very good. The peanut sauce was okay. Lemongrass chicken stir fry was fresh and tasty. I will return."}
{"text":"Overall the food was great.   The Pho was excellent and the Vietnamese coffee was good too.  My only complaint was that the restaurant had an acrid smell when we walked in that almost made us leave before trying the food."}
{"text":"Had a craving for pho and decided to try this place before our movie as it's in the same parking lot as the AMC. Cute little hole in the wall, strip mall shop. Very clean with a pleasant decor. We were warmly greater by the hostess who opened the door for us. We got to choose between a booth, table, or high top. Everyone who worked there was very friendly and helpful. Anytime one of the employees passed by they asked if everything was alright or if we needed anything, whether they were our server or not. When we left, someone again got the door for us. Very hospitable. 
I got the pho with steak. It was a huge bowl and I ended up taking half home for lunch the next day. Hands down the best pho I've ever had. The broth was aromatic, delicate and rich at the same time, with a depth of flavor that showed true artistry. My husband got the BBQ ribeye with broken rice. It was crazy good. He let me try a bite of the crackling beef fat. I was hesitant at first, but he pushed me to try it. I do not regret that decision. It was crispy and flavorful on the outside, but on the inside it melted like beefy flavored butter! I wanted another bite, he said I'd have to order my own next time. Stingy! They also have a very limited wine and beer selection that I think is new because it's not on their website or menu. I got a nice glass of riesling for $6 with the added bonus of being carded for the first time in fifteen years! Total bill with a generous tip was $40 which I don't think is bad considering the quality. The meal took about an hour, which was fine, but plan accordingly if you're going to the movies after. I could have paid less and gotten it quicker at one of the Asian chains around, but would not gotten the level of service or anything close to the quality as we got there. I want to say I'll try the bahn mi next time ($5) but I'm going to have a hard enough time choosing between the pho and the BBQ beef."}
{"text":"We just moved out here from Louisiana and wanted some good food. We decided to stop by here. Going inside the restaurant was clean and we didn't have to wait for a table. The food was so delicious!! The whole family enjoyed it! And our server was great! We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"By far the best Pho in Surprise. I used to have to drive to mesa for pho, but luckily I found this place and it's only minutes away from home. Great prices and service. I come here every other week with my family. We love it! They're boba is also delicious!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants around the Surprise area. A very clean establishment paired with great customer service and excellent food is a match made in heaven. 

With the extensive menu of a variety of Pho, vermicelli, sandwiches, steaks and lobster it might take you a bit to choose. we ordered egg rolls for appetizers a BBQ beef vermicelli bowl, 2 hot and spicy noodle soups and a chicken bahn mi sandwich. Each item that we ordered was delicious, and I as I continue to come here I hope everything on their revamped menu is just as good! Off to a great start so far, thanks PT!"}
{"text":"Pho in Surprise!? It's a wonderful thing. Unfortunately, I'm a bit disappointed that they are way overpriced than any other pho place I've been to. 
It might be because it's in Surprise, and anything opening in Surprise is just a wonderful addition and a great way to not have to travel out of the city for pho, but makes them also be able to have pricey pho. 
Second, maybe it's a more upscale pho restaurant? It's definitely clean, and they seem to have a slightly larger staff than other pho places. 
Anyways, pho was good, nothing I have to go back for though.  I'm normally stuffed after a bowl of pho, but not from here. But it is in Surprise, so if I'm craving pho while I'm working in Surprise, I will still go for that $10 bowl of pho. (tax included and rounded up, but not including tip)"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho I have ever had in Arizona. Especially the surprise area where not much has been developing until recently. The rare steak is amazing and the shrimp egg roll appetizer was killer. If you haven't given this place a try it is worth the stop by."}
{"text":"I've been to the other PT Noodles down in Goodyear many times, and that restaurant is delicious.  Now they opened up another one in Surprise!  And this PT Noodles is as delicious as the old PT Noodles!  The restaurant is more spacious, better seating, better decor, and although the price of the noodles is a bit more expensive compared to the Goodyear location, the extra $1 dollar is worth it for a better atmosphere.  With 3 different Vietnamese restaurants are now competing, the future of this city is looking really bright."}
{"text":"What a lovely dinner spot under such lovely ownership!! Will definitely go back to get some boba!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pho!!! Quinn was our server, and she was seriously the best! I recommend 100%, and will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"The broth in the pho is so good and find myself craving it quite often.  I am only speaking of the Surprise location. Tried the one in Avondale/Litchfield Park area and that one wasn't as nice and the food wasn't as good as the Surprise location."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since they expanded. New cook, Pho has improved, much more flavorful. Spring rolls still not great. Garlic butter wings were good but too salty for me. Decor is nice, lots of bamboo. 2 TV's showing Vietnamese programs with English subtitles.
Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Go there and try the Pho! I was always going to Saigon for Pho until I discovered this place! I was missing out the whole time. The broth is flavorful and tastes authentic and fresh! Chicken or beef--both taste delicious. They have a drink menu with a range of selections. I am obsessed with their fresh squeezed  OJ!"}
{"text":"First time in last night and I will be a regular when I go to the movies.  Had the bbq pork, with egg roll vermicelli.  Delicious combination.  I met the owner and general manager and they were extremely nice and friendly.  I love Vietnamese food.  Throw a dart at the menu and you will get something great.  Very good prices too.  My dinner with a Chinese beer was $14.50 plus 20% tip.  Good service needs to be rewarded.  I know people that would never set foot in a Vietnamese restaurant until I bring them there and it always becomes their favorite.  Try the sandwiches too.  I am sure they are great.  ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Greeted with a smile. Fast service. Place is clean and food is amazing. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Pho! Very nice atmosphere, great service, good prices. I will be going back on a regular basis. Very excited that this place is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Never been so happy about food! I was driving to get water rice when I drove past this food gem! I said to myself that I would come back and get something to eat! I called in to order stir fry rice noodles with shrimp chicken & beef and fried rice with chicken and beef. I was pleasantly surprised that everything tasted so good! The food was savory and flavorful with the right amounts of veggies and meats. We devoured the food within minutes!!! I'm bummed I live on the east side of town but I'll definitely be back! Can we get an east side location?"}
{"text":"Super amazing pho! Great prices and big portions ! Owner is very nice and attentive speaks to customers"}
{"text":"Probably the best Pho in Surprise we've found. Great service and huge portions. We've been to a few other Vietnamese restaurants around the valley and while the portions are good size when you order things like shrimp Pho there's only 2-3 shrimp in the entire bowl, but here my sons portion came with around 10. He was very happy. I had the chicken, beef, shrimp Pho and it was amazing. Just added some jalapeño and it was even better. My younger son had chicken fried rice and couldn't finish it, but was very happy with it as well. We will definitely be back quite often."}
{"text":"Nice to see they opened a location here in Surprise and it's larger than their Goodyear Location. The service is good and the place is very clean. Food is very good. We go here regularly and also get take-out."}
{"text":"I'll be back again.  I loved all the veggies in their soup and noodles.  Even my baby loved their food.  There is an option to upsize for a couple more dollars and it was so worth it.  I split a plate and bowl of soup between 2 adults and a baby and we still had leftovers.  I'm looking forward to trying their more exotic menu items.  They are on the menu!  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I got the beef pho (with just the steak). Nice big bowl of pho with a small tree of basil. Service was really fast and pleasant. They have a button on the wall to alert the staff if you need to, but they checked on me so I never had to use it. The broth is more on the fatty and sweet side and they give you a nice amount of beef. About $10.17 after taxes (tip not included). Happy hour starts at 1:30 according to the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection, nice ambiance, good service. I highly recommend the PHO and lemongrass chicken."}
{"text":"This was our first vist to Pt Noodles and the food was to die for i  got the 16E (Fried Rice with Crispy Chicken) my wife got the 14 (Hot and Spicy soup) our server was amazing so polite and understanding of the menu. the place was clean and very beautiful! cant wait to bring the whole family next time"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to the opening of PT Noodles in Surprise for weeks.  PT Noodles does not disappoint!!

The food was delicious! Big bold tastes!  We had pho with beef and tendons, chicken fried rice, and crispy egg noodles with beef, chicken, shrimp, and veggies. Loved it all! My daughter couldn't get enough of the crispy noodles. 

Staff was attentive and friendly. They even have a call button on the table for service. 

On top of all that, we got 10% off of our check! 

Since I live across the street, I will be a regular customer!!"}
{"text":"Very excited to finally have another option for a vietnamese restaurant close by. I was just a bit disappointed with the food. We ordered pho and some other dishes and they were on the salty side. Service was great as it wasn't too busy the time we went in. I'm hopeful their dishes will be better as they get feedback and get more established from their grand opening. Will definitely be going back for more pho and boba."}
{"text":"Best pho place I have ever been! The curry chicken is awesome as well! Will be coming back all the time! The manager Steven is so nice he makes you feel so welcomed! All the waitresses are so attentive and never make you feel like you're a burden. This place is awesome the taro boba is to die for! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in surprise. Great food, with quick and friendly service. As well as fantastic prices and portions. This place is new, but is a must try in surprise!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Surprise! It's my go-to place when I want to grab dinner with friends. The staff here is always friendly, the portions are huge, and the restaurant is bright and clean. Most importantly, the food is delicious! The pho is the best I've ever had and the fried rice is excellent as well. They also have great coffees and teas, and the deserts are great, especially the ice cream."}
{"text":"We used to really like PT Noodles but that was some time ago. This is positiively the last time we patronize that establishment. My husband wanted the beef lovers salad so he stopped by and picked up two orders. OMG, The salad itself was huge pieces of lettuce, tomatoes, etc. and that was soooo annoying. The worst of it was that the \"beef\" could NOT BE CUT WITH A STEAK KNIFE. What a waste of food and money. We're out."}
{"text":"Love the food and smoothies. A fancy place to eat that's easy on the wallet. They have both dishes that are authentic and those that appeal to Westerners palette."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Goodyear location, but when work moved me to Surprise, I was happy that there was a PT noodles here as well!  First of all, the food is delicious! The pho really hits the spot and I really enjoy the salads as well. I always get the chicken pho and the papaya salad. But what really compelled me to write this review is the service! As I was driving home with my pick up order, I totally spilled all of my pho broth! But when I came back, they happily gave me another portion. I'm so grateful! Definitely a great place for a Vietnamese food fix."}
{"text":"This place has good pho! And good egg rolls. I've also tried the rib eye steak plate with and egg. Excellent! The only complaint is the service. Everyone that works there comes up to you and you're not assigned a waiter or waitress."}
{"text":"As a Vietnamese self-proclaimed food critic, I can proudly say that PT Noodles' pho is LEGIT. The broth is pure medicine. You can smell and taste proof that they didn't cut any corners when boiling the beef bones and getting the spices just right. It's ALL YOU NEED when you're feeling down, or sick, or just hungry. The cure-all.

Noodles are always cooked to perfection. Served with mint, bean sprout, onion, jalapeño, and lime. I always get my beef rare on the side (make sure you use lime for this), and it's always good quality you can trust. Never sketchy, never brown spots. 

The ice coffee is also great here (Vietnamese style uses sweetened condensed milk instead of cream/sugar)!

Waitstaff is always friendly and attentive. Fairly priced. Overall atmosphere is normal for a pho place. BUT why bother going in person when they offer FREE delivery! That's right. You heard it here first. @realwhitneylove B-)"}
{"text":"What an extremely pleasant experience. 
I've been to this location before as a dine-in customer. Great service, clean environment, and satisfying food. 

This was my first time ordering over the phone. It was 30 minutes to closing, and trust me. I work in the food industry, there's nothing \"fun\" about customers coming in - or ordering in a few minutes before closing. I had no other option. I wasn't ready to spend money elsewhere without prior experience, on the fly, of course. 

The waitress that took my order assured me that it would be no problem (even with my extreme order). She was cheerful, very charismatic, and genuinely happy to help. Mind you, it was 30 minutes till closing when I called. 

My order was to take 15-20 minutes. Exceptional! I went in right after my call to wait. I didn't want to come too late. A waitress offered me water and their waiting area was comfortable and very clean. 

I ordered two beef phos, pork bbq with an egg roll, two fresh spring rolls, and two Thai teas. They added a soup with my order, it was much appreciated. I was also given a 10% discount for being military! 

They held the door open for me and asked if I needed help to my car. All the waitresses said goodnight, too.  

Overall. Exceptional service. 

(The food is good. Very clean. I am Asian. I eat a lot of Asian food. If you're looking for a \"street\" type of flavor, this might not be for you. The service will have you back if you do decide to give it a go. THAT is how good their service is. I can not speak for other locations of PT Noodles, except for this one in Surprise.) 

Thank you for excellent customer service, even a few minutes from closing, you all did marvelous at giving me quality service. I WILL be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time for us, I feel bad that I just now have the time to write them a review. Or have I be? Can't remember, oh well the more the better right? Everything here from the location, to the food, to the way they decorated the place, to the servers. Everything is ON POINTTTTTTTT, my all time favorite is BUN BO HUE ( spicy beef noodle). Then there's the shaken beef with a side of egggggggg. Oh let's not forget the chicken and cabbage salad, it's a must have appetizer. They have a lobster tank here!!!! Did I mention that? Well now u know, fresh lobsters. The garlic noodles with lobster is a must try if ur a lobster's lover. Man idk what else to say, prices are reasonable, $35 lobster, I don't think that's a lot, right? Right, the portions are so big that the whole family can share. LOVE LOVE the place, if you love authentic Vietnamese food, please come to this place."}
{"text":"Much nicer than other Pho restaurants in the way of decor.  Fast, friendly service and GREAT pho broth. Didn't even need the extras to put in the soup. I recommend the chicken/shrimp/beef pho and the chicken beef stir fry-great flavor!"}
{"text":"This is a quality place. I'm a huge fan of Asian cuisine and spend lots of time in Asia, not to mention, my wife is Asian. Being the egg that I am (White on the outside and yellow on the inside) I'm extremely picky when it comes to Asian cuisine. Does this place have the best Pho I've ever had... umm heck no, but it's pretty darn good and for where it's located it's a welcome treat. I too agree with another review, the beef wasn't that fresh, but it was still decent.  The food is priced right and it's a welcome addition to the North West Valley."}
{"text":"We went yesterday to this place and we really love it the flavor, the environment, the services very nice"}
{"text":"The BEST Pho on the west side!! The broth is extremely flavorful, the portions are great! The restaurant is very clean, and well decorated. The employees are kind and personable! 

I would absolutely recommend everyone try the Pho here. 

I usually get Pho Tai."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Food is amazing and the service is awesome. This a must try for those that haven't had it!"}
{"text":"First time trying pho and it is delicious. Good food, great service and very clean restaurants."}
{"text":"First of, the Pho is easily one of the best I've had. Ultimately it comes down to the broth and it's really flavorful. If you can drink it just by itself, it's a good broth. Their spring rolls are excellent with an awesome peanut sauce that really makes the flavor pop. Banh Mi was very tasty with good bread and meat. The ribeye rice dish was amazing, it came on a skillet with a fried egg and the sauce was phenomenal. The Thai Iced Tea was nice and sweet and finally we had the mango and taro ice cream which had a wonderful presentation and was good. Highly recommended for vegetarians as well."}
{"text":"You really must try this place. The food is hot and fresh, the vegetables are always crisp, the noodles are nice and chewy (the good kind of chewy). Service is exceptional. We asked for Spring rolls without cilantro and it was no problem. Try the combination stir fried noodles, and the fried rice is so filled with shrimp, chicken and vegetables that i almost wanted more rice. If you are not familiar with Vietnamese food, this is the place to go, as they will walk you through any item. Try something you haven't tried before, like the Pineapple Tea."}
{"text":"We eat Vietnamese food multiple times per month. This was our first visit to PT Noodles and most likely our last. To start, the service was not good. We had to ask multiple times for our drinks, upon getting them they were never refilled.  My entrée come out 10-15 minutes ahead of my wives. The food had no taste and the brisket was tough in my Pho. My wife had the BBQ Beef - Bun Cha Gio Bo, and said it was not edible. We also ordered the spring rolls which were nothing special. The best way to put it, it tasted like fast food Vietnamese food if that type of restaurant were to exist. I really don't like leaving negative reviews because this is an opinion of my experience and possibly not yours. Plus I want local businesses to succeed, but our dining experience was to negative to ignore. If you are interested in the Vietnamese restaurants we frequent with positive experiences every time, try Saigon Kitchen in Surprise and Angelina's (our favorite) in Glendale."}
{"text":"Glad to see that there's now a PT Noodles in Surprise. 
Located in the same area as Papa John's pizza, and is actually a couple doors down from them.
Parking is shared with other businesses so you may have to drive around a bit (not a big deal or inconvenience) to find a spot. 
Interior décor is nice, the interior is clean and well lit with enough lighting.  Staff and service were top notch and very prompt to address any needs and serve you. 
Food was very well cooked and prepared hot, and seasoned well. 
There's lots of variety on the menu enough for me to return - guaranteed."}
{"text":"This location has a great seating area and beautiful fancy menus.

The star of the show though is the pho broth, there are times where I try it without adding anything and I get stuck in a dream like state just sipping away.

Back to reality! The pho size and price is fair, the spring rolls are tasty, the service is great.

veggies for the pho are always fresh and super crisp, I've been to this location a few times and don't plan on stopping anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get Pho! Environment is nice and clean. Staff is friendly and efficient. And the Pho is to die for! Also try their boba if you have any room left in your belly."}
{"text":"If there was an emoji to express my satisfaction with my recent visit, it would be the happy yellow guy with hearts for eyes.  Food was amazing.  I ordered the rice noodle bowl, my husband ordered the pho and my daughter, fried rice.  All of us, who usually share out food were protecting our orders like baby cubs.  

Very fresh ingredients, good environment and good music.  

The negatives were: the staff was less attentive than they should have been, food timing was off and music was too loud.   Easy fixes in my eyes."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food in Surprise. Had the combination Pho and the broth was amazing. Many choices on the menu, very clean and lots of food servers."}
{"text":"Stopped in their first week open.  Excellent food and service (we got take it).  Even got a discount that we did not expect.  Will definitely be back.  The Pho was delicious and took me two meals to finish it all."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and it's so good. The service is great and fast. Everyone is so friendly. I always get pho and this place didn't disappoint. It was so flavorful and I could even finish it, it was so large. My kids loved it and the bahn mi was the perfect size. I'm so glad to have a place like this in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Found my new favorite lunch place while working from home ! Wow didn't know this place was here. I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"When you have 2 kids, sickness spreads like wildfire!  My son has an ear infection and my daughter is running a little cold.  Know what that means?  Yep, they passed that shit on to me!  I was feeling a bit under the weather, and I decided that I needed something to clear out my sinuses and soothe my throat.  What better than a steaming hot bowl of pho with a ton of Sriracha sauce dumped in?  I made my way down here to get my soup! 

I walked in and was greeted by the friendly hostess.  I was asked if I wanted a booth or to sit at a high top table.  I chose the high top since I was by myself.  If I was with a group of people, the booths would be more comfortable.  The chairs on the high top booths were slip, sliding around on the tile floors.  I probably should have just opted to sit on the seating against the wall (booth type seats with backing, elevated).  Next time, I will.  Anyways.....I ordered a water and a bowl of pho with rare steak.  My waitress placed my plate of goodies in front of me (bean sprouts, jalapenos, mint, limes etc) and about 5 minutes later, my pho was ready.  Here is how it was............

Pho with rare steak (11c I think it was, on the menu)-  This bowl of pho looked awesome!  It had a ton of green onions, parsley and steak floating on top.  I usually get my pho with just plain noodles, but today I went with the steak.  Some pho places use some cheap cuts of meat, but I am glad to report that PT uses some mighty fine steak!  It had great texture and taste and no \"funky pieces\".  There was a ton of it, too!  The broth was nice and hot and there were plenty of noodles, too!  Great flavors all around!  I picked and plodded my way through my bowl (still don't properly know how to use chopsticks, but I did my best ;-) lol!).  I ate out all the solid parts, and then was left with a huge bowl of Sriracha soaked broth and green onions.  I spooned mouthful after mouthful of that great broth into my gut and loved every minute of it.  It definitely hit the spot and made my nose run, my brow sweat, and my sinuses clear up.  Exactly what I wanted it to do!  

Overall, I am happy to know that this place is here!  It's close to the house, reasonably priced ($8.50 a bowl), and very delicious.  Service was friendly and nice, and the place is brand new, clean and inviting!  I am glad to have this here in Surprise and I hope to be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Food is good only thing is their manger with the circle glasses sells like arm pits all the time so nasty when u wanna eat your food has has he heard of the shower or deorent....am sorry for who ever made him manger"}
{"text":"Love this place so much. The customer service is on point and more then that the food is amazing. Super amazing. I work in the same complex at the amazing Double Edge Salon and I cannot resist stopping her several times a week to eat. Better then the Vietnamese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quickly becoming my favorite.  My wife discovered it and I am finding the place a great place for lunch or dinner.  The only problem I have with the restaurant is that I must not take my concealed carry firearm with me when I go in.  the food is great and I have found the service is great.  I love that they have a button on every table that will summon your waiter.  

The Spring Rolls are great, I would like the thick peanut sauce but the use a fish sauce instead.  The PHO is great and with the addition  of a menu that has numerous other items including Vietnamese sandwiches which I have not had in 20 years it brought back memories.  The staff seems to be all Vietnamese and the decore is great."}
{"text":"Always awesome. Do yourself a favor and try it. The #11C is by far my favorite. Only gripe is that the soft drinks come in cans."}
{"text":"Their TV choice is NO GOOD
The same tv channel is on every time we eat there
Its always some guy in a king yellow costume who don't do nothing but play game w guest and eat food
Put something like shopping and travel channel
I'm already at the restaurant to eat- I don't need to see other food that look and possibly taste better than their food"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Had lunch there again today with three of my neighbors.  We all ordered very different items and we were all well pleased.   I have eaten at other Vietnamese restaurants and had convinced myself that I really didn't like the food.  Now I still don't know if it is authentic or not and to be honest I really don't care.  I have now found a place were I can get my noodle fix.   The egg rolls are really good and there are four in an order.  You will want to share these as the portions of the main dish are huge.  The stir fry tends to be a bit greasy but that isn't necessarily bad just be forewarned."}
{"text":"I am so happy that they are open at the surprise location because I live 2mins away from here. Tonight was the first night that we ate here and it was great. The pho is great and the place is very clean. I am so happy because every time I m in the mood for Asian food I have to eat Panda and now I can eat at PT noodles."}
{"text":"Visiting Surprise, Arizona on a business trip and decided to try PT Noodles because they have Bun Bo Hue or spicy beef noodle. Well, 4/5 for taste, 4/5 for the amount of meat but 3/5 for the amount of noodle. 3/5 for not having pork blood ..not authentic! :( 

3/5 for Bun Mei / bbq pork sandwich. 4/5 for the amount of meat but lacks the veggies that gives the sandwich it's taste. 

Overall it's a good Vietnamese restaurant. Just lack the authenticity of a good Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was great, the best takeout I've had in a while. I didn't really like any of the girls working tho... they didn't really acknowledge that I was there or make me feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Their pho is perfect.

Words. Words. Words. Yelp wants more words in order to accept this as a review."}
{"text":"Very good. Haven't really had pho before so I don't have much to compare it to but it was very good. The beef bone broth was very clear and clean tasting. The beef and brisket was very tasty. We went during happy hour it was a good deal to try items. We also had fried egg rolls and my BF had the mango tea which was pretty good. We will be back to try more items."}
{"text":"Nice quiet and clean restaurant serving real Vietnamese food. Great food at reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Very nice decor, friendly stuff and pretty good pho. I have had some hit and miss with service but every one can have a one off. I would take people there. I do think their passion fruit tea it's way over priced."}
