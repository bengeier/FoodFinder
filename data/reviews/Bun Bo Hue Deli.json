{"text":"I have been a patron here for the last 8 years.  Their Bun Bo Hue recipe is more or less consistent all the time. Over the years I have introduced family and friends to this family run business and many have made this location their Bun Bo Hue location of choice. In addition to their fantastic noodle dish, this deli has a satay recipe that is just stellar! My best friend makes me being several bottles to Vancouver for him when ever I visit.  I would strongly recommend anybody to try Bun Bo Hue Deli for themselves.    Oh, make sure you're not going out right after eating, the broth smell lingers pretty heavily on the breath and clothes."}
{"text":"Was told about this place by a Vietnamese friend whose mum recommended it to her - always a good start. I've never been to the store itself, but have had their bun bo hue that you can buy for takeout.  How it works is that you bring a stockpot to fill with soup and they will ask you how much you want. We got $30 worth which I think they tell you will feed 6 people, but it is a LOT of food; 3 of us ate maybe a quarter of the amount given. You walk away with everything you need for bun bo hue at home: broth, noodles, meat, garnishes, etc. The broth is delicious and is really the star of the soup. I don't claim to know what authentic bun bo hue tastes like, but this was very tasty and complex and not just spicy. I thought the broth was pale in comparison to version of this soup that I've tried before but don't let it fool you, the chili oil that you add in is very spicy and you don't need very much. The nice thing about their soup is that the spiciness is not just all heat, but a lot of flavour as well.   Definitely recommend as a great takeout option, especially if you have a large group! And it's nice that you don't need to call ahead, pots of soup are always available for takeout."}
{"text":"Bun Bo hue that tastes legitimately home made. What more can you ask for. Love this place. Their meat balls are so good wonder who their supplier is. The quality of beef isnt the greatest but at the price one can't complain at all. A big bowl costs like 8 bucks and change. I have done take out and it is such a good idea you bring a pot big enough ask for 30 dollars worth, you will be eating nothing but bun bo hue for 4 days - for me it was only for 2 people. He packs everything up for you like noodles herbs sprouts onions hot sauce you need nothing.  I rarely ever give a place 5 stars but this place is such a gem. Don't judge the place by the way it looks, the food is amazing. My only complaint is that they don't seem to sell the spring rolls anymore he is always out of them I always ask...... The spring rolls are so damn tasty here."}
{"text":"Although decent pho, seems the only venue that sells 'pho bun hoe' by name, yet not really outstanding. Very different from sate pho, it's flavours are not complex nor much layered at all, but quite passable.   Located in 'Little Vietnam' district in the south/north east of Calgary, it's slanted much more toward take-out in big bucket quantities, as it seems there's no waitress at their dining area across the hall. Most customers who arrived while I was observing and waiting walked away with big home containers filled with soup, as did I when the proprietor lent me a plastic bucket. For these reasons I'd stretch it to 3.25 stars overall.  But it's obvious he and his partner (wife?) are hugely committed to ensuring their take-out customers prepare the soup properly once home. He cautioned us on the sparing use of the two hot sauces, that proved itself so true when eaten. So cool.   The dish? The noodles are pre-cooked but cool upon take-out with the instructions to microwave them once home so that they aren't overcooked if put back into boiling water. Good quality that nicely add texture to the soup. It seems that the genuine Vietnamese flat noodles may not be easily available in Canada.  When the broth is re-heated for eating, it's transformed into a good base for the rest. The sauce flavour of course was not as rich as the street food in Asia, but, aside from Watercress on 17th SW and Pure Viet on 8th Avenue downtown, better than most experienced in Calgary (even with an insistent request for rich flavours). The pork balls and beef pieces both sliced and rough were tender, but a departure from the marinated beef slices in Asia. As well, the pork foot was so tough that what meat was on it wasn't chewable. Consequently, I think that this is low-end Vietnamese village fare.   The condiments that accompanied the soup taken home were fresh and plentiful: sliced limes, chopped green and shredded white onions, super fresh basil leaves, and two hot 'sauces.'  The proprietor charged me $20 for 6-7 large bowls of soup: at that price, so worth it!  All in all, even though somewhat inconvenient if one doesn't live in the Forest Lawn area, I recommend it."}
{"text":"What a surprise! My usual satay/BBH spot was closed today but a friend recommended this place.  Tucked away in a weird strip mall, with counter service only and ample separate seating.   Ordered the medium #2 BBH with Viet coffee.  Very delicious and simple bowl of BBH. Ample selection of meat (meatballs, Viet sausage, pork knuckle and braised beef), perfect noodle to meat ratio with the usual bbh feeeexins and savoury simple broth.   Will definitely be coming back for round 2."}
{"text":"Delicious soup at cheap price. My family usually buy $20 of bun bo hue some weekend when we don't want to cook. And the portion that they give is huge. $20 and 4 of us are full"}
{"text":"Solid bun bo hue spot. It is cash only. This is a no fuss type of establishment (you go here strictly for the food not the service which is why they can keep food prices low). You have to go over the deli counter to put in your order and then go back to the other side to grab a table.  They also do take out but the minimum order is $20 which comes with the noodles, herbs, fixings and the broth (it's better if you bring your own pot). I find that the $20 pot usually serves four decent bowls of bun bo hue.   You can order takeout in denominations of $10 with a minimum amount of $20. When I have 10 people over for dinner; I usually grab a $50 pot and we always have some leftovers."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Can't beat this place.  Next time, I'm bringing a pot."}
