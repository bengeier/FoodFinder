{"text":"This an intimate theater and there's not a bad seat in the house. There's no fancy, Las Vegas thrills, but for a comedy show, it was a great venue. There's a cute cocktail lounge in the front of the show room where you can sit and have a few drinks before and after the show."}
{"text":"This steak house is inside of silver seven hotel casino. Smallest steak house I have ever been to. I think they only got 10 tables. Staffs are very nice. Not much ambiance.  Free bread was good.  I ordered salmon dinner plate. Salmon had no flavor it was OK i tuink it need little salt but very fresh. . The asparagus was very good. Cooked perfect.  Overall foods were very fresh and very hot.  Meaning my server didn't messed around.  She brought it right off the grill. Well I had good dinner at reasonable price and good service. I am a happy customer"}
{"text":"This restaurant was SO wonderful! I had the rack of lamb, medium rare, and it was outstanding! Cooked perfectly, and extra mint jelly on the side. My husband and I split the asparagus side...again, cooked perfectly. He enjoyed the rib-eye....grilled med rare and so juicy & flavorful. Our crew was Cheryl, Remy and Jerry....we were so blessed! They truly made it a memorable meal. My husband enjoyed the Ribeye...cooked to med rare perfection! Sipped the Zin Your Face...highly recommended!!  There are so MANY places in Vegas to get a decent meal for a really reasonable price, but this place is one of the hidden best. And if you stay a night in the hotel, the tropical pool area takes you to a whole other place, far away from the buzz of the strip. What a wonderful getaway.... will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to a number of shows in the backroom. It's laid out very nice. ALL seats are GOOD seats. They have a waiting area that consists of a bar area, DJ, sofas/seats, and board games. Drinks are very reasonably priced.  Once inside there is a second bar. I would say the show seats around 80 people. Booths in back. Seats surround the stage. The seats (folding chairs) are not comfortable. The seats are the only thing I don't like about the experience.  I would recommend this showroom. I will be back!"}
