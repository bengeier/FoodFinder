{"text":"Great food and good customer service. If you want some real Dominican food then you should go here. Also, the Morir Soñando juice is to die for! We love love love that juice!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! I drive from an hour away just for the mangu! Super friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"I'm an East Sider and we have NO Dominican restaurants by me so when my buddy from the West recommended Quisqueya, I was all about it. After verbally butchering my order of \"chuletas con mofongo\" the waitress playfully corrected me and made sure I knew what i was getting myself into and promptly went to the kitchen to have the chef start me and my buddies' orders. The ambiance is something to be desired with nothing but Telemundo playing as you wait for the plate but the food makes up for it! The pork chop was tender with a delicious crisp to it and the mofongo was a great compliment. The only downside of my meal was that i was tricked by my friends into drinking a Malta Goya which might be Spanish for \"Monkey Sack Sweat\" because it was THEE worse thing I've ever drank under false pretenses. Altogether, any time im on that side of town I'll be giving Quisqueya La Bella another butt in the seats"}
{"text":"On a road trip and found this place right off the highway. I had mofongo con chuletas and a papaya shake. Excellente"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Dominican food . I recommend the 3 golpes - Mangu , huevos, salami and best fried Spanish cheese ever !!! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I ordered their talipia which was out of this world. I am Puerto Rican so I know what good PR/DR food is! Service was lovely, local, made from scratch food!! Hands down would visit again next time I'm in Cleveland. This place does PR food right!!! About 12 dollars a plate but with the amount of food they give you, its worth it."}
{"text":"Very sweet people! The food was great! We had arroz con gandules, plátanos, mofongo con shrimp, y Dominican fried chicken. It was so good and flavorful."}
{"text":"The stewed chicken was a hearty flavorful meal served with beans & rice. Find and aromatic memories of this dish. Yes,  I would order it again though it was a bit more ($12) than I normally pay for lunch. That said, the food here is excellent and the portions are large so come to eat a lot or come prepared to share it or take some home. The selection of tropical drinks is also good. 
All in all, a bit like a quick vacation to the tropics, right here in the CLE!!"}
{"text":"Considering the general lack of Caribbean restaurants in greater Cleveland, this place is as good as it gets! I mean, where else can you get Mangu around here?  The food options are tremendous and the service is great and attentive.  If I can't go to Sousa every month, at least I can come here and reflect on the things that make DR so great!!"}
{"text":"If I could pick anything less than one star I would. My husband and I had a craving for traditional food while at the same while supporting our Latino community, so we decided to go here. And we regretted it. We were served pork that was at least a day old and the owner made it seem as if he did us the favor telling my husband he was served a larger portion of usual....really? Cause I think that was their way of getting rid of the pork. Then my husband was given beans with his side only to have it snatched away by the owner saying \"Eso no es tuyo\" (that's not yours) ten minutes later to be given to the table behind us. I was beyond myself at this point...come on man...my husband had been breathing over his food and you going to give that to someone else??? The owner had the nerve to ask if everything was even though he could clearly see we didn't touch the meat at all. I had too much to say and I'm a professional do I decided best not to tell him what I thought at that instance."}
{"text":"A low-key store front belies the hearty, savory food emerging from the kitchen in this Dominican staple! 

A friend and I parked along the curb out front for our first time here, not being quite sure whether there were better/legal parking options elsewhere. It was a little past normal lunch hour, so business was slow but we seemed to be the only non-regulars. Most people called in their order, hung around to chat a bit in Spanish when picking up their order, then went on with their life. We dined in at one of the booths along the wall, the other wall being occupied by a vacant bar. The hostess was welcoming but pretty hands-off and tolerated our butchering of the names of the Dominican dishes and provided us a pitcher of ice water and two glasses. You can request a few lime slices with yours if that's your thing. 

Both my order of Stewed Chicken w/ Beans and Rice (Habichuela y Arroz con Pollo Guisado) and my friend's Shrimp Mofongo (Mofongo con Camarones) came with a simple salad. I wanted to try the Stewed Beef instead, but it wasn't available. The shrimp in her dish were little flavor-bombs, each and every one. My chicken was just on the upper side of average, but the stew itself made for an oily, yummy mess when drizzled over my rice. The beans for my dish came in a separate soup cup to be mixed in as I pleased. Both dishes were pretty filling - a siesta will definitely be in order if eating here for lunch!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and good food--we got to try both the mangú and mofongo. I ordered the egg/cheese/salami with mangú. The mangu was flavorful but a little too salty for me, especially given the salt in the cheese, but I loved the perfectly cooked fried eggs with a runny yolk--that definitely can make or break a dish. The shrimp I tried from the shrimp and mofongo were tender and well-seasoned!"}
{"text":"It's a small r3staurant that is not visually anything special. The food how ever is perfect. I'm not Hispanic so I can't speak to how authentic the food is, but we were the only non Hispanics in the place. I loved every bite of my food and the passion fruit smoothie. The serve was very nice and answers all are questions."}
{"text":"I had the goat, beans and rice. It was amazing and the wait was short. We received excellent customer service as well! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We came to Cleveland from PA for the Holiday weekend and decided to try this place because the food looked good and authentic. The food is very good but the reason why I have to give this place 3 stars is because of the poor service. They seemed to be short staff so it took a very long time for the server to take our order. We ordered empanadas that never came and one of us wanted the fish and the server said the kitchen wasn't going to make it because they were busy. Right after, we ordered drinks that came after the food came and after we asked for them again. Yet again, we had to ask for an extra juice that they forgot which all were overly sweet by the way.  After we ate, the server brought the check and said - did you guys get everything ? It seemed like she already knew we were going to miss stuff. We told her we never got the empanadas and didn't even receive an apology, or offer to come back. I also thought the sides were expensive ($7.00). I think this place has potentials if they focus more on customer service."}
{"text":"I'm so very happy that I've found this place.  It was quick, fresh and delicious! I got take out and it hit the spot and had just the right amount of rice for the Dominican in me (a lot).  I will be going back and bringing friends to try it out during lunch."}
{"text":"Well being from the DR myself and knowing a few things or two about my country cuisine I can tell you this is it when it come to flavor and savor excellent food good authentic caribe taste those looking for a good food I recommended. 

Not a fancy place but full of flavor and the staff is superb. . .

Thank s guys good job."}
{"text":"My buddy and I took a couple of Dominican chicks to the shooting range the other week. I felt glad to empower the girl. She never held or shot a gun before. Like Nas said on \"I Gave You Power\", well, I gave her that power. I stood behind her and showed her proper form / stance. Yeah, it may have been a creep move to stand directly behind a girl while she shot a gun, but damned if she didn't like it! Hanging out with these Dominican chicks had me wondering what Dominican food tastes like. So I looked this place up. 

A few months ago something happened in my mind and body that turned me off from eating meat. I have been trying to eat a very \"clean\" diet. I have also been like the first NWA album after Cube left: 100 Miles and Runnin'. Fitness is feeling great. What does not feel great is when my buddy is now getting stronger than me. I have noticeably lost strength because of this combination of cardio and lack of protein. I guess these stupid Greek yogurts have not been cutting it. After he showed me up again lifting weights in his basement today, I was pissed. I was driven by this primal aggression and anger to eat meat! Like all you other hateful and mean carnivores! So I drove up to Quisqueya La Bella so I can regain my strength that I have been missing. 

I had the beef stew with beans and rice. They ran out of yellow rice which bummed me out. Once I got the food home, I realized that it didn't matter once all of the meat juices and beans were mixed in. I also added chicken for $4. They carry a bunch of other Latin American food items. Most of which I don't know what they are. Which is my favorite part of discovering new ethnic foods. I highly recommend coming here. If you like Rincon Criollo and Puerto Rican food, you will like this. They have a lot of dishes with plantains. The atmosphere is cool. There is a tropical beach painted on the wall. They play baseball games on TV. The service is friendly and accommodating to even lame gringos like myself."}
{"text":"Best Dominican in town, hands down. I love the Dominican culture and people, their food is some of the best. I like this place because my Father knows the owners, the Spanish community is a close knit one in Cleveland. Everyone knows everyone around here.  I can get a meal on consignment if needed. That helps in a pinch. 

The beef stew is better than Rincon Criollo, which is saying a lot, because their beef stew is good and they give you a lot. You get so much rice and a lot of meat too, they're no slouches, lets just say that. They feed you the way they like to eat. 
All of the owners/workers are regulars at San Lorenzo Night Club. Who by the way also has pretty good eats on Friday and Saturday nights. Sundays also, select hours. 

Having the \"Spanish Connection\", so to speak, around Cleveland is a good thing if you take a liking to the cuisine. I grew up on it and like it more and more as the years pass..."}
{"text":"This is a no-frills restaurant that serves really good food at a reasonable price. I usually order the grilled chicken with rice and beans. They serve you a huge plate with the chicken leg and thigh resting on top of a bed of perfectly cooked rice. The beans, in a delicious sauce, are served on the side. I usually end up pouring them on top of the rice to soak up every ounce of the juice. 

On a recent visit, one of my dining companions ordered the shrimp mofongo. I've never had mofongo before so I was excited to try it for the first time. Wow, is it good! It might be my new \"go to\" at lunch."}
