{"text":"For $3 (kids meal) you can't go wrong, this meal includes rice+coleslaw and chicken. You can have a choice of BBQ, jerk or fried. They have their special 'red sauce' and beef gravy, which are pretty bomb. I would definitely recommend this place to people who want cheap and good filling Jamaican food."}
{"text":"Place recommended by a cousin of mine .. came when they were closing and found out most of the items were sold out before they closing . So we order what they had .... my usual go to carraibean food is ox tail and roti .   Ox tail stew did not live up to the taste ... for me was dry and bland ... I have been having Mona from Sheppard and they are awesome .   Chicken  roti and chicken curry was good  . The rice Bean was OK .   Food quantity has different size from small ,medium to large ... so it cater to everyone ...   I would come back for the roti and chicken curry ...  Ox tail I prefer heading back to my fav Mona ."}
{"text":"Great value for money when you get the toony Tuesday deal.  I don't know if I would have it any other day."}
{"text":"Things to know about Mainsha before going  1. They only take cash and only small bills  2. They may only have one type of chicken at any given time and their not going to make a specific kind just for you  3. It's not a nice looking place (from the inside or the outside)  4. There is only two seats if you want to try to dine in and there are usually taken up by friends of the staff hanging out  5. There must be something wrong with the ventilation; on cold days the steam from the kitchen can fill the whole place including the takeout counter so much you can barely see   With all of these things considered I say...  Get over it and go to Mainsha!  It's tasty Caribbean jerk at a price that doesn't make sense. I won't bother telling you the menu items as I have tried it all. Just go with an open mind and an empty stomach and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The rice is always dry i don't know why, I like  the mainsha at keele and Rogers way better !"}
{"text":"If its Tuesday, and you're on Eglinton West... YOU MUST DROP IN! Mainsha has a local reputation for one of the best \"toonie Tuesday\" specials in the City!   Come with patience as the place is usually packed, and the service can sometimes be slow - but leave with a few orders... One is never enough for me!  $2.50 gets you a nice big piece of chicken, rice and peas and a small side of coleslaw. I also suggest getting a fresh juice as well!  Bootlegged albums and movies can also be purchased from some creative street vendors outside lol"}
{"text":"Three stars for $3 chicken. $3 chicken is pretty much where it's at. Haven't ordered anything else really. I've tried fried, barbecue and jerk chicken. Comes with rice & peas, coleslaw and \"red sauce\" (sweet sauce) if you ask. I dare not look around the kitchen, how the food is handled, or the lack of decor. I just close my eyes after I make my order leave my $3 on the table and hold my hands out until they hand me my styrofoam container of suspiciously delicious chicken. Then I proceed to walk out the door without looking back."}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken with an extra piece of fried chicken with rice pees and slaw. A tad dry but clean and not to oily.  A good deal that hit the spot for $9 tax in with a coke."}
{"text":"The most ignorant people ever from all mainshas.  I waited politely in line for ten minutes while the cook and server were talking to the person ordering,having a convo about Jamaica. Then n after the wait. The cook asks the people behind me what they would like to eat instead of asking me S I was there before the others. Still I waited then again the cook asked another man who walked in what he would like and that's when o said you people are either racist to white people or are just simply ignorant. I will never go yo their location again . aside from. This incident they don t serve children's meals only 5 dollar meals which they don't fill. Very disappointing as this was the place I ways went to when my mom was a live."}
{"text":"Even though this place looks so run down, I love their cheap jerk chicken kids meal. My Buddy and I love to get two of these meals just only 6$ better than the 5$ medium meal where you get the same amount of chicken as the kids meal. SO WORTH IT. If youre on a budget really cheap and satisfying lunch!! Love the Keele location more though not a big fan of the Jane and Finch location where they switched names."}
{"text":"There is no spot for the location at Lawrence Square so here goes.  ONE STAR.  Pitiful, ordered chicken roti, they actually had rotis to make it this time, and coleslaw.  No slaw, what a big surprise NOT.  This location is horrid.  The staff don't give a ____.  Anyway got to table with roti and found it so full of bones it was a torture to eat.  it was 1/4 bone fragments.  Sorry but everyone else in town can manage a boneless roti, some with slaw, for the same price and give a smile.  Sorry but if all Mainshe's are like this WALK AWAY QUICKLY VERY QUICKLY."}
{"text":"I use to really enjoy eating at this place.... But me a friend have both wondered if they might refry the left over chicken from the previous day.  Damn is it greasy... Maybe I will stop getting the fried and try the BBQ or Jerk..."}
{"text":"Very good bang for your buck!  They have pretty good fried chicken.  Lay that on some rice and peas with plenty of oxtail gravy with some steam veg for only $5.  Can't go wrong.  Their jerk chicken was just okay.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great value for the servings.  Toonie Tuesday is awesome.  I keep telling Coco (the owner) that he has to bottle and sell the red sauce.  My favourite is stew chicken.  On Tuesdays - I get BBQ or fried chicken.  Lines are long and slow - but to me - well worth the wait.  I just wish there was one near my new place of employment."}
{"text":"Went in to Mainsha today for takeout. I ordered a large jerk chicken dinner and was blown away! They make one of the best jerk chicken in Toronto. The portion to price ratio here is great. They fill up the takeout containers to the max. The older ladies that work here are just fantastic. Their Super nice and you can tell they take pride and passion into cooking your food."}
{"text":"There's not a lot you can do with 2.50 cents in Toronto. However on a Tuesday, you have the choice of getting either Jerk, Chicken or BBQ chicken with rice and peas/ or white rice . They have distinct gravy's with you choice red sauce, oxtail or stew . You have a choice of coleslaw and veg. One of the best deals you can get in Toronto hands- down."}
{"text":"$2 for chicken, rice and peas and coleslaw? How can you possibly go wrong? I would have given it 5 stars because the food quality and portions are amazing (inspite of the price, which is a bonus), if only there were more places to sit and eat while it's still warm."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for years, and part of me wishes I kept driving past.... The upkeep is horrible, they might not have chicken, coleslaw, or any other damn thing you might find at a West Indian restaurant, but when they do, boy but when they do is it every delicious. OK let me explain... nowhere in the city are you going to get a meal for $3.00, but here you can... the issues are they often do not have food. I have gone six times in the past three weeks and it has been hit or miss. They offer BBQ, Jerk, and Fried Chicken meals however only ONCE have they had any chicken besides fried. OK OK OK, you're thinking it's so good they are sold out, NOPE... not the case as I have went in when they first open to be told they don't have food. How the hell do you own a West Indian restaurant and you not have rice and peas... no joke. I keep going because when I can get the full combo (chicken, coleslaw, and rice & peas) it is delicious with some \"red sauce\" applied... I just never know when I am gonna be able to get the full combo...."}
{"text":"Spent $10 on stew chicken and ox tail. Pretty much just got bone, no Meat.  Ended up just eating rice and peas with gravy. (Not the best thing to eat.) they don't take debit or credit. So had a 20 on me. Refused to take it even though my bill was $10. Forced me to use their atm machine inside which charged me $2 for a transaction. They did not have any napkins. At the end of it, was still hungry. Going to mc Donald's for a quick snack now. Really disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming. The first time, I wanted their curry goat roti ($8.00). They were out of curry goat. I left. This time, I tried again for the curry goat roti, and they were also out of curry goat (sad face). I surrendered and got the curry chicken roti ($6.00).   It comes boneless (I watched them de-bone curry chicken pieces so that they could make my roti). I believe the roti came in regular roti or chickpea. I opted for chickpea. Chickpea roti is like two thin layers of roti with a layer of crushed chickpea in-between. It's an interesting texture that isn't for everyone. I happen to enjoy it. Anyways, between the de-boned chicken and the curried potatoes (in fairly large chunks for the most part), there really wasn't much sauce in the roti. The chicken was tender (although a lot of it was in very thin strips) and so were the potatoes, but the potatoes could have been in smaller pieces and they could have been slightly less salty. They weren't super salty, but if I don't desperately need the extra sodium, I'd rather not have it. Having the whole thing together in one bite (chicken, potato, roti), it was just about right. Good flavor. Very filling.  The entire thing was wrapped up and placed into a small takeout box. It may not have been a large box, but it felt like I was holding a brick. That thing is no joke. I'm not a small eater. I had between a third and a half of my roti before giving up. Part way through, I looked at my roti a couple times and wondered why there was still so much left. I wish there had been more curry sauce so it wouldn't be as dry, but all in all, a really good, really filling cheap eat.  Cash or debit, although tonight, they had their debit machine turned off by about 9pm."}
{"text":"I had better jerk chickens before but I just love the toony Tuesday deal where you get a nice meal for $2.5 There is some line up and about 20 minutes wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant growing up. When seeing there was a location near yorkdale mall, I naturally walked in expecting my usual $5 box of fried chicken.   I was told that fried chicken would take 20 minutes AND there was only white rice. Since it was freezing out and I was really craving the food, I waited.  While waiting on the chairs in there, I and saw a cockroach crawling on the wall. I didnt know what to do, or if I shouldve said something.. But it really made me think of how clean the place is and if my food was clean..   Overall, food was okay.. Not worth the wait. And I didnt get sick. So thats also a plus."}
{"text":"I usually come here for their Toonie Tuesday Special, which is $2 and some change for either a small BBQ chicken OR fried chicken with rice & peas, and veggies (or coleslaw).  I come here for lunch sometimes during work because it's convenient and the closest thing around that's decent.  It's a small restaurant that is primarily for takeout. It has a few bar stools by the window but only enough for about 4-5 people. You place your order at the cash and then bring your receipt to the side of the restaurant where they prepare it in a container for you, kind of like cafeteria-style. I've had their jerk chicken as well and it can be quite spicy! Sometimes they sell festivals (fried dough balls) too but not all the time. They have oxtail, curry chicken roti, and other dishes.  It's a decent place for lunch during work, so if you're in the area and you're craving something savoury and spicy, try Mainsha!"}
{"text":"I would have written a zero star review if I have that option. This place is a joke. When I read in another review that they make you purchase fried chicken that person is not joking. I've been to many Mainsha locations and I've never heard of such ridiculous rules.   I wanted 2 Tuesday special of bbq chicken, i was told I had to get one bbq and one fried chicken. When I told the lady I don't eat fried chicken she tries to convince me to pay more for the kid's meal which she explains is the same size. I was not allowed to just purchase one bbq. I was too annoyed so I drove slightly south to another amazing Caribbean restaurant (Chris Jerk).   I'm not willing to follow their stupid rules. It's not the money but the principle. Will never be going back ever."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Toonie Tuesdays and had best chicken ever for $2.50 tax incl! Great food and crazy good prices!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fry chicken on the Eglington West chicken-strip. The rice and peas isn't going to blow you away, and I like their slaw because it's not too creamy. The star of the show is the fried chicken. Make sure you pop in for a toonie box on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Not sure why Yelpers have reported this location closed because I passed by last week. Not the greatest jerk or fried chicken I've ever had, everything was a little mediocre. The chicken was dry, the rice wasn't flavourful, the gravy was oily. Not worth coming back."}
{"text":"Other reviews have pretty much covered the reason this place gives Tuesday a whole new meaning. Chicken and rice for when you're famished for a quick grub but do get 2 orders(if you're really hungry) because they tend to go easy on their rice servings every Toonie day.  I suggest getting the BBQ version, (same price $2.50) as it has has a spicy and tangy sauce. Long lines and mixed crowds of locals and neighboring workers during lunch.  Recently though,  I felt quite the attack of cold sweats, migraine and thirst afterwards which had me thinking they may have brined their chicken/sauce mixed with MSG for the extra flavor so stick to H20 when grabbing a meal here.  Chicken was also not fresh and obviously cooked the night before and preheated for a speedy Hello Toonie goodbye quality."}
{"text":"Definitely the better location. Located near Yorkdale Mall in a run down plaza, parking is minimal and lunch time is a nightmare with traffic.   Today was and still is Toonie Special, every week and it's our go-to place if we wanna feed the army who enjoy a properly and deliciously prepared chicken meal.  Ended up with 10 containers of their toonie special mixed of jerk, fried and bbq flavored.  Jerk : Seasoned with their jerk spices (dry rub).  Fried chicken: Perfectly coated with the right amount of batter and moist, tender meat. Bbq: fried chicken coated with their tangy, sweet and a tad spicy bbq sauce. Finger lick in' good!! My favorite for sure.  Their coleslaw is fresh and compliments the sticky rice the chicken comes served on. For $2.50 you can never go wrong but feel appreciative of the few comforts in life that come dirt cheap and Mainsha, you made our food run easy and a hit among the girl's soccer team."}
{"text":"For the love of Mainsha's other locations that offer good chicken meals and great deals, 5 star treatment is not what's expected but the family run vibe keeps me at arm's length to BBQ chicken on a Tuesday. So when you do get a smile to go with your fast food styrofoamed smelling glorious, it provides a gateway to becoming a 'regular'.  In this case, sadly not.   Quite surprisingly, the odd treatment we received came from the owner himself, who shared no remorse to our confused reactions to his ridiculous house rules as he barked to his staff to ignore our requests.  An order 'request' granted a go signal at all the other Mainshas we've been to. Why not here? Read on.  The order we placed : 8 BBQ chicken meal  OWNER's response (as he instructs his staff): \"No! Only give them 4 BBQ and the other 4 fried chicken meal\"  We then requested to just go with the 4 BBQ meals instead as the fried chicken wasn't our purpose of even being there. I wanted 8 of the BBQ MEALS as the chicken is sauced up just right, whereas the fried chicken meal tend to be dry with limited seasonings that are too bland for my current liking.  THE KICKER! OWNER's response: \"They cannot have 4 bbq, give them 2 BBQ AND 2 FRIED chicken meals!\"  I wanted to chew metal at this point! So again, I guess it's his house, HIS RULES! He seemed a like a big baby in diapers as he stood behind the counter while he prepped the FIRKIN BBQ CHICKEN, pouring sauce on about a 100 of them. So no shortage problems there, just a short circuit in the brain.  We weren't in the mood to argue with a man who seems hung up on his strange mathematical view on marketing his menu choices and mistaking customers for JACKARSES, so seeing that he loved his BBQ CHICKEN so much, when you head to this particular location, expect half and half from how you get your feathered fried friend to service and to abide by a rule I find TABOO!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places for Jerk Chicken. It's close to my house so, it's super convenient for me.   Their sauce is delicious, the rice and peas are perfectly cooked and the chicken just falls off the bone.   Not to mention the super cute staff!"}
{"text":"It's toonie Tuesday and I didn't want kfc so I came here not my first time I've been coming to this exact location for years love the warm greeting you get as you walk in the foods always the same when you come here great that is hands down I love this place"}
{"text":"I'm very glad I found this place.   Walked in here off the street on a whim and ordered the jerk chicken dinner ($5) which is   A. *~*Delicious*~*  B. Really comforting  C. Tastes (and feels afterwards) like someone who knows how to cook did it the right way.   I'm pretty sensitive to salt but the seasoning was spot on, and it was enough food to feel very full and have some left over.  I got it with the greens (collards I think) which are really delicious and actually make it a very balanced meal. [Hi Mum]  It's not really a sit down place unless you're just grabbing a bite, but for take out, especially to feed a group, it is the best around.  Conclusion: 2 Become 1."}
