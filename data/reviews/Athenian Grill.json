{"text":"Wow!
Just moved here from Los Angeles, this place could put a lot places out of business!! Food looks and taste amazing, you can taste the effort and love they put into their amazing food. The quality of food here OMG!! It is GREAT!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  I got a late to-go order.  I had the lamb burger with a side salad that was off the charts. My husband had the gyro and fries and very much enjoyed it.  The staff was super friendly and the cook (maybe the owner?) thanked me for coming in as I was leaving.   Very affordable prices.  We will definitely be eating here many times in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here after soccer away game because the yelp reviews were good. The decor is neither inviting nor horrid. The prices are very fair. The gyro pita was quite good, very good gyro burger, too. The French fries are limp and without flavor. The side Greek salad was decent and sprinkled with kalamata olives. We would come back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and staff with friendly attitude. Amazing fresh food and people that really care about their small business. If you're in the Indian Trail area visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow! Absolutely amazing! I'm from NY and haven't been able to find real Greek food in Indian Trail. I had the Greek salad with chicken and it was fantastic. Big portions and reasonable prices. I definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and wanted a good gyro. What I found here was the best gyro I've ever had. The pita was perfect, from temperature to texture to size. The lamb was as flavorful as it was plentiful. Topped with just the right portions of tomatoes, onions and tzatziki, these gyros are unforgettable. Then add the authentic, homemade Greek dressing and there you have a complete, unparalleled sandwich. All three of my visits also included substantial portions of Greek french fries and a Greek side salad which concluded delicious, filling meals at a more than affordable price. The food was always backed by service that kept all facets of my visits at 5 stars. Unfortunately I live a couple hours away, but that won't keep me from coming back, nor should it keep you."}
{"text":"Our waitress recommended the Pasticho.  It was outstanding.  Hummus was fantastic.  Very friendly staff,  even though our kids were horrible.  They went out of the way to make us feel welcome."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the ruff. Fresh food, great service and  we really really really enjoyed it a lot.  Thank you for the great food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and you get a lot for what you pay! I have enjoy some pitas, souvlaki and the bigboy burger, all were fantastic also the greek fries and salad are good. Good for a lunch outing, cheap compared to other local greek places."}
{"text":"Just went to this place for the first time and loved it :) we went when they were almost closing and wanted to just get food to go. While we waited on our order, the waitress got us waters and was very thoughtful! I thought this was very unique. She didn't have to do that,  but she wanted us to feel comfortable while we waited :) 

The food itself was awesome! I got the shrimp pita and was very pleased...will definitely be revisiting this one!"}
{"text":"Great food for a good price! I also liked the portion sizes - not a heaping platter of food but we definitely weren't hungry after. The kids' meal came with plenty of food and a good size drink. My only complaint is that their kid's gyro doesn't come with tzatziki sauce, so it was just meat on pita. Next time we'll get a side of the sauce."}
{"text":"This place was really good if you looking for a quick bite without the full on restaurant atmosphere this is it i ordered my food and got it hot to my table within minutes fresh!"}
{"text":"Wonderful waitress. Great food. Atmosphere was just meh. The owners were very grateful for your business and kind. It was just a little too sterile and generic for me. It's a good place for lunch, not necessarily dinner as there's no character to the place. And the falafel and fried cheesecake are excellent! Not to mention the hand cut fries, definitely get those!
I would likely return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Grabbed the lamb gyro platter with Greek fries and a Greek salad. A good amount of food for under 10$! The fries were delicious and cooked perfect. The gyro was good as well, but the sauce was what made it really good. Overall I'd say it's a pretty good place and I'm glad I stopped by on my break."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place, we got the party platter with hummus and tzatziki as we had the family coming in for Christmas and they loved it.  I always order the Gyros, they're great, and my wife and her mom who is 98 and lives with us love the Greek salad.  As to some of the earlier comments about the \"buzz,\" I have eaten all over the world as I travel extensively and although I would not rate this in the top 10 global restaurants where I have eaten I would say that this is still a neighborhood gem with good food and a really friendly, caring owner."}
{"text":"From the popcorn shrimp, to burgers, to chicken entrees this place was pretty amazing! Got to get the Greek fries too! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I opened a business in the same shopping center so I eat here often, too often!  But it's just so good, the staff is very pleasant and I can eat relatively healthy without breaking the bank!  I have recommended to many friends and family!  Great food, good service and excellent prices."}
{"text":"Long wait time for food, no one else in the place.  Mediocre food but prices are reasonable.  Would rather go to the Steak and Hoagie Shop near CPCC for good Greek food, much faster service as well."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this!  We love, love, love this restaurant!  A welcomed addition to Indian Trail.  This location has been many restaurant with none of them lasting long at all.  I truly hope Athenian Grill does because it is one of our favorites!  We tried it when it first opened and have been back numerous times.  Our favorites are the chicken soulevaki, greek salad and the feta burger.  The Tazeki sauce is to die for!  All homemade and the portions are good and the prices reasonable.  Service is great and the owner is very nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent Greek cuisine. Moved here from NY - grew up next to Astoria the Greek capital of NYC - this place makes me feel like I am back in NY. Great food at affordable prices. Very tasty. Kids love it too. Waitress' are personable and attentive.
Only 1 critique - tables are a bit sticky and could use a good wipe down. I wipe it down myself - nothing too bad and it is not going to stop me from eating here weekly.
 Opa!!"}
{"text":"Drove from VA for a day trip and stopped by to grab a bite after reading reviews on yelp. We weren't disappointed. Good, fresh food for a low price. Good sized portions. Ordered three entrees, a beer, two sweet teas and baklava for dessert, total came to approx $35."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot in town. Quick service , good food. Happy to give them a thumbs up"}
{"text":"Fantastic traditional gyro pita sandwich. Moist, flavorful meat and perfect Tzatki(so?!!) sauce! Also, the French fries were fresh cut, hot and delicious. The Greek seasoning was not bad, it just didn't add much flavor. Really, a minor complaint. Wanted it to be special like the rest of the meal!

Waitress was friendly and didn't make any mistakes. Prices were very affordable. 

The baklava wasn't one of my favorites (it's my second favorite dessert overall so I'm picky) as it was slightly dry and not as nutty or flavorful as others I've had. It was the largest piece I've ever seen but it was also expensive for the size ($3+). 

I'm new to the area so this was my first try to find a non-chain restaurant for a fast casual style meal. But, with those minor issues aside, it still earns top marks and will be my go-to gyro place from here out."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Outstanding food.  Tzatsiki amazing, gyro great, salad fresh.  Will be back next time in the area."}
{"text":"Best Greek and chicken salad I have ever had!!!  Our daughter (10 years old) loves their children's cheeseburger.  Great food and reasonably priced!  We go once a week!
We give it five stars (even though the app would't accept the five star we tried to give it)."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times, and it NEVER disappoints!  The staff is extremely attentive & friendly, and the service is very quick.  My Village Greek salad (that I chose to add chicken to) was so good!  Their homemade greek dressing is excellent, as is their Ttzatziki sauce.  The food is fresh, extremely tasty. and healthy - since it is Meditteranean - and you get a lot of it. You def. get a big bang for your buck at Athenian - it's a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean Food at a great price.  Will be back again and again.  Everything we tried was great and very large portions.    
We will definetly let others know to come and patron this place."}
{"text":"Good food and a large portion for the price. We always get the chicken souvlaki platter. Can't beat it for $8.00!"}
{"text":"Absolutely an awesome meal.  Fresh ingredients prepared by a real chef,  I have to agree with other reviewers, the tzatziki sauce was the best I have ever had.  The staff was very attentive, the service was reasonably fast and the prices were great.  I will highly recommend The Athenian Grill to my friends."}
{"text":"Best falafel...best gyro platter! Very generous portions, extremely fresh, best wait staff, great customer service. And we're from NYC!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!
The place was attractively decorated with wall murals, new booths, chairs and tables.
Service was prompt and courteous.
Grilled chicken pita sandwich with Greek fries great tasting and tons of chicken. Most places are skimpy!
Pork pita with fries was terrific and cooked well.
So full didn't get to try the baklava :(
Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had the Greek salad with grilled chicken  and homemade Greek salad dressing and tzatziki.  Salad was fresh and tzatziki was very good. Waitress was friendly and attentive lunch was cheap."}
{"text":"The prices here are cheap... And I mean extremely cheap! Our dinner was around $20 for two including tax and tip. The food itself was disappointing based on the reviews. The gyro meat seemed processed or lower quality but still pretty good. Just more state fair gyro than authentic gyro. The greek salad was decent quality. The fries were awesome! Overall extremely great value for the price and worth a stop for a cheap eat. Just don't expect the best most authentic greek you've ever had. Excellent attentive friendly service as well!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in the area.  The food is always very fresh and delicious.  The wait staff and owner are always super nice.  We eat here every week and are NEVER disappointed!"}
{"text":"1 star for the tzatziki, 0 for everything else. This place is lousy. To begin with the tables, booths, fake plants and sagging ceiling tiles are any combination of worn out, dirty or sticky. The service is abysmal, at one point I was literally mid-sentence telling the waiter something and she just walked off. 

The \"rotisserie\" lamb is actually browned in a pan, and it makes for some soggy meat. And careful for what you order, it's likely to be called a gyro and end up being meat in some store bought pitas with absolutely nothing else on it. 

The \"Greek\" fries had a few flakes of dried oregano on them and the salad was nothing special, especially the styrofoam tomatoes. 

And for some reason the sides are all American fare, fried okra, cole slaw...not sure why there isn't anything greek about it."}
{"text":"Great gyro. A lot of food for the price. Food seasoned good and didn't have to wait for anything"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem folks! Let me just say, if you enjoy authentic Greek cuisine, this is the place for you! The food is the star here and it is like going to Greece through the food. I grew up working at a Greek restaurant in my youth and I feel I know what good Greek food tastes like. I had the Greek Stuffed hamburger steak and it was so good. It is a huge piece of hamburger steak filled with onions, green peppers, and feta cheese. It melts on the fork! I got the Greek fries with it and they just were delicious. Am I gushing about the place, you bet I am! The friends I was with had the marinated beef tips ans souvalaki and they were blown away too! The portion sizes were huge and the prices very affordable! My Greek Stuffed hamburger steak was like 7.95. The waiter was very courteous and friendly. We drove like 20 miles from our house in Fort Mill, SC on a tip we got from a neighbor and it was worth every mile! I cannot wait to go back again and try something else, like the BAKLAVA! As Homer Simpson would say,\"Baklava.....YUMMMMMMMMMM!\"!"}
{"text":"First time in, clean, friendly, well staffed.  I had the stuffed steak.  It was very good, huge, fresh. Prices are excellent.  I will recommend and definitely return myself."}
{"text":"Good Greek restaurant that makes well-prepared dishes from its limited menu. Salads are fresh and generous and the lamb burger is unique. It would be great to see some kabobs like lamb and  beef on the menu as well as whole grilled fish."}
{"text":"Found this place through restaurant.com, great little place, delicious food and you get a ton of it for the money. Warm and attentive servers who are also very knowledgeable on the menu, will come back !"}
{"text":"I have been here with my fiance and family several times. The crew who work here are courteous, helpful, and attentive. The food is always piping hot and delicious. I usually get the pork chop pita with regular fries (mountain of fries with tender pork bits). The tzatziki sauce is awesome! Even their lemonade is good. Ingredients are fresh, crisp, perfect."}
{"text":"I've never rated anything on Yelp before.  However, this place was so good that I just had to write a review.  The food is outstanding at a very reasonable price. I had a traditional gyro, and my wife had a chicken souvlaki platter. The ingredients were fresh and hot. The Greek fries were a special treat with various spices. Also, the service was very good. We are definitely going back to the Athenian Grill."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing! 

I travel frequently and I love trying non-chain restaurants. I looked up a few and decided to give this place a try. My experience was so great the first day that I decided to go twice in my trip. Not only is the food great but the staff is very attentive and patient!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting much, but the food was delicious. My favorite things were the Greek salad with gyro, Greek fries and the tzatziki. We ordered the spanakopita app but it a little boring. I ordered the greek entree salad with gyro meat and I am SO glad I did! I ate the salad with the Tzatziki sauce instead of the Greek dressing. I tasted the the greek dressing and it was ok, but the Tzatziki was so good it did not matter! Beware, the olives tasted awful - even my husband who likes olives couldn't eat them. He ordered the gyro with greek fries and salad and he loved his food also! I am sick of leaving all these new chain restaurants hungry, so I really appreciated the portion sizes here. It was actually enough to fill us up but so good we ate every bite! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Typical Greek restaurant, which is a good thing because when it comes to Greek joints, \"typical\" means lotsa good food for the money,  friendly, attentive service and pride of ownership. It  doesn't have the most exciting atmosphere (also typical) or located in the most appealing area (a storefront) but let's face it, who really cares? Not the faithful regulars that love this place. 

The menu includes the usual array of gyros, souvlaki, burgers, salads and desserts. I went with the Chicken Gyro with hand-cut Greek fries. The pita bread was perfectly browned and loaded with an ample supply of tender chicken, tomatoes and Tsuziki sauce. The Greek fries were a little too soggy for me, while the normal fries were quite good.
 
My wife tried the Chicken Souvlaki platter. It came loaded with the same delicious tender chicken, Greek salad and a mountain of fried okra, all of which was pretty good.

Everything else was okay too, especially their sanitation grade of 100! Definitely worth a try but just short of  Gotta Try. Personally though, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great affordable meal and it was extremely tasty as well! We got a chicken pita, falafel pita, and a souvlaki platter, and we devoured the entire thing. The waitresses were very attentive and sweet, making our experience even better! The only complaint was that the seats on the booth weren't very comfortable; the springs were all out of place!"}
{"text":"I have to give Mr Quinn a 5 star rating as our server, very attentive and consistent.  The food was reliable and though I wish I saw more lemon in the food. We love a home cooked meal for sure and this was it. However I'd focus more on freshness, lemon, less oil because these folks have a good thing going for them. Love the Tzaiaki sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has really really good french fries fresh with oregano on the top. I love the chicken gyro platter. It was huge with a Greek salad and rice. All the waitresses were very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. It was not crowded at around 1 o'clock lunch time. Just enough people so you could be comfortable and talk. A major Plus is that they are showing the soccer games from the European championship."}
{"text":"The food is excellent as well as the prices. The staff is mostly awesome. I've only had one waitress that was lazy and took her time taking my preset and never came to refill my drink. Luckily another lady working stepped in when she saw my empty cup and gave much better service."}
{"text":"The hostess/ cashier was awesome, extremely friendly however it just so happened that this was my first time there with my boyfriend. I was looking forward to my grilled chicken salad and after chit chatting & paying for our food I came home to a pathetic salad with no lettuce, plenty of tomatoes & grape leaves. I am livid & now going to bed hungry! My boyfriend ordered the pork loin platter & seemed to enjoy himself however he realized it was chicken over rice instead. Customer service was great however how are you dead on Monday & still manage to get our orders so incorrect. To sum it up after that experience I will not come back!"}
{"text":"First time customer - food was great. Lady that helped me was very nice and had good suggestions."}
{"text":"As a first-time visitor, I thought the Athenian was a wonderful, unexpected find, especially among the modestly-priced class.  I quite enjoyed the falafel pita, while my wife equally enjoyed a chicken platter, both graced with the restaurant's spin on Greek fries.

Two other factors went into this very favorable experience: 1--the unobtrusive, pleasant back ground music, and 2--our waiter, Collin, who was attentive, accurate, and personable.  

We'll most assuredly return."}
{"text":"Food and service was really good. I had the chicken Philly and my partner had the pork tenderloin and they were both delicious. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! My family has eaten here several times. I'm a huge fan of spanakopita and it's wonderful here. I also had the special Pastitsio, which I wasn't familiar with, and enjoyed it. All of the Greek entrees are authentic and freshly made. There are also non-Greek entrees on the menu which makes my husband happy. Service is friendly and prices are quite reasonable. I plan to dine here often!"}
{"text":"I came to Athenian wanting Turkish coffee (or Greek, if you'd rather); instead, I left with my heart won over by Chicken Salad Pita and its lip-smacking, chunky self... not to mention Chef's Special Fried Cheesecake -- its delicate filo and sweet syrups still on my tongue. And though that coffee was a no-show (not sold here!), I heard I could dine with a wine or two next visit. I'll keep that in mind when I'm in the mood to undo some Grape Leaves or get nice and intimate with a Chicken Souvlaki Platter one evening.

I was serviced well here. Wave upon wave of full-bodied flavor. Moreover, the atmosphere was full of energy... patrons having at it here and there, everywhere... whether it be Horiatiki or Lamb Gyro or Baklava. All for relatively cheap.

Any innuendos aside, Indian Trail has a solid Greek eatery up its alley. Yet with an ever present crowd already in on the action, I doubt there are many who've yet to hear just how good Athenian is. I'm already dreaming about my next visit...

FYI -- (1) free WiFi available; (2) again, no Turkish/Greek/Arabic coffee here; (3) not surprisingly, no hookah here; (4) outdoor dining available; (5) best tzatziki in the area; (6) AMEX NOT ACCEPTED!

Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)...
- Overall recommendation = 4.25
- Food taste and quality = 3.5 (nothing on their menu's formulaically bland, despite \"what-the-heck\" items like BBQ Wings or Shrimp Po' Boy)
- Portion size = 4
- Price = 4.75 (compared to Greek eatery prices I'm used to seeing, the fact that 100% of the menu is below $8 amazes me...)
- Atmosphere = 4.5 (I hung around studying all afternoon, and the place was at least half full at all times... great music too!)
- General service = 4.75 (my waitress Amber killed it -- in a good way of course)
- Waitstaff = 5
- Location = 4 (nice, visible area... abundant parking)"}
{"text":"Wonderfully fresh and delicious Greek food.  Really enjoyed the gyro and the hand-cut Greek fries, but I think I'm most excited about having fresh dolmades only 5 minutes from our house!  The interior of the restaurant is clean and pretty, with murals of Greece on the walls and Greek music playing. Service is good...what a great addition to Indian Trail!"}
{"text":"Greek salad is awesome. Great price for the amount and quality of the food. Will def come back."}
{"text":"I wish I could say positive things about the food, but the service was so unprofessional that it ruined what could have been an enjoyable evening.   The waiter was young, and made lots of mistakes; the hostess (also young) got into an argument with the waiter in front of our table (including the use of a few swear words in front of our kids). 

Our order was incorrect; we had asked for a salad with no cucumbers, and they made a mistake. We asked them for a fresh salad, and they quickly returned. We asked the waiter directly if \"they had just picked off the cucumbers be brought it back\". He said no, but the first bite of salad had several cucumbers. He admitted he'd lied.  

We asked to see the manager several times, and he never appeared. Highly disappointed; I get that his staff was inexperienced, but he's unable to manage his front of house, then he needs to get someone he can trust."}
{"text":"Really delightful place with great food. I've eaten here a handful of times and it's consistently enjoyable. Usually pretty quiet, so servers are attentive. No complaints."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!! In town for business and ended up eating here two nights in a row! The Buffalo wings and Greek fries are SO good!! If I ever return to Matthews, NC this will be destination #1!!"}
{"text":"My husband & I tried the Athenian Grill tonight for dinner.  The restaurant is bright, cheery, and very clean.  We were greeted & seated right away.  The service was great.  The prices are extremely reasonable and you get a lot for your money.  We both had the Chicken Souvlaki platter with Greek salad & Greek fries.  The tzatziki sauce was really good and fresh and you can tell they make the yummy Greek dressing in house. The warm pita bread is a nice touch.  They also served our baklava warmed which was excellent and very flaky!  The owner came out to speak to us and the wait staff was very friendly and efficient.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We have gone a couple times now. It's sad they aren't busier because this place is great! The food has great flavor and the staff is very nice and efficient!"}
{"text":"We make Athenian Grill a regular stop for our family.  We actually know the wait staff by name and feel like they're our friends.  We've always had great food here!  We prefer it over several other local Greek Restaurants in the area.  It's more authentic overall and frankly tastes better.  One of my favorites is the burger stuffed with w/feta, onions and peppers.  The Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) are the bomb and the best I've ever tasted.  I just wish they had Moussakka.  The owner truly cares about making his patrons happy.  The didn't serve decaf coffee so my husband requested it a couple of times and then wrote it on the back of his check & the next time we visited it was available.  We hope they stay around for a long long time - they're a part of our family tradition."}
{"text":"Nice little place that serves deliciously fresh Greek food at excellent prices.  The service is always very friendly and the restaurant is very clean.  We have never been disappointed here with we have eaten in or taken out.  Great place for that \"ooops...I forgot to take something out for dinner\" night."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the grilled chicken sandwich with Greek fries. Flavor and portions are consistent, which is very important when something becomes your new favorite. Great service, very accommodating staff. :)"}
{"text":"The meal was great authentic Greek food!!! I loved the tzaziki best I've had so far. The portions are big and low prices! I also loved the service everyone was very nice!!! Defiantly going back."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of writting reviews for restaurants but I think this restaurant is kind of an undiscovered Gem. I stopped by after reading so many positive reviews. It did not dissapoint at all, i order the small greek salad and added chicken, it was delicious. Chicken was moist and flavorfull. I went back twice more, being the most recent today 09/03/14. Today i had the chciken Pita Sandwich and the Pita was soft and as great as the chicken. I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"Love their gyros!!! The meat is seasoned perfectly, there cucumber sauce is absolutely delicious. We have only been there twice and have not been disappointed at either visit. The staff is friendly and courteous and the food comes out quick and hot. Their menu is not overwhelming and they have a nice mix of food so even if you are not a fan of Greek food, there is something on their menu for everyone in the family to be able to enjoy. They are also very kid friendly. The restaurant is very clean as well as the bathrooms. I would recommend that anybody who lives in the Matthews, Indian trail area should definitely stop in one day and give this place a try. You can either eat in or take out."}
{"text":"The waiter was really kind and very professional and the food was pretty great! But the atmosphere is the only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 5, they really need to work on making this place a bit more attractive. Get rid of the fake flowers and the noticeable screws on the fake brick wall. Also, not sure who picked the music when we were there but it had a very strange mellow sound to it, didn't feel too happy."}
{"text":"Storefront restaurant with very casual atmosphere. Food is good; the usual Greek fair gyros, souvlaki, Greek salad, baklava, etc. l like the Greek chicken, salad and rice. You can order double meat on the gyro and have a 2nd lunch for yourself-the sandwich is huge. 

Service is quick and the prices are fair to low."}
{"text":"We love greek food, especially a really good gyro. This is a REALLY good Gyro. For the same price as fast food we got healthy deliciousness. My 11 year old got a salad and wants to make sure we rave about the house thousand island and that the fries are also great dipped in it. (Similar to Utah Fry sauce which is magic) The food was fresh and hot the staff super friendly. So much so my introvert husband had to make a point to seek out the manager and thank him for the whole experience. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, but don't eat in.......order out only.  Everythings dirty.  Even after the waiter wiped the table, your arms and hands would stick to it.  Such a shame because the wait staff was friendly and helpful.  I moved to 3 different tables and they were all dirty."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to get a reasonably priced meal that is fresh and tasty.  Really glad I found this place.  Owner is very nice and I really wish them all the success because I hope to make this my go to restaurant for girl's nights and family nights."}
{"text":"I had lamb, kind of a gyro but under a different name. The meat was very good but the pita was a little stale, unfortunately. My husband had the fish sandwich. He thought it was good but not amazing. My biggest complaint would be the stickiness of the place. Floors, tables, and booths were just sticky. 
I'd have their food again, but I'd do takeout."}
{"text":"Gyro was awesome.  Spanakopita was great.  Waitress was very friendly.  We will be back."}
{"text":"In Indian Trail for a basketball tournament, I quick checked Yelp for nearby good restaurants and picked this unpretentious little Greek restaurant for dinner just one short mile away. Since we're down here most weekends I consider this a great new find!

First, this place is ridiculously affordable.  My dinner was $7.95!  Second it's got an overall 4.5 star rating for good reason. Third, our server Quinn was a delight. Helpful throughout, he was pleased to give recommendations when I accepted his offer (who else knows the food as well as the employees?)

I went with his favorite, the Athens Gyro Platter which was gyro (lamb, I'd imagine) meat on a pita with a side of delicious tzatziki, Greek salad and my choice of side. Quinn had mentioned earlier that the fries were seasoned with the same Greek seasonings as the wings so I tried them... yum!!!!!  I'd never get plain fries again. $7.95

My husband went with the chicken pita which was grilled chicken, tomatoes, onions, tzatziki and also chose the fries. $6.25

I also ordered the Horiatiki Village Greek Salad as an appetizer to share which is a lettuce-less salad of tomato, cucumber, red onion, green peppers, feta, black olives and three dolmades which are rice-stuffed grape leaves. I've had them before when they are super-piquant and these were happily a little less so which meant my husband enjoyed them also. Plus it came with warm pita triangles which were just yummy. $6.55

We tried the baklava (the only thing I forgot to take a picture of but someone else did) and it was warm!!  Absolutely delicious and only $3.25!!! 

All the servers checked in on us at least once. Quinn was great. I wish we had this place up at Lake Norman but since we don't I'll have to come back on some future tournament weekends. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Serving sizes are huge, prices are incredibly reasonable. Our food arrived quickly. Loved every bite! Their pita bread is soft, fresh and delicious. Eat here soon and often!"}
{"text":"Very good, authentic Greek cuisine. Owner is always there when we go. Nice atmosphere and friendly service. They put together family dinners for me to take out at last minute, which I appreciated. Good value for fresh, quality ingredients."}
{"text":"A noon client cancelled so I figured it was a great time to try this relatively new spot a co-worker raved about.

The establishment is rather small but cutely decorated with Greek-inspired artifacts. A young host greeted me and showed me where to place my take-out order. The menu has all of the popular traditional Greek items, from gyro pitas to greek salads to souvlaki. I am a shrimp lover and chose a grilled shrimp pita, no veggies. The host-turned-server suggested the fries for my side so I went with it. 

I didn't open the box on my way back to the office but the aroma coming from it was wonderful. When I finally opened the box back at the office, I was astonished at the portion size for less than $8. My pita was LOADED with grilled shrimp. I was expecting maybe 5, 8 if I was lucky. The tzatziki was delicious although next time I will ask them to go a little lighter on it. I see why he suggested fries! I was determined not to even eat them but once I saw them, I tasted one...then two. Ok....I probably ate about 10. No idea what the seasoning was on them but it was awesome. 

Above all, the sanitation rating was 99.5. 

Great food, fast service and friendly staff help this spot get 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times & think the place is great.  Food is always fresh & tasty.  Service is always good.  And it's affordable."}
{"text":"It is what it is...and that is a not very fancy but very good Greek restaurant that very well priced and is much needed for the Indian Trail area. The hummus, gyro and baklava were all very good and some of the best tzatziki sauce I've had.  Very friendly...even the cook, who I think is the owner thanked us for coming.  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
