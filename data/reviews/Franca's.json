{"text":"A really quaint and tidy little Italian cafe, that specializes in catering.  The Mochaccino is flavorful and beautiful.  Pleasant staff and wonderful service.  Some interesting gifts as well."}
{"text":"Franca's is a little Italian jewel in an industrial area. Went for a weekday lunch and had the gnocchi which was perfectly done by Franca's husband. He knows what he's doing and cares a lot about the quality of food he produces out of their kitchen. I don't usually ever get a dessert but was intrigued by what they call Peaches. These are an artful creation that look like a peach but is actually cake with a dark filling to mimic a peach pit. Franca is very nice and took the time to show us photos of events she has been hosting there at the restaurant. She does an incredible job of transforming the restaurant into whatever the clients are seeking. It was a good thing we got there early because the place became packed out. Given the location, I was rather surprised by how busy it had become. By the time I was finished my meal, I understood. This place is a standout."}
{"text":"Very nice and innovative way to cater to their clients 
My second time there, will try again ."}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing, Franca and her family are super friendly and the food is true authentic Italian food. Trust me I am Italian I know what I am talking about. You have to go, she is now open Saturdays for dinner and OH MY GOD is it amazing, screw some fancy pants place, bring your loved one or even your family on a dinner here and your pants will be blown off from the food to the atmospher. Franca's is a must go...."}
{"text":"We were passing through town and just happened to drop in for lunch and had the most amazing meal ever. We were welcomed in as family and my only regret is there is not one of these in Nashville Tennessee."}
{"text":"Some jerk smashed my car window, which lucky for me, I got to discover Franca's as a result. Franca's is in a rather industrial area along Edmonton trail with several mechanic and auto glass shops near by, so if you break down or some sad lowlife breaks your car window to steal $2.73-ish in change make sure you go to a place that's near Franca's.

They've changed the layout from a coffee shop to more of a restaurant feel with table service. They're still happy to have you hang out and have a coffee, but I'd recommend you stick around for lunch as well. 

I had an arugula salad with chicken. It was simple and delicious. When you're working with ingredients like olive oil, parmesan, sea salt, balsamic, and arugula, you don't need much more - but quality goes a really long way. What a smashing salad... And that reminds me of my car window again. What a jerk. 

Franca's comes across as a solid Italian restaurant run by a really nice family. I don't know if it's family owned but it feels that way. Its the type of restaurant you could bring your entire family to for a great meal.

Hopefully someone slits my tire soon because I'm eager to head back to Franca's for the dinner experience."}
{"text":"Met my girlfriend here for a coffee around lunch time. After looking at the menu we decided to stay for lunch. I had the special which was a chicken breast with penne. The chicken was flavourful and tender. The penne was okay with a red sauce. the meal didn't come with a vegetable or salad. 

The price seemed on the high side, so a salad or vegetable would have added a bit more value.

At one point there was a meal being set up for a group of six. I noticed their table had two big bowls of salad, so there was salad available.

I also ordered an espresso - 'cause that's what I do - I sample espresso wherever I go!

It was somewhat bitter. I think there was way too much water for an espresso. The espresso cup was big and it was almost full. 

Overall, it was a nice surprise to find this restaurant in this area. Certainly a bonus for any business people looking for a nice place to eat in an industrial area."}
{"text":"Franca's is a hidden gem in Calgary and known to the Italian local community apparently. My company's owner is Italian and we hired Franca's to cater a lunch event with only two days notice. We had:

- Caprese salad
- Mixed greens with balsamic dressing
- Rigatoni with bolognese sauce
- Chicken and mushrooms in a wine sauce 
- Large shrimp with garlic sauce 
- Green beans with silvered almonds
- Vanilla chocolate cake with raspberry icing 
- Strawberry shortcake 

Everything was surprisingly delicious even though it was made in large quantities. The tables were set up with table clothes and cutlery and they were prompt and ready to go by lunch time. 

I've never heard about Franca's before until now but I'll have to stop by their restaurant some time. They are the real deal!!"}
{"text":"Updated, clean and really great food. We had the caprese salad and veal meatball appetizer. Great flavors and service."}
{"text":"5-stars for being so unexpectedly pleasant in an industrial area just off Edmonton Trail. I headed in search of a new coffee shop today to hang out in. I figured I'd drive up to an area I hadn't been in for awhile, pull up Yelp and see what showed up for coffee shops. Enter Franca's! I looked at the building and wondered what I was in store for. From the outside, I was thinking maybe it would be a cute little hole-in-the-wall. Instead, I walked into a well-decorated little cafe. 8 or 9 tables, dark floors and furniture, a little kitchen in the back and a menu with paninis, soups, dessert, coffee and tea.

I settled in by the window with my laptop after ordering this ridiculously yummy looking peach dessert and an Americano. The peach is light and moist with a pudding filling and a dusting of sugar on the exterior. And my Americano? Smooth.

Pop in for lunch or an afternoon coffee and snack if you're in the area. Come when it's quiet and you might just be the only non-Italian in the place... like I was this afternoon!

PS... wifi, they've got it!"}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: This is one of the best Italian places I've been to in a while. The service goes above and beyond almost anything I've experienced elsewhere, and the food is absolutely delectable.

Try:
Gnocchi Della Mamma
Penne Arrabiata
Linguini Con Scampi
Beef Fillet with Roasted Peppers (special of the day)

Pro:
The restaurant has a clean, welcoming look that is not evident from the outside. The service is extremely personal, with the restaurant owners providing recommendations themselves. The beef was thick, juicy, and very well prepared. The gnocchi was delightful, with just the right amount of sauce, soft and tasty.

Con:
The penne was simply alright, and that comes from an arrabiata afficionado. Not enough to ding the restaurant significantly, still highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Franca herself sat with us and discussed catering a charcuterie plate for after our mother's funeral. She made great suggestions and customized the plate for our taste. She was very kind and the restaurant was clean and romantic. I am looking forward to trying Franca's for lunch or dinner, the menu looks amazing! - will update once charcuterie plate is received but based on our first experience I'm sure it will be amazing!"}
