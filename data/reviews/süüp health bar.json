{"text":"Really was not a fan of this place. I bought a green soup and it had no flavour, tasted like it was made with water instead of veggie broth maybe? It was all I tried so I cannot speak to the other menu options, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic soup and absolutely amazing atomic sushi bowl!

I really like the Thai butternut and the Thai coconut soups - perfectly seasoned and really hearty. The price point is only about a dollar more than Tim Hortons and far superior in quality. 

The bowl was a surprise hit - the wasabi flavoured dressing is perfect. Not overbearing and very savoury. Hearty meal with lots of soy protein. 

Also it's all vegan. That's a huge plus."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's enough to know that I won't be returning.

I was excited to hear a plant based restaurant had opened up close to work, however I've tried the Thai Crunch Salad and one of the soups and they were both pretty meh. The marinated soy protein is quite boring to eat, especially considering the price. I can't find the soup I had on the online menu but it lacked flavour.

This restaurant does not do plant based cooking justice. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Finally an affordable delicious Vegan option in the downtown core! Courteous service and a great variety of vegan/vegetarian soups, salads and wraps! BTW this location is not closed just walk further back beside the construction area beside the coffee shop! The one downside is they're hours. I was looking forward to getting supper there last week and when I got there I saw they close at 6pm! Maybe 7pm but 6pm is way too early to close shop on a weekday in the downtown core! What about customers who wanna grab supper after work?!"}
{"text":"I tried the vegan pulled pork burrito bowl, which does not taste like pulled pork, but it tasted good regardless, so I still enjoyed it. The moringa protein balls are good too."}
{"text":"I had the Southwestern TexMex Burrito. It was tasty, very filling (I couldn't finish it all) and great value for money."}
{"text":"I really like soup and I really like salad.
Suup does have both of these things!

However I find the portions are very small based on my salad takeout order.
The small soup looks almost kid sized.

For $8-9, I basically got lettuce with hemp seeds. Some avocado but it's was not very substantial. Tasty and fresh but I needed another lunch. U_U"}
{"text":"Came across this hidden gem by chance because of a coupon. Tried the unlobster brisk to see how you can recreate a traditional lobster brisk to vegetarian friendly. Was told they used a traditional northern lobster mushroom to make the soup. It was surprisingly amazing! 8 oz of soup will run you at $4.95. If you are looking for a healthy alternative to a quick meal, give this place a chance. Staff is very friendly with soup, salad, and wrap options to choose from."}
{"text":"Great soups, salads ++ innovative delicious dishes.  Vegan! Wonderful.  A hidden gem off Yonge Street on the North side of the Aura skyscraper.  I teach evenings- so I pop in around 5 for a delicious meal that keeps me going through the evening! They give points to regulars. Good smoothies too."}
{"text":"I like to think of Suup as the minimalist version of urban herbivore, and the vegan version of freshii. The storefront is tucked at the inner corner of the building, so foot traffic is a bit slow (especially with current construction at college park). 

Their bowls are generously portioned with veggies, brown rice, and soy strips. They definitely do not skimp on the soy strips! Unfortunately, the food here lacks the flavour punch and variety of veggie goodness that you get at urban herbivore. I would like to see them add more variation in the contents of their bowls, as the ones I tried tasted pretty similar and contained the same veggies.

The smoothies here are pretty good, with exotic sounding additions (like sea buckthorn and maca)."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am not a vegan nor requiring of a gluten-free diet. That being said, I do not subscribe to the meaningless hype of \"all things vegan and gluten-free must automatically mean they're better options\".

So yes, this place is completely vegan + gluten-free, which I think is great for those who choose veganism/have gluten intolerance, but for my review, I will be comparing the quality of their soup with any other meatless soups that I would find elsewhere. But sidenote: yay that they use local ingredients!  
So today, I tried the thai butternut squash soup and it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. Granted, it was kept extremely hot and my tummy sure loved the warmth, but I felt that the soup was lacking in flavour and texture. When I think \"butternut squash\", I personally think of a more viscous and pulpy soup that really embodies the delicious starchy aspect of squash. This soup was more runny and the flavour was very.. singular. I could just taste one distinct kick as opposed to a blend of \"fall spices\" that you would normally expect from a bright orange soup. I mean, overall, the soup was fine. It wasn't the deliciousness that I was hoping for, but it wasn't bad either. 

Also, the employees were super nice and helpful with explaining the soups (though I find it off-putting that the menu doesn't specify what ingredients are in each soup in the first place)."}
{"text":"The food is fairly good here, the service is poor. To the point where they don't say \"Hello\" or \"Thank You.\" First time I came here I ordered via an app. They made my meal wrong and the wait was about twenty minutes (no other customers). Second time, my food sat on the counter unnecessarily for about ten minutes (I was waiting in the store) while the employees dawdled about. It was cold by the time I got to my office. Time is money and if they don't respect my time they won't be seeing much more of my money."}
{"text":"Tried out this new place. Tested out a couple of soups before buying one. They were all ....meh.... I was starving so chose to the carrot coconut ginger soup. Where was the ginger? Soup was bland. No salt or anything. It took me 45 minutes to eat a small. I didn't want to waste it....$6+ for a small soup!!! I saw they had health bowls but did not try. I was very disappointed in their soups :(. Too bad because I love soup!!!! I was so disappointed I will not go back there."}
{"text":"Offering pots and pots of piping hot soup that is 100% vegan and gluten friendly. 

Just in time to keep you warm and toasty on those cold Toronto nights. 

Tried the un-lobster bisque which uses mushrooms and kelp stock to recreate the flavours.  It is hearty although doesnt quite hit the mark for me. #omnivore

I settled for the thai curry coconut and lime soup.  Great flavours with lots of vegetables which makes me smile. 

This is a great lunch spot abd can see myself making the walk for healthier lunch option."}
{"text":"I like vegan food and tried being an exclusive one for a while, so I love trying new vegan restaurants. Süüp, however, was kind of disappointing in that the salads are pretty basic, ie. I could probably assemble something similar on a college student budget. I ordered the calci-yum salad $8 with protein (soy strips) with a small cravin' comfort soup as well as a slice of lemon, tofu-based vegan cheesecake $5 from the Feedback app. The salad again was pretty simple and small. The soups are promising - Cravin Comfort is one of their chunkier ones, with lots of winter root vegetables and potatoes. I also sampled the Thai butternut squash soup, which I didn't like as much because it was way too watery. Unfortunately the serving sizes here are much smaller than what you might find at other salad/vegan places, but the prices here are also much lower. The cheesecake was the highlight, obviously :P It actually tasted like real cheesecake, though a bit less sweet, which I found more palatable.

The staff here are really nice and I appreciate how patient they were with me wanting to try different soups and all my questions about ingredients. Some of them are probably new to the team or something because it sounded like there was a bit of confusion in the kitchen when putting together my salad. They also forgot to add on the soy strips I ordered :'(

Overall, while the food at Süüp is nothing spectacular, it is fast, cheap, and vegan. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came a few minutes before closing and the guys were nice enough to still process my order. I got the Alaskan sushi bowl. Overall the bowl is good, and salty enough that I don't think the soy sauce is necessary. 

Also, the price is comparable to most healthy takeouts and I appreciate that the container is not styrofoam."}
{"text":"A nice healthy food joint located in the College Park area. It's a little bit hidden as it's off the main street. Came here to pick up a Mealpal order. I ordered the West Indian Jerk. It was basically pieces of jerk chicken and some coleslaw in a salad. I was a bit early to pickup the order so it wasn't ready so the staff person had to make it there when I arrived. It was a pretty delicious meal for something so healthy. 
Overall, it was a pretty good meal. They could of have added more servings of the dish but not a bad dish overall. Stop by here if you want a healthy meal!"}
{"text":"I like that they don't use aluminum foil, Teflon®, or other unhealthy materials in food prep. Some of their food is organic. If I could find an ingredient menu, I could perhaps give four stars, but they swear that they don't use nutritional yeast, which is a good start.

food: the calci yum salad was pretty good, with roasted veg, quinoa on salad with a few canellini beans and mostly salad. just enough tahini dressing, but i'd add some tagine spices to it to pop the flavour. 4/5

the ceasar salad was less oily than the LIVE® offering, except i have no idea what was in the GF croutons, and they tasted unsprouted, so i picked them off. 2.5/5

the greenhouse raw had 1 piece of avocado + one baby tomato, with no zingy lemon salad dressing -- just oil. 2/5

powerhouse salad 4/5. good and as described.

TexMex Burrito Bowl. I don't eat rice so I asked for none -- but the whole thing was 90% rice, 6 black beans, no discernible avocado, a few pieces of tomato instead of salsa fresca. the soy strips were not spiced but just too sweet and plentiful. Add at least ¼ c salsa Fresca, half an avocado, some fresh cilantro and flavour and you'l be close to getting somewhere. utterly disappointing. 1/5

the Thai and spicy squash soup were 3.5/5 stars each and i'd order them again. i'd addd thai basil to the Thai one, tho.

i like the emphasis on raw in the salads i got, with ccooked extras added so as to fit an 80/20 diet. you could almost fit an 80/10/10 diet too.

this is the healthiest take-out i've found in the downtown core besides Cruda Café. Offerings could be further refined for flavours and quality, but great start."}
{"text":"Some of the food is pretty tasty, some is a tad bland. Good selection of items though, and good service.

Not a lot of vegan alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food. 

The Thai Crunch salad was great and even the small serving was more than enough for me."}
{"text":"I didn't 'love' the West Indian Jerk burrito taste wise but I sure loved the fact that it was vegan! And it was a filling breakfast. I do love Cole slaw and theirs was good tasting. 

The entrance to this place is NOT on Yonge but just off it. Make a left into the street now being used for construction and you will see the door. It is not in the mall of the food court."}
{"text":"It's not really interesting? I truly don't like being a hater as this establishment seems wholesome and has good intentions. It's just another salad place tho, big whoop. I will, however say their selection of soups caught the twinkle in my eye. I hope they improve their aesthetic and competitive advantages over time."}
{"text":"The Calci-yum didn't look like much once I opened the box, but it was really good I must say. The dressing is amazing and it went well with the ingredients. I left out cranberries so I don't know how it would taste with it, but glad I got this salad. It was quite filling too. Great job on the dressing guys one of the best I ever had :)"}
