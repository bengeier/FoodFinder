{"text":"Service was great! Food was okay. Considering we spent about $500, we didn't really eat much. Great for meetings/showing off but if you're hungry; you better have a fat wallet or a few credit cards to get a full stomach. ;)"}
{"text":"Fantastic!   We were seated promptly upon entry - the restaurant was very spacious and beautifully decorated. We ordered 2 snow crabs for 10 dollars each (unbelievable price), 9 piece salmon and beef sashimi and the $38 course set meal for two. The sashimi was just AMAZING. I could really taste the quality in it - we talked to our server, and she mentioned that they had master chefs from Japan making their sushi. Although the selection is limited, the quality of what they have will truly blow your mind away. Our waiter was quite helpful, asking us if it was our first time at the restaurant and guiding us through the options. Overall a great experience, will be taking our friends to eat here :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my family and we ordered the lobster combo both times. While it is slightly pricey, I think it's worth it! The lobster sashimi is always heavenly and fresh, the tempura is perfectly fried, the rolls are really nice, and the udon noodles are thick and has the perfect texture.   The interior is spacious and clean and the customer service is great. They always knew what we wanted before we even asked for them (e.g tea refills or an extra bowl).   Will be back soon to try another combo."}
{"text":"My husband and I together with another couple, went to this restaurant a few months ago. I think it was the inauguration month of the restaurant. The menu was a prefix for two persons. Okay so we ordered 2 prefix (ie for 4 persons) around $60 per person (tax and tips extra).  When we first entered the restaurant, the place gave me an impression of a university canteen with tables and chairs all lined up. I thought the price shouldn't be too much as it has an inexpensive setup. Wrong! We were told that there is only set dinner for 2 (wonder what would happen if we come in odd number, like 3 people). What the hack! We're there already.  The food quality is so so. Pardon my knowledge in seafood. The crabs were small and meatless. I personally prefer King Crab. The waitress put up a show to demonstrate how to hold on to the miniature crab leg to cook it in the soup. The shabu shabu ingredients were skimpy with less than enough vegetables and only a small portion of noodles. I really can't comment on how good or bad the food is because there just wasn't enough food going through my palette!   $300 later (for the 4 of us), we were still hungry and went to McDonald's for burgers which had never tasted that good. Not that we wanted to go to McD, it's because the dinner dragged on so long (with so little food in very small portions) and most restaurants were closed by the time we finished.   By the way, at this price and with this little food, I would expect the waitress to replenish my plate. She didn't. When we requested, she pointed to the bin next to the table to signal us to empty our plate and reuse it. I saw that each table has a little bin on the side. Very gross and unhygenic! Will never go back and already spread the word to my friends not to be \"scammed\" by this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had to wait for  more than 50 minutes until our crab lunch combo was there. Very salty steam egg. Got cold crab legs instead of grilled crabs on the menu. Was told no manager/supervisor during the lunch. Very disappointed! Would not go again."}
{"text":"Visited Crab Harbour in early August, I was excited to see a restaurant severing Japanese style crab cuisine in Toronto.  The restaurant is nicely decorated but services have a lot of room for improvement.  Most servers were very new, but that's understandable as the restaurant was just newly opened when I visited.  There were about 9 courses in the set meal.   The steamed crab egg custard was done perfectly and Shabu Shabu is a nice way to taste the sweetness of the crab meat.  However, other courses started to give similar taste even they were prepared in different ways.  It may be better if the meal is shared by 3 or more people, otherwise portion may be too big."}
{"text":"This is a great place for crabs and more. Very spacious, lots of varieties on the menu and there are special dinner sets that offer many courses at a good price.  For 1st timers here and not sure what to order, I suggest picking a dinner set and try a bit of everything. Mind you though, the portions are huge, make sure you have an empty stomach so that you can enjoy all you eat.  The whole snow crab served cold with vinegar is so sweet, I just like it by itself. Chawanmushi well made, smooth and tasty, I just wish they put the ginkgo in as well. First time ever to taste crab leg tempura, not bad at all! Crab leg sushi with crab paste is something to try as well. There is also a grilled crab leg dish that smells really good and taste the same. However, you might want to skip the sashimi platter, it is not quite impressive. The sukiyaki is way too sweet for me but that's sukiyaki, it's not that a dish gone wrong. Dinner sets also comes with some cold dishes and serve ice cream as dessert.  Overall, it's a satisfying dinner experience, especially with the price I paid."}
{"text":"The king crab meal is fabulous! That's why they call themselves \"Crab Harbor\". Sashimi and sushi are quite good and fresh, above the average of GTA. The beef sukiyaki, Hotpot, is also great. PS: the environment reminds me of the fascinating restaurants in Japan. Totally, it is great and beyond my expectation, so I give a \"Five Star\"!"}
{"text":"You should know what you're getting... Crabs  You can see the sign from the street, a large crab... reminiscent of the ones on Dotonbori Street in Osaka, Japan, and with a name like Crab Harbour, there is little confusion as to what you would get at this establishment. You enter into a large foyer greeted by a large screen, showing notices/banners or playing movies, in my case, Source Code. Colourful murals cover the private rooms, a panoramic view of Hwy7 in the dining area, funky lighting fixtures. We were promptly seated and notified that due to the soft opening, they only had the set meal items available. Out of lack of selection, we ordered the set meal consisting of 3 crabs done 3 ways with some extras. We were forewarned that the crabs may be overweight and that we would have to pay for the extra if they were. Sure enough, they were.   First course was a boiled-then-chilled crab with some sort of citrus dipping sauce. Points for having all the legs precut for easy consumption. The crab arrived with some Japanese pickles, seaweed and the crab guts neatly scooped into little cups. Crab was fresh and tasty, but after a few legs, I could tell I was already nearing my limit of crustacean consumption. Before we finished the crab, they were already bringing out other dishes: A large sashimi leg and shrimp and vegetable tempura.   Slowly the first crab course was disappearing, leg by leg. As the aforementioned dishes were devoured, the BBQ crab was brought out along with a crab chawanmushi. Another whole crab... Much of the same, but hot or warm, and no sauce. As I was forcing down crab legs, I kept my eyes on the screen. I couldn't help but feel a parallel between the movie and my dining experience... eating crab again and again and again.   The next course was crab shabu shabu. A welcome sight as the crab pieces were accompanied by vegetables, mushrooms, tofu, and some noodles, not just crab. As the golden broth comes to a boil, the waitress teaches us how to cook the remaining crab legs to our liking. After the legs are done, the remaining crab parts and the rest of the ingredients are thrown into the pot. The broth was fairly good, chicken stock by my guess... Greatly improved after all the other things are thrown in. The meal also comes with a final serving of udon noodles or rice. Opted for noodles, but didn't finish due to very full.   The meal finished with a scoop of ice cream (not crab flavoured unfortunately). Green tea, red bean or vanilla.   Service was fairly good, you can tell they try, but the wait staff is largely untrained. The two qualms I have are the pacing of the dishes and that the crabs were not accompanied with a variety of other items/flavours. If you've been to the King Crab restaurant in Osaka, then you may be disappointed but will probably still go because it's the closest thing we have to it. If you haven't then it's worth a try, especially if you're a fan of crab.   ATMOSPHERE: Better for larger parties  SERVICE: Attentive and unexperienced  SOUND LEVEL: Low-moderate  RECOMMENDED: Crab?  PRICES: ~$55/person on set meal for 2. Total came to about $160"}
{"text":"4 of us came here for lunch looking forward to the snow crab hotpot, we found out after we sat down that they were sold out of snow crab and won't be replenished for another week (so half of the menu was not available, kind of ridiculous for a restaurant that mainly sells crab). We ordered 3 crab lunch set and 1 pork cutlet lunch set. The pork cutlet set was the first to arrive , as my sister started eating her meal - in fact she already finished the sashimi, the waiter came back after realizing that set was meant for the table behind us, he took her meal that she was already eating and gave it to the table behind us. We were shocked, we just came and took away her food without saying a word!  Our food slowly arrive after but 1 set was missing, after a while we decided to follow up with the waiter where is the last lunch set. He told us that we only asked for 3 lunch set in total (when there clearly was 4 people of us) and that he didn't take the order wrong.   The bento box style lunch ended up being 2 hours long, of course they didn't comp anything. One of the more senior waitress apologized for the waiter's behaviour because she is frustrated with him as well.  For me to witness the food that we were already eating being taken away and brought to a different table is horrifying.  Food is alright, for the price you can get better seafood with better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here at 11:40am for lunch as it stated on website to be open at 11:30. And was turned away disappointed since they where closed. A sign on the door said closed for the day but signed 3 days ago."}
{"text":"Wow what a great deal. Fresh delicious seafood for great prices.  Had the dinner 6 person 10lb lobster set meal with 2 crabs, fried rice with crab, chawanmushi, lobster sashimi, tako wasabi, lobster hot pot and edamame.  All that food for only $198!!  The live lobster was brought to the table before cooking so you know it is fresh.   Thought every dish tasted good and was very impressed with the steamed crab and lobster sashimi.  Service was also very good and they accommodated all our requests.  Would readily come back again and will definitely try this place out for lunch as well"}
{"text":"Food 2.5/5 (50% of final grade)  We ordered the multi-course meal combos and it was nothing spectacular. The crab and lobster didn't taste especially fresh or succulent. At the end of the day, there is nothing spectacular with the variety of tastes in the menu. Everything ends up tasting more or less like sashimi after a while.  Ambiance 3/5 (15% of final grade)  The interior decorating was obviously worked on, because it felt clean, trendy, and casual-classy (if that was ever a thing). However, this is more of a New Year's dinner type of place, and not a date place. Though the interior was pretty nice, and there were big windows that gave the place an elevated feeling (because the plaza is on top of a small hill), the place still felt simply like an AYCE sushi place with a bit more class.  Service 3/5 (15% of final grade)  Though it was a Saturday night, it was pretty empty (a bad sign, usually). There were many staff members who were simply standing around doing nothing, which is fine by me, so long as service is being delivered well. Perhaps due to the traffic, the staff members were extra attentive, always on the look out for finished dishes. It felt like they were taking away the dishes a little too quickly sometimes though, as if they were ushering one phase of the menu to another phase.   Cost 1.5/5 (10% of final grade)  $250 for a dinner for three that was at an AYCE level of quality? No thank-you.   Other 1/5 (10% of final grade)  Brownie point level! There was a server that was trying to build rapport with us -- it was sort of nice to have some small talk going on between the server and us. The effort of wanting to connect with customers at all other than the standard taking away of the dishes is already hard to come by in East-Asian establishments, I find.  Final Grade = 48/100 = 2 Stars  Summary: Nothing special. Don't bother visiting if you are looking for quality seafood for a reasonable price. This place is normal seafood for its astronomical price. With respect with the area in which this restaurant is situated in, I'm pretty sure there are superior establishments."}
{"text":"Service, food presentation,atmosphere and food itself is wonderful! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The experience is good for groups because of the space and also the amount of food. We did the meal set 6 but for 7 people. More than enough. Fun to see all the ways the crab and lobster is prepped. The egg soup thing was very good and I've never seen anything like it! If you like omei and Fishman clubhouse bc you like lobster comas, try this place out for a different menu type of menu."}
{"text":"The food here is quite the bargain for the price. My boyfriend and I ordered the snow crab and beef set. For this meal, you get two and a half snow crabs (one as a whole crab, one with the hot pot and half as a tempura dish). The tempura was over-battered, but that was really the only thing I could complain about.  The atmosphere is really quite beautiful and the service is very quick. The crabs are flown in live from either the East coast of Canada or directly from Japan, which I thought was amazing. This is likely the freshest crab that you will get in Ontario as the majority of it is cook from frozen.   Crab Harbour is actually a Japanese franchise and this one in Markham is the first in North America. The cooks care a great deal about the food and the quality of ingredients that go into each dish, which really impresses me and makes me feel good about dining there."}
{"text":"Presentation was ok, but service was bad. Got a feeling they want to get rid of us as soon as possible. We ordered the set dinner. Keep bring out food even ask for delay till we done our first course. End up foods are cold & lost the taste. Also, very limited menu."}
{"text":"I'm confused about the reviews here.  This restaurant may have some grandiose exterior, but once you get past the hostess, it's nothing special.  A restaurant that wants to charge minimum of $200 per group meal, better have the best selection of seafood and the best service available.    Typically in a Chinese seafood restaurant, one would see large tanks with lively seafood in them. In this restaurant I had to venture near the washroom to find two relatively small tanks with somewhat dead lobsters and crabs.  We ordered the $200, cash only, special which was to include Alaskan King crab.  We were served with several courses all of which were done with a great level of service.  However I was disappointed with pretty much every dish. There was absolutely no seasoning in any dish. Two of the dishes included a custard that was void of any flavour.  All the seafood was basically steamed, yet with absolutely no sign of herbs or flavoring.  They may have a great presence with the exterior of the restaurant, but there are far better Chinese seafood restaurants in the immediate vicinity.  Sidenote-this restaurant is not truly a Chinese restaurant, it is a mix mash of Chinese and Japanese. When you order a pre-fix menu, you will get some courses that are sushi, which is not traditionally prepared."}
{"text":"Everything can possibly goes wrong in this restaurant has gone wrong.  1.  Food is below average.  Crab is not fresh.  If you try to imitate a Japanese restaurant, the least you need to do is use Japanese sticky rice instead of chinese jasmine rice.    2.  Waitress is very inexperienced.   Even there were only 3 tables with customers in the entire restaurant, still manage to give bad service.   Poor attitude.   3.  Tables with glass top is not clean, it's greasy to the touch.  Light fixtures have ducts all over,  kind of gross to look at.  4.  Poor choice of music and volumn way too high. Unless you're a big fan of the 80's, I guarantee you will have urges to put on shouder pads and a pair of leg warmer if u know what I mean."}
{"text":"Our waitress was super friendly and knew what to recommend. I'd suggest getting the lobster sashimi rather than the crab sashimi. Their whole snow crab was delicious."}
{"text":"The cold whole crab is great and if you love crab meat. You will like this. It might be required some effort to get get the meat  Lunch special: cooked crab legs are not as good as cold one. Sashimi is fresh.  The seafood smell is obviously not sure if the restaurant is doing necessary cleaning and freshness.  The tank seems to be small by the washroom not sure if it's the best location for the seafood."}
{"text":"The cholesterol intake at Crab Harbour is definitely worth it. We ordered two sets of the summer dinner combo here.  DRINKS White wine  APPETIZERS Crab leg & Salad Edamame  WHOLE SNOW CRAB The display of the crab reminds me of the ones in Osaka, it's pretty. It's served cold with two side mini bowls of \"crab fat\" - soo delicious. It tastes even better when you dip this with the vinegar sauce.  LOBSTER SASHIMI This is a 5/5. It is refreshing and sweet. I think they chopped up the smaller lobster for the sashimi but the portions were huge - loved this! Will definitely order it again when I revisit.  STONE-POT LOBSTER I believe this was marinated with just salt - was super full by the time we ate this but delicious nonetheless.  SNOW CRAB & FRIED RICE They cooked the fried rice with the crab fat, which was such an awesome combo. Smelt and tasted very good.  STEAMED LOBSTER PASTE CUSTARD SOUP 5/5 stars. Highly recommending this - they steamed this custard with mushrooms, small portions of seafood (mussels, calamari, shrimp etc.) and a lot of lobster paste (so much cholesterol but so worthy :D).  LOBSTER SHABU SHABU Lobster hot pot with clear soup. This dish is where they can improve on. The soup base was kind of plain. I guess after such a strong tasting meal, they wanted to end off with something more on the healthy side haha.  DESSERTS: A selection of green tea / red bean / mango ice cream."}
{"text":"Decent...But I have had better... Also the pricing is above average for the same type of food.  Been here twice.  Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was quite excited to visit Crab Harbour after hearing so much about it and seeing some awesome pictures from this restaurant. I finally decided to come here with my family earlier this month, on a very cold day mind you.  We noticed the restaurant was quite empty when we arrived at around 8pm, but didn't really think much of it...it was a cold and icy night after all, so we assumed many stayed home.  After looking at the menu, we were set to order the Asahi meal, as that one had the most crab...until the restaurant told us that they only had the snow crab, egg custard, and the grilled crab paste available! For a restaurant that's supposed to be known for crab, I found the lack of crab options to be a bit disappointing, but regardless we ordered the sukiyaki beef hotpot and added the grilled crab paste as a side.  The snow crab came first, and I must say for the disappointment we've had so far that night, the snow crab was actually quite meaty and delicious. The sauce that came with the snow crab is also quite refreshing. The grilled crab paste was uniquely presented and tasted very good as well. However, the egg custard wasn't anything special, as well as the sashimi (but hey, I kinda expected that anyway).  Finally, the sliced beef...was decent. They were cut a little too thick, but the quality was there overall. The sukiyaki broth was also quite sweet, which I definitely like as that's what the broth is supposed to be. The udon was the sanuki kind, so hey at least they didn't cheap out on the noodles!  Service fluctuated wildly, depending on who was delivering the meal. One of the servers was excellent in taking down our order and explaining what was and wasn't available, while another seemed to be paying more attention to the employees having dinner than our table, as that person kept ignoring our pleas for service.  Will I return? Well, apparently the reason why there were so few crab options was because of shipping costs and recent snowstorm in the Atlantic...so maybe a summer visit would generate better luck for me."}
{"text":"Crab is somewhat hard to eat (the flash doesn't come out straight but rather stuck on the shells). Server is busy and not seen though half of the hall is empty during lunch rush  on a sunday. Wasn't informed of extra charge of the \"overweight\" of the carb. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Had the king crab set for 5ppl and we ordered 1 dozen of oyster which were very small and 2.5$ each They add udon in the steamed egg which makes the bowl looks larger but I prefer to eat a smaller portion with pure egg The appetizer is extremely small: several pieces of seaweeds with tiny raw wasabi octopus The crab tempuras are huge but 80%of them are just wheat flour Then we had the crab sushi roll plate- taste is good The steamed king crab- only legs are eatable and they are delish The crab hot pot is the weirdest dish we had- they just simply boil the crab and vegetables. Soy sauce is the only flavour we could go with, so we just dip the veggies with soy sauce.  Then the waitress poured rice and eggs in the pot, it turns out to be very good actually The dessert is icecream with a thin slice of cake The bill ends up to 300$ for 5 ppl and its cash only"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place there's literally nothing to complain about except for the size of the teapot LOL (i went through three pots it was quite embarrassing to keep asking for refills)  Really though, the seats are quite spaced out so if personal space  is kind of a big deal to you then it's a good thing, as it's spaced out you can't overhear  conversations of nearby tables. Good for a peaceful dinner  The food was spectacular!! We ordered a 10lbs lobster set for 2 people. The set has snowcrabs, lobster sashimi, lobster brain steamed egg udon and fried rice also at last the lobster hotpot.   Snowcrabs and lobster sashimi was fresh, fried rice was not heavy, eggs of the udon is very very soft and THE RED BEAN ICE CREAM IS NOT BEANY AT ALL ITS ALMOST ALL MILK (WHICH I LOVE) yeah hence this review   Don't hesitate to try this place out though  P.s wouldn't know anything about the hotpot cuz we were too full and had the hotpot taken out"}
{"text":"pretty pricy...and I have to say that the lobster sashimi was really delicious, but everything else was just the same lobster crab taste in different mediums.  not being a huge fan of having that seafoody taste in everything I ate, I didn't enjoy it at all.  but I have some friends that really like it so it's probably worth checking out :p don't know where else you'd be able to have such an overload of lobster"}
{"text":"Have been here towise. Great place, price is pretty fair for what you get. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Oh my, I left this place in a lobster food coma. We came here for my dad's birthday and ordered the 10lb lobster set course for 4-6 people (I think it would be definitely too much food for 4 people though). The food tasted pretty fresh and I thoroughly enjoyed it at first but then I got a little overwhelmed since each dish featured lobster/snow crab prominently and there was a lot of repetition in flavours. Still, I would recommend this place to avid seafood lovers just for the experience. I believe they also have other set courses for 2-8 people along with some a la carte items."}
{"text":"Lunch is a great saving! Crab lunch set was a great hit with delicious steam egg and crab sushi, grilled crabs"}
{"text":"Set menu starts with 2 people. Perfect for dating since the shell are all cracked, no hard work, and also it took me 2 hours to finish the whole set menu.( not because I eat slow, that's the pace how they serve.) Delicious, just as good as the ones in Japan. The chef is the oldest son of the owner of original Japanese Kani Douraku group. Only problem is the there are way too many dishes for two to share. You get 3 crabs to share with two persons and that includes one boiled, one BBQed,and one shabushabu. The first is great, 2nd is alright and still considering good, but the latter is just boring and preferably to skip or invite the 3rd person to share. My friend and I were both stuffed once we finished the 2nd crab since there are other dishes in the set menu are served in addition to the crabs."}
