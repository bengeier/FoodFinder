{"text":"Delicious food that tastes authentic and homemade! The grilled barbecue items is a beautiful add-on to an already varied menu. Best pho in Scarborough/Markham, possibly even all of Toronto. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Was craving pho and found this place on yelp from the hot new business suggestion near my house and was not disappointed. I ordered the bun rieu, my boyfriend had the house special, and we shared the spare ribs. The bun rieu is light and doesn't leave me dehydrated like other bun rieu's I've tried due to msg. The house special broth is tasty as well. The spare ribs have an amazing flavour and an amazing garlic chilli fish sauce to go with it! Definitely will be trying other bbq menu items next time I visit! Customer service was definitely 5 stars. Super friendly people who are knowledgeable and passionate."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, the waitress was very attentive and checked up a few times to make sure that we were taken care of. Never had this type of service from any other pho places.   The food was great, because it is a newer place, the menu was not fully available yet.   Spring rolls on point. 5 stars for great service !!"}
{"text":"I decided  to try it with  my family with high expectations, after trying the pho, me and my family thought the soup was  slightly  too sweet however the noodle  bowl is bigger than some other pho place which is a plus."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with 2 of my friends, spoke to one of the owners and was told that nust opened in a month. We ordered some pho, spring rolls, rice rolls and 5 food plater with rice. All i can say that the food quality is really good. Service is good also serve hard liquor but we stayed away from it for now. I find their soup a bit gingery over all soul is really good and tasty. Has a deeper beef taste compared to all of the Vietnamese restaurants i have tried. Interior decor looks clean and has an open kitchen concept which i think they should make it more presentable. I recommend the grilled pork belly, pho, rice rolls, fried spring rolls and 5 food combo. You cant go wrong, will come back to taste some if the foods we didnt try. Price is a bit high but worth it."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best pho restaurants I've ever been to. Crazy thing is, the service is awesome! Highly recommend coming here. Pork belly skewers are really good!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended pho place. We were greeted immediately when we got in. Ordered the Pho Q house special which was great. One of our side orders fell through but the waiter apologized and we got spring rolls on the house. THE PORK BELLY IS SO GOOD, recommended*"}
{"text":"Went with my buddy pretty late into the evening and ordered some Pho and skewers. They use a charcoal grill for their skewers and man does it make a difference. Ordered some ribs and pork belly but hands down pork belly was my favorite. The fat literally melts in your mouth.  The Pho had the perfect ratio of noodles to soup and they weren't skimpy on the meat. Server was a cool dude too"}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5.0  I came here a couple days after they started their soft opening. Decor is very clean and minimalistic.   The folks working there are Vietnamese and I can tell that they are very passionate about their food and business in general.   We tried several things here after coming here twice:  Pho (3.5/5.0) - Their broth is clean with an overall sweeter taste. It comes down to preference but I prefer a more savoury broth. Not bad nonetheless and you won't come out feeling thirsty. I believe they are looking to offer a choice of fresh and dry noodle in the future as well. I find the noodles a bit on the softer side. I prefer some bounce and texture to the noodle.  Bun Rieu Cua (3.0/5.0) - I could taste the tomato and crab paste but it was quite subtle. Perhaps it may be due to the fact that it was only available for weekends and I requested it on a Monday. I do prefer the one at Bong Lua over this one as it is much more flavourful.   Skewers (4.0/5.0) - The unique thing about this place is that they also focus on BBQ. My favourite was the pork belly which was super flavourful and juicy. Texture was also perfect. The beef ribs were also good too. It comes with a chilli fish sauce dip which adds another level of tastiness.  Grilled Porkchop and Chicken Rice (3.0/5.0) - The porkchop that they used was lean so after being grilled, it became fairly dry. Perhaps this could be much improved if they chose different cuts. Chicken was better but could have also been a bit more juicy. The fried egg was done very nicely. I like the egg they have used as it is on the orangey-yellow side.  Service was great overall and the people working there are definitely a friendly bunch. Apparently they have been in the restaurant business for quite some time. This place has a lot of potential to become one of the top Vietnamese restaurants in the area once they fine tune a few things."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Food is amazing. Went two days in a row and tried many dishes. You can't go wrong with any. The bun cha ha noi was the best dish! Delicious."}
{"text":"I don't usually like Vietnamese food because I have an aversion to coriander.  This place was bomb. I had the assorted meat bowl and it was perfection. The meat was barbequed (?) I think. It was actually a pretty respectable portion.  My girlfriend had their shrimp soup and it was extremely rich and flavourful.  Love this place. After we left, all I could think about was my next fix."}
{"text":"After reading others' reviews thus far, I'm genuinely intrigued by why my experience was so overwhelmingly different.   Seeing as this new family-run pho restaurant had recently opened up in my area, I came here yesterday with 8 people to try it out. Majority of us ordered the regular house special pho (P1) while 2 of us ordered the bun rieu cua/crab vermicelli (B6) and the overall consensus across the table was \"It wasn't good.. but I guess it wasn't THAT bad. I've had worse\" - and that's not a comment I think a new restaurant should be garnering if they want to survive in such a competitive field and location.  Agreed by everyone, both the pho and vermicelli were very diluted down and not flavourful enough. I ordered B6 so speaking for myself, the broth wasn't strong enough and I could barely taste the flavour of crab. Yes, there were slices of tomato and multiple chunks of crab innards, but unfortunately, none of those flavours really seeped out into the broth. The vermicelli was also a little overcooked and too soft, breaking apart easily without much chewing.   Not to mention, the pricing here is also slightly higher than other well-established pho restaurants in the area. P1 was $9 for a medium (which is more like a small) and B6 was $12 for the same size.   I have to say, the owners were very genuine in providing attentive service and asking for constructive feedback so I wouldn't write off this restaurant just yet. However, as of yesterday, I would only give this restaurant a maximum 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Clean modern minimalistic restaurant at the corner of a plaza. Parking it tough there however... washroom was surprisingly clean maybe because its new but definitely bonus points for that! Food was really good - only had spring rolls and the pork belly skewer but my friend had the vermicelli. Based on those three items - it was good quality food prepared well. Tender flavorful skewers. Spring roll was crispy and not too heavy."}
{"text":"Tucked in the North-East corner of the plaza it isn't hard to spot Pho Q. With the many different Vietnamese cuisine options down the street it's great to see that they're trying to be different here with their charcoal grilled bbq!   I have yet to try the extend of the menu but going based on what I've had, Pho Q is probably my go-to for authentic Vietnamese food especially because it's literally down the street from my house.   Service was super friendly as the owner would come by and explain what's available (soft opening) and what his specialties are. The space is kept clean and it's also nice to see that they have a window for customers to see into the kitchen, no secrets here lol.   I've had their bun rieu and banh cuon which are both amazing, bun rieu is made a different style which I find more refreshing and lighter than the style I typically enjoy which the owner explained to me when he brought it over to me.  The banh cuon was so goood as the wrap wasn't too thick and it had a good amount of filling, came with chucks of Vietnamese ham.   I also had the bbq short ribs and pork belly which blew me away as they were charred to perfection and went perfectly with the nouc mam provided. Must try**   They also have their liquor license cause how can you eat bbq without a beer or 2?!"}
{"text":"We came for Sunday lunch here. It wasn't even half full. The lady greeted us and asked of we'd like hot or cold tea. We asked for cold, since it was so warm. She brought the tea and gave the four of us, 3 menus, she said there wasn't enough for one each. We ordered a large & medium special Pho, Grilled Pork Vermicelli, Tripe only medium Pho and 2 pork Belly Skewers. The Pho Broth is really light and bland. Not much depth in flavours and not aromatic, it's fine if you like plain food but I prefer a more robust broth. There isn't a choice of fresh or dry noodle, they just have one kind. My son ate the vermicelli and said that it was good. The pork belly skewers were very good, juicy and not burnt at all. They were the highlight of the meal. As for the superior service that everyone has mentioned, we didn't receive it. The lady was overwhelmed and it was hard to flag her down. She was pleasant when we did get to interact with her. The teapot was tiny and held 5 cups of tea, my kids were parched. We weren't offered any more liquid during our meal. So it was a good job that we were heading to Coco straight after. The young guy totally ignored us, they need more staff here as it was barely half full and hard to get service. I don't think I'd ever return for Pho, the size is small too and pricing is quite high. Seems a lot of these Yelp reviews are not genuine......"}
{"text":"New Vietnamese restaurant in the plaza! This place replaced a Chinese bbq place and the interior doesn't seem to have changed much at all. Onto the food, we ordered:  Bun Rieu Cua: This was loaded with lots of ingredients such as viet ham, fried tofu, bits of minced meat and tomatoes. I really enjoyed this, the noodles were soft but perfectly chewy. Broth wasn't very tomatoey but it had a very fresh taste.   Grilled pork vermicelli: My bf got this and he really liked it, said the pork was extremely flavorful and tender. I tried some and agree!  Pork belly skewer: Very juicy and tender, they seem to do their meats very well. However $4 for 1 skewer seems a bit much imo.  Tiramisu Coffee: I've never seen this anywhere before so we had to try it - very interested since they make the cream fresh! It's super creamy and sweet, but if you mix it with the coffee you get another flavor. Bf really enjoyed it!  Overall a very solid place that we would come back to, service was friendly and efficient and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"I am quite picky about pho and the one I had here today was certainly one of the very best if not the best! Also nice decor, cozy atmosphere and welcoming owner."}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant! I went here today with my parents for dinner and we all enjoyed the food very much. The BBQ marinades were on point. The pork belly was flavourful, crispy and juicy (and probably was my favourite thing).   Ordered: 3 Vermicelli bowls, 1 BBQ beef rib and 1 pork belly  As a guest, I could really tell that the owner spent quite a bit of time to get the details right from the clever name to the \"living wall\", to the window into the kitchen and uncluttered menu. We actually had the pleasure of meeting the owner who was very attentive and friendly. I like where he is going with the business and hope he succeeds!!!   If you ask my recommendation, I would say give this place a go!  Afterwards you're definitely going to say... True Dat. ;P  #forcedpun (Does anyone get this? I dunno)"}
{"text":"Great service all around. Food was great. Atmosphere was pleasant.   Place: 5/5  Nice and modern setting with good music and very clean interior  Service: 4.99/5   LOL. The waitress was great and checked up on us throughout the night. Docked 0.01 cause I asked for no cilantro in my pho but I was greeted with cilantro anyways. She had a 14 hour day and a lot on her plate. Not a deal breaker but would prefer without it. Just like the other yelpers, never received this type of service at a pho restaurant  Food: 4.75/5   The food is great. The pho was pretty damn good. Broth was incredibly light and you can taste the beef broth.   Pork belly skewer was awesome!   The food is 5/5 just wished the portion was bigger. For the large pho, i felt there wasn't enough noodles to broth ratio. Probably cause I like to eat, maybe include an XL or just add more noodles  I had a great first time there and I couldn't have been more pleased. Will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Honestly you can go anywhere for pho and have your cravings satisfied but it's totally different here.  I actually crave for Pho Q!!  A lot of my friends have been talking about this place and I decided to make the drive and check it out myself. You will not regret it.   The interior of the restaurant is very nice, modern and clean. The owner was very sweet and informative and also gave us his recommendations on dishes and we went for everything he said!   He has a window that looks into the kitchen where you can see your skewers being grilled, I got the Pork Belly skewer and I can say it was one of the best skewers I've ever had. My friends enjoyed it too because you can take the charred flavour from the grill! We also got the Bun Thit Nuong, Com 5 Mau and Pho Q Dat (LOL). All of the dishes were really good and authentic which is really hard to find in Pho stores lately.   Everything on the menu was delicious and I cannot wait to come back again. Definitely recommend Pho Q to everyone!"}
{"text":"Came to try this Pho restaurant mainly due to all the hype and reviews on this place.    Ordered: 1. Fried Spring Rolls (5 out of 5) 2. Grilled Chicken Vermecelli (3 out of 5) 3. Pho (4 out of 5)  I would definately come back here but I won't order the vermecelli and will strictly stick to there pho.  I found that the vermecelli was a bit overcooked and it didn't have much taste however the grilled chicken was really good.  The service was excellent and everyone was extremely friendly.  I think this will be my new pho joint!"}
{"text":"Saw the cute name of this place floating on the Interwebs so I figured it must be cool. Also, my friend tried this place and the pics were delectable.   I would've given this place a 3* if it wasn't the impeccable customer service. It was better than going to a high-end Italian place.   Interior was clean and that fake plant wall was pretty cute. Washrooms were also clean. This is super important.   The server dude (who I assume owns the place) was super nice. We got dirty chopsticks (literally dried rice still on the tips) and we're like \"Uh.\" and he apologized then got us a new set. I like that they place the utensils and napkins on a square plate and served them as such. It's so much better than just slapping them on the table or fishing for clean cutlery from a metal box.   Anyway, so another reason I would've given 3* is because they didn't have all their menu items ready. Granted, the nice guy warned us ahead of time and said we can decide on dishes and he'll let us know if they're available.  Lamb and mussels were not available. I had REALLY wanted lamb. :(((   Dude got the beef noodle thing (the signature one), and it smelled and looked nice. I got Pho Ga because I'm allergic to beef, but I gotta say that their chicken broth was super nice. It wasn't salty to the max and it was refreshing to drink. I asked for 0 cilantro.   There was way too little chicken in it, but I guess I understand. So yeah, honestly, if there were lamb, it'd be a solid 4*, possibly 5* if all menu items were available. Again, that service was so good, I had to pick up my jaw from the ground.  They've just opened for ~3 weeks. I'll come back possibly later when they secure all menu items.  Please make sure your utensils are washed thoroughly! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"A newly opened pho place located in the Midland and Finch plaza so we decided to come and check it out. It wasn't too busy when we arrived and this pho place is smaller then you typical pho restaurant. A lot of reviews so far have pointed at this place being very good. I ordered the P1- The House Special Pho which has a bit of everything in it which is usually the kind of pho dish that I order. They offer 2 sizes of S and L. The price point for both is a little bit on the higher side at $9 and $11 respectively. The large bowl had a good amount of meat, noodles and broth which was great. I also wanted to give the skewers a try so the owner recommend getting the short ribs I was definitely full after this meal. Ribs were nicely seasoned and cooked and you get 3 pieces for $5 so not bad.   My friend and I both loved the broth from the pho that we both wanted to finish all of it. Quite good and it didn't taste like it had much MSG in it which was great! Thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. Some constructive feedback for the restaurant is that the menu is quite small but has all. Would be nice to have more visual pictures in the menu as I've been to many pho places and look to see the visuals."}
{"text":"Came to Pho'Q with my dad for lunch and it was a really pleasant experience!   Food: I had the rare beef & ball pho. The broth was super tasty & light, it wasn't overly salty like a lot of pho restaurants. The beef.. was AMAZING, it was super soft and juicy. They use beef tendon balls too! I want to also mention that they offer culantro (saw tooth herb) as an optional topping- comes in the same plate as the bean sprouts, basil and chilli. Restaurants don't ever offer that so make use of it!   Service: There was one waiter only and traffic was picking up. Kudos to him for still being attentive while taking and expediting everyone's order!   I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Staff was very friendly. We mentioned we found them on yelp and got 10% off"}
{"text":"Let's just say this place did not disappoint. When I saw the 4.5 star rating (which is very rare for a Vietnamese restaurant), I was surprised and felt like I had to try it for myself.  First impression when I walked in was this is not the typical run down, in and out kind of viet place. The furnishings were more modern, the place itself was very clean and the vibes were more sociable. The staff actually spoke proper English too!! Bonus!!   Menu looks small but is extensive enough to keep you coming back for more. Menu comes in English, Vietnamese and Chinese. Bonus again!   My fiancé and I ordered the spring rolls, house pho, grilled pork belly, house rice dish and durian milkshake.  We love the spring rolls from jasmine garden but these were pretty good too! Freshly fried, the spring rolled was quite oily but the stuffings were fresh and moist.   My fiancé had the medium house pho ($9) and he thought it was well flavored and meat portions were generous compared to other places. I, however didn't like a particular flavor in the broth and find the soup wasn't hot enough. I'm the type that would rather burn my tongue than have cold soup though..   The grilled pork belly was super tasty, freshly grilled and had even amounts of fat and meat. The price on the menu is per skewer so two grilled pork belly skewers were $8.  My absolute fave dish of the night was the house special rice dish that came with grilled pork chop, grilled chicken, fish cake, steam egg, sunny side up egg and a huge portion of rice. The portions were generous, seasoning was perfect, everything was so fresh! This was all for only $14! I had to share half the dish with my fiancé. I've had rice dishes from a few other viet places but none had the same amount of portion or freshness.   The durian milkshake ($4) was made with real durian and they had added condensed milk so it tasted super sweet and refreshing.   The staff was very friendly and caters to your request. A table behind me had requested to mix two flavors of fruit for one milkshake and they had agreed.   I will definitely be back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Without question, if the name doesn't get you the food certainly will.  This is an up n' coming new place. The owner Dat, is young and certainly understands both humor and great Vietnamese cuisine. This is a family run business and the dishes are nothing short of outstanding!  Dat's sister and cousin also work there. The atmosphere and decor is very clean, new and modern - a far cry from places which have been around far too long without a facelift or a new coat of paint.  But enough about the decor, let's talk food!  Bonnie and I arrived with a healthy appetite and Nicole (sister) made some wonderful recommendation. She suggested we try their broth because as anyone who likes pho (pronounced \"fa\"), can attest that the broth either makes or kills this dish. Their broth is layered with many, many subtleties and very well reduced. This means that it neither looks, nor tastes, watered down like so many other places.  As far as dishes, we shared the meat combo, the cuts of chicken, pork belly and short ribs are so flavorful and thankfully the portions are normal (read: not American). As we are trying to lay off the carbs, we had a compliment of veggie dishes including the bell peppers; king oyster mushrooms and grilled eggplant. YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY DAT's sauces. They are again, ranging from delightful burn to a silky smooth peanut satay of his own design.  We had been looking for a new place to replace our old one, since we moved to North York. This place is now our \"IT Place.  You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Among a sea of unremarkable Vietnamese styled restaurants, this place really stands out as a welcome addition to the area. The food is delicious and finishes cleanly, note the lower sodium content and absence of added MSG. For the health conscious who also want a tasty experience you better come here and not a Vietnamese themed restaurant."}
{"text":"I yelped this place and found that the reviews were pretty good. Sis was visiting us from overseas so I decided to take mom and sis to this place for dinner. My sister was very satisfied with the food and I thought the prices seemed reasonable too. However I think the owner/waitress tried too hard to be \"friendly\". She asked my sister if I was her aunt and was very surprised that my mom was my mom because she thought mom and I were sisters. Mom is 23 years older than me and I am 7 years older than my sis. Therefore, these numbers would have to be swapped in order for the owner's/waitress's observations to make sense. I would suggest that the owner/waitress stick to the usual topics, if they really wanted to strike up a conversation with their customers e.g. \"Is this your first visit at our restaurant?\" Because age-guessing game is never fun, especially to the (unwilling) participants who seem to have been offended."}
{"text":"Amazing Pho! So so so happy I found this place!! Hard to find a place where food and service are both top notch! The owners are super friendly and they know their stuff. We always get the pho tai and it never disappoints. It comes out piping hot and the dish has so many flavours! Never salty and no MSG! The owner also made his own take of this spicy sauce that just elevates the flavour of the broth even more. Spring rolls were freshly made and the pork belly and short ribs were perfectly cooked and tasty. Hard to explain how good it is in words. Service is quick and service is attentive without being overbearing as it is with most other restaurants. Nice, clean and new facility with open concept kitchen. I would highly recommend this place to everyone! I have eaten here twice in one week already and the week isn't over yet. I have no shame so Ill probably come back again"}
{"text":"These guys are so chill, and this place is really cute.   I ordered a medium rare beef pho ($9)-- surprisingly big for a medium bowl!   I liked the food a lot. The broth was very light, but you can taste the complexity of it and all of the spices that have been simmering in it for hours. The veggies were pretty fresh, and the noodles had a nice texture and consistency.  It was interesting that they garnished with jullienned strips of ginger. Don't think I have seen that in Pho before!  I wanted to get the Bun Rieu Cua, but I went on a weekday. Have to come back on a weekend for that!"}
{"text":"We decided to try pho'q over our usual pho place after seeing such high reviews. First impression, a small and cozy little restaurant located at the corner of the plaza. The staff is very friendly and will check up on you to make sure everything is okay.   Ordered a bowl of pho and the initial sip had a spicy tang to it. A couple of noodles laters I found tiny strands of ginger. Not a really big fan of ginger so the pho was not my fave at this place. However their vermicelli noodle bowls were quiet good. And their fresh q shrimp rice rolls were good as well."}
{"text":"Food here is great. Ordered the house special and deep fried spring rolls. You HAVE to try the spring rolls! The staff here are very nice and attentive. During my stay here, they probably came to our table 2-3 times asking how the food was and if we needed anything, it's a great feeling!   Wanted to try their lamb skewers but the server said it was all sold out, guess I'll have to try them next time.   If you are looking to try new pho and a clean place to eat at, give Pho Q a try! Would definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"I came here with friends on a Friday night at 10:30 pm for the good review and I found my experience here was quite disappointed.   My biggest complaint about this restaurant is that the service is too slow. Pho is something that shouldn't take long time to cook. But me and my friends waited 15 mins for someone to offer us a table, 20 mins for the menu, 30 mins for the food to come.   And when the food came, it's not even what I ordered. And they had to send back to the kitchen, another 10 mins wait.   Food is average. Service is not bad, except the long wai time. Decoration of this place was decent and have young people's atmosphere."}
{"text":"June 8, 2018 - When we arrived we just wanted to look at the menu. I just kept thinking do I want Pho or not.. But as we walked towards the cashier, we looked at some of the food that the other customers were eating and it looked very good.   We ordered the Shrimp spring roll,  Pho'Q Dat House special, B2 Pork vermicelli w/ spring roll and B3 Chicken vermicelli w/ spring roll  The two ppl that was serving us were very polite, funny and down to earth. We waited about 15mins for the order which is okay for a restaurant. The servers checked up on us every once in a while making jokes. They are very nice ppl.   Pho'Q Dat House special 8/10 B2 Pork vermicelli w/ spring roll 9.5/10 B3 Chicken vermicelli w/ spring roll 10/10 Shrimp spring roll was 6 Service was 10/10  The portions were very good, and we really liked the B2 & B3 dishes. I didn't try the Pho'Q House special (maybe next time) ....  But..they have a weekend only menu of a few things that I want to try. So I will be back soon"}
{"text":"This place was excellent in all regards.  We were in the area for work and my colleagues and I had the best meal of our trip here.  Inside the decor was very nice, much nice than most other restaurants in the area that we experienced.  The owner, Dat, was very attentive from the moment we walked in.  You can tell he takes great pride in his restaurant on all levels from the decor, the restrooms, the music, and of course the food!!  The food was phenomenal.  They have high quality ingredients and the presentation, taste, textures, combinations were all fantastic.  Everyone loved their meal.   This is a family operation and if they keep up this level of quality and craftsmanship they will be very successful.  Thank you Dat and the Pho Q team!!  Keep it up!  Wish this place was in my town..."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in the GTA, and I would say this is by far my favourite. Not only did the food taste excellent, the presentation was top notch and the ingredients were very fresh.  The service was on point; very fast and polite, and they show that they care for their customers. To top it off, the decor is modern, the utensils are proper, and the place is clean. All for a very fair price.   I would definitely be coming here often. Definitely recommend trying their spring rolls and bun (vermicelli)."}
{"text":"4/5 (0.5 off for service and 0.5 for the menu)  In an area where restaurants are almost unlimited... including 2 other viet restaurants, I decided to check this place out after seeing some good reviews online.  I wasn't disappointed. Walked in at 8pm on a Sunday night and the restaurant was pretty busy. There were two waiters serving the whole restaurant. The restaurant is decorated nicely and seats are comfortable. They can accommodate bigger groups since their tables and chairs are mobile but they do have some booths. They have a large screen TV with CP24 playing.   The food, is legit. The bbq section is nice - we ordered short ribs and pork belly and both were delicious! However, my hubby doesn't do spicy and he found the pork belly a bit spicy for him. Their menu doesn't highlight which ones are spicy just says it's in special marinade, so I think the menu does need some tweaking.  The pho was great. Broth was light not too salty and there was good amount of toppings on it. The medium bowl was enough for us... but they also have a large size for those who have bigger appetites. The bun vermicelli was also pretty good we had the pork and spring rolls and the rolls were crispy, pork was well seasoned but again a bit spicy (we saw red pepper flakes)... which would be helpful to know for people who don't eat spicy.  The service needs a bit of work. Only 2 waiters meant we didn't get anything to drink until our food arrived. And we actually had to flag someone down and ask for it at that point. They did apologize though so I do understand the difficulty when serving 30-40 ppl beteeen two waiters.  Price is a bit higher than average but for the quality I think it's fair.  I'll def be back again :)"}
{"text":"Probably my new favourite place for Vietnamese food! We arrived here for an early lunch on a Sunday; they opened a bit late but were very hospitable once we entered. Service is friendly, attentive, and pleasantly mellow. The place itself is nice too -- clean and well-decorated.  The food came out pretty quickly and was delicious! I ordered a pork belly skewer and also shared a Chicken Vermicelli Noodle dish with my friend. The meats are cooked perfectly and are incredibly flavourful, especially the umami-packed skewer! Portions are huge, so the noodles were ample food for both of us, especially since we were planning on dessert after. :) Our waiter also brought us some spicy fish sauce to accompany our food, which really added to the dish.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner wanting to try a new pho place with my parents. Arrived and were seated right away but saw that it picked up immediately.  We ordered a large house pho, fresh rolls, and the meat platter. We asked to hold onto the menu as we weren't sure how big the portion sizes were, but given a hesitant look as the waiter explained they didn't have enough menus and that if we wanted anything else we could get the menu back later.  Food came a little slower than other pho places we've been to. And the time it took between getting our appetizer and mains was a little longer than preferred.  Fresh rolls 4/5 Hard to go wrong with fresh rolls to be honest.. but expected a few more pieces or larger pieces with a $7 price tag.  House Pho 3.5/5 Nice clean broth. Mom really enjoyed the noodles, said they had a nice texture to them. Could have had a little more meat in it though. Ended up ordering another one of these because it's a little smaller than your average pho place.  Bbq meat plate 3.5/5 Pork belly skewers were fantastic! Would have been happy if the whole platter was just that. Flavor on the chicken was good, but a little dry. Same with the beef short ribs.  Overall the food was good but service needed some work. They have good intentions of being friendly, but I think they still have some work to do. After we ordered, a waiter came and asked if we liked spicy. Literally words were \"do you like spicy\" with no other context. Then, when our pho came, my family is used to family style, so we asked for 3 bowls to share. It took 5 minutes to get 3 bowls, so we just sat there staring at our noodles. Waters were also never refilled. Has potential though as time goes on.  Good place to come with friends if everyone is paying for their own meals, but as a family I would go to another pho place as prices are higher (even with the 10% discount) here and it doesn't seem like the dishes are really family-style friendly."}
{"text":"The beef ribs vermicelli was well done! Lots of ribs and tastes just right.Noodle portion could be a bit more though. For the price the quality is good but the portion a bit smaller than other viet restaurants..."}
{"text":"Good soup base without MSG but the large isn't big enough for a hungry guy. Awesome bbq meat and fish sauce."}
{"text":"Good customer service and friendly staff !   It's a clean restaurant with great options! Must try and go back to try more!"}
{"text":"It's always tough to give a low rating when the operators of the restaurant clearly care and want to improve. The girl who served us was constantly checking up on our table and asking for feedback. I felt she was very genuine so I want to be honest and direct in this review.  My parents and I ordered a large house special pho, a grilled meat combo, fried spring rolls, Q faves five rice, grilled oysters, and Vietnamese iced coffee.  The grilled meat combo was a combination of 3 pcs beef ribs, some grilled chicken, and 2 skewers of pork belly. Our server said they were out of lamb (?) but she did not say if it would be replaced with anything. The beef ribs and chicken were average, but the pork belly was very good. It would be nice if the combo came out at the same time on 1 platter instead of separately.  Grilled oysters were a ripoff at $7 per pc simply due to size. Each oyster was smaller than a chicken nugget. Typically, grilled oysters are made using larger types. The flavour was good and apparently served with a family secret sauce. Either price needs to be decrease or size increased.  Spring rolls were average fare. No real comment.  As I've read in other reviews, I agree that the pho broth was on the lighter side. To the point of the owner's reply to a review, it may just be something the customer is not used to. But put it this way, it did not make me want to eat more the way richer broths do. No customer is going to return to a restaurant to get used to the food.  The iced coffee was not good. It was served with the condensed milk and ice already in the cup, causing the condensed milk to harden and not melt from the dripping hot coffee. This also results in the ice melting and diluting the coffee. Thought this was a simple thing to mess up.  I would say the Q fave five rice was my favorite of the whole meal. You get 5 different items with rice so it's a taste of everything.  To me, the experience of great service and average food is always better than average (or poor) service and great food. That's why it's hard to give this place 3 stars.  I wish Pho'Q success as the owners truly care about their craft."}
{"text":"Tried this place out and was pleasantly surprised to find a bomb viet restaurant uptown :)  Everything we had was good so can't go wrong with whatever you order and the staff was very friendly the place is very neat and tidy"}
{"text":"This is a new family-owned hot spot within the GTA!  The pho tastes very comforting and pleasant. It makes you walk out of here smiling and wanting to come back here again! I for one, will be back here for sure!  The staffs are very friendly, the food tastes great, and the prices are just right for the quality that they give out.  Come here for the experience you deserve! :)"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. There was only one sever and one cook on a busy Saturday. We had to wait a long time to order with the server not knowing the menu that well. After 40 minutes and multiple people leaving before us, we had to leave as well. We enquired about our order and were told that we had to order again. All of this with three kids waiting for their food.  Meanwhile they were taking takeout orders while having this long backlog."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem in Scarborough through YELP (honestly very thankful!!!) This is the first Vietnamese restaurant that I went to that serves charcoal grilled meat! Came here around 10PM on Victoria Day and we were greeted by two nice, lovely severs. Pho Q's space looks very clean and spacious. My boyfriend and I decided to share a dish of their house special pho and a rice noodle dish that had a lot of pork. I love how spicy their fish sauce is - we love spice and they definitely won our hearts. At first glance, you would think that the Vietnamese rice noodle dish doesn't have enough noodles, but booooy we were wrong! The amount of meat they serve compensates for it!   Food and venue is great. Customer service makes you feel like they know you so they'll definitely take care of you as one of their friends that they care about - only thing I can give feedback on is how they serve/refill their drinks. Probably just top off water/tea since guests will be parched after eating bomb diggity food!"}
{"text":"We had to try the brand new Viet place that opened up. The interior was pleasant and the waitress who served us was extremely friendly and knew the cuisine well. We ordered pho and bun rieu cua. Both reminded me of my family's home cooking in terms of ingredients and flavour. My whole family is from Vietnam so I grew up eating a lot of Viet food. Broths were clean and flavourful. I recommend giving this place a try before they get busy."}
{"text":"Gave this restaurant a try since it has high ratings for a pho restaurant which is rare. Ordered the grill beef ribs and pork belly, both were really good. Love that they gave us our own individual sauce for the grill meat. The pork belly wasnt as fatty as i thought which is good, half meat and half fat. Also ordered the house special pho, compare to other restaurant the soup base is not as flavourful, but it is flavourful in its own way. I did not need to add any hoisin and sriracha sauce to it which i normally do. The basil leaves and extra ingredients that came with the pho noodle were all very fresh. I wasnt thirsty after eating the pho noodle which is rare, since most pho places have a lot of msg. The beef in the pho were all very good cut of meat, sometimes they mix in some tough meat in the soup and i didnt get any at all at this place. The service was very good too, the owner was very attentive. Will definitely come back to this restaurant."}
