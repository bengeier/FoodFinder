{"text":"In my last review I was not thrilled with the service. I guess someone noticed. We've been back several times in the last couple of months and now the service is very good. We have also tried several more of their food creations and they are all delicious and nicely presented. They have a special summer menu offering some terrific salads and beverages. Also, their filtered coffee is some of the best in the city, served with a small biscuit drizzled with chocolate on the side!"}
{"text":"I ordered a crepe and my friend a waffle, the portions were very small (few pieces of fruits, added up together probably not a full strawberry). The dessert was good but average. We also had to wait a long time for the food and the bill. If I had to pick a dessert place I wouldn't insist on this one."}
{"text":"So so so so soooooooo good 
We ordered the chocolate soufflé and of course the chocolate ball! I was dying from a chocolate coma by the time we left but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. Come hungry (as in, don't eat dinner before dessert!!) Two of us split the brownie/gelato crepe and couldn't finish it! The hot chocolate is also amazing. If you love chocolate or sweets, start fasting and get there immediately!"}
{"text":"I was in Mtl for 3 nights. Had the souffle the first night and the c'wow the second night. Tried to go back the 3rd night but was too late. Definitely worth going to Mtl for. The deserts were deeelicious. still licking my lips thinking of the deserts. Regret not being able to have tried everthing on their menu. 
I've seen variations of the C'wow on the internet, pouring the sauce to melt the crust, so this was an experience that did not disappoint. The hot caramel sauce with the melted chocolate dome crust and the brownie inside made it gooey sweet, but the gelato and fruits inside helped to temper the sweetness of the chocolate. It was like a fondu.
C'ChoColat was conveniently located in downtown MTL, on Bishop street and open till 11 or 12 at night. I definitely recommend this place for dessert."}
{"text":"Really happy I found this place. Their drinks and dishes are so delicious. The presentation is beautiful. Service is quick and friendly. Would definitely recommend it to chocolate lovers!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to hang out with friends! I would give it a 5 star but it's just a little pricey. But THE FOOD WAS BOMB! The service was good too! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my other friends!"}
{"text":"Fabulous crepes and chocolate. Delicious coffee. So friendly and accommodating to us, traveling with 2 small children. Our server, Maya was so so kind and sweet. Even gave us recommendations on what to do locally with the kids! Can't wait to go back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Service was great but desserts not so much. Beautiful presentation but did not taste as good as it looked. Don't even think the dessert pizza dough was fresh."}
{"text":"It is all about the finished product.... I couldn't decide what to order as I was not familiar with the offerings.  Once I settled one the Peanut Butter S'mores it was one of the most delicious unique dessert experiences you could ask for.  The chef is incredibly professional and pumps out amazing chocolate delights that taste as good as they look.  I wish there was such a place in the U.S.  I will return next time I come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! The dome was as good as promised. Especially the caramel sauce which was very buttery. It's so easy to get used to mediocre caramel. This was excellent!"}
{"text":"I don't usually love crepes, but I really liked the classic c'chocolate wiith the matcha matcha pot masson, it was really good!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had the Blackberry smoothie, Italian crepe and Nutella pizza. Everything was absolutely adorable. The waitress really.made the night. Her name is Maia. If you get her you're in luck. She was super friendly, on top of everything and just plain good at what she does. She offered us garlic sauce for our fries, sampled macaroons and even loved how polite we are apperently. Would definitely recommend this place. If you like sweet or even savory dessert style mains hit this place up."}
{"text":"Very delicious chocolate options and very fancy service. I would love to give it 5 stars but the service went very slowly so I gave 4 stars for that. I recommend it as a unique chocolate and sweet store; thumb up (y) :)"}
{"text":"Quality of desserts were very good.  Reasoning for not giving higher rating was for price and service.  In my opinion very overpriced. Milk shake was 13.50 and was in a small Mason jar.  Service was slow and while wait staff was pleasant, just felt we had extremely long wait time for every thing. Location good and may be why so over priced."}
{"text":"Amazing desserts and a good variety of them to choose from. Also they make all the desserts look absolutely incredible when they serve it to you. Although you may feel like wanting a bit more for the price, it's definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"À essayer!
C'est une petite place, un peu déserte mais accueillante. L'endroit est propre et le service est excellent. De plus, il est près du métro guy concordia.
Si je me souviens bien, il n'y avait qu'une employee lorsqu'on est arrivée mais on ne remarquait pas l'absence des autres employés. Il y avait 1-2 autres tables occupé mais la serveuse était présente si on avait besoin quelques choses.
Il y a de la variété dans le menu, crêpes sucrés, salés, des gaufres,etc. J'ai non seulement adoré le service mais aussi leur crêpe! J'ai choisi une crêpe \"Blanche neige\" et pour une fois je pouvais goûter a la crêpe. Je suis assez plusieurs fois a d'autres endroits qui font des crêpes , mais ils les font  vraiment trop mince et ça ne goûtent que les fruits.

Les prix sont corrects selon le format de l'assiette."}
{"text":"Sweet tooth craving? This place is amazing! Their deserts are truly works of art! Off the Main Street so it wasn't too crowded. We had the milkshakes and they were masterpieces. Tasted better than they looked! Couldn't recommend this place more!"}
{"text":"I had a cappuccino which was very tasty. The waffle on the other hand was not tasty at all. Maybe too much sugar? The chocolate that came with the waffle (dark chocolate) was tasty though. Overall, too pricey for what it is. The experience feels incomplete somehow"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! It's overpriced but definitely worth a try. Gorgeous, diabetes inducing, mouthwatering options. I had the Ferrero Rocher milkshake and Nutella crepe. Loved both. My bf had the bubble waffles - they were delicious!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were in town for the Fantasia Film Festival and had some time to kill. We're walking around, the place looks good... sure, we'll try it out. We got two of their alcoholic dessert shakes (the blackberry mojito and the Moulin Rouge) to split. I felt like I'd died and gone to heaven. The shakes looked amazing, but more important than that they TASTED amazing, which is the whole point. And not expensive given what you're getting. Service was attentive and not too overbearing. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! 
I heard a lot about the C'WOW and wanted to see it with my own eyes.
Super kind waitress, I made her repeat 3 times the ice cream options (oops haha)
We ordered the C'WOW, soufflé, hot chocolate and Tea. 
The C'WOW is incredible to watch haha. When chocolate melt chocolate to reveal more chocolate, exciting moment right there. There were fruits, waffle, ice cream (pistachio I chose :D) and caramel. 
The soufflé is really small and it came with ice cream, a crazy caramel food art and some \"dipping\" chocolate (2 options to choose from).
The hot chocolate was fancy. It comes with a shot of chocolate. It's like the idea of a sake bomb. You put the shot in the middle and pour hot chocolate in.
Thumbs up for their Food art and creativity! Fun experience!
Omg the jasmine pearl dragon tea helped a lot. I am a tea person and without the tea I don't think I can handle that much chocolate haha.

Overall amazing experience. Unique. Food art. Creative. Exciting. 
I would definitely come back for more tea and try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"It is really hard to find the words to describe my experience of visiting this place. Let me start with the lounge's ambiance: its interior, which includes the decor, is very modern and cozy. The orange themed lounge with it's comfortable and attractive booth seats and chairs allows you to enjoy the dining experience with your five senses! (add to this the lovely smell of chocolate, good music, and in the coming paragraph, I will discuss the taste in details ;) ) It also offers multiple plugs for those who use their laptops to study or work.

Let's go to the GOOD STUFF: THE FOOD! You cannot go wrong ordering almost anything from their delicious menu. Although this place serves popular desserts such as crepes, waffles, and chocolate pizzas, the taste that these items offer is beyond ordinary. Each item comes with a unique twist in the taste and the presentation. Furthermore, the menu reflects \"delicious\" creativity! I mean, they have nutella sushi, chocolate dome, and mouth-watering fondues! Their hot and cold beverages are also a must-try (I LOVE the C'Nuts hot chocolate with 70% of chocolate topped with marshmallows and diced almonds  ).
The taste of their chocolate is heavenly and it will surely be the most memorable and euphoric experience for your taste buds! If you prefer savory dishes, the menu has some excellent variety of choices and my personal favourite is the C'Shish Taouk. 

I can proudly say that I'm a loyal customer to this place and what keeps me returning is the consistency of food quality and excellent service. 

In sum, C'Chocolate truly redefines the chocolate eating experience and I encourage everyone reading this review to try it out ;)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and can foresee more visits in the near future. I always get the C'Wow, it has a little bit of everything. It has a perfect balance of sweetness and flavour. Definitely worth the visit, atmosphere, and price too!"}
{"text":"The C'Wow really deserves the WOW in its name!! 

My friend and I shared the C'Wow and trust me, it is more than enough to fill two people up. It is a little pricey at $17, so it is perfect to share. I was worried that maybe the taste wouldn't be great, as the Instagram famous foods are usually underwhelming but this was an exception. We opted for a scoop of hazelnut ice cream (you have a choice between quite a few flavours) and it was DELICIOUS! The waffle, brownie, crunchy caramel crumble, chocolate sauce and berries are a delicious combination that is very satisfying. The service was wonderful, our server was very efficient and friendly. Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Everything looks so tasty here but I think they should make things a little less sweet. I tried a matcha drink and toasted pecan banana crepe with caramel. They both looked awesome and tasted okay except for the fact thatt they were too sweet for me to tell apart taste of caramel from the matcha, hahaa!"}
{"text":"It may have been just an off night, but the smell of this place was extremely off-putting. We walked in and immediately we were hit with this dank, bitter smell. Definitely not the smell of chocolate. We sat down and the smell didn't improve. 

Other than that, our waitress was extremely nice. The c'Wow was pretty good. At first, it looked better than it tasted, but after a while it really grew on us.

Overall, not sure where I stand on this place."}
{"text":"The food is very average, nothing special at all, service was really slow, to expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick dessert. Ordered the Peanut Better shake. The presentation was good but it didn't have the consistency of a shake (I.e. watered down) and could not taste any peanut butter except for the peanut butter cup garnishment."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience there at the first time?I am crazy about the waffle only in the place, so I tried different kinds of waffle?Those are incrediable?The chocolate bôme looks good, but I was a bit disappointed, cos taste is just so so?Those desserts are creativity and good-looking. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"is there such a thing of too much of a good thing? Maybe not.

As I said I would I took Mom for brunch here is a.m. she opted for the Classic waffle & I for the Package crepe. We both totally loved our treats (as expected); we'll be back. Yum! Maybe for something savoury to change it up."}
{"text":"Nice stop for a quick bite while walking around Catherine St area. Nothing fancy, but outrageously good mason jars"}
{"text":"Had the crepe and chocolate soufflé here!  Both delish - The chocolate soufflé especially was outstanding!!  Very fluffy and went well with the ice cream!  Our server was very helpful and the restaurant overall was pleasant and nice to lounge around after dinner.  This place is known for the C'Wow, which is the chocolate dome over ice cream and a waffle, and they serve it by pouring hot caramel over the dome so it melts and collapses, exposing the ice cream waffle underneath.  I'm not a fan of caramel so I didn't order it, but it was very entertaining to watch them serve this signature dish to the table next to us!

Would def come back and recommend others to come!"}
{"text":"The desserts at this place are beautiful too look at, and just as beautiful to eat. We stopped by this place after dinner, and even though I was full I was determined to finish my amazing crepe.

The servers were friendly, but there were only two servers for about 45-50 people probably, if not more. So service was a little slow. That is my only complaint.

I can't wait to stop by again next time we are in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something other then the usual dessert spots, we spotted c chocolate and have it ago. When we first walked in we noticed how big clean and spacious. I'm not a big chocolate person but the menu really had my mouth watering. We decided to get milkshakes to start we had the Oreo cheesecake and my match match man. They were a decent size and very tasty and are pretty to look at ! Next we had the icy hot pot which is a deconstructed s'mores with a scoop of your favourite flavoured ice cream which was good however the crumble in this dish could have been a little sweeter. The tiramisu I had was light and tasty and offered a real authentic taste. And some how we had room to still split a rocky road waffle which blew me away it was not to sweet but still really delicious would recommend this one for sure !"}
{"text":"I tried the ferrerro chocolate milkshake in the mason jar and it was very good, my bf had the white chocolate berries milkshake and it was good also. But I really do think it's overpriced. 13.50$ cad plus tax for a milkshake is a lil bit too much. The staff is very polite and helpful though."}
{"text":"I loved C'chocolat !!! Everything is so fresh and the chocolate is amazing. It is the best out of all \" chocolate\" places such as Juliette et Chocolat etc."}
{"text":"DESSERT. Definitely the best milkshake I've ever had! I got the Matcha Matcha Man and I loved how it was the perfect level of sweet. My boyfriend got the Nutella Banana Split, which was also quite good but requires a huge sweet tooth. 

CAFÉ. The cafe ambiance is decent - great for friends or a casual date. They do seat quite a few people, but definitely get super busy during night time. 

SERVICE. The reason I'd give this place a 4/5 is because of the slow service. It took about 30 minutes for our order to arrive, since they were super busy near closing time.  

PRICE. The milkshakes are on the pricier side (~$15) for the quantity. 

Despite the service and price, I still think about the milkshake and would love to return when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The creativity and presentation of the dishes here is top notch, however the quality of the food does not live up to the show. 

We had a red velvet milkshake and the C'wow (melting chocolate dome). The quality of the chocolate didn't strike me as being very high and both items were so sweet and sugary that you really could not appreciate the taste of the various components. The sugar just over powered all the other flavours so there was no complexity or finesse to the taste. 

My search continues for a drop dead amazing dessert spot."}
{"text":"Amazing treats. Tasty and very appealing. Busy at night. Great place to hang out grab a sweet, a drink, or some coffee. Service was much slower than I enjoyed but other than that I'd come back."}
{"text":"#@$!#!$@ 

That is all. :)

No, jokes. But, holy moly is this place DELICIOUS. Came here last weekend after a friend said he had heard good things, and I'm still dreaming about the amazing 'fettucine' I ordered.

The place itself is super cute and cozy, and was bustling with people. We waited about 5 minutes for a table for 3, and during our wait, we were offered small samples of hot chocolate which were delicious. Once we were seated, we spent some time going through the very extensive menu and had a really hard time deciding. I ordered the C'Royal drink (super strong) and hubby had the C'Caramel (equally strong) both of which were delicious. The drinks were served on a small platter each with a side of chocolate drizzled fruit which we thought was a nice touch. When it came to order our plates, the three of us settled on the C'Wow (chocolate dome dessert), the Creppucine (with hazelnut ice cream and Nutella), and a waffle/cheesecake combo. 

First of all, service is super fast. Second of all, the plates are HUGE. Third of all, I haven't had a dessert this good in forever and a day (the Creppucine is to die for). Super flavorful crepes sliced thinly and piled on the plate like fettucine, mixed in with pieces of deliciously perfect brownies, drizzled with nutella, and topped with white chocolate shavings with a generous scoop of hazelnut icecream smack dab in the middle of this beautiful plate....The flavors...oh..the flavors were outstanding. I literally went crossed eyed from pure joy when I took the first bite and was so sad when it was over. Huge calorie bomb for sure but this was worth every single bite.

The C'Wow did not excite me as much and I found it to be overly sweet but if you're a fan of chocolate and caramel, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. I can't write anymore because I'm now very distracted with my memories of my amazing dessert....Sorry Yelp!

A+ for amazing service, a great concept, and phenomenal desserts. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious. I got the pistache pizazz bubble waffle I believe it was called. Bubble waffle filled with pistachio ice cream, topped with pistachios and cranberries, drizzled with white chocolate and surrounded by ghazal et banat -  a middle eastern cotton candy. It was huge and I forced myself to eat every last bite because of how amazing it was. I took off a star because of lackluster service. I was seated outside and was forgotten about by servers three times, however they were very busy and the servers were extremely apologetic. I just wish they wouldn't have left me out in the cold!!"}
{"text":"The portion is so small compared to similar places
It is fun though to have your cwow melt by hot caramel
Expect to be shocked by the bill. Ridiculously expensive. I could have spent it on a good dinner. The service was also slow however the waitress was patient and helpful to explain the items on the menu 
I don't think I'll visit again. I'll consider Cacao70 or Juliette et chocolate for they serve bigger portions for lower prices and more professionally prepared chocolate.
Finally the ambiance is not that encouraging. We grabbed a table on the area outside the store and it was acceptable."}
{"text":"Charming staff, incredible food, and friendly atmosphere!  The matcha ice cream shake was delicious. On the pricier side, though."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for a delicious dessert. I ordered the King Kong and A cappuccino. The drink arrived  scorchingly hot and burned my tongue. The King Kong was lovely to look at, but the caramel sauce tasted burned. When the waitress came over I told her this, and she suggested that what I was tasting was the salt. I know what salted caramel tastes like, but I was starving so decided to keep eating. After I was nearly done the waitress came over to tell me that I was right, the chef tasted the the caramel and agreed it was burnt. She offered to give me something else for free. After a while that came out.    After 10 minutes my cappuccino was STILL too hot to drink. 
They gave me a discount on my order but was still a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I've visited C'ChoColat on two occasions, once alone and another time with one of my friends: both times were very pleasant. I've tried their Matcha Matcha Man (mason jars Milkshakes) which is made of Vanilla Gelato infused with Matcha green tea, topped with whipped cream, green Kit Kat chocolate bar, and a homemade macaroon (yummy!) as well as their Ham and Cheese Original Classic Crepe with ham and swiss cheese, creamy béchamel sauce and a sunny-side-up egg. Everything tasted very well, the service was very quick and the staff was very attentive and friendly.

I think I've just found a new convivial spot and will be going back there very soon. I recommend this place to all the chocolate lovers."}
{"text":"Their C'Wow signature dessert was so amazing and entertaining. I loved every bit of it & it's perfect for two. I certainly felt fancy and special eating every bite!!!"}
{"text":"Cute, modern chocolate crazy dessert spot downtown. We all tried something different from reasonably priced menu and all of our sweet tooths were content!

I instantly fell in love with the caramel 'choctail' ($10)! It's described as having Baileys, bourbon, and whisky with their chocolate mixed together. Strong, sweet, and delightful after the dinner we had. It came on a cute wood tray with caramel biscuits!

The BFF tried the chocolate banana mason jar milkshake ($15) and liked it as well. It also came with a an array of toppings, drizzles and fixings. The pictures do make these shakes look bigger so don't be intimated of ordering one for yourself. 

Servers are friendly and there's so much on the menu that it definitely deserves another visit when the sweet craving strikes!"}
{"text":"A great place to go if you want hyperglycemia. Their desserts are very creative like their creppucine which is essentially a crepe cut like fettucine and drizzled with chocolate and topped with ice cream and brownie. Their bubble waffle is also amazing. 

However, im removing 1 star because of the long wait we had the last time we went. The service was very long and it took them 15 min to bring us menu, 20 min to order, 30 min to get the food and then another 20 min to get the bill. Maybe they were understaffed that day i dont know. The other times we went it wasn't that bad. 

If you do go there, dont forget your insulin!"}
{"text":"I had the C'Fleur de self and the ham and cheese crepe. I ordered milk chocolate for the hot chocolate (you have a choice of milk, 50%, or 70% chocolate). I have to say it was the best hot chocolate I have ever had.  Our waiter was attentive and very nice. My husband had the Rocky Mountain waffle and enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had the melting dome that has been so popular on Facebook. Delicious and so decadent. With a waffle, fruits, graham, gelato and caramel. Very good quality chocolate. Also has the salted caramel hot chocolate. Also amazing! Service was very nice, a little pushy on the selling but that's okay. Kept asking us if we wanted something to drink over and over again. The only very unpleasant point is that it's extremely loud! Would love to go back to try the Rocky Road waffle."}
{"text":"The desserts here are pretty wild but the service is lacking. They have an awesome chocolate dome dish that is a real show stopper, great for dates or when showing family/friends the city. I've had one of their milkshakes which are more than decadant and worth trying. They also have good coffee, maybe a tad too expensive though. The issue is the service, it really kills it the times I've been here. Cant get water refills, takes forever to get the check and it doesn't matter if its crowded or not."}
{"text":"Got the creppucini. Yes, this dish looks amazing. Strips of crepe mimicking fettucini. I love how the drizzled sauce on top of the ice cream dollop hardens for a nice hard coating. My only recommendation, serve this with two scoops of ice cream! :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place. All the desserts were so creative, cute and insta-worthy. I got the c'wow which was so pretty and tasty too. The dessert itself isn't too large because the shell is hallow but it's rich and creamy enough that you're fully satisfied after!"}
{"text":"Enter major chocolate coma!!

We tried the caramel kiss milkshake, so rich and creamy.  Added a shot of bourbon to it too

Affogato with hazelnut gelato was the perfect combination 

Shared fondue for one... we questioned if it was for two because it was a lot!!!  I totally forgot how good toasted marshmallows were... and add chocolate to that... beat combination ever

Service was also fantastic.  They have loads of savory options as well but we came here to try the desserts and were not disappointed  

Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly disappointing. 

Pros: good cappuccino, but found it pricey ($4.25), considering it is a hop, skip from Myriade where you can get better. Good amount of fruit used in the dishes that call for it. Dark chocolate sauce on our waffle was ok.
Cute interior and friendly staff.

Cons:
Waffle was really bad. Hard and crunchy throughout and very sweet, almost tasted old. Definitely a no.
The chocolate soufflé was more like chocolate syrup. Only the top was baked and the rest was completely liquid. Vanilla ice cream on the side was crazy sweet, very cloying taste, not rich but watery consistency.
The crepe part of the peanut butter crepe concoction was supposedly very thick and not good, although I didn't taste that one. Crepe was also supposedly very dry.
Three desserts, three cappuccinos and one small Pellegrino cost $56 +tip. I wouldn't mind, but when we decide to go out for a treat, we want to actually have it taste like a treat. This was incredibly \"meh\".
Wait time for our beverage was too long as well.
Go to Suite 88 or any other place nearby like Cocoa 70."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening and the place was packed. We got seats right away but waited 30 minutes just for the menu. We were also never served water. After making our order, the waitress promised to bring us snacks, that was never brought as well. I wanted to like this place. The concept is nice and I love desserts. The service was already bad and on top of that the food was not great either. My partner ordered the banana Nutella shake and Rocky Mountain waffle. I got the matcha matcha man mason jar (milkshake). My partner's waffle was ok, nothing amazing. The banana Nutella shake was so not worth it. And my matcha matcha man milkshake was only good on the first 2 sips, the rest of the shake was bland. I guess it was not blended well. The macaron on top of it and the \"matcha\" crumble did not even taste like matcha. The waitress that we got seemed like the only one really working, the other waiter on the floor was barely doing anything.

 I would not come back."}
{"text":"Wow. Something for everyone here. The emphasis is on desserts, and they do not disappoint. There are also savory crepes for those without a sweet tooth. The non-sweet drink selection is small, but the lone Whiskey (Black Label) hit the spot. The service was also very friendly and fast. A must-visit for the cookie monsters visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Entering the building, I knew I made it to Heaven. The fragrant aroma of chocolate hit me instantly and put an immediate smile on my face. If you are looking for dessert, I highly recommend coming here. 

They had a special dessert that looked like a chocolate dome and they drizzled hot caramel on top that melted the dome to uncover gelato underneath (I spied this from across the way and vowed to return with my husband to experience it first hand). Talk about beauty, creativity, and entertainment on one plate. Unless you have an insatiable sweet tooth, I recommend sharing. The portions are huge and the sweetness is, well, a rush of sugar. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach and I wanted to order everything on the menu. Instead, I opted for the staple crepe topped with strawberries, bananas, drizzled with Nutella and a side of vanilla gelato. When the order arrived, I felt like I was on an episode of \"I'll have what Phil's having\" (if you haven't seen it, it's on Netflix and pure joy). 

In the states, places like this would have a line out the door for hours, seriously, hours. This place was convenient to enter, immediately sit at a table, and order. I was able to take all the time I wanted to enjoy and relax and eat chocolate to my heart's content."}
{"text":"For what it is, the desserts here were amazing. We got the Sushi Crepe and Fruit Explosion Waffle. Quality was good as well as their service. 
It does take a little bit to sit inside when it starts to get busy but I would say it was definitely worth while. The pricing is a bit high but your getting fresh fruits and products that are manually prepared for you."}
{"text":"Dropped by for some dessert after dinner. Ordered the C'Wow to share. It definitely had the wow factor! The plate had bite size pieces of waffles and brownies with pistachio gelato in the centre, and topped with a chocolate dome. When the dessert arrived at the table, the server poured warm caramel over the dome to melt the chocolate to expose the goodies inside. 

Every component of the dessert was delicious. The pistachio gelato was made with real ingredients and you can even see tiny pistachio bits here and there. The caramel was not too sweet and the bitterness of the chocolate complimented the overall sweetness of the dessert. 

I would give the place 5 stars but the service was poor so I had to nick off a star. It took us a while to get our order in because the 4 servers on the floor were not paying attention to the tables (we weren't the only table dissatisfied with the service). The food came within a reasonable amount of time but the bill took forever to arrive at the table. It also felt uncomfortable to have the server standing over you while you use the credit card machine."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars

I've wanted to try their famous chocolate dome dessert for a while now and I'm really glad I did! It was so aesthetically pleasing. The portion was good enough for two. 
However, it tastes ok. I think the mix of warm caramel over the cold gelato is polarizing. The crumbles also add a weird texture that isn't felt throughout the whole dessert. 
On looks alone it's a five stars but sadly looks aren't everything. 

The restaurant itself is very comfortable and clean. I also had an awesome waiter! He was super friendly and guided me through the menu. They have new bubble waffles! (instead of hollow squares in the waffle, they \"pop\" out) 
If Michael is reading this, thanks for everything!

I'd definitely come back, there are so many more desserts to try, especially since they are expanding the place this spring."}
{"text":"A essayer!!!
Au premier abord. La place est cute et tres bien désignée ! Super ambiance pour une place a dessert. Jen suis deja réjoui. 
Puis vient le menu... alors la, jai ete bluffé par la quantité de choix qui s'offre a nous! Cest tres nice... on veut gouter a tout et les photos du grand ecran ne nous laisse pas indifferent.....

Mais alors... deception... le milkshake est plus un milk drink...aromatisée. cest pas comme le milkshake traditionnel lourd et plein de saveur. Mais cetait tres goûteux.

Puis jai commander la crepe sucree \"tarte au sucre\" car la photo sur lecran etait alléchante. Mais cest loin de ce que jai vu sur l'écran est ce que jai recu!
Cetait bon mais la jetais déjà cassé!

En tout, cest ok. Sans plus. Acces sur la deco et pas trop le gout!!!

Chance que jetais avec une bonne copine qui adorait tout!

Je leur donnerais une 2e chance"}
{"text":"Zomg! The c'wow is a must! Make sure you have your phone cam ready ;) it's a treat for the eyes and tummy! You get to choose your ice cream flavour too and I we tried the pistachio. Soooooooooo nutty and good mmmmm"}
{"text":"We wanted to get something sweet after a deceiving meal so we went to C'Chocolat and ordered:
1) Mint green tea: a nice little kettle for the price, they served Four O Clock tea (which was a turn off for me, not sure why?)
2) Berry cheesecake waffle:  as fellow yelpers pointed out, the ice cream was very bland and cheap tasting (think chinese buffet...) . The waffle was good! And the the cheesecake frosting with the fresh berries made this desert well balanced! Definitely for the sweet tooth 

Considering the good location, I will probably go back after a fun shopping day!"}
{"text":"I walked in and asked if they do takeout and they said yes. Then I asked them if I could have a chocolate milkshake and they said that they don't serve that here and that if I wanted one I would have to pay 9$ for a milkshake. Really? You're putting less ingredients in than the other shakes you make at your store, so why do I have to pay as much?"}
{"text":"The best if you have a sweet tooth. I visited this place for my dose of a sugar rush with a couple of friends. I immediately felt overwhelmed by all the choices on the menu. Everything looked delicious. We had a very kind waiter who was very patient with his confused clients and helped us make our decision. I had the \"C' wow\" chocolate bomb which was a really fun and tasty experience. It is basically a chocolate dome that is melted by having hot chocolate sauce poured on top. Inside you find little treats like brownies, strawberries etc... While I really enjoyed this, I much rather preferred my friend's dessert which was the cheesecake waffle with gelato on a cone. It was by far the best dessert I have had in a while. While it can be pricey, it is definitely a fun experience. The menu is endless and you also have a whole bunch of interesting smoothies to choose from."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Liked it a lot. My daughter's phone ran out of battery anyone of the waiter even charged it for us. So nice. Great crepes."}
{"text":"Huge selection of desserts. From crazy loaded shakes to fondue and egg waffles. We ordered the \" peanut better\" shake with cane with brownies and a pb cup. The brownies were to die for but the shake was too salty in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love so mush the pistachio ice cream!!!i was so good and rich!i also tried the C wow ....but very disappointed with it..too sweet for me.....I'll be back for the pistachio ice cream for sure !!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, very warm and welcoming environment and divine desserts!!!

The gelato could have been better but we got the C'wow and a regular coffee and it was amazing!!!

This Place is super cute and lovely with funny sayings in frames!

Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and they use tablets to take orders which is pretty cool :D

Gotta gave them five stars because they are first one to offer C'WOW (my life is now complete hahah thank you C'chocolat!)

I am a chocolate lover, but the CWOW was toooo sweet and made me feel kinda sick afterwards...
but it could be just me... It would be great if they offer some small salty snacks to the side juste so that our tastebuds are not being overwhelmed by all the sugar

They got a lot of interesting things on their menu that Im excited to try in the future, for example their cheese cake waffles"}
{"text":"I looooove their Belgian waffles! It's so overwhelmingly sweet but perfect for satisfying my sweet tooth :).

Last time we got the Rocky Mountain Waffle, which is topped with brownies, marshmallow, bananas, cashews, Fleur du sel caramel, and dark chocolate.
Everything mixes so well together, for every bite try to incorporate all the components. I'm craving it as I'm writing this haha. The Fleur du sel caramel stood out for us, we basically licked the plates clean for it.

Another group got the must-try half-chocolate-dome C'Wow, which comes with a dark chocolate dome filled with waffles, brownie, gelato, crumbles, berries, and pecan. The waiter will pour the caramel over the dome to melt the dome and reveal the inside, but you could ask to pour the caramel yourself to control the portion. I find when the waiters themselves pour it the caramel is too much and the sweetness becomes way too overwhelming (who knew that was possible?). 
It's also a lot more fun to pour it yourself!

Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight - it was my second time. Had great food and amazing service! I loved my experience there and would go back. I got to try a lot of menu items since we were a group, including: c'wow chocolate dome, king kong bubble waffle with pistachio ice cream (the best), creppucino, c'caramel hot chocolate drink, etc. What really blew us away was the shawarma and shish taouk crepe paninis; sooooo good. For a dessert place, we were almost more impressed by the savoury food! Our waiter was new but he was great, very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"They have a variety different desserts and they all look so    lovely. I ordered the La vie en rose, which is served with bubble waffle and a strawberry ice cream. It was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of dessert places in the area, but their aesthetic presentation really blew me away! Everything they bring out is instagram worthy. Also, the pricing is competitive (in the field)
I got the perfect parcel crepe, which was a brownie, vanilla gelato wrapped in a crepe with walnuts, strawberries and lots of chocolate drizzle. My only complaint is the crepe was kind of tough. 
My friend got the C'wow (the coveted melting chocolate dome!) so props to them for offering it first. Lots of footage to share."}
{"text":"I returned to this dessert place because my first experience was really great. Now that they added the Hong Kong style egg bubble waffle to their menu I wanted to try them. I ordered Snow White crepe and Hazelnut Dream waffle and Pretty in Pink bubble waffle:
- they claim the bubble waffles to be \"both airy and crisp\" but it wasnt the case. I am pretty sure the normal waffle and the bubble one are made of tye same batter. This makes the bubble waffle too thick and not crispy at all. Being a Hong Kongnese, I can tell you that the insides of a bubble waffle is not supposed to have a bublly surface. I took a picture of it after eating the toppers. 
- the bubble waffles were soggy after 10minutes and it is not supposed ro happen if they were crispy 
- the crepe and the waffle are delicious and I would definitely return to try more flavors
-the service was so so. After she took my order the food took a while to come and I understand because the platting is important. Then she gave me the 2 first dishes and shortly after the 3rd plate. At that time, she is already checking if the food was fine but i didn't even have the chance to eat them yet..... That was the one and only time she checked on my table. The service could be better as i wanted to tell her that the bubble waffle was really disspointed.
- the price was normal for a dessert place. Comparabke to Juiliette et Chocolat."}
{"text":"This place is BEYOND decadent! I went with a friend and we each got one of their dessert cocktails, the Red Velvet and Blackberry Mojito. The presentation was fun, and the flavors were sophisticated, not just sweet on sweet on sweet. They give you large straws, so whether you go milkshake or smoothie, they're easy to drink/eat. And the presentation just has such a stupendous wow factor! We'd been tearing up the downtown, checking out bars and restaurants but this was an easy favorite. The staff was efficient and enthusiastic, the menu was full of pictures that are just scandalous food porn. And the drinks are so inventive, delicious, and beautiful they're well worth the price. 

TREAT YOURSELF!"}
{"text":"So, we don't really have sit-down dessert places here in South Florida and because of that, I didn't really know I was missing anything. Now that I've been to C'ChoColat, I am MAD. Why don't we have places like this near me!? 
I was sent to this place after watching a video of C'Wow on Instagram. We were pretty set on ordering that when we got there, but we definitely got confused after reading the menu. We were between the C'Wow or those cool waffles. Ultimately, we decided to go with what had drawn us in in the first place and ended up with the C'Wow. It truly is the most perfect dessert - sweet, salty, cold, hot, crunchy, smooth, fruity - so sad I live so far away from this place."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place with family as had heard so many good reviews! 
Entering the place, it is evident to see they have worked hard to sell the theme as the interior is very bright and vibrant with the letter 'c' jumping out everywhere. 
The menu has a lot of choice, the variety of hot chocolates definitely being a highlight!
We ordered different types of waffles and crepes with various fruit fillings. To our surprise, the portions were extremely small for the price we paid (similar prices to its competitors)... Even if two people wanted to share, it was too small unlike other places where you get a full waffle, here you are only given a piece of waffle! Maybe it has been aimed at the more diet conscious but for someone who was looking forward to a big treat, this was very disappointing and did not meet the expectations I had of this place.
Taste wise it is delicious like most of the other chocolate places but I think I will be sticking to those places in future :)"}
{"text":"I stopped in here after a delicious dinner and was not disappointed.  I've never been to a sit down dessert bar and was pleasantly surprised. The waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful, they carry tablets and can show pictures of different options if you have questions.

I had the c'wow and it was very tasty.  Definitely good for splitting with another person, I recommend getting hazelnut gelato in the middle for a flavor play.  I thought the pageantry of pouring hot caramel over the dome was fun! And all of it was delicious.  Very sweet, but what else would you expect?

I also ordered the classic hot chocolate but had to take it to go, I was full of my vitamin c by the time I ate some of the c'wow."}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice, restaurant is clean and location is great. Everything but the food was perfect. Ingredients seemed to be cheap and possibly pre-made...given how quickly my order arrived, I'm guessing that's a solid assumption. The brownie tasted like something you'd buy at a gas station when your blood sugar is low - it has sugar but absolutely no taste. The ice cream tasted like ice w sugar - no cream. And, the \"crepe\" tasted like almost nothing. 

Sorry to say - not worth the visit."}
{"text":"One of the best dessert place in my opinion! Great varieties and prices. I also tried their 'dome' dessert which isn't on the menue. You can always ask for it and it comes as a chocolate dome that melts beautifully when the waiter pours hot chocolate on it. It is simply delicious! The service is also pretty good,"}
{"text":"Very cute chocolate place. It's up there as one of the top dessert places in Montreal.
Friendly staff and really good chocolate.
Also a great date spot."}
{"text":"Simply for the size of the menu the lack of Gluten Free chocolate or crepe ( rice, buckwheat, almond flour) is just a huge shame. More lactose free and gluten free options wouldn't be that hard at all.

2016- about 65% population are lactose intolerant, 15% of population has gluten antibodies suspecting sensitivity and inflammation after digestion, 6% are gluten allergic intolerant sensitive because of the symptoms and some of them are completely intolerant due to celiac disease."}
{"text":"this was a place we found online when looking for the best matcha desserts in montreal. They have a very unique matcha milkshake that was very very delicious. The presentation is also cool with a mint kit kat dunked in the shake. 

The place is clean and has a lot of space if you are coming with a group. The service was also on point so you are in good hands here."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff! Got the C'wow and Pistache Pizzazz. The ghazel el banat was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is basically a dream come true for me ... everything is centered around chocolate - literally what more could anyone want????

First things first, I had to get a hot chocolate, which is really fun because they give you steaming hot milk and a chocolate shot which you mix into it. That was awesome. The texture turns out really nice and smooth after stirring for a bit, and the taste is so much better than the instant hot chocolate we're used to. 

Next up was what I came here for ... the C'Wow (pronounce \"say wow\") - the magic dome of chocolate that melts as they pour piping hot caramel over it ... only to reveal an inner level of ice cream and brownies ... I MEAN COMEEEE ONNNNN!

It was D-E-Licious. A little decadent (obviously) but suuuuper yummy and the textures were all there ... the yummy melted chocolate, the tough brownie, the cool ice cream. I just can't stop thinking about it. Definitely recommend this ... no doubt at all!

This is among the few places I'd say I'd go back to when traveling - a rare honor lol

Stay Cheerful ;)"}
{"text":"This was a great find during our trip to Montreal. We decided to get the giant chocolate dome they drizzle hot caramel on. It's their signature item and for good reason. The caramel melts and mixes with the hard dome of chocolate and it all forms a decadent pool for all the inside goodies which consist of gelato, brownie pieces hazelnuts and pralines, strawberries and blackberries. My only complaint would be that there could be a few more items thrown inside however I think the portion was good. It is so decadent you would probably get sick eating too much of it.
Another guest in our party tried the hazelnut gelato over a waffle and it was also very good. The gelato was made well and the waffle was freshly made on the spot.
The greatest asset to this establishment is the commitment to quality ingredients. They do not cheapen the experience by throwing in snickers bars and trying to pretend like they invented something. In a town with a surprisingly low amount of ice cream places, this place was a great find!"}
{"text":"Came here for a stop during a bachelorette weekend. It was everything we dreamed and more. I shared a C'wow and black jack with a couple ladies and we were blown away and scarfed down the entire thing. This place is like dessert heaven. The C'wow is a great showcasing dessert for video but I thought the Black Jack Waffle was yummier. Other people in the group got the hot chocolate drinks. Our whole party enjoyed every dish and I wish we were locals so we could visit this place more often."}
{"text":"Dessert was pretty amazing -- went on a Friday night waited a fair bit to get a table everything was great but the service was defiantly lacking"}
{"text":"Its not bad. You can tell it's really catered to women. Me and my partner had the creppucine which is basically a desert pasta with crepe, ice cream, brownies and chocolate. The chocolate sauce makes it taste really good even though the brownies were a bit dry."}
{"text":"Ca mériterait plutôt un 3,5/5. 
Les assiettes \"sucrées\" sont toujours belles et gourmandes. À date, tout ce que j'ai pu goûter là bas étaient également très bons (j'y suis allée 4 fois et j'ai seulement pris du sucré). Le service est parfois un peu long, même quand il y a peu de monde, mais ca reste dans des délais acceptables.
Pour les mordus de chocolat comme moi, vous ne pourrez qu'aimer la place!
Il y a également un chocolat au lait végétal pour mon plus grand bonheur :)"}
{"text":"I hope you like sugar! The crepe was delicious, and we added two scoops of ice cream- I'm glad we did because there was a ton of Nutella sauce and the ice cream helped water it down a bit! Super delicious though!"}
{"text":"Sper place, je vous recommande d'y aller! c tlm merveilleux! mais préparer vos portefeuille ça coûte chère en titi! mais c tlm bourrant que ça prends carrément la place d'un repas!L'entroit est neuf donc cute et propre et le service est vraiment cool!"}
{"text":"Great place in a not so busy area of town and close to our hotel!  Affogato:  liked that they bring the espresso and gelato deconstructed, as with the cafe mocha with the hot chocolate, espresso and dark chocolate sauce in separate vessels for us to combine.  Tried the dark chocolate crepe with bananas and strawberries.  Big crepe and overall well prepared.  Nice atmosphere great location and service and good value for the experience."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was bad. 
I got both the soufflé and waffle. 
The soufflé wasn't baked properly at all, it still had lots of liquid inside and just a little bit of the outside layer was solid form. 
The waffle suppose to be a thick, dense and sweet tasty dish. However, it was loaded with too much chocolate and make the waffle soggy and tasteless. 
I would have to say they disappointment me."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place but gets flooded with students. Has humongous crepes but the quality is just standard. nothing spectacular. the décor and service is top key though. Gelato was also just OK.

All in all this place is OK, nothing special, nothing bad. Just decent crepes.

However the wait for the food is kinda long."}
{"text":"Lots of choice at this chocolate spot.  I even saw some people eating green things.  They may have been vegetables 

I ordered the a bubble waffle which I found to be quite large.  Tasty with lots of chocolate sauce and delicious strawberries.  My wife ordered the souffle which does take about 15 minutes to prep.  They do warn you so that you are not left sitting there wondering what's up.  I would recommend that if you order a coffee and want it with your souffle that you mention it.  Our coffees came out right away and as a result I was finished my espresso before our dishes arrived.  Not a big deal.  The chilled water went well with the heavy chocolate dish."}
{"text":"The milkshakes and desserts are beautiful, creative, and mouthwatering, no doubt about it. And the service we got was exceptional, so nice and on point. But the food itself isn't so wow, especially for the price. I felt I was paying more for the hype and the art, less for the culinary experience  still fun to go at least once with friends for a fun time"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I have the BIGGEST sweet tooth, and have wanted to check off the melting chocolate balls off my bucket list for a long time now, so you can imagine how excited I was to go to this place! 

My friend and I came on a Saturday night and shared the C'Wow (which is a chocolate dome that melts when you pour hot caramel on top of it, revealing ice cream, a liege waffle, and brownie bits). Although there wasn't that much food on the plate, boy was it filling! A great dessert to share, especially since it is a little on the pricier side at $17, but a really cool experience! Also noteworthy is the service - the staff were all super friendly and the food came out quick. I would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone, and would come back again to try out everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"The ultimate experience is exactly that.. an \"experience\". The pork is so tender and the different flavors mix in perfectly. The Mac and Cheese is a big plate, and the best part is the meat portion of the dish."}
{"text":"Great place for fancy and creative desserts.The atmosphere here is  great for hanging out. It is very clean and the service is wonderful. The waiters here are very professional and friendly. Each waiter carried around an iPad which has photos of the menu just for customers it they had questions. 

So I had their signature C'Wow (Chocolate dome melted which was melted by warm
caramel sauce. I requested NO pecans and they were able to adjust. It was fun while it last and it was honestly a pretty small portion. Even after my full meal I was able to eat most of it. It tasted like lots of chocolate mix with ice cream and some fruits so expect it to be very sweet but they do provide everyone a glass of tap water.

Overall I think it's a nice place and of course fancy it is going to be $$$$. So I think this isn't a place to go daily but more of a occasional kind thing."}
{"text":"We found the place on Yelp after looking for the best dessert restaurants in Montreal. 
When we arrived we were lucky to get seated right away. The place was packed for a Sunday evening, which probably meant that the food was good.
Service was good, both waiters were very nice and always checking up on us.
We ordered the s'mores and one of the bubble waffles. Food was good but extremely sweet (as expected). If you are into really sweet stuff you would like it. We couldn't handle one plate each, I'd recommend ordering one and sharing. 
Overall the food was good. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I left this place CHOCOLATE WASTED!!! For anyone with a serious craving for chocolate, this place is for you!

My friends and I indulged in the C'Wow and S'mores. Make sure you have your cameras ready to film the C'Wow! They pour a warm caramel sauce over a chocolate dome to unveil the center (Liege waffle, gelato,  brownie, mixed berries, a crumble, and pecans). Not only did it look amazing, but it tasted amazing too. The S'mores weren't as spectacular, but definitely delicious! They serve it in a cast iron skillet with melted chocolate at the bottom and gooey roasted marshmallows on top. It's served with the graham crackers on the side so you can eat the chocolate and marshmallows like a dip. 

If I'm ever back in Montreal, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went to you only for dessert and this place is out of the world! We were celebrating a birthday and they took l extra special care of us. Lovely presentation and their signature dessert the C'wow was as advertised - it blew us away. So unique and special. C'était très bon. Il y avait des waffles dans le C'wow."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant doesn't need words. Look at the photos and decide for yourself if you can afford to miss it. Organismic desserts heaven!!!!!"}
{"text":"The most amazing dessert place I had ever been to and I'm from NY/NJ. Totally loved this place and it was even better because it was literally 4 store fronts down from our AirBNB. 

We went here every single night while we were in Montreal. We had the huge chocolate ball that melted when the server poured warm caramel over it. The following day we had a strawberry waffle and a cheese cake waffle I believe. The presentation was amazing and the portions were more than generous. Everything was perfect and tasted DELICIOUS! Definitely a must if you're in downtown Montreal. 

Service was also great. Servers showed us pictures if we wanted to see it before we ordered. Which was great."}
{"text":"I love this place and will go again.  I made a point of visiting to get the chocolate dome dessert and it didn't disappoint.  What a cute little place."}
{"text":"The design of the store is pretty simple yet nice. Came here for some dessert. When we first entered there was no hostess, no one greeted us even though they seen us enter.  It took about 5 minutes for the servers to greet and seat us.  

The service was alright. The server was able to recommend us a few different types of desserts. 

We ordered the famous C'wow, the chocolate dome. 
When the server brought the dessert. They do not leave you with the hot caramel to pour on yourself at your pace. They allow you to pour it yourself but they would stand there and wait for you. It makes you feel pressured as they are watching you take pictures of the dessert and waiting for you to drizzle the hot caramel over the chocolate dome. The amount of caramel the server pour on top of the dome was a little too much for my liking. It was really sweet and sticky. Inside the dome there is waffles, brownie and a scoop of gelato of your choice. 
The waffle inside the dome is really hard and dry.  The brownies inside were good though. The gelato, we ordered hazelnut. It was good but the scoop of ice cream was really small. 

We also ordered the Manson mug milkshake. The milk shake didn't have enough Nutella flavour, tasted mostly like banana. 

The last thing we ordered was the sushi crepes. They were  good but it's nothing special. 

I feel like this place is only good as a one time thing. As it is overpriced.  The dessert cost like a price of a meal. But it is Instagram worth. 

As for cleanliness the store is pretty neat and tidy but the washroom not so much.  There are small black flies on the washroom walls. They were not food flies, they are bigger than food flies. 

Overall, will not come again. Everything is pretty average tasting."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon for mothers day we decided to make it sweet and visited C Chocolat ... Usually after a big dinner rare there is place left for dessert, so this time we took precuation and had a light lunch so that we can all order desert and savour it, when we usually go to dessert places like juliette chocolat or cacao 70 the portions are huge ! But at CChocolat the waffles are REALLY good but so tiny :(!! The gelato are delicious, what i love was the big tv screen that showed a picture of all the desserts on the menu :-)"}
{"text":"Taste was not bad but not amazing either, compared to other places. Very large portions, so eat a light dinner/lunch beforehand if you want to come here for desert.

All the dishes looked very pretty, and some very childisly over dressed.
Service was excellent, very friendly and comfortable staff, and clean bathrooms.

I ordered the Rocky Mountain waffles (not bubble waffles)
Waffle itself was way too soft, and had no crisp to it at all :( just mushy like a cake.
Happy that they used mini marshmallows, except they didn't toast all of them, so many of them were still uncooked and not gooey, so a bit pointless. Though the ones that were toated were great.

Some of the bananas were brown, which was gross and unapetizing :(
They should have at least coated their banana slices with something to prevent them from browning. 

Their salted caramel sauce and white chocolate sauces did not stand out much, and couldn't really notice their flavours. I mistook the white chocolate drizzle for being a dimmed down version of condensed sweetened milk, because it really did not scream white chocolate at all.

The idea of adding cachew nuts sounds nice, but really was not nessesary in this dish, because their only positive role I could notice was that they at least gave the dish a different texture which was crunch, and that could have been accomplished with any type of crushed nuts, therefore this queen of the nuts felt underwhelming and added a useless expense.

The brownie chunks themselves were fine, just more of a garnish.
Though I still felt the way this dish was constructed was all together underwhelming, however it was at least not overly sweet. Although for their prices, I was expecting something more phenominal.

If I were to make this at home (which come on, not hard), I would have make a nice airy thick CRISPY waffle (d'uh, crispy outside and slightly softer inside), and make a thin brownie square to put ontop (not heavy so the waffle under wouldn't have time to get soggy), leaving that nice crispy top layer of cooked brownie that happens in the oven, which was absent here, and made the inside of the brownie more goey fudgy and less cake-like. Then I would add THIN slices of just half or a quarter of a banana, no more is needed. Their thick chunks of banana around the plate was not very pleasing for a 13$ dish... Sprinkle some crushed nuts (any lol even peanuts would have been fine, or hazelnuts ). Then I'd drizzle just the caramel with a bit more of a sea salt kick to it, and then added an even layer of marshmallows ontop so they could toast evenly, and not unevenly due to them piling them ontop and scattered around the plate the way they did. The white chocolate (or their other chocolate options) was really not needed at all because there was already too many other flavours that covered it up.

Even if they had replaced the cachews with crushed up peanut brittle, that would have been much more memorable, and something I wouldn't want to do at home myself, and would want to go out for.

The only thing that makes me feel more at ease for paying this price, is that they make their own ingredients, so it's not cheap factory made chocolates. That makes me happy, though with all their interesting quality ingredients they have, they could use more creativity in putting them together to help them compliment eachother more. 

Their menu looks very exciting. They even have arabic and mexican inspired items, as well as some more rare ones too, so this deffinetely seems interesting and I wish them good luck."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant discret sur la petite rue bishop. Excellent, un peu dispendieux, mais beaucoup de choix !! Tout était très bon  Bon service et belle terrasse."}
{"text":"Ok so the food was good but the service was so bad.  I was there fairly early in the day with a friend and yes we were able to place our order in a good amount of time, and received our food the same.  However, no one came back after our plates were cleared to ask if we needed anything else. We waited over 1h for the waitress to come see us.  Needless to say that there was a couple right next to us who got served and got to pay fairly quickly.  The waitress could have turned around and ask if we needed anything else but it's as though we didn't exist.  I even called her while she was right next to me and she totally didn't pay attention to me."}
{"text":"It's a Sunday morning and we sat beside the window where there was a great view of the street. We had a Middle-eastern style crêpe and a fruit fondu. That was the best crepe I've ever tried and the fruits are fresh~So delicious!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Montreal, and this was a great place for dessert! It was very busy on a Saturday Night, so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Been there twice , tried hot drinks, waffles and the chocolate dôme. Not impressed by any of these. Just average. So for the quality , it's pricy"}
{"text":"Really tasty sandwiches/wraps, many of which are gluten free! My personal fave is the C'Habibi, but you pretty much can't go wrong. 

That said, the main event at C'ChoColat are the shakes. These milky, frothy behemoths are the perfect thing to cool down on a hot day or get cozy on a cold one. I got the matcha shake, and it was everything you could ever want. Despite being covered in kit kats and whipped cream, it still wasn't too sweet. Plus, you could really taste the matcha, which was an added bonus. 

Perfect for dates, work lunches or some much deserved alone time."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
Located on Rue Bishop and Rue Saint-Catherine Ouest at a lively downtown area near bars, shops, and restaurant. Free parking was limited, try to look out for paid street parking.  

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Our server was super personable and friendly. I felt like they were understaffed on the night we went to this place, but he was very professional and organized everything very well. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
Modern, spacious, great place to grab dessert and hang out with friends. 

[QUALITY] - 3/5
Chocolate was high-quality and complex. All other ingredients were just average and not worth the price. 

[ORDER] - 3/5
Mochaholic - $14.00: crêpe dressed with dark chocolate ganache, coffee gelato, covered with chocolate and cocoa nibs. The chocolate was very decadent and had bitter tones that balanced out the slightly sweet coffee gelato. I liked the complexity of flavours, but the crêpe itself was not fluffy enough and hardened in the area that touched the gelato. There was also a bland cake cone on the gelato that tasted like cardboard.  

[OVERALL] - 3.5/5
I was underwhelmed by the crêpe, but the chocolate was pretty rich and flavourful. I would not recommend this place for their crêpes because there are plenty of less expensive and better places for that in Montreal."}
{"text":"A friend saw this new place and we decide to stop by for lunch. Didn't really know what to expect, but we all left raving! I ordered from the lunch menu and had a BLT on waffle. Yes, waffle! They cooked the bread for the sandwich in a waffle iron and it was soft, perfectly baked and delicious. The ingredients were fresh and avocado sauce tied the whole sandwich together. The dish came with a side salad that complemented the sandwich really well. There was also a fruit kebab with milk chocolate sauce and coffee, which rounded off the meal perfectly. We were in a rush to get back to work, so they offered the coffee to go, very considerate. Overall great experience, and great service! Thank you and we'll definitely see you soon!"}
{"text":"Visiting here from Toronto for the weekend and saw this place across the street from my hotel, went in sat down and looked over the menu. The Rocky Mountain Waffle sounded really awesome but then nobody came to my table for about 10-15 minutes, I was seated on the patio and the place wasn't even busy. I can't understand why nobody would come over and take my order, lots of eye contact was made and nothing was done. I'll never return to this place again, something so simple and nothing"}
{"text":"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing... this place is the place to be, the place to go. They serve the best crepes I've never had. Fresh fruits, tasty flavours, every bite takes you a step forward on your way to heaven. I've never been this much happy, fulfilled. Great customer service, the waiter made my friend and I so comfortable, very pleasant, nice and he cared so much about our experience there. 
Will definitely go back and invite you to do the same. Don't miss it. It's paradise on earth. 
Also very affordable, each of us paid around 30-33$ tax included"}
{"text":"SO. MUCH. CHOCOLATE.  That is how you summarize a trip to C'chocolat in one sentence.  As the title suggests this place is a paradise for chocaholics serving up chocolate-based drinks (alcoholoc and non-alcoholic) and chocolate-based desserts.  We were here because my friend had won a contest which entitled us to some free chocolate goodness.

C'chocolat is located right down and has only been around about four months or so.  The interior is fairly small and simple.  There is even a photo booth with a tablet rigged up to it so you and your friends can take a selfie.

For the adults in the crowd consider getting a choctail which is chocolate cocktail.  Being a cold winter night I thought I would get the C'Aztec because it was served hot.  This contained hot chocolate, vanilla cinnamon Baileys, Sailor Jerry and chili powder.  I liked how it was more savory than sweet and it was very soothing considering outside it was quite cold.

The dome is quite literally a dome of chocolate.  When it was served to us our waitress then poured hot chocolate over it melting it away to reveal the contents which were fruit, chunks of waffles and brownies, caramel and ice cream.  The ice cream flavour depends on which one you choose.  Sharing the dome among two people is a good idea.  While the portion size might not seem that big it is very sweet which will make eating a whole one very challenging.  I found it a little too sweet for my liking but the individual components like the brownies were quite good.

Service-wise it as pretty good.  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job of making recommendations for us.  While one of the drinks were were brought was wrong she was quick to correct the mistake when it was brought to her attention.  She also left us the drink we hadn't ordered if we wanted to try it at no extra charge.

The prices are what you would expect to pay for downtown.  Like I said we got our food for free but in looking at the menu the prices seemed reasonable.  Most of the desserts were between $7 and $15 which is what you would expect to pay for the neighbourhood.

All I know is that after my first visit here I need to go back to try out more of their menu offerings.  There was loads of other items on the menu that sounded very enticing including S'mores.  Anyways I definitely want to get back here if I can help it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding dessert place, not only are the desserts amazing but the prices are super reasonable. The service is always super friendly every time I go there !"}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat at C'Chocolat, I've seen so many pictures of their milkshakes and it looked great with all the candy decorations and the cute mason jar where they put the milkshake. The restaurant can get packed and sometimes you might have to wait for a free table but not for so long! Staff are really friendly! I've had the red velvet milkshake, which was amazing!!! Their milkshakes are served in a mason jar on a chopping board, with cute toppings and decorations such as candy. I also had their Golden Ticket milkshake which was a very chocolaty milkshake topped with cotton candy and other candies, and more candy on the chopping board! I loved both milkshakes! I've also had their chocolate ball where they poured some sort of chocolate syrup over it which melted the ball and inside it was one scoop of gelato (of your choice) with brownies and pieces of waffles and fruits around it, it was amazing, i was kinda disappointed that it was only one small scoop of gelato. I also had their chocolate pasta, yes chocolate pasta!! It was pasta with with chocolate sauce, sprinkled with whites chocolate as the cheese and bits of brownies, with a scoop of gelato in the middle! It was so good, I never knew pasta and chocolate would make a good combo!! I love this place so much! I yet still have to try their savoury dishes!!"}
{"text":"Service is quick. A decent dessert joint, usually filled with students. Staff is attentive and friendly. It gets pretty busy in the evening after 6."}
{"text":"It was the second time I had came here with a friend (had to come back)! This place is warm and cozy, the staff is really kind and know their menu items well. Their menu items are very creative, delicious, and affordable. Great place to catch up with friends or even bring a date.
I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Vast Variety options from desserts to lunch meals. The first impression is the cacao aroma, sweet, warm and cozy. My friends and I orders their specialty \"Chocolate dome \" great experience, but the taste is just average. Their smoothies are good (according to my friends). In general: 
Decoration: 3/5 
Food tastes: 4/5
Food decoration : 5/5 ( exactly same with photo) no complaints here. 
Service: 5/5 Staff are extremely helpful."}
{"text":"They big boom is the melting chocolate semi-ball that's not on the menu, but you can order it upon request. It's cute to see but too sweet to eat, the drinks are good but their dessert needs more sweetness balancing, they should work on how to blend flavours together instead of drowning clients with sweetness"}
{"text":"The ice cream was fine, but nothing special and way overpriced. Our service was particularly bad, the waitress' attitude made it very clear that if we didn't want to order more, we should immediately pay our bills and leave right away. I would never come back."}
{"text":"It's been a while I wanted to try this place. I went with my mom to try it out and I ordered the soufflé with hazelnut ice cream and white chocolate and my mom ordered the almond hot chocolate. The staff was super friendly and warned that my dessert will take 20 minutes to make which was fine. The soufflé mixed with the chocolate and ice cream was exactly what I wanted and needed at that moment. However I was a bit disappointed at the small amount of chocolate I got since I saw in other pictures they serve a bigger amount on the side. I tried my moms hot chocolate and didn't like it at all as the almond syrup they added tasted very artificial. Overall we had a nice experience and I feel I go back for their signature desserts."}
{"text":"Came across this spot while exploring the streets- and I'm glad we did! Perfect for lunch, dessert, and chocolatey drinks with great service and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Quelle plaisir ! 
Dans une petite rue tranquille pas loin du métro Concordia & de la rue Sainte-Catherine se cache ce petit restaurant bien agencée. Ce jour-là, il n'y avait qu'une dizaine de clients c'était calme ! Avec mon amie, on a été accueilli chaleureusement dès notre arrivée. La serveuse nous a vraiment bien conseillée sur ce qu'elle préférait. Au cas où, des petites photos de plats défilent sur un écran derrière la cuisine, ce qui peut vraiment aidé lorsqu'on est compliqué. Les prix sont abordables, un peu moins cher que Juliette & Chocolat. J'ai choisi un chocolat chaud au chocolat blanc Oreo : Un délice, le chocolat n'était pas trop sucré et vraiment bien présenté, de même pour ma crêpes au caramel, noix de pécans et bananes. J'ai été étonnée ! Et mon amie a choisi une crêpe salée original assaisonnée comme il fallait et un milkshake ! On a été ravie & on y retournera :)"}
{"text":"CHOCOLAAAAATE 
Yes, I am contributing into the vast majority of people who likes chocolate, especially dark chocolate, bitter dark chocolate, very bitter.

I came here with high hopes. Hunting for a dark chocolate crêpe, I dove into the rich and mouth-watering menu. My eyes reading through every word and glancing at every pictures, I read until I could find those three words: \"dark chocolate\" & \"crêpe\". The hunt has been a success. I've hunted down this bitterness. Satisfiction within my grasp and within my mouth. Mmmmmh... yes, it is the Mochaholic. Behold! 

And yes I strongly recommend the Mochohalic for anyone who likes or can stand the taste of dark chocolate. It was a perfect blend of sweetness and bitterness. Not too bitter nor too sweet. Drinks are good too, but I'd rather have something to chew!

Also, there might be a waiting queue outside. But they were kind enough to give us cups of hot chocolate while we were waiting!"}
{"text":"This place has a variety of different desserts. The presentation of desserts are lovely, they are instagram worthy. 

The desserts here are just average. The portion of ice cream in the C'WOW is extremely little. There is barely any ice cream inside. There was also brownies and waffles inside. The brownie was delicious but the waffles tasted hard and stale. This chocolate dome was drizzled with caramel. The caramel was extremely sweet. I would recommend that if you were to order this dessert you should ask the waiter to drizzle less caramel on it. 

The second thing we ordered was the sushi crepe. The sushi crepe was just a regular crepe with banana thats rolled into the shape of sushi. It came with a side of nutella. But i felt like they did not give enough nutella. It only came in a little bowl on the side. We've noticed that the sushi crepe ordered by the people next to us came with chopsticks but ours did not. Which kinda defeated the purpose of sushi crepe. It was just like eating a regular crepe. 

We also ordered the Banana Nutella milkshake in a manson mug. Presentation of this was nice but the milkshake tasted mostly like banana and lacked nutella flavour. 

Food: Average, but presentation is nice
Price: Pricey, 3 desserts here is the price of a meal somewhere else.
Service: Was good, the waiter was well educated about the menu and was able to give opinions and recommendations."}
{"text":"Great smoked salmon crepe and grown up hot chocolate.  Excellent service.  I will definitely return to try the dessert crepes."}
{"text":"Came here twice during my trip to Montreal. Once just for dessert and the other time for lunch. I must say the desserts here are phenomenal and are worth 4.5 stars. The lunch, however, was a bit disappointing.

The night we came for dessert I ordered a chocolate shake and my friend ordered a s'mores hot chocolate. We also ordered fondue to share. Everything was tasty and phenomenal. Service was great as well.

When we came back the following day for lunch, it was definitely a lackluster experience. Although the sandwiches we ordered were not terrible, they weren't great either. The sandwiches we got were on \"waffles\" (made from pizza dough). I really think the \"waffles\" ruined it for me.

I highly recommend you just come here for dessert."}
{"text":"After dinner on crescent street we were looking for some dessert. Something kept pointing us to C'ChoColat. 

Service was really quick, and he is a great job of pointing out some of the staff and customer favorites. One of them was a dessert called the blackjack, which was essentially a bubble waffle, chocolate drizzled all over it, strawberries, brownie pieces, and chocolate ice cream.

It was basically a chocolate dream. My wife and I made it disappear in less than five minutes. It was so delicious. Something for everyone, me and my sweet tooth, and her and her love of dark chocolate.

We are already making plans to come back tomorrow night for an encore!  Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Really nice ambiance. It gets really really busy. The wait was about 30 minutes at 9pm out the door. They were kind about it and brought out small samples of hot chocolate and fudge brownie bites to keep us in line. 

The menu is pretty extensive for a dessert bar and the space gets pretty crowded. I love this place for its creativity and design of the desserts."}
{"text":"Went here while it was busy and thought it was alright for desert but nothing too special.

Food: we ordered crepes and enjoyed them but they didn't live up to the hype of the descriptions I think.

Service: super slow. They were busy but we waited a long time for our orders.

Price: definitely has room for improvement here. I feel like for a crepe without any uncommon or expensive ingredients it was pushing it.

Ambiance: loud, it seems. A bit too much for my taste since I was looking for a relaxed place for a dessert after going out for dinner."}
