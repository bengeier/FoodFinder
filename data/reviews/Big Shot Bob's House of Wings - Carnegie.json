{"text":"150+ sauces is insane! Fast friendly service.  Parking is an issue though. Wings were great. Comparable to a few other places I go for wings.  My only complaint is that they were incredibly stingy on the ranch/blue cheese and celery.  I bought 26 wings and got ONE tiny cup and a half a handful of celery for all of them. REALLY?  Why even ask if I wanted any.
Regardless, I would go back for more wings (I'll bring my own dip) and would like to try the subs and gyros as long as they use actual tzatziki sauce and not sour cream"}
{"text":"I was introduced to the Big shot Bob's House of Wings when I used to live in Kennedy Township. The Coraopolis store would deliver. OMG these wings are out of this world!! Soo many flavors, which are all tremendous btw. But my personal favorites are the \"Walk\" and \"Talk of Beaver Falls; if you want a milder garlicky version, try their \"Pookie\"! When I moved to the Green tree area, I saw the Carnegie BSBs area opened their doors...yep you can say one happy girl!! Now I'm even MORE impressed with their new location & that they are selling the wings like the other locations! BSBs Carnegie is a must try for sure - especially if you love variety."}
{"text":"It pains me to say it, but my family has decided we won't be ordering from here anymore. When they first opened, their wings were fantastic. We recommended them to everyone. Lately, though, the wings are dry as a bone with little to no sauce on them. With each \"one more chance\" we would even ask for them to be \"saucy\", and they seemed to think the exact opposite was the best course of action. It's a shame because their flavor selection is great and they are always very nice! Hopefully we'll hear friends or family say the wings are back to \"normal\" but, until then, we'll be looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"We got 4 different types of wings, chicken tenders, fries and a burger and it was fantastic! These are my new favorite wings in Pittsburgh. My favorite of the 4 we got were the the talk of beaver falls and the black and gold wings and they were ridiculously good!! Crispy, saucy and just plain delicious. I have a feeling we will be eating here a lot. In fact it is my request for Mother's Day!! We picked up last time but I am hoping their delivery area includes our house. So good, so so good!"}
{"text":"GREAT WINGS. went to BSB on the recommendation of a friend. The wings were excellent and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"These wings are delicious. So many interesting flavors, but I doubt I'll ever get anything other than Honey Bunny, the second flavor I tried.  They are fabulous!  The staff has all been nice, the only downfall is the parking lot, especially if they are busy."}
{"text":"I enjoyed every step of my experience within this restaurant. The place is clean and the people working there are down to earth and polite. I had great and fast service. Plus the most important part is the food was amazing! I love their wings."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and it did not disappoint. There are so many delicious flavors of wings and I love the Pittsburgh steak salad. I will be visiting again in the near future."}
{"text":"Listen, these people never get my order right. I'm done !!

#blocked !!!!!!!!!!!!

EVERYTIME I order they mess it up. They don't have the sauce i want. 

Over rated!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is close to our house and I've been wanting to try for awhile, so called and ordered an order for pick up. Waited the allotted 45 minutes before stopping in to pick up but the order was still not ready. It was a Sunday during football season so I understand being backed up, but we waited an additional 10 minutes for our order. I ordered an order of 13 wings, 6 wings, and a large fry and the total came to $28 which is pretty pricey for wings in my opinion, but whatever. Got home only to find the fries were not in my bag. I called the restaurant to let them know they forgot my fries and they said I could either come back for them or they could credit my card. Not wanting to go back out again I asked them to just credit my card for the $5 difference for the fries. A few days later I check my statement and the card was not credited, I was charged the whole $28. I'm already annoyed and it's not worth another call and explanation over a $5 charge, but still it's just an annoying experience especially being my first time patronizing the restaurant. The bright spot was that the wings were very good and they have a lot of flavor options, but the mismanagement of order time, correctness of order, and fixing errors to the order soured my first experience and not sure that I will give them another try. 

Also parking is difficult, save yourself the trouble and just have it delivered."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoy wings. We are always looking for an excellent go to wing's restaurant.

The restaurant is easy to find. The parking isn't great but it's more of a pick up restaurant than a sit down. 

The options of flavors = tremendous! There are so many options to pick from and I want to try them all. We order 19 wings with fries.  We ordered the wings over the fries . I didn't really like that because the fries are soggy to me but my boyfriend lovedddd it. It is definitely worth a try! Don't get me wrong , it's good, just not for me.

The wings were crispy and hot! They were made while we were there. They do take about 20 minutes to make so call ahead and they will be ready! 

Over all, we will return. The sauces were great and there was so much over flow to dip them in. But the sauce does not make the wings soggy at all! They are still super crispy and good !"}
{"text":"Definitely order ahead- advised 20 mins for 13 wings and an order of fries. Took close to 40 mins. Fries were soggy but wings were good. Less than stellar staff too- loudly talking about how much he has to cook and how the place needs to hire another. Very unprofessional. No AC and no where really to sit other than bar stools along the window. Good for takeout only really but again be wary of the soggy fries and stick to the wings."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and the service is also very good. The employees are very kind and hard working as well"}
{"text":"I am so thankful for these guys deciding to move in across the street from my home. You already have a favorite flavor you just haven't found it yet 150+ wing flavors!!! They also have a full menu with hoagies, gyros, pizza, burgers and appetizers. It takes a while to cook up the food but that's a given, you can't rush quality. The guys inside are cool, loud and rowdy jokesters. Always a feel good conversation while waiting inside for your food."}
{"text":"Awesome Wings and Sauces, best in the Burgh for sure. A little pricey for the wings, but the sauces make up for that! Sandwiches are excellent and made fresh! Can't go wrong here!! 

I had the Soldier, grilled chicken and Swiss, and wings with Uncle Nicks, the talk of Beaver Falls, and the a walk of a Beaver Falls and they are some of the most flavorful sauces I have had. And I've had a lot!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here last night and was very pleased. The wing sauces can be overwhelming because there are so many!! I was surprised to see how vast their menu was with burgers, hoagies, and other items. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Cash only place. First time got 12 wings frank sinatra and eye of the tiger. These wings are delicious. Bacon ranch cheese fries right amount of crunch and softness. The big aristotle, omg amazing!! Grilled cheese bun and a huge hamburger in between, what's not to love? If you decide to get this hamburger just get that, way too filling to even eat anything else.  Lol
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If I could I wouldn't give it a star. Wings and fries were soaked in grease. I order mild wings and it wasn't sauce it was just plain water and grease and the feta where water down foggy and disgusting never again!!!! Like it was waste of my money. And they weren't cheap!!!!!  I had to wash down the grease."}
{"text":"I'll start with the wings, they were great.  Lots and lots of flavors.  The service on the other hand was atrocious.  I tried,  probably 10 times over the phone, to explain my order to the cashier.  Two orders of wings and a side of fries.  What I got was one order of wings on a bed of fries.  The worst part of the experience was while I'm waiting for the manager to fix the order, the cashier disappeared to get another customer a cup of mayo.  He then returns with the cup of mayo and mayo all over the side of his mouth!!!  .  This was the second time i was here and the first time was not much better."}
{"text":"Love these wings!!! OMG over 150 types of sauce!!!! Three Rivers is my favorite and anything with the black magic seasoning is great!!"}
{"text":"I Found yet Another Favorite Wing Place. I got \"THE WALK OF BEAVER FALLS\"  wings... Sooooooo much flavor, done on time and reasonable price. Just enough HOT and flavor mixed. Can't wait to try other flavors.
I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the worst place i have ever experienced! Our wings were ice cold when delivered as well as fries! Will be the last time we EVER order from here. Also very late....and would not answer the phone when we kept calling to see where our order was..."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings around! Checked it out on a suggestion from a friend, and definitely will be going back! The staff was nice, and provided good service."}
{"text":"Awesome wings.  Great Crew. Really enjoyed the dry Cajun extra crisp.  My boys loved the wet barbecue and the Steel City.  Looking forward to my next trip back."}
{"text":"Like the wings, and like that they are close and do delivery as well. Tried wings from Bob's a couple of months ago and they were just OK. ( did a very large order tho) Tried again more recently and got the house special flavor, (Bob's Original?) and they were darn good ! Everything else is also good, nothing outstanding but then what can you do with wings? I've seldom had truly bad wings, just some are better than others.  (I like wings)
a general coment....
Wings here in western PA seem a bit expensive and a little on the small side , usually about a buck each + or-  and BOBs prices are about the same as anywhere around,. 
Just wings are generally more expensive here than what I am used to,  that's OK tho. . . eating out here is generally less expensive.  especially breakfast. Go Figure!"}
{"text":"Best wings in the Burgh. Black Opts are always a big hit when we take them to parties."}
{"text":"From an Oklahoma gal, these wings are amazing. I had the black and gold wings and the Napoleon Garlic. The Black and Gold are quite possibly the best wings I've ever not grilled myself - deep fried perfection, dipped in some crazy bbq sauce and rolled in a delicious cayenne mix dry seasoning. 
The Napoleon Garlic were too plain for me, but a totally traditional garlic flavor if you're into that. 

I wish I could have tried more. 150 flavors is INSANE. The staff was super chill and had great suggestions. 

If I ever come back to Pittsburgh, I'm coming here first thing."}
{"text":"After hearing how awesome these wings are from some colleagues, it was definitely worth a try! Sauces and wings were very good and they even put slots in the box for the fries so they didn't get mushy. Will absolutely order again!"}
{"text":"I don't know if these guys are from Hogwarts or what, but there is some sort of sorcery going on with these wings. They are straight up magical. Best wings I've ever had in my life. It might take a couple hours to decide on a flavor since there are a million (I'd start with the talk of beaver falls). I'm going to try as many flavors as possible. Totally recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The House of 150 flavors of wings.  Yes they have hoagies, gyros, burgers, and pizza but they are known for their wings.
Nice new addition to Carnegie some good wings.
Friendly service.  When I ordered they mentioned it takes about 20 minutes to cook the wings.
We split the Pigeon wings and the Black Magic.  All, very good and crispy.  Pick a flavor to try and get your favorite.  Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Two strikes, they are out. 

I read the reviews, sounded good. First time, was told wings would be 25 minutes, got there on time to wait another twenty. This was about a month ago, so I don't recall anything outstanding or terrible the first time.

Second time...30 minutes, on time, got home, wings were seriously undercooked. 

There is nothing worse than undercooked rubbery wings. $14 for 13 wings, 11 of which were not the cobettes. 

Never again!"}
