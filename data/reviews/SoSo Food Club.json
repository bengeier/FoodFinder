{"text":"If you like being trendy and a hipster or like to pretend you are in LA, this place is for you. Pink and sea foam all around. Portions are tiny. Flavour is decent if you like Sichuan flavours. If not, stay away. Tried the ma po tofu. I'm Taiwanese so this doesn't satisfy. The Dan Dan noodles have a lot of peanut flavours, which I don't personally like. 

Many mistakes by the kitchen + slow service. Can give this up to new restaurant struggles. 

Takeout boxes also leek oil easy. 

Looks like ppl are buying in though. Good luck."}
{"text":"When I heard that some people eat pickle and peanut butter sandwiches I was like maybe it's just one of those weird yet amazing combos I'm not going to judge without trying, sort of like this new restaurant on Dundas with neon South Beach Miami decor, Long Beach California cookout music, strong cocktails that go down smoother than the Aussie bartender's perfectly flat-ironed mane, and rebellious iterations of Chinese food that would make your Taiwanese friend's mom a little bit mad (but secretly impressed) like how the heck did they get that fried taro in the buddha basket so dim-sum perfect, or what kitchen contraption was responsible for that al-dente cauliflower with delicate charcoal grill flavour, and then you blow your own mind when you realize this is precisely why people should be able to immigrate freely so FUCK DONALD TRUMP and his saltine-cracker ass wow that got dark really fast."}
{"text":"This is a new Chinese/fusion restaurant located in the Dundas/Ossington strip.  I loved the colour scheme of pastel pinks and seaform green.  The front of the restaurant (where we were seated) is bright with big windows facing onto the busy Dundas strip.  Further back, the restaurant seems to have a totally different vibe decked out with minimal lighting and a clublike feel.  The washrooms looked like a dirty club from the 60's with just stalls and a communal sink and seating area.

Upon arriving at the restaurant and alerting the hostess that we had a reservation, they weren't able to find it in their system.  After some back and forth and going through my phone, I showed them the confirmation email.  The hostess kept looking and realized that the reservation was received but they had failed to assign us a table.  They sat us about 5 mins later but was not the most pleasant way to start the dining experience.  The service continued to be amiss the rest of the night.

It took a while for someone to greet us at our table or bring water to the point where we called another service over to get us some water.  The menu is broken up into sections such as appetizers, mains and sides.  We definitely over ordered.  I liked the veggie dumplings, dan dan noodles and the rice cakes were unbelievable.  I found some of the dishes too spicy and was disappointed that spice levels could not be adjusted due to their commitment to keep food authentic (kinda ironic considering the club feel is not so authentic).  

I had asked around 9:30pm if I could close the window that I was sitting against because it was windy and was told they like to keep the party vibe going ... Once we got the bill, we noticed the price on the bill and on the credit card terminal were different (terminal showed $10 more).  I assume it was an honest mistake but we very easily could not have noticed.  The waiter had to get another person to override it and while I do believe it was a mistake, they didn't feel too bad.

Safe to say that while some of the dishes were interesting, I would not come back."}
{"text":"Vibe is pretty unique for Toronto, there's not a lot of places like this. The food is pretty on point for someone who grew up in China."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual dinner with great vibe and high quality food. Dan Dan noodles and the vegetarian dumplings were highlights. Half price wine bottle Wednesday's are amazing too and I'll definitely be back for that! Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"Tried to call in to make a reservation on a Thursday evening but they were full so we tried walking i around 7pm. We put our name town for a seat at the bar since there wasn't going to be table available till at least 9pm. The hostess told us they would text us in about 30 minutes once seats became available. It was well over 30 minutes and we didn't get a text back so we decided to go back and see if they had anything open up and luckily when we got there they had two seats available.

The place was really nicely decorated and had a really cool vibe. I believe after a certain time it becomes more like a lounge with a live DJ. It's a really cool and hip looking place. 

We got seated right away and was greeted by the server at the bar. The service was very speedy I have to say. The food came out right after we ordered it. 

We ordered 3 dishes to share:

New Year Rice Cakes - The only dish I liked of the 3 we ordered. The flavour was very much like the traditional asian rice cakes. They gave a lot of the veggies - mushrooms, asparagus and black fungus. Really good flavours and it wasn't too salty. Would highly recommend this dish. 

Dong Po Pork - I was expecting a lot more from this dish. The pork was very tender and fall apart soft, but the flavour didn't seem to really be braised into the meat. It tasted a little bland in my opinion and just didn't really wow me. 

Mouth Watering Chicken - So salty and spicy. The sauce was too sweet and salty, it need some sort of vinegar or sour element to cut it a bit. The flavour just wasn't what I was expecting for a Sichuan style chicken. The peanuts added on top didn't do a whole lot for it. 

Overall the ambiance is really cool maybe for drinks and music, but the food is definitely lacking a bit for me. The noodles seem like a hit but the other mains are just not as good as I expected. It didn't quite have the right Asian flavours in my opinion. Overall food is so-so."}
{"text":"Went tonight for the first time because it's one of the only Chinese places in my neighbourhood. The food is very flavourful and doesn't hold back. Many traditional dishes have been updated and add interesting layers. 

The space is pretty fun with its decor and seems to have a good crowd on the night I went."}
{"text":"The one stop dinner and dancing spot you didn't know you needed until SoSo came along. Full of vibes c/o some fancy lighting + perfect foliage. 

Came here with a bunch of friends looking to dance on a Saturday night and it hit the spot. Nicely sized dance floor and enough tables at the front to chill. 

Their aim is to feature acts/DJs across genres so you can expect diverse music on any night. 

Can't wait to go back and eat."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place before it opened and after looking it up, I immediately fell in love with their website. A little strange, but it's cute, funny, and drop-dead gorgeous. Once they finally opened I had to check it out.

My friend and I were the first customers to walk in, but they were still setting up so my first instinct was to run out. I didn't. We were greeted by the host and were seated by the window. At this point I was screaming (on the inside) because of how much I loved  the interior design. Everything from the tiny teal tables to the pale pink chopsticks was clearly given a lot of thought. Kudos to them.

We decided to go for the Chinese Hamburger to start because duck rolls and pork buns were unfortunately unavailable. For mains, my friend ordered the Dan Dan Noodles and I ordered Mama Chen's Mapo Tofu along with a Sweet Peach cocktail. The cocktail was very refreshing and the perfect amount of sweetness. My friend's noodles came out, but we saw that there was peanuts in it (they're allergic), so we had to send it back and got the New Year Rice Cakes instead. Peanuts weren't listed on the menu, but the server assured me they would be putting it on there in the future. Then came my mapo tofu that was incredibly flavourful! Be careful of possible peppercorns though cause I bit into one and immediately went into shock; luckily there was only one. The chinese hamburger--more like a flaky pupusa--was pretty good, but I wouldn't get it again. Lastly, the New Year Rice Cakes arrived and it was also very good! The rice cakes were bouncy yet soft and the sauce was full of umami flavour. My only complaint would be that you only receive one stalk of asparagus cut into three in the entire dish haha...

Also, make sure to check out the ominous washrooms downstairs for a simulated acid-trip

TL;DR good stuff, bring a camera for cute pics and watch out for peppercorns in ya food."}
{"text":"I read about SoSo opening on BlogTo and was excited for this new restaurant. The restaurant is pretty much located off of Dundas/Ossington intersection, look for teal exterior. As a noodle lover, I was super excited to hear about a new Chinese restaurant/bar/event venue serving Dandan noodles and visited this Friday. The interior design here gives very retro vibes and I was loving the music and decor. We had two dishes - Lamb Biang Biang noodles and the Dandan noodles. For starters, both noodles have spice in them so please be advised! Nonetheless, both dishes were enjoyable. I loved that the noodles were al dente and flavourful. Out of the two, I think I liked the Dandan better. The portions are good as well. I look forward to coming back to try other dishes as we were told some items weren't available for the night. Service was also good which made the experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have always been skeptical going anywhere \"Chinese inspired\" but was pleasantly surprised! 

What hooked me in was the Hong Kong traditional pawn shop signage. The interior itself was nice but could be better executed. I recommend trying to get seats at the bar or towards the storefront. It did however remind my of HAPPY PARADISE in Hong Kong (which I learnt was their inspiration when I spoke to the owner)

I had the Mamahuhu as my first drink. It is mildly sweet drink, and quite complex. It is also very fragrant, very stimulating. Better Days and Mellenium Mambo we're also well executed. Mambo has a kick to it but if you enjoy something mild and somewhat like a martini you would enjoy better days.

We had the biang biang noodles to share. I was not sure what to expect and I was really impressed with the flavour and texture. The spinach twist to the traditional noodles surprisingly retained texture expected from traditional plain noodles. The spice level was toned down but still fragrant. I would definitely recommend trying this dish if you enjoy a little kick.

We went on a Sunday night and traffic was quiet. The bartenders were friendly and polite and were great company."}
{"text":"Felt like dining with the brainchild of Blade Runner's art direction. Like a nice Pinterest board with neon red and pink hues that make small details -- like reading your menu awash in pink light -- feel like a technicolor day dream. Beautiful decor. The music was a bit loud and so was everyone eating, which is a sign of a great place, but also means it may not be great for intimate meetings or dates.

The food and drinks were all stellar. The presentation was great, and the taste and flavor felt distinctly original, despite many items being common fare among Chinese restaurants. I was with a large group and had a few bites of various dishes and each item was impressively flavorful.

Our server Chelsea was kind, fast, and helpful throughout the night. She was incredibly thorough when splitting the check, which is probably a hassle for her, but there was no sense of her being rushed or unhelpful.

The combination of decor, delicious food and drink, and friendly servers like Chelsea make this place great. I hope it stays in business and becomes a hallmark of the neighborhood's great offerings."}
