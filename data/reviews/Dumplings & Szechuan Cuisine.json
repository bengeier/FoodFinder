{"text":"Really good Szechuan food.  We had traditional noodle which was spicy and clearly had real Szechuan peppercorns, cold spicy cucumber,  Dan Dan noodle,  dumplings,  crispy pancake and spicy chicken with black beans (not that spicy though)  all were very good and the traditional noodle was great.   Would definitely come here again to try more dishes.   Service was very good, friendly and polite."}
{"text":"The dumpling wrappers are a bit thick, but the food is all really tasty, especially the chef special beef!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out the Chinese smoked duck, well I blamed the picture on the menu looked too tempting. Please please please change a proper picture for the smoked duck on the menu if you could because to be honest these are two ridiculously different dishes."}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal here.  It was our first time and we ordered the chef's pork rib special, hot and sour soup, and dumplings.  It was very spicy, but had layers of flavour.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Alright! Another new Szechuan restaurant! This restaurant just opened a month ago, so it is packed with people who wants to try them out. Luckily we got the last empty table after we arrived at12:30, the line got very long after us. There's around 15 tables in the restaurant, it is very clean since it is still new. The wait staff are very friendly and attentive,  they worked fast but there were still a bit of wait  for them to come back to our table, was really busy. Food came within a reasonable time. The menu has a very good selection of dishes, wish some that aren't spicy.  The Vermicelli in chili oil has always been my fave dish in Szechuan cuisine, love the sour and spicy taste,the one here is pretty good, it is not garnished as nicely like some other places but it was still very tasty.  All the food we had were great except for the boiling fish, it was spicy, but nothing stood out, was not even aromatic. If you are looking for good boiling fish in chili oil, go to The Old House! Hands down the best boiling fish! G Yes, i would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is exactly what it says it is, and offers those two specialties, it is pretty good especially if your in the warden area where there isn't a lot of szechuan cuisine, it is a small cosy family run business, and as such is pretty blue collar. this restaurant is for family and friends and not really the fancy places you go, but it gives you a relatively good food, for its price. i would not order anything that is not szechuan or dumpling oriented on the menu, since those items are not their specialty they are not really that great. but everything that is within their namesake is pretty authentic. i would recommend to those in the area who just want some szechuan food and don't want to travel"}
{"text":"I didn't know why we were there. Both of us cannot handle too spicy and numbing food, but we were craving for it?  We were there around 9, and ordered the pot of beef & bamboo shoots; signature spicy pork ribs, and fresh fish fillets (bone-in) in hot soup, homemade toufu with oyster mushroom and vegs.  Most dishes are flavorful and spicy! Homemade toufu tasted really good.  Beef briskets and pork ribs are rough, you can tell that they are cheap cuts.  For Signature fish dishes, you better order the fresh fish (bone-in), which is around $20, or they use the frozen basa fish fillets and those dishes are cheaper.  The problem we have is the LONG WAITING.   And the young waiters had been wiping and cleaning the floor, rolling up the rubber rug right next to us through the entire meal. They didn't refill our glass unless we called them(cool water is essential for Szechuan restaurant you know)  Manager is polite but they definitely need to increase the kitchen staff and proper training for service staff.  Will return if I see more positive reviews here."}

{"text":"Great little spot where we enjoyed many small plates of delicious pork dumplings and noodles from the dim sum page. Quick friendly service from the young man who made some good recommendations. Cant wait to return to try more dishes, I think at least 10 more visits are in order to sample enough selections. Faves included the homemade spicy dumplings at 6 for $3.99 and the dan dan noodles ($3.99 for the small) that were sweet and numbing on the tongue, make sure you ask for a big side of chili oil! Shoutout to yelp for helping me discover this place.  Bill total for 2 was $32 with soft drinks and tax, we walked out stuffed with a doggy bag of 10 big dumplings. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Pros: Hand made dumplings Friendly service  Cons: Soup filled dumplings were a little disappointing  I noticed this place when I came into the same plaza for hot pot one afternoon.  As a big fan of dumplings I had to give this place a try.  This place is on the smaller side but they do manage to fit in as many seats as possible.  It's a very busy place frequented by the local Chinese community.  Turnover is pretty quick so you won't be waiting too long for a seat.  We ordered a pork and fennel dumpling, a soup filled dumpling, dan dan noodles, spicy won tons and a fired noodle for our little one.  The prices here are very good for the portions you get.  Overall, it's very competitive with some of the other good dumpling restaurants.  The dumplings here are hand made as far as I can tell.  The wrappers are much thinker than I'm used to, but they were still very well made.  The dan dan noodles and spicy won tons each had their own take on the dish. Usually, these dishes have a more sesame/peanut taste to it.  Their rendition is a sweeter/spicy take but it was good nonetheless.  The soup filled dumplings (xiao long bao) was the only item not up to par in my opinion. They didn't have any soup in them when you bite in at all. They also didn't feel hand made at all.  Soup filled dumplings are one of my favs so it kinda sucked that they weren't as good as everything else here.    The service here is pretty good considering English is not the main language spoken.  Still, the servers speak enough English and all the menus have English for every item so you will not have a tough time at all if you don't speak Chinese.  This is a great little dumpling place overall.  If you're a fan and are in the area, give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Always  Have good food here, very satisfying szechuan cuisine, price is reasonable, service is fair,we ordered A spicy pot and 3 of us couldn't finish it ,have to take home half of it, every time we crave for szechuan food we think of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time since it was nearby. Pretty average tasting food in my opinion. The beef noodle soup was somewhat bland. Nothing else stood out and the prices were in line with the quality of the food. I'm pretty sure they run the frozen dumpling shop next door. Are we eating previously frozen dumplings? Hard to say. I'll probably come back one day to try a different selection of dumplings since it's so close."}
{"text":"So Spicy and So Good.  Dumplings and Szechuan Cuisines has this family vibe I really enjoy. The menu is extensive with a mixture of spicy and non spicy food.  We were here for lunch with a toddler. The waitstaff was so kind and accommodating. Warm water in a plastic cup and cute bowl/spoon were provided without asking. +0.5 star.  Since we are still training the toddler to enjoy spicy food, we ended up ordering a Pork and Veggie Dumplings just for him.  Spicy Cold Chicken and Hot and Sour Intestine Noodle were both delicious and have great complex flavours aside just being numbing spicy.  And of course I will be back to have more noodle dish! They do have smaller size at $3.99 and $5.99 for large for some of their noodle item, perfect for single diner like myself!  10% off Grand Opening Special if pay by cash."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  The order was some dumplings, egglant dish, and dry chicken and chili.    The dumplings I could have bought at any chinese supermarket in Scarborough.   The dry chicken and chili was 99% chili .9999% batter and if there was any chicken I couldn't find it.    Oh, that eggplant dish?   Never got it.    Despite asking twice.  Like HL said, the pictures on a menu look good, but the food stinks.    Additionally (and this ought never happen at a Chinese establishment), the tea was cold and basically water.   1 tea bag in a large pot.   I've unfortunately found some terrible Chinese joints in Scarborough, but at least the others had good tea!   Will never, ever go again, you have too much competition and I'll try them."}
{"text":"Went all the way to Scarborough for this highly reviewed Szechuan restaurant! Such a little hidden gem!   Very authentic Szechuan cuisine!"}
