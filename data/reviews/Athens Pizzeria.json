{"text":"Pizza be on 10 bruh. Its my fav. Hella cheesy. And they garlic bread with cheese is da bomb"}
{"text":"Athens has the best pizza around! We eat there several times a week. Nice fresh salads and cold subs. Amazing wings! We've even had the fish dinner and shrimp dinner and they were good. The staff is just awesome. Very friendly and every order is right. Great delivery as well."}
{"text":"They changed a lot recently. The last few times I had it, it was horrible and I loved this place. But they still have the best meatball subs in town that hasn't changed."}
{"text":"We live across the street and around the corner from Athens. We've been ordering from them for almost 17 years--since we moved into the neighborhood. They have great pizza--we've tried all of them, great sandwiches and salads too. They do great dinners--fish, shrimp, chicken parm, etc. They also have such friendly staff! From the counter staff to delivery, they are just so nice!

The folks at Athen's truly are a part of this neighborhood! They care about the folks who live here and what goes on. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great price! Great service! Excellent pizza. The dilevery man was so nice and cheerful. Ill defiantly be ordering again!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Pizza in the west park area,and the Greek salad Wow fantastic ! I'm so glad you are on my way home from work,you have done a great job,the pizza is so fresh salad too and the pizza sauce is out of this world  good.  Keep up the good work,I was not given a free coupon to post this. just thought I'd put this out there!"}
{"text":"Some may argue there is better pizza in West Park, but I disagree! Great value, great service and they earn their best pizza awards!"}
{"text":"So I am a big fan of Athens! I order personally, but we also order a lot from the school I teach at. This past weekend I placed an order for 3 sheet pizzas, and I had to call back and order 3 more. They were delivered without issue. I was amazed at how friendly and accommodating everyone was despite my large, and rather short notice of an order. Bravo Athens!!!"}
{"text":"Best traditional pizza shop in Cleveland area hands down!  Their pizza sauce makes the difference and separates Athen's from all the rest.

My family drives across town 20-30 minutes just for pizza every week.

Nick, the owner, is great!  Super customer service."}
{"text":"I would have given 3 stars because my calzone was decent (though in the future id have them skip the chopped up deli ham) but the garlic Parmesan wings had no flavor and when the delivery guy came, he just sat in his car and laid on the horn until I walked to his car to get my food. Then he sifted what looked like a hoarders stash of receipts to end up just asking me what I ordered. It was the most awkward delivery I've ever experienced. That guy is beyond his delivery boy days. I'll probably get the calzone again in the future but next time I'll just go pick it up..."}
{"text":"Eating dinner out with a baby can be a bit of a chore, and traveling just complicates things.  After eating at the hotel restaurant last night, we decided to order in pizza.  After checking out some of the local restaurants on Yelp, I settled on an Athenian (or Greek-inspired) Pizza from Athens Pizza.  After placing my order, I was sad when I realized that the large was only 12 inches in diameter.  That's usually a pretty small pizza for us to split.  However, when they delivered the pizza, it was definitely worth it.  The cheese was extremely thick and they didn't skimp on the other toppings either.  The gyro meat tasted authentic and the \"cucumber sauce\" was the perfect tzatziki compliment.  Extremely filling overall and left no one hungry.
My wife has a long-standing tradition of leaving a slice or two left over for breakfast the next morning.  Not tonight.  She simply could not help herself."}
{"text":"Completely love this place!!! Definitely a small family run operation with ties to the Westpark neighborhood. The calzones are my favorite and serve dinner that night and lunch the next day!!! The pizza is great and it pairs well with the anti pasta salad."}
{"text":"They have a decent midwestern pizza.  Nothing life changing.... Good crust, fresh toppings, and very light sauce (maybe too light).  The place was clean and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town since Jimmy's Pizza closed. My only complaint is that they don't deliver to Fairview."}
{"text":"I grew up eating this pizza, every Friday for years it was and always is Athens! I've never been dissatisfied! Always fresh pizza and the sauce and crust is unlike any other! The only con I'd have is you can't dine-in. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but don't let looks fool you -- the food & staff are AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, recommended by a family member since I am from Cincinnati.
As good as Giovanni's in Lorain with a thinner crust which is my preference.
Excellent, took 4 back to Cincinnati."}
{"text":"I have been going here since it opened across the street from where they are now.  The best pizza I have had in my 66 yrs.  I no longer live in the delivery area but will make the trip to get this pizza every time.  They don't skimp on the toppings, you get plenty.  Never had to ask for extra cheese because they actually put a lot on it.   Don't know what that so called chef T.C. had but must have been a bad day.  I have never gotten a bad pizza from them.  Trust me when I say, you will love it."}
{"text":"It's taken me a long time to warm up to Athens Pizza. I've had their pizza a few times before and thought it was ok.  They are the winner of the West Park pizza bake off. Some of their specialty pizzas do seem good if you're a meat eater, but I'm not.  However, when I got their veggie pizza recently, I was amazed at how many veggies they put on there!  It was LOADED.  Tons of crisp peppers, olives, onions, and tomatoes.  I could barely see the cheese.  It certainly made me feel better about eating an extra slice since there were so many veggies. As long as they keep throwing on the veggies, I'll be ordering pizza on lazy dinner nights."}
{"text":"Athens makes great pizza, Stromboli and subs. Their sauce is to die for, the dough is great. My favorite is for sure their Stromboli. There is plenty of cheese and filling, the dough is thin, but not too thin, and the dipping sauce is amazing!!! Please try Athens and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok, I am going to get right to the point with this review.  This was the best pizza that I have had in a long time, by far.  They stack the pie with toppings that are literally falling off of the pizza. I could not make up my mind what pizza I wanted so I decided to go with a small Athenian Pizza, and a small Pig Out Pizza. I must say that was a good choice because they were both delicious. The flavor, texture, consistency, amount of toppings... MMMMMMMM! WOOOOOOWWW!

Some things to keep in mind for first timers is that they do not have a dine-in option. They only have carry out or delivery.  For carry out orders, you can call your order ahead or make it only line, which will save you a lot of time. They have ample parking in front of the restaurant. And be sure to check and double check your order before you leave.

I would have gave them 5 stars, but I did not get the fries I ordered and paid for with the pizza. I got a brown paper bag when I picked up my pizzas.  I assumed the fries were in the bag.  However, it ended up being the cumber sauces for my Athenian Pizza."}
{"text":"I drive my mother & kids over to a family members house every other week, sometimes two times a week to eat their pizza !"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite pizza place. The place offers a lot more than just pizza. There is fish, shrimp and pastas. So far we haven't had anything we haven't like. Delivery is quick and the food is still warm."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the West side. Prices are very reasonable. Owner and staff are friendly. Would love for them to expand into bigger space for sit down! We're lucky to be so close."}
{"text":"You, Athens, are the best pizza in West Park. I did have to cheat on you and try all the other pizza in West Park, but now I know for sure, you are the best. I am ending any wandering ways. Every Friday pizza night from now on, its just you. (Now what is yet to be determined is if you have the best gyro, that is a close call, but you hold your own in this category too ;)"}
{"text":"I went to Athens Pizza on 88th in Denison Ave as it was listed in the NEO Pizza Contest and was in the top 15.

Ordered a large pepperoni, thick crust with fresh mushrooms,  

After a long wait the pizza came out looked anemic on top, the pepperoni not cooked and canned mushrooms on the pizza.

Additionally, the pizza was made with a pre-made shell, when getting near the crust  it was doughy like a loaf of bread, the layered shell came a part. I am a chef, so I was clearly aware of what I was eating.

Save a trip to the Hood, and head father west to Dante's Pizza on Rocky River Drive in Cleveland, or head into Lakewood for an Angelo's Pizza. Both are better and were also in the top 15 NEO Pizza Contest, the difference is, they belong in the top 15...."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting pizza!  I had some of their square cut pizza at a catered event, and it was truly great.  Nice, thick 'sicilian' type slices, with aromatic tomato sauce and fresh tasting cheese.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Jeev's word choice....Athens has a decent pizza. Pretty greasy and doughy, so it's not my #1 choice as a NY style pizza addict. It's decent otherwise though, and the breadsticks are also actually really good. Quick, pleasant service and apparently they deliver!"}
{"text":"Delivery was faster than promised, the driver was personable, and bothered the pizza and side of meatballs were both great!  Don't think Greek pizza, think great, fresh pizza!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a double double and it's probably the best pizza I've had in a long time.  Lots of flavor from the sauce and the cheese tastes better than any other pizzeria.  New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the West Park Area. Tried about 5 local places. Athens pizza is head and shoulders above them all. This is a great gem of a pizzeria in Cleveland that does not get enough recognition. Do yourself a favor and give them a try. The Deluxe Pizza was amazing."}
{"text":"AMAZING pizza on the west side - second best to angelos. They use fresh toppings, crunchy crust, and greasy melted cheese. I would say it's about $$$, definitely not the cheapest around, but less expensive than angelos. If you live near kamms corner this is an absolute must to try."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza place if you live in the Kamms Corner location, can't recommend them enough."}
{"text":"Pizza was out of sight and the gentlemen who helped us was great. The pizza took me back to the days I use to eat elementary school pies and loved the flavor. We ordered the full sheet pizza which was bold because I never ordered there before. The pizza was ginormous could barely fit in the truck. Usually huge dishes lack the flavor of small dishes. This pizza was amazing! We really enjoyed the toppings cheese and sauce was substantial not stingy at all. Everyone that knows me understands I love my pizza and Italian foods. I live on the east side and would not mind traveling here again. Excellent first time experience."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time. Great pizza, salad and service. Only bad thing is they forgot my fork for salad. Would highly recommend and will order free m here in the future."}
{"text":"We just moved to the Westpark area a couple of months ago. My fiancé is from around the area and she told me we had to get Athens as our first Westpark pizza dinner. I have to say that I am going to have a love hate relationship with this place. My waistline is going to hate me as I live in about a 5 minute walk to the shop but my taste buds are going to be in love for as long as we live here.
 
The first night we ordered, we got a \"large\" Double Double (extra cheese, extra pepperoni) and an order of the garlic parmesan wings. The pizza is literally exactly how I want a pizza. The crust is crispy and chewy in true \"pan style\", the sauce is not over powering and the cheese (even on a normally cheesed) is perfect. The toppings are fresh and plentiful. The wings were good but not great. It's nice that they offer more than just pizza and have salads, appetizers (cheesy bread is small but delicious), Italian dinners and sandwiches.
 
My only gripe is they aren't open on Sundays. We have probably ordered Athens every other week since we moved in. The shop itself is kind of an eyesore but the staff working is friendly and they always deliver a good pie. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. excellent service.

It's easy to see why Athens wins so many awards and why they've been a popular spot in West Park for years. The pizza is always PACKED with toppings and is done to a perfect crispness. The crust is chewy and authentic and I love the sauce. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"Athens Pizzeria now has online ordering! And, fried mushrooms! My life is complete. ( Okay, I don't get out much.) However, when I order delivery, they are quick and the wings are still crisp. How do they do that? When I ask for my pizza well done, that's how I get it. And.... Wait for it-- the delivery people are fast and nice!! You know, I'm moving to a new apartment and I want to stay in the area so I don't have to find a new pizza place. Thanks Athens!!"}
{"text":"The drive from the airport to my house via Rocky River drive is interesting to say the least. Car rental area, projects, abandoned storefronts, and overall misery give way to a nicer old neighborhood once you cross Puritas. This unassuming pizza shop sits between there and Kamm's Koroners. I am drawn to places with names like \"Athens\" or \"Etruscan Emperor\" as they offer some aura of Mediterranean splendor. It's only a storefront pick up joint, so the decor is pretty plain. They do have some generic \"starving artists\" paintings of Greek villages and baseball trophies on display. Apparently, they beat the Indians a few times.

Pretty extensive menu for such a small place. I ordered the 8 cut \"Athenian\" pizza which is gyro themed(onion, tomato, white sauce). I left the meat out which makes me a hippie douche. They did include the yogurt sauce on the side. This was good for dipping the fried mushrooms in. I can't replicate that gyro sauce at home to save my life. Love that stuff. Also got an order of cheesy breadsticks. Total was 20. All was filling, and the service was friendly.

I got to wait for my order sitting on my car while watching all the planes fly overhead to land at Hopkins. Not as close to the ground as that scene in Wayne's World, but close enough to get a kick out of it."}
{"text":"Was staying at a hotel near the Cleveland airport and had already returned my rental car, so I was looking for somewhere that delivered. Athens seemed to have good reviews, and I always prefer ordering from independent pizzerias as opposed to chains, so I gave them a shot. It was fantastic, I really enjoyed it, just the right amount of toppings, great crust, tasty sauce. If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely look at ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch before a flight out. I tried the chicken parm sandwich and cheese pizza. Both were good but nothing special. Very good prices though."}
