{"text":"I first discovered Mitsuki when they were a little hole in the wall in Longueuil.  I am very glad they've grown and expanded to different locations. Love the all you can eat concept.  Food is delicious, the place is very clean and the service is quick and courteous as always."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant before, usually the food is normally good, but the service was very poor this time around. The waiter asked me for more tip because I didn't give \"their\" minimum amount even though I had paid for three people. I refused to give more tip and the manager came over to our table and insulted me for being \"cheap\". I'm sorry but a tip is a bonus and a personal donation for a service. If you desire a minimum tip for your employees, increase their salary."}
{"text":"Good all you can eat sushi with lots of different menu items. Bring your own wine is always a good thing and the service is pretty fast but they don't always bring what you ordered. My only complaint is they don't take reservation before 8pm on the weekends. Also, the place is pretty small but the decor is really nice."}
{"text":"Not worth the price you pay and they have to argue with you which table you want when the place is almost empty - this happened to my family couple of times and we saw they did it to the other customers too. We won't go back. No point to spend your money to torture yourself and the food is really nothing exciting!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! The service was terrible. Waiter was extremely rude. My family went to the restaurant for lunch. When we got there, the waiter warned us that the kitchen would close in an hour. Therefore, we have decided to order more so we do not need to reorder when the kitchen would be closed. The waiter looked at our order and refused to serve us because he said we ordered too much (i thought this restaurant is all you can eat?). We have insisted that we will be able to finish everything. But the waiter threatened us that he will be counting each piece that we would not finish and charge us $1 per piece that is left. Without surprise, they have reduced the amount we have ordered. When we were done, we have waved to the waiter several times for the bill. He pretended that he did not see us. We had to walk towards him at the counter to tell him that we are ready to pay. However, he has served every other table in the restaurant before handing us the bill. When we got the bill, we were the last table left in the restaurant. I had a feeling that the waiter was doing this to piss us off. The other people who posted 5-star reviews are clearly people who work at the restaurant. Very biased reviews. 

I do not recommend anyone going there..."}
{"text":"Le sushi à volonté est toujours un concept intéressant, donc ça nous a donné envie d'y arrêter afin de couper la route vers Montreal.

Nous n'avons pas été déçus, les sushis étaient bons et le saké aussi. Nous avons beaucoup aimé les kamikazes et les crevettes tempura!

Sinon le service est typique d'un à volonté... Une vitesse moyenne sans zèle ou attention particulière.

Sinon c'est situé en plein milieu des magasins dans le dix30 donc si vous vous attendez à une belle terrasse, vous n'aurez que la vue sur un parking... 

À recommander pour une fin de journée de magasinage."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place for all you can eat sushi!! They have a wide selections of food. Their grilled lamb and torched sushis are my favorite(I believe they only serve certain foods on the menus on the weekends). I just had Mitsuki yesterday and now I'm still craving for it"}
{"text":"Worst place ever...particularly there is one guy looks like sort of boss is the most disgusting one... we wanted to order some more after the first round, and he looked really pissed and threaten us to finish the first round before ordering...why you call urself All-u-can-eat...there are bones in our sashimi, and he said is perfectly ok since they are fish...wasted my money and time to have been there twice as is the closest sushi place in southshore!"}
{"text":"We visited this place on a Sunday evening. A friend recommended it to me so we decided to give it a try. The place was nicely decorated and it was packed when we arrived. The service was quite slow throughout the night. 

The food was well presented and tasted decent. As much as I want to like this place, some of the food that we ordered never came, some of the dishes were only available on Friday and Saturday and the fact that the dessert is extra really upset me. If I am going to an ALL YOU CAN EAT place, I expect the dessert to be all you can eat. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Not bad, they have the best ones and they have some other interesting takes on different types of sushis.
We went there twice, last time, we had to order a beer 3 times, with three different people and they brought us the wrong thing twice. I don't know if I'll go back, it is still pretty pricey."}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat sushi in town, however, a bit more expensive. For friday and saturday, its 31.95$/person! But i like to to go there during the weekend because they serve lamb chop and black cod which are both very good!

They are a bit too generous on the sauce...this is one thing I dont like about some of their sushis. If not, very good! On the other hand, I have a friend who told me that the food quality changes in time. Some days its super good and some day not good..."}
{"text":"For an all you can eat, I think they have really good shrimp tempuras. It was fluffy and crunchy, delicious! I enjoyed their torched sushis but surprisingly, the dish of the night was the grilled beef ribs. Perfect sweetness and char, tender and fall off the bone. Yes the service was lukewarm but it was a busy night and it did not bother me at all. Also, one notable mention is that they did not make a single mistake on our orders, which was much appreciated."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi! Everything I've tried was delicious. 

Its a little noisy, but that's most restaurants."}
{"text":"Okay so I tried the all you can eat buffet as we were a group for an event. The positives were really nice decor, fast & efficient service and 18$ is pretty good for all you can eat.
As for the food itself well jack of all trade with everything from sweet potato fries, general Tao, sushi, dumplings, popcorn chicken... It was really a hit or miss most sushi dishes were fresh, delicious and visually appealing but some were really bad... The peanut sauce chicken had oil floating on top of a dry peanut sauce with very bland (photo speaks for itself) and dry chicken in fact I think most chicken dishes had pretty dry chicken which was multiple dishes."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi I've found in Montreal! The food is of quality and fresh (rare thing for an all you can sushi place in montreal), and the service is excellent!

I've there around 7 or 8 times and it never disappointed. Thumbs up guys, keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went there for lunch, unlimited sushis and other varieties of asian plates, it was really worth it for the price (17$). Quality of sushis was amazing they were fresh,  I strongly suggest to try the peanut butter chicken that has that perfect sweet taste. Restaurant was clean and has nice and modern decor. Really good overall experience!"}
{"text":"One of he waiters is extremely unprofessional and rude. This place has ok food, but I have never seen such unresponsive service and disgusting attitude in any other restaurant. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent, good and fast service, all you can eat sushi and meat. I recommend for you to call first to see if they can take you, because is always full."}
{"text":"Mitsuki is an AYCE sushi with alot varieties in the menu, from sashimi,nigiri,sushi pizza, maki, pad thai, skewers,etc Let say they have everything on the menu to please anybody. In my case, even if i am going to an AYCE sushi, i still expect sushi quality, not like a exclusive sushi restaurant but still a certain level of quality. This is what you get at Mitsuki. I have been there many times and the sushis a good and they change their menu from time to time, to add new item, which is nice.
My best items on the menu:
Beef sashimi
Torched salmon nigiri
Salmon sashimi
Rainbow
Kamizake
Kalbi beef

Note: the lamb skewer was too fatty and salty, not enough meat.

Overall, i enjoy every time i went there, the service is quick and during the weekend the place is packed. Be aware.

I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I've been to this place more than 5 times, and I have recommended this place to a lot of people for the good price and service. 

Although, today, I have never seen a waiter with such a disgusting attitude with his clients. Sure you manage the place, but that will NEVER allow you to lack respect to anyone PAYING for your service and your food. I came here for a peaceful and pleasant experience and got the complete opposite.

I honestly think that this place needs to learn how to treat everyone equally and never talk back when a client makes a comment on a service. I will never set foot in this restaurant ever again. I work with clients, and I also go out to restaurants a LOT and never have I ever seen this kind of attitude. 
Goodbye.
Never come here unless you want to be treated like shit."}
{"text":"I honestly really enjoyed this place. As far as AYCE sushi goes, it's certainly one of the best ones I've been to. Everything tasted very fresh and there was a nice variety of different rolls and food. Sashimi was excellent and the cuisine portions are perfect to try a bit of everything!

The price is a tad bit steeper than other similar places and this branch is not BYOB, but overall delicious and totally worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing place, freshly prepared sushi, very big variety , generous portions, the quality of the ingredients is a reflexion to what the dishes are. The stuff are very professional, they don't smile a lot but the service is exceptional , dishes kept on coming as we kept on ordering . The octopus sashimi is one the best i ever ate. Salt and pepper shrimps; gigantic. Maki are full of flavour to let you tasting buds ask for more. By far the best all you can eat sushi in the region. Highly recommend it. I give it 5 stars in its category . 4 stars among the highly rated sushi places. Real note would be 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food. Ridiculous promotion policy. 
We've been to the restaurant on Wednesday night. It was my birthday. We ordered two runs. The first run was okay. We ordered some teriyaki beef and chicken for our second run. We waited about 20min. They were totally cold at the time when they were served. We also ordered a shrimp ramen, which was way too salted. The Ubagai sashimi was not fresh. We found  two coupon. One was 10% offer and the other was a free fried ice cream or fried banana for birthday. The promotion policy was first, can use only one coupon at a time (Okay, understood, which is normal); second, the offer can be refused during the month of December. Okay, I was born in December. The service was not good. We had to keep asking for water. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Première expérience dans ce resto all you can eat. C'était bien mais ce n'est définitivement pas mon préféré. C'est quelques dollars de plus que les autres à volonté des environs et ce n'est pas un BYOW. Le décor est beau mais les tables sont beaucoup trop petites et beaucoup trop proches une de l'autre. Le service était correct, un peu froid comme dans la plupart des restos de sushis à volonté. Le Menu est très bien, en plus des sushis il y a vraiment beaucoup d'autres choix et tout ce que nous avons goûté était très bon."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night. What separates this place from other all you can eat is the selection of cooked food. I particular love the lamb skewers. The choices and quality of the sushi and sashimi is on par with all the other establishments in Brossard and Montreal. will definitely come by for another visit."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi we've had in a long time! We decided to try this place after hearing good things about it , and we were not disappointed.  The sashimi tasted fresh and the sushi was nicely made. I really liked their lamb brochettes as well! They have a good variety of different sushi/small plates to choose from. This place does fill up quickly , so be sure to reserve ! The only downside is that the price is a bit higher than other sushi places, but well worth the price! We cannot wait to go again :)"}
{"text":"I went on a week day during the day and it was not crowded at all! Inside is a cozy decor, agreeable and not too bright. The food is well done and I ate way too much. The menu is not as big and as fancy as the other sushi buffets, but it's good quality! The servers were polite and kind, very quiet I must say!"}
{"text":"We had a good dinner here. Service is good and responsive. The food is good and fresh (for a buffet restaurant). They have a lot of options to choose from. One star off because of the price, which is higher than other sushi buffets even in Montreal downtown."}
