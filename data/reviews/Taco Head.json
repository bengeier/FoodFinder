{"text":"I had a steak taco on a corn tortilla and this was hands down, one of the best tacos I've ever had! Juan, the owner was awesome and super friendly! If you ever find yourself in the Peoria area, don't leave without stopping at Taco Head!"}
{"text":"Taco Head catered a party I attended, and the food was so good that I took a plate to go!"}
{"text":"This mobile taco cart is amazing! Taco Tuesday has 4 tacos $5 and it's an absolute steal!! Grab yourself some carne asada tacos loaded up with everything and you won't be disappointed. It's got a great balance of heat, flavor and so much more.

Just another example of a great guy putting out an amazing product and getting recognized for it. Way to go Juan!"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos were delicious!! Owner was very friendly and attentive. Convenient location and plan on returning!! Also looking forward to trying his new restaurant"}
{"text":"By far the best tacos ive had in Arizona! It packs a flavorful punch followed by a subtle hint of heat. Im most definitely coming back! Thank you Juan!"}
{"text":"Taco head catered a baby shower we had in our back yard.  Everything went flawlessly the food was amazing and everyone was really nice.. all the left overs were put in trays and we were allowed to keep everything... highly recommend if your having a party or event"}
{"text":"Great street tacos, especially the Carne asada on flour are the bomb. Very friendly service, we missed him 2x and he made it up to us. Close to home good fast grub"}
{"text":"Best street tacos ever.   If they are available buy them up!  Always fresh and taste soo good."}
{"text":"Read about it on yelp, and damn i have to say i agree.  Of course I did the 4 for $5 and i left to go back to my hotel to eat them... they didn't even last 30 seconds.  I could not resist the smell of them.  The avocado sauce is so delicious and the salsa has a little kick in it... the tortillas aren't slimy like other street tacos i've had.  

Legitimately licked my fingers and debating on going back today..."}
{"text":"Ate some tacos that came from here. Not bad. I think their Facebook page said they are working with one of those delivery services now. Good street tacos. Just doesn't seem to be open that much. Tried going a couple of times when I thought they were open but it was shut down already. Too bad."}
{"text":"This place is sooo bomb!!!! The tacos are nice and full of meat and toppings. The chicken tacos are delishhh and so flavorful!!! Def coming back for more..."}
{"text":"First timer at Taco Head and it did not dissapoint.  The tacos are fantastic and the service is great!  This will definitely be my new Taco Tuesday spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time and I will say the street tacos are freaking amazing. They were fresh as can be and the Carne Asada was cooked just right. Food is priced great and of course beers are cold and cheap. I would recommend anybody to stop by and grab some tacos. Juan kicks ass at his job. A must to stop here if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Juan catered an excellent event! I have had Taco Man/Woman at many events, Taco Head has proven to be head and shoulders above all others to date. Fresh chicken and steak piled high, bursting with flavor, on fresh warm tortillas. Savory beans and rice served along with some of the best salsa and avocado toppings. Loved the salsa, fresh and spicy with just the right amount of heat. Juan showed up early to set up and was ready ahead of schedule. He stayed until all guests were filled to their content. After everyone had full bellies, Juan left a fair amount of food behind, enough to serve several full meals. Very professional, clean and above all delicious. Would highly recommend for most any event."}
{"text":"Amazing street tacos. The meat is so juicy! The price is great and even better on taco Tuesday! I hear the salsa is good I have not tried it since I don't like spicy I also hear the guac and cole slaw are good but I have not tried those since I am allergic. Great customer service! definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I am quite upset because I have driven over there to Peoria and 97th Ave several times now on different days of the week and no one is ever there. Not sure how anyone else is finding the taco stand but I don't see anyone there. Bummer. I will have to see about a refund on Groupon"}
{"text":"Just went there with the fam for taco Tuesday and that ish was hella delicious! Juan knows how to make a taco for sure! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So I consider myself a taco aficionado. In my line of work I drive around alot and get to try out alot of diffrent places. Recently I have been told my many family and friends to try out a little taco cart out on 97th Ave and Peoria Ave. Today I had a chance to get over there and try them out. As I walked up the guy running the cart named Juan greeted me. He explained to me that today was Taco Tuesday and the special was 4 tacos for $5. It seemed to be on point with other taco joints. He had 2 types of tacos, carne asada  and chicken. I asked for 2 of each. I had everything put on it. I got my tacos and went on my way. The tacos were great! Chicken isnt usaualy offered and they were made with breast meat. I have to tell you that they were moist, tender and full of flavor. The carne asada was also very moist and full of flavor. All four tacos were packed to the top with meat and toppings. The salsa is a bit spicy but went well with each kind of taco. I was pleased with my tacoa from Taco Head. My only criticism is there are limited toppings and no real place to sit and eat. I recomend trying Taco Head out."}
{"text":"Awesome Tacos! The owner is so friendly. And the hot sauce is nice and spicy with great flavor. Will be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! I had carne and pastor, both were excellent! Juan is an awesome dude who knows how to take care of his customers!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best street tacos we have ever eaten! We had the chicken and steak loaded with all the fixings included a delicious hot salsa. The meat was cooked to perfection and very flavorful! You get 4 tacos for $5 and they will fill you up as Juan doesn't skimp on meat or toppings! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The Only thing better than the tacos, were the people behind making them.  Juan, keep doing what you do brotha and come back to Alta Paradise Food Truck night!"}
{"text":"I honestly had high hopes for this company, and it was nothing but a waste of money, time, and way more stress than I asked for. I had a bad feeling about them two weeks before the wedding when he had horrible communication and should have acted on that and did not, instead I gave him the benefit of the doubt over and over. I could have cooked our own food, spent less, and done a better job than taco head. The sad thing is I can never get this day back. I felt better thinking he was going to make it right, and now I just feel scammed and stupid for trusting this company and its owner. The sad thing is $240 isn't going to make or break us, it is the principle in the matter that he made several promises, dropped the ball, pretended to take responsibility and acted like he would make it right, and now is 100% ignoring me and blowing me off. PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THIS COMPANY FOR YOUR WEDDING I sincerely hope this does not happen to anyone else on their wedding day , and that he either takes weddings seriously moving forward, or does not do them at all.

{"text":"Went here today for lunch. I had been to the old location on 85th Ave, this was my first time at 97th and Peoria. New location, same awesome tacos. I had the carne asada with all the fixins. The meat is tender and the salsa is hot, exactly the way you want it. Juan builds the tacos fresh for you and piles them high, and keeps up a good conversation while he's at it. I'll definitely be coming back. People... eat great food and support local businesses. If you're in Peoria, go to Taco Head. If you're not... make the drive!"}
{"text":"I ate the food at a wedding I was invited to and it was extremely cold. We were the first to eat after the bridal party."}
{"text":"I found this place when Yelp said there was a 'hot new place' nearby. I usually ignore these alerts but I'm so glad I followed up on this. It was easy to find,  I went to the Peoria location. Juan is such a nice guy.  He acknowledged each customer who walked up and chatted up everyone. I went on Taco Tuesday so there was a special of 4 for $5. Winner.
I'm not a picky eater so I ordered my carne asada with everything. Juan was very easy to talk to and worked quickly, he wanted me to try to a chicken taco so that was an extra treat! 
The tacos were loaded with toppings and immediately filled my car with a delicious scent,  I couldn't get home fast enough.
I don't know what sauces he puts on the tacos but everything works. 
It's not crazy hot, it really is a perfect mix and balance.
Whenever I get a chance,  Ill go back and will definitely spread the word about these street tacos. 
Recommended."}

{"text":"Had taco head for the first time today and they were amazing! I loved both of the sauces he puts on them. He's right down the street from me n wish I found out about him a lot sooner!
