{"text":"For a delicious pita try the chicken shish kebab and don't forget the Tahini its amazing pure sesame seed paste. The owner is a bit like a soup nazi so don't be sensitive.PS bring your appetite"}
{"text":"OK for once in a while if you're in the area.

Went for my first time and they didn't have shwarma so I got shish kabob instead.  Didn't get to customize what I wanted in my pita and the food was decent at best.

3/5, not terrible but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant for hearty, healthy, home style food.  I don't really want to post a review because I want to keep this my own private hidden gem. However, the owners are such nice people I can't keep them from being profitable and I must share the wonderful cuisine of Mr. Ravivos with all. 

The owners are Russian-Jews from Isreal.  The food they serve is middle-eastern/Greek. The menu offers homemade humus, babaganouish, egg plant with tomatoes, chicken livers, fresh fish, Shishkebabs.  Everything is made in house except for the pita bread. 

The salad and dressing are fresh and delicious. Homemade dressing is killer yum.  The grilled meats are wonderfully done to your liking - as is the fish. 

I strongly recommend this menu for all new visitors:
1.  Egg plant in tomato as appetizer to share btwn 2. 
2.  Chicken Shishkebab (dark is juicier) dinner to share. One dinner come with two giant skewers if meat.  When I am hungry I can eat a dinner to myself, but by the end I am so stuffed I can't walk straight. 

Other items I recommend:
- lamb souvlaki dinner
- tilapia is excellent ad served with head (as all fish should be)
- rainbow trout is grilled to perfection and so so good. 
- babaganouish 
- humus
- beef Shishkebab
- all the steaks are great
- make sure you try the rice. They make really yummy rice but they do have their off days. 

Now a bit of warning to you \"foodies\" who think a restaurant needs to have decor for the food to taste good... don't come here!!!  The decor is atrocious and outdated.  But rest assured, my picky butt wouldn't keep going back (for years) if the food wasn't top notch. 

The balding older gentleman (Boris) is quite misunderstood and makes bad first impressions.  The reason for this is because even when he smiles he looks like he is grimacing.  He's got a rough look about him but he is just like his restaurant: the exterior might be shabby, but when it come to what matters (food), he - like his food - is awesome!  Don't believe me?  Go and check out his portions.  For the price you pay, you cannot find a better value dinner for the whopping portions he offers!

I can't say enough about the food here. It's healthy, it's yummy and there is usually enough for take out so I can get two meals out of it. 

I really like the owners. After so many years you see how charming and cute both the mom and pop are.  And the Russian exterior is not intimidating at all and you can actually see the smile on the face of Boris when he attempts one. 

My 5 star rating reflects the quality of ingredients ( fresh and healthy), the total lack of pretense, and supreme value that rivals any cheap Chinese joint.   All I can tell you is I've introduced every one of my close friends to this place and now this is their go to place for family gatherings that require catering when he doesn't want to cook.  

Give it a try. I know you'll like it."}
{"text":"Little neighborhood restaurant (take-out available) that serves very tasty lamb kebabs and other Mediterranean food.

Price is very decent for the quality and quantity you get (a bunch of pita bread, plenty of side, even cucumbers and cabbage)."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with my family because it's very close to home and did the trick especially since I like to eat healthy but two years ago I had a horrible experience.

I came in on Christmas eve to get some take out before leaving for vacation, I was starving and nothing else was open. I walked in and the owners looked at me like there was something wrong with me for walking in, so very intimidated I asked them if they were open. When they said yes I said I'd like to order a shwarma on a pita and very rudely the man said NO SANDWICHES! So I said okay I guess I'll get the shwarma dinner, and he said NO SHWARMA, so I said oaky I guess I'll get the chicken kebob dinner. At that point I should have walked out and gone home and made a frozen meal but I was starving so I went with it. The meal ended up being like 16 bucks and humungous which wasn't really what I was looking for. I was almost in tears at that point after experiencing such crappy treatment so I sat outside on my phone while waiting for my food. When I came back in to pick it up the owner tried to make conversation with me about the weather or something but I had zero interest in having anything to do with him. I paid and left and never returned since.

The interior of the place is really ugly and cheap looking and I dreaded when my family wanted to go in to sit. You can literally wear pyjamas there if you wanted to. The water glasses are tiny and they rarely ever give ice. The portions are huge which is nice but if you want good middle eastern food your best bet is Me Va Me or Sofra, same stuff, nicer place and better service.

Also apparently they lost their liquor license because they let some guy leave the place hammered and he crashed his car..yeah."}
