{"text":"The service I received here was terrible. I ordered a veggie Pizza and the crust was soaked through like mush and burnt at the same time. when I spoke to management about it she stated that the cook said it was too many veggies on it and that's how it turns out. I have had many veggie pizzas made and never had one end up like this. I asked about the free garlic knots advertised on here and everyone acted as if the were dumb. I believe that they are prejudice as they treated me and my beau like dirt. Being that we were people of color. It was horrible. I will never go back and I have never been treated this way in any place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love this place. Got the Salmon Pizza this time, and it was good. I think that a thinner spread of the dill sauce would have made it less salty, but I still ate three-quarters of it before saving the rest for later."}
{"text":"Bought a $20 for $10 Groupon.  Absolutely insane considering how good this pizza is.  Good, old fashioned pizza with fresh ingredients, the way it should be.  The Pepperoni Supreme is everything I've ever wanted in a pizza."}
{"text":"Liked the decor, good menu choices. The lil Wheezy cheesy pizza was very good and the knots were excellent. The waitperson Christina was very nice and fun. Small place, very busy, and very loud."}
{"text":"Great selection of local beers. Food comes out relatively fast after you order. I got the pepperoni calzone. It came with mozeralla sauce and asked for some spicy honey on the side. Everything was delicious. The ricotta and mozzarella was nice and melty while the outer cal zone shell was crunchy. The pepperoni was thick and juicy.   Highly recommend trying the honey with your pizza.   I do think they should have servers instead of ordering at the door then sitting down since the line can get long and there's not much space by the register."}
{"text":"Their pizza is excellent (definitely one of my favorites in Charlotte), but we cannot get past the customer service and attitudes of the employees. Regardless of the day/time of our visit or how busy they are, any request large or small seems to be too bothersome for them to deal with. Sadly, I might go as far to say worst customer service in Charlotte.  We'll probably occasionally go back because the pizza is very good, but I cringe at the thought of dealing with whoever is behind the counter."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte.   Wild mushroom is my favorite hands down but you really can't go wrong with any of their pizzas."}
{"text":"I've only had one kind of pizza at Pure Pizza, but I loved it. I had the 5 cheese pizza on sprouted grain dough. I went at lunchtime on a weekday, and it wasn't that crowded (granted it was a Friday in the summer, when it seems to me like half of Charlotte doesn't go to work, so maybe it's busier other days). The 7th Street Market is a series of different, almost booth like, stores, from fresh juices, to a coffee bar, to a bakery to a butcher's case, and Pure Pizza is just about in the middle of it. You order up at the counter, and then site in a food court like area, and they bring the pizza out to you when it's done. It took a while for the pizza to come out, especially since I was on my lunch break, but once it arrived, it was well worth the wait! The 5 cheeses blended perfectly, but the best part was really the sprouted grain crust. They gave us a litle side of honey to dip the crust in, but it wasn't even needed, The crust had almost a baked in sweetness to it. I did dip in the honey once, but it was almost distracting from the full flavor the crust had on its own.  I ordered the 10\", to share with someone, and it was the perfect size. 3 regular sized (not those extra huge pieces you see sometimes now) for each person.  I loved the pizza, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally a good pizza spot on my side of town.  EVERYTHING I've tried has  been absolutely FAB! Fresh ingredients,  great beer choices  and the staff is so friendly.  I can't tell enough people about Pure Pizza!"}
{"text":"I had a tastey salmon pizza on ancient grain dough. I think the toppings could be a little heavier ;-) next oll rewuest well done too!"}
{"text":"INITIAL THOUGHTS: I was pretty disappointed by this place since I had visited their website and saw all the awards they had won so the expectation was pretty high. I just wanted to get the pizza as take out and wasn't staying for a table. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place was about 75% full and I only saw 1 server working the whole dining room. So my first impression of the place is that no one is there to greet me or take my order. Maybe people are laid back in Plaza Midwood and don't expect much, but note to owner: HIRE MORE STAFF. The guy at the counter who was actually making pizzas acknowledged me, took my order verbally, and made my pizza. By the time the server actually rang up my order the pizza was ready. So you do the math on how long I waited to pay.   THE FOOD: I ordered the truffle knots and gluten free pizza with chicken on top. The knots were a little burnt, and smaller than your average knot, but you got 6 of them in an order. The sauce to dip them was not thick enough and turned into a runny mess down your hand. The gluten free pizza crust was one of the WORST I have had in Charlotte. It was this puffy, under cooked, looked and tasted like wheat bread. The cheese looked and tasted gross. I picked off the chicken topping and ate only that. I threw the rest of it in the trash and stopped in the Dairy Queen down the road for an ice cream to get the gross taste of the place out of my mouth.    Basicly, bad all around and won't be going back. Waste of time and waste of money. Triple unhappy face. :( :(:(  ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AFTER PURE PIZZA WORKER COMMENTED ON MY REVIEW: For the record, I LOVE pizza! I HATE crappy pizza that I spend my hard earned money on and have to throw out in the trash. My review is clear and highlights their issues so they should work on that. Also, they should be able to handle criticism of their place when there are problems. Maybe they don't care about first impressions and greeting people at the door. You have been warned!"}
{"text":"We ordered a cheese pizza and it was quite good.   Garlic knots were phenomenal!  Marinara include with knots was really good too.  Ate outside and hung out on the train platform.  Good people watching!  Different honey dips were interesting and tasty.  Will come back if in the area. Staff was helpful although it was quite busy on a Saturday afternoon.  The yelp deal was only good after 4.  Not sure if that is still the case."}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: This is the pizza you have been looking for.  We ordered a pizza to go. The pizza box made it home but, um, the contents didn't. Not much more that I can add to that. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Went here with hubby and friends day before Valentine's. Entire 7th Street Public Market was slammed with people. We all spread out in search of yummy eats, and hubby and I were drawn to Pure Pizza for the aroma. Ordered a medium thin crust pepperoni and onion pizza and grabbed a seat right in front at the small bar area. They make a classic Neapolitan crust pizza, nice and thin. The pizza has a nice puffy (not burnt) edge. We usually leave what we call \"pizza bones,\" the outer edge of a pizza that's typically without much flavor. We found we consumed the entire pizza. Pepperoni was quite good. We watched Gino make all the pizzas, and you could tell he had decades of experience (confirmed after speaking with him for a moment.) It was fun to watch him. Some complained of the wait time. Gino cranked the pizzas out very quickly. We saw he was limited by how many he was able to fit in the oven. A little kindness goes a long way, people. A smile and a thumbs up to Gino and the rest of the gang was appreciated, and we appreciated the hot, tasty pizza!"}
{"text":"Im a big fan of Pizza and this place rocks!!! never had a bad pie there."}
{"text":"Pure Pizza is so fresh! Organic, gluten free, this is your place.. My favorite pizza is the T-Rex which is a meat lovers dream. There are also many vegetarian offerings. The roasted Brussels Sprouts were a big hit at out table as well.. The veggies mostly come from Windcrest organic farms in Monroe.. This place is 100 % amazing.."}
{"text":"Very welcoming environment, offering the best pizza around. Exceptional service and beer selection. A place to bring the whole family, there's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Juli, good news.  I've spoken with the fine folks over at Merriam-Webster and they have agreed to throw out the old definition of passive-aggressive and replace it with your reply.  Holy geez, that escalated quickly.  I don't feel I blasted your business at all.  I never said your employees were rude.  I made sure to make it known that your food is very good.  But perhaps I didn't make the lines far enough apart for you to read between.  So to clarify, one issue we have is the mystery pricing on the toppings.  I'm well aware that more toppings equal more money.  I'm just suggesting it would be nice to know how much money.  \"Starting at $1.50\" is vague.  I would just like to know is my sausage $1.50 or $2 or $3?  I don't like surprises when it comes to money...I doubt I'm alone on that. But the main issue we have is that your employees/managers are not empowered to the level that they should be.  I'm not a big groupon user.  I'm sorry I didn't know to scour the fine print for some arbitrary time that it was allowed.  But the fact is, we paid to park, we were there, we were hungry, we were looking forward to some great pizza, and it was not crowded at all...we were literally the only people eating at that time and it was only 45 minutes early.  So why draw a line in the sand on that when it would have taken 2 seconds to inform us of the time for future reference, work with us, and maintain a good relationship.  I'm sorry but that just makes sense to me.  If you want to go down with the \"you should have read the fine print\" ship, then by all means have at it."}
{"text":"Ordered last night and loved the food. Very clean meal with high quality food standards. I will be coming back more frequently. The website and the to-go ordering process could use some work, but other than that the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Customer service sucks. Dude on the phone was super concerned about closing at 7p when we called for pick up at 6:15p. Like he was doing us a favor to make a pizza or something.  But the pizza was good, the crust was soggy though, it might be because it had a crap ton of toppings. Whatevs, worth trying if you haven't been, we'll prob be back. The pizza was pretty good. Better than Fuel Southend."}
{"text":"Great place to come to grab a cheap, quick dinner!    The pizza is definately one of the better pies in Charlotte (nothing can compete with the NYC I grew up on!)  They use extremely fresh ingredients and have a wide variety of toppings/speciality pies.  I always get the ancient grain crust, which is definately one of the better grain crusts I have had.  The honey they offer to dip the crust in is a must!!  The wait time for dinner can get a little long during peak hours, so don't come hungry, but it's worth grabbing a beer and waiting for!"}
{"text":"Great fresh pizza! We had the 5 cheese pizza and it was so good! We got the regular crust and it came with honey to dip it in. I have never tried that and let me say it went perfectly together! Wanna go back to try another pizza or calzone!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to leave a negative 1 star but 1 will have to do: there was a LIVE tiny cockroach walking on the top of my pizza. It was ALIVE. It was a small roach but a roach. An apartment style roach and not a bug. A roach. I am grateful it was a live and not dead: I could have eaten it. But I am traumatized and do not want to eat out ever. I do not know 100% it was PURE: I have never ordered from them before, I have never seen how clean they are and my food was delivered so the delivery person could have had a filthy car. But I felt morally obligated to share this because it happened to me and it freaked me out. I would want to know. This happened on November 8, 2017. grossed. out."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town -- you simply cannot beat it.  Have been a handful of times, and have never had a bad experience.  Staff is super friendly, and anything you get on the menu will be out of this world.  Would go every night if calories did not exist."}
{"text":"Love the 7th street Public Market & esp. Pure Pizza. We didn't realize they offered such healthy options (sprouted dough until after we ordered) so we'll def. try that next time. Saturday was a perfect time to stop @ the Market with the parking available right across the street & the light rail stop @ their doorstep."}
{"text":"Vegan and Veggie selections. Organic Lenny Boy beer. That's 5 stars right off the bat! Cheers"}
{"text":"Gonna make this short and sweet.   I'm an NY Italian and a bit of a pizza snob. I usually like my pizza just sauce and cheese like in NYC. This place however puts a whole new spin on gourmet pizza.  I love this place. I have yet to find something that isn't unique and completely delicious. Highly recommend the Wild Mushroom & Truffle pizza!  Update: the nice people at Pure Pizza gave me a free pizza coupon for my original review. My girlfriend & I went last night and I think their pizza hot even more delicious since last time! If you haven't gone yet... GO!"}
{"text":"So yummy! You can't go wrong with the food here. Service is great too. They made a mistake and put onions on my pizza and were quick to make me another one without. When you check in, they reward you with free knots. Don't forget those. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Popped in to Pure Pizza to give it a try on my lunch break, as my co-worker raves about it. It can be pricey depending on the pie you get, but honestly it's worth it. The ingredients are local and fresh, and you don't feel like crap after eating it. The staff is super friendly and great at recommendations! I normally stay pretty basic with pizza and am really picky with sauces, but Geno's D Pie was incredible. Definitely support!"}
{"text":"The person who helped me recommended The Chorizo and I couldn't agree more. Good pizza with nice and light crust. I definitely recommend Pure Pizza and The Public Market."}
{"text":"Delicious food with a perky and helpful staff. I recommend the pulled pork pizza-- it was crispy and delicious, but on the greasy side (which I don't mind once in a while!). One negative: the cashier told me that the pizza had no egg products... but the cabbage slaw they plopped onto the middle of the pie was mayo-based. Yikes."}
{"text":"All the flavor without the yucky stuff. Hubby and I purchased 2 pizzas, the Pesto with sprouted crust and added chicken... oh the flavor was sooo AMAZING! We also got a savory large T-Rex... We loved them both. The organic, fresh ingredients are what drew me but the taste has made me a loyal customer for LIFE! Worth the 1 1/2 drive to get it!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite pizza place in Charlotte. If you're wondering if I've actually tried all the pizza places, the answer is yes. I've tried them all from University to Montford.   Pure Pizza uses fresh ingredients and the crust is cooked to perfection. My boyfriend doesn't eat crust but Pure Pizza has converted him by serving a small cup of honey to dip your crust into after the slices have been devoured.   The staff is always friendly, quick, and my orders are always accurate.   A must try in Plaza Midwood and I definitely recommend the T-Rex!"}
{"text":"Overall great experience! Friendly service, from the person taking our order making sure he got everything right, to the person making the pizza who took time to wave and smile at my toddler who was watching. The pizza was delicious; it satisfies my pizza craving without the post-pizza, greasy feeling! We ordered half chorizo and half wild mushroom on ancient grain crust. The chorizo was my favorite, the fresh cilantro and radish add freshness and texture to the bold flavor of the chorizo. Used the Yelp $20 for $10 deal and free garlic knots with check-in. For pizza of this quality it was a steal! My son inhaled the garlic knots... so good!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. For the non foodies that have given  less than 5 stars you should probably visit dominoes.  This is the second time I visited and it didn't disappoint. We had the \"Weezy Five Cheezy\". Smoked Mozz, Goat cheese etc. One of the best pizza's we ever had. A secret sauce they say on the menu. Excellent local beers and the dressings for the side salads made in house. Don't forget to ask for the cloister honey to dip your crust. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Poor Charlotte. If this is your best pizza. Ordered xtra cheese and pepperoni. Got a kind of warm, paper thin crust, dry like sand,  very salty. almost no sauce, with NO cheese taste at all! For 20 bucks! I would have preferred a Tombstone to this crap. Every city deserves to have good pizza and this sure ain't it. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Both my friend and I were super pleased with the pizza. Only complaint either of us had was that we felt the chorizo pizza should have had more chorizo on it. I'll definitely be back. My mushroom and truffle oil pizza was to die for."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  We have eaten here a few times and always love it.  Our favorites are the Mushroom and BBQ Chicken pizzas.  Sprouted grain crust and different honeys to dip the crust in.  YUM!  Probably the healthiest pizza you can eat, but delicious!  We also love the 7th Street Market and the various vendors. The building will validate your parking for 2 hours..  You can get dessert at the booth next door."}
{"text":"New Yorker here... Best pizza in town next to Fuel. I am looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Highly enjoyed my 2nd visit to Charlotte's Farm to Fork, Organic Pizzeria!  It's not very often that you come across a restaurant with great gluten free options, but to come across a pizza place that offers gluten free is almost unheard of. It's not just a regular pizza place either, this is all organic - local - farm fresh - deliciousness!  Guilt free carbs if you will :) We will be back and are letting all our vegan, vegetarian and gluten free friends know about this hot spot.  PS - They carry Vegan cheese for those who are also dairy free."}
{"text":"As a girl who grew up outside New Haven, CT.... I know my pizza.  Gino and his gang at Pure Pizza know how it's done.  Best pizza I've had outside of CT!  Dough is perfect balance of crunch and chewy.  Sauce is fantastic.  The fresh, local, organic ingredients are DELICIOUS!  May fly back to Charlotte just to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to Plaza Midwood. Great customer service and the food was delicious. Had the breakfast sandwiches and hash browns. Both were superb. The homemade bread on the sandwiches was really good."}
{"text":"nice setting in a collection of \"artisan\" type places...salad was good, pizza sprouted grains crust was ok, but not that different from say a whole wheat crust I've had other places....and they were skimpy on the toppings, which I never like so can't really go beyond three stars  next time might try the crepe place or the grilled cheese sandwich shop in the same setting here"}
{"text":"I liked the taste of all the ingredients quite a bit but the crust doesn't fully do it for. Could be crispier."}
{"text":"Great selection of pizzas. Went with the TRex and highly recommend it. I guess growing up as a kid with only Pizza Hut for pizza you tend to go with the meat lovers style. Fantastic flavor. The crust was solid. Nicely balanced. Oven cooked. It really complimented the toppings without getting in the way. This place is worth a stop if you are downtown. I liked the \"public market\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the best impromptu pizza place I've been to in a while. We got the calzones. One with pepperoncini and bacon, the other with spinach and chicken. What a great flavor! We sat at the bar top in front of where the chef, Lance, made our calzones and it was so great! It was like paying an everyday price for an in the kitchen dinner. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"An extremely rude employee at Pure Pizza (7th Street location) came from arround the counter and into the dining area and loudly shouted obscenities to me and slammed trays on the counter after I mistakenly placed my tray in the wrong cart for dirty dishes. My co-workers and I were embarrassed and humiliated. This site obviously lacks good customer service!"}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor of the Pure Pizza in 7th Street Market, I was pumped there was a new location opening within a mile of my house. We decided to check out the new place on a Saturday night. As always, the food did not disappoint! My husband and I split a greek salad and BBQ chicken pizza. Portions were generous and we love the honey to compliment the crust. However, I was not as impressed with the flow of the restaurant. We ordered at the counter, which was a little awkward because there was a long time but the menus were at the front of the line. Then were told someone would bring us napkins, utensils but no one ever did. We noticed that other tables were being \"waited\" on but not ours. Additionally, we were informed that there was no tap water, just bottled water for purchase. What?! As a place that composts and uses foil and not to-go boxes, I couldn't believe it. We had just walked there and were thirsty. I got over it because I liked the pizza so much! Our next time visiting, we will probably just do to-go orders."}
{"text":"Amazing. Had a 10 inch with ham, basil and garlic. Devoured it in no time flat. (While using honey on the crust of course.) Totally delicious and the staff was as excellent as the food. The recommended beer I had with it was tasty as well. A win all around. Wish this was in my city."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Pure Pizza out you should give it a try soon. Not sure exactly what they do or how they do it but they really have something special in their pizza crust and focaccia bread. Maybe there are gluten fairies working in secret or something - not sure but all I know is it's darn good.   I have had their pizza multiple times and you can't go wrong there. Try the smoked salmon pizza for something a little different. Today I ventured down and had their caprese focaccia sandwich and it was nothing short of amazing. Just simple and delicious.   Not really sure what else I can say. Gave them four stars but probably like 4.5."}
{"text":"Being gluten free is not only difficult it leads to awful tasting pizza or bread. Today I tasted the best fluffy crunchy dough like eating real pizza all over again! And it's healthy!!!! Yes!! I felt grateful and thankful to them for yummy pizza, but also for caring enough to make a difficult crust to satisfy those with no other choice!!!! Your time and effort does not go unnoticed. Can't wait to go back! Oh and not gf that pizza rocked too according to friend and kids with us!  Many thanks!!"}
{"text":"This by far was the best gluten free pizza I have ever had. Once stuck on this new way of living all gf pizza crust is awful bland and boring. For the first time in a while i tasted fluffy crunchy crust that belongs with pizza. I was so grateful and thankful for taking the time and effort to figure this out!!! From the bottom of my heart thank you for giving me pizza back! Also the regular was awesome too per my kids and friend! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients in all menu items, friendly service and the honey dipping sauce is a very nice compliment. Clean dining area, with charming rustic decor."}
{"text":"Pure Pizza has been one of my favorite pizza spots in the city for a long time and this new location only continues this trend. The pepperoni supreme remains one of my favorite pizza options. I tried the deli pie and that was very good as well. The roasted brussels sprouts had nice flavor but I would have preferred for them to have been a little more tender. Other than that, this was a perfect first visit to the new location and I look forward to many more!"}
{"text":"A friend invited me and my husband to the Top Chef challenge across the street from the 7th Street Market, and after she RAVED this was her favorite pizza in Charlotte, we had to try out a few Pure pizzas.   The setup of pure is like a food court-- order at the counter, and take a seat, and wait for your food. The pies took no time to come out.   We tried the pulled pork pizza, which was divine.  The dough so chewy and crisp, and slightly sweet.  The pie is topped with pickled cabbage for a nice fresh crisp and tang.    The chorizo pizza was flavor packed too...as was the simple tomato and cheese.    BTW: Each pizza comes with a tiny container of local honey.  Honey!  To dip your crust.  Even folks who aren't crust eaters will appreciate the touch.    BTW Part 2: If you can't make it down to the market, Pure made an appearance at the last Chow Down food truck rally.   BTW Part 3:  We had the regular crust and the sprouted...and honestly, there's not much difference when your pizza's got so many toppings and intense flavors.  I'd try both...the sprouted just makes you feel healthier :-)"}
{"text":"So close to a five star rating, but I wasn't jumping up and down in my pants - just very happy and looking forward to going back. Enough? Definitely.   Roger and I shared a white mushroom pizza on sprouted grain dough recommended by a friend and fan in California. Delicious. Artfully layered and flavored and almost melting on my tongue. I'm still tasting it today.   While sitting, two friends happened to stop by for a pizza and ordered the single packaged glasses of wine. Sweet! Wish I had thought of that idea. Next time.  An artisan eatery that is worth a visit or two or three. So, happy to find some other crafty places in Charlotte. Maybe I'm starting to like it here."}
{"text":"You know when people say 'Mellow Mushroomm is awesome!\" and you think to yourself \"Man their crust is so rough and heavy that it dominates the pizza\" or \"Their ingredients are pretty lackluster\" or \"It's such a rip off\".  Well you don't have to have those thoughts at Pure Pizza. I don't know how they do it, but their crust is wheaty, the perfect amount of salty, hearty, and SOFT. On the top at least. The bottom has a perfect amount of crusty crunch.  I'm sure they calibrate their oven pretty regularly because this level of crust perfection is incredibly rare. I didn't want to oversell the place or \"get involved\" immediately but if you're the same sort of masochist and bite the plain crust before even getting into the sublime experience of the actual pizza like I did, you'll be happy.  We had the pizza supreme. Absolutely incredible. The thinly sliced garlic was the coup de grace. Plus the market it's in was awesome. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. I would say the best pizza in Charlotte. I get the sprouted ancient grain which is great. They give you flavored honey to dip your crust in which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Visited from FL. Tried for the first time it was definitely one of the best pizza's I've had. Don't forget to ask for the honey to dip your bread."}
{"text":"My wife and I were big fans of the 7th Street Market location and really enjoyed our first visit to the new location. It's definitely one of the best pizzas in Charlotte. (Even though I like a good traditional pizza, I'm also a big fan of the Deconstructed Pulled Pork.) I also appreciate that they have plenty of local beer.  Kind of stunned by some of the negative reviews. Don't be turned off. Go give it a shot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love pizza. LOVE it! Unfortunately at most pizza places the pizzas are loaded with crap that I refuse to put in my body. Pure pizza is different, I feel good about eating it (no GMOs, no high fructose corn syrup, no refined oils) and it is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the pesto pizza on the spouted ancient grain dough - soooooo good!"}
{"text":"The farmers salad was bomb! The pizza was a little better than average but as a disclaimer I'm a pizza cook at a 4 star restaurant. I love that they use local ingredients, in fact that's what drew me in. Also, the beer suggestion was on point. Overall worth a try especially if you're looking for quality , local ingredients."}
{"text":"I went back to give Pure Pizza another try.  It is definitely one of the best pizza joints in the area...and there are many.  The Mediterranean Pizza was excellent!  (Mushrooms, black olives, spinach, feta, etc).  I got the Farmers Salad again and I am just not a big fan. Service was excellent!  Eric took great care of us!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and absolutely LOVE that they offer sprouted crust!"}
{"text":"Must have!!! Don't forget to add honey to the crust. You won't be disappointed. If you like meat, try the T-Rex. It's mouthwatering"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had.  Some of the worst service I've ever experienced.  Will say it wasn't rude service, our waitress just couldn't keep anything straight...and that happened with drinks, pizzas, and requested sauces.  But she was friendly.  Garlic knots are good (and free w Yelp check-in).  We did pizza with half pepperoni supreme and half with the Genoa salami.  Both were amazing."}
{"text":"Pizza was very dry and dominated by crust.  I just ate it and I am not even close to full.  Yes, they may have a great beer selection but so does everywhere else in plaza midwood so unfortunately that is not a differentiator anymore but more of the \"price of admission\" so to speak.  Tried the lulu which is the best seller.  I have no clue how they even call this stuff pizza.  Btw, it was $30 for a below average sized large pizza and knots.  My first and last trip."}
{"text":"One star for water on the table and one star for the rustic charm.  Everything else I ordered was atrocious. I got into Charlotte around 4:30. Had not eaten lunch but needed to shower and get going since I had somewhere to be for 6:30. At 8:30 we made our way back to where we were staying in the plaza Midwood area. I was a starving by this point. I was super excited to see that there was a restaurant saying they had fresh ingredients and gluten-free options. Even gluten-free garlic bread with marinara, how cool is that. So my son and I head over there... by this point it was around 9:15 and I was excited that they were going to still be open. Again we are starving and preparing to eat like kings. We order the pizza that has all the meats (i dont remember the name) on the gluten free crust as well as an order of the gluten-free garlic bread. I have to say I was shocked that it came out maybe 4 minutes after I ordered it. How do you cook a pizza and garlic bread in such a short time. Well when I took the first bite it was evident. I don't know how they cook this thing but I'm not exaggerating this was the absolute most disgusting gluten-free anything I've ever eaten. I took one bite of the garlic bread and actually spit it out into my napkin. I don't know how to even begin to describe the flavor of the crust. It just tasted like spongy something that had absorbed weird flavors that had nothing to do with a pizza or garlic bread. I turned my attention to the pizza which visually looked amazing but again it was on the same crust. It was so so so disgusting. I would say maybe it was just me but my son had the same look on his face like what is wrong with this pizza. We even tried to just scrape the toppings off of one slice and even that was just not working for us since somehow the toppings were cold.  We decided to just pay and go home hungry. I asked them to take the garlic bread off the tab since we literally didn't even eat it. They did and we paid the $16 for the gluten free pizza that we also barely ate. Maybe it's just not for us and I'm sure by other reviews that their standard pizza might be okay crust might be ok. The waitress told me I might would want to come back to try their salads, said they were delicious."}
{"text":"We came here for a little snack while waiting for our coffee on Friday. See my review for Not Just Coffee.  We ordered the individual pulled pork explosion to split between the two of us. Took about 10 minutes to cook and came out right to our table with some slaw on top (just like a pulled pork sandwich).  The pizza was amazing! Decent price and great location."}
{"text":"The wild mushroom pizza is my favorite.  I am a bit disappointed in the fact that I asked and got confirmation that the pepperoni was beef.  It turns out that it's not!  If you don't know,  just say that you don't know!"}
{"text":"I went back to Pure Pizza this weekend after Juli nicely offered to cover the meal. My experience was much better. The Brussels sprouts and mushroom apps were both great, as was our pizza. Our waitress was very personable and apologized for the last time, which she said she still remembered as one of the restaurant's busiest nights ever. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am not only a pizza fan but I have owned several pizzerias on the east coast, so I know pizza.  This was a pleasant delight with fresh locally grown veggies and a side order of Brussel sprouts that was so good. I give it a 2 thumbs up and can't wait to try their other pizzas on the menu.  I wanted pineapple which they don't have because it is not local to the area, as the server advised me.  She  suggested the balsamic glazed w pesto, since I wanted something sweet. I did hold off on the onions.  My friend bought the lasagna like pizza, don't know what it is called because he is a regular and didn't request it by name.    Formally Lu lu's which I had visited often, I am glad to see this cute trendy pizza place make some great product. It deserves a visit from you."}
{"text":"The service was not great and there was gross stuff floating in the tap water they gave us it the food was good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and beer selection! Located in uptown charlotte inside the 7th street public market.  Awesome place to have some casual pizza, have a beer, relax and enjoy the rest of the market."}
{"text":"To me, the true mark of an excellent restaurant is consistency.  Pure Pizza is that.  Quick, courteous service.  Fantastic food. It has been 5 star at every one of my visits."}
{"text":"Artisan pizza. It's a thing these days with healthy crusts, organic toppings, local ingredients. All of these things attracted me to Pure Pizza as well as the top-notch reviews. I tend to order gluten-free when possible so I tried the GF and also the sprouted crust for my first Pure experience. This is after searching their website's menu, speaking of which--thanks for putting up detailed listings of your delicious combos but HEY can you please put how much your pizzas cost and also what sizes are available!? This became problematic when calling to order because the online menu does not specify what sizes you can get certain crusts made with.  Meh. It was good, not great, but pretty good. The GF crust was crisp on the bottom but had a slight cream of wheat texture on top. Having eaten GF many times I get that it won't be like the \"real\" thing, Pure was definitely tasty but the texture still was, ummm, interesting. The ancient grain crust was also tasty but still was slightly lacking for non-GF pizza. I did however really like that they give you a side of locally-sourced honey to dip your crust with, this is something I never would've thought myself but quite enjoyed it.  If someone asked me to recommend a place to get GF pizza I'd recommend this place, but if someone asked to just recommend a good pizza place I'd tell them to head to Portofino's or Fuel first."}
{"text":"Loved the story I read in the news;  http://m.wsoctv.com/news/news/plaza-midwood-pizzerias-bathroom-sign-garnering-na/np4J5/  I will be coming in during my next trip to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We stopped here as the place received great reviews on Yelp.  If you're not from Charlotte, this place is a little hard to find as nothing is really labeled on the street.  It was really nice looking from inside the market.  I knew the price of the pizza was going to be more than your standard pizza, but was willing to pay it based upon the great reviews they received.    Upon receiving the pizzas, I noticed that we did not get what we ordered (we received 2 plain cheese pizzas instead of specialty pizzas).  When I went back to inquire on this, they stated I was charged for a plain pizza and not a specialty pizza, and they messed up my order on accident (yet on the phone they repeated my order after I stated what I wanted, so I'm not sure how they could have messed it up).  They said they would make us new ones if I had 10 minutes to spare, but after already waiting to get the pizza I ordered, I did not have time to wait for them to correct their mistake. They should have refunded me my money for their mess up (that would have been better customer service).  Now the pizza, for being plain cheese, was not great.  The crust was very thin and almost rubber like. Now my kids eat just about any kind of pizza, and they would not eat this!    I would say pass on this place as it is just not worth the cost of the pizza with bland taste and bad customer service skills."}
{"text":"The unique pizza choices are amazing! Great selection of local beers. Worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Who else has farm to table fresh pizza as good as Pure Pizza? It's pure and it's wonderful. Never had a bad pie here! All of the elements of the pizza pies work so well together. The crust, the cheese, the sauce, the toppings, even the honey for the crust. One of my favorite pizza spots in Charlotte. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The most delicious pizza in Charlotte and lots of vegan options. They lose a stay for being hilariously stingy with the honey, which isn't enough for 1 slice, let alone a whole pizza. Either offer me a reasonable portion, charge me for a reasonable portion, or don't offer it at all. Otherwise, 5 stars for flavor and offerings."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in all Charlotte.  Their service is amazing & they remember customers very well which is awesome. They are super nice and overall the service is great I highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Nestled in the marketplace, it is hard to not know that this place exists but glad my friends introduced me to it.  Traditional entrees (ie lasagna) spread on to a pizza. While it wasn't as large as I hoped, it was alright for a lunch pizza. Had a variety of toppings and as a few others stated, I could eat this every day and not get tired of it since they have a great variety of menu items to choose from."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. We got the pepperoni with garlic and ham. It was good but we didn't ask for the garlic and it was a pretty overwhelming flavor. The mushroom and sausage pizza that we got was very good as well. The Market area is nice as well."}
{"text":"I have tried both locations, and neither disappoint! Tonight, I accidentally called the 7th Street location thinking I was ordering from Central. Upon arrival at Central, I realized my mistake. I called 7th Street to cancel my order not wanting to travel uptown in the rain. They were so cool about it that I called back to pay for my original order and asked them to donate it to another customer. We need more small businesses like this. If they only delivered...  Great thin crust pizza! Even better customer service. I've been to 7th once, and to Central twice. They take care of their customers."}
{"text":"I LOVE pizza and love vegan pizza to boot so I was happy to see Pure have vegan cheese on their menu. I had the brussels sprouts sans bacon or cheese, which were delicious! Often when you take away the bacon the dish loses its flavor, but not in this case. Then I had a custom pizza with vegan cheese, bell pepper, and arugula. The pepper was somewhat sparse but not a huge deal. It was very good. The crust was clearly fresh. They tossed a bit of olive oil on the arugula which was a nice move.  The staff seemed quite bored and not exactly thrilled about working but alas. There was a rambunctious group in the back but nothing egregious. My only real complaint is that their music was far too loud, especially for 6pm on a Monday night. Otherwise, I recommend this spot and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First, don't try calling because their phone is not connected.  Second,  if you want to order a large pie before 4 pm on the weekend your out of luck.  I don't know how they think they will stay in business with this model.  But there are a lot of other choices for piza in Plaza Midwood where I can go,"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I can officially declare fandom.  The pizza is good. The ingredients are noticeably fresh - the sweet bell peppers are particularly delightful. I've tried the original crust and the special \"ancient grain\" crust.  Both are a thin, chewy/grainy kind of feeling and have that oven fired taste.  They go easy on the sauce here, and there's an adequate amount of cheese (I personally like my pizzas to be dangerously cheesy, perhaps next time I'll just ask for it).  And definitely try dipping the crust in the chili-honey sauce, it's a nice touch.  Service is pretty quick, and the owner is super friendly.  It's a solid joint."}
{"text":"Classic NY Style pizza! Definitely on my top 3 favorite pizza places in Charlotte. They have fun and unique topping arrangements but even the boring old classic pepperoni is fantastic.   Great spot for big groups since the market is set up with an extremely open plan.   LOCATION TIP: Pure is inside of the 7th Street Public Market. An easy place to park is the deck located between Brixx & Queen City Q."}
{"text":"Pure pizza was pure heaven!   The crust was thin and crispy/chewy,  made with freshly ground organic flour. The smoked mozzarella was rich and savory - just the right amount. I made a pig of myself, and I don't regret it."}
{"text":"My wife and I stop into the Market to catch lunch. We had never been there before. Iam glad we stop at Pure Pizza because the Italian sandwich was on point(very good). I look forward ro going back."}
{"text":"Changing my previous 4 stars to 5. This place is just unbeatable. I've tried brickx, pizza fusion, and others. No one makes pizza like these guys. My typical order is garlic knots (awesome), Greek salad, (awesome), specialty pizza, (BBQ and pepperoni supreme are redic), and a local tap while we wait. This is a once a month treat where I go crazy at the public market. There's no other organic pizza place like pure pizza."}
{"text":"I love Pure Pizza! Their pimento cheese is AMAZING, pizza delish but my favorite is the caprese sandwich! I wish I would have taken pictures of it, I've had it twice and it was to die for! Highly recommend coming in before the lunch rush! Service was great, atmosphere wonderful and an all around great meal!"}
{"text":"Yay for vegan options!!! We had the 16\" She-Rex with vegan cheese. We were afraid we couldn't finish it between the two of us... but let me tell you the crust is light and crisp and thin and perfect!! Great chew. You'll definitely get full but there's a delicious lightness to the food. Probably stems from their amazing local produce and commitment to organic and non GMO sources. Everything we so fresh and tasty. I also had a local IPA, and the husband went for a local porter. Highly recommend if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Pure Pizza is awesome! They have the best honey to dip your crust into and I tried both the cinnamon and the regular.  I like their vegan cheese since I'm lactose intolerant and also want my pizza to have flavor goodness and pizzazz.   I made a vegan margarita pizza and loved it! The white wine was smooth and crisp too, cannot remember the vintage but I would order it again.  I like the fact they have composting and super helpful waiters."}
{"text":"While the prices are a bit high for a make-your-own pizza, the taste makes up for it. I love going to Seventh Street market, sitting Not Just Coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from Pure.  I've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market, and I can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated. So try to eat it fresh while there if possible.  If one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you, go for it, as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money.  I wanted what I wanted, though, so I ended up with a medium, thin crust, regular crust pizza with jalapenos, pepperoncini, onions and feta.  It was pretty expensive at $2/topping = $20 med pizza. But it was delicious.  The arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to-die-for. I crave that dressing days later. So light and fresh but flavorful."}
{"text":"Well, I was hoping to be the first, but it seems I've been beaten to the punch - which is AWESOME!  Great food - perfect location to get a new business started.  And the organic wines and NC brewed beers are also delicious.  Join and see that eating healthy can be fun and good for your brain.  Their crust is delicious!  Supported by iFred.org as brain healthy food for your mood."}
{"text":"Not much can be said about this place except...... \"DAAAAMMMNNNN THAT FOOD IS BOMB\" I have never had good pizza outside of jersey and this place has got it.  We go here everytime were in the area"}
{"text":"On my inaugural trip to the 7th Street Market, I ate at Pure Pizza. I had heard all the buzz and knew I had to try to try out and see if the hype was legit... And it was!  I had the the Pesto Pizza with the whole wheat crust and it was phenomenal!  Normally after eating pizza, you get that ucky sensation (and not just from consuming calories!) but Pure Pizza was very 'clean'.  I thought that the ingredients were very fresh and it was very well presented.  The side of honey to go with the crust was a great touch and truly showed the love and thought that went into the menu creation!  The staff was very welcoming and pleasant and i'm sure I will be back again."}
{"text":"Pure Pizza is my. kind. of 'za.   To start things off, we got free garlic knots with our check in on Yelp! Love that. The marinara sauce with the knots was legit, and we made sure to keep the leftover to dip our pizza, too.  I had a side caesar after the knots and before the pizza that was pretty good as well. I think it was butter lettuce in the salad which I'm not a huge fan of, but the salad was cold, served in a cold bowl, and the dressing and croutons were good.  On to the pizza. The way the pizza is made, I'm not sure exactly how to classify the style, but I know it's what I look for in a pizza and it reminds me of what I used to eat growing up. Flavorful but not overbearing toppings/sauce with a slightly thinner than your regular hand-tossed crust that ends up being super crunchy. It's an A+ pie in my book.  I got the Slap Yo Mama Lasagna pizza that included Tomato sauce, Mozzarella, Ricotta, ground beef, onions, garlic, herbs. It was SO GOOD. Nothing too fussy but still a ton of flava in ya ear.  Going through the menu, there's also a good variety of vegetarian and gluten-free options if you're into that kind of thing. My girlfriend got the She Rex - Mozzarella, mushrooms, onion, peppers, topped with greens tossed in lemon vinaigrette, and the slices I had of that were also real good.  The next time I get pizza that is not way way too late been drinking too much pizza, it's 100% going to be Pure Pizza."}
{"text":"My friend talked about this place so much, maybe that influenced but the pork pizza was not good at all.   The slaw in the middle was not appetizing, and the pizza was just meh.   Hesitant if I should try something else, because it was not worth the $$$"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by this spot with a Groupon late on a Saturday evening, just before closing. We tried the pulled pork pizza with a couple of pints. Two words: AWESOME SAUCE!   The pizza had unforgettable flavor, combining sweet, savory, and acidic into a delicious bite. Also, the staff was more than accommodating-they gave us remarkable service in spite of our lateness. Most definitely worth the ten bucks we paid for the groupon-even worth the sticker price."}
{"text":"I think they should rename this place Pure Heaven Pizza. I'm embarrassed at how long it took me to try this place especially since I know one of the owners. But with an office in SouthEnd and this being in an area with only paid parking around, it always got pushed down the list. Well parking should not be a deterrent- all the places in 7th Street Market validate parking- woo hoo!   So I met someone for lunch at the market and Pure Pizza has definitely built a good base of clientele because they had a sizable line. I got to the front and asked Juli her top recommendation which was the wild mushroom pizza. I think I'm going to be stuck like JJ because there is no reason to move on.  The wild mushroom pizza has some tasty shitake mushrooms (as opposed to shitakes that sometimes taste like dirt which I call shitty shitakes) as well as some other varieties, drizzled with truffle oil. I tried it on the sprouted crust which is lower in gluten, and I paid attention to the tip about also drizzling honey they offer all patrons. You yelpers are sharp, my friends.   I had an epiphany when I tried the savory meets sweetness all on a pizza. There weren't too many pizzas in Charlotte I get extremely excited about, but this pizza changed my life and my outlook. It's not a thick crust, but still somehow substantial. I don't know what kind of cheese they use, but it doesn't upset my stomach like a lot of cheeses, and that with the low-gluten crust made my tummy very happy and guilt-free.    I guess some people might want other choices (not me, my love- I will stay true to you,  Wild Mushroom) so there is a \"lasagna\" pizza and some other carnivorous options as well as sandwiches and salads for vegetarian/vegans.  I think I just might have this for dinner."}
{"text":"One of fav pizza joints in Charlotte. Not \"traditional\" pizza, but you're just not gonna find Chicago pizza in Charlotte (so I've given up looking). The crust is the right balance of crisp and chewy, the sauce is righteous, but it's the ingredients that make this place. Fresh and yummy with awesome combinations like truffle oil and mushrooms, or pepperoni with banana peppers and garlic. And they've got great salads too, when you wanna balance your Za with some greenery."}
{"text":"Huge huge fan.  Got some of the BBQ chicken pizza which was the poop...  Ordered to go, but seemed like a cool place to chill.  Unfortunately my friends are lame and don't want to hang out w/ me anymore."}
{"text":"Usually dine here 2 times a week! Their sandwiches and calzones are great. Always wonderful service and tasty meals!"}
{"text":"Yep...it's official this pizza is the bomb.com!    After chatting up the staff I let my inner meat monster out and went with the T-Rex pizza basically because it's got everything pepperoni, beef, ham, bacon...Mmmmm!   After about 10 minutes my masterpieces arrived. I chose the original crust and my goodness it was pretty delicious!   And that honey...Wowsers! Now, I admit I never thought of honey and pizza being a great combination so I was a bit hesitant but seriously just DO IT! Absolutely delicious!  Heck yeah, I'm coming back! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Pure Pizza recently and was impressed by the quality of the pie they're serving up! I ordered my pizza from the chalkboard above the cash register with a little help from the guy who took my order. He helped me to decide which crust and even sauce that was to go on my pizza. I decided on a 3-Cheese pizza on traditional crust with a \"special sauce\". It was de-lish! My pizza was brought right to me as I waited at a small table in the 7th st market nearby. The gentleman who brought my pizza even asked me if I needed anything else, although I'm sure he didn't have to. The 7th St. Market seems to be very much self-serve.   If I'm craving a personal pizza in uptown in the future, I'll be sure to return to Pure Pizza and try another yummy pie. Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Pure Pizza, loved their pizza at 7th Street Market, and love their new location even more. Everything I have tried so far has been incredible, service has always been nice and attentive, love to chat with Juli the owner. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a large pie from their downtown location. The sauce and ingredients were fantastic. Greezy but a nice flop. I really enjoyed it. Maybe my new favorite pizza in Charlotte. The crust was a little boring but everything else amazing."}
{"text":"The pizza here is AMAZING. It is NOT NYC greasy slices. If you are looking for that, try again. This is a hipster pizza joint with prosciutto and figs on the menu. It is amazing but not where you would go if you're craving traditional pizza. I love 7th market in general and this is a great little place. Do watch out: they close early on weekdays so dinner is an early bird special kind of thing."}
{"text":"I hate to rain on the parade of 5 stars, but I was not impressed with my pizza.  I ordered for delivery through foodie call and had a custom pizza made of goat cheese, proscuitto, and arugula - my go to. The pizza came within the expected time frame (45 minutes) and I was excited to give it a try.  The first red flag (you can see by the picture) is all the toppings were plopped in the center. Who likes eating their pizza with no toppings on the outside and then mounds of it on the other side? I spent the next 5 minutes redistributing the toppings so it was evenly dispersed throughout the pie. Second, where was the proscuitto?! There were tiny cut up bits of what tasted like ham sprinkled on top, but definitely not the thin slices of salty, savory proscuitto deliciousness I was expecting.  The ancient grain crust, however, was very good and I also enjoyed the brown sugar cinnamon dipping sauce that came with it. I'm willing to give Pure Pizza another try...but I'll surely be there in person to voice my criticisms."}
{"text":"Let me start with a couple of disclaimers - I was born and raised in Naples, Italy (the birthplace of Pizza), I travel extensively (and thus try food all over) so I know what I'm talking about, and last this is not a universal pizza review but it is relative to the category Pure Pizza belongs to (otherwise I would have to take in account price, etc. which it will make it too complicated). When I think of Pizza in the US I can identify three main categories: The traditional American-Style Pizza, Thicker crust, with thick tomatoes sauces, many cooked toppings, garlic and onion in almost every flavor with variations such as thinner crust and different cooking methods (gas, coal, wood fire and electrical), the Chicago-style deep dish pizza, with a thick layer of meat, very thick, rich in toppings, especially cheese, resembling a stuffed pizza and the Neapolitan Style, wood or coal fired pizza, thin crust, oily, typically fresh and sometimes uncooked ingredients (prosciutto, arugula, cherry tomatoes) or the traditional margherita with blended peeled tomatoes and mozzarella or water buffalo mozzarella. Although tastes varies depending sometimes what you are used to eat, where you grew up and so on what I can say about Pure Pizza is that it will satisfy all the categories as their pizza is a wonderful combination of American traditional crust (I'll get to the sprouted crust later) with a perfect mix of farm-fresh ingredients. I tried 4 different ones so far, and from the simplest one, to the topping rich one I was caught by surprise to each Pizza's addicting flavor. I live in an area where there are many pretentious little local Pizza places and Pure Pizza would blow them out of the water and I'm not kidding. Most of the places I've tried either the crust is too thin and cooked in colder oven and thus too crispy, or they have too much garlic and onion (covering all other flavors), or they either have too little toppings or they have too many toppings, or the oven is too hot and thus they are burned on top. Pure Pizza is the perfect combination instead, you will taste the fresh toppings, you will not taste canned food (at least in the 4 I've tried), the crust in not too thick, not too thin, the amount of toppings is just right, the oven is at a temperature that doesn't burn the toppings or makes it crispy on the bottom. Another distinguish factor is that you will get your Pizza in a record time, still sizzling, even if there is a really long line. No cold pizza, no going back to work late. A little suggestion: they do need to hand out numbers to customers that are visible on the table though so that when the pizzas are ready the servers won't have to scream numbers hoping people will remember theirs. Lastly sprouted crust: in my opinion anything but a white crust is a crime, however I was with other people at the table and one of the pizzas was with sprouted crust and they forced me to try it. Well, I was totally and utterly surprised, my main concern is that the sprouted flour tends to be tasteless, but this wasn't the case at all! I even dipped the crust in their fantastic local \"spicy\" honey! Well done Pure Pizza, I'm looking forward to try all of your other pizza on the menu (I think the pulled pork is next, a little flavor from the south)."}
{"text":"Customer appreciation my a**! Stopped here a while back to pick up a pizza and salad from them but when I checked in [as I was leaving the marketplace] I was then given this offer for FREE garlic knots. Came back today to claim it and I was fed a BS excuse that I would have to buy something in order to receive them. Mind you, it's NOT noted on their offer at all [usually any BOGOF offers through Yelp are clearly identified] and I had already purchased something a while back to even get this \"free\" offer! I don't condone shady business practices of extorting as much $$ from customers as possible so this place is permanently blacklisted from my pizza choices now. I've upload 2 photos of their \"freebie\"."}
{"text":"Ok, can't believe I'm so late to the party, but really glad I finally made it! Hubby and I came here to try it out based on several recommendations and it did not disappoint.   Sarah was our server and she was attentive and great the whole time! So were all the other servers - everyone helped each other.  We tried the Lulu's pizza and garlic knots. Do not leave here without trying the garlic knots - yummy!! The pizza has hamburger and pimento cheese and is amazing! I will have a difficult time branching out to try others but I'm going to attempt it!  Go ahead and treat yo'self to pizza soon at Pure on Central!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my mom over the long weekend. We decided to make our own small pizza and then share a Greek salad. The salad was fantastic! The feta was high quality and the greens were clearly fresh. The dressing was tasty. The arugula was a different spin to my typical idea of a Greek salad but I liked it. The pizza was good! The crust was tasty and perfect texture wise. The toppings were clearly fresh. My only complaint was the pizza either needed to be cooked more or have less cheese on it or something. The middle part of the pizza was soggy and soupy (still tasty nonetheless)."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. I LOVE pizza, but this was bland. I tried the 5 cheese, and it did not have much cheese. Also tried the T-Rex and it was a little better. The pizza is VERY thin, so you need a lot to fill up. The honey for dipping crust was the best part, but still nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We used a \"yelp\" certificate and were not disappointed.  Service was good as was the pizza - we got a meat pizza (can't remember the exact name - but know it was meat because that is all my husband orders) - crust was just right.  Also ordered pulled pork sandwich and one other item - sandwich maybe but everything was really good and prices were very reasonable too.  Nice little place tucked away inside the 7th St. Mkt."}
{"text":"The lady who works at the counter is always really cool. The prestige farms chicken sandwich is my go-to (I always sub the goat cheese for feta and leave the basalmic onions off). They always give you a healthy portion of salad as a side with sandwiches. I also love how everything is always so fresh."}
{"text":"My fav pizza place in Char.  All local produce and ingredients.  The local honey infusions for your pizza are amazing.  Nicole is the best server.  Great food!"}
{"text":"The local mushroom pizza was very good. Nice crispy crust, and meaty, delicious mushrooms in generous proportions. The Greek salad on the side was only ok. The balance of greens to mixins was all off - way too much feta and onions and olives. The prices are a shade high, but the Yelp 50 percent off deal took the sting away. I would come back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Great place, small and cute, and nice/fast service. The calzone was really good and very cheesy 8/10"}
{"text":"Well Pure Pizza is another place that falls in the category of \"I finally had to buy a living social to try\".  Apparently, I need the motivation of an expiring coupon to help me eat some pizza that I know is going to be great.  As per usual, I am all over a wild mushroom pie like a dog in heat.  I chose the sprouted crust and let me tell you, it was the perfect combo with the earthy goodness of the shrooms. Others at the table had margherita and another pie that I can't recall at the moment. Both the other ones were on regular crust, which was also delicious, but I can't get over the sprouted crust.  I look forward to many a return visit.  Oh they also have local craft beer which is always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Great staff. The calzone was exceptional. Very busy with kids day, but I thought it was fun. Love this place. Very friendly place."}
{"text":"Everyone was telling me this pizza was delicious!!  I just wasn't paying attention, I went yesterday for a job, it was our fourth stop and we had been eating all day.  So, you can imagine I wasn't thinking how delicious this might be or having the excitement of a fresh pie coming my way!    We tried The Chorizo, it was so unique.  It was like a street taco, thin crust topped with cheese, chorizo, cilantro, tomato, raw red onion and a little radish.. it was an explosion of flavor.  Just the perfect mix of hot food, with crisp toppings and tiny amount of spice. Well balanced, you just wanting to keep eating it, to keep getting the wave of flavors.  Local sourced ingredients, friendly service + delicious product. And did I mention beer? They have a five or six local beers on tap.  Good times.  Check times in the evening because it closes when the Market closes."}
{"text":"Went to try this place at the advice of friends. I was enjoying the taste of the chorizo Pizza when suddenly I saw not one but 3 hairs on my food. I was so mortified almost vomited. I brought the issue to the staff who scolded me for wasting food. I will not be returning!!!"}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars based on deliciousness, but I had to take 1 star away because of the price. The only thing I've had here is their pizza and it's great. We have to modify our pizza to make it vegan and that's where the dollar signs start adding up. They charge $1 to $1.50 per topping and we added 5 toppings. We almost doubled the price of the pizza in toppings! But I'm more than happy to pay extra at a place that offers Daiya vegan cheese.  Other reasons I love this place: it's in 7th Street Public Market, it's right off the light rail, it shares a space with my favorite coffee and vegan cupcake place. We can easily spend a couple hours here eating and people watching."}
{"text":"Absolutely found our pizza spot ..atmosphere was excellent ..our server Ian..was great the garlic knots r my fav..along with the white pizza..also the chef came out talking to us which is nice .we didn't get her name but thank you.."}
{"text":"While checking out the new 7th Street Market, we decided to have lunch there. Pure Pizza it is! The setup is nice; you order & pay at the same place & everything is made right there in plain view.   And the choices...you have plenty! They offer several tasty options for specialty pizzas, but you can make your own as well.  They also offer options for salads, but you can make your own, too.  We decided to go with the 10\" Pepperoni Supreme with the original crust (you can also choose whole wheat crust), which gave us four pieces total - & nice sized four pieces at that. I love that they use local ingredients.  The employees are friendly & attentive...& quick. We didn't have to wait long to get out pizza.  It was hot & fresh & ooooh....they give you a small container of honey for the crust! It's the little things! The pizza was delicious. The crust wasn't extremely \"dough-y\", which is good.  Seating is plentiful, but you're sharing that common area with the other vendors - so beware, it may get busy.  They have a cooler full of drinks...soft drinks, wine, the yummy Dr. Brown sodas, & water, among other choices.  I'm really pleased with Pure Pizza & will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my lunch go to spot . i love that you can watch as the put your pizza together where it becomes a masterpiece. The honey for the crust is a must ... Oh yeah and they always have fruit infused water...love it"}
{"text":"After all of my camping out at 7th Street Market, I finally made it over to Pure for lunch. After seeing multiple delicious pizzas make their rounds throughout the market to tables seated with happily expectant guests, the time was nigh.  Hanging out on a Saturday morning at the market is great. Tons of hustle and bustle. Hungry folks exploring the various vendors and stands. We enjoyed the morning crowd and had an early lunch.   My wife ordered the mushroom on the sprouted ancient grain crust and I ordered the chorizo pie on the traditional white crust. The mushroom had incredible, robust aromatics. Local shitaki mushrooms and a nice whisper of truffle. The crust is thin and chewy with tons of grainy flavor. That subtle truffle oil flavor....heaven. The chorizo was great. I appreciated the lime wedge to squeeze over the pie. It added the needed sourness to enhance the other savory flavors. I enjoyed chorizo, but the mushroom definitely took first prize of the two. Easily one of the best craft pizzas I've had in the QC.  They also have some great drink choices. Ting? I haven't seen this except at Jamaican restaurants and ethnic markets! How cool! I LOVE Ting. I used to drink it as a kid. It's a nice, perky flavor and works well with the pizza.   Price point is very fair for the craft they churn out, they bring the pizza to you where ever you are in the market, and you can even custom your pie to the world's end. I'm so stoked this place set up in the 7th Street Market!  Very much looking forward to going back. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My wife and I swung in this place tonight for the first time. We've been driving by it for a while now and figured we'd finally stop then. We got there about 15 minutes before they were going to close and they were nice enough to still seat us. My wife had the Panini and I had the barbecue pizza. We are both extremely impressed with the quality of the food, The presentation and the great taste. The waiter was very friendly, and did not pressure us to hurry up and eat and leave. Something that happens to us way too often because we are usually eating late at night. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Friendly attentive staff and delicious vegan pizza. Will be back again."}
{"text":"So, I've to this place a couple of times, LivingSocial coupon in hand, because they have gluten-free pizza, which the beau needs. The verdict: You NEED this pizza in your life!  One of my biggest dislikes about pizza in general is how greasy it usually is. Heavy, sits like a brick, makes you feel squicky for the rest of the day. Not so for Pure Pizza! It was light, airy, and surprisingly grease-free like I have never seen before. I could eat until I'm full and not feel totally disgusting afterward. Which I totally did.  Their gluten-free dough option is quite fluffy and holds up well. It even has an interesting whole-grain sort of taste that quickly grows on you. As someone who typically eats regular glutenous bread, I actually really like it.  Without a doubt, the Deconstructed Pulled Pork pizza is the BEST. God, I'm craving it as I type. The crispy, salty pork with the crunchy, sweet slaw on top of that soft, cheesy bread? I could eat it every day. I don't even usually like slaw. This stuff is seriously fresh. I can't get over it. The T-Rex is also a tasty option for you carnivores out there. It's positively sprawling with delicious meats and won't leave you disappointed.  The only complaint I have is that the employees are a bit aloof and not very friendly. But I can get over that, for the food. Pure Pizza is more like a savory pastry rather than an artery-clogging guilt machine. They've got a return customer for sure.  Be sure to get your parking ticket validated! The machine is over by the bulletin board near the door to the parking garage."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch at Pure Pizza. The guys behind the counter was super cool and very accommodating. I can't eat cow cheese so they left off the Parmesan of my garlic knots and subbed goat cheese on my pizza. Everything was amazing. Bonus the knots were free because I checked into yelp. They even gave me a few more knots because I was nice about them opening a few minutes late. The pizza crust and knots were light and crisp. I also had a salad which was a little pricey but a fresh accompaniment to the pizza. I had a meat pizza called the T Rex which was very delicious. All of the meats complimented the airy crust without overwhelming it. The public market has many choises for lunch but I am very glad I picked Pure Pizza."}
{"text":"For Vegans this place is amazing ! I had the Vegan Garlic Knots and the Marinara which was really good, mine were a little to garlicky but idc. They were prepared for all my questions about eggs, honey, sugar and were polite with me asking them couple more times to make sure. I ordered the 10 inch Vegan Mar- pizza that was a speciality pizza and added Vegan Cheese it was amazing !!! Will be coming back again and ordering this for some movie nights. The servers were well knowledgeable and understand what I was asking for. VEGAN FRIENDLY!!!"}
{"text":"My husband came home talking about an amazing pizza inside 7th street market. Apparently, it was so good he felt obliged to take me here the following day. We ordered half chorizo and half slap yo mama lasagna pizza, a 10\" cheese and garlic knots.   The woman running the counter was so friendly and helpful. She answered our questions and have recommendations.   I found a table while my partner ordered.  We waited a few minutes and they brought out the knots first followed with pizza a few minutes later.   The pizza was really good! The chorizo had such great flavors going on and the lasagna actually tasted like lasagna. Weird. I feel like that's a line from Willy Wonka. \"The snozberries taste like snozberries!\"   Anyway, overall it's a great little place to get delicious pizza in the market. They offer deals through Groupon and Yelp although we didn't use them. It's very casual and laid back atmosphere. Although if you want a table during peak times you might be out of luck. It gets busy. Like really busy during lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to Pure Pizza twice now and could eat there everyday and probably never get sick of it.  The first time I went I had the Wild Mushroom and fell in love. I'm a sucker for truffle oil and that paired with Cottonmill Farms Oyster mushrooms, Grande mozzarella cheese and Bianco-Dinapoli organic tomato sauce... delicious.  After eating there the first time I started reading about Pure Pizza, how their crust was made, where their ingredients come from and fell more in love with each sentence I read.  You've really got to read about their pizza (http://www.purepizzaclt.com/about-our-pizza) and just go try it for yourself.  Yesterday, I took my Mom there and she had the Deconstructed Pulled Pork (Dan the Pig Man pulled pork, Grande mozzarella cheese, house made cilantro lime cole slaw. Topped with a Secret Sauce) and I forced myself to switch it up and get The Chorizo (Chorizo, tomatoes, fresh organic shaved radishes, chopped onions, cilantro, and lime juice). Needless to say, there were no left overs.  Both times I got my boyfriend a standard Pepperoni to go. I was hesitant since he's usually not into a \"better option\" pizza, but he loved it as well.  Go, right now. What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"The food was good! The atmosphere was a lot noisier that we expected.  Good for letting children run about, but it shares a large warehouse-type space. Only a short walk from Discovery Place, which is where we were heading afterward."}
{"text":"Apparently I just need to try the pizza. I got a calzone because I was feeling poor and didn't want to spend $14 on a pizza. The calzone was good, not the best I've had. The worst part is how difficult it was to eat because the the plastic fork and knife provided. It was impossible to cut. I eventually gave up and used my hands. The whole experience gets 3 stars, but I will be back to try a pizza, and I will update my review at that time."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had in a long time! I think it's the crust! Or maybe it's the fresh ingredients! Or the sauce! Hell, I don't know which factor it is. I just know that it's hella (it's a Cali thing, sorry) good! We've been in Charlotte for almost a month and we've already been here three times. We usually get a medium custom pizza ($15.95) with cheese and jalapenos. The crust is thin and chewy-ooey goodness. They even give you a sample of honey to dip your remaining crust in. One sample had red peppers or cayenne in the honey which gave it a little zing to the sweetness.   The staff is friendly and the food comes out extremely quick considering that they make each one custom. I love the location as well. It's located at 7th Street Market, which is one of the Lynx stations, and it's also just a quick walk from Times Warner Cable Arena.    I remember the first time he ordered a pizza here. We took it to go since we already had dinner and he just wanted it for a snack for later. He had a slice right when we got back to the hotel and ended up falling asleep from food coma. He woke up to one slice left since, while he was sleeping, I had discovered how good it was. I couldn't stop myself from eating it all except for the last slice. Lala-oopsy! I think we're upgrading to a large next time ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered the country ham pizza pie, 8\" and my boyfriend got the 8\" bbq chicken. It was ok- but not my favorite pizza in town. The Caramelized garlic added a nice flavor and the country ham was good. Only downfall is that the 8\" pie left me hungry and it was expensive.... $30 for 2 8\" pizzas and 2 cans of soda. The 7th street market is a great environment, very convenient."}
{"text":"People in Charlotte go absolutely crazy for this place. I thought it was good but not on the level that I was expecting given the hype.   I got the Geno D's deli pie. The ingredients tasted fresh and high quality. However, it didn't have sauce on it which I thought was incredibly odd. I mean, I know certain types of pizza don't come with red sauce but I assumed a more traditional pizza like this one would. It was still enjoyable but I like sauce so I felt like not having it really took away from the pizza.   The service at this place was really good. Our waitress was very friendly and I love that they give you honey to dip your pizza crust in (try the spicy honey!). Next time I go, I'll specifically ask for sauce and maybe then I can bump up my rating."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to hed up to the 7th Street Market for quite some time, and I finally made my way out last weekend. I took the Light Rail up because the train doors open up to the doors of the market. I walked around the market for a bit before deciding on Pure Pizza.  You order at the register and get a number to put on your table. There really weren't too many available seats inside, but luckily there were plenty of empty tables outside along 7th street.   I got the chicken sandwich and my mom got the caprese sandwich. Both were absolutely delicious. The chicken sandwich came with chicken, arugula, tomato, balsamic onions, and goat cheese. The caprese sandwich has tomato, mozzarella, palermo sauce, and balsamic vinegar. They were both very filling. The bread was maybe a bit too thick for me personally - my mom ate the second half of her sandwich open-faced to cut down on how much bread she was eating.   I would love to return to try more of the sandwiches and actually try the pizza this time!"}
{"text":"If you want good Pure Pizza, go to the Central Ave location.  The pizza at the 7th Street Market is very, very flimsy. You can barely pick it up without it falling over like a wet noodle.  Also, they used so much flour on the pizza that by the time we finished, our hands AND clothes were a mess.  Lastly, the flavor, or lack thereof, was non-existent, umm bland. It's not worth the time or money. Do yourself a favor and satisfy your hunger elsewhere."}
{"text":"The pros: The vegan cheese is great which is a huge plus for my lactose intolerant self. Vegan cheese can be hit or miss and this one certainly hit.  The atmosphere is cool, sort of shabby chill in a way. It reminded me of a lot of places I went to growing up in Asheville.  The price wasn't bad at all.  Our server was ok- she seemed busy but I could tell she really did intend for us to have a good experience.   The con: Went I went to use the restroom I noticed only two choices: unisex and women. I looked around and just couldn't find a men's. Now if I missed it please let me know and I'll edit this post; however, it didn't seem there was one. I can understand attempting to be inclusive of all people as the sign in the unisex restroom said, but I can't get down with being inclusive by excluding other people. If you insist on having a women's room and a unisex room please offer men the same courtesy."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I ate the same pizza as the other people who left reviews? Ordered garlic knots and a med 1/2 pep supreme and  1/2 bacon. The bacon was totally raw, they forgot the peperoncinis and the pizza (and garlic knots) were incredibly grease soaked. Brought the raw bacon to their attention and they said it comes in pre cooked. I'm telling you the bacon looked raw, was totally limp and slimy. This was not a good pizza.  In regard to the owners reply - your staff explained that the bacon comes in precooked so you should educated them not me on your process. Regardless how you prepare it - not good.   Secondly, yes a review can be damaging but that's what this forum is for - to tell about your experience and mine was not a good one.   Lastly, you should have left it at offering a redo but then following up with a lecture on my opinion and stating what your staff said left me with a 2nd bad impression."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in this pizza. I got the large Lil Weezy Five Cheezy and it was just awful. The secret sauce was flavorless and you could barely taste any of the different cheeses that are supposed to be on the pizza. There were also huge burn bubbles throughout the pizza crust. The basic crust combined with a very thin layer of the cheese and the very bland secret sauce left me not impressed."}
{"text":"Quick and convenient, fresh and tasty, and served piping hot.  I ordered the wild mushroom pizza and while munching on it, watched a video about their local vendors.  It was nice touch for them to not only say \"locally sourced\" and \"good for ya\", but to film a visit to a mushroom grower in Locust, NC is pretty cool.  Yes, they are a little pricey, but dang, great food IS gonna cost some extra change.  Keep up the good work, Pure Pizza--you honor your name."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've found in Charlotte. Traditional thin Napoli style crust. You can taste the quality and freshness of the ingredients. The restaurant itself is a cute converted house, it's relaxed and welcoming. The music was cool and added to the laid back atmosphere. Service was outstanding!  We started with some garlic knots and a caprese salad. Caprese was impressive, perfectly ripe tomatoes with mozzarella, finished with top notch olive oil and balsamic reduction, and a hint of sea salt which gave flavor and texture.  Then moved on to a pizza with pepperoni with spicy peppers and another pizza with country ham and roasted garlic.  We took a calzone home for later. Everything was great. Definitely will be visiting regularly."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the southeast! My favorite is th T- Rex! The servers are always really accommodating and I enjoy every meal I eat there! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Creative menu, great people, fun setting.  We lunkheadedly ordered something we just didn't want, and the folks made us a new pie, no problemo. It was yummy."}
{"text":"Pure Pizza is one of the more unique venues in town. It is inside a pleasant old house and it makes dynamic use of the space. (This space was used by Lulu in the past.)  Pizzas here are delightful and attractive. Tasteful, tasty and they also smell great. I prefer the full-size, dine-in pizzas, and they offer personal size pizzas also..  If the owners are listening: I think you should be open on Sunday.  Consider this: Super Bowl Sunday and New Year's Day (also on Sunday this coming year) are the top two days for pizza sales in the USA. And as of now, you will be CLOSED for both of them.  Also, you are next to a new apartment building, and there are more apartments being built this year next to them. These are apartments, full of people with an affinity for Sunday pizza. (I am one of them.)  Pure Pizza is too often empty when I walk past."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Get the Slap Yo Mama Lasagna Pizza. You won't be disappointed. Trust me."}
{"text":"Two of my favorite worlds have combined: ancient grains and locally sourced food and PIZZA!!! Their pizza is out of this world. I have tried about 5 different pies and each was better than the next. The best was one I wasn't sure about: the pulled pork. AMAZING! Welcome to Charlotte, Pure Pizza!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Charlotte. I went to their uptown location only whenever I was working in the area so I was really happy when this location opened.   Their pizza is really awesome. Not too saucy or dry. I love a basic pepperoni but I add garlic to it. The service is always nice and checks up on me. I go back often."}
{"text":"Yum! We ventured out to pure Pizza today around 630 and were probably seated. The place is pretty small but cozy but cozy. You may have to wait a few minutes for a table. It took us probably 10 minutes to figure out what we wanted to order because we were trying to decide whether we wanted to do the special which was A one topping pizza with a pitcher of beer for $33 ( fridays and I think Saturday's only) or try one of the specialty pizzas. Our waitress was very patient with us while we asked lots of questions.We ended up trying the not yo mamas lasagna pizza with pepperoni and the Lulu without jalapeño. The Lulu pizza was good, but I preferred the not yo mamas lasagna pizza. It was delicious! The crust is crispy yet fluffy and has a good bite to it. They also give you honey to dip your crust in which I thoroughly enjoyed. You can bet that will be back!"}
{"text":"Firstly, pure pizza is in an adorable marketplace and is now my favorite lunch area. There are a bunch of different choices of restaurants near it, all looking delicious and super hip.   I got all of the yelp deals available before ordering: 10 for 20$ and checking in for free garlic knots.  Even with my 20$ credit, I paid an extra 10$ for 2 pizzas and 2 waters.  So far, 30$ for 2 people worth of food is a little steep. But then the food came out and our pizzas were bigger than expected. We barely finished half of all of the food we ordered and took the rest of it home, absolutely stuffed.   The pizzas were pretty good. Slap-yo-mama lasagna pizza didn't quite live up to its awesome name (not to say it was bad, just not exceptional) but the BBQ was freaking amazing. I wish I didn't have two pieces in my sitting so I could have taken more of it home. Btw that pizza is just as good cold as it is hot.   And lastly, the garlic knots were free. Do I even need to say more?   Warning: lunch time gets busy and it gets hard to find a seat! Be prepared to wait around with your food for someone to graciously stand up and free up a table."}
{"text":"Pure Pizza uses fresh ingredients.  That is a huge plus.  The downside is this makes it the most pricey pizza that I've ever purchased.  The Porky Pie was delic :)  They do have sandwiches as well & have tried the pulled pork w/the slaw.  This was quite tasty.  Suggestion - eat the pizza warm for the crust to be the thin & chewy vs. the end part of the crust being impossible to chomp into to.  When ordering from the menu posted online, ask as some of the menu items are not as described on the online menu."}
{"text":"They had all different kinds of gluten free pizza. I got the buffalo chicken and it was delicious. I also tried the caprese salad which was amazing.   The water was in a pitcher on the table and was warm and service was relatively slow, regardless of us being the only ones in the restaurant.  Overall, the food was great and gluten free, but some minor issues prevented me from giving it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Short trip to CLT but got to check out 7th St Market.  We had dinner at Pure Pizza and it was great! We got the deconstructed pulled pork pizza and greek salad.  Salad was great, very fresh!  Pizza was also great and something out of the norm.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the 7th Street Market location to grab some pizza and beer. I was looking for a slice but figured a 10\" Mediterranean pie (mozz, tomato, onions, spinach, olives, and feta) and a Legion Path to the Darkside would suffice.  Pizza was solid as was the people watching. After tip, my personal pie and a beer ran me $23 which was absolutely nutty but I suppose the Market knows they've got a captive audience."}
{"text":"Great, low-key pizza joint in Plaza Midwood. Fresh ingredients and fast service will make me a regular! Check in on Yelp to get a free order of garlic knots."}
{"text":"I have to admit i have been thinking about this pizza since i had it for the first time a few days ago. It was that good. Had the Slap Yo Mama Lasagna add Pepperoni, took it to-go, stuck it on the pizza stone at home for a few min and all i can say is damn that was one good pie. The crust was excellent. Thin and crispy with a nice flavor and not too doughy. Really good when dipped in the honey they toss in the box. The toppings and sauce actually tasted like lasagna and they use the large pepperoni. Its a win-win. I consider myself  a pizzaterian and i have to say this is one of the best pizzas i have had in awhile.  It really is amazing how much more flavor comes through when fresh ingredients are used. Price was a little steep so i wont be able to chow down here on the reg but i definitely look forward to anytime i can swing it. If you appreciate a nice, fresh and creative pie you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Three years and a hundred plus reviews later, Pure Pizza is going strong.  We stop in occasionally when going to an event uptown.  The food is just as good as it was when they opened and the beer selection is a nice addition.  It's worth a visit, but since they are in 7th Street Market, they close early."}
{"text":"Great local ingredients, great owner and staff.  I love their pizza flavors and salads.  I like that you can get a sprouted grain crust - it's delicious.  We've been coming here since they opened and we could bike there.  Now they have another location in Plaza Midwood and we love going there too since it's close to where we live.  Please check this place out - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Farm-to-fork fresh and SO tasty! I went in with a Groupon in hand and left extremely satisfied. We had the BBQ Chicken Pizza, Arugula Salad and OMB Copper on draft. The pizza crust is thin, chewy and absolutely delish. Toppings are piled on heavy but thats just fine by me. I'll eat them off my plate with a fork, no problem ;) Without a deal, the prices are a bit on the high side. You're paying for the farm-to fork quality here.   With or without a deal, I shall return. It's that good.  Validated parking available for 7th street garage."}
{"text":"My son and I are in town for a football game (go Jackets!) and stopped in for dinner.  The T-Rex is simply one of the best pizzas we have ever had.  Super thin crust, fresh ingredients, and excellent pizza.  This would be my pizza joint if I lived in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Juli, you and your staff are rock stars!!!  The food, the service, the homey ambiance, and art on the walls from local creative geniuses, to the fact that everything about Pure Pizza stands as a welcoming environment to everyone, without exception. This is how it's done!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza. Check in on Yelp for free garlic knots. My only complaint, they won't give you a box to take over any left over pizza. Really? They can't just give you a box. Easy solution though, just order your food to go."}
{"text":"I had this pizza for lunch the other day while in the market with a friend. It was my first time eating it and I was so surprised when they give you little cups of honey with your order without you even asking! It was local honey and it was delicious but not really my thing on pizza. We had the margherita and it was good, I wish that it had more cheese and it really could have used like three times the basil but the flavor was good and I am picky when it comes to pizza sauce."}
{"text":"The trips to Pure just keep getting better! Service has gotten extremely friendly and they now have $1 Copper pints on Monday nights. There's also a Yelp check-in for free Garlic knots. The dipping honey comes in multiple flavors and is a nice touch!  The only recommendation I'd make would be to switch from paper plates for the large pizzas to some type of other plate (like the pie plates the individual pizzas come on). Not a deal breaker though.   Looking forward to regular Monday visits!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Pure Pizza! It reminded me of the quaint spot I used to love in Gainesville while I was in college and the food was top notch. I had the the Lil Weezy Five Cheesey which was the perfect combination of cheese. Anything with goat cheese has my heart, honestly. Everything tasted fresh and our waitress was so hospitable even though we went with a large group + kids on a Saturday night. I run marathons to justify eating an entire pie of pizza and surely, this will be my go-to place moving forward."}
{"text":"Great pizza and it's consistent. Love the specials and the honey that comes with the pizza for dipping the crust. They support local businesses so that's a bonus!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Popi brunch pizza with egg, chicken and cheese on gluten free crust. The crust was good and crispy, but I was disappointed I couldn't add bacon since bacon makes everything better! The egg was minimal on my pizza, but my friend got the central brunch sandwich and it looked amazing and came with a side salad."}
{"text":"Love the pizza!  They use a thin crust style that is delicious.  I'm really fond of the sprouted grain crust.  My wife got a sandwich and the focaccia bread was incredible."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance of this place even at 2p! I can tell it's REALLY dope at night though!! Specials daily & BOGO beer ?? I'm DEFINITELY coming back!"}
{"text":"Another 7th Street Market vender that is great. Awesome pizzas. The ingredients are so fresh and the cheese just falls off the pizza. When ever I'm in Uptown during lunch I make sure that I stop and a grab a cheese pizza for like $5. They are so good they have spoiled me for other pizza places. It's great place and you should make sure you go there. They also have local beer too. The crew of Pure are friendly and love what they do. I have family members in other state craving their pizza after one visit.  So that should tell you that you need to make a visit right now."}
{"text":"I had the tuck and rolls, they were fresh and delicious. The service is always excellent. Friendly relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza and garlic knots. We were very pleased with both. It's a great healthy alternative. The staff was very friendly. I'm happy we tried it when we visited Charlotte."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my calzone and Caesar salad from Pure. Excellent quality. I'm looking forward to returning to Charlotte so I can try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"The pizza is definitely worth the hype! Very tasty and clearly with high quality ingredients and amazing crust. We had a large pizza with half chorizo and half pepperoni supreme, it was so nice to try two different options on one pizza and made compromise much easier! The garlic knots are to die for with fresh garlic and plenty of Parmesan.  The service was quite slow as it was a busy night and they were short staffed but we will definitely be back. I didn't get any pictures because we ate too quickly!"}
{"text":"Consistently quite and courteous service, even during the weekday lunch rush. The garlic knots are to die forth, with fresh garlic and basil topping tender yet crispy dough. The mushroom pizza is good but not as exciting as I had hoped. The smoked salmon pizza is a bit strange but amazing, a really different flavor combo for a pizza but similar to a bagel and lox. If you're feeling adventurous I would highly recommend the smoked salmon!"}
{"text":"In the 7th Street Market (under parking deck). My favorite is the mushroom pizza. Good for lunch or take home after work. Pizza's made fresh but only takes 10 mins or so."}
{"text":"Very good mushroom pizza! I park for work in the deck above this spot & it's nice to pick up a pizza on the way home!"}
{"text":"Their buffalo knots and their pizza make this one of the best pizzerias I've been to in CLT, highly recommend this."}
{"text":"House hunting is hard. That's why after doing a house drive-by, my fiancee and I swung by Pure Pizza to refuel. A very cool place which I believe was build in an old house. Very compartmentalized, so even in the biggest of the dining areas, you're still in a small area.   The food dominates. For a legitimate meal, The Pizza Peel and Pure Pizza are neck and neck for best pizza in Plaza, if not Charlotte. My first visit was a quick pick-up and I got \"The Lulu\" which has jalapenos, bacon, ground beef, tomatoes, and pimento cheese. So good. Like a spicy pimento cheese sandwich with a ground up bacon burger on pizza crust!  This past visit we dined in. They have a lot of local beers, so I asked for a sample of one. Turns out they didn't have any clean sample glasses so our waitress (Sarah) brought out a free half pint for my fiancee (also Sarah) and myself. Sarah (the waitress) was very attentive and helpful. Sarah (the fiancee) and I both had some questions which Sarah (the waitress) answered amazingly. I decided on the \"Pepperoni Supreme\" which WAY exceeded my expectations. Delicious pepperonis, pepperoncinis, pickled red peppers, and (even though it wasn't on the menu) banana peppers.  Cannot say enough good things about Pure Pizza. If you haven't been already, you're really missing out."}
{"text":"This is pizza done right. Not too much sauce, perfect amount of toppings, and the crust is flawless. My favorite is the Pesto Pizza but the Wild Mushroom, Buffalo Chix and Five Cheese are amazing too. This is hands down my favorite place to get a pie in Charlotte. Also, they give you honey to dip your crust in and they have a solid beer selection."}
{"text":"How this place doesn't have 5 solid stars...the pizza, the ingredients, the flavors, and the customer service was on great!!! I couldn't make up my mind all I knew was I wanted their Pizza.  The guy at the counter helped me out....this Pizza was fantastic.   Pepperoni supreme and added arugula & spinach to it and they hooked me up w/free knots per Yelp check in offer. Glad I stood there and checked in.  Pros: great location, free parking w/purchase, pizza crust was awesome and knots were buttery soft.   Cons: none! Do yourself a favor, go earlier than actual lunch time or midday. All pros...no cons.."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the pizza.  I usually just get the plain cheese pizza, it is that good and the crust is perfect.  Nice local microbrew selection... What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Delicious and I love that literally everything in my calzone was local. And plus who puts chanterelle mushrooms in calzones, Come on Now...one star just for that!"}
{"text":"I am SUCH a fan of Pure. I first discovered it when the only location was at 7th street market. Love that you can customize your pizza and the salads are just so fresh and yummy!  Love, love love, the chili-honey dipping sauce - sweet and spicy all at once! I am a vegetarian and they have the best, most fresh pizza I have had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Stopped in the 7th street market for lunch the other afternoon and my wife, son and myself all had an excellent lunch here! My son and I. It got the Hot Italian sandwich and my wife had a calzone. Absolutely delicious and everything was fresh. Service was prompt and courteous. We most certainly will be back and recommend this spot to anyone."}
{"text":"What can I say? That's some good pizza. Definately a must if you're in the Seventh Street Public Market area. I am a huge fan of the Margarita Pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza!  A little pricey but bit tastes good.  The staff could be a bit friendlier... Maybe I've been spoiled coming from New York to the south where everyone seems super sweet... Maybe these folk ain't from around these parts.... But your pizza is good :-). Interesting toppings and suggested  styles.  But I love that they offer honey to dip the crust.  I wouldn't have thought that would work but it totally does.  Can't wait to try the next one"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Charlotte for pizza! Love the farm to fork concept. The T-rex pizza is great for meatlovers. Famers salad is nice also. Located inside 7th street market with free parking validation. Wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special ( any one topping with a drink) I got the chicken topping and I must say it was very delicious ! My food came out in a timely manner as well . I love this location because it is something like large cafeteria setting without the grumpy lunch ladies lol . Will be returning again!"}
{"text":"Here for a conference but snuck away at lunch.  Pure pizza looked great.  I ordered the one with ham, mozzarella and basil.  Unfortunately I asked for the ancient grains crust because its unusual and sounded good.  The overly healthy crust was not to my taste.  Suddenly Gino appeared (I believe he is the father or father in law of one of the owners) and noticed I wasn't eating much.  He immediately asked about the crust and said its not his favorite either.  He insisted on bringing me another pizza with their regular crust (also made from locally ground flour, but the white kind).  The second pizza was really great.  I ate one piece immediately fresh from the oven - awesome- and brought the rest back to my hotel.  heated up in the microwave tonight it was still good for dinner, but of course the microwave removes a bit of crispiness.   The public market is on the small side but the merchants seem sincere and really concerned with good quality local ingredients.   You can also get a nice glass of wine from the little wine bar, which I did, and it makes for a good light meal."}
{"text":"Been passing this place many times. First time here! Thursdays your kids eat free! Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wild mushroom pizza with mozzarella and truffle oil. Six slices. Pure taste bud happiness.  Seventh Street Market is the perfect casual date spot and Pure Pizza's kitchen makes sure to tickle your olfactory senses as soon as you walk through the door. While it was a slow Friday evening when we visited in mid-November before a show at the Booth Playhouse Uptown, there really wasn't any question of whether or not we were going to get some bread and cheese, just a matter of what particular ingredients were going to come on said pie.  A smattering of craft beers on tap, quick table service and reasonable prices. Yeah Pure Pizza!"}
{"text":"If Heaven were a pizza, it would be this pizza.  With honey on the side.  The 7th Street Market is such a neat place to go anyway, but when you go hungry - be sure to eat here!  I've only ever had the T-Rex pizza, because it's SO GOOD.  The crust is crispy and just right.  The T-Rex pizza has all sorts of meat on it (Ron Swanson style). The people are friendly!  Annnnnd they validate parking!  Pure Pizza has never let me down, if you want a good pizza and you're Uptown - this is your spot!"}
{"text":"The \"wild mushroom\" pizza was perfecto.  The truffle oil made it delicious but the oil wasn't overpowering.  I love white pizza and this hit the spot.  Would definitely get this again!"}
{"text":"Pure pizza is purely good! I placed a to-go order for a small chorizo pizza on a Saturday afternoon and was told that there would be a 25 minute wait. I stopped in the nearby Harris Teeter really quick and then made my way down the street to Pure Pizza.   It's a small spot right off Central with a matching small parking lot. When I came in, I was immediately told there was a drag show going on. I'm not sure if these events are regular or not but the news took me by surprise and made me wish I could've stayed!  Given the drag show news, I expected that I would have to wait longer since the entire inside seemed to be there for the show. However, my order was ready and I was out the door. I was surprised by how cozy the inside is, much smaller than I was expecting. There's also a small outdoor patio in front with a couple of tables.  Once home, I unabashedly tore into my pizza. The chorizo, radishes, cilantro, red onion, tomato, and cheese made for a wonderfully harmonious flavor combination. I ate the entire small pizza by myself #noshame. Personally, I found the accompanying honey container to be unnecessary. The pizza was delicious without it but I did dip a piece of the crust into it for good measure.  For a small chorizo 'craft' pizza, it was $13 (which includes tax). Yes, more expensive than your regular chain pizza but, obviously, worth it."}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to LOVE Pure Pizza. I love everything it stands for, with the local ingredients and the laid back vibe. I loved the servers, who were very down to earth and friendly. The only problem, we really did NOT love the pizza. :( The ground beef on my husband's pizza was very bland, even for someone of milder taste. The gluten free crust (which I know can be more difficult to make at times) was totally soggy and lacking in flavor as well.   Two things we did really love were the garlic knots (delicious! coated in real garlic and olive oil) and the salads. The salads were a good size, fresh, and full of delicious flavorful ingredients. They were basically the opposite of the pizza.   I'd consider coming here again, but only for the salads and appetizers and maybe a drink. Definitely not for the pizza.  At the end of the day, if I spend $15+ on a personal pizza, I expect it not only to have top notch ingredients, but to taste delicious too. Walking away from our meal (garlic knots, brussel spouts appetizer, two salads, two personal pizzas, and one beer each) we did not feel like what we got was worth the $90 bill.   If they work on the gluten free crust texture and the flavor of the meat, that would seriously improve things. The vibe of the place is phenomenal, as were the garlic knots and the marinara that came with the knots. The rest just paled in comparison."}
{"text":"The food was simple and well thought out flavors. The brunch menu had something for all. The food was delicious. Small parking lot. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Great for lunch, and located in 7th street market so your companions can choose from sushi or sandwiches if they don't desire pizza.  Pizza is thin(ish) crust.  I've ordered the T-Rex and a basic pepperoni, the T-Rex is awesome.  If the line is long, it takes a while just to order.  For some reason, they are slow at taking orders.  It usually takes 10-15 minutes for them to bring your pizza out to you.  They have various sodas/beers available as well.  They carry some Dr.Brown's soda which is pretty good.  They have complimentary honey dipping sauces for your crust, which are really pretty tasty.  I went with the cinnamon flavor."}
{"text":"We decided Pure Pizza on a recommendation of a friend from NYC that knows the owner.  Glancing thru the website, I was impressed to see the different types of crust and a variety of fresh ingredients!  The veggies in the salad looked like they had been in the garden that morning.  We tried the Caesar and the Farmer's salad- both delicious!  My husband had the pepperoni supreme on regular crust.  He's very particular about his pizza and he absolutely loved it!  I had the she-Rex on ancient grains crust.  It is the best \"whole wheat\" crust I've ever had- not greasy or dry!  The pizza had amazing flavor, topped with the perfect amount of toppings!  The service (Gena) was awesome- so nice, friendly and helpful!    As a wellness coach, I am picky about where I eat out.  I love that the ingredients come from local or organic sustainable farms.  We absolutely loved our first trip to Pure Pizza!  We can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Pure Pizza is a 7th street market staple and rightfully so!! It is delicious. The person taking my order was friendly and the other staff seemed the same way. My order came out quickly (even though it was during lunch rush: ~1 pm); I ordered takeout and it took less than 10 minutes!  As for the pizza itself, it is amazing! I got the Margherita this time (though all their specialty pizzas look delicious... mmm). It's your basic tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil, but Pure Pizza does it so well! The mozzarella and basil are fresh and everything works so well together. The tomato sauce is bursting with flavor, but doesn't overpower the basil and cheese. The dipping oil on the side was a nice touch, too.  I love how Pure Pizza supports local causes, too! That gets 5 stars in my book! To sum it up, I can't wait to come back to Pure Pizza and try another pizza. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great!!! Crust was really good! When they offer you honey to dip the crust in, take it!!! TRY IT!!! We tried the 5 cheese and it was good! Had a nice smoked flavor!!!  Also I just loved it being in the 7th Street Fresh Market! That place in itself was really cool!"}
{"text":"Had a client meet up at the 7th Street Market & got the opportunity to try out Pure Pizza! We had (what I think was called) their T-Rex pizza. It was amazing! Everything they make is so fresh and full of flavor! I loved every bite! The owner is also extremely friendly! Be sure to say hello!"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing , I m a connoisseur of fine pies and was not  Disappointed ! The girlie knots were Delish, service was great . Overall great experience , I will be back !"}
{"text":"I decided to use my Groupon tonight during a wine tasting.  I was not impressed with my pizza.  I was expecting it to look like most of the pictures displayed. Instead I received a very flimsy pizza.   I probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Great pesto pizza. They've been short staffed the few times I've been. I love that they're family owned. They have a good selection of local beers, but didn't have hard cider this time. I will definitely continue to go there."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Stopped by yesterday after reading such great reviews and was definitely impressed. I ordered a small pepperoni supreme and it was delicious. The ingredients proved their authenticity from the first bite. One of the best pizzas I have had in Charlotte.   The only thing keeping Pure Pizza from being one of my regular lunch spots is the price. My small 10\" pizza was $11.95; with a can of Coke my total came out to a little over $14. Worth the money, just not on a weekly basis for me."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!! The best mushroom pizza I ever had , 5 ***** , great place to unwind.  Manager is great too . All the best for Julie   Cy"}
{"text":"I had the bbq chicken pizza for lunch today and it was excellent!!! It is my third time having it. I'm not sure if it's a NC thing or not but they give you a little cup of honey for your crust. Ummmm, it's actually pretty good! In a see of Pizza Hut and Dominoes meal deals you do get a bit of sticker shock at Pure. $11.95 for a small pizza...really? Good price on the beer though, $4 for a 20oz cup:)"}
{"text":"I've always been super impressed with their cleanliness, service and menu. You can tell they use fresh produce from the quality of the food. You can tell they take care of their employees from the quality of their service. Their space is decorated well, in a quirky, shabby-chic kind of way. Plus: they carry vegan cheese and gluten free menu options! Pure Pizza is a gem, and the Plaza Midwood neighborhood is lucky to have them."}
{"text":"I thought that the pizza was very good and I really love the atmosphere of the market. I will be a long time customer here."}
{"text":"Pizza was adequate but if I could, I would give a ZERO rating for customer service. We were visiting from Southern California and my friend's family took us here for lunch. My friend ordered a pizza with goat cheese because it's the only cheese she can have. When it came out with regular mozzarella, she tried to bring it back to the counter, and GENO was so aggressively rude and disrespectful that he had made my friend cry. How he could have the audacity to yell, gesture, snatch the pizza away, and slam it into the garbage like he did was unacceptable and offensive. Only after noticing that he had made her cry did he come out to our table to apologize and offer a gift card. Even if we lived there, he is enough reason to never give Pure Pizza our business again. Thanks but NO thanks.  Also, if you're going to act like that, please stop telling people you are from New Jersey. You are giving all of us a bad name."}
{"text":"Many choices...specialty pizzas or build your own. Great arugula salad! Vegan and vegetarian options abound."}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh and organic. The pizza isn't over cooked like most places. Orders come out quick. The price is a little high for the portions. That's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Never have I ever been let down by these guys. Personal fav: chorizo pizza. Everyone I've met is super friendly. Oh and they're salads are great too!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Eco friendly practices. Pure ingredients. Local. Honestly, it's perfect. Location is dope, too."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. The wild mushroom was full of flavor and a great crust. They use all natural fresh ingredients located inside the 7th Street public market. Enjoyed with a German style Dunkel Beer."}
{"text":"This place is great! Beautiful interior design and art work. But the pizza is delicious! They specialize in farm-to-table and organic ingredients and you can taste the difference. I enjoyed the sprouted grain crust, which is the healthiest option available. For those with gluten sensitivity, I suggest trying sprouted grain products as they aid in the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Although, they cater to anyone with salads and vegan, gluten free, and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Love this place! Bottle of wine with our pizzas-perfect mid-week date night spot. Staff couldn't be friendlier."}
{"text":"I normally do not like to five star something unless I have been at least twice. In this case my friend let me snag a slice of his pizza so I sort of went twice. It was packed on a Friday for lunch when we went. I ordered the chorizo pizza on whole wheat and he ordered the Five cheese. The pizza came out in about 10 minutes, maybe a little longer but not a long wait. It looked beautiful, cooked perfectly and it tasted as good as it looked. Toppings were balanced and nothing overpowered another topping. The crust was very good and filling, the cinnamon honey dipping for the crust was AHMAZING. If I did have a complaint it would be the lack of sauce, maybe it is just the pizza I ordered I could see tomato sauce being awkward with the toppings of this pizza. However, I am a fiend for a good tomato sauce. The five cheese was equally as good. The cheese's were of great quality and stringed for days.   It was hard for me to choose which pizza to order because they have so many inventive selections like Smoked Salmon and pulled pork. I can not wait to try it again."}
{"text":"I dig this spot for lunch. It reminds me of being home in New York. sitting in the 7th street market and taking in the things around you while eating this nearly perfect pizza is heart warming. Almost as good as standing in the streets of NYC with a slice the size of your head on wax paper. Almost. Good job Pure Pizza. Good job!"}
{"text":"I've had serious debates on the best pizza in Charlotte. I don't care what anyone says Pure Pizza is the winner.   We always get take out but the atmosphere is perfect, service is great and the pizza is perfect."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the garlic knots and 5 cheese pizza.  The garlic knots were tasty and a good portion.  The side of marinara was garnished with fresh herbs and Parm cheese and went perfectly with the knots and latter the pizza crust.  The pizza was made perfectly with good crust and a great selection of cheeses.  We really enjoyed the food and the staff was friendly and helpful.  The yelp deals made this a great deal.  Will eat here again!    One note, the 5 cheese isn't sauced with a red base, so if that's what you are wanting Try another pizza from their selection."}
{"text":"Great pizza, very authentic Italian/NYC flavor.  Wasn't a fan of their gluten crust but definitely love the classic.  Their garlic knots & pepperoni rolls are also fantastic."}
{"text":"Dear Chorizo Pizza,    From the moment I saw your picture on Yelp, I knew I had to have you. The attraction was instantaneous and strong. When I finally met you on Saturday, it was MAGIC. Your crust, unique and delicious. I was bedazzled by mounds of chorizo and onions. Your fresh radishes, cilantro and lime only succeeded in fueling my passion. Your flavor was astounding and made my heart pound with excitement. Chorizo Pizza, where DID you come from? My dreams, only I hadn't dreamt you yet. You light up my life and are the wind beneath my wings. Love,  Michael  PS -  I love your Garlic Knots, thanks for the Jam Session and your Yelp deal was the icing on an already beautiful cake!!!"}
{"text":"Wholesome, healthy pizza. Being a NYer, we are automatically considered pizza snobs. I guess the more the review means? Since moving here, I've been on the hunt for a good pizza spot. This place is just it!  Got to taste it during a Yelp CLTmade event and great the background story of how the business started. What an amazing and inspiring story! The more praise does this place get.  Healthy conscious ingredients, that your body and taste buds will love. Locally sourced flavors and add-ons (uhm cloister honey for dipping the crust!-mindblown) chorizo! Meat-lovers and vegetarian options. Gotta love a good place that makes 'junk food' less junk and actual food to nourish your body!  Yep! This NYer found her pizza spot!"}
{"text":"I went there based on reviews on yelp.  I was not let down! I got the wild mushroom personal pie and added spinach and fresh jalapenos on the ancient grains crust. It was amazing. The crust was perfectly cooked and all the toppings meshed well together.  They have many vegan options(daiya cheese). The owner and the other employee there were very nice and friendly.  I will definitely be going back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Ordered a Caprese  pizza. When my order came up I went to add the essentials (cursed red pepper and Parmesan cheese). As I'm adding the crushed red pepper THE LID FELL COMPLETELY OFF. It left a mountain of red pepper flakes on my pizza. I went over to the guy at the counter to explain what happened. As I handed him the shaker he just kind of took it and shrugged.  Whether it was them doing a poor job of screwing the cap on or someone playing a mean joke, it didn't matter. My pizza was ruined. On top of that the employee didn't offer to either remake it or refund me. Poor experience overall :("}
{"text":"Great pizza decent price and the help was super friendly will be back first time in the area"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, great service. We had the T-Rex pizza and it was some of the best pizza I've ever had! Good prices, good service, and a sunny outdoor patio area."}
{"text":"First off I love this market it has so many great places to enjoy including PURE Pizza.  First of I  must say the guy who took my order was very helpful and friendly.  They must have a great business because this might  be the only pizza place I know not open at nights because of the lease where they are at.  So that to me speaks volumes about their product!    I ordered the PRESTIGE FARMS CHICKEN it has grilled chicken, fresh tomato, Lucky Leaf Farm fresh arugula, white balsamic onions, Boskey Acres goat cheese talk about fresh and flavorful I loved every bite of it.  My girlfriend ordered a small MARGHERITA pizza and added bacon for 2 bucks which I was for a small?  Then I saw and tasted the pizza.  This is some of the best pizza I have ever had and for 2 dollars they dont skimp on the toppings they are big pieces of bacon not bits.  I can't honestly wait to go back to Charlotte and eat here talk about top notch with out a doubt.  IF YOU LOVE PIZZA IT IS A MUST GO!!!   I also saw this in another review and am reposting since its so cool!  \"After eating there the first time I started reading about Pure Pizza, how their crust was made, where their ingredients come from and fell more in love with each sentence I read.  You've really got to read about their pizza (purepizzaclt.com/about-o...) and just go try it for yourself.\""}
{"text":"Love the Pizza here, just had a takeout Chicken Jalapeno and a Sausage Mushroom.  I really like there crust and the sauce they put on it. Very good cheese ratio too. I think it could have had a bit more sausage. I love sausage though!  I could eat a slice every day. Garlic Knots are such little delicious treats also. Go you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"As a person who has not been able to go out to a pizza place and order a pizza like a normal person for a few years now due to gradually increasing wheat intolerance, I want to thank this place for existing. Their sprouted ancient grains gluten free crust is not a perfect replica of regular pizza crust (how can it be?) but it is tasty and has a good texture, and holds up to being held in your hand as you chew on a slice. The topping combinations are pretty interesting and everything tastes fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"Pizza today is a tale of two cities- the one ordered en masse for speedy consumption by hungry hordes, the other on a smaller scale, as a chance for food artisans to show their chops, for everything from the crust to the mix of toppings showcased on top.  Pure Pizza, with its focus on locally-sourced ingredients, is new to town but quickly showing great promise amongst the artisan crowd.    Tucked into the 7th Street Market, Pure resembles little more than a food vendor at your local indoor mall, in that there is a counter and a series of glass guards separating you from the \"kitchen.\"  A menu board overhead describes the offerings and options available.  Seating is basic and plentiful in the middle of the market.  A quick look at the menu reveals a number of different pizzas and salads.  Pizzas come in 3 different sizes and in your choice of 2 different crusts- a basic white and a sprouted wheat/ancient grain.  Salads come in a choice of either a large or a small serving.  On my visit, the wife and I opted for a fresh arugula salad with goat cheese and a chorizo pizza on the sprouted wheat crust.  The salad was uber-fresh and bright with flavors.  With a lively lemon vinaigrette, it was like spring in bowl.  One minor quibble- the dressing was so cold the oils were semisolid, so we had to bring that up to temp a bit before pouring it over the salad.  The pizza, though, was brought out fresh from the oven and was worth the trip alone.  The crust had a great combination of crackling on the outside combined with a light and chewy interior.  That's no easy task with whole grains, but they have pulled it off well.  Choirzo was spicy and the cheese was a great contrast to it.  My favorite part?  The pepper-infused honey they give you to dip your crust into.  Unqiue and a great contrast to the savoriness of the pie.  Given that ingredients are farm-to-fork, it just adds to the experience to know you are eating seasonal and local foods that support area farmers.    Though we were stuffed, it was not hard to look up at the menu and imagine some of the other pizzas being equally good.  Everything from a classic margarita to a T-rex for the meat lovers sounded very good and will be worth a future visit.  Even breakfast is not out of the question as they have a smaller menu with 3 different pizzas there- each combining a egg on top of a pizza with as assortment of other ingredients.  Sounds tempting to me.  Given that Pure is right next to a bakery and with an artisnal coffee shop just across the way, you can get you fill and quench your foodie cravings all in one spot.  Combine that with 2 hour validated parking in uptown and you have a winner.  Pure is a welcome addition to the 7th Street Market and they fulfill a unqiue and developing niche in the pizza market.  Not a place to take the family when it's time for a quick dinner out, but a great spot for enjoying locally-sourced food prepared with skill and care.  Pure Pizza is so far pure goodness."}
{"text":"Pure Pizza is a fantastic place for pizza. I love the sprouted grain crust since I'm partial to grainy dough with that kind of consistency. The truffle oil is a wonderful touch on the Wild Mushroom and the garlic knots are huge in addition to being savory and delicious. I can't wait to try the other varieties."}
{"text":"Less than stellar. Tried out Pure Pizza for the first time on a Friday, when they were having a pop-up market.  I was there at 1:00ish, before the 2:00 pop-up. After ordering, I found it strange I had to ask how long, considering I was to go ahead and be seated - but that's extremely minor.  Pizza was brought to me piping hot - but also somewhat burnt.  So after letting my pizza cool, the flavors were just ehhh.  There was just nothing too special that would lure me back again, considering the plethora of other options out there."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for brunch with a Groupon deal. They have a parking lot at the central location. The establishment has an eclectic vibe. The place was probably an old house made a restaurant which was unique and crafty. The food is reasonably priced. The service was good. I had the palmetto sandwich which came highly recommended by the server. It was just okay for me. My friend had a mushroom pizza which was okay for her. We had the garlic knots which came in a set of 4 they were made fresh. We had mimosas which were okay as well. Nothing stood out as delicious or extraordinary. The floor shook tremendously with each step the waitresses took. Overall it was okay but I don't know if I would pay the prices without the groupon deal. I like the fact that they have gluten free options and 100 whole spouted grain. It may be bette in the evening."}
{"text":"Best Gluten free Pizza my wife and I have had in the South!!  Sorry Mellow Mushroom, Pure pizza has you beat! Great crust, great taste and great service!"}
{"text":"Only place worth eating pizza if you are coming from NY/NJ.  I have been here on my last two trips to Charlotte and will keep coming back.  The ingredients are fresh and they even give you some local honey to dip the yummy crust into.  We always get the large to get the true Neapolitan Crust.  What makes this place even more wonderful is we always see the owner working back there with the rest of his team.  This is a labor of love for him."}
{"text":"I can't describe in enough detail how wonderful this place is! My children and I are gluten intolerant and have an allergy to dairy. It is so hard to find great pizza we can eat. We usually have to make it at home. Kind of ruins the pizza night vibe when I have to make it myself, ya know?  We love that they have dairy free cheese! Wow! My kids can actually get a pizza with cheese on it when they go out? Nice! Not only that but the sprouted grain dough (think Ezekiel bread) was so yummy. No thin cracker-like crust which most gluten frees are like. Soft, chewy and delicious.   We had excellent service too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We loved pure pizza!! Great service, great atmosphere, and great food! Definitely planning to return soon"}
{"text":"Love this place and the location on central. The food is always fresh and I love the ancient grain crust. Makes me feel better about pizza. The sauce is perfect!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!  NY native who lived in Italy for years, and this pizza was on par with those pizzas.  I had the \"Slap Yo Mama Lasagna\" pizza and was delicious, will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, unfriendly staff.  Honestly the staff needs to be fired.. they were so rude-the cashier and server bringing food had so much attitude and just looked down on all customers. Ruined my lunch date."}
{"text":"i love this restaurant! i can safely say that they make THE BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER EATEN!!!! it's baked perfectly so the crust is not tough like many other pizzas are and is soft and yummy! they have a wide selection of great pizzas and salads, and you can't beat the free order of garlic knots you get when you check-in on yelp. will definitely return and will look forward to it! and in fact, a lot of their ingredients are organic!! that's wonderful to have a fairly priced pizza place in charlotte that is actually good for you!"}
{"text":"Ok, this review is for the 7th street market location, not the central avenue spot of which I have not visited.  The 7th street market location is their original spot and used to be very good.  The service has diminished considerably the last few times we have been here.  This is the prime example of ownership losing their grip on the managers of a restaurant.  My wife and I visited with a friend on a recent weekday evening, the market was busy but nothing crazy by any means.  My wife ordered a small pizza and so did our friend.  Wife ordered a chorizo pizza, it was OK, very light on the toppings compared to previous visits.  Our friend ordered a build your own with white sauce, it did not come with white sauce.  The person that dropped it off responded with \"it wasn't on the ticket\".  Ok, so no problem, we will walk ourselves up to check with the guy who took the order.  When we did, we got a blank stare, no offer to remake, no offer to do anything for that matter.  Not my kind of service.  I understand mistakes happen, for that I have no problem.  The problem is, you must correct that mistake if you want me to return to your establishment, they did not so that makes my decision easy.  Bottom line for me is, you are serving average pizza, you must make sure it is consistent and correct any mistakes you make, there are plenty of places to get average pizza."}
{"text":"Came here for the wine Wednesday special (1/2 off all bottles) and food of course. My friend and I split a $20 bottle of a red blend, which was half off, so it was a major deal.   I ordered the She-Rex pizza. I really enjoyed this 10 inch pizza with what is basically a salad on top of a pizza so you can trick yourself into thinking it's healthy haha. But underneath is the cheesy bready goodness of a pizza with onions and peppers. Very enjoyable! Plus they brought two little containers of honey to the table, which was meant for putting on your crust. One was traditional honey and the other was cinnamon sugar honey. YUM!  The atmosphere was very country and welcoming. Semi reminded me of a small town restaurant in Italy. They aren't trying to impress you with a fancy ambiance, it's all about the food. Not that the ambiance is bad, but it's not the focus."}
{"text":"7th Street market, what can I say other than I hate that I haven't been sooner?  We went next door to ImaginOn and decided to follow all the other \"cool Yelpers\" review and try Pure Pizza.  WOW, is about all I can say.  You walk up, and the menu is written on a chalkboard and it takes some time to process, the lady at the register was really great about answering questions and suggested that I try the \"Slap yo Mama Lasagna\" which I had on Ancient Sprouted Grain dough.  The pizza came out in record time and was chock full of tasty fare.  Ground beef, mozzarella cheese, basil, onions, and the tastiest damn tomato sauce I have had on a pizza yet.  The ancient sprouted grain dough was flavorful and had a nice rise to it which gave the pizza the right amount of fluff.  I got the small which was plenty and was glad I did.    I like places like this, and hope that it is successful since I will be come a more frequent customer.  It is appealing to me that there are many other neat places to check out while I'm there which makes this experience well worth the trip.  Great stuff Y'all!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the 7th Street Public location and loved the Plaza Midwood one even more! Great atmosphere, great service, and great pizza! Make sure you get honey to dip your crust in! Do yourself and get seated with Kristina. She is the best!"}
{"text":"I took my parents to the market one night to experience what I consider to be an amazing part of Charlotte. While we were there we decided we would grab a pizza to snack on. It was the first time I had ordered pizza from them, as there are so many choices in the market! I have to tell you we all loved it! Loved loved loved! It truly was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Between the crisp crust and the fresh toppings, it was amazing. It's been about three weeks now and we still talk about that pizza like we had just eaten it today! My parents said it's one of the best they've ever had. Without a doubt we will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a Groupon deal, pretty underwhelmed but I have to say it was worth it with the deal. It would't be without.  As a pizza lover, I like my pizza done certain way. I wouldn't send it back if it was done defiantly- every pizzeria has their own style. I got the wild mushroom with an egg on it and I wasn't a big fan of it.  With that being said, it's named Pure Pizza because of their: - Locally and seasonally sourced toppings . - Organically grown California tomatoes. - Finest WI and NC cheeses. - They offer ancient grain dough (100% whole grains without wheat). - Gluten-free dough.  Daily specials: Monday: $1 OMB Copper.  Tuesday: BOGO on pizza. Wednesday: Half Price Bottles of Wine. Thursday: Kids Eat Free. Friday and Saturday: Large (1) Topping Pizza + Beer Pitcher $33  Three and Half Yelps."}
{"text":"As a girl from New Jersey, I love a good pizza. As a girl who loves pizza, I love pesto pizza. This place has it all. Wouldn't get pizza anywhere else in Charlotte. Not to mention the man behind the pizza is pretty awesome as well"}
{"text":"Closed 20 minutes early on a Saturday night, during the Charlotte Criterium bike races. Did not get to try their food. But if a place does not stay open during the posted hours, how do they expect me to do that?"}
{"text":"1st visit and I know I'll return.  Simple menu and ordering process.   We got the 16\" topped as HALF T-Rex & Margherita.  This apparently is not possible nor acceptable at this location. Yep! I know several other Yelpers got half & half many of times but the guy conceded when he realized it was more than me and I just wanted basic.   Anywhoo, the Restaurant Week 30% off via Check-In wasn't available for this location. I had to check in on the Central location to get the discount applied and I couldn't do it via my app because I had already checked in for 7th street so central was deemed too far. Luckily, I had someone just join Yelp so I got it handled via their phone.   They knew about the free Yelp Pizza Knots but didn't seem to know about the 30% off and as the guy with the piercings said: I can't give it if I don't see it. So, I made sure it was got so he could see it.   The crust = 5 stars The half & half = 5 stars The basil is cut into thin strips which I don't care for on pizza so 2 stars. I prefer full basil leaves even freshly turn in my presence as I know the aromatic flavors will pop...anywhoo strips is what it is, here. #notypo I look forward to trying the Mushroom pizza, a calzone (2 top max) and a salad on future trips.   Validating still occurs but we walked then hopped over to Studio Movie Grille.   The sauce is okay.  I love, love, LOVE that they have a running video showing how they source their local products.  I do wish they'd return to offering honey for the pizza crust per the older Yelp reviews (2013 & 2014) but hey maybe I was supposed to request it.  IDK.   They offer an $8 dine-in lunch special. For Uptown that's a deal.  The pizza we had remaining and brought home 5 hours laters - held up pretty well and in a backpack! Yep, you read right..a backpack.   Yo~ If you're so inclined...try that bacon. It's crisp and fatty in the right places.   P.S. the crust can leave crumbs/powder/graham cracker looking cake-y stuff on you and everything it comes into contact. This is an issue as I was wearing ALL black but it doesn't detract from the flavor."}
{"text":"Came here because of Yelp reviews and because I was right across the street while wandering through the streets if Charlotte. It was completely empty when we walked in which typically isn't a good sign but I wanted pizza!  They had some interesting full pizzas or pizza slices to offer. A few different meat pizzas including chorizo and pepperoni. We were thinking more vegetarian and they had some good options! We were deciding between the margherita, pesto and the veggie setting on the large veggie.   The pizza here is baked fresh with fresh ingredients. Definitely makes a difference. Not the best pizza I have ever had but pretty good. I will definitely be back to try some other options.   I will say that the decor is a little iffy. I understand they're going for a certain type of vibe but could use some updates. Definitely kind of old and janky."}
{"text":"We came here on a Groupon we bought for brunch. I had a Bloody Mary which wasn't my style. It had sake instead of vodka. But if your a Bloody Mary connoisseur give it a try. They have a Bloody Mary bar with all the go to's!    Bummed I had to send my food back not once but twice for an raw/under cooked egg. After the 2nd time I was hoping for something new but they brought back my omelette microwaved another time. I would get pizza next time as hubby raves about it. Disappointed I boxed up the now over-cooked half-picked at omelette.   On a better note, Hubby had bacon, egg cheese pizza the \"hoofy \" he loved it!   It's a great space , locally -sourced farm to table, good beer selection and outside seating. Will be back but maybe not for brunch for a while."}
{"text":"I was so, so, so disappointed with this place.  For $24+tip, you'd think that at least something would have gone right.  But no.    We ordered two 10\" pizzas.  One arrived 17 minutes after we ordered it and it looked like it had huge boils on it where the bread had swelled up and was burned without any toppings.  It looked like someone forgot to apply sunscreen (and by sunscreen I mean cheese) and it burned.  I'm used to seeing this on tourists at the beach, not on specialty pizzas.  Moreover, for a FIVE CHEESE pizza, there was surprisingly little cheese on it.  And although we were warned that the pizza had blue cheese (was she trying to scare us off?), it really tasted like generic mozzarella plus a little bit of goat.  I think we were missing three cheeses.  The delivery chick mumbled something when she dropped it off but I couldn't for the life of me catch a single syllable.    17 minutes was not great, but not the worst timing ever.  Our second pizza, however, didn't come out for another 12 minutes.  How is that possible?  We ordered two pizzas at the same time, but one came out AFTER an order placed SEVEN MINUTES AFTER US got their family sized pizza and drinks?  Well, if you are going to tell me that it just got stuck and/or forgotten in the oven all that time, you know, I might just have to agree with you.  It was even more burned than the first pizza.  And had even less cheese.  Seriously, less than half of the pizza had cheese on it.  Most of the pizza was either bare bread or just tomato sauce.  The ham was completely dried out and singed at the edges.  The roasted garlic was blackened.  CHARCOAL scrapings.    I was so annoyed, not the least at the ever-mumbling delivery person, that I wanted to walk it back to the counter and send it back.  Unfortunately, because it had taken so long, I had eaten most of the other pizza and my partner shoved the rest of this in his mouth so we could leave.    And we left crust.  That's how bad it was.  He NEVER leaves crust.  He's eaten my crust when it has sat on an uncovered plate in the fridge for three days being from a generic national chain.  And this after I had devoured most of his lunch in a feeble attempt to wait for my meal.  That's some bad crust...  P.S. Noted from another review that tipping is not expected here.  Keep that in mind, especially because if you tip before you actually get served, you might tip for terrible pizza and service.  They've got a tip jar on the counter--add to that after if you like what you've got.  Don't gamble ahead of time like I did."}
{"text":"First of all, I love house based restaurants. These tend to be hard working, high quality striving to please the customer places that are also very entitative in menu and ingredients.  Pure Pizza is that and more. The staff is very welcoming. The atmosphere is very trendy and eclectic in nature, which of all I love. The food, from the knots to the fresh salad to the pizza was all wonderfully fresh and full of flavor.  Will be sure to make Pure Pizza a must stop for Charlotte pizza."}
{"text":"I was on the fence about Pure Pizza after having only visited their 7th Street Market location but this Plaza Midwood location won me over!    The old house it's in is adorable. I came for a lunch meeting and we lingered for a couple hours, just chatting and plotting to take over the world. There wasn't a crowd, btw. We weren't total jerks, taking a table when others were waiting. In fact, when we left at 3pm, we were the only ones in the place.  From the minute you walk in the door, you're greeted by the smell of pizza crust. Can someone turn that smell into an air freshener for me? Seriously. My mouth started watering immediately! I had grand plans of getting a salad but the minute I smelled the baking dough, it was a lost cause. Pizza all the way!   I ordered the Chorizo pizza and regret nothing! It was delicious -- greasy chorizo balanced with sliced radish, red onions, fresh tomatoes, cilantro and a lime wedge that I squeezed over the entire thing. All on the sprouted ancient grain dough because that's healthy, right?! It was such a unique flavor combination and I loved every bite. In case all that wasn't enough, they also offer up Cloister Honey to dip your crust. I had the bourbon honey. It was totally gross. Trust me. You shouldn't order it. I'll just take on the burden of eating all the bourbon honey for everyone. ;)"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are a little hit or miss for me... Some are great and some are pretty dry and bland. I've learned to stick with the deconstructed pulled pork pizza (one of the greats) and am rarely disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. Monday's are $1 copper drafts... yes a 16oz. And Tuesday's special is buy one pizza get one free."}
{"text":"I'm taking classes at UNCC's city center and this place is within walking distance. The service is relatively fast. They hand knead the dough. I decided on a pepperoni calzone, they cost $7. The bread was a lot softer than it looked so that was a relief. They make them with ricotta and mozzarella cheese, I could have done without the ricotta. All my pepperonis were clumped together so that was an annoyance. At first I thought they were just stingy but upon further dissection I realized they were just in two places instead of all over. Kinda interested in trying their pizza."}
{"text":"Overall good pizza, but extremely expensive. Their pepperoni specialty pizza is $15.95 for a small 12 inches! Add one extra topping, and now you're up to about $20 for a personal-sized pizza. On top of that, their payment system asks for a tip up front.  An up-front request for a tip always feels a little awkward to me. Also, I'm not sure what I'm tipping for, there isn't much service to actually tip for.  The pizza is dropped off at your table. Napkins? Plates? Condiments? Red pepper? All kept at the bar area.  Leave all your stuff alone on the table, trek back up to the bar, and get it all yourself. You are also expected to bus your own table.   The rest of the choices there are good, including their salads and sandwiches. All still very pricey.   Conclusion: good food, but you pay thru the nose for it. Is their pizza 3x as good as Fuel? Definitely not."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really good pizza, though a bit greasy.  The service, however, is really not that great.  The two times I have been there, all guys have been working and they are not very excited about their product.  It is like they are doing me a favor to make a pizza.  I arrived there today at 7:01 pm and they refused to serve me because they were closed and were really quite rude about it.  I didn't argue, but I had driven 20 miles from work to get there so it was disappointing that they couldn't make a single pizza.  I have worked in restaurants; they were going to be there anyway, cleaning up for at least 30-45 minutes.  Obviously they are not interested in customers and I was a relatively new one.  Again, the pizza is great, but do not expect to be impressed with service (although conveniently it pops up to \"tip\" them on the Ipad when you swipe your card.)  Gotta love the audacity of that!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I usually just get a small cheese pizza with basil, the appetizer mushrooms are AMAZING (also great to add your leftovers to eggs for breakfast), and recently discovered the buffalo chicken roll ups.  All of it is so good. Highly recommend trying it out!!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try Pure Pizzs's new location which is in the building vacated by Lulu.Very thankful to see a restaurant go in here rather than another building bulldozed for apartments.  Anyway, unlike the 7th street station location, this is a sit down restaurant with table service. There's seating in the from to rooms to the right and it looks like a bar in the back.  The best thing to come here for is pizza although there are other things on the menu like calzones, salads and sandwiches. They feature fresh and healthy ingredients here so you cannot go wrong with anything. On the table, they even have a little card that tells the story on where their tomatoes come from.  On this visit, I went with the Geno D's pizza which was absolutely delicious. Loved the garlic flavoris and the bite size toppings. The dough is amazing here. It's the only place where I actually enjoy eating the crust of the pizza. The only fault here is that the pizza was a bit soggy but why eat pizza if you don't expect to get messy?  Good stuff Pure. It's a shame I do not live closer."}
{"text":"So I finally was able to try Pure Pizza.  I had a day off and headed to 7th Street public market. Apparently so did everyone else had off that day as well so I waited in line for like forever.  Finally got up to the line. I had checked their menu online first and the Wild Mushroom pizza spoke to me.  The online menu says it comes with oyster mushrooms, cheese, truffle oil and organic tomato sauce.  The pizza came out in about 20 minutes. It looked amazing and while it also tasted wonderful. The dough was fantastic. The best dough I've ever tasted on a pizza. The mushrooms and cheese were great as well. And the sauce?  Hey, where's the sauce?  No sauce on this pizza.  Dang. Was really looking forward to that part too.  So I was a bit disappointed that there was no sauce but overall it was a good pizza. Have to come back and see if this was a mistake or the online menu is incorrect.  I even checked it again when I got home."}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious! & 7th Street Public Market is such a cool place to be! Even though it closes at 7pm, which is crazy, it's got an atrium feel with lots of locally owned and operated shops/food places inside. While we waited for our pizza, the T REX (grr) we sipped on some brews from Tank's Tap. The pizza was huge! More than enough for 2 people and absolutely scrumptious. With 4 or 5 kinds of meat and loaded with cheese, it's definitely a pizza you need a fork and knife to eat.... but there's nothing wrong with that! Everything is farm to table fresh and they even offer gluten free options! I love this place!"}
{"text":"They have a vegan menu (: happiness! Got a small pizza with vegan cheese and spinach! It was delicious :) will come back if in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Yeah, two stars and that's all it deserves! Sure the food is really tasty but that is really all Pure Pizza has going for it.  Look I get the whole organic/granola/hipster thing everyone is into these days. I like that we are getting back to real foods with real names from real people. But honestly this \"market\" aka \"food court\" is a prepackaged sterile side show! Its located in the heart of downtown Charlotte, and has the typical chalk board menus, old style metal chairs, and hokey 'barn' carts to hold food items. The walls are covered with images of vegetalbles/flowers/smiling people/and all that organic stuff. There are about 10 other shops in there (coffee, sushi, meat, wine, pizza, desserts, etc) and each one is playing on the farm local organic vibe. But come on people this was hand picked by marketing and designers to make you FEEL like your in an old world market/little farm town. And its specifically designed to pull in the younger crowd working in downtown that wants to be a part of that image.  Let me get off my soap box and talk about Pure Pizza. I ordered a medium and 3 bottled waters for a total of $24. The cost was a little high, but I thought maybe the pizza would be all that other Yelpers had raved about. I figured that would be more than enough for my wife and toddler to enjoy. Anyway, yes I did enjoy the pizza, but it was more like a small in the realm of pizzas. On top of that these pizzas are thin crust, no not crazy paper thin, but thinner than I was expecting and from seeing it I knew it would not be enough for my family. Regardless though the pizza was super tasty with a great crust and the honey to dip the crust in was a very pleasing. But all it did was make me want like 2 more pizzas! But I was not about to drop almost $75 dollars on a lunch! And how much were those stinking bottled waters!?! They weren't even anything special and actually they were super cheap bottled waters with caps that were annoying to take off. But whatever the pizza although amazing on taste is too expensive for the amount you get.   Yeah I know all organic and free range and vegan with no preservatives and high fructose corn syrup is worth the extra coin. But I can't recommend this place because of the cost:food ratio. It's that simple! In addition to the prepackaged 'market' theme that your immersed in... its just to fake for me.   There are better values in Charlotte than Pure Pizza. I'd rather go to the Penguin for some true local flavor!!"}
{"text":"Its 9:30 at noght and I just left the Interfaith pro immigration demonstrations in First Ward Park. The table next to me is discussing geopolotics. I'm waiting for the T-Rex pizza. My coisin insisted on this one last time we were here. His suggestions are always welcome. He loves locally sourced, organic fair. I could care less but its always nice when it happens.  I love the food here, and unlike its 7th St. Market counterpart the stand alone complex on Central Ave. is perfect for a quiet meal in a comfortable enviorment. The complementary honey burbon sauce is the perfect compliment for lonely pizza ends.  It's a self serve restaurant with friendly wait staff that ensures prompt and reliable service.  The parking can sometimes be dicy, but not tonight. My vegetarian aspirations will have to wait."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious! Laid back vibe and very casual. They have a great beer selection and 1/2 price wine on Wednesdays. Make sure you ask for the spicy or bourbon honey to dip your pizza in."}
{"text":"Love the sprouted grain crust. Consistently good pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch today and I'm in love. I have been on the hunt for a calzone that hits the spot and this did just that - FOR $7.00! The restaurant was very cute and our server was great! I do believe I found my new favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with super friendly staff! They have a personal size which has slices that are perfect for little ones. Not too pricey and the market environment is just a fun one."}
{"text":"farm to table pizza is truly difficult to find, especially if you want gluten free.  This is the only pizza place I will go to in Charlotte.  Props for using quality ingredients!"}
{"text":"Pure pizza is a beautiful place with high ideals and high standards. I love what they stand for and what they do, especially for patrons with food allergies.  I have gotten pizza and salad from their 7th st market location several times over the years and I've always been impressed.   When the new Central ave location opened we were freaking out to try it. We knew the restaurant would be mobbed the first couple weekends so we placed to go orders instead.   I got the gluten free Margherita. When I got home and opened it looked like heaven - soft crust, yummy looking cheese and sauce. One small problem - there was no \"GF\" sticker or other indicator so that I knew I had actually gotten the GF crust that I ordered. This is a little scary for people with allergies because you just have to hope they got it right. Which I did. I tried to call but no one picked up. Plus the pizza looked so great I really didn't want to turn around and drive all the way back to ask.   Well, it was absolutely delicious. Very flavorful, but I got pretty sick pretty quickly. The next day was tough and I blamed myself. They just opened, staff may be making more mistakes, you should've double-checked, I thought.   So I gave them another shot a weekend or two later. Again we picked up, again there was no GF sticker on my box...but this time when I opened it, it was 100% clear I got the GF crust. It looked nothing like the first pizza. The crust was very thin, small, no chew, no fluff, looked like it had been frozen maybe - it was pretty dried out. So, disappointing in a different way. Or maybe getting a non-GF crust the first time (which was amazing even though it hurt me) set me up for disappointment when I finally got the real GF deal.   I still plan to give Pure Pizza my business in the future. They work so hard and care so much about the food they make. I'm just giving this location a bit more time. I do wish they would use GF stickers or some sort of indicator as many other restaurants do to help out the people who order specially prepared food.  ***i appreciate Juli taking the time to respond, it shows a lot of care given to customer service. That said, my 3 star review was not based on getting an incorrect pizza the first time, or hopes of getting GF stickers on to go pizzas - which I did try to call them about, but got no answer. My review encompassed my experience so far with this location, but the star rating was based on the actual GF pizza I got the second time. I also don't think that 3 stars is bad, but a rating of fair. I gave their other location 5 stars based on my experiences there, and plan to update my review of this location based on my future experiences. Just trying to help others who will eat there make informed menu selections. No free pizza needed, but thank you."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, fantastic concept, fantastic food. Everything is delicious and fresh. Everything we've had has been perfect. The ingredients are the best quality and it really does make the difference. I can't wait for the new location on central ave, and the expanded menu with more gluten free options."}
{"text":"Quilt free pizza, this one never fails to please. Though usually crowded the service if fast and efficient. Each time I have been we have tried a different pizza and all have had a unique taste. The freshness of the ingredients makes pizza eating anywhere else unthinkable. Casual laid back atmosphere, always lively."}
{"text":"SO delicious - the wild mushroom pizza is amazing. Love the thin crust and honey sauce"}
{"text":"Love this pizza place! We got a free order of garlic knots with check-in and they were perfectly garlicky, crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside. I got the She-Rex which had an assortment of veggies (peppers, onion, mushrooms) with greens tossed in a lemon vinaigrette on top. The pizza itself was delicious and I especially loved the crust. The greens on top however had an overwhelming taste of vinegar. The dressing was too acidic and needed some balance. My boyfriend got the Slap Yo Mama Lasagna pizza, which may have been one of the best artisan pizzas I've ever had. Definitely ordering that next time!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I found a groupon (still available) and we thought we would give it a try.  I was skeptical of the pizzas because they are not traditional in most ways.  Give them a try!  Pizza was amazing!    I only wish they had another location.  The 7th street Market closes around 7.  Other than that they were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wow I was so impressed with this pizza! It tastes fresh, delicious, and put my taste-buds in a frenzy. This isn't traditional italian pie but it is excellent none-the-less. We had the five cheese, the wild mushroom, and a big greek salad.  I enjoyed all but the wild mushroom with truffle was beyond incredible. The crust is the perfect texture (chewy with a slight crisp) and is served with honey on the side. (doubling as dessert= genius).   Everything is local when possible and it is located at the 7th street Market so you can pick up some other local goodies while waiting for your pizza. I will definitely be ordering some PP in the near future!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Charlotte, plus I enjoy the atmosphere in the 7th Street Market. It's a laid back and cool place to grab a bite and have a beer."}
{"text":"After my initial review, I decided that I erred by not airing our grievances to management \"in the  moment.\"  In my defense, there was little opportunity to do so but I should have dropped-in or phoned when the situation was not as chaotic.  Almost immediately I heard from Manager Julie who expressed a genuine interest in learning more about our experience that night as well as an eagerness to make it up to us.  I appreciate such attentiveness and will definitely patronize Pure Pizza again and soon. I will do so because of Julie's concern and willingness to make things right.  The above rating reflects solely the food from that evening which was delicious.  After my second visit, I will update my rating to reflect the entire experience.  Many thanks to Julie and even more kudos for her superlative customer service."}
{"text":"After frequenting the location at 7th street market, we decided to give this new location a try. The shop is tucked away in what looks like a little house on Central Ave. It's cozy but small. The menu featured a special where you can get a large pizza + pitcher of beer for $33. We asked our server about it and told her we'd like to do that, and ordered a large wild mushroom and small T-rex with a pitcher of beer. The wild mushroom tasted good, but the mushrooms were very unevenly spread. The slice that I pulled out only had one mushroom on it. When the check came, they had charged us $10 higher than what they should have with the special. When we asked the server, she said \"of that's only for a one topping pizza.\" We paid anyway, but then she came back and said it was her mistake and that we had talked to her about it before and she had confirmed it, so she adjusted the check. Also, when we asked for the honey/cinnamon sugar dipping sauces, they said they didn't have any but they had wildflower. I asked what was wildflower, and the response I got was \"oh it's honey.\" Then why are you confusing me by saying you're out of honey? The whole experience was just a little bit bizarre. Maybe they still need to iron out some things, but we will stick to the 7th St Market location, thank you very much."}
{"text":"OMG, why did I need a Groupon to find about this place? I can't believe I hadn't tried this for so long! Firstly, since this place is inside the 7th Street Market, parking is validated.  So there was this $10 for $20 Groupon deal for this place that came up on my phone. Because I hadn't heard of this place before I looked it up on Yelp and saw the reviews. Me and my boyfriend headed to this place the following weekend and ordered a large pizza, half Wild Mushroom, half Pure Country. Because everyone was raving about their sprouted grain crust we asked for that, unfortunately they don't do that for the large pizzas. Fortunately, their regular crust tastes delicious too! The Wild Mushroom is my #1 at this place. It is also my boyfriend's favorite, and did I mention, he DISLIKES mushrooms? Go figure!  The second time we went here we got so greedy, we ordered two large pizzas, thinking we would have them for lunch the following few days, and we did. The second time we did half Pepperoni Supreme, half T-Rex and a while Wild Mushroom! Oh Mother of God, that was like the best pizza weekend ever! Also, I really like how they give you honey and cinnamon sugar with the pizza to dip the crust in at the end. I enjoyed that part so much (especially since I throw away all the crust or give it to my boyfriend), that I started doing that with all pizzas I get from other stores. But no, sadly that doesn't taste so great with other pizza places. This place really has some magic ingredient in their crust, next time I'm seriously considering getting my pizza half wild mushroom, half plain crust!"}
{"text":"I love pizza, but my wife is lactose intolerant. I'm sure you can see the predicament this puts us in, however, Pure pizza has solved all of our problems! Their vegan cheese is out of this world (a rarity), and we love coming here."}
{"text":"I ordered pick up of pure pizza for my workmates and I for lunch. My workmates ordered the She Rex and really liked it! Lots of veggies! I ordered the Greek salad and added chicken. It was really fulfilling and quite tasty! Another workmate ordered the calzone and really liked it. I love the hipster air about the restaurant and the staff is really nice and accommodating. You are able to order online or call in but are also welcome to dine in. They offer gluten free options but don't have dedicated pans or areas so if you are very sensitive to cross gluten contamination make sure not to eat here! All the ingredients are fresh and delicious. They have my business for life!"}
{"text":"I have been on the search for a gourmet pizza place in Charlotte that wont break the bank and this is it! I dont think that they could make a pizza that I wouldn't like. They also offer a honey bourbon sauce with your pizza. It is amazing to dip your crust in this! It is located in 7th Street market which is so convenient. Plus, they validate parking which is quite nifty!"}
{"text":"Pizza is subjective - typically the best pizza you have ever had is the one you grew up with...until now.  This is the best pizza I ever had.  Lived in the northeast and had Italians and Greeks make pizza for me.  Been to Italy.  This is better.  Get the spelt crust.  Get the margarita pizza, or anything else on the menu.  Get vino at the shop nearby an enjoy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Charlotte! You can really taste the difference with their fresh veggies, hormone free meats and home made sauce. I love all their pizzas but my favorite is the BBQ chicken pizza. It's not like any other BBQ pizza! Their BBQ sauce is made in house and has a unique taste, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza! Great options for gluten free eaters. Mushroom truffle is my favorite. They always have local brews on tap. Inside decor is great"}
{"text":"Updated after trying more pizzas (had to go back only a week later, it was too good!)  Initial Review:  Pure Pizza is definitely the best pizza I've had in Charlotte thus far. I ordered the pesto pizza with tomatoes and red onion with a few friends, and it was superb! The crust is thin but stays crispy enough to hold up the toppings, the sauce to cheese ratio is solid, and all of the ingredients added great flavor without overpowering the pizza as a whole. You can really tell with their farm to table approach that they have high quality ingredients based on the taste alone. While this does cause the prices to be a bit higher than pizza chains, the quality more than makes up for it. My only complain is that I wish they had smaller options than 12\" so that I could get a personal pizza during my lunch hour at work- but hey maybe I'll just have to feel like pigging out or want some leftovers that day.  New: The Slap Yo Mama Lasagna is also incredible. The ricotta, ground beef, and Italian herb combo makes this taste spot on like lasagna filling..it's incredible. The wild mushroom pizza is nice and cheesy with a strong roasted mushroom taste. Also go a free order of garlic knots which didn't have a ton of garlic flavor but were buttery and had a good bit of parmesan on top. With the marinara sauce, they were very solid. All three pizzas I've tried have been out of this world. The crust is thin but still crispy, and the pizzas come out very fast (less than 10 minutes both visits). The only downside is the slightly higher price than other pizza places but the quality justifies it if you're looking for really good pizza."}
{"text":"These guys are pretty damn awesome. Their gluten-free crust is homemade and has super basic ingredients (read: no soy, potato starch, corn, etc), so it's all stuff I can eat! They make me happy!  I can't tell you how thankful I am there is a place that that has a truly healthful pizza. Service at this location and the friendliness of the staff is also always on point. There's usually a line for the pizza, but the wait doesn't ever seem to be all that long. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Pure Pizza is a great spot to grab a meal or a pizza on the go. Just had the Lulu and it was expertly done. Kelsey and the staff were all friendly and very accommodating. I will be back. Don't miss this jewel! I have never been disappointed. Great experience at a fantastic place."}
{"text":"I love Pure Pizza. I love their pies. I love the Cloister Honey for my crust. I love how they use local and area products whenever possible. Farm to table pizza, y'all.  My review for their uptown location in 7th Street Public Market is basically just a love letter to their chorizo pizza. Hey bae, how you doin' (in my best Joey from Friends voice). The chorizo is my favorite. I know it may sound like an odd pizza, but it is absolutely delicious. Pepperoni Supreme and Smoke Salmon are also two of my favs. This is one of those places that I don't think you can really go wrong with any of them. My roommie loves the Tuck N Rolls (we usually get buffalo chicken). Gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian menus are available.  Back to the honey, ask for it. You'll want to dip your crust in it. Trust me. You're welcome.   Make sure to follow them on IG and check out their events calendar. There are always great specials and/or events every day. Parents, note: kids eat free on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Great pizza. We watched the chef making the pizza while sitting at the bar. Pizza was fresh and the honey for dipping the crust was simply genius!  I'll never eat the crust without it now.  Loved it!  Can't wait to come back to Charlotte just for this!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in CLT hands down!!! Had it for the 2nd time last night and it was amazing. Highly recommend Nicole! She is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I'm still dreaming about the calzone I had here! For only $7, you get the authentic taste of Italy right in your mouth. The ricotta-stuffed calzone is gooey and the crust/shell is the real deal.  The interior has a country rustic feel to it, which I was not expecting but found pleasant. The half of wine deal on Wednesdays was great! I got to sip on an Italian red blend and enjoy my calzone - just like they do across the pond."}
{"text":"Oh this pizza is so so awesome. As you can see from my picture, I got spinach and mushroom with gluten-free crust. The cheese was rich, the spinach fresh, and the crust was nice and crispy. And the service was fast and portion size just right. Love Pure Pizza!"}
{"text":"Neat little pizza place inside 7th Street Market! They make the floppy, NY style (if that's your thing), and it tastes incredible. I love the fact that they use natural, locally-sourced ingredients wherever possible. Meats, veg, even the flour for the dough is milled in NC. And naturally, they have local brews on tap (NoDa Red: if you haven't tried it yet, perfect with pizza).  You can do the simple, comfortable pizzas (cheese, pepperoni), but they also have some really inventive stuff. My visit, the pizza of the day was a field greens pie - cheese pizza with a locally-grown field greens mix on top. Everything comes to you hot and fresh, and it's hard to stop eating once you dig in. These guys know their stuff! If they offer you honey for your crust, take it. I've never dipped pizza crusts in honey before, but it works!  The staff are incredibly nice and make you feel welcome. Be sure to grab a pizza from Pure next time you are in the Market - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pizza, even better calzones, there's usually a line for lunch but the staff is pretty friendly. Recommend it"}
{"text":"The atmosphere within the marketplace was very nice.  The pizza we ordered was very tasty.  I really enjoyed the cornmeal crust.  The unpleasant part was the excessive grease that topped the pizza.  I've never had to spend so much time dabbing a pizza with napkins before.  Normally a little grease doesn't bother me,  this was too much!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza..best crust in CLT and the organic toppings run both to the traditional (pepperoni, sausage, etc) to the somewhat exotic (truffle oil, smoked salmon). Love both the special sauce (kind of like a spicy, chunky gazpacho) and the pepper-infused local honey to dip the crust in..both nice touches.  If I had a rub, it would be the price point. $12 for a 10 inch is a tad steep for where their digs are located (7th St Market) and the amentites provided.  That said, however, in this pizza-starved town of ours, the product really shines."}
{"text":"Spot on. Pepperoni is on another level as well as there chorizo.  Fast preparation multiple options for anyone palate."}
{"text":"I order a pizza to go, the same person that took my order also was making the pizza. A guy came up and  got a drink and handed the man two dollars . The cook never washed his hands and went back to making my pizza. This isn't sanitary and I will not be back."}
{"text":"I ordered Pure Pizza from Postmates, so I cannot say anything to the actual location or service here. I'm only going by the food.   I ordered a deconstructed pulled pork, a mushroom appetizer, and a side salad for my pizza. When my pizza got here it had this super bright purple coleslaw, and as a picky eater I stared at it for a good few minutes before deciding to take a tiny, dainty bite and found it was actually really good. The pizza was great! It had a nice chewy crust and excellent amount of cheese, my only complaint was the coleslaw got a bit runny and made some of the slices a little soggy (hence the 4 stars, which really I wish could be 4.5 but whatever). The mushrooms were fantastic as well, really enjoyed the cheese that came with them. Salad was okay, but only because I like to pretend like I'm healthy when I eat a salad but really cover the whole thing in dressing. If I were at the restaurant I would have asked for a lot of extra dressing, so it's not their fault that I had a dry salad with all those \"vitamins\" and \"minerals\" or whatever the kids are calling them now."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. It is in a rundown house with tab water jugs of water as table decor. Pizza was no better than frozen pizza. Considering the ingredients are supposedly homegrown the prices do not reflect the abiance  or decor. Cheap ingredients cheap decor equals expensive pizza...that does not add up to me"}
{"text":"Pure Pizza marches to its own drum, and I mean that in the best way. I happened to be in town overnight and my BIL is currently living in Charlotte. He said PP is one of his favorites and so, we had dinner here.  First - I love the space. It's a converted 20's bungalow and I have much love for old spaces that are well used and preserved. There's a big takeout counter when you enter and a hidden (tiny) bar toward the rear - in front is a lovely patio. Apparently when it's \"nice\" (ahahaha it was like 65 out and I guess that is \"cold\" here) the patio is packed. Anyway - PP has a special every night and just my luck, Thursdays is \"kids eat free\" - hooray? Actually, it was fine because it seems like people in Charlotte actually parent, and don't let their kids run amok like at home.   Second - the food is really tasty. I ordered pizza because the place is called Pure PIZZA and not Pure Sandwich. You can get anything in a 10\" which is the right size for one person or you can go buck wild and get a big pie to share. Mine was delicious - crisp, chewy crust, fresh sauce and just a bit of spice. Apparently there is honey to dip yo' crust in? Must be a local thing but we weren't offered it and I surely did not miss it as I ate every bite of that lovely, airy crust as it was - unadorned and beautiful.   Third - service is...well, it's something. Kind and welcoming for sure. Perhaps a tad...absentminded? I mean, they want you to be happy. Everyone is nice. They're just on a different time zone? Be patient. You might have to ask for a refill more than once, but come on - where else do you have to be?   Pure Pizza is delicious for sure. Come armed with time and a sense of humor and prepare for some good eats. Also, don't be parking in the VFW lot next door - you've been warned and they have a cannon."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and so delicious!  They are located in the 7th Street market.  The service was great and everyone was extremely friendly.  I was attended to immediately and I also received my order pretty quick.  I ordered garlic knots and a small cheese pizza.  Their garlic knots might be my favorite garlic knots, and I'm saying that having tried a ton of garlic knots!  The pizza was really good as well.  I've gone back a bunch to order the garlic knots, the large size will fill you up.  It is a little pricey though, which is my reasoning for giving it four stars, but other than that, it's amazing!  If you haven't tried out Pure Pizza yet, you should definitely make your way there very soon!  Don't forget to check in and get free garlic knots!"}
{"text":"For a gluten free option for pizza while in this area of Charlotte this is a decent option.   Price good and they also had vegan cheese options for those who can't do dairy.     The pizza (individual size) was a great lunch.  The location is pretty nice.  Like an indoor 'farmers market' open daily.  Couple vendors, but mostly food and beverage place."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza I've had in Charlotte. They specialize in fresh, high quality ingredients. The crust is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside without being too thick or too thin. Be sure to ask for honey to dip your crusts in; my husband and I prefer the spicy honey and the bourbon honey but our 8-year-old loves the cinnamon honey. Get the smoked mozzarella instead of regular mozzarella if you want to take your pizza from great to amazing.  Their staff is friendly and efficient, although they're more reliable in person than over the phone. I have called in a couple of takeout orders that weren't 100% accurate (one topping different than what was ordered)."}
{"text":"Left a real bad taste in my mouth.  Warning my pizza loving friends.  This restaurant needs a lesson in good business.  I ordered here tonight and they really screwed up and refused to make things right.  I ordered a large lasagna pizza half with beef, half with sausage.  What they gave us was a small with all beef and offered to charge us for another small pizza if we wanted more.  No offer of refund or remake.  Beware.  They will screw up your order and then refuse to fix the situation.  Will not be coming back and will be letting everybody know"}
{"text":"I came to 7th Street Public Market just to partake in vegan pizza at Pure Pizza and boy was the drive worth it.  Thank you once again fellow Yelpers for leading me to the promised land.   I took a moment to look at the menu. Still unsure of what to order, I asked the guy at the counter for a recommendation. He was super polite but no help. So I opted for wild mushroom pizza and substituted daiya for the mozzarella on the Neapolitan crust.   Accompanied by my pomegranate aranciata from Zia Pia (also in the market see review), I dug in with the best intentions to eat only half of the pizza. I failed miserably and ate it all. The crust was perfectly cooked and the perfect combination of soft, chewy and crispy. The mushrooms were perfectly seasoned and the truffle oil such depth to the flavor profile. The Daiya was perfectly cooked and gave the pizza a beautiful creaminess.   The pizza was so simple in its ingredient yet so wonderfully nuanced in its execution. It was worth the $15+ spent. I will most certainly be returning to partake in their pizzas in the very near future."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with Pizza Peel just down the street, Pure Pizza is a larger location for their restaurant located inside the Seventh Street Market.  Pure Pizza is housed in Lulu's former spot, a small house off Central Avenue (with a small adjacent parking lot).   When you first walk in the door, it smells absolutely amazing.  Pure Pizza has a great vibe, with awesome rock music, and tables situated so that it has a really cozy feel.  My husband and I both ordered 10-inch pizzas, including the margarita pizza and the T-Rex.  Their pizza crust is very thin, and they cook the pizzas well so they are extremely crispy.  While not like the usual margarita pizza (with sliced whole milk mozzarella and fresh tomatoes), Pure's margarita pizza was still very good.  Mozzarella cheese covered the pie, and their tomato sauce tasted very fresh. They also topped the pizza with fresh basil.  My husband's T-Rex pizza was full of meat, and very good.  We debated whether Pure Pizza was better than Alino's in Mooresville.  I prefer Alino's, as it's more of a true New York style pizza (i.e., large and foldable) , but my husband prefers Pure Pizza because the pizza is crispier.  I'm just glad we've found another option for great pizza in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Just because Pure Pizza is in a cool hipster neighbourhood and just because it's rated as one of the up and coming brunch spots in the city doesn't mean it's gone to their head. In fact, this is one of the most warm, friendly welcomes I've received. The DJ was hip but not so cool he couldn't entertain one of the kids asking for a request. The waffles were as promised, house made, delicious and HUGE! My fav of the stop? The brussels sprouts appetizer which was over the top :) Great brunch on our whirlwind tour of Charlotte. I wrote an article about my whole day at influencemagazines.com"}
{"text":"I've been to 7th street market for lunch several times and after hearing such great things about Pure Pizza, I was excited to give it a try. Unfortunately my bad experience started right at the register. I went on a Friday a few weeks ago at 12:30pm. As expected, the market was a zoo. To complicate things further, I had my 4 month old with me in a stroller. I was surprised to see that there were only 2 people in line in front of me to order. The friends I came with went to Local Loaf and their line was much longer than mine. When it was my turn to order, I walked up to the register and pushed my stroller in a way that it wasn't blocking the main aisle. Apparently the cashier (who appeared to be miserable to be at work that day) was not pleased and firmly said \"You're going to need to push that stroller down there\" as he pointed down the aisle past their drink fridge. My stroller was positioned in a way that partially blocked the path from their kitchen to deliver orders to customers. Even though it took me a total of 2 minutes at most to order and pay and no food ever came out during that time, I did as he requested. I was entirely uncomfortable leaving my baby unattended in the stroller down the hallway in a busy market, but he wouldn't serve me until I moved it.  I ordered their 10\" pork pizza and got a bottle of sprite. I was shocked when my bill was close to $15. Nonetheless I paid quickly and went to get my baby from down the hall. The second big mistake was that I was given a #1 table marker. I had no idea where I stood in line waiting for my food at that point. However I was never told or given any indication that the wait would be very long. I went and got a table and sat with my friends. After 20 minutes went by, I still had no food. I thought I would go check back with the cashier in case my number wasn't visible enough. My friends were already eating their food from Local Loaf at this point. The cashier REFUSED to make eye contact with me. I waited by the side of his register until he was through with taking someone's order and then he proceeded to move forward with the next customers. Finally one of the cooks noticed me standing there and told me they were still working on my order. So I went back to my seat.  After another 15 minutes and my friends finishing their lunch by this point (35 minutes total) I went back to the cashier a second time. This time he noticed me right away and with attitude said \"You're order is about to go into the oven\". So I sat down for another 10 minutes before my food finally came out. So I waited a total of 45 minutes for my food. By this point I had a very displeased 4 month old and I felt incredibly rushed since my friends had finished their lunch 10 minutes earlier. I thought for sure the pizza may make it all worth it, but yet again that was mistake #3.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the pork pizza was not good at all. The pork on top was dry and charred black. They put a heaping scoop of purple slaw right on top in the middle of the pizza. It made the pizza cold and soggy. The \"special sauce\" tasted like a buffalo wing sauce which didn't go at all with the pork flavor or slaw.   Needless to say, I had a horrible experience overall and won't be returning. Too expensive, terrible customer service, and not good pizza for what you pay. Save yourself the time and money and eat at Local Loaf or Hazelnut Creperie."}
{"text":"Had a really good time here with my family. The decor and atmosphere is pretty eclectic and fun. The seating are is nice and cozy and the pizza was delish. Definitely think it's worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, casual, located in a venue where you need to find a seat which can be challenging on weekends, but salad and pizza are excellent."}
{"text":"I don't give many 5 stars, but this place definitely deserves it.  First off, try the garlic knots! They weren't too doughy and it was the perfect amount of garlic and cheese. As for pizza, I got the chorizo pizza. I love that they put radish on the pizza because I thought it tasted great with it. Next time, I really want to try T-rex. I've heard many great things about it.  While this place isn't the cheapest pizza joint (a small 10' runs for about $10.95), it's definitely one of the best in Charlotte. I drove about an hour just to try this out and I'll do it again! Also, I came in around 4. That isn't quite rush hour or dinner time, so I got my food really fast.   It's more food than it seems so don't underestimate the size. You will be full!  PS. THERE IS WIFI! Check the cash register for the password."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza, bad Caesar salad, and high prices. On the positive side, service was good and we got our order very quickly."}
{"text":"Pure pizza in the 7th Street Market is pure heaven for a pizza lover that tries to eat healthfully. Even on a Saturday at lunchtime the market was packed and tables were hard to find. The line at Pure pizza moved quickly and the food was delivered to our table in about 15 minutes. My friend and I went for the sprouted ancient grain crust, which was full of flavor and had a really good texture, crisp but not tough and with a delightful whole wheat feel to it. While not gluten free, this option is definitely \"gluten friendly\" all the standard toppings are available and we went with the pepperoni supreme that was packed full of flavor. the bill for a medium pizza with 2 bottles of water was $21. The only drawback is the parking situation. We parked in the deck and were only there for less than an hour and a half and it cost $8.00. Next time, I may try riding the light rail. No matter where I have to park though, I'll be back to try more of Pure Pizza's offerings soon."}
{"text":"Gluten Free pizza was the consistency of Wonder-bread and had the flavor of bread that sits in the refrigerator collecting all the random flavors.   Caesar salad consisted of wilted, past date mixed greens and amounted to less than a handful."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, pretty slow service.  The waitress was exceptionally nice, that wasn't the issue.  She took forever to greet us and take our order, then didn't check with us after the food came out.  I asked another server to bring hot peppers & parm, but she never did.  I had to order a beer from someone else and waited forever to get the honey after asking for it from our main server.  We had no napkins and didn't get any until we were basically done.  It was a week night, we sat on the patio and it was not busy at all, so I don't know what happened.  The pizza I ordered was good, would've been better with hot peppers and parm cheese.  Also if I got the honey when the pizza actually came out instead of half way through.  This was my first visit to Pure Pizza and I will give them another chanced because the pizza was better than some of the others around."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town and great location. Anyone in uptown for a night out, a date, a game, etc needs to go here. Many options local supported."}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan of this place. Been here 2 times and both times it hasn't done anything for me. The pepperoni is over the top salty to the point that I was taking it off in an effort to salvage the pizza. My wife had the Wild Mushroom pizza and she wasn't overly impressed. Tried it twice, it's just not for me- won't be a third."}
{"text":"We really love Pure Pizza. We were here last Sunday for the 3rd or 4th time. We end up at this location for brunch and have had dinner a handful of times at 7th Street Station. We have had the shorter, dark haired lady as our server most of the times that we've been here and she is laid back and always makes you feel welcome. (Hey, she puts up with my husband's jokes!)   Our favorite is The Ol Boy pizza. Eggs, chicken, bacon, red bell peppers , onions and hot sauce. After one visit where there may have been an accident with the hot sauce bottle (pizza completely covered in hot sauce) I ask for it on the side. This way the pizza isn't getting soggy also. SO GOOD!! They have THE BEST CRUST and all of the toppings are perfect together.  Be sure to ask for some honey to dip your crust in. It's not Jug O Honey that someone bought from Sams club. It's Cloister honey and after trying it here, I had to go buy a bottle of the bourbon honey.   Also, go for the mimosas. Thanks, Pure Pizza! Everything was great!"}
{"text":"We had tickets to an event in Charlotte on a Friday night and knew we wouldn't have much time for food but wanted quality food and not a fast food joint. We stopped here (our 2nd visit) and got the Mediterranean pizza and farmers salad. My husband got a beer and I walked a few stalls down and bought a glass of wine.  I'm picky about my pizza and their crust is crispy & chewy just like I like it. For an older review that I saw that says it tastes like Dominos...what in the world are you talking about?!?  Not even close. The salad was fresh and fantastic as well. The goat cheese was the best I've ever had.   We made a great choice in that we were able to get great food and not run late to the opening of our show. I just bought a bunch Groupon for their Central Ave location and looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but paint was peeling off the front door and the screen was falling off one of the windows. We used a groupon for brunch today and really enjoyed it. I had a chicken sandwich on foccacia with side salad and mimosa. Husband had chorizo pizza and sake bloody mary. Will definitely go back. It was yum."}
{"text":"I guess I'm in the minority here. To me, the pizza tastes like a glorified version of Domino's. There is definitely a similarity in taste between the two.   If you're looking for New York pizza (real NY pizza, not the places that call themselves \"NY Pizza\"), then you will probably be disappointed. If you're not a pizza snob (as in from NY), then you should be good to go.   It's also a little on the expensive side in regards to value.  Fortunately, this experience led to the discovery of Cloud 9."}
{"text":"I was excited about this place but was very disappointed. Maybe it's just an anomaly but our pie was burnt terribly. To the point that I tasted nothing but burnt toast and garlic. I did my best to eat it because I was extremely hungry, but it was not good. Also very overpriced at $30 for a 16\" pie, and we had to eat again. I don't know what happened. Maybe they were just off there game."}
{"text":"I tried Pure Pizza after seeing it while stopping into the 7th Street Market\" to check out \"Not Just Coffee\".  The pizza was amazing!  Nice thin crispy crust but still a little chewy.  The ingredients are great and it is nice to see them using local produce etc.  My wife and I devoured the pizza and will make this a standard Saturday stop on our weekends.  The only downside are the hours...since it is located in the market, it closes at 7:00pm Mon-Sat.  I live/work north of Charlotte so it is hard for me to get down to it during the week.  Hopefully they will be opening another location soon with more traditional hours so that it is easier for me to get my fix."}
{"text":"I wish I could all kinds of Pizza they have. They ado a great job in their pizza varieties. However, the salad wasn't that great. I had a farmer's salad. Veggies in salad were fresh , but the taste wasn't that great with dressing, as the combination of the veggies and the way the veggies were chopped were too random."}
{"text":"We lived about a half mile down the street from this place for almost a year before we realized we needed to finally try it. BOY WERE WE MISSING OUT! Pure Pizza is easily the best pizza in Charlotte. We ordered the 16\" Pepperoni Supreme, with side Caesar salads, and garlic knots. Every ingredient was farm fresh and impeccably delicious. The restaurant itself looks as if our neighbor cleared out their living and dining rooms for us to join them for dinner; cozy and homey. We're already discussing when it will be socially acceptable for us to go back for more!"}
{"text":"The gluten free \"Garlic\" bread sticks did not have an ounce of garlic in or on them. It was basically just a flat pizza bread crust with a very over-whelming flavor of oregano and basil, the marinara sauce was good tho, but it would have been better if the bread came even hot, it was stone cold bread.   Now the pizza...same crust as the not so garlic bread, and still that flavor of the bread masked the ingredients of the cheeses and spinach on my Mediterranean pizza. And I don't like a spongy texture for my crust as this one had, and was also burnt underneath. At least It was warm...not hot how i like pizza, but warm.  The only thing good was the honey they give you for dipping your crust in.  Now, the drink selection was limited, we got the very last coke...how do you run out of coke??? No ice, no lemons...and the coke had high fructose corn syrup in it where as my sprite was actually with real sugar...so they should have had at lest some consistency with their drink products...*sigh, not very satisfying at all.  And even as I write this, it has taken my bill at least 20 mins to get back to me or even more. On a thurs night they were busy, limited parking spaces, and very loud! Should have sat out side."}
{"text":"The person working as cashier, took our money.  Then proceeded to put our garlic knots and pizza in the oven, while touching our food with barehands!  No gloves, just sweat and fresh mucous from where she had just wiped her nose..  i was in awe that this had just happened in front of my girlfriend and I.  We asked another employee to help us get new food made, since we obviously didnt want to ingest the other employee's bodily fluids.  Then the sweaty employee with no gloves called me \"fucking nasty\"- a direct quote.  She actually argued with and insulted me, a paying customer.  This only got worse when the manager came out and said her employee did no wrong and that we had to leave.   She insisted that making pizza and handling food with out gloves was ACCEPTABLE!!  I couldn't believe what was happening.  Then the manager ran out of the building to get security, on a paying customer.  We were not disrespectful, just wanted clean food.   If there are any arguments to how this happened we can prove it to you since  we videoed the encounter.  I used to go there a few times per week.  This will undoubtedly be the last."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza. Best I have had in Charlotte. Pepperoni Supreme is a rock star! Love that they have different kinds of honey to dip your crusts in.  Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed- guess i went in with sky-high expectations after reading all the glowing reviews. The wild mushroom pizza was ok, a bit pricey at $12 for a small pizza. The pesto pizza was very good. And my kids loved the garlic knots - they even fought over who will get the last one.  This is not like a typical restaurant. It is inside the 7th Street Market, so we park up in the parking garage - we can get the ticket validated once inside(machine next to the Sushi place - free parking for the first 90 min). Take the elevator down, and we enter into the indoor market with Local Loaf, Cloud 9 Confections, Pure Pizza to the right and a Sushi place to the left.   And there are tables food court style - the Saturday morning we went, it was way too crowded and noisy!!! Again, not impressed!!!  The guy who was bringing the orders out was very nice and friendly despite the rush and lines."}
{"text":"I was this place on my first visit to the market but opted for sushi.  Fast forward two weeks and I yelped pizza and Pure Pizza came up.  All the stars aligned and this amazing pizza found a new fan. Fantastic pizza and the garlic knots -Jezus!  The only thing Id change is parmesan free garlic knots.  Prepare yourself people."}
{"text":"Definitely the only pizza in Charlotte that my wife and I enjoy! Pure pizza is pretty good and service and ambience at the restaurant is very casual! They have great buffalo bites that are really good as well!"}
{"text":"I know how it sounds when I say this is the best pizza I have ever had... Believe me.  I know how it comes off... lol  Seriously, though... I can't think of a different way to describe this experience...   They offer a sprouted grain crust as well as a traditional white... The boyfriend and I (or me, however that goes) decided to split the difference... I got the Chorizo pie on sprouted grain and he got the T-Rex on the regular...   The chorizo had an excellent balance of flavor...  The sausage and tomatoes were markedly fresh, the radishes were crisp, the onions were nice and crunchy... My favorite part, though?  The cilantro sprinkled on top and the slice of lime they gave you to drizzle over the top... Omigosh, I literally ate the whole pie... I don't normally finish a meal and I made myself finish that entire pie at one sitting because it was too good to stop... lol  The T-Rex was crazy good... Bacon, ground beef, sausage and pepperoni with a tremendous mozzarella and a perfect accompaniment of organic tomato sauce...   The toppings didn't overwhelm the actual crust, so they both got to shine... The crust stayed crispy (which is very important to me) even though they did not shy away from the sauces or the other ingredients... I made sure to ask for some of that honey to dip the crust in and I was sooooo glad I remembered... It was absolutely heavenly...   I just saw that Foodie Call delivers Pure Pizza now... Why in the world did they tell me that?  I might not be cooking tonight after all... lol"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I travel to Charlotte a lot for work and I find myself eating here almost every visit. The margarita pizza is delicious and with the sprouted grain crust I don't feel too guilty about eating pizza! The mushroom and truffle oil is a solid choice as well. I always think about trying a salad but my inner cheese demon is just too strong!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza from these guys and received something in a box which was unidentifiable as a pizza.  I don't know if the delivery person used the pizza box as a maraca, slammed it up against a wall a few times or what but the thing that arrived was just a balled up thing in a corner of the box.  I called the manager who said this was not her problem and that she inspected the pizza when it left the store. How does a company like this stay in business?  Honestly, how?"}
{"text":"LOVE this pizza. wish they delivered and open later.  makes you feel much better knowing the ingredients that are going into your pizza are locally sourced."}
{"text":"I don't know about you but my craving for Pizza is always coupled with immense guilt for wanting something so unhealthy! not any more though... =)  the Pizzas at Pure are not only delicious, but even after you have devoured an entire pizza you won't get up from your chair feeling overly full or bloated or gross! it probably has to do with the fact that they use fresh / local / organic (when possible) ingredients, and they keep the pizzas simple - thin crusts, moderate toppings, but a good / creative variety to choose from. Yes, I do think the pizzas are a little pricey for what they are; but there's no harm in treating yourself to some delicious, non guilt inducing pizza once in a while! my favorite, is the simplest one on their menu - the margarita pizza with honey on the side. If you're looking for a non tomato based one, the wild mushroom pizza is great. Their pepperoni supreme is pretty good as well, though I thought the pure country one could definitely use a little more prosciutto on it. Their menu also includes sandwiches, calzones and salads - may be I'll get to those some day, but for now I'm sticking with the pizza!"}
{"text":"Food stall expediency with restaurant quality!   I had a surprisingly delicious sandwich at a pizza place! pure pizza is located inside 7th st market, with an inconspicuous business sign- nestled in between a smoothie vendor and bakery stall.  Ordering was simple. Their specialty is obviously \"pizza\" but I got the chicken sandwich. It came with a choice of house or ceased salad, $9. I received my food within 5min. Super fast since It was lunch hour! The chicken is organic and their foccala bread is made in house. I was impressed by the entire presentation and the quality of the fresh ingredients. Hearty portions!   WiFi pwd at the register. free parking for upto 90min from the adjacent garage. Seating is limited so be prepared to scout."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely disgusting and cold. Never eating here again. Got sick. Will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Pure pizza offers some good/great vegan-friendly pizzas, garlic knots, and salads. The staff is nice and I would eat here more often if it wasn't as busy. When it's busy, it's another particularly clean and cheese contamination can be an issue. For this reason, I prefer the other location as it seems to be a bit cleaner and they are able to accommodate a bit better due to the spacing. The food and atmosphere are great, but unfortunately I won't be back to this location due to allergies."}
{"text":"I've been twice to the new Central location.  Knots have been good both times I have been there.  Yelp has a coupon for free knots!   Pizza was great too.  Try the different types of dough.  Good local beer selection too."}
{"text":"I was going to be in town on business for a couple days and this time I took some time for me to actually explore a little more of Charlotte. Pure Pizza popped up on my radar and I knew I would have to try them out. Especially since they were in one of my favorite places: the 7th Street Public Market.   I went for the Pesto Pizza. Typically when I'm trying a new pizza joint I go for the trusty margherita pizza to get a nice base line of what a shop can do, but I switched it up this time and was very glad I did. I paid for my pie, got my number and found a seat in the dining area. Not too long a wait before it was time for me to dig in.  The pizza crust was crisp, but not charred. While I don't mind charred, but I know some pizza patrons do. Plenty of cheese & pesto drizzle to go around on each slice. If I ever make it back here with colleagues, I will definitely recommend getting several small pizzas so we can try a variety of flavors. I almost went back every day while I was in Charlotte, but I had to be fair and explore other options."}
{"text":"This pizza! Thank you for being you!  We ordered a large Mediterranean to take out and enjoy at Revolution. Great crust and fresh toppings! Thank you for so many healthful  and flavorful options.  We'll be sure to do this again, when in town."}
{"text":"7th Street market is just a great place to chill, eat and drink. The folks at Pure Pizza didn't disappoint. My son and I split a 16\" pie and a chicken parmesan sandwich...yes we can eat.  Pizza was great and the crust was crisp the way it should be.  The chicken parmesan sandwich had a huge portion of chicken and was nicely prepared. When we visit the market again, Pure Pizza is on the menu."}
{"text":"Pure Pizza is located an easy walk from our home in the building that housed LuLu.  Ordering is done upon walking in.  The nice thing is that we received free garlic knots with our Yelp check-in! We ordered the five cheese pizza.  It was deliciously cheesy and had a nice, mild pepper sauce on it.  I wish that I had known about the hot pepper honey sauce because I would have loved trying that. We ordered beer and wine, but needed some water.  Our server seemed a bit hesitant and said that the restaurant doesn't have ice. We told him that we didn't mind tap water, and he promptly delivered. We enjoyed leftovers from that nicely sized pizza the next day.  Pure Pizza is a good addition to Plaza-Midwood."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to get my butt over to Pure Pizza.   As a JWU grad I'm a huge Reinhart fan, and was really looking forward to making it here shortly after opening... and somehow my first trip happened in November. Oh well. They were out of gluten free (which is usually just my preference) so we got the sprouted grain. Then we had to order a mushroom after we heard about the man who grows them in his basement, followed by a vegan and a margherita.   Needless to say, the way the bare bones vegan pizza was made said enough. If an almost nothing pizza could be that good, they clearly have the basics down, and everything else should be awesome - and it was.   The only thing not awesome? The $50 for three 12\" pizzas. I understand why, but at the same - seriously??? The honey samples she threw in kind of made up for it I guess. But next time I'll ask for a few more toppings, because when I added olives to my margherita, I ended up with the equivalent of about half of an olive minced and sprinkled on. kinda lame. I did have a nice surprise with the other topping I added, though - the arugula is in sprout form!  I will return, because it's darn good pizza, and if given the choice I'd definitely pay more so I could eat that delicious crust."}
{"text":"We used 30% off restaurant week and even though we had slight problem with getting coupon done with management the workers here let us get half and half done on a pizza even though they don't allow it. I enjoyed the ambiance and the food. I recommend trying the t-rex pizza"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Plaza Midwood. Cool aesthetic and I love the gender neutral bathroom. Go eat here and support local businesses!"}
{"text":"This location doesn't really live up to the downtown location. The pizza is about the same, but the service is slow. In addition, whenever I have been there, I always get a weird vibe. idk. My husband and I usually get the medium margherita pizza, but this location makes you choose from small or large, no in between. Overall, I wouldn't mind take-out from here, but it's not my favorite place to dine in."}
{"text":"This is the best location hands down. This is also the best pizza I have ever had in my life. The crust is crispy, not soggy, and I never feel gross after. They will also give you a little cup of honey to dip your crust in. I never get pizza from anywhere else."}
{"text":"Have really enjoyed Pure Pizza in the past. Tonight there were a few issues with the pizza. My wife and I had the Pure Country pizza. To sum up the pizza - the tomato sauce was like water, no taste and sauce soaked through to the crust. Sauce made crust so moist, it was almost impossible to pick up. The topping included country ham, but it was almost non-existent on the pizza. Pure Country pizza? More like a pure mess."}
{"text":"We LOVE Pure Pizza! Wish we had one closer to our house. We like to walk over to Public Market after going to Imagineon with the kiddo. Pizza is always fresh and tasty! Crust is perfect. The salads are fresh and good also!"}
{"text":"Picked up two calzones the other day. Great service at the counter, quick service. Cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I only ate a sandwich so I can't comment on the pizza. But this review is mostly for my vegan friends out there!   I had the shroom kugel sandwich, which has Daiya vegan cheese melted in it. It was nice and the homemade bread was a great touch. It looked like you could build a pizza too with vegan ingredients but I just tried the sandwich since it was already marked vegan!   I loved the location- it is in a place called 7th street market so you can gets lots of other things while you are there , like sushi, coffee, and a little market to buy sundry items such as jams, salts, veggies, chocolates etc.   Great little vegan spot and I woudk like to come back to also check out the rest of the area - the taps across the way we're a real treat! They had beer of their own, too."}
{"text":"I really want to love pure pizza because they have great owners who support many local causes but I find their pizza a little bland.   The 7th Street public market location is one of the staples of the market and usually has a good beer line up. Don't forget that you can park in their ramp for free (up To 90 minutes) when you validate your parking ticket at one of their stamping machines.  I will say their small pizza is a perfect size for one person and has a hand tossed crust. They also have a gluten free and sprout crust for a dollar more.   They also have salads which look pretty good and I might try one of them next time I'm at one of their locations to see if I like that a bit better.   If you get the wild mushroom pizza I would say you should add garlic or pesto to add some flavor!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with interesting toppings in the Seventh Street Market. And they have local beer on tap, what's not to love?  I got their chorizo topped pizza which also had some cilantro and fresh tomatoes. Made to order, it took a few minutes until it was brought to my table. By that time, I was well into my pint of Triple C's Golden Boy beer. I'll need another of those, please.  Prices are okay ($5 for a local draft is quite reasonable) and there were enough seats around the dinner hour. Note that they do close at around 7pm."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I stopped by for lunch today.  We decided to order two pizza and split them.  We ordered the margarita and the chorizo. The former on the classic crust and the latter on the sprouted grain crust.  Two bottles of cane-sugar Cheerwine on the side finished out our order.  We found a table and waited not even ten minutes and our first pie was out of the oven and on our table.  The margarita was really terrific.  A nice crust with a little char on top.  The chorizo was just as good.  It was not overly spicy and the sprouted grain crust gave off a mild nutty flavor that I found complimentary.  Maybe not so much for the margarita or the pesto, but it worked on this pie.  We did not get the honey that some other yelpers indicated they received, but we'll be sure to get some next time around.  Service was great.  Julie was very pleasant and happy to help.  The kitchen staff was on top of things and they physically would walk the pies out to each table.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, but very, very expensive.   We were overcharged one time as well.  After spending $28 on a pizza we asked for a to-go box and they wanted to charge us for it.    They claimed it was their effort to have less waste and be green.  I get that, but charging for a small box is tacky after charging a premium.   The pizza itself is awesome."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch, my pies are always VERY good - their Neapolitan dough is amazing: thin, yet with a puffy, chewy, & crusty edge.  & I love that they give you honey (the most amazing honey ever) to dip your crust in.  The Five Cheese pizza (fresh & smoked mozzarella, provolone, cheddar, & goat cheese) is an explosion of cheesy goodness in your mouth - awesome how all the flavors come together.  Ordering this and substituting pepperoni for goat cheese is a good combo too.  It's in a great spot, the entire 7th St Market experience is a fun one.  The only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 is that a friend with a gluten allergy tried the T-Rex on gluten-free crust and was less than impressed... he said he's had better at Fuel.  However, they get props for the fact that their gluten-free dough is prepared completely separate to avoid any cross-contamination."}
{"text":"We purchased a $10 for $20 groupon for Pure Pizza and redeemed it yesterday. I got a large takeout pizza, half slap yo mama lasagna and half pesto. I paid $2 extra after pick up but it was worth it. I also asked for some spicy honey dipping sauce in addition to the 2 regular honey sauces that came in the box. The cashier also told me they have bourbon, spicy, regular and cinnamon honey dipping sauces as well.   The pizza itself was thin with a large, thick crust. The pesto was a bit oily and there were a lot of tomatoes on it. The slap yo mama lasagna was yummy but really needed some other veggies like spinach. I think my favorite part about Pure Pizza was that you could really taste the freshness of the ingredients. Yes, they are a bit expensive but its worth it.   I wish I had time to grab the garlic knots, they looked good. 5 are free with check in! The sandwiches also looked good. I'll give them another try when exploring the market place. Cheers!"}
{"text":"It's hard for me to know where to start. But at Pure, I usually start with the Wild Mushroom pizza and don't get much further than that. It's sheer genius...and as a consumer of many a \"wild mushroom pizza,\" I have significant field experience.   Truly a magnificent pizza. I love the execution, and the accompanying video playing on loop that shows where exactly the mushrooms come from...come ON! This little locavore is a happy camper.  I must also give a shout out to the croutons (thanks to a sweet young lady working there who recommended adding them to a salad) as well as the lemon vinaigrette dressing. I'd eat just those two in a bowl and die of delight.  I've tried a few other pizzas there, and they've all been swell.   There's also honey dipping sauce for your crusts...why isn't EVERYONE else doing this? It's so brilliant...and makes the crispy crust taste into a post-slice dessert. The sprouted ancient grain crust is also worth trying...only available in the smaller pizza options, though.  Pure is a favorite of mine when I'm hungry and in the uptown area.    **for the vegans, they have daiya and can make many of the pizzas vegan-friendly with no loss of flavor!"}
{"text":"So it's has been a few weeks since my last Pure Pizza experience and I wanted more of it! We called ahead for pickup and ordered a larger half just cheese for the kids and half goat, feta, fresh mozzarella and bacon for me and the wife! Of course we ordered ten of the garlic knots how could we knot!    The pizza was amazing! So fresh and foldable, covered with toppings, soft flakey crust. Yum! The sauce tasted like it was homemade, the perfect balance of acid and flavor! We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Yelp Charlotte Made event with Pure Pizza, and I finally got a chance to check it out on my own.  The menu is huge, there are so many options--we tried to garlic knots (FREE when you check in on Yelp!) and the smoked salmon pizza. Both were incredible. We really wanted to try something different and signature for Pure, so instead of creating our own pizza we picked one from the menu.  Crust was incredible, plenty of cheese--and when have you had a pizza that tasted like a lox bagel!? Capers and everything. The marinara was homemade and so flavorful--we added it to to the pizza, we couldn't get enough!"}
{"text":"We moved 304 miles to be closer to Pure Pizza (well that is an exaggeration but while I was eating the T-Rex today it felt like the reason we moved back to Charlotte). The Pizza is out of this world, the people are nice, and now the only thing I can't decide is if I like this location or 7th Street. You can't go wrong going to either one."}
{"text":"We have always loved the 7th Street Market and as we watched it grow we usually did it by sitting at one of those tables in the middle of the open space eating a Tyrannosaurus Rex Pizza.  The crust is amazing.  My wife loves the honey they give you to dip the crust into.  I have to say it is absolutely one of the best pizzas I have ever had in Charlotte or anywhere.  It is worth a try and I hope to see you at the table next to us some weekend, watching the market grow."}
{"text":"TRex pizza was great, they honey was a fantastic treat that really elevated the pizza over a other meat heavy pizzas.  Crust was crispy and chewy.  Garlic knots were cooked perfectly with a crispy out and tender inner, did need the marinara that came with them.  They were understaffed but the guy there was polite. Salad ingredients were fresh and crisp.  Definitely my favorite place in the building."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte! Great environment at the 7th Street Public Market. Crust is delicious and they only use the best ingredients. The salads and sandwiches are also excellent but I'm usually a pizza kind of guy."}
{"text":"The margarita pizza will always be my go to, garlic knots are a must, and the honey is outrageous!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Check out the honey with red pepper flakes. The pizzas are to die for. Service is welcoming...On one weekday Pure does half priced bottles of wine which is fantastic! Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"After a couple of beers down the road at Resident Culture brewery, we needed food. Thankfully, just a short walk up the sidewalk is this cool little pizza place. The atmosphere is laid back and friendly. Its a smallish dining room, intimate I would say, but very comfortable feeling. We had Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer and they were yummy. We also got a free garlic knot from our Yelp check in. Lastly, we ordered the Pizza speciality of the day and it was very tasty. They have several craft beers on tap. They also have wine, but I don't think much selection. Overall, I think this is a nice place to grab a pizza that's a little different."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the QC in my opinion.. hands down!!"}
{"text":"After attending one of Yelp Charlotte's \"Made\" series, I went back to the market and had a new appreciation for Pure Pizza.  I have had many instances of eating here and all have been very good.  They range from sharing an afternoon snack with friends, to dining solo during the weekday, or fighting the weekend crowds to hang out at the market.  It's almost as if the 7th Street Public Market is the perfect venue for Pure Pizza.  The casual environment, plus locally sourced ingredients, and the health conscious approach all makes for a delicious and uncompromising local business that I would recommend to anyone visiting or living in Charlotte.    It's amazing so much flavor comes out of that small space they operate out of.  I have been meaning to check out their newly opened 2nd location (stand-alone) on Central.    Order at the counter and you will get a number so that the friendly staff can locate you in the market to deliver your freshly-made pies of amazing-ness.  Your choices range from:  10 inch pizza, 16 inch pizza, or a 9in gluten-free pizza.  Don't forget to put your pan away in the designated spot/bin!"}
{"text":"Okay so we came during lunch and yes there weren't many people. With that being said our service was excellent. Check in on Yelp and get free garlic knots. Their marinara is so good(homemade along with their honey dipping sauces). We got the bourbon honey and the spicy honey. Both were good. I loved the spicy. The bourbon was different as I'm not a brown liquor kinda girl.. Lol!!We had the buffalo chicken pizza and the crust and ingredients are off the chain plus $3 beers on Tuesday was icing on the cake!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We showed up to Pure Pizza for lunch on a Saturday around noon. We came in and a waiter/host looked at us like we were aliens. I spoke up and greeted her since she could not do so. We were told that inside was full and that we could sit outside. We sat outside and waited a while for service. We went inside to see what the deal was and were ignored. We walked down the street to Pizza Peel where we had great service and food/drinks. I will never go back and try the pizza due to the rude and inattentive service!"}
{"text":"Was just in town For a girls weekend and looking for a good pizza joint. Went off of reviews and decided to give pure a shot. They did not disappoint! Great pizza! Fast service! Great atmosphere. Really couldn't get any better!"}
{"text":"I come to 7th Street Public Market at least 2-3 times per month and always think, \"I need to try Pure Pizza\".  Mission finally accomplished last weekend!  To me, one of my first tests of a pizza place is just, how well do they pull off a simple cheese pizza?  Pure Pizza pulls it off very, very well.    This version of the cheeser had perhaps the thinnest crust I've ever had on a pizza with just the perfect amount of crisp and chew.  Still on the crust side, you get a little plastic container of some excellent local honey to dip your remnants in.  The cheese was perfectly brown and melty and stretchy and delicious with a delicious tang you only get from real quality mozzarella and the sauce was fresh and added just the right amount of acid to the pie.   All in all, this was a great pizza and I can't wait to try another variety on another visit to the market."}
{"text":"People are nice. Pizza was super greasy A bit pricy. $10 for a small 12\" - no toppings, only cheese It didn't take long, which was a bonus, but only 6 slices, we were expecting 8, since there were 4 of us, we were going to get 2 slices each."}
