{"text":"Not inexpensive for fish and chips but delicious! The portions are big and you can split with a friend making it affordable. The batter isn't overdone or greasy and the fries are excellent. Recommended for a quick soy outside and grab a bite to eat when you're craving fish and chips"}
{"text":"Reviewed Dish: Halibut and Fries

It's really an unassuming hole in the wall kind of place.
It's more catered to take out crowds, it can probably sit 3 people inside. But there's a table outside the restaurant.
The halibut is so fresh that the meat is still flaky, the batter is so light light and crisp. The finished product is easily the size of 2 pieces of fish anywhere else!
Overall the portion size is more than any other Fish & Chips place I went to, and it tastes incredible.
They even have a hand press to make the fries on the spot, so it's really fresh.

{"text":"Had the haddock and chips. The price was right but the resulting meal was disappointing.

Fish was over battered and a bit overcooked. I can overlook the tartar sauce in packets, but if the fish ain't great, I'm not going to be happy.

Chips were alright but I was too let down by the fish to really notice."}
{"text":"It only took me a year in Toronto before I finally found a good chippy. And this place is good!! Darn good. I guess Canada can make good battered fish. And the owners are very friendly. They know my order before I'm all the way in the little closet of a restaurant. How they stay so happy in the summer when it gets hot in that closet is beyond me, but they are fantastic people and this place makes me glad I'll be in Toronto a little while longer."}
{"text":"Excellent Food 
Primarily take out but have a couple of picnic tables to eat outside
Good value for your $$"}
{"text":"L'endroit est très sympa et les propriétaires sont très gentils. Les frites sont faites entièrement sur place, malheureusement le goût n'est pas très relevé, il faut ajouter vraiment beaucoup de sel et poivre pour sentir quelque chose. La sauce tartare n'est pas bonne du tout et c'est très gras même pour un fish & chips."}
{"text":"Good place for some cheap fish and chips. Chips and tartar sauce could be better but the fish itself is great."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my order. Tons of fries, perfectly cooked, large piece of fish, very crispy batter. I'd give it a 5 if they made their own tartar."}
{"text":"Having spent (some may say suffered) a school terms worth of meals in the UK, I have learned to truly appreciate the simplicity of good fish and chips. Harbord Fish & Chips more than hits the mark. The only thing truly missing are the mushy peas. 

They have haddock and halibut (I always opt for the slightly more pricey latter) in various combination/deals. 2 pieces of fish, chips, coleslaw and a pop will cost you nearly $20 but you will definitely not go away hungry. It's all made-to-order right behind the counter by the wonderfully sweet ma-n-pa couple owner/operators. The batter on the fish is extremely thick and flaky, which I love (but I know some people aren't a huge fan of). 

The packets of tarter sauce leave much to be desired and the fries can be hit-and-miss in their level of \"doneness\" (technical term) but the portions are ultra-generous and they have some of the only coleslaw I'll eat (devour, more like). 

In nice weather the shanty picnic tables crammed out on the sidewalk make for a perfect psuedo-seaside dining experience. Or, opt for the takeout and you can season to your liking before getting your newsprint-wrapped F&C to go."}
{"text":"Sometimes I have daydreams about fish and chips, and in such daydreams, this is where they're coming from.  I'm thankfully far enough from Harbord Fish and Chips that it can remain a once-in-a-while type of treat, but it is delicious enough that I could see eating it more often.

While the outside (and inside, for that matter) are nothing special, the downmarket shop offers what I consider to be the best fish and chips in town. The takeout comes wrapped old-school style in newspaper, and the food is made piping hot to order.  

I like the halibut meal, and have been known to split a two piece meal with a friend considering the huge proportions of food involved.  The fries are generously cut, salty and that perfect combo of just being crispy enough on the outside but soft and mushy inside.  The fish tastes as fresh as you can get from a Maine seashore fish shack, and the batter is nice and golden crispy.  After having this fish I can understand why people loathe ordering pub-style puffy beer battered fish.  It is dreamy, to the point where you might tussle over who gets to eat the last crispy morsels of batter scraps.  Yes, it's that good.  Let's rue the day that the store gets bought out or franchised, and hope that it never comes, because there just aren't enough simple, affordable meals around town these days."}
{"text":"I am from Ireland, I am a potato poet, and I can tell you that Harbord is great for chips.* The chips completely outshine the fish, in my opinion. You guys, they leave the skins ON!!! and they soak the potatoes in cold water first. Their potato etiquette is inspiring.

The most important thing about this place is portion control. One serving of chips will feed a person. If you want fish too, I would say find a buddy and split a large chips (3 scoops instead of 2) and an order of fish. They have some craaaaazy meal deal type things (I think a meal for two is 2xChips, 2xFish, 2xColeslaw and 2xSoda). Yeah, I'd like to see anyone that wouldn't be rendered 'beached' by a meal like that...

There's no room to eat inside here (oh wait, there is that ONE seat!), and just a few picnic tables outside, so get take out or bring it home to eat in front of the telly. Seriously, nothing better than salt and vinegar Harbord and a backlog of Fringe to watch.

*They're not exactly chipper-chips as we call them back home, but looking at them as a standalone product, they are fantastic."}
{"text":"Yuck! How do you mess up something as simple as fish and chips? I guess you use the cheapest ingredients possible. When I opened the newspaper wrapping at home, all I found was cornflakes (formerly batter, but not good batter), some small tasteless pieces of fish, and a bunch of tough fries with a weird oily aftertaste. I used to go here and I found it pretty good, but I guess it's under new ownership. It would be forgivable if it had cost five dollars or so, but at these prices the quality should be better. Next time I'll take the time to go to Kensington market."}
{"text":"My favorite fish & chips in Toronto!  I most often just get the chips and eat them at one of the tables outside, but the fish is pretty good, too.  Beat the Chippy's on Bloor hands down!"}
{"text":"Hmm..for starters my credibility...I'm from New Zealand famous for fish n chips, I worked for 12 yrs in 4 different fish n chip shops (my dads, my cousins-successful, my aunty -failed & my dad's 2nd shop - just passed...lol true story). My dad's 1st shop ran for 30 years & made enough money to feed 5 kids at home & he owns a million dollar property now...so yea it's successful!

I tell you fish n chips shops can't be judged by 1 visit, ideally more times the better shops can have a bad day. Your experience could also be completely ruined due to the fact the frier is due for a change of cooking oil and the owner's are milking it. I am not made of money so I went twice only, but it was enough to say...I caught them on a \"cleaner\" oil day on the 2nd time and at least their service is consistent..very friendly. As for the goods...

as said below you can add the salt, vinegar, sauce etc before they wrap it up..very nice. Chips are really good, undeniably and good portion which also leads to the heavy starch feeling from eating too much. Would give my parent shops a run for their money that alone. Fish batter/content is respectable, not too thick the batter, also fish amount is ok,  Their batter nothing special just complements the halibut, no added flavors like the way we do back at home. Crispy definitely, I didn't even eat it fresh, I walked home for 8mins...but I did my fav trick, just make a solid rip at the top to let it breathe and not let the bag sweat.

I admit first time, the oil was due for cleaning & they didn't even over cook the fish, as I watched...but it still added a unwanted burnt like taste. 2nd time cleaner oil and the problem wasn't as noticeable...only cause I was looking for it...it was even there I reckon.

They are very expensive that's for sure, I question if they can charge less but maybe not...due to unseen circumstances I'd imagine...(inflation, rent & demand). Other places in Toronto I've been charge less but you do get less..in return too...i noticed.

Ideally I 'd prefer to give 3.5 but I can't...it's the prices and by reading below and my experiences, I imagine oil quality is playing a factor. But a 4 is enough, if I was a rich I'd be happy to come here again & again...to make a long distance trip for here...that's another story. Overall this place would be respectable back at home and earning a fair dollar."}
{"text":"The food here is great, albeit a bit more expensive than I was expecting. 
They make everything right there, fresh, in front of you. 
The fries are to die for and the fish is great but a bit too oily for me. 
Although it's a bit pricier than I'd like, you get a HUGE portion and I usually split it 50/50 with my roommate and we're both completely stuffed afterwards. 
It's also such a cute establishment! 
I advise that everyone go there at least once."}
{"text":"Best Fish n Chips in the city!

GIANT pieces and amounts of fries (the two fish one chips is enough for 2 ppl). 

Super-crunchy and golden brown batter. They do halibut, which is a nice step up from Cod/Haddock. 

Take-out place (not much seating inside) but GREAT in the summer, as there are a couple of picnic tables on site."}
{"text":"Little things make a large difference like the way you are invited to season your fries yourself to your liking. Portions are large, fry portions are too large. If you don't mind leftovers that you can turn into poutine, than this is a good problem. 

The owners are friendly and treat everyone like regulars.  

The fish tastes so good you don't really need much tartar sauce with it. The shrimps are also good for a change but the texture of the crunchy batter matches with soft fish better than the firmer shrimp. 


Their french fries are maybe the best in Toronto in my opinion and many others. You can smell potato cooking from outside, not grease. The bottom line is that you can only make good fries from good potatoes and this is where too many fast food restaurants have cheaped out. For $4 or so an order of fries here is big enough to be a meal on its own.

All its missing is poutine, mushy peas and Beatles music."}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall has been around since I was in highschool (Central Tech) in the late 60s.  It's nice to know that the tradition of greasy fish and fries has continued to this day.  Great then (25 cents for a box of fries), just as great today."}
{"text":"Favorite fish and chips in the city.

Not much room for eating indoors, so if it's poor weather...better get take out. Few benches out front. It's tiny inside  - just enough room for a few people to stand while ordering. F&C are wrapped in newspaper, UK style. Pretty cool. Giant portions of fish (go haddock...it's classic) - and the fries are good...but rightfully so only a back up to the fish. Coleslaw is extra but worth it. Harbord Fish and Chips. DO IT."}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews about this joint, decided to give it a try. Big portions but too greasy and over priced. Not sure why everyone likes this place, maybe no other choice nearby"}
{"text":"Nothing like the smell of grease and dinner wrapped in newsprint!

This is a small place that serves up generous portions of deep-fried goodness.  

We were hungry and ordered the dinner for two: 
- 2.5 servings of halibut
- 2 orders of fries
- 2 coleslaws

The pieces of fish were massive!  
The fish was perfectly cooked and the batter was thick, heavy, and super crunchy.  

The fries were good, especially topped with malt vinegar.  If you are getting food to go, they keep packets of the malt behind the counter that you can ask for.  Not a huge fan of the packaged tartar sauce... and we still ran out even though they did give us additional packets.  (I really like the sauces at Chippy's!)

The coleslaw is very soupy... if that's what you like.

The meal was a glorious amount of calories!  
There was so much food that we didn't eat the coleslaw and the half of fish!  

Next time, I might just get a single dinner for myself instead of sharing a dinner for two.  It would end up being a bit cheaper and the perfect amount of food.

I enjoyed my fish and chips, but this place is not top of my list for F & C places."}
{"text":"Obviously not as good as Halifax fish & chips (alone well worth the flight!) but still good. Harbord has taken the british style, deep frying a lightly battered filet of fish instead of using a heftier (and more delicious) batter. But it's still an awesome ton of greasy food wrapped in newspaper which hits the spot if it's what you're craving. Great for takeaway and just as nice for eat-in if it's nice out and you can take advantage of the picnic tables out front. It still leaves me yearning for home, but in a pinch it's just fine."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place once a week because it's so damn good. I don't understand all the negative reviews this place is getting. The nice Chinese couple who run this place know their fish and chips. The size of the fish they give you is incredible, the batter has the appropriate crunch, the fish is well protected inside the crusty shell, and the fries are some of the most addictive fries I've ever had.

For those complaining about the oil and grease, did you forget you were eating fish and chips?

I\"ve also been to Chippy's on Queen - but you can't even compare. The fish fillets they use are small, thin, sad looking pieces of fish that get destroyed in the fryer. 

For those complaining about the tartar sauce: it's nothing to complain about. Unless they elevate tartar sauce to the next level, I don't see the problem in using packets of Heinz tartar sauce and it certainly doesn't detract from the fish and chips itself (in fact, it adds a lot regardless of whether it is pre-made tartar sauce and thats what matters right?). My bet is if the Heinz tartar sauce was served from an unbranded dispenser that read 'organic' and 'hand-crafted', some of the reviews would've been very different.

Also, this place is very unassuming (just like the owners) so anyone can feel comfortable eating here like in a proper neighbourhood chip shop. You order in the tiny shop and then sit by the crappy wooden tables outside. It's casual, and it's what fish and chips is meant to be."}
{"text":"This place is not a restaurant.

It is a gallery.

The only piece it contains is the poster by the door to the right of the counter."}
{"text":"Nice family owned place. It's been here for a long time and the quality is still very good, sure the prices are a bit high but it's a nice treat once in a while. 

I've been coming here for a while, and it still one of my favourite fish places in toronto."}
{"text":"For delicious downtown fish n chips it's yum. 

Cute seating outside, don't even remember seeing seats inside, but there might be a couple chairs...

The fish is deeeelish!"}
{"text":"A cozy tiny fish shack on Harbord Street. Although I love the greasish smells wafting from their walls, I find their fish and chips to be a bit of too much puffed up batter with not much fish inside. :( Also the packets of tartar sauce aren't really tasty....but the KFC style coleslaw is a taste guilty pleasure! Fries aren't bad, sometimes undercooked but you do get a lot of 'em."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place and was excited to check it out.

Unfortunately it was way too greasy and fried to really enjoy it. Just explain, I do enjoy lots of fried things at other places. 

Such as shame."}
{"text":"Harbord Fish and Chips is a small brick hut that looks out of place compared to some of the fancier establishments on Harbord. Once you walk in though you find a nice couple cooking delicious fried fish and thick french fries.

You can get either Halibut or Haddock and the fries are home made. Everything is very tasty and all the usual condiments are available, although the tartar sauce only comes in packets. A meal here will probably set you back $15-$20 but the portions are very large. If you're in the market for some good fish and chips, you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"After eating here, there was a funny taste in my mouth. It was a bit too greasy and I could not get the lingering taste from my mouth even after brushing my teeth."}
{"text":"My overall experience there was much like Sam's. Its a bit pricey, very very simple (spartan), and on the ambiance scale a zero. The fish is good, but there are many other places in that league. Seating is only available on very old picnic tables outside...not a terrace!"}
{"text":"Really good fish and chips. Cool little restaurant with more pick nic tables than seating.

I really enjoyed the halibut fish. Tasted great and a lot bigger than an average fish and chips dish.

The negatives were the tar tar sauce. Wasn't terrible but just came in packets so nothing special. Tar Tar sauce is pretty important with fish and chips so would liked to have something better than just packets of it. Same goes with the fries. Again nothing terrible but also nothing special. 

All in all i would recommend trying Harbord fish and chips. It's not the best but better than average. If i could i'd give this place three and a half stars."}
{"text":"L-O-V-E Harbord Fish & Chips and find myself here (shamefully) at least once a week! 
My sidekick & I split a single halibut & chips w/ 2 pops (about $16) and it's plenty for us to both feel full but not bursting. The fish portion is quite large, and they are super generous with their fries. 
It's a tiny spot with 2 or 3 stools inside and 4 picnic tables outside. I just love coming here and eating under their awning, watching the Harbord st traffic go by. 
A family operation, staff are super friendly and always happy to see us.
I've never taken fish to go so I can't vouch for how well it travels .
Cash only. 
Ps. The west wall is painted baby blue and blooms with hot pink cosmos all summer - v. instagrammable! :)"}
{"text":"Most of the time when I feel a hankering for fish & chips and don't feel like taking the trek out to my fav spot B&B i'll head over to to Harbord to get my fix. It's a small place but they at least they have benches for you to enjoy your f&c and people watch. 

When I go there I always get the haddock, not only is it cheaper then halibut but the results turn out better. The time I tried the halibut it was overcooked and tough, in that the moisture had come out of the fish but the batter retained it so it was wet but biting into it was like biting into a sponge. After that I only ordered the haddock and I've been satisfied with the results so that's my fish of choice from now on (plus it's bigger too, which is a bonus). The fries are good, I hate to admit this but they do fries better then B&B's in that they have that crispiness on the outside but still moist on the inside, consistenly too. Cole slaw is extra so I've never tried it and tartar sauce is from packets, which you kind of expect. Prices are pretty much in line with most other f&c places, coming out to a little north of $10 and the owners are a friendly couple so how can you not support them :)

Good place to go to when the weather's nice."}
{"text":"Two & a half stars.

I'm still chugging Pepto Bismol to help me get over the greasy stomach overload of Harbord Fish & Chips.  Don't get me wrong, when eating fish & chips I expect a level of greasiness.  About three bites into the fish and I knew I was in trouble.  If this had been Texas I'd have mounted a little oil rig right on top of my basket of food and exclaimed \"we've hit oil!\".  (urp)  Maybe I've just been spoiled by the incredible fish & chips I ate at the Golden Hind in London, England.  

A couple of comments to add;  First off being oily is one thing but when you can taste the oil its definitely time to change the cooking fat.  This was the case last night.  The upside was that it was a lovely evening weather wise so we sat outside with some other Yelpers and enjoyed a few minutes of the last of the seasonal weather.  

I don't think I'd be going back to Harbord F&C's, at least not without a good supply of Tums, Rolaids and Pepto Bismol in hand."}
{"text":"Something about this place makes me like it. Maybe it's the incredibly small and cozy feel to it. This little shack on Harbord spits out Fish & Chips of really good quality. I feel it really is one of the best Fish & Chips places in the downtown area (closely competing with Chippy's Fish & Chips on Bloor & Bathurst). 

There's just something about this place that when you walk into it, you really feel like you're sea-side and the server is a sea captain serving you fresh fish. The fish then come wrapped in newspaper and filled with fine chips. 

Although this isn't a fancy place (obviously) so don't expect TOO much but if you're craving really good normal fish and chips for a good price then you've definitely found the place!"}
{"text":"Minimalist fish 'n' chips at a sit down restaurant price point. Staff is friendly and earnest. You get a nice portion. But looking around the overhead seems terribly low and the prices seem terribly high."}

{"text":"I bike by here almost every day on my way to work and have been serenaded enough times by the smell of delicious fish and chip grease that I just had to try it. I wasn't disappointed. 

First off, it's cash only. Leave your credit cards at home but bring your ATM card and use the machine across at the laundermat.

Secondly, there's no indoor seating, only pic nic tables, and...

Third of all, the prices are a wee bit higher, but....

THE FISH AND CHIPS ARE DELICIOUS.

That wasn't an accidental CAPS LOCK, it was legitimately that good. The batter isn't too thick or bready, even though I like thick batter. The piece of fish was enormous, it may well have been an entire fish. The chips are double fried and taste great. It is a bit greasy but....it IS fish and chips. Health food fanatics, stay clear. 

My whole meal of haddock and chips with a 7Up was under $15. The owners are nice people and greet you with a smile and thank you for your patronage, a rarity today as business sometimes feels assumed not appreciated. 

I'll be there again. And again. And again.

GO!"}
{"text":"I love yelp.

50% of reviews \"batter is too heavy\"
50% of reviews \"batter is too light\"

I love the additional people \"they waste condiments\" (NO you wasted them by not giving them back)

\"Portions are OK/too small/too big/but you wont leave hungry\" - I have the appetite of a Blue Whale, I did not leave hungry, and given the amount of food i ate, I almost didn't make it out of the picnic bench.

\"too expensive\" - for a pound of fries and half pound of Halibut you paid $11. Unreal. If you bought the same ingredients at Pusateris or St Lawrence Market, you wouldn't have money left to buy oil to fry it all in.

Review:

This is the kind of place that everyone is so happy with their food that everyone just started talking to eat other rather than pounding the food in their face. 

Its amazing. 
Yes, the people are lovely. When I asked for my tartar sauce, they happily coughed it up. The spot is amazing. The food is so incredibly good, that I just want it everyday. Its different from other fish and chip places, the batter has a lot of flavor, rather than just crunch.

My wife ordered the fried shrimp, which I tried desperately to finish for her. FOR HER.

It must be so hard for 'foodies' to eat out, when they have seen so many pretty pictures of food.

I would eat here often if I didn't live in fear of needing a new wardrobe."}
{"text":"The fact that this place only has three stars saddens me, as it's actually the best fish and chips place around.

First and foremost the chips are to die for. The perfect texture  crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, always browned to perfection and  they also keep the skins on - the only way to each french fries. They let you season them as you wish with malt vinegar, salt, etc. 

It's always super fast and you get to watch your fish fry right in front of you. A bit greasy, but the batter is light and super crispy. Plus the couple that man this place work together in perfect harmony, he fries the fish while she gets the fries sorted. Sooo cute. Always wrapped in paper - usually the Toronto Star and you're good to go.

Finally, the 'slaw. Sooo good. It's the perfect amount of sweetness and liquidiness for 'slaw. Try some!

To me this joint is more a summer place since seat-age is only outside however, I've discovered they are in fact open in winter just not on Sunday's - SCORE. More than anything this place is a wonderful summer treat. Don't go if you're into counting calories though, this place isn't for you.

n.b. Should totally be noted they give you tons of fries and fish. Either split them with a friend or know there's no way you'll finish your meal."}
{"text":"A delightful little, I mean little, gem in the annex. Fresh fish, an avalanche of fries and a cold pop to wash it all down. Best fish and chip place west of Yonge."}
{"text":"This tiny place is lovely, inside and out. The exterior looks like an aged fish joint on a wharf. It's ran by an elderly Chinese couple, which makes it extra cute. The place can fit about 3-4 people, but takeouts are recommended as it is no place for social gathering.

And the fish and chips. Based on the reviews some people love it and some hate it, and I belong to the first group. The batter is crispy and breaks apart easily, and I love the lightness/flakiness of it, whether it's done right or not.

There are two types of fish available, haddock and halibut. I personally prefer halibut which has more soft texture and mild taste to it but haddock is also good and slightly cheaper.

Once the fish is ready, you are invited to put salt/pepper and vinegar on the fish and chips as you prefer, which is then wrapped in sheets of newspapers.

The only downside, unless you have a jar of decent tartar sauce at home, is that the packaged tartar sauce they give you is not really good. But their in-house coleslaw is awesome, so just get one or two coleslaw on the side!"}
{"text":"Clearly some mixed feelings about this place according to other reviews. 

The halibut was okay but a little too over breaded, and a little too greasy. It did have some good flavor though, and the fries were pretty decent. 

Overall not bad, and be aware that they do not except credit card or debit! I learned that the first time."}
{"text":"Great service. 

Pricey but you get A LOT to eat, easily shared between two.  The food is a good, quick fix. 

The fries are decent, perhaps better enjoyed if they are eaten on site. Mine are usually a bit smoshed when I get around to eating them. I can only stomach the grease from this meal about once a season but it's worthy of repeat business.

I like that the takeaway is packaged like the Brits do it, in newspaper :)

Give this place a try at least once."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hole in the wall. Not a thing in here is younger than 15years old, maybe even the oil. Walk into this fish shack and you have an extensive menu consisting of fish and chips. 

As small as the restaurant is inside, each and every piece of floor space either has a chair or table occupying it. If the weather is nice I would opt to sit outside as you won't walk away smelling like 15year old oil and french fries. Service from the fryman was pretty great. He was super friendly and as accommodating as he could possibly be. 

The food was lack luster. The portions look amazing and the size of fish was large and the amount of fries were more than what I could handle. Although the fish seemed large, it consisted of mostly batter. I found the batter too light and crispy and it soaked up the grease like a sponge so each and every bite would release even more grease. The fries were undercooked but you do get plenty of them.

Overall, the fish and chips are not worth traveling for. You get better fish and chips at a chain restaurant, quite the shame as fish and chips are the only things this place does. It came out to $12 for one piece of fish and a truckload of fries, if quantity is your game then its a winner but I can't justify the price for what you get."}
{"text":"Really good fish and chips place on Harbord. And it's very small inside only has about two seats so plan to take away. The fish is so battered it leaves that film of oil on the roof of your mouth when you're done. Good price and good food!"}
{"text":"Sorry, Harbord F & C - but I have to update my review.   I WANT to like this place.  I wish their fish was good.  But it's not.

Now - I must say - they are very pleasant.  Happy to see a customer and friendly.  But this fish is just plain bad.  Sometimes it is worse than others.  The last time I was there it was rather pathetic.  Especially after I have started to experience GOOD fish and chips (like at SeaWitch on St. Clair - west of Bathurst.)

But again - with my last visit - the batter was hard and dark and crusty and fell off the fish - and it was thin - and it seemed like the oil needed changing - or something.

Such a shame that the old couple that work there are so nice - and the fish just isn't.

Previous review:

Somewhat disappointing.  Expensive and the batter fell off almost all the fish.  The batter was dark and too crispy - and it seemed as though the oil may have needed a change.  Fries were fair.

They waste condiments.  Shame.  I didn't want any ketchup - but they didn't ask - and gave me about 7.  I got about 10 tartar, 6 vinegar, and LOTS of salt and pepper - almost all of which were wasted.

So much for the environment.

2 orders of fish, one fry, and 8 shrimp cost $38"}
{"text":"All in all its OK, perhaps not quite \"A-OK\" but I'll round up.

The food is rather heavy, and the fish to batter ratio is a little disappointing.  Tastes fine for oily food.  Fries complement the fish well.  Prices are good.  $22.50 tax in for a dinner for two which is 2.5 fish (the haddock / cheaper of the two), 2 fries servings and two little coleslaws.  You won't leave hungry... but ... \"leaving not hungry\" after a meal is a pretty low bar to set.

One extra star because we had three people and after ordering the dinner for two the guy put our servings (unsolicited) into three different plates, which I appreciated.  The funny thing was that since there was a dinner for 4 and dinner for 2 we asked if we could basically get a \"dinner for three\" which they wouldn't sell however the dinner for 2 is more than enough for three people."}
{"text":"I don't get it. When I first walked into this petite isolated whitewashed building, I thought I was in for a treat. The cute aquamarine sign and letterboard menu were endearing. The fact that this entire business could fit inside a shipping container gave me hope. Noting that there was seating for fewer than five people made me feel like a VIP for even getting in. But their foodstuffs changed everything.

The fish was small, over-battered, over-fried and not really tasty at all. The packets of Heinz tartar sauce were a bit insulting too. I'm no chef, but I can muster a quick tartar sauce. Fries were the only decent part of the meal, but a bit soggy for my liking.

Though the service was quick and friendly, I'm hesitant to return.

Obligatory Title Pun: In this case: CUT BAIT.

Menu Readability: Cute.

Need to mention: They do have a couple picnic tables out front too.

What this place teaches me about myself: Heck yeah, I can make tartar sauce."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this authentic looking place after a glowing review from a friend. Prices were definitely on the high side, but I remained intrigued. We ordered the 4 person haddock dinner to go. 

Upon unwrapping the newspaper each portion was wrapped in, I was pleased with the portion size. Unfortunately, the batter was heavy, the fish itself tasteless,  the tartar sauce in tiny purchased packets, and the Cole slaw soggy, oddly colored and finely minced. Huge dissapointment from this place. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall sort of place. THe price was quite reasonable for the amount of food one received. Also the fish and chips were wrapped in newspaper which is a nice touch. T he chips wee also quite good. Nothing spectacular but good. The fish however was overcooked and battered. I felt like I got very little fish for my dollar. The tatar sauce was also just from packets. and not very good. I would recommend other fish and chip shops in the near by area over this one."}
{"text":"After acquiring two good Scottish friends, I learned how to stop thinking haddock is gross and love the chippy.

This chippy is around the corner from my house and was recommended by a friend. A Scottish friend and I made tracks and ordered one fish (because I was afraid of eating it) and two orders of fries (because I am not afraid of potatoes) and dove into a plate of grease, fried batter, and culture shock.

The fish here at Harbord is really good because the batter used is light and airy and does not overwhelm any other part of the meal. It is also possible to simply order fish without fries (!), which is what I opt for these days because I find the fries disappointing and the meal expensive.

After making it to Scotland myself, I brought back with me a very handy bottle of HP brown sauce which completely transforms the entire experience and makes it even more delicious that even thought possible. If you have any idea what I am talking about, well, good.

As for the ambiance, sure, there's none, but that's why I like it. It's literally a brick shack on the street with a cute sign and interesting clientele, just like the chippies back in the UK.

If you're looking for a fancier and more authentic chippy with full chippy accessories, head up to Chippy's on Bloor, where you can get battered salmon and mushy peas!

PS Yelp asked me if this place is good for kids and my initial reaction was no - this is not a healthy meal by any means!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the huge fuss about this place is. 

I was really excited to come to this place after hearing rave reviews. I was very disappointed. 

I'm sort of biased on the fact that I'm from the coast, but compared to Chippy's in Toronto -- this place needs some work. 

I got the 2 piece and shared it with somebody else. They put it on 2 separate plates which was nice of them -- the portions looked HUGE---------- until we bit into them. Batter Batter Batter, and not even the good kind of batter. I was fighting the flakes to find my fish! In fish and chips -- fish should definitely  be the star of the dish , not the deep fried batter. 

It was extremely greasy and hard to eat. 

Don't even get me started on the their tarter sauce. If you have this big of a reputation, you still feel the need to get HEINZ packets of Tarter sauce which are messy and a disaster and terrible tasting? Not even a bottle... Packets. Tarter sauce is one of the easiest sauces to make, and so delicious when it's fresh. Heinz? Really?"}
