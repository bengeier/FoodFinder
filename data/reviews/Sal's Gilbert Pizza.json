{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time! Yummy! I am stuffed. Loved the garlic knots as mentioned before, also the antipasto was great! Good sized pieces of the yummy Italian meats you want in an antipasto. Pizza was great too and I am a picky Ny'er when it comes to pizza. Would have liked the crust to be a bit crispier, but it was still delicious! My son is still eating his kid's spaghetti as well! Tons of pasta for $5!! Did I mention I loved the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"This isn't just \"five stars for a family pizzeria.\"  This is \"five stars for any place on earth.\"  Introduced by a local friend, I've been here four times and every single thing I have eaten has been above and beyond delicious.  Start w/ the complimentary garlic knots - fresh, warm, not over-spiced or too oily.  The pizzas are solid and homemade.  But the specialty items are TO DIE FOR.  One of the best penne vodka sauces I have ever had; melt-in-your-mouth arrencini; and gnocchi the texture of marshmallows (the ideal texture, often not achieved in places where the dish costs 4x as much).  Sal's is a place I would take out-of-towners.  The staff is super friendly, the atmosphere clean and respectable, but the food is truly among the best I have ever had.  Come for the pizza - but order other stuff and be prepared to have your taste buds bedazzled."}
{"text":"This is the best place great food ,great poeple ,you can not find any place like sals for verity of pizza like , Marsalis pizza ,lasagna pizza ,spaghetti pizza ,or just your regular pizza ,great meatball and eggplant parmigiana sandwich, we go there at least two or three times month,owner always there to greet you.five star."}
{"text":"This is the real thing -- pizza just like they serve at those little storefront pizzarias in New York City.  Only it is in Gilbert, Arizona.  I've been living in Los Angeles (previously in Manhattan) for over two years and it is a revelation to find real New York pizza somewhere --  anywhere! -- within 500 miles of my new home. 

It's the dough -- slightly dry, slightly starchy, slightly charred on the bottom. Sauce that is just the right balance of sweet and acid -- no \"Chef Boy-ar-dee\" taste like the national chains.  The Sicilian was a whopper of a slice, stiff on the bottom, chewy yet buttery layers of sauce and cheese on top.  

The only thing missing is a grape drink!  I'm taking two pies to go, and will be back."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, I've seen all these wonderful reviews about Sals and maybe got my expectations up. Ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and was disapointed when I got home. 
I found only 10 slices of pepperoni on a 14\" pizza. Come on man, don't be so chintzy."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! They have amazing lunch specials you can't pass up! The owners are so friendly and service is always exceptional. Definitely a regular here and will continue to be!"}
{"text":"One of two of my favorite Italian restaurants in the SE Valley. Great food, good prices, casual atmosphere. Some evenings there is a wait, especially on weekends.  Mid week we usually get right in.
I believe the owner has been in the kitchen every time we have been there and the food reflects that.  If you want an authentic Italian food this is the spot.  After trying the lasagna and chicken fettuccine alfredo it will be difficult to ever return to any of the larger chain Italian restaurants around here."}
{"text":"I was going to take a before picture of my pizza but then thought, ain't nobody got time for that. Best pizza in town hands down."}
{"text":"Update: This place has really gone downhill! They screwed up my order, which is understandable (it happens). The main problem was I had two pizzas, both were under-cooked. The dough was like playdough right underneath the cheese. The garlic knots had almost no taste to them. Unfortunate that things have gotten this bad, I felt like Chef Gordon Ramsay because everything I tasted was bland or cooked wrong...I hate to give out low ratings, but this place deserved it."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Sal Gilbert pizzeria for the last 10 years and have nothing but good experiences at that restaurant. The pizza is authentic New York style pizza as good as any pizzeria back home.. I've had the lasagna the calamari spaghetti and meatballs eggplant parmesan baked ziti pizza everything I have had on the menu has been perfectly cooked to perfection.. the staff has always been friendly and helpful and sal is a very good chef very pleasant and friendly and I recommend this restaurant to everybody and anybody that I see when we start talking about pizza and Italian restaurants.. Sal and staff keep up the great work"}
{"text":"The pizza is good but the seating and the service leave quite a bit to be desired.  Although there were tons of servers nobody seemed to be looking after the customers.  You self serve for drinks but are out of luck if you want water or iced tea: water is behind the counter and the tea was perpetually empty.  I was glad I went with a groupon and didn't pay full price"}
{"text":"We were completely ignored on Sunday. It doesn't take much effort to at least acknowledge someone and say \"Someone will be right with you\""}
{"text":"Had the lasagna and the wife had the ravioli. Both were great! The meal came with both salad and knots. The location is in a cute area. Staff is friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best damn pizza hands down!!!!! Thanks Sal! My family tried several of their offerings today. My 1st few slices were the baked ziti pizza then grandmas pizza and my last attempt was a slice of Sicilian, corner of course. The crust was nice and crisp and the sauce was just right not too little, not too much. Hold that order of extra marinara because this guy got it right. Out of the 5 different types of pies our favs were Grandma's and the Ziti. I'm pretty sure I would of had another favorite but got too full."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible:
Service: slow with a don't-care attitude
Food: wrong pizza and extremely salty
Thin crust: uuhhm, if 1\" means 'thin' ......
Price: ridiculously high

What really got me was their no-care attitude. Soda machine ran out of product: yeah, we really don't give a flip.... Get something else, we're not here to help you.

Then I got the bill and I was charged like I was in a real restaurant in stead of a glorified gas station.. 

Don't go there!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious all the time, all around! Definitely my favorite pizza by far. Favorite is the pasta rigatoni red sauce pizza."}
{"text":"This is real food! How can anyone say its bad food. This isn't a fancy place it's a just a good good place. The people there are nice. I think sal is the owner, super nice guy."}
{"text":"This place was great. Few places leave wanting to try lots of items in their menu, but this one was just awesome. I can't wait to go back. The service was great. We waited for a little for a table, but nothing out of the ordinary. I definitely will be giving them my business over and over."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, I compare everything to real NY pizza and this is the closest I have found that is still open/in business. Drove a half hour out of the way for the pizzas, so they were not fresh out-of-the-oven hot by the time we had them. But, they were easily warmed under broiler. The Sicilian with sausage was good, but a little too dough-y for the cheese/dough ratio. But, the fact that they even know what a Sicilian pie is, they get points for that. So, maybe 6 out of 10 for that one.
The baked ziti pie is an easy 10 out of 10. The sauce is good and that is not easy to do. It was not bitter like most places have. I did over-estimate the amount needed, so half of the pizza became leftovers and was re-heated the next day. Ignore the pizza part, the baked ziti was good on its own. That is what I will get next time I go back. I keep harping on the sauce, but it was really the best part- good cheese/sauce/ziti mix.

I did pick the food up and it was a Saturday night, but the place was packed, waiting line sitting awaiting open tables, and I knew it was a good place judging by that. I always go to the Greek place next door and we always meet in the parking lot and say, \"Pizza this time? Nah, Greek food (again).\" Next time, pizza!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the BEST pizza place in Arizona we have ever been too. The garlic knots and fried zucchini are AMAZZZZZZZZING! We drive about 30 minutes from east Queen Creek just to eat here! The pizza and the pasta in a garlic sauce is pretty darn good too! Yummm!"}
{"text":"I'm Italian, and I'm used to not being able to find authentic Italian food when traveling. Until now. Sal's is the real deal. From the amazing, delicious, piping hot garlic knots all the way to the cannoli dessert. 

I was staying in Gilbert for a few days with a family member who was raving about Sal's. I was a little skeptical about finding high quality Italian in a suburb of Phoenix, but figured I'd be open minded. Thank god I did. 

We ordered wings-mild- which had the perfect saucy heat. Then, meat lovers pizza. COVERED in all the best meats. All the while snacking on those garlic knots- easily the best I've ever had outside of New York. 

Then, as a thank you for coming in- a plate of amazing cannoli's. If ever again I'm in Gilbert- Sal's will be my first stop."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant and began by ordering garlic knots and mozeralla sticks. Regardless of them being hot after the first bite, they tasted good. After letting them cool down for a minute or so, they were fine. We ordered a pizza with a variety of toppings. We didn't finish the pizza, but it was delicious enough to take home. The service was good due to the waitress being patient and kind."}
{"text":"This is THE best family-owned pizzeria in town, easy. 

The BEST medium wings.

The BEST antipasto salad.

The BEST meatball subs.

The BEST chicken marinara subs.

The BEST cheese pizzas.

Need I say more?"}
{"text":"After a long day of solving world problems, I search Gilbert for Italian subs and Gilbert Pizza came up. I went there and ordered 2 delicious sandwiches. Customer service was great and the food was yummy. I am defiantly going there again."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some delicious pizza. Very short wait time and the garlic knots are amazing!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place a lot. The reviews said the service was terrible, but they must be reading these reviews, because that was not our experience at all. Walked in and was greeted with a hello right away. Both my wife and I and the kids loved the pizza. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. Real NY Italian food. The veal parm is fantastic as well as the chicken parm. Owners and staff are great people. Service is fantastic as well. This is without a doubt the best Italian food in the valley."}
{"text":"Use to come here often. Had the worst service ever this evening. Food took over an hour. No apology from server or owner. Was simply told by server that she doesn't control the kitchen. Will never return and will spread the word about lack of service."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the 1st time yesterday. Loved that they had quick pizzas by the slice available as well as a menu with more choices. We ordered a calzone which was very delicious. Owners were interacting with customers and Grace was very sweet to us. Definitely would go there again, food and service was great."}
{"text":"Sals food is top notch! One of the best if not the best chicken Parms I've had. And I'm spoiled being from Chicago close to little Italy and this place is right there with them if not better!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! Best New York style pizza ever!!! Feel like I'm home in NYC when I come here. Doesn't disappoint !!"}
{"text":"I love sals!. Great atmosphere for dining in. Excellent staff. Pricing is about what it should be. Very fresh food, love the garlic knots:) we usually get ours to go \"family special\" only drawback is there's no delivery. I recommend giving this family establishment a shot. You won't be disappointed:)"}
{"text":"Second visit this afternoon. Just as good as the first! Love the baked ziti pizza! If you haven't been here, you definitely need to add it to your list to visit."}
{"text":"If I could give Sal's Gilbert pizza a 10 star review I would! By far the best pizza and pasta I have ever had in Arizona! 
We placed and order for an extra large pizza half lasagna half traditionist, a full order of the cheese ravioli's with vodka sauce which comes with garlic knots and a side salad and a large chocolate dipped cannoli. 
The lasagna pizza was the best combination of cheese, meat, sauce and noodles! It was so filling and cooked to perfection. The traditionist pizza was loaded with pepperoni and so much cheese! The cheese ravioli were jumbo and absolutely delicious! The vodka sauce was truly out of this world!!! The side salad was surprisingly large and the garlic knots were warm and doughy! 
My fiancé is not a huge fan of cannoli's but Sal's chocolate dipped cannoli changed his mind and said that it was the best cannoli he has ever had! I can not wait to explore the rest of the menu! 
I will definitely be back again and again to enjoy the amazing authentic Italian cuisine that Sal's Gilbert Pizza has to offer!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night and it was PACKED, the wait time was an hour so we left. So we went back a few weeks later at 9PM and only had to wait maybe 15 minutes. It isn't a super fancy place, but I personally liked the casual atmosphere.  I am from NY, and this place is LEGIT with their Italian food. They had AMAZING garlic knots (be prepared to smell really delicious afterwards) and the chicken parm I got was really really good.  Their marinara sauce is so rich of fresh tomatoes. My husband got the clam garlic linguine pasta dish and he loved his as well.  Not super expensive, $30 total for 2 people who left extremely full and very happy.  The only reason why I'm not leaving 5 stars is because I think for the popularity of the place, they could expand a little and provide more seating options so the wait time isn't so long."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal and it's no wonder why it was on diners drive-ins and dives. The bruschetta is to die for and pizza is very unique as long as you are willing to venture out a bit. Definitely a good spot to take visitors."}
{"text":"This is my favorite New York style pizza joint! Delicious dinners and excellent service. I love supporting good mom and pop restaurants!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had.  The owners are very nice and make you feel at home.  I always order the garlic knots and the white pizza.  I don't know where they get their cheese but it is amazing.  The crust is very good and it is fun to watch them toss the pizza.  They have a few good beers on tap and some decent wine as well.  The manicotti is also delicious.

The owners are from Italy and ran a Pizza shop in NY City for many years.  It is the real deal.  If you want great pizza you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Best NY style pie in Phoenix. I've seen some reviewers complain about the service; I haven't experienced that at all. But then again I went in knowing it was a NY style joint. I'm not prissy mama's boy thats has to waited on hand and foot. Give me my pie, give me a beer and leave me alone. The pizza here stand on it's own."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great garlic knots! I've gotten slices and knots at lunchtime and its goood"}
{"text":"We tried Gilbert Pizza for the first time last night.  We enjoyed the complimentary garlic knots while we poured over the menu.  So many choices.  We flipped a coin and decided on our old fave: Ham and Pineapple Pizza.  The crust was thin and crispy (yum) but next time we'll have to ask for \"light cheese\".  Too much for our liking.  There were lots of families in the place and the kids seemed to be loving it!  So next time, light cheese, extra sauce and we'll probably try the Ziti Pizza."}
{"text":"This was the first time i have been here. Glad I did not rush to try this place. Like others the Self serve soda station was odd and no water spout. That is the least if their problems. service is horrible. They have three waitresses there but basically no one helps you or checks on you. Food  was just ok. Don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Service is now poor due to the fact they expanded their dining room. Hire more help please."}
{"text":"Went to Sal's on a Monday and it was packed with a 45 minute wait for a table. Lot's of people picking up orders to go. It sure helped the business to have Guy Fieri do a segment on the Food Channel. The wait staff is adequate but were really having to push it to keep up with the crowd. The pizza is the best in the area, it has a great crust and the ingredents are fresh and flavorfull. We had a cesar salad as a appetizer and they serve garlic knots when you are seated which are free. The best thing about eating their pizza besides the taste is that the carbs in the crust doesn't make your blood sugar spike which is someting I find I have a problem with many of the other pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"This was the best NY Style pizza I've had in AZ. But what I really loved about this place was watching customers come in and the staff greet them by name. That is priceless! Customer loyalty is big in my book, and a vendor (obviously a family--and an Italian one, at that) who takes the time to get to know their customers earns extra points.

The fact that the food was delicious is important too! I took my daughter and her friend in for a slice the first time we visited--I'd heard very good things, so I was anxious to try it. The girls had cheese pizza (as 4 year olds usually do), and I ordered a whole pie with extra cheese and sausage to take home for the hubs. However, the pizzas by the slice caught my eye--they had one with rigatoni on it, a philly cheesesteak one, mushroom, etc. etc. etc. But what I couldn't pass up was the chicken pesto, so I ordered a slice. Heaven on a plate. The chicken was tender, the pesto was smooth, basily (is that a word?), and I think there was alfredo sauce on it too. It was absolutely delicious. The whole pie was fab, too--definitely NY style, and my East Coast native husband was thrilled! 

We'll be back FOR SURE. They have a private room for parties...I'm thinking my daughter's birthday might be the perfect occasion!"}
{"text":"Sal's Gilbert pizzeria amazing!  The owners are excellent people with great heart ! Today I Ate a shrimp tortellini alfredo that was delicious.  Their lasagna is ummmm a dream and the garlic knots to die for. I totally recommend Sal's pizzeria !"}
{"text":"I'm a Band Mom. On two separate occasions last year our kids were left without meals due to logistical issues. Both times Sal's Gilbert Pizza came through on a grand scale. Sal gave us great pricing on what has now become our kids' favorite meal when performing in the Gilbert area. Sal's is awesome. The smell when you walk in the door is enough to make your mouth water. Every single staff member was kind and courteous. Sal hooked us up with pasta, meatballs and garlic knots. Due to our situation he also provided plates, napkins and serving utensils. Sabino High School Marching Band and Color Guard LOVE Sal's Gilbert Pizza. See you on Saturday!"}
{"text":"We were told by some friends that have been here 4 times to definitely try this place out.  They said that Sal's has great pizza, baked ziti & lasagna.  They also told us that they often share a bottle of the cabernet that is $22.  They told us that Sal even came out to their table and greeted them on occasion.  So, we decided to give it a try. 
It was my friend's birthday today.  We were on our way home from the Tempe Art's Festival.  We went in so excited and hungry for some good Italian food.  

We walked in, not really sure of the protocol to seat ourselves or wait.  After a few minutes, someone from the back yelled \"hello\".  Eventually, they asked \"dining in or take out?\"  When we answered, they told us to just take a seat.  My friend Stacy needed to use the RR.  She went and I sat down.  A lady came by and set 2 plastic glasses on the table & a small plate with 5 knots.  I was very hungry, so I tried a piece.  Very, very good.  When Stacy arrived back from the RR she said she needed her sweatshirt from the car.  I told her that I would go get it after we ordered.  Well, we waited, waited & waited.  Did I mention we waited?  Finally, I went up to the take out window and asked, \"do I come here to order?\"  She said \"no, I will be right over.\"  Eventually, she made it.  When I had gone up to the front, I noticed a sign for 2 specials that sounded good, so I asked her about them as we were placing our order.  Stacy opted for the Fruiti deMare without the marinara sauce.  She wanted just more a light, garlic topping.  She deleted some items from her dinner salad that she does not like.  I order the same special as is, but requested 1 item left off my salad.  I made my way outside now to get Stacy sweatshirt, and I used the RR.  We waited some more, and eventually got our drinks.  The salads were delivered and the 3 items that Stacy did not want, she got.  My salad was incorrect also.  The lady was very nice and noticed.  She took them back and fixed them.  

After I had a sip of my cabernet, I noticed that it was very vinegar/sour tasting which usually means an old, opened bottle.  We ate our entire salad, but never saw our server again.  I left the wine sitting and went to get some water with the plastic cup that was placed on our table.  Stacy taste my wine.  Her face crinkled up with a terrible face.  

Our food took a long time.  Other people were going in and out.  Take out pizza was the big item.  The 2 ladies serving the tables were not happy, and they were not able to keep up.  Especially the one that was not waiting on us.  She just keep rolling her eyes every time that she came out from behind the counter.  Not a happy girl.  

Eventually, the unhappy one was the one that delivered our food.  Immediately at looking at Stacy's food, I said, \"that looks good\".  Mine . . . not so much.  I have never seen so much marinara sauce in my life.  It was like I got a bowl of marinara with a few noodles & my seafood (mussels, clams, shrimp, etc) were completely buried in sauce.  I told the unhappy server \"could you tell her that my wine is very soured, and I will try a glass of the chianti, and Stacy would like a glass too. She said \"ok\".  She brought our chianti.  We both left it sitting on the table also.  It was very soured too.  I noticed that no one else was drinking wine.  Maybe that is why.

 I helped to get all the shells off of Stacy's dish (as she is disabled).  When done, I began my mission of scooping tablespoon after tablespoon of marinara off of my dish.  Again, I have never seen this much marinara on a dish.  I probably should have said something, and looking back on it, I would have because I basically had a dish that I could not eat.  I tried to eat some of the seafood.  

Stacy & I finished.  No server.  We waited and waited some more.  It was like we were not even there.  Our original server never came by.  Of course, either did the grouchy one.  Again, I got up.  Waited in the take out line to talk to our original server.  I said that I would like 2 boxes & our ticket.  She said, \"OK.  How was your pasta?\"  I said that Stacy's was great.  Mine was a bowl of marinara, so I couldn't eat much\".  She did not respond.   She eventually brought our ticket and the boxes, and once again said nothing.  I boxed up our food.  I figured with mine that I could go home, cook a box of pasta to add to the marinara sauce.  Stacy's would be fine.  

I would have loved some more bread, service, better drinks, maybe even a smile.  Terrible terrible terrible.  I will not go back.  In fact, I always tip 20%.  I can name on one hand how many times I have tipped 15%.  Last night was a 15 %.  It should have been zero, but I would never do that to a server.  I seriously do not know how this place stays in business, because I have not had such bad/ non service in a long, long time.  

NEVER AGAIN!  

I will stick with Vito's or Sourdough in Mesa. Rigatony's or Nello's.  Terrible service, food, wine, experience!!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. Best pizza, garlic knots, and service in town. We go here about once per month. The whole experience feels like we went back east through a time warp. Keep up the good work, Sal."}
{"text":"Me and family stop by Sal's in Gilbert Arizona for lunch and all I got to tell you is 5 stars and it is the bomb which means very very good bone appetito"}
{"text":"4 stars alone on the garlic knots! These are by far the best tasting ones I've ever had. We also had a pepperoni calzone that was ok. It had way too much cheese and I wish it had more pepperoni and and some marinera inside it. Guess I should have asked before hand. The Caesar salad we had was also good. But to be honest in the future I will probably just stick to a salad and some garlic knots."}
{"text":"I've lived in NY for 30+ years this is damn near perfect replica to a great NY pizzeria!!"}
{"text":"If you want good pizza there's many places you can go. If you want great pizza go to Sal's. The calzons are also great. Go early as it gets busy.  Been there several times and will be there again."}
{"text":"Sal's is my favorite pizza place and it is locally owned making it even better! Great food and very friendly staff. Definitely recommend the Desert Heat pizza"}
{"text":"Hmmm..., 
Decided to visit this establishment after reading the reviews on Yelp and other sites.  I was a little confused as to whether I would be seated by staff or just seat myself.  Then, I saw the \"order at counter\" sign so I got in line.  I placed my order and the lady asked if I wanted my food to go or dine-in.  I decided on dining in which is where the whole experience really went down from there.  The server brought out my pizza but not the garlic knots-meh, not so bad maybe she's busy and just forgot even though the joints next to empty.  So I get all my chow and after that no one comes back to check on me... no one.  Then as I'm leaving one of the male servers gives me a look of contempt as I pass him and audibly groans at my passing.  I refill my soda and leave.  

I'm giving two stars for the lady that took my order at the counter.  She at least seemed concerned with providing some service.  The food was okay if a bit overpriced for what I was getting. The joint appeared to be clean though.

I doubt I will visit this establishment again.  Overall the service and food doesn't justfy the $30 for one person that I spent.  

Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Garlic knots are kind of a silly thing to geek out over, but Sal's garlic knots are SO good...buttery-garlicky-cheesy deliciousness, I almost want to eat just garlic knots every time I come here!  This Jersey girl gives Sal's two thumbs up for the food, the prices AND of course, the garlic knots.  The pizza is very good...my 2nd or 3rd favorite in the valley... but the pasta gets even higher marks from me.  I'm picky about Chicken Marsala, but I tried Sal's last night and it was the best I've ever had.  Restaurant is clean, friendly and bright.  Come try it out!"}
{"text":"Came across this by accident when leaving a downtown Gilbert event. I'm Italian, 2 years removed from living most of my life in Jersey and having tried several dozen AZ pizzerias, I have finally found an AUTHENTIC Italian spot.  This is Jersey/NY pizza....finally.  And its not the obligatory \"New York style\" line these idiots advertise.  When I asked the very friendly and patient waitress where the owner was from, she told me he was from Italy and lived in NYC prior to relocating to AZ.  

Pizza was perfect.  For all the midwesterners out here who are accustomed to pizza from chain restaurants, Ranch covering everything and that neon yellow French's crap on your Oscar Meyer hot dogs, this may not be for you.  Cannoli was also delicious; flaky shell and actual ricotta filling.  Perfection.

Lots of macaroni on the menu we're looking forward to trying dish by dish.  Took me 2 years to find and if you're a Tri-state transplant, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in to place a to go order last night. This was a third visit. I could not wait to bring home to my guests the delicious was lasagna  pizza extra-large. We've gotten it before and it was wonderful. But last night must've been an off day. After waiting 20 minutes which was a reasonable amount of time. Somehow the pizza was cold. And half the normal toppings. So disappointing. I know they do good pizza so I will give it another try. But the worst part was the lady at the front who took our order. She could not be pleasant or smile if she was paid. I'm assuming she was an intern.
Sal's offered us a chance to come back and give them another try and the pizza was fantastic everything we've had in the past and then some."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Thin crust was tender but had a nice crispiness to it. We got a Desert Heat (sausage, jalapeños, green chiles & double cheese). They can make it anywhere from mild to very spicy by dialing up the jalapeños. Medium was a flavorful heat without being too spicy, at least for our taste. Chicken parmigiana was also very tasty. And, yeah, garlic knots are free but would be worth paying for even if they weren't."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and customer service. Will be a regular at this place!
Menu is full of choices and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Delicious! A little pricey and super busy but worth it! We had the baked ziti pizza and it was amazing! I have also had the Sicilian which is yummy too!"}
{"text":"The Bruschetta tasted so fresh and had a ton of flavor. The garlic knots are soft and warm. Our server Steven was super funny and provided a great experience. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"One night we were eating at a nearby restaurant and noticed the filled parking lot at Sals.  Soon after that, it was featured on a food network TV show for \"best pizza\" in the East Valley.  So we had to try it.  We called for \"take out\" and were told it would be ready in about 30 minutes (not the usual 10-15 minutes like most places.)  So we knew it must be something special.  Sure enough - 5 star.  Since that first time in early 2017, the restaurant has more than doubled its size, including the kitchen.  Last Friday, I called in about 4:15 - still 35-40 minute wait.  But so worth waiting for.  Thanks Sal!"}
{"text":"Saw this joint on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives(love the show), so I took the family to eat there. The food was pretty good, got the lasagna pizza, and would definitely go back to get it. I agree with some that the service was not so great. My wife had to ask for refills on her drinks, which drives me crazy, and we had to wait a good amount of time for our check. 

Overall, pretty solid. Subpar service, really good pizza."}
{"text":"I love Sal's!!  Sal and Grace (the owners) are very kind and welcoming.  The food is fantastic.  The garlic knots are TO DIE FOR.  They are soooo good.  They are just a little high priced, but that's okay.  The food, for the most part, is worth it.  Definitely worth a shot if you have never been!!"}
{"text":"I'm born and raised in Queens, NYC. This is the most authentic pizza and Italian food since I've been here (10yrs). Excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesome owner, great food, excellent variety, good for kids... best neighborhood pizza in Gilbert! The price point ain't bad either."}
{"text":"Some of the pest pizza that I have had! The flavored are amazing...plus the different choices for ingredients is great...it's fun to try different things! Also their customer service is extraordinary..they make sure you have everything you need and that you enjoyed your food...even the owner himself comes out to greet you, which is nice to see now a days! I definitely recommend this place and they will always have a customer as long as they are open!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers, food, atmosphere and excellent service! Although, the wait is long, and their Draft is limited. Plus the sicilian pizza came out lukewarm :(.

Overall, great eatery!

But we're definitely giving it another try!"}
{"text":"Came in with a friend for a small bite and a beer.
The garlic knots were given for a starter while we wait, and I felt like hogging them all! I could've done just fine with just the garlic knots and a beer! I got the honey wings (6) and my friend got a slice. Looks like the slice could've used more topping but it looked delicious. My wings were on the small side - one drum looked pigeon size. However the skin was crispy and the sauce was good. If the wings were normal size this would be a 5 star review. For $6.50 for the SIX wings here I would've rather had Casey Moore's wings on happy hour for the same price and get a DOZEN, at least I know I'm getting good size, texture and taste. I spied a pizza on a neighboring table and it looked scrumptious. I'll definitely be back, but PLEASE, MANAGER, get some decently sized wings! I feel sorry for the chickens that were culled as adolescents.
Now the beers -- don't expect anything fancy. Sure they have Stella, Blue Moon and Peroni, but the rest are yellow beers except for Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Michelob bock. Way to play it safe, Sal, but the bock was as good as expected since I've had it before.
I wish this could be a better review, but those 6 dinker wings for $6.50 really got my goat. The redeeming factor was the garlic knots."}
{"text":"This place is great. I've been here numerous times and the food has been great every time. The customer service has been even better. I have two infants and one time my 16 month old was fussy, so the waiter brought him out some dough to play with and calm down. I know it doesn't sound like a biggie, but little things like that go a long way in my book!"}
{"text":"Still love the place but the last few times the pizza was not up to their norm. Perhaps they are getting to far afield with the salad pizza, lasagne pizza etc."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Not only is the pizza absolutely fantastic, a great bargain for what you get and everything else on the menu absolutely delicious...the service is perfect, too! I love that whenever you go in, the owner and his family are always on duty. They always go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and happy, even though I have never been in and not seen the place crazy busy! They make awesome food and provide awesome service- what more can you ask for!!!!"}
{"text":"Baked Ziti pizza is the BEST!!!

Food is always great, owner is great, wait staff can be iffy.

Don't let the strip mall exterior scare you off.   :)"}
{"text":"Review would have been higher, had the service been better...
The Rattlesnake pizza was tasty--lots of jalapenos though, so it has some kick!
The service sucked--nobody seemed to care that we were sitting there. No plates, no silverware, nobody checked in on us, took forever to get the check. Different people dropped things off, took the check, brought cups, etc."}
{"text":"Came in last night for dinner at about 730pm.   Had a few people in front of us and the wait was about 10 minutes but they seemed to have lots of open seats.  Perhaps under staffed?  After our wait, we sat down and ordered a white pizza with chicken right away.  The waitress who was very pleasant brought us some garlic knots that had obviously been microwaved due to the elastic consistency (not good) . It took 45 minutes to get our pizza from the time we ordered.  Once our pizza came we had to get it boxed because keeping a 2yr old still in a seat for an hour is tough.  If I walk into a pizza place that is not filled to capacity I would assume that I can get my pie within 15-20 max.  not 45!

Now the food.....   As I will try to attach pictures  This pizza was not worth the money.  The white pizza itself was 19.99  Plus 6.50 for the chicken.  This is ROBBERY in Gilbert!  Almost 30 bucks for a pizza that had a burned bottom and doughy crust on top.  Along the obviously spoon flung ricotta cheese clumps on the top.  I could understand a few bucks for chicken.  This chicken seemed to be fried and just cut up, it wasn't even grilled.  The pieces were small and mostly breading.  Not too impressed I'm afraid.  To have the prices set at 19.99 for just a white pizza (a cheese pizza) no toppings besides ricotta.  The quality better be top notch.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  TV show or not, they have a sever food and speed problem.  The staff was very nice, the waitress very apologetic when asked about the price. She simple said she lowered the price of the chicken from the normal $9.50  to $6.50 because it was too much, but that's all she was able to do.  I understood her position as it was not her fault, but this owner should seriously reconsider his/her pricing and food quality."}
{"text":"We had seen a ton of reviews on this place! My brother from Buffalo, NY even called me to tell me to go there because he had seen it on a food tv show.
When I informed him that we had gone there already, and it wasn't all that great, he was disappointed.
I love pizza and wings! Wings are a touch subject for me and my husband since we are from buffalo... Well theirs were just average. nothing special, kind of small. 
We got a pizza, wings and garlic knots. Out of these three things, nothing grabbed my attention enough to make me what to go back. It was quick getting our food, and the service was nice, but the food wasn't fantastic unfortunately."}
{"text":"amazing pizza. the ziti pizza was a weird idea to me, but it's something I crave often now. 

the sauces are excellent. I came in just to fill a Mason jar with vodka sauce. 

eggplant parm is amazing. the portion is so big that I got three meals out of it. 

the gnocchi is great and the garlic knots are the best.

the service is great. everyone is so nice."}
{"text":"It was delicious but my belly didn't like me afterwards!
The ziti pizza was to die for , the chicken pesto was pretty greasy but good going down lol! Pricey compared to other pizza joints"}
{"text":"I am a pizza junkie who favors no style but only what I desire. 
 Crisp crust....check. Was crust tasty. ..Yes.
 Quality of toppings. ...ummmm yummy. ...Yes.
  Beyond that I can't remember much. Only that yes I believe in the hype. Damn good pizza. 
 The dedication and craftsmanship shows in each pizza pie and in the side dishes. Loved the Greek Salad. Will I return. ..Yes. Do I recommend this place.
 Yup."}
{"text":"Genuinely enjoy the pizza here. Tends to be quite busy. The baked ziti pizza is awesome. White pizza delicious.  Definitely a ny style chewy crust if you are on the mood."}
{"text":"You will not get better Italian food anywhere it's authentic family owned and great prices love this place it's our Friday night date night location"}
{"text":"Love this Gilbert gem! My parents recently moved close by and this has been our go to spot for pizza nights. The do pizza by the slice (mostly around lunch) AND if you dine in, they give you complimentary garlic knots! Our favorites are the chicken pesto pizza and the baked ziti pizza. One or two slices & you're stuffed! The service was friendly and the place is always hopping. You can tell its family owned. Order on Wednesdays- they usually have a good deal!"}
{"text":"I went out for lunch with family and we couldn't decide where to eat.  I just started driving toward Gilbert and I said if we see something good we're going there.  I pulled up to Sal's, walked in and remembered seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  We ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza, garlic knots and hot wings.

This has to be one of the best pizzas I've ever had!  The crust was light and crispy from edge to center.  The sauce is very flavorful; you can taste the fresh tomatoes, garlic and basil in every bite. The knots were good, garlicky and fresh. We asked  to have our wings cooked extra crispy.  They were crunchy on the outside but still very juicy and the sauce had a great kick.  Hold on, I just got my cheesecake... creamy and delicious.  Wow.

Bottom line: I love local, family-owned pizzerias and this is the best I've been to so far.  I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Moved from New Jersey to Arizona a few months ago, and have to say, feels like eating great pizza back east.  Sal's had been recommended to us by relatives that live in Arizona, and being Italian, for sure, they were absolutely right.  Have not had their meals as of yet, but sure looking forward to that in the near future.  Had their meatballs, and they taste exactly like my Mom's and my own, not to mention the sauce that is a duplicate to my family's.  Feels like \"Home Away From Home.\"  So glad we have this great restaurant, thought we would not find any matches to those back home in Jersey."}
{"text":"This place made me remove all other 'pizza joints' from my Bookmarks, there's no need to go anywhere else! Firstly, you get a warm Italian family feel from the second you walk in. Secondly, it was featured on Diner's Drive In's and Dives, so it's already a hotspot, and third, the food is delicious. Prices are very fair. I ordered the spaghetti alfredo with caesar salad and a slice of the famous ziti pizza. I had plenty of leftovers. Each component of the meal was awesome. Thanks Sal's!"}
{"text":"The pizza was both huge and delicious. We had the 16\" meatball and green olive regular pizza. We couldn't even begin to finish it all. The cheese was really good mozzarella and obviously neither frozen nor cut with non-cheese filler. 

We had great service so I don't get the other bad reviews. Here is a tip - if you pay for the food before eating include a tip if you actually want a person making $3.00/hour to give you service (waitstaff wages in AZ). Just a bit of advice for those who had \"bad service\"."}
{"text":"Nice to see they are expanding!! Sometimes the service is a little lackluster, but the pizza is SOOO good, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Was supposed to be some of the best pizza around. Was sadly disappointed. I thought I would find my gold mine in the desert for pizza. Still on the hunt for great pizza."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Gilbert. Their speciality pizzas are awesome. We really like the lasagna pizza.  It's a dense pizza so a small goes along way."}
{"text":"Alright. The food is very good. I have to give this about an even heat with Grimaldis' Buono's and Casanova Bros with regard to food quality. The defining quality of any of these restaurants however, is S E R V I C E!

The first few times we came here the service was O K A Y. The last two times we went here the service S U C K E D OUT LOUD! 

Here's my advice to the owner of this establishment: 

TRAIN YOUR WAIT STAFF TO GREET YOUR DAMN CUSTOMERS WHEN THEY WALK IN YOUR DAMN DOOR! TRAIN YOUR STAFF TO HIT THE TABLE WITH DRINK GLASSES WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF THE CUSTOMERS SITTING DOWN...PERIOD!

My wife and I sat there for five minutes waiting for someone... ANYONE to make eye contact with us or acknowledge that we were even there. Everybody was just too busy to even look at us. We knew that THEY knew we were there because they made it obvious that they didn't want to make eye contact because that would have meant slowing down long enough to talk to us! 

Finally, the waitress walked over to the couple in front of us that had just walked in and seated themselves not a minute before and gave them a plate of garlic knots and glasses. My wife and I were still sitting there with our mouths gaping open and that was when YOU LOST MY BUSINESS! We both got up and walked out and nobody even bothered to ask us why. 

My wife and I have been coming here for months since finding the place. We spend thirty bucks every other week with you folks. That's $780.00 bucks per year you are going to miss out on because of your lousy service. 

If you wanna find us we'll be at Casanova Bros. or Grimaldis. They are the only pizza establishments left in the East Valley that truly understand customer service!"}
{"text":"Super busy and difficult parking, but this place is 100% worth it! My husband and I drove from the Mesa/Tempe area to try this place out. A lot of pizza places make me sick (for whatever reason), but this place gave me no problems! I can't wait to go back and try some other creative pizzas on their menu."}
{"text":"We got the family deal last night (pizza, wings, garlic knots). It was plenty of food for a family of 4 and everything was very good.  Sal was holding court as usual and there were lots of hard working, friendly young people bustling around. Food was hot and ready for pick up as promised. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place will win you over on smell alone. The white pizza was amazing and they have some great specials. My Gal Pals like the pasta special on Tuesdays, they end up with dinner from the left overs. I honestly cant wait to try everything on the menu! The staff has been really great each time too. One last thing...GARLIC KNOTS. =)"}
{"text":"Chicken Marsala pizza is a must! It was full of flavor and light. Their pizza is probably the best I've ever had, the crust was crisp even days after. The pizza wasn't heavy or oily. The staff was friendly, I think it's family owned and maybe that's the big difference from other pizza places."}
{"text":"Enjoyed another great take out pizza and salad from Sal's. Always good service and always good pizza, but they can be very busy and this time they left the meat off our anti pasta salad . Next time we will check on pickup"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza. The garlic knots are out of this world. You can't go wrong at this fantastic pizzeria."}
{"text":"I love their pizza and clearly some reviewers don't like thin crust so why eat at a New York style pizza place is beyond me but we love it! I usually stop in for their lunch special because two slices and a soda for $6 is a great deal and I'm never let down, sometimes I even spring for a specialty if they have one I like. I have a very picky 3yr old cheese pizza eater and this is always a place I know he will eat the pizza from which is a huge plus! 

The cheesecake is delicious also as well as the cannoli!"}
{"text":"This place has a couple of things that are good, for example, their salad, their knots.   For the most part this place is lazy and uninspired.  The chef in the back has been working there way too long, but still doesn't have basics down, like that you send everyones food out together.  
The pizza sauce and the sauce they serve with their garlic knots sucks.  From a can, no flavor whatsoever besides the vinegar-y canned tomato taste.  All of the seafood is frozen, as well as the ravioli, zucchini, mozzarella sticks.  Although the menu states that the cannoli cream is homemade, that is straight bullshit.
The pizza that is served for slices is made  in the morning, and sits out, all day, uncooled or heated, until the end of the night.  They change the time tags out during the day so that they aren't busted by the health department, which states that food is only supposed to be out for two hours before being tossed.  So if you've ever gotten a stomach ache after eating here, that might be it."}
{"text":"I had not been to Sal's in a few month; went back last night with a few friends and WOW was it good!  We started with a caprese salad which was quite nice with fresh mozzarella.  Next we had fried calamari which nice an d crunchy on the outside an d not over cooked on the inside.  Out came two pizzas...one sausage and one meatball and boy were they yummy.  I'm originally from the Bronx and these two pizzas were awfully close to the real thing.  My only issue I think, is they put too much cheese on it.    But really it's hard to complain about too much of anything!  Lastly, we ended with cannollis, the shells were perfectly crunching an d the filling just sweet enough.  I must mention too that the wait staff was great....we came in very late and they did not at all try to rush us out and I'm sure they had a long day there."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and I would give it 5 stars based on food alone!!

BUT just drove over an hour and it's closed!! Maybe you should update your website and Yelp with correct hours so visitors know your closed on Mondays!!"}
{"text":"It was on Diners Drive Ins and Dives so being the TV Foodies we are my wife and I had to try it. We had Pizza and WIngs. Duh! 
It was awesome! No wonder it was on Triple D. My advice if going on a Friday... Get there early. They fill up quick"}
{"text":"Great service. Good food.  Ordered side salads and a pizza. Garlic knots came standard.   The salads were EXCELLENT! pretty sure the dressing is house made.  Nice thin crust pizza.  The sauce could use a bit more seasoning,  otherwise, again,  excellent! Cold beer. Patio seating. Only downsize is they are playing Christmas music already. Lol. I guess it's technically after thanksgiving though.  Would still recommend!"}
{"text":"Been going to Gilbert pizza ever since they opened. We always have a good experience and great food. They certainly are a lot more popular today than they used to be but they deserve every bit of it.  If you see a Stromboli in the counter make sure to get one particularly their sausage onion and peppers.  It is one of the best things I've had Italian wise the side of the Mississippi."}
{"text":"Their Alfredo sauce is AMAZING!!! They pair well with Grubhub with great food and great delivery!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, my family's go-to for pizza. The best garlic knots ever!! I would highly recommend trying this place if you haven't already :)"}
{"text":"Love Sal's! Grace and Sal are amazing people! They are always friendly, restaurant is clean, and neat! Atmosphere is fun and inviting! Food is second to none!"}
{"text":"Sal's Gilbert Pizza. Wow what a place. 
Some places do not deserve reviews but this local family owned pizza joint certainly does. 

I have been to this restaurant several times and have waited to write this long overdue review. 

Picture this.....  you walk in and everyone seems robotic and it feels like a total chain restaurant. You think to yourself the quality must be poor. Everything will be bland and with so many locations no way this restaurant will suffice my hungry and eager palate. Got it? Ok...... now know that this restaurant is far from that. 

Sal's Gilbert pizza is a family owned restaurant and they certainly strive to succeed and deliver at every bite. The staff is friendly. The service is on point and I certainly do not have any complaints. 

The pizza is delicious and the quality is recognizable because it certainly tastes like it was made with love. 

The Calzone's. Wow the Calzone's. More like giant loaves of bread stuffed to the brim with all your favorites. I have never and I repeat never been to a place where the calzone was this stuffed and full. Believe me this is a good thing. I had to take half of it home. I'm sure we all know the places where you order a calzone and you get a pita pocket filled with air and hardly any filling. Definitely not the case here. 

Keep it up Sal's Gilbert pizza. You get my 5 stars."}
{"text":"Loved it!  From the garlic knots and pizza to,the dessert, this place did not disappoint.  Service was great too.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. We make it our first place to visit every time we come down on holidays. 

Everyone is so friendly and the service has always been great. Sometimes you'll even get to talk to Sal himself. He's such a great dude. 

They will bring you out free garlic knots -- these are absolutely delicious. 

We have always had pizza here, so not sure on the rest of the menu, but their pizza has always been the comparison to other pizzas we will have. \"This isn't as good as Sal's\" is usually what we will end up saying. 

Sal's is the best pizza we have ever had. End of story."}
{"text":"Sicilian style pepperoni with cheese. Thick crust,
More like a pan pizza. Pizza was delicious and delivery was quick. I will try the thin crust next time. Pizza could have been hotter is my only 
Complaint."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat when I am in Phoenix. Good food, super nice owners. We always get garlic knots and grandma's pizza. Both delicious. Have tried many dishes and never disappointed. Very busy on weekends so reservations are recommended. The can also accommodate larger groups."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza I've had since moving away from Eastern Pennsylvania over 20 years ago.  Having grown up around actual New York/New Jersey pizza, I'm extremely picky. 
It is a cozy, family-friendly establishment, with both take-out and sit-down dining.  Their extensive menu of authentic Italian food has something for everyone.  The place is always packed on the weekends, so plan at least forty minutes ahead of time if you're ordering take-out.  Trust me, IT'S WORTH IT!!!!"}
{"text":"This place gets crazy busy after 430.  I guess that's what happens when you offer great food!   There is a coupon for two pizzas and garlic knots for a great low price.  We absolutely love this place and they are expanding.  Yeah.  Go Sals !"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night because we like to try all of the places Guy has visited locally. 

The garlic knots were delicious. I ordered a 14\" Spaghetti and Meatball pizza. It was good but I counted and it had a total of 9 dime to nickel sized meatballs on it...I guess I expected bigger balls or more of them! The sauce also reminded me of the sauce in a can of Spaghettis. It didn't taste like the sauce that came with the garlic knots so they must use different sauces for each item. 

I was hoping to have my mind blown by this pizza...I was let down a little bit BUT again, it was good enough for me to eat 2 slices! 

My husband had the Stromboli and said it was good. 

Service was acceptable and the patio atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"EXCEPTIONAL PIZZA, INCREDIBLE SERVICE. 

I ordered pizza on a Sunday night, and I could tell over the phone that this restaurant was a madhouse filled with customers. Regardless, the woman on the phone (I'm guessing it may have been the co-owner?) was extremely polite and patient with me to help figure out a specialty pizza slice that I had ordered on another day. Though she was undoubtedly busy, she asked me to let her see if the kitchen had the ingredients to make this off-menu item!!! I was floored. THAT is awesome service.

My husband went and picked up the pizza, confirmed the pizzeria was a zoo (because obviously everybody wants to eat there), and that the woman behind the counter thanked him for \"smiling patiently.\" THEN, someone (my husband claims it was Sal) came out from the kitchen with my specialty pizza and proudly stated, \"I made this.\" It had to be Sal, right? He even stabilized the pizza a special way so that the toppings would not fall around during the car ride home. The pizza was a masterpiece. Almost too beautiful to eat, had I not been pregnant and starving. I wish I had taken a pic of the it, but we wolfed the entire thing before the hunger trance cleared. 

A huge thanks to Sal's family! You set the standard for quality service and cuisine in this town, and you have customers for life."}
{"text":"The best pizza. Grandma's pizza is the best.  Perfect as usual.  Place was even more packed than usual on a Friday night.  Sal's Gilbert Pizza was featured on the Food Network Diners, Drive ins, and Dives and everyone was here eating and watching it.  So awesome for Gilbert Pizza."}
{"text":"Saw this place on DDD and luckily we live 5 minutes away... EXCELLENT! As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a young man named Wyatt who ended up being our server.. he explained all the \"slices\" and what they all consisted of.. we sat at our table to be promptly greeted by sweet Wyatt again, only now he had garlic knots for us...they were awesome. We ordered the chicken Marsala pizza and were VERY pleased... the crust is thin so you can really get a nice taste of the toppings.. another bonus is that the bottom crust NEVER gets soggy with all the Marsala sauce.. perfect. We will definitely be back. Met Sal on the way out and made sure he knew what a great server Wyatt was for us."}
{"text":"Gilbert Pizza has been around for a few years, but I've never eaten there before. Now I know why.

The pizza is some of the worst I ever had, all in part to the awful crust. Jean G. described it to a T. The crust is mind-bogglingly bland. It actually takes flavor away from the toppings. In our case, we got a margherita which had decent mozzarella and fresh (not baked until crisp) basil. I probably should have known something was up with this place when I saw the margherita advertised as \"new\" on the menu.  The crust is way too thick to be considered a thin crust pie. Thank god there was peppers, parmesean, and garlic powder on the table. Like a shitty supermarket frozen pizza, this baby needed to be doctored up!

Garlic knots were the only saving grace. Appropriately greasy with plently of garlic and served very warm.

Service was ok. Our order was taken quickly, and the food came out right away. They never came back to check on us, but I'm sort of glad they didn't so that I wouldn't have to lie when they asked how I liked the food. I found it kind of weird that their self-serve soda machine doesn't have a water spout. Instead, the waitress has to go behind the bar to fill up glasses.

No big deal, though. It's not like we'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Excellent lasagna pizza. Unique, great flavor, perfect amount of ricotta (quite a bit), good meat sauce, crispy crust. We always get it, and it's consistently good. The garlic knots are good, but have a very strong garlic flavor- a bit too much for me, but it's definitely fresh garlic, not garlic powder. Overall, a great place. Clean inside, and good, polite service."}
{"text":"I get wings here a couple times a month because they are amazing.  Their pizza is also great, especially the interesting custom designs like \"lasagna pizza\".  This place can get really busy after 5pm, especially on the weekends, so plan ahead.  Totally worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Sal your restaurant is even more amazing. The bigger your building the more business. That's because the food is incredibly delicious, and the staff is great. There is a wait and it's worth every minute. Thanks for offering such wonderful food."}
{"text":"Great pizza, comfortable atmosphere, and friendly service! I stopped in during my first visit to the Phoenix area and this is the place I am craving to go back too!"}
{"text":"Great pizza friendly not to pricey I would go there again clean place to go to the ranch was good and the Buffalo sauce was great. And a good variety of pizza for the lunch special."}
{"text":"I appreciate when a place has good Italian food at a decent price. We love coming here. We try to catch it when it's less busy. The lunch specials are great. Even my picky kiddos will tear into the garlic knots and pizza here. Check it out!!
P.S. they do serve Pepsi products. I like to know whether an establishment serves Coke or Pepsi. I prefer Coke, but they're forgiven. The food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"The pizza just how i like it  new york style pizza with thin crust so yummyy. I tried the cheese pizza and it was great!"}
{"text":"Sal's food is si good, we ate there two days in a row!!!  The Caesar Salad is the best I've ever had (no sparing of Shaved Parmesan cheese), their pizza is so fresh; we had several slices of several!  Today we ordered Chicken& Eggplant Parmigiana, which was huge portion (full).  The eggplant was crunchy; the chicken was tender!  The sauce is Devine Italiano...mangia mangia. Can't wait to visit the grandkids again soon to return-visit"}
{"text":"I am from New York, where Pizza is amazing. If I had to live off one food the rest of my life, it would be New York Pizza.  Sals Pizza is good but it is not New York Pizza.  I've been told it is. It is not. It lacks the super intense flavor of an amazing sauce, greasy toppings and whole milk cheeses. 

I've tried four of their pizzas. They are pricey.  They are good.  The pepperoni is very good but I don't yearn for it when I don't have it for a while.

The restaurant is lovely, clean and well run.  The help are well trained and friendly.  The portions of the non pizza dishes are generous.  There is ample parking.

It does not taste like Little Caesar's, Peter Piper Pizza or Dominos.  I would recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"I am from NY and I love good food especially Italian food. This place has great food and Sal himself can be found working hard to make use all very full and happy!  My favorite is the Sausage and Pepper Stromboli, the best in the valley!  On the weekends this place is packed but it usually goes pretty quick."}
{"text":"Good: service always checked to make sure everything was alright

Bad: greasy pizza
Took a moment for service to get our order"}
{"text":"Chicken Marsala pizza.
Chicken Marsala pizza?
Chicken Marsala mother trucking pizza!
Genius.
So smart.
The pesto is great too, crust is just right always crispy never burnt. 
Get the chicken Marsala pizza I'm not joking."}
{"text":"The food here was very exquisite and delicious. I would recommend this place to anybody, and will certainly be back in the near future. Also the food was affordable and worth the money."}
{"text":"Growing up in New York, and having miserable pizza and wings in Arizona for years, I've been blown away since I found Sal's Gilbert Pizza. Their pizza is ridiculously amazing.  The baked ziti pizza is to die for! But their wing sauce is out of this world... Growing up in Buffalo I know a thing or two about wings, Their sauce is so unique but still very Buffalo, I honestly could live on these... My now favorite place for pizza & wings in AZ or Buffalo for that matter..."}
{"text":"I grew up in New York City so you could say I am a bit of a pizza snob.  Well Sals finally opened up here in Gilbert and my friends were skeptical being devoted to their Pizza Hut and papa johns.  Sals has exploded.  I couldn't be happier for this hard working family. Excellent entree too.  Love their Sicilian pizza, chicken park dinner and calzones too.  Generous portions. Great salads and yummy complimentary. garlic knots   Cannolis are great too if you want dessert."}
{"text":"BEST ITALIAN IN AZ.
I myself am Italian, and I definitely would recommend going to this restaurant. 
I recommend baked ziti pizza, garlic knots, meatball sub, chicken parmigiano,  everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Gilbert Pizza is consistently amazing.  The sauce and crust are perfect!  The Baked Ziti Pizza is a favorite of my kids and mine.  The sauce is creamy and delicious.  Ziti is perfectly baked and draped in the perfect amount of gooey mozzarella.  The crust is light and crispy.  It's the most perfect crust I have ever had.  Another of our favorites here is the calamari.  We order calamari everywhere and it is never as good as it is here!  It has small tender pieces that are perfectly breaded.  It is served with lemon slices and the best marinara around.  The service is always amazing.  This is a family owned establishment and you can feel the love in the service and food.  We had such a nice attentive server today.  He checked in on us often and anticipated our departure perfectly.  He was very nice, welcomed us as we arrived and thanked us for coming as we left.  This place has been wonderful since the day it opened!  If you're in Gilbert stop in for a slice, you won't have any regrets!"}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in the south east Valley bar none!!!!!! 

Pastas are amazing..... Chicken parm is huge and my wife just got the muscles dinner with white wine sauce and loved it!!!! 

Oh and if you come for dinner free garlic knots!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's been at least a couple of years since we've last have eaten food from Sal's. This changes NOW!! I ordered through Door Dash the other day- I was SO pleasantly surprised with the portions. I also forgot their entrees come with salads AND garlic knots!!! I also really LOVED how the people at Sal's packaged my food- it was placed in a cardboard box. My two entrees clearly visible, salads, garlic knots, and dressing. As the delivery guy was approaching my door I could clearly see all the items I ordered. My linguini marinara and meatballs and linguini Alfredo with broccoli were delicious. Enough to feed my three year son and I one night, and lunch for my husband and I the next. We are DEFINITELY adding Sal's back to our takeout options."}
{"text":"Amazing! Cocktails and pizza is always a winning combination. Well, anything with cocktails is amazing. But seriously, the pizza is beyond delicious. Nothing could possibly make this place better.

One of the best pizzas I've ever had. We ordered the thin-crust pepperoni pizza. The cheese is the best part. A lot of times, I feel like pizza cheese gets rubbery, but this cheese was so fresh and gooey. Absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives Guy Fieri got me in, but the great food and friendly service keeps me coming back for more. A friend mentioned that Sal's from Gilbert was on Triple D and living in Gilbert myself that's all it took to get me to try it....the power of television and off we went! Since then I've been back at least 6 more times. 
My favorite is the desert heat pizza, a spicy combination of green chili's, jalapenos, fresh sausage and a mound of extra cheese! (also sold by the slice) We've had the baked ziti, another dish they don't hold back on the cheesy goodness, a scrumptious sausage calzone(big enough to share), House and Caesar side salads, honey hot wings(a flavor combo made by request of my mini me) She begged me to go there last night, she loves their wings and did I mention the melt in your mouth garlic knots I have to fight her for? They give you a complimentary plate of about 6 and I was lucky enough to get 2 of them before she had the rest ate.
The staff is extremely friendly, but what impressed me the most was that every time we've been there so has Sal the owner. He doesn't sit on the sidelines, he works as hard as everyone else and makes it a point to greet his customers. His staff speaks very highly of him and that to me says a lot. He stopped what he was doing last night and came over to talk to me and my daughter whom was thrilled to meet him. This is a man who loves his business and his customers.
 We'll definitely be back for more, Triple D tested and Mama approved!"}
{"text":"If you like generic pizza chain pizza, this is not for you. And if you think the \"burnt\" bottom of the crust is a bad thing, generic pizza places are definitely for you. This pizza is the closest to New York style I have found in Arizona. The crust is Italian and the size and toppings are American. In short, this crust will save you a trip to Italy. We got the lasagna and chicken Marsala pizzas, both of which were delicious. We also got two orders of garlic knots that did not last long. The only thing that was not as expected was the cannoli: it was good, but not great. We will definitely be back to try other pizzas, pasta, anti pasta, and more garlic knots."}
{"text":"So, this place deserves every star. We were skeptical at first of ordering pizza with Spaghetti and Meatballs on it, so we did a half and half with a Margarita. Both were stupendous. The spaghetti and Meatball has petite meatballs and a hint of vodka sauce that will make you want to use a fork and knife but damn that idea and fold it up because it's worth it. 

They sat delicious garlic knots in front of us at the beginning that were also pretty tasty. Overall, this is a place I'd recommend highly. Just come early and come hungry. We tried last week and were told it was an hour wait. Today, we walked right in and say down instantly. We ordered a large and only are two slices each."}
{"text":"Drove in 180 miles and already had plans to hit Sal's.  Excellent food, will without a doubt visit again when I make the drive again.  We ordered the garlic knots with mozzarella cheese but got garlic toast with mozzarella, no worries because it was still good."}
{"text":"So glad my wife suggested this place from a facebook referral page. The knots were fantastic and the pizza was so delicious. We had a standard pepperoni but also had a build-your-own sausage, pineapple, and sun dried tomato pizza. Wow. You sense family love and pride with every bite. The owners were so kind and gracious to this first-timer. I promised them an honest review. You all nailed it. Thanks for a great supper and leftovers!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been visiting now for years. I don't know why I waited this long to review. Everything we order and every visit has been outstanding!!! The servers remember us and are very friendly. We met sal and he is also amazing and you can tell he has a strong passion for his food quality!! I'm originally from NJ/NY area and this is the best pizza out here in AZ. I will forever be a customer here."}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and this place is awesome! Best customer service and the pizza is unreal! Will definitely be making this my #1 place for pizza from now on!"}
{"text":"The garlic knots were amazing and the service was stellar. However, I was underwhelmed with the taste of the pizza. It was incredibly bland. I had such high hopes for it because I was told it was good. But, I'm not sure that I would go back again. The pizza basically had no taste due to a not too great crust and a bland sauce. I was glad that I used an Entertainment book deal and didn't have to pay full price."}
{"text":"Garlic knots. I dream of their garlic knots. We usually get the pasta with olive oil, garlic, & broccoli. Most times, it is excellent - few times the broccoli is overcooked. Salads are good! They were clearly understaffed for a while and  I once called an order in 45 minutes prior, showed up when they told me to and waited another 30 minutes. Honestly, they're really worth the wait but it'd have been nice had they acknowledged the delay. 

Every time we've dined in, the waiters were really nice and attentive. Despite the things I've pointed out, it's a great local eatery. Prices are good, food is great"}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com. My son and I loved it!! His fave ways the garlic knots, which by the way have tons of garlic, yum!! I got a slice, I don't remember which one. It was square and it was topped with basil and provolone. When I go back, I want to try the ziti slice!"}
{"text":"I said I would go back for the pizza and I did...and I'm glad.  I ordered 2 pizzas to go, both medium, a side salad, and an order of mini cannolis.  I was told it would be ready in 45 minutes and the pizzas were ready when I got there, although it looked like they had to put together the rest of the order after that.  They threw in a complimentary order of garlic knots with marinara sauce with the salad, which I really appreciated.

The \"medium\" pizzas were quite big, as was each slice.  The red pizza had big pieces of fresh broccoli, black olives, and fresh mushrooms.  Very tasty, lots of gooey mozzarella cheese, but it wasn't pure white, so probably not the real \"high end\" stuff.  The crust was good, and I appreciated it wasn't soggy, nor was it when reheated the next day.  The garlic knots were very flavorful and the dipping sauce had a strong tomatoey flavor.  

The white pizza came with mozzarella and ricotta cheese, and was ordered with bacon, spinach, and garlic.  All were delicious, and the garlic was in slices, big enough to see, not like little minced up pieces from most places.  The side salad had plenty of fresh greens, shredded carrots, some red onion pieces and a few black olive slices and cucumbers.  It was flavorful.

Finally, the cannolis were crisp and drizzled with chocolate sauce, with the filling having a slight coconut flavor.

I would definitely rank this pizzeria as one of the best in the area....now if only they delivered!"}
{"text":"Always great pizza, wings, and garlic knots, along with a friendly staff. My favorite pizza place in gilbert"}
{"text":"Good food and great prices.  Pizza was good, wings were cooked perfectly, and the penne ala vodka was one of the best since coming to AZ from NY."}
{"text":"Only a non-New York metropolitan area New Yorker would say this is not authentic New York Style pizza.  I was grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn and later lived on Long Island, I am 100% of Italian decent.... I know NY pizza.... if you don't like it, you are probably someone who call tomato sauce gravy.  This is the real deal!  You may not like it, but that is because you would not know a good pizza if it hit you in the face!!"}
{"text":"Coming from NY ...Their food is the closest I've come in AZ to a real NY pizzaria and their anti pasta and garlic knots are to die for!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I found a thin, crispy, yet chewy slice of pizza outside of NYC.  Family owned and operated local pizza joint in a strip mall makes an excellent garlic knot as well.  It is smothered in cheese and garlic - probably could have eaten these by itself as a meal!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Gilbert for pizza or pasta.  The ingredients are top notch and Sal always churns out a perfect product.  I recommend the desert heat pizza or any pasta with their vodka sauce."}
{"text":"So I told my wife for Father's Day, I could go for some awesome pizza at a 'not-so-commercial' joint (Those are my favorite!). She told me about Gilbert Pizza and I was sold! We went there for lunch with my son and experienced how busy this place is first hand!  The waitress was superhuman! This place was packed and she was the ONLY one working the tables.  As a matter of fact, she was working the register too! It was insane and very entertaining just watching her fly through the restaurant.  She was like the tazmanian devil, except instead of tearing everything apart, when she passes your table, yummy garlic knots and soda cups appear on your table from the funnel cloud!  It was MOST impressive!

We scarfed down the garlic knots (These things are GARLICCY!!!!) made with fresh garlic, and filled our cups with soda.  A lot of people swear by pizza and beer, but I prefer a nice cold Mountain Dew or Dr Pepper when I'm eating pizza. It just reminds me of childhood a little more.  Uh oh! Here comes the funnel cloud again! We shouted our order into the void and within minutes, a 16\" Supreme (New York Style) plopped down on our pizza riser with steam still oozing off the bubbly cheese.  It was uncanny!

If I were to make ONE suggestion (and my excuse for not giving this place a 5 star) is to come up with a way to keep the grease out from under the pizza.  Within about 5 minutes, the pizza was soggy from it. Overall, the taste was excellent!  If you are thinking about going here, DO IT. Only, just order by the slice so it doesn't get soggy."}
{"text":"This place is as close to ny pizza as I've found in the area.. consistently great pizza every time I have it. The kind of pizza you can fold and enjoy."}
{"text":"pizza was bomb! we got a medium half baked ziti and half chicken marsala since we couldn't make up our minds. saw this on DDD and had to try it, glad we did and we will def be back next year when we come back for spring training."}
{"text":"First time here we ordered the Baked Ziti pizza since we heard it was a specialty of the house. The pizza was good but it was not one of my favorites. The sauce was very flavorful just not to my liking. My husband agreed with me, who is always looking to try new things, did not particularly care for the sauce either. Overall, this place is a must try for any Italian lover. The restaurant smells heavenily and the flavors are rich. Will definitely try thier other pizzas and pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Gilbert Pizza since high school and the pizza and garlic knots just keep getting better! Sal and his wife are amazing and their team always welcomes you like you're part of the family. If you're hesitant to stop in, trust me the garlic knots alone are worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Today was my third time at Sal's Gilbert Pizza,  just as great as the first 2 times!!  Keep up the great work! Best pasta, pizzas and of course the garlic knots with cheese!"}
{"text":"After seeing Sal's on TV and a pizza lover we decided to make the trip from Surprise to try the upside down siclian. It was delicious, being from Brooklyn anyone that know Spumoni Gardens this is the same pizza.  The best pizza we had since we moved here nine years ago.  I felt like I had finally found a little of home.  We also had a very nice young man as our server.  Definitely will be going back, a lot closer then going back to NY and better weather."}
{"text":"GO THERE. You're going to love it. I thought pasta on top of pizza sounded weird too, but it's fantastic. The spaghetti & meatballs pizza is even better than the baked ziti pizza. And the garlic knots are delicious. Eat them all!"}
{"text":"Fantastic calzones & great service! Ordered the vegetarian & the serving size was hugely delicious!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food is hard to come by in Arizona, they do a very good job of making me feel like I'm at home with their f"}
{"text":"We love to check out places we've never been, try something new. We support local business, and if we love a place, we share it with everyone we know, and i have to say this place was fantastic. It felt like walking into an small restaurant in Italia. The food was delicious and fresh! The garlic knots...wow...they were amazing. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this place!"}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA & real NY vibe!!! Great customer service, and family ran, to back the amazing food! Great place!!!"}
{"text":"5 star NY Italian quality all the way around in this packed pizzeria restaurant of the Gods.  From the deep red marinara sauce, to the garlic knots smothered in garlic and Parmesan to the perfectly crunchy and succulent veal cutlet.  Then top it off we started with some of the best spicy and perfectly cooked Buffalo wings and fried ravioli with ricotta.  And of course the classic finish of cannoli and a personal visit from Sal himself.  Here here, I will be back."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and had the baked ziti pizza and it was amazing!! ...actually dangerous. lol"}
{"text":"I'm an Arizona native and this is by far the best pizza I've had down here! The baked ziti pizza is absolutely amazing and the garlic knots are to die for! Don't waste another minute eating inferior pizza! Go to Sal's!!!"}
{"text":"I must've gone to Sal's at least 4-5 times in the last 2 months. What delicious, skanky food. I definitely can get down and dirty with their food. I have to definitely exhibit self control there. I am in love with their sausage Stromboli. I want to make love to it. It's finger licking good. Their hot garlic knots are to die for. My husband has gotten the eggplant parm sub the last couple times we've gone. He likes it that much. This place is definitely a people pleasing place. We will be back, consistently."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New Jersey and ever since Manhattan Joes closed, I've been searching for quality East Coast Style pizza. I remembered seeing something about a pizza place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and came across Sals Gilbert Pizza.  I decided to stop by on the way home from work on Saturday and pick-up my 2 xlg pizzas.  The place was busy but seemed to be humming along efficiently.
THE PIZZA:  Best East Coast pizza I've had since I moved west.  I met Sal and he and his staff were very friendly.  I will be treating myself to Sals again in the very near future.  If you want really good Pizza with super tasty crust, go to Sals!"}
{"text":"When I walked in I took a big whiff of the air. I became a little excited because it vaguely reminded me of New York. I sat patiently waiting. Looking at how every single table in this place was packed and there were four parties waiting to be seated, I imagined I was in for a treat. But alas, I am in Arizona, haven't lived in New York for 6 years and I simply need to learn to stop chasing the snake. New York pizza only exists in New York and I need to realize that GOOD pizza doesn't need to taste like New York pizza. However I do argue that it should still taste GOOD nonetheless. We had some wings, seemed frozen, typical stuff. I got a small salad, which was decent. The pizza, was average. The bolognese was simply marinara with meatballs, not bolognese. I really don't want to rate this place a 3 star location, I want to support the local restaurateur, but I have to cut the line somewhere. However I am not that familiar with Arizona and maybe this truly is the best place around. If that is true, than I am sorry."}
{"text":"Now this is pizza. Gilbert would be a ghost town if Sals didn't exist. I can't find any pizza place that comes close to the flavors this establishment unleashes."}
{"text":"My friends were here from out of state and wanted to try the same pizza that Guy Fierri from triple D. The ziti pizza.  I would have never ordered this myself but it was unique and tasty and surprisingly really good and very filling. One slice for me and I was full. They also ordered the white pizza and I had a slice the next day. It was really good cold and warm. I had to try it both ways. The following day I tried the cold ziti pizza. A first for me to try cold pasta. Live cold pizza but not pasta. I was impressed it was not stale and was still very good. If you want different pizza or even regular pizza you gotta try Sals. Service was really good our waitress was very patient with the two teenagers."}
{"text":"wonderful service.  Yes, they are busy, BUT the food is great.  The gals really work, during busy times, to give you a smile while you wait.  Pizza can be made to order during the lunch time specials.  Yum. Thanks, we'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"First off I saw the episode of triple D and thought to myself I have to try sal's pizza. second off I drive for Uber eats and I had a customer order the absolute most fragrant pizza I have ever had The pleasure of having in my car. Lastly I am a native New Yorker lived there 26 years Long Island Brooklyn Queens I even lived in Connecticut Sal's pizza is better than the pizza I had in Manhattan the first bite of the classic single slice pepperoni cheese supremely deliciously gooey melty the pepperoni had the right amount of crisp versus flavor the crust and sauce make for a better one to combo then Muhammad Ali ever could dream of I started to weep saying I felt home! Sal and everybody at Sal's thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything. Also sampled was the \"small\" antipasto salad that could feed two people and the baked ziti slice all of it amazing but the classic pepperoni"}
{"text":"Good pizza and family friendly restaurant but no wow factor for me.  I'm probably a little biased though coming from New York and Delaware (home of the Grotto pizza!)  The fried ravioli were a nice menu option though and very yummy."}
{"text":"Born and raised in New York, I've never been able to find an authentic New York slice in the valley. However after trying Sal's, I can comfortably say that this is the greatest slice of pizza I've ever had outside of New York State. The service was terrific, the owners, Sal and Grace very welcoming. From the moment I walked in the door, I was served garlic knots, on the house, and I didn't need to wait more than 5 minutes before getting my drink. Sal's Gilbert Pizza made me feel right at home! An easy 5 stars"}
{"text":"I'll admit, after reading the reviews we were dubious but willing to give it a try. The garlic knots were adequate but nothing special but they were a free appetizer so why complain?

Now the pizza-delish!! Unlike many places that only put a sprinkle of cheese, this one had copious amounts of cheese melting over the sides. Yummy!!!  The crust was also tasty and not too thick. This place is for those of us who love REAL NY pizza  

Our server was also on top of refilling drinks etc. Definitely a spot we will return to."}
{"text":"My first time here and the experience wasn't good. The food was decent enough, but when I went to the restroom with my friends 3yr old boy another server decided to throw away over half of my order. They hadn't even given me a check so, I have no idea why they thought we'd completed our meal. Look, mistakes happen and I understand that but their resolution was to take the soda off my bill and offer me free garlic knots, which are free anyway.  Not good."}
{"text":"Just as I was getting ready for my trip out to Arizona, I was watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and what do you know Guy Fieri is talking about Sal's Gilbert Pizza! It just happened that I was gonna be in the Gilbert, Arizona area on my trip....so how do I not stop by!

I live in Florida and what you never find there is a place that just sells pizza by the slice. That's all I ask for! Any family Italian restaurant you visit only sells pizza made to order. I visited Sal's for lunch, and not only do they have good lunch specials, they sell pizza by the slice!

And after complaining all this time that I never can find a place in Florida that sells slices, ironically I went for a chicken roll! There were plenty of tables and chairs to sit down and eat. The chicken roll was as good as can be and they gave me 2 cups of marinara sauce to dip it into. I was happy regardless of not getting pizza slices.

If Sal's opened a place in South Florida, they would do phenomenal!"}
{"text":"First off the pizza and the food quality is second to none. Second the staff is amazing and very friendly. when you put those together i would give this Gilbert staple a 7 star rating if i could. Having good food as a restaurant/bar is one this following it up with a great owner and staff is what keeps this place packed day in and out."}
{"text":"Service ruins the experience here. Moderately tasty pizza but service is awful. Better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand the bad reviews. Went here tonight for the first time and it has got to be some of the best pizza I ever had. And free garlic knots. How amazing is that."}
{"text":"New York-style in a desert. That's pizza, not your next LBD in the Sahara.  Which would be a mistake, I think.  Sal's, however, is not a mistake.  It's pretty good, although sometimes the slices are colder than a desert merits."}
{"text":"The pizza is super tasty and cooked perfectly. But one thing stands out above the rest and it's their garlic knots. They do not disappoint."}
{"text":"A delicious aroma as soon as we walked in to Sal's. Really neat open kitchen. Amazing salads, pasta, and pizza. We tried them all. Great service from their friendly and attentive staff. A big hit with my family. We'll be sure to return."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place from a friend, then my parents tried it, and said to check it out.

I was cautious at first. I'm from NJ, I've had good pizza and I've had good pasta from a pizza place... Man was this place good. 6.99 for a TON of food, and it's great, too! Just like home. 

I had the half portion vodka sauce over linguine, comes with a side salad and garlic knots. I couldn't finish it. I wanted to finish it. It was so delicious. So glad this place is right down the road. If you're from the east coast and have a craving for pizza from home or pasta from a pizza shop, like home. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Sal's was good. Not great, but good. 
We did the Yelp / Grubhub delivery option. The delivery time was great. Really only 30 - earlier than the 45-55. So, that was awesome. 

We ordered the Supreme Sicilian Pizza
Medium 14\" and some Bruschetta. They arrived maybe Luke warm?  Taste?  Okay. The Bruschetta at Blue 32 is much better. I suspect if you dine in the pizza would be a much better experience, especially for the price. ($21)"}
{"text":"Never disappoints can get slices or a whole pizza. Pasta pizza is good , so is cheesecake. Sometimes it's cried but carry out is quick too close to church my go too"}
{"text":"Sal's saved dinner Saturday when I was elbows deep in unpacking moving boxes (it's a long story) and realized it was approaching 2000, which severely limits options to order take away here in the 48th state. Placed an online order, they were slammed when we arrived about 35 minutes later to pick it up; staff was friendly and kept us in the loop as to the status of our order. 

I've been craving a Grandma Pie lately, and was very pleased with their medium ($16.99, +$3 for added sun dried tomatoes) this is one of my favorite pies, and Sal's nailed it, though I did order it with mozzarella vs the menu's provolone because that is how Nonna made her eponymous pies; I was super pleased with the chew, char, and quality of the crust, which I'd forgotten to order well done - usually just a preference on my part, as pies tend to be under-fired to me - but not at Sal's! Scott shared a cheese calzone ($7.99) with his buddy, and they both enjoyed it, especially since it wasn't coated in butter, oil, or WTF ever it is that many pizza joints out here tend to slather onto pies, calzones, et al with reckless abandon. The large antipasto salad ($10.99) was just AOK in my book, but I loved the balsamic dressing. There was a gratis order of garlic bread with a side of their tasty marinara the fellas enjoyed, too. Three of us were sated  for under $40, with plenty of leftovers to boot. 

This is the second time we've had take away from Sal's, thoroughly enjoying both meals. I'm kind of crushing hard on another family owned joint in Mesa, but we will include a sit down meal at Sal's sooner than later, as their food can only be better eaten straightaway, and I love family owned joints that remind me of my own dysfunctional Sicilian clan's roots. Fans for sure!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place a 3 is because the food it actually good, but the waitress we had was horrible. She was nice and acted like she knew what she was doing, but she forgot to put in our order for our appetizer and didn't write our order correctly for our pizza. Two strikes...I was hopeful that she would redeem herself and offer a free dessert or take the value of our drinks off the final bill or something, but nothing was offered. Three strikes, I'm done. 

The food is worth the try, but maybe do take out so you don't get the waitress whom does not have a name, but has a butterfly tattoo on the inside of her right arm."}
{"text":"I love this place! Found it by chance a month ago when the movie I wanted to see wasn't due to start for two hours. The waitress we had was very friendly and had great suggestions. I got the vodka pasta with penne, the best I've had, and my boyfriend got a calzone, which he loved. We also got garlic knots, mmm. We both only ate half of the portions and we were able to enjoy it for lunch the next day!

We've been back for take out pizza, that is pretty good too. We went in to sit down and eat last week and that time the waitress, was, well, a bitch. The food was still amazing, so I can over look the bitchness. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been getting Sals pizzas and salads to go for many years. They are simply the best in the area and we have an abundance of pizza places. This is an excellent product every time, years on end. The dining in experience is great also. The menu items and service are great. 
Keep up the good work. We are fortunate to have you in the area."}
{"text":"Tried the margherita  pizza. It was awesome!! Fresh ingredients and the crust was crispy. The restaurant was packed, but the wait for our food was not long. The garlic knots are complimentary and we enjoyed those while waiting for the pizza. I also tried a slice of the grandma pizza and I'll definitely have that again. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great value and good quality food! Pasta like back east!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Gilbert pizza many times. It delicious... However the girl behind the counter is the rudest person I've ever encountered in my life. Walked in she looked right at me didn't say a word. Just continued to wipe down the entire counter before slowly walking to the register and just asking me what I wanted... I placed an order over the phone... She snapped at me saying it would be 5 more minutes. Seriously bitch? How much do u care about your job? Let's try a little harder... I'll take my money and spend it else where. Who let's their staff treat their customers like that? She was rude to every single person who walked in after me."}
{"text":"Good pizza...although nothing to knock your socks off. The staff here is very friendly as well, and the Italian beer on tap is very good!  Expect this place to be packed with families and kids."}
{"text":"This review is simple: AWESOME!  Sal's is my favorite place for pasta... their penne pasta with meat sauce is my fav. Prices are good, complimentary garlic knots are good and everything is freshly homemade. Sal's is a real Gilbert gem! With the quality of the food Sal's will probably have to find a larger building in time as it can get quite crowded, but it's well worth the wait if there ever is one. This place absolutely deserves 5 stars. I go there at least once a week and never disappointed. Thanks for the awesome food Sal!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to pizza place.  I prefer to dine in because they give you all the garlic knots that you want.  You must try one of their specialty slices.  My favorite one that I have had so far is the Spaghetti and Meatballs.
Beside their pizza the entrees are also excellent."}
{"text":"Tried this with my 2 kids and wasn't sure how it worked for sitting down to eat ordering to go. Anyway found out you had to order then they give you a number so they can bring food to you. For 3 slices of pizza and an appetizer the total was $25!! I can buy a whole pizza pie with that! I hear from the reviews they offer free garlic knots...KNOT the case. In fact...I had very little interaction other than the lady who took my order. The server brought out food and just left it at table. No plates or utensils. They realized it and came back but again...no words. Sorry but this may be the last time I step foot here."}
{"text":"We have been going to Sal's pretty regularly for years. Seems like since they have been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives their service has gone down hill. We went there on a very busy night and waited almost 45 minutes, when I asked my wife to go check where we were in the queue because I saw people that arrived after us getting sat. Sal's wife said, \"Oops! We will sit you next!\" Turns out they skipped over us. No apology, nothing. More recently we went in late afternoon around 4:30 p.m. and sat down. We waited for 20 minutes, no one said anything to us. We tried to flag a couple people down, but couldn't get their attention so we left. The food is pretty good although a little expensive, but the service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in the valley. We live in chandler and refuse to eat pizza anywhere else. Amazing service and some of the most bad a$$ pizza around! And those garlic bites mmmmm"}
{"text":"We went for the first time on Saturday after seeing Sal on Diners Drive ins and Dives. It was also my birthday which was a special treat. The place does not disappoint. There was a short wait but seating at the bar top for a glass of wine while we waited. When we got seated we knew what we wanted right away.... The baked Ziti pizza from the show. It was a perfect balance of flavors. The creaminess of the sauce, the crispy crust and al dente noodles really made this thing amazing. To top it all off, Sal came out to the dining room to take a picture with me for my birthday. We cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST pizza I have had! Sal and the staff are awesome and friendly."}
{"text":"Very friendly people, good service, great variety on the menu. It's become a regular for a few years and the pizza? It'll be hard to find any better!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband love pizza and salad so we decided to give this place a try- since my uncle and parents had been raving about it. We ordered a meat lovers pizza and an antipasto salad. The antipasto salad was a side salad and decidedly tiny. It came with like two tablespoons of dressing... and suprisingly half of that was enough to cover this tiny yet $5 side salad. The pizza was not impressive. It was chewy and burnt at the same time- I don't know how they managed that. The sauce was not that great it tasted like pure sugar to me and the crust was favorless. There were a lot of toppings but for a 14\" pizza at $20- that is a bit reaching in my opinion. Also the teen girl at the counter looked aloof and was not that friendly and she left our receipt just sitting out on the counter. I had to toss it next to the receipt paper she had written down \"chase debit card...\". Be a little more careful with financial information please. Pretend you care about being there- make eye contact and smile at the guests. For the price point you can find much better pizza and definitely better service elsewhere. Unfortunatley, this joint does not live up to the hype. That's all."}
{"text":"First time at Sals. I ordered pick up on a Saturday night at 8pm. Glad I didn't lug my family of 5 down here tonight.  Packed house all seats taken PLUS about 10 people in line for a table.  Good for them.....wonderful problem to have.

Our white pizza was OUTSTANDING.......probably one of the best I've had. Next time I think I'll add some garlic to it.  Medium pepperoni for the kids, just as good.  Gilbert has some great locally owned pizza places, lived here a year and trying to test them all. Haven't had a bad one yet!!!!   Good job Sals, we'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Since Gilbert Pizza is located close to home, this restaurant has always been our go to place when my husband and I have a hankering for some good Italian food. However, what's great for them has been a lesson to me for my lack of patience.   Guy Fieri's recent visit for his Food Network DDD show has been bringing in the crowds. Tonight's wk. night visit was no different, the place was crowded and there was a 15-20 minute wait before we were seated, a first for us.  There seemed to be some disorder due to the influx of business seeing servers running around like chicken's with their heads cut off but given some time, thing's should iron out. We were seated at 6:30 and our main course didn't arrive  for a good hour. The always delicious garlic knots helped fill the time and satisfied my hunger. My combo eggplant/chicken parm was tasty as usual and the accompanying pasta w/marinara was boxed up to enjoy for lunch at another time. My husband's spaghetti w/meatballs and side of sausage was also quite tasty.  Does this place have some bugs to work out with the increase in business, absolutely!! Hopefully, the quality of their menu items won't pay the price for success. We'll be back...."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE! Sal and his staff are so kind. You really feel how much her prides his restaurant and recipes. He has the BEST garlic knots I've ever had and they're authentic not those crappy ones I've found at many other Italian restaurants in the valley and this is coming from 2 Italians! The food is great and the experience is as well. Sals is a must try on anyone's bucket list!"}
{"text":"Our first time dining at Sals and we were quite impressed. We ordered a kids cheese pizza, chicken Marcella and mussels appetizer. The salad that came with the dinner was fresh and crisp and served right away. However, we waited far too long for our mussels to arrive. Also, the kids pizza took a long time along with the chicken Marcella. The food is good but the service was slow. P.S. I saw my neighbors pizza arrive a lot faster then our appetizer did..."}
{"text":"We have been to Sal's several times, and it never disappoints.  I like that you can order pizza by the slice, as well as, a whole pizza.  They recently added on to the place, and there is hightops in addition to the really booths, and tables.  There is also a small gelato case now.  The food is always delicious, and the service is great!  One of our all time favorites!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in the Philadelphia area, and I know what good Italian Pizza should taste like, and Sal's is as good as it gets! The kitchen messed up with my wife's order on her salad, but immediately made it right! Won't go anywhere else for Pizza in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Gilbert Pizza 3 years ago by another New Yorker.  When I had my first slice of their cheese pizza I felt like I was back in New York.  Sal and Grace (the owners) made our family feel at home.  We visit regularly and have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered off their menu."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the first time after hearing the hubby go on about this place for months. He is not even a big fan of pizza but he loves this place. After trying it, I can definitely see why. Honestly, I have to say this is the best pizza I have ever had! I have been thinking and thinking digging back to my childhood but can't think of a better place for pizza than this. We ordered a large pizza with sausage and onion and an order of garlic knots. The knots were buttery cheesy little pillows of goodness and the marinara that was served with them was one of the best marinaras I have had (they tie with Rigatonies). I could have settled on just 4 orders of these bad boys and at 1.60 for an order of 6, that is what I think I might do for a cheap lunch one day! I have heard that sometimes they just give these out, however, you will want to order some just to be safe cause if you don't get them, you will be very sad. Cmon, they are a 1.60 now! Now for the pizza... the crust was the perfect thickness, not too thin, not too thick, and I loved how every bite was nice an crispy. The cheese on it was melty, gooey, greasy, and had almost a creamy consistency. Unlike any cheese I have ever had and out of this world! The sausage was very different as well. Its thin slices of meat almost resembling gyro meat but its sausage. I don't know where they get their cheese and sausage but I will tell ya that these are not your average run of the mill cheese and sausage. Whats nice is that you can tell that almost everything is made from scratch and with love. The marinara I am positive is home made, heck maybe even the cheese and sausage are home made. Haha. Since I work so close, I am going to have a problem especially in the weight department because I think I am going to go here a lot now! Anyways, if you are looking for the most awesome pizza you will ever have in your life at a reasonable price, you will get it here for sure!
A few tips: Sal, the owner, is a bit standoffish but I think he is very serious about his pizza that he doesn't have time to talk to customers. Don't take it personally. Haha. Also, after 4, this place turns into an actual restaurant so if you want cheaper, you will wanna go for lunch or really really early dinner so you don't have to tip."}
{"text":"We moved here from NY just under a year ago. This is the BEST pizza we have had since we've been here!! The crust is perfect and the sauce is delicious!! Nothing else we have tried has even compared. If you're from NY or NJ and want a taste of home, this is it!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god.. The garlic knots!!! These things just melt in your mouth, fresh garlic, just delicious. Their pizza is just perfect ny style, thin and extra tasty. This place gets very busy but the waiters just manage, is just amazing. Carbs and more carbs, live it up!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Great food and great service! We had the white clam pasta and the meat lovers pizza. Don't forget to order the mini cannoli for dessert. Yum!"}
{"text":"We keep coming  back. Love the food and the crew.

Best Pizza Gilbert, Arizona - Sal's Gilbert Pizza: https://youtu.be/56hCXkkT5-s"}
{"text":"Some of the best NY style pizza in AZ. Their Chicken Parmesan is the best. My wife loves their Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. Its about a 20 min drive for us but its always worth it."}
{"text":"I think this place is a great Gilbert Restaurant it is so good and tastes like everything is homemade, we came in right before closing, and instead of being told we couldn't have this or that, the server encouraged us to get what we wanted even with 10min until closing.We have been back several times since."}
{"text":"OMG is all I can say! The pizza is great, but the entrees are amazing! I am from Long Island and Sal has the best Italian food here by far! And I have to plug the vodka sauce. Just amazing!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! 

My husband and I are from NYC and we were missing the pizza.  Now we can have NY pizza in Gilbert, AZ. 

It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Gilbert. And the service was great. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"After suggestions from many out of town in Chicago as well as locals here in Chandler we decided to visit Sal's. Their pizza and pasta are ALL handmade here at the biz and taste like it. We ordered the white pizza, the pepperoni (called traditionalist) as well as baked ziti and their homemade Alfredo with my daughters favorite penne pasta. All of which was excellent. Their thin crust was stellar as well as homemade marinara (on the traditionalist) and ricotta on the white pizza. Super happy on Kyle their server and had a surprise visit by Sal the owner. This place is killer and makes you feel like home. I would give them 10 stars if I could for the all around performance of hometown cooking and amazing feel. Can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Such a great place. Some of the most friendliest staff around. Talk about amazing hospitality. Even the owner, Sal greeted us and asked how everything was. Wings were awesome, n they even made us honey hot flavored since  wasn't on the menu. Definitely coming back. Thanks Sal."}
{"text":"Sals was pretty good! I'm a big fan of grimaldi's, but we tried something new. The garlic knots were so good and the pizza was good as well. I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered their pizza the other night and it was absolutely great day wasn't anything I could say bad about it. It had just the right amount of sauce and cheese in the crust was perfect. So good I'm going to order again and make them my first on the list"}
{"text":"Went here again a couple of times and it has gotten worse. It takes forever to be seated. 

We ordered a pizza the last time we were here and the crust was bland, the pizza was dripping with grease, so much that we had to soak it up with napkins and the service was slow, mediocre and unpleasant. 

We won't be coming back. Spinato's is way better."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a NY transplant and I have been coming here every couple weeks ever since. Everything I have tried is great - White pizza and garlic knots are awesome. High quality ingredients, lots of cheese and the crust is perfect."}
{"text":"The baked ziti pizza is the best pizza I've ever had. I can't ever order anything else from there because it's too good not to get. Before every marathon I've ran, I get this pizza. Then I enjoy the leftovers after my race. I always offer to take people here just so they can experience the greatness of this pizza. Pizza and pasta uniting for one dish is truly a magical experience. The free garlic knots they serve before you're dish are delicious as well. It's tempting to order more!"}
{"text":"We ordered via DoorDash but the food was awesome ! We got a thin crust xl pep pizza.  It is not thin crust like crunchy but just thinner than the regular crust .  The crust has a perfectly balanced flavor and the sauce is not to chunky or watery .  We got a free order of garlic pesto knots (OMG AMAZING ) .  We also ordered a large antipasto salad that was loaded with all the best Italian deli meats and came with plenty of dressing on the side as well .  We were watching my nephew ( who is on the Autism spectrum and is very picky eater ) and he 2 slices which was very atypical for him so we were very delighted .   Very good overall quality and taste . No complaints from us ."}
{"text":"WARNING:  Don't order the veal.

My brother heard about Gilbert Pizza from a co-worker, who happens to live in the area.  The guy gave it high praises and said it was the best Italian food he has eaten in Arizona, so we decided to check it out.  There were three of us, my brother, his wife, and myself, and we all had different entrees.  The chicken Marsala, chicken Parmigiana, and the veal Parmigiana   I thought it was nice that they bring a dish of garlic knots to the table to start you off.  My brother and his wife were happy with the chicken dishes.  They thought the sauce was decent, the sides of pasta was done well, and the portions of chicken was ample.

I figured I would try the veal since most Italian places don't offer it and I haven't had any veal in years.  I did ask the waitress before ordering if it was real veal and not a veal patty.  She said it wasn't a patty, which it wasn't.  What she failed to say was that it was a sheet of paper.  If it was any thinner,  it would've been invisible.  For $16.99, I got mostly breading and cheese.  I'll stick to my favorite Arizona Italian restaurant for an authentic Italian dinner, Va Bene's.   As for Gilbert Pizza, it's not so va bene."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on a weekday evening. Walk in, several tables open with a 5-10 minute wait. No big deal. Pretty small crowd. Sit down, order right away when we get our drinks. It took over 50 minutes to get one pizza and a kids spaghetti. The people behind us who were seated 10-15 minutes AFTER us, received their food before we did.  We eventually just had to leave and get our food to go. Our waitress was very nice and said she didn't know what was going on. Keep in mind this was not a busy night. 

Oh and they charge $9.50 to add chicken to a pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered a white pizza + sausage for delivery tonight, and this is what we got.  Does this look like a white pizza?  I'm so bummed."}
{"text":"We love this place! Definitely get the garlic knots and the pesto chicken pizza is great and it good reheated the next day too!"}
{"text":"Kayla answered all my questions . I was hard to understand with all that was around me . She was patient and expedient . This place was recommended to us ; and for good reason!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I ever had! The customer service was great even though we had to wait a little but it's understandable the place is very busy and the waitress was running around and even like that she managed to still provide excellent service! Now the pizza you can order new work style or Sicilian style or get it by the which is pretty awesome! There's this one that has pasta as a topping and I won't lie at first I was skeptical but once I bit into it.... Whoa!! Amazing!!! I'll be returning soon delicious pizza hahah"}
{"text":"I am a New Yorker, born and raised! I've lived on the west coast for 12 years and have yet to be impressed with any Italian food or pizza, especially those claiming to be New York style!

That is until now!!! Sal's Gilbert Pizza is the real deal! The pizza is amazing, the antipasto salad is unbelievable, the garlic knotts are delectable and the cannoli are to die for!

This food would be Googie approved (my Italian grandmother!)

We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Absolutely dreadful service. Waited an hour and a half for a calzone... And then found out they never started it!? They comped a couple slices of pizza that were good NY style pizza. Lasagna came out right on time and was delicious. They are grossly under staffed and the staff they have isn't trained. Great food if you have the whole evening to spend waiting!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food wasn't very flavorful not a fan won't be back. Which is a shame because I loved the atmosphere"}
{"text":"There is a reason Sal's Gilbert Pizza appeared on \"Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives\": it is quite possibly some of the best pizza and Italian food in the east valley. We've had carry out and we have dined in countless times - each time just as positive and amazing as the last. The staff is friendly and treat you like family, the food is AMAZING, and the price is always right. Free garlic knots are the BEST. Like, we're always surprised we don't have to pay for the garlic knots - they're wonderful! You would be hard pressed to find a better pizza place in the east valley."}
{"text":"We went there tonight for the first time. The garlic knots are fantastic. Our friends have been there many times and they custom order the Penne Paesano, not found on the menu (Sal's is open to that, which is awesome). We followed their lead and ordered it ourselves. It was outstanding. It must have looked as good as it tasted, because someone at the next table asked what we were having and he ordered it. He said it was really, really good.

I worked in Little Italy in Toronto for years. I feel I know good Italian food...this is really good Italian food. Also, the portions were huge and the prices are reasonable. I will certainly be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Very good food nice to see they went to full serves. One of the best pizzas in Gilbert luckily we have some good pizza restaurant's here."}
{"text":"Pizza that seems so wrong but is so right! 

After you sit down at Sal's, you are offered complimentary garlic knots...Wait, did they just say complimentary???!! Crap, now we are filling up on these glorious bread bites and marinara dipping sauce. 

But, save room for the pizza! 

We tried four different slices: Baked Ziti (pasta noodles with mozzarella cheese and pink sauce), Chicken Marsala (mushrooms, onions, and chicken and a marsala wine sauce), Grandma (thin crust with provolone, marinara sauce and basil) and Traditionalist (a classic pepperoni with double meat & extra cheese).

Our favorite of the bunch was Grandma. The stewed tomatoes were perfection and the provolone was so mild it was almost unnoticeable except it added a nice amount of extra crispiness to the edges of the pizza that was so good. 

Both the Baked Ziti Pizza (the center section of a Pizza/Pasta Venn Diagram) and Chicken Marsala Pizza (the center piece of a Pizza & Chicken Dinner Venn Diagram) are like two meals in one. These pizzas are really interesting because initially the combinations don't seem like they should work -- A classic Italian meal on top of another classic Italian meal... Yeah, actually that sounds great! Can I get another slice? Definitely, a delightful surprised! 

Of the two, I feel the Chicken Marsala Pizza tasted better and deserves more love than then the more photogenic Baked Ziti Pizza. If you feel like trying more of the specialty pies, Sal's also offers other options like: Lasagna Pizza, Spaghetti & Meatballs Pizza, and if you are looking for a little bit of Desert Heat, the pizza of the same name features sausage, jalapeños, green chiles & extra cheese.

Service was real friendly and the energy of the establishment is warm and inviting. On top of all the, the price was great! For two of us, we spent just $20 (including tip) for two complimentary plates of garlic knots and 4 slices of pizza. We left fully stuffed and I even took some food back for breakfast the next day... Hey, stop judging, breakfast is important!"}
{"text":"Food is great as always! Chicken Marsala is awesome. Baked Ziti pizza and cheese pie is delicious. Wait was not to bad. Kid at wait stand needs to know what he is doing.  A lot of empty tables and people waiting.  Let them wait while sitting at the table.  Maybe need more waiters. Oh well."}
{"text":"Wish there was a 10 star rating, because I would give it to Sal's. Amazing food, personable staff in a clean, friendly environment. Best pizza in the valley. 

My family and I are from the East Coast, and we really haven't found an authentic Italian restaurant we truly enjoy. Im second generation Italian American....and this place reminds me of all my local spots back in Jersey and NYC. 

Sal's Gilbert Pizza is awesome!"}
{"text":"Best Italian pizzeria in the valley!!!! I don't have to visit my home town in Ny anymore that I discovered Sals. Get a Sicilian pie and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So far, not impressed. When I came in, the guy at the counter didn't seem to understand English. I said this is my first time here. How does this work? Due to there being pizzas in this glass cabinet. He just looks at me so I see a menu and say I'll just look at the menu. Then a lady comes up and says, this is your first time here? I say, yes. As that happening, this lady asks for garlic knots. The woman heats them up in a microwave in a styrofoam container. They do have Pepsi, which is nice! I had the calzone. It was really pretty good. The tea is a little weak, but drinkable."}
{"text":"In town visiting family and this is their new favorite pizza place. We got a large round pizza and a large rectangle pan pizza with a side of garlic knots. Got it home, opened up the boxes and... Nothing special."}
{"text":"Worth the drive, wish they'd open one in the west valley, so good, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't live in Arizona but do travel to Arizona as much as we can. We saw this restaurant on Diners Drive Ins and Dives and have made it a point to eat here whenever we are in town.  I especially LOVE the ziti pizza so of course we both had a slice of that plus a chicken marsala slice. We also shared spaghetti and meatball entree. Everything was delicious. The employees are all really nice and the owner came out again to say hello. The restaurant is clean and the decor is very pleasant. They offer daily specials and they open at 10am yes!! We will always stop here to eat every time we are in this great state!!"}
{"text":"Hate to rate a local business so low but have to keep it real. Sal's is overrated and overpriced. 

Grabbed pick-up which took an hour but the place was jam packed so timing made a bit more sense once I got there. I mentioned a buy one get one special coupon with my order but they failed to apply when I paid. They did run a credit back to my card which was great, but the hassle just added to the poor experience. 

The spaghetti and meatballs pie was gross and our Pepperoni pie was over cooked. Nothing special about their pizza!

I will not return as there are superior NY style pizza joints across Gilbert (Casanova Brothers, Brooklyn V's, Nicantoni's to name a few). 

Who in their right mind would have suggested Guy and his 3D crew to come here?"}
{"text":"Best pizza we have had since we moved to Arizona. The thin crust was excellent and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Sal's for a little while. When we walked in we were pleasantly surprised. They took over the area next to them and remodeled. It looked very nice. The food is still wonderful as ever and very resonable. The restaurant is just like an italian restaurant from New York.First you are brought out delicious warm garlic knots full of garlic. We ordered baked Zita . I came with a large salad. The salad was fresh with spring lettuce not just the regular head lettuce. The dressing are home made. We split the dinner and were stuffed. The pizza is amazing. You will never have pizza like this before, They even have Ziti pizza, Ceasar salad pizza. Very original and you can even order by  the slice. Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"Good people and good food here at Sal's!  

We ordered a Large Supreme Pizza and a Small Dinner Salad.  The salad was not small and it was delicious and had artichoke hearts, yea!  The pizza came out cooked to perfection.  It is easy to get a soggy pie when you order a combo or supreme, but this came out fresh and crispy.  The toppings were all fresh and the cheese seemed to be shredded fresh.

Good Job Sal, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Kyle was our server/bartender and he was AWESOME! We were here during the rush and had the opportunity to watch the staff work, greet people, answer phones, deliver food. They were all working so hard with smiles on their faces. It's our first time here and we are beyond thrilled with the level of service. We will be back, and will be willing to wait an hour for a table if need be! You guys are great (and the food is phenomenal also!)"}
{"text":"Drove all the way over there. Walked in. Asked for a table for 3. The girl at the front said sit anywhere you want. Sat at a table for 12 mins while multiple employees walked RIGHT passed us, looked RIGHT at us and said NOTHING. So I had to explain to my two little boys that we had to go somewhere else for pizza. Not an easy thing to do with a 4 and 6 year old."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. I phoned in an order and was told 45 to pick up. I arrived right about 45 minuets later then waited over an hour extra. 
To add insult to injury mediocre Luke warm food and half the order was wrong including leaving my babies slice of pizza out of the order."}
{"text":"I'm a native New Yorker and  in my opinion, Sal makes the BEST pizza in Arizona and the baked ziti is AWESOME. And Kelly is the best waitress :-)"}
{"text":"Again we wanted to try a new pizza place after spending an hour on yelp searching for one around us we landed on this one. We got seated fast and our waitress brought us twisted garlic nots which was so good. We went through two plates of them. We order our pizza and it looked good but it was flimsy and the crust was flavorless."}
{"text":"I live in Gilbert and wanted to give this place a try since my brother had brought me a slice and I loved it so I called in an order ( A cheese slice and an order of garlic knots) and went to pick it up shortly after. I got there went to the counter and politely asked about my order and the lady was VERY rude, I wish I would have looked at her name tag. She snatched the money out of my hand and walked away, sometime after another younger girl asked me if I had been help and all I could reply was \" I don't know\" .I explained how the other lady took my money and walked away. She asked for my name and gave me my food, I left happy to be getting out of there. The pizza was good but the garlic knots not so much, even though the slices were good I don't see myself going back for the simple fact that if i'm spending money in an establishment I would like to be treated with respect."}
{"text":"As someone who lived their whole life in NY and worked at a NY pizzeria for 3+ years, this is some of the best pizza outside of NY.

If I was to move outside of NY, the valley area would be my only choice as my body is dependent on good pizza. And that's thanks to Sal's!"}
{"text":"It took me almost three years to find Sal's, and good NY Pizza, in the east valley. I am not sure why it took me so long to try Sal's, as it is a staple and was on DDD.  Cool, casual spot to eat and very family friendly. Also had takeout that was just as good. The baked ziti pizza is incredible. Pasta, pizza, the best of both worlds. I would say specialty pies are the way to go, although the basics are solid too. I still need to try the chicken marsala pizza, another one of their best supposedly. Good reason to go back this weekend! Wings are decent and garlic knots are a huge bonus. Thanks for coming through with great NY Pizza Cuffaros!"}
{"text":"If you live in Gilbert this is the place to go for pizza it's the best place I know in Arizona that makes great pizza great service and very nice people"}
{"text":"we haven't been here in a while but this place hands down still has the best pizza. Being from NYC it's so hard to find great real NY pizza, I'm so glad we found this gem. Great customer service, awesome servers. Gotta try the calamari and the cannoli too."}
{"text":"First time here. Sunday, Noon. The pizza & garlic knots were very good! However the lady running the counter was far from friendly. Upon entering she asked her eat in or take out? I said in some eat in, she said sit anywhere. I am sat but saw other people sitting with numbers signs. Not sure if I did something wrong I never had a number. Then upon paying I realized my wallet was in the car, took my check to the front, tried showing her my car and apologizing that I'd be right back. She simply said \"ok. I came back and paid and she said nothing. No thank you, no come again, it was cold and awkward. So is a toss up, good pizza for ride service??"}
{"text":"I went to Sals on a Friday night, big mistake. I ordered lagsana and girlfriend ordered penne pasta. We waited 45 minutes and were at this little table that hardly fit our food. The people on both sides of us came and order 10 15 mins after us and they were eating, finally I ask ed the girl and she said she would check. 2 mins later she brings lukewarm food to us and I let her know that it wasn't even hot. She says she will warm it. My Lagsana wasn't even 'layered it was like all splattered. So I couldn't even finish it meatballs still wasn't hot. We asked for boxes and and she brings back the boxes and said she could only give us a tiny bit off - very strange since I didn't ask and it ended up being a dollar. The customer service has always been poor, but this was the worst by far."}
{"text":"I've dined in twice and have ordered take out from here many times as this place is about 5 minutes from my home. It's cool this joint was featured on DDD and has some decorations from the occasion inside. My personal favorites are the baked ziti pizza, antipasto salad and chicken & eggplant parmesan. The garlic knots are also really good when you eat in! Very casual inside but the food is pretty good. We will keep returning!"}
{"text":"I now eat gluten free, and usually pizzas are like cardboard.  Although the crust is still flat as the others are, it is very tasty.  I would recommend it.  (I need to invent a gf pizza crust that is not flat.)

The GLUTEN FREE PASTA is the best I've ever tasted.  Of course the sauce was magnificent.  

Had a nice chat with the owner about gluten free.  So glad he knows about it."}
{"text":"The food is delicious 10 stars all the way..  The meat lovers pizza and the spaghetti & meatball pizza are very YUMMY.  Also wanted to try the vodka sauce dish and ordered the 1/2 order size however the waitress put it in as a full order and charges us for it.  When we questioned her she said  it was not her fault said she due to the noise in the restaurant.   Just make sure you have them repeat your order before placing it
Or you could be paying more than you think."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Sal's for the first time today even though I drive by all the time on my way to work. Love the atmosphere! They have two dining areas, but we ate in the first one you would enter coming in the front door which appeared to be the more casual of the 2, although I didn't go look at the other one closely. They have some unique items on display up front like ziti pizza which I ordered in addition to my Stromboli (I was starving!). I got sausage and peppers in it and my girlfriend got some kind of pasta not sure which, but it was all fantastic. Service was quick, with garlic knots delivered to the table very quickly. Very friendly staff checked in to make sure everything was good, and the dining area had lots of people enjoying themselves. I'm sorry it took so long to go but now that I have I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza's good but I go for the Cannolis! Being that I'm from NYC I like real pizza ovens and not conveyor belt pizza. When I'm lucky they have pizza from earlier in the day and they have to reheat it. Then the crust is crunchy and the pizza reminds me of NYC! It's not real pizza unless the oil is running down your forearm! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday around lunchtime.  You order at the counter like you would at Sparro....and essentially pick your slice of pizza combo. I find it annoying that you're expected to tip after placing your order and getting a plastic number to place on your table.  What exactly am I tipping for?  It's weird...but then if I don't tip I worry they'll give me crappy food lol 
I ordered plain cheese, my husband ordered the baked Ziti slice and the chicken marsala slice....they were wow good! 
I can't imagine ordering a whole pizza with these types of toppings but for two slices it's perfect. 
So 4 slices,  two of them specialty ones, and two sodas all for $17 lunch special. We'll be back. By the way you don't get free garlic knots with the lunch specials fyi."}
{"text":"Sal's is my favorite N.Y. style pizza in the east valley. The crust is perfect and the cheese and toppings are excellent quality and delicious. Start off your meal with the garlic knots and you won't regret it! A few of my other favorites are the Toscana salad, chicken parmigiana and baked ziti. Finish off with their cannoli and you've got the perfect meal."}
{"text":"I like Sals because I feel like I am walking into a legit Italian pizza joint. I love seeing Sal working hard in the back and talking with all his regular guest. It makes me wanna get to know Sal! 

The service is always good, not great. The pizza is good, not great. The wings are GREAT! 

Be prepared to wait, especially if you are a big group. 

Great local business that I will continue to support. I will find a GREAT pizza on their menu."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a pitcher of beer and a pizza. The pizza was outstanding, the toppings excellent, overall a good pizza joint."}
{"text":"Always great food, great service.  Their white pizza is fantastic, and all of the pizzas are topped generously.  Besides the white pizza, my other favorite is the sausage & peppers.  The sauces are all made in-house, and the ingredients are better quality than most other places."}
{"text":"Busy place from Triple D show. Great customer service but be ready to possibly have a wait. We got garlic knots with marinara once seated. Tried their specialty pizzas. Did half lasagna and half spaghetti/ meatball pizza. Fav was lasagna but id get without ricotta as theres blobs of it on top vs all thru it so you get a mouthfull in one bite a little to much in one bite for me. It is definitely filling."}
{"text":"We dined at Sal's this afternoon with a group of 14 unannounced. We are from Tucson bringing 11 special needs adults on a few days of adventure around Phoenix. We had seen this place from a program on tv. Looked so delicious!! So we fit it into our schedule to go. When I say it looked delicious, that was a serious understatement!!! The food was beyond amazing!!!! We ordered 3 Pizza pies, 2 types of salad, and 3 appetizers. Everything was fresh, pizza and appetizers came out hot, and loaded with flavor!! The Baked Ziti Pizza was a huge hit!! The food was beyond what we had hoped for. The service was just as great!! We don't always get lucky bringing a group like ours to restaurants. Sometimes we get annoyed looks from other customers, sometimes we get bad service so that we would leave quicker. It is sad but it happens. But not here!!! The second we arrived we were greeted with smiles by everyone and felt more welcome than ever. Even the owner said hello to us and welcomed us. Our waitress, Kelli, was so lovely. She was so warm and wonderful with everyone. She talked with each person in our group and even remembered their names. She is just an amazing person!! She was also very efficient with everything!! Everything we ordered was correct and we never had empty glasses or sauces. I just can't say enough good things. Even after the long day of activities we had where our group would be rolling out of a restaurant exhausted and cranky, everyone was full of smiles and laughter. I will always try and come back here and will always recommend this place. A Big Huge thank you to all of you at Sal's Gilbert Pizza for a wonderful experience!!

{"text":"I have heard lots of great things about this place. I went in for lunch and found that it may be a better place for dinner. There were not very many pizza choices. From what I ordered, one slice came without the topping I asked for. I sent it back. They just added the toppings and brought it back. I ended up with an expensive, dry, burnt, and tough piece of pizza. I will be coming back to try for dinner to see if there is a change."}
{"text":"Usually like the food here but today went to pick up order had to wait another 20 min. Spaghetti was dry and there was a dead fly in my salad. Will not be eating here again"}
{"text":"As always, excellent food with large portions! Our waiter Steven was AWESOME!! My dad even complimented on his service, and my dad isn't easily impressed!! Kudos Steven!!"}
{"text":"I  catered from here the other day and everything was fantastic.  I told them how many people I had and I wanted some pizzas and some anti-pasta salads and they were spot on with the amount of food they gave me.  They even had everything ready on time.  The specialty pizzas are awesome especially the chicken marsala. I had a fried calamari pizza special ordered.  Even the regular pizzas like cheese or pepperoni pizzas are very good too.  Nice to have a real Italian making real Italian food!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was a bit of a let down. I went in to order a slice and a salad and sat down at the counter.  The crust was good, the toppings ie the meat was good. What was lacking was sauce and cheese, I asked if I could get a cup of sauce to dip the pizza in and was told, \"nobody else is complaining\" that comment will keep me from coming back.  They could learn from Grimaldis."}
{"text":"Good, but not great.  The only thing that really stood out were the garlic knots that were brought to the table before we even put in our drink order.  They were really good!  As for the rest of the food, I ordered a small house salad to split between 3 people.  Definitely big enough, but the salad was skimpy on the good stuff like the artichoke hearts (only got 2 quarters) and roasted red pepper.  The balsamic vinaigrette came out in this little shaker bottle which you had to shake like crazy just to get a little bit of dressing out...and I like very minimal dressing on my salad.  I can't imagine how long one would have to shake it if they wanted to drench their salad.

As for the rest of the food, we got a white pizza with tomatoes (which are considered a premium topping).  Really?  Tomatoes a premium topping at an Italian restaurant?  Anyway, We've order white pizzas every time we order pizza and this was my least favorite so far.  Incredibly bland....and too much ricotta (which was also very bland and sweet tasting).  The wings my son ordered were small and pricy too.  And $7 for a glass of their house cab seemed a bit steep also.

I'm glad we tried it, but with so many other great Italian/pizza places around, we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"We went there as a group and were quite happy with the service. Our servers were friendly, and quick to make sure all our needs were met. I had the chicken parmesan and it was brilliant! Two pieces of white chicken breast, tender and juicy, breaded and coated with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. Loved it :) our group had a large array of foods and everyone's food was perfect. Check out the photos and don't forget to try the garlic knots...yummm"}
{"text":"This place surprised us. We had no idea of it's Diners Drive-ins and Dives history, we thought we were getting strip mall by the movie theater quality and we were pleasantly surprised. Friendly, attentive service, family owned and delicious. Pizza is crispy, sauce is great, cheese is amazing (they use the REAL, good stuff), and crust was great. I don't normally like fried ravioli but that was awesome too, highly recommend. This place was a gem to find!"}
{"text":"Not really happy with what I saw. They don't make your food fresh for you and hot, the garlic knots just get sat in a huge bowl to sit and go cold, and then they microwave it for you .... Even hungry howies makes your bread hot and fresh. I've never been here before tonight and probably won't return depending upon the taste of this food I don't even have the stomach to try."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Try the white pizza! The service is always great, as well. The prices are fair and portions are generous. This is one of the best restaurants in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Although I love the place I had a really bad experience tonight with a pickup order.   I called in and was told it would be 35 minutes. So I arrived at the correct time but it took another 25 minutes to get my pizza. I stood around waiting. Then when I got home, the bottom of the pizza was burnt. In other words I stood around not for my pizza to cook, but 


Update:  within 24 hours Sals Pizza called me and bent over backwards to make it right. Since I normally love their pizza I'm adjusting the review to reflect their good faith effort to make it right. They really were swamped that night and I would still rather drive the extra 15 minutes to them than to go to one of those cardboard tasting chain pizza stores."}
{"text":"If you don't like baked ziti then it's safe to say you've never been to Sal's. Their baked ziti is the best I've ever encountered, perfectly paired with their garlic knots. Compliments to the chef, thanks Sal!"}
{"text":"I love supporting this local, family owned, small business. They do so much for others and are wonderful people. And the food is incredible!"}
{"text":"OMGOMGOMG! Pizza is totally worth the drive for me (about 20 minutes, but who's counting!) Perfect pie, no matter what you order. Even good carryout. Family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Traveling from California back to Houston with my husband and 2 children. We saw this place on Diners Drive-ins and Dives and HAD to make this stop, AND WE ARE SO HAPPY THAT WE DID! I can't say enough great things... About or whole experience.

We ordered a pizza with chicken marsala and baked ziti...holy cow! Amazing. 

Our waitress was unforgettable, just amazing and so sweet! We were lucky enough to meet Sal, the owner and he was just as nice... He sent over complimentary Canolis, and they were amazing, just like the rest of our experience. 

If giving them a 10 star rating were possible, that's what it would've been. I'm sad we live so far away."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good, but make sure you get it well done so it has a little crisp. Its New York thin pizza. They have some really great special pizzas like the baked ziti. I think I would rather have my pasta on a plate but Its unique and actually I want to try it. The owners are very nice. I went in and they were trying something new. They look like cinnamon rolls but the are pizza rolls. Dough rolled up like a cinnomon roll with toppings and sauce between the roll. I asked what they were and she told me and than gave me 5 of them for free. Dam that was so cool of them. The wings here are really good and the calzones looked delicious. Ill be back next time I'm out that way. Again ask for the pizza well done!"}
{"text":"this time around the service was a lot better.  there were menus actually on the table (instead of having to wait 10 minutes for them) and we were brought glasses and complimentary garlic knots.  
the ladies came by a couple times asking if we were ready, and after we ordered they even brought a 2nd order of garlic knots while we were waiting.
we got the white pizza and added garlic to it.  i think without the garlic it would have been very bland.  its a nice blend of mozz and ricotta though.  we also got the baked ziti pizza again.  it was a 'soupier' than last time, but still good.  last time was definitely better.
lastly, be prepared to wait.  the pizza takes soooo long to come out so don't go so hungry."}
{"text":"We use Uber Eats and order Sals often.  Their food is absolutely delicious! I love their spaghetti pizza, and my daughter loves their spaghetti. It's a win-win! Their large pizzas are on the larger side, so they are perfect for large groups. They also have gluten-free options, so we love Sals when we have friends over with gluten allergies.  

If you're looking for a really really really good pizza, look no further! 

And seriously, you have to try spaghetti meatball pizza!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! The Sicilian pizza and garlic knots are super delicious and everyone is super friendly!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for authentic NY pizza. It's so good I drive from north west Mesa all the time. Any negative reviews about the pizza and crust can only be from those who have either gotten use to bad pizza or have never had pizza from NY."}
{"text":"A recent experience has caused me to me to renew my faith in this establishment staff and management."}
{"text":"Sal's is a great Italian restaurant.   We love the pizza and spaghetti.  My kids love their spaghetti the most.  Very friendly service. Usually Sal takes the time to say hello.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"The food was really good ... I'd like to say that first. I enjoyed the garlic knots very much. The sausage on the pizza was really tasty too. 

When we walked in there was no sign that said \"seat yourself\" as there should be. We stood there for a couple minutes feeling kind of silly. I finally walked up to the counter and told the lady we were there for dinner. She said we could seat ourselves. We quickly sat down at the only booth available when a small boy approached our table and sat down 2 cups and a plate of garlic knots, confused I asked him if we were in his seat. He turned around and walked away .... Apparently they employ a 10 year old relative at this establishment ... We waited about 13 minutes before we were acknowledged by a waitress who informed us we could fill our own cups from the fountain drink station. It seemed to take a long time to get our pizza. Someone did drop off a second plate of 6 garlic knots on the table while we were waiting though. When our food arrived it was explained to us that a portion of the pizza had fallen on the floor so they had to throw it away but we could start eating what she had brought to the table (about three quarters of a pizza) and a second would follow free of charge. We had just finished the first partial pizza when the second arrived. We were too full to eat any of it so we took it home with us. I was slightly disappointed when we reheated it the sauce had lost most of it's taste by the next day. Again, after finishing our food we waited a long time for a waitress to bring us our check. I told my husband to pay in cash because I didn't want to sit there and wait another 15 minutes for the waitress to pick up the check, another 15 minutes for her to run the credit card and return it to us. 

We may go back because the pizza was really good but you better believe it'll be carry out only!"}
{"text":"Despaired of ever finding decent pizza.  Got takeout from Sal's that was amazing!  18\" pepperoni, half black olives and half meatball with extra cheese.  Great crust, delicious sauce, stringy-melty mozzarella and shaved homemade meatballs that taste like the one's I make myself!  Awesome pizza, ready exactly when they said it would be and about $24.00.  We will be back to eat in,  I want to taste those garlic knots!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to check out the renovation and eat at my favorite place.  I was disappointed to state the least.  Not one familiar face, new people that were not trained and it must have carried over into the kitchen too as my dish was less than stellar.  The chicken in the pasta special was SO overlooked it was dark and dry.  Waitress was sweet but completely overwhelmed.  Service was very very slow.  Nearly one hour to get our meal.  Salads took 15 minutes?  Ugh. Familiarity is part of the charm in this place; none of that last night.  
We will be back again but likely wait a couple months until new staff is trained."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this is the grossest pizza I've EVER had. The grease bled through the bottom of the box, I used countess paper towels to sop up the grease from the top of ONE PIECE of pizza and the crust was soggy and dripping with grease. The salad dressing was watered down/liquid thin. I spent $34 on a dinner delivered by Uber that went into the garbage with the exception of their garlic knots, which were surprisingly delicious.  Will never order from here again, nor will I recommend Sal's to anyone. Disappointed to say the least..."}
{"text":"Sal's, you may remember us. When we lived in AZ, my fiancee and I would order from you once a week. My now husband and I moved to California over a year ago. Our amazing Arizona friends brought us our most favorite of all foods, your ziti pizza! They muled it across state lines for us!  PLEASE move out here to 92653. I promise the weather is better. We love and miss you and your ziti pizza. All praise your noodley goodness. Ramen!"}
{"text":"FIRST OFF, no parking for UFO'S. Made me mad since I did come from the 3rd moon of Jupiter. SECOND OFF, No Guy from the show. Think he would stay there if he loved it so much. Enough bad comedy now on to the review.  Like a lot that post here the service is bad, no really bad. The staff just doesn't care. Waited 15 minutes for someone to finally come to our table and there were only 5 customers in the place. We did like the microwave garlic knots but they would be so much better made fresh. The water tasted weird so we waited 10 minutes for our waitress to come back and take our order and we asked for new water. She took another 10 minutes to bring us water and as she sat them down we could clearly see both glasses were dirty. Before she ran off we asked for the manage/owner. This guy came over and acted like we were bothering him because we wanted clean glasses. He called our server over and told her to bring clean gasses this time. How many times does she bring dirty glasses ?

Now our order. We ordered the two dinner salads and a white pizza. Our server bought to our table a calzone and what looked like chicken parm ? We said that wasn't our order and she huffed and then removed the order but as she did the chicken parm fell off the plate and on to the floor. She then acted like it was our fault. She YELLED for some guy to come pick up the mess and left us but not before she took the calzone to another table. 

A this point we got up and went to the register as we had had enough. About 45 minutes for some dirty water and microwaved knots ? We told the person at the counter we were leaving and the person just said okay.

As we got into our car (UFO) we saw our server putting our salads on our now empty table and looked around for us. She just left the salads there and went back to behind the counter. We laughed a bit and wondered why such bad service.

There are MUCH better places then this with a nice friendly staff. Also microwaved knots are not a good way to start a meal even if they are free. Guess Guy F lies on his show as this place could not be the one he was at unless they hired real staffers for that day.

NEVER AGAIN, heck Olive Garden is better."}
{"text":"We came here on recommendation and boy do we regret it. We should have saved our money. Coming from NY we are always on the look out for places to eat that remind us of home. We have been lucky to find two fantastic pizzerias that are just like back home, but this is NOT one of them. 

While service is important to us great food can beat out crappy service because anyone can have an off day, but wow, bad service AND bad food? Yep! We sat after we ordered and the garlic knots came out. No dishes were provided for them but we were ok with that. When the slices came out, still no dishes. My husband had to get up to get them from a server. 

We also ordered a calzone with pepperoni. The one spot we found that we just love makes their calzones fresh to order (AMAZINGLY DELISH) and the wait is about 25-30 min, but totally worth it. The calzone here at Sal's came out about 10 min after we sat, burnt on the outside and cold on the inside. We sent it back and within 3 min we got the same one back. Clearly it was nuked in the microwave because the dough was no longer crunchy like when we first got it and it was just as burnt and greasy. Worst calzone by far... And we won't ever be back. We will stick to the two gems we found already."}
{"text":"Entertainment book coupon is BOGO pizza which is a great deal. Free garlic knots. Pizza was good on flavor and pepper flakes were spicy. My family goes to this restaurant at least four times a month!"}
{"text":"Had the eggplant parmigiana sub tonight, one of my favorite fat splurges. Very disappointing, dry cheap bread, out of the box eggplant, and not enough sauce, although the sauce did have a fair flavor.
Service started promising, garlic knots almost as soon as we sat down, but went downhill from there. Had to ask for utensils after food arrived. Server asked how things were then walked away without waiting for an answer, leaving my dirty dishes and empty water glass behind. Waited for check that never came, finally walked up to counter to pay. And I still have a bad taste in my mouth from the not so fresh parsley sprig."}
{"text":"Sal's makes a delicious pizza pie, killer chicken wings and awesome garlic knots.   We've eaten here a few times and its always consistently good.   It's become our go-to pizza place!  My daughter drove for Uber Eats for a while and said its not uncommon to see Sal working in his kitchen, making sure things are done right.    This is the real deal.     We're big fans.   Glad you came to Gilbert Sal!"}
{"text":"Love the Sicilian pizza and the arancini. Good prices as well.
I'll be there once a week when I'm in the Gilbert area!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out on a Saturday at 5:30. Dining room was packed. Every table and bar area full with a lively atmosphere. There was a banquet room that said it was reserved. I'm sure if it would be good to use this area otherwise. There was pizza by the slice, rice balls, Sicilian, pasta dishes, garlic knots, zeppolis and I think I saw a tomato pie. I didn't have time to look for canollis. The cashier was courteous, attentive. Pizza was excellent...even after I drove it home. Everyone knows the best pizza is fresh from the oven. Then there are few pizzas that can still pass the drive home test. I grew up in Jersey -- 30 or so miles from NYC so I think I can judge! I'll go back again maybe for a dine in on a weekday."}
{"text":"Excellent garlic knots that come complimentary! Best I've ever had! The pizza was perfect thin crust and delicious. Medium wings were meaty and spicy and the Greek salad was fresh. Fast and friendly service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sal's is close to my work, so for me it's convenient. However, I do feel as though they need a little work on the staff. The owner is the ONLY one who usually greets me when I walk in and the younger staff usually seem to be angry about something. LUCKILY, their pizza and garlic knots make up for the piss poor attitudes. Their margarita and any of their specialty pizzas are delicious. If I have a large order, they usually make sure I have help taking it to my car. I love the convenience of this location but the staff needs to 'fake it 'til they make it'... SMILE."}
{"text":"Really nice place to take family for pizza. They even have one that has scattered pasta on it. I had the cheese and was great. The supreme was good but kinda strong on the licorice flavor from the sausage but that is a personal dislike. Everyone else thought it ab10. 
Loved the wings. So come o. And try this place. 
Steer clear of the rice ball. It's mushy and can be avoided. ."}
{"text":"It's by far my favorite pizza place. I eat it almost every week lol, the pizza is amazing, the garlic knots, and cannolis!"}
{"text":"Saw them on TV on Diners, Drive ins, and Dives. Couldn't get the Marsala Chicken pizza they made off my mind. While visiting Gilbert my husband and I tried it. And now that I tasted it, I still can't get it off my mind. So good! DEFINITELY going back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Great pizza especially the Sicilian style unfortunately their wings were about 3 stars. Would definitely come back :-)"}
{"text":"My mother in law from Oregon called us in Gilbert and wanted to know about some pizza joint featured on triple D.  I said wha? Where?? Sal who???
I need to investigate......so i went in for their lunch special.
I slice+6 garlic knots + bottomless soda for 6 bucks.

Let me start off by saying that Sals is a nice Pizzeria / restaurant.
Nicely decorated,inviting and very clean. It was also nice seeing real pizza men in white aprons behind the counter cooking things up. My current fave pizza joint has a college class running things.....still great pizza though!
The garlic knots are small but are covered in a delicious garlic paste and were very good with the supplied red sauce.
My slice was a standard NY style slice that was delicious. Reminded me of NY.
My only gripe is that the 2 slice / coke or 1slice 6 knot n coke lunch specials are only until 4 pm.  My pizza place adds a  topping to 2 ginormous slices for a dollar less BEFORE 5 pm and anytime after 5 for 6.50.  That is very nice !

I may have to find room in my pizza schedule for 2 favorite pizza joints!  :)

5/25/15. - went for another visit and we both had the mon/ tues pasta specials.
6.99 rigatoni with marinara & rigatoni with meat sauce 8.99
Add 2 soda and garlic knots.... 17.75 minus the tip.
Great food....great deal....good service.....nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Seriously, a lot of people claim to be New York style, but this is NY pizza!  The cheese had the right tooth, the sauce was flavorful, and crust was chewy with just the right amount of crunch.  Go pure on the toppings because this pizza does not need to be covered up.  The garlic knots were not my fave, but I think this place just stole 1st choice for pizza for us from now on."}
{"text":"This place is totally under rated!  The food is great, the place is clean and decorated nicely and the staff is friendly.  I had the Rice Ball which was amazing.  The owner stopped by to ask how everything was and mentioned that she was brought up eating these Sicilian Rice Balls.  Pizza is great too!"}
{"text":"Oh wow! Can I just say that this Family owned restaurant makes you feel like your home! The food is delicious from pasta to pizza to wings and don't forget the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Sal's and the place is very confusing.  You walk in and no one greets you, there is no sign to seat yourself or what to do.  Finally I went to the back counter and talked to some on putting pizza in the case.  Soon a lady appeared and wanted our order.  We had no time to read a menu and there were people behind us so we felt rushed.  We all had the pizza, salad and drink.
We seated ourselves.  Soon the salads came along with the wrong salad dressing.  The salad was huge pieces of lettuce, grated carrot and one olive.  BORING and hard to eat.  I finally had too cut all my lettuce.
Pizza came immediately.  All pizza was slightly warm.  I guess it came right out of the holding case.  The \"Everything\" pizza had very little on it.  Best part was the thin crust.....but sure not much toppings.
We would not go back for salad or pizza.  There are too many other great pizza places in the area.  Not sure what Guy saw in this place.  We visit lots of his places and usually agree with him, but not this time."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years. We got carry out tonight - my all time favorite is just the pepperoni but I also love the grandmas, taco pizza and the rigatoni pizza-- everything is amazing. I have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"We ordered the thin crust supreme pizza.  It lacked flavor.  We had to put several shakes of salt, garlic powder and pepper flakes on it to get any kind of flavor from the pizza.  The crust was ok in taste.  I'm giving them 3 stars because the atmosphere and service was friendly but i doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"The service could have been better but the food was good. The bruschetta wasn't all too great but the Tuscan salad with fresh mozzarella was good and the baked ziti was FANTASTIC. I will come back to this small neighborhood pizza joint again but for more PASTA!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on a Sunday for lunch. We were greeted right away upon entering, and we're told about the lunch specials. Before 4pm you order at the counter, given a number and your food is then brought out. After 4pm there is table service, FYI. Anyways, I ordered the special which included one slice, 6 garlic knots and a soda. I selected the chicken pesto pizza. I have to admit I am not a huge fan of pizza, but this slice was very good! A little greasy for my liking, but good none the less. It had big chunks of chicken, lots of gooey mozzarella and pesto sauce. The crust was perfect. The garlic knots I shared with my husband, came with a side of marinara sauce. They were alright, too doughy and not enough garlic and Parmesan cheese. 
The restaurant was clean, bright with casual decor. There is a TV so you won't miss the game or your favorite show. 
Overall, I'll say this was a good pizza experience for me and I will be back to Sal's!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day. It was busy but food still came out in a timely manner.
Lunch specials were good and I recommend the garlic knots if you like garlic. Their pizza is the thin crust type but delicious. Would go back again."}
{"text":"One bite of a Sal's meatball and you will understand ~ you will know! ~ what a delicious meatball is supposed to be. 

In the last week or two I've reviewed two Italian restaurants, both with meatballs that were disappointing or worse. One was \"Italian Butcher\", another disappointing Tomaso's restaurant, and then Venizo's, quite literally the worst meatball I've had in my adult life. 

Sal's has real flavor; I was about to say it's real quality, and I assume it is, but what I'm most impressed with and it's a constant theme in my reviews, is flavor. It has to taste good!

Pizza next time, meatballs today!"}
{"text":"Well I have been to a few Guy Fieri DDD (20+) recommendations and this is one of my top ten!

I had a delicious dinner for less then 8 bucks! That included a half order of meat ravioli, a salad (btw usually balsamic dressing has no flavor this was full of flavor!), & a order of garlic knots- which is a must no matter what you order!

The service was excellent also! I had ordered mine to go with no drink but was offered one while I waited.  The other thing I love many of the customers coming in were known by name and knew Sal- now that's loyalty !

If you ever find yourself in this area you must try this place! 

Thank you Guy for this recommendation!"}
{"text":"Have they changed their sauce?  Twice now ordered the baked ziti which used to be my favorite. Now it is just bland. Tastes like tomato sauce straight from a can. Even a little salt would be helpful. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm going to go back and I'll update the review.  I thought it was a really nice place.  The waitress was super awesome.  But ny pizza with pepsi come on that should have been my first clue that this was not ny style.  It was kind of doughy.  The bottom was crisp so I'm confused at first.  I couldn't fold my slice in half the way you are supposed to eat pizza. It was too think.  I just didn't like the overall flavor.  I will say I liked the sauce.  I also liked the garlic knots.  We ordered zucchini which I enjoyed but I just didn't love.

Walking around I saw some other really good looking options from the other tables.  The only thing that didn't look good was the calzone that had olive oil and part on top.  Again a sign of western pizza non-ny style.  

The place is busy and I see a lot of good reviews.  I was told about Sal's by a guy I know who is italian from NY who was raving about it.  But please don't call this ny pizza that is an insult to east coasters who are always on the lookout for decint pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty fantastic but there is always a long wait so plan accordingly.  Totally worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Been going here since just before Sal took it over. I'm born and raised in New York. I'm so serious about NY Italian food it's borders on being OCD. This place is amazing. It's a mile from my house. It's a dream come true for a Gilbert resident raised on family owned Italian pizzeria fare."}
{"text":"Came here expecting a gourmet pizza but ended up being average at best, crust tastes fresh but the sauce is bland. Toppings were average. Just an average pizzeria really. I'd take my money to either Grimaldi's or Casanova Bros"}
{"text":"I feel like each time I go the service goes down but dammit the food is so good. We had Julie as our server and I am not sure if she was new or overwhelmed but she was all over the place. We got our appetizer before the garlic knots because she forgot multiple times. We had to ask for refills each time I would like to stop but my bff loves the lemon pasta"}
{"text":"Wow!  I grew up 45 miles from new York city. I know what this style of pizza is supposed to taste like and Sal nailed it! As seen on diners drive ins and dives this place is legit. Slices have no cornmeal on the bottom (like 100% of authentic New York joints) and they offer white, Sicilian and even pasta topped slices. Wait times at night are to be expected so go off peak if possible. Watch the movie 'do the right thing' and thank your lucky stars we too have a true new york Sal's pizzeria to go to ;-)"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had in my life! Their is a wait but all is worth it. Great flavors, great service. Any time family or friends are in town we bring them to this fine establishment. Customer for life!"}
{"text":"After recently moving here from Chicago I was feening for a good Pizza. After trying several places (including my home town favorite Rosati's) Sal's is the best Pizza I have had since living here. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Overall good, Crust is a tad thin at top for me and they burned my crusts. Wings are good, garlic knots I can do without. They were stiff and to much of there garlic parm coating. My daughter felt same way, tried warming lightly and still same . We enjoyed the pizza and wings."}
{"text":"First time trying pizza at this restaurant and oh boy was I pleased!  The pizza was full of flavor and I definitely had no complaints  I was even more happy with my dessert. Great service sealed it for me. This is must try if you are in the mood for pizza!"}
{"text":"phenomenal pizza!!! I loved the food the wings were some of the  best I've ever had! And Kelli our server was so friendly and sweet! This place is a great hole in the wall treasure! Definitely a keeper on the speed dial too!"}
{"text":"Real deal NY style pizza. Was there yesterday with 2 x-Bronxites and 2 x Brooklynites and we all left happy. Just finished my leftovers for breakfast. We'll be back soon. Delicious"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, nice crust, tasty sauce, everything was pretty good about it. The garlic knots were also good but a little much for me personally. Closed Mondays."}
{"text":"We went for our first time a couple of weeks ago and have been back twice already and will be back again very soon.  We are hooked. Food is awesome and prepared with attention to detail. Service has been great even with as busy as it had been.  We have been fortunate enough to have Mattia as our server.  She is extremely knowledgeable and more importantly helpful and extremely pleasant. We are looking forward to working our way through the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best specialty pizzas I've had. The lasagne pizza is to die for. You will see Sal in the kitchen working like crazy. He cares about his product and customers. There are a number of fine pizza and Italian restaurants in the area, but Sal's is uniquely wonderful. Expect a crowd and don't forget the garlic knots."}
{"text":"Food was good but the waitress was rude.  We will never go back again. They were sarcastic and insulting"}
{"text":"By far the best Italian place in Gilbert. Haven't had a meal we didn't like yet. Service if great. A REAL family restaurant and atmosphere. Come here often and have never been disappointed or left not feeling full. Garlic knots are great. Antipasto salad in really good with roasted red peppers freshly grilled. My wife's favorite. Says everything is always wonderful and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. A bit crowded and busy during renovations.

Sal and the rest of his family keep the place running well and always genuinely checking to make sure patrons are happy.

Try to save room for the excellent chocolate covered cannoli and the incredible lemon cello cake."}
{"text":"Amazing! We decided to give Sal's a try after seeingbit on Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives. Boy, am I glad we did. Ordered several appetizers and several pizzas. Everything was so tasty. I didn't have a single complaint. Plus, the staff was SUPER friendly and effeicent. We will be back often. This is our new family favorite."}
{"text":"We often order pizzas, rice balls, meatballs, and garlic knots from Sals for a quick family dinner because they are delicious and affordable. I recently ordered meatballs, baked ziti, spaghetti, sausage and peppers, pizza, and a house salad from Sals catering menu for a graduation party. Everyone raved about how fantastic the food was and asked where I ordered from.  We had around twenty people there and had plenty of left overs.  Sals is a family owned business and Sal is often in the kitchen cooking up his family recipes for his guests."}
{"text":"Ever since I first visited, Sal's Gilbert Pizza has had me utterly whipped. I've got heart eyes and a belly full of love. Those garlic knots! That pizza! That pasta! Will I ever turn down an invitation to this place? I say never, barring sickness."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I recall seeing this restaurant featured on tv, which was the original reason I decided to check it out. I'm a sucker for a good pie, so I figured it was worth a shot. Our first visit was on a Friday evening,  and it was BUSY! Obviously,  that's a good sign. We were sat in a timely manner considering the amount of people there. Service was friendly and the pizza delicious! We're simple and appreciate a good cheese/ pepperoni pizza. And let me tell you, their ingredients are fresh and tasty, you can taste the quality! My daughter and I have been several times since, and have been pleased with every visit."}
{"text":"I was recommended to go to Sals Gilbert Pizza because it was seen on DDD. I will never go back.  Chicken Marsala was terrible,  Italian sub was very dry, Fettuccini Alfredo had a ton of butter. At almost 20.00 a plate, except for the sub I would have thought it would be so much better.  Parking is terrible. The side salads are a joke...Will never go back! There was enough butter in the Fettuccini Alfredo to clog all arteries!"}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews about this place we decided to try it out with a Groupon deal. The service was ok but that's about the only positive thing I could say about the place.  The pizza was terrible.  I spent 6 years on the east coast and I love NY style pizza (or just about any pizza) so I was pretty excited to try this place out after reading the previous reviews.  Unfortunately what we got was not what anyone else had described.  The toppings were sparse the sauce was just ok but the crust, oh, the crust.  I have never eaten at a pizza place with crust that bland and tasteless.  It tasted like it was made from jiffy bread mix or some sort of frozen pre-made disk of cardboard textured bread substitute.  Instead of being crunchy/chewy/delicious it was crumbly/grainy/gross.  It was so bad that I debated not finishing my piece and leaving to go to the burger place next door.  I honestly would have preferred Pizza Hut or another chain to this (not that I ever eat there, but this was that bad).  I don't know if we hit this place on a bad day or what, but everyone in our group left disappointed and still hungry. If you want pizza it's worth the drive to Vincent's or Buono's.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We accidentally discovered it nestled in the strip mall when we moved to Gilbert last year. I felt like I was walking into one of those corner deli restaurants back in Upstate New York. The staff is incredibly friendly and the owner \"Sal\" introduced himself while I waited at the bar having a Moretti Draft Beer. He's a really friendly guy and offered my wife and 7 year old some garlicky baked dough knots while we waited. What was even cooler was that he gave us a package of free home made sugary doughnuts when we left. WOW! This place rocks!

The food is fantastic and made fresh.  Our favorite is the large pizza (be sure and try their sausage) and wing combination to-go and it's an on-going special for like $20. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes you just want some different and unique kinda pizza? This place has just that and has become my go to sit down pizza place.

The hype about the Ziti Pizza is real, definitely a favorite! At first I was skeptical but the Ziti with creamy pink sauce on pizza but it is freakin awesome. I've had it both by the slice and fresh baked pie. Get it fresh since the slice has to be reheated and dries out.

Their chicken wings are pretty good too. Got a half dozen of honey medium and wasn't disappointed, would get them again.

I was happy to see they have cannolis on their dessert menu! Tasty! Might have to take some extras to go next time :)

Items tasted and rating:
Ziti pizza fresh pie - 4.5 Stars
Margherita - 4 Stars 
Ziti pizza by the slice - 3.5 Stars
Spaghetti and meatball - 3.5 Stars
White pizza - 3.5 Stars
Cheese - 3 Stars

Chicken wings - 4 Stars
Cannolis - 4 Stars"}
{"text":"Food: Very good
Favorites: Their lasagna is some of the best I've had. Garlic knots are awesome!

Atmosphere: a little loud at times, kids are frequently seen (good deals if you bring your kids).

Great little pizza and pasta joint!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good here. I can see why some people like the garlic knots and some don't. These knots are literally GARLIC knots. They are plastered in garlic so if you dont like that I would ask for them without the garlic. Luckily for me I love garlic so I wasn't complaining. Plus you can't really complain because they were free. The service here is good and the location is nice inside. They weren't very busy on a weeknight so the pizza came out quick. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"My new pizza place ! Made me feel like I was back home in New York!
Best pizza I have found , worth the drive from Maricopa . Excellent service. 
We had Stromboli, angel hair with Alfredo sauce ,and slice of white pizza and a slice of baked ziti pizza so yummy"}
{"text":"The pizza is good but let me say the service is absolutely horrible!! You'd think after you waited an hour for a table you could get some good service. The host, waiter and even owner were terrible. Horrific customer service. I was disappointed as I heard such great things about this place but will never be returning after the type of service I got! The kitchen is also disgusting!! They have German cockroaches crawling in the back!! Yuck!! Beware! Save yourself some time and money and find pizza someplace else!"}
{"text":"4 people, 2 received their order. 30 min later then wrong stuff showed up. Chicken Marsala was bad. Bad service, poor food. They couldn't care less, DDD brings in enough new people to keep them in business."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza joints in Gilbert. The pizza has that classic NY style, with lots of cheese and medium/thin on the crust. Good flavors, served hot, and some excellent little cheese garlic knots to get you started.  The service is good in the dining area, and there is also a sit down area if you just want to order at the counter and take a seat (without the full service).  I've gone here a number of times and never been disappointed. Top quality fresh food, reasonable prices, and kind people. The consistency of all these elements has this place being here forever. And its locally owned and operated, making it another fave of mine."}
{"text":"I hope I can write this review w/out drooling all over myself!  Ok, the Alfredo is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!!  The texture and creaminess is spot-on perfect and I will be craving this monthly!!!  The garlic knots are bast east good!!  Other items we thoroughly enjoyed and will be ordering again include the chicken parmasean, cheese ravioli, the meatballs, and the pizza.  

I am so glad we found this place, I've already put them as a line item in our monthly budget!!!!!  :-)   Keep up the exceptional quality and taste!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Nice family vibe and their lunch specials are good. I love the fried ravioli"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time since moving to Chandler.  It was a Friday night and it was pretty busy (but already a sign that it must be good!),  We waited about 20 minutes before being seated.  We were warmly greeted by Kelly, who was very pleasant, personable and helpful!  We really liked her!  Pizza was awesome, but as suggested by Kelly, we tried the homemade fried zucchini.  It was fabulous!  I may just return for that alone!  The garlic knots were wonderful, as well.  Invest in the wait time - it'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"Really good food and I like the remodel. HOWEVER, they need to install baby changing stations in the restrooms."}
{"text":"Really good Pizza, but Expensive. Got the Traditionalist (Extra Pepperoni, Extra Cheese $19.00) It looked like a regular pie you'd get back East. It didn't even have a normal amount of  Pepperoni let alone Extra. The waiter was Great, but when we got there nobody greeted you and no tables were available. Girl at the counter took our name after she got off the phone.... I'd get the pizza again if I was in the area......."}
{"text":"Sal's never fails to deliver quality East Coast Italian delights!  Tonight was our 4th visit and we got a regular pie, sausage/pepper/onion roll, rice ball, rigatoni slice and Sicilian slice. My Mother in Law, born and raised in NYC was in town and she said this was \"the best slice she has ever had outside of Long Island or Italy!\""}
{"text":"Our intent on a Monday for lunch was to go to the Phoencia which was closed. A party of 3 we opted for time sake to try Sal's. We were greeted and seated and told that we had to order at the front and meal would be delivered to our numbered table. The 3 of us ordered the lunch special. My friends had the 1 Slice of Cheese Pizza, 6 Garlic Knots and a Soda for $5.99.  I opted for 1/2 Sandwich (Eggplant Parm), Side House Salad and a Soda for $9.99. The garlic knots and Salad came out first, all were OK. Then the 1/2 sandwich and Pizza slices came out. My friends said the pizza was OK nothing special, my sandwich was small but it tasted OK, again nothing to write home about, a little pricey for the sandwich deal.

So the kicker is as we were looking around we realized this restaurant was featured in the Food Network, Guy Fieri, Diners, Drive-in and Dives. Wow if this is what a Food Network Chef thinks, this place is the best in Phoenix has to feature, all I can say is Hummm

Again Service was excellent, Cheese Pizza, Garlic Knots and Eggplant Parm. were very OK."}
{"text":"Felt like pizza and wings tonight. Stopped at Sal's Gilbert Pizza off Gilbert road. It had a very family friendly atmosphere. It was very quite restaurant and a neighborhood place. The owner/head cook was walking around checking on the customers. 

The service at the restaurant was great! When we first walked in all the employees had positive attitudes. Our waitress was very friendly and outgoing. The waitress continuously checked on us to make sure we were doing alright. Everyone was just filled with energy and excitement.

You can tell the food is made from scratch here. Although they have so many Italian dish options I decided to stick with the basic pizza and wings.  From the FREE garlic knots that are the best I've ever tried, to the delicious pizza. The garlic knots are amazing, and once you start eating them it is hard to stop. The wings are outstanding and crispy. The pizza is so soft and are another hint that they make their food from scratch. I definitely suggest Sal's if you are craving Italian food."}
{"text":"We ordered the white pizza, EXCELLENT!!
If I should go there again (I don't live in the AZ area) I might try one of their other pizzas, then I'd know that I can or can not order any thing on their menu!"}
{"text":"First time here. We called ahead so we didn't have to wait because of our two little ones who get out of control quick when waiting at a restaurant. I wasn't expecting when I got there that they would have reserved a booth for me and my family. They get a 5 star on customer service alone. We ordered a large thin crust pepperoni and mushroom with a small antipasto salad. The food was great. The pizza was not greasy or over powering in any one flavor. The anti pasta salad was very meaty and a good portion. Our server was also attentive and friendly.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One night around 10pm my husband decides to turn on the TV and starts watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dive with Guy Fiery! lol - Oh my goodness 'Wrong Move\" we ended up watching Guy Fiery going around Phoenix area in this series, which was kinda perfect because that's how we find good places to try out and we saw the show of \"Sal's Gilbert Pizza\" we were very enthusaed with our eyes glued to the TV as they were showcasing the \"Baked ziti pizza, Chicken Marsala, Garlic knots, and many other creative way of making some unreal pizza's\" We were so hungry but, it was so late at night and forced ourselves to sleep and couldn't wait for the next day to head on over to find \"Sal's Gilbert Pizza\" 

WOW! just simply WOW - our first visit, my husband and I shared a medium size pizza of the specialty \"Baked Ziti and Chicken Marsala\" and their just freshly made garlic knots and it was so heavenly. It was really crowded and we didn't mind sitting at the bar area and we literally enjoyed every mouth watering bites of sampling there creative specialty pizza's. We've frequent this restaurant a few times but, bringing our friends and family who does not have this where they are from and simply amazed - we needed wheel barrels to wheel us out and hit the gym the next day!

Customer service is great! They move as quickly as possible to seat everyone and if there is wait, were in no rush! We've come to indulged. 

A true gem and glad we are able to have something special here in Phoenix to share with our friends/family that is unique! 

I'm so hungry now that I wrote this review...hahahaha"}
{"text":"The best pizza n the Gilbert area!  We have tried the calzone, which was very good, but the pizza is outstanding.  The spaghetti and meatballs pizza and the taco pizza (not on the regular menu) are my husbands favorites.  Plus, they give garlic knots with marina sauce while you wait for pizza-just heavenly!  The cheese pizza is my go-to and often have more than once a week - it's that good!"}
{"text":"Guy Fiere loves it also!!
Antipasti salad and supreme pizza was excellent!!
More lemonades please!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Sal's Gilbert pizza last night and had a horrible experience. Our server brought garlic knots and sauce and cups for drinks and said the beverages are self-serve and left. The garlic knots were greasy and a little bit under done. The sauce tasted like Spaghetti-Os sauce. We ordered a pizza and wings. For the cost of pizza it was really sub par I would much rather have a Papa John's.  The hot wings were not hot. Beverages were not included in the price even though they bring the cups. We waited and waited and waited and waited to get our order taken and then we waited and waited and waited and waited for our food. After we were done eating they brought our bill and it had mistakes we had been overcharged. Save yourself a bad experience and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our family has loved this place since the day it opened. The pizza is amazing and the deep dish pizza is even better. There are a ton of creative options that can be purchased by the slice for a quick lunch or for the picky one in your party. The pasta is always perfect too. Thanks Sal!"}
{"text":"This pizza is the sleeper. It's the best I've had in the valley so far. Yeah, the service sucks but it's a pizzeria for gods sake. The pizza more than makes up for the service trust me. I have never had a bad pie there yet. I tried the desert heat last time and it is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The meat lovers pizza was amazing!! Garlic knots were so good and the Alfredo was the best I ever had!! Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on the food Network and had to try it. Pasta on the pizza was amazing, their white pizza is a definite must try and the wings were extra crispy. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a very nice family run restaurant with fabulous New York Style pizza and a wide assortment of sandwiches. I haven't tried any of their pasta dishes yet, but everything in the place smells delicious. The place is large enough to accommodate a group of 10. If you're looking for take-out, be sure to call ahead. Although the food is delicious, this isn't fast food."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Sal's since they opened. It is my East Valley go to for pizza.

Beyond the great family owned atmosphere, there is the absolutely fantastic pizza.

Thin or Sicilian, both are made with care and love that you can taste.

The grandmas reminds of being a kid again, when you could smell the homemade old school basil and gravy pie from down the street!

Thanks Sal for never letting me down."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area a few days ago, from New York!  I had remembered trying Sal's when I was out there and loving it!  Everything was great and the garlic knots were AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious! A tad pricy, but you get what you pay for. Garlic knots are really good, too. My favorite was the bruschetta pizza - SOOOO yummy!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Sals for a long time. By far the best Italian food and pizza in Arizona. Sal is a professional all the way and a master at his craft!!!"}
{"text":"\"Hands down\" probably the BEST pizza we've ever had! 
We had been wanting to try this place, but every time we drove by it was packed. That's a great indicator that this place is good.
Best to go in on the off hours between 2 & 4 or after 8 PM. 
First time in- it was after 8:30 PM on a weekend. Only had a small wait time.
Complementary garlic knots are amazing! Wings are succulent: I suggest to do them tossed in half hot wing sauce and half honey! Ordered a thin crust pizza with tomato sauce,mozzarella, pepperoni, fresh garlic and basil. It was flavorful & the crust was incredibly tasty! The best part is, you won't be needing any extra napkins. These pizzas aren't GREASY \"what so ever!\"
Just this last time we were in we had the grandma pizza. This is a very unusual one! It's a square sliced pizza and layered backwards. Meaning: the topping are on the bottom and the sauce is on the top! It's so unexpectedly perfect! This is our choice from now on! We had the mozzarella instead of the provolone. Outstanding pizza you'll have to experience, you won't be disappointed! 
BOTH experiences our servers were fantastic. BOTH times we came in the owner came out and spoke with us! Nicest, hardworking and appreciative man of his customers! You can sure see he's passionate and loves what he does! The atmosphere is warm, friendly and it's like a community family dinning in here as one! 
Added pluses- they serve beer & wine. 
The cannoli's are phenomenal, a light fluffy hint of sweet ricotta cheese filling with coca chips in a crispy shell. Dusted with the perfect amount of powder sugar.
Side salads come with dressing on the side. Love that they offer Thousand Island & their House Balsamic is super good too!"}
{"text":"Went her with family! Love the new restaurant I haven't been in for awhile! They had some specials going! Got the   and it was delicious! We will be back soon I'm sure with family ! Sal was in the back kitchen making the magic happen ! No one makes pizza like the mom and pop places !!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, otherwise just a really regular restaurant. Nothing super special and wouldn't be my first recommendation but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Just moved here to Gilbert this week. Like I always do when in a new town I go on pizza quest. We heard this place was good so we headed straight here! Without having even tasted the food , i already love this place. It was bizy, the food on the tables looked great. And the staff including the owner Sal were as friendly as you can be. Then the pizza came... I have found a home here at Sal's. So stoked"}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza from this place plenty of times. The first 3-5 times were excellent. Crispy crust with perfectly cooked cheese and toppings. The last 3 times though, not so much. If we got what we actually ordered, the crust was not crispy and the cheese and toppings was barely hot. It's  like they cooked the crust first then waited until they got an order and then applied the toppings and heated it enough to melt the cheese. The result was bottom of the barrel.....,,even for pizza. There's plenty of pizza places in the area, do yourself a favor and try them first."}
{"text":"Not awful, but not outstanding either.  My favorite part of the meal was the very large Caesar salad..it was very fresh and reasonably priced.

Our \"Desert Heat\" thin crust pizza was merely okay. I probably won't have their pizza again. I am from the east coast so the style of pizza was great, I just didn't think it tasted good.

Oh, and I don't know why everyone goes cray cray over the garlic knots. Gross...you'll be sweating garlic for WEEKS!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for awhile, ever since I saw it on diners, drive in and dives.. we ordered their baked ziti pizza and it was pretty good.. we'll defin come back to try their other pasta pizza options.."}
{"text":"First time trying sals. Great family atmosphere, environment looks clean,customer service's friendly, and food looks amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!  We eat there about 2-3 times a week!  Everything it great!!! Several specialty pizzas & the rice balls rock!"}
{"text":"In the world of competitive pizza in Gilbert Arizona there is one that stands alone, and it's not Pizza Hut. 
Sal's is definitely the best. 

Family Owned? Yup
Variety of different options? Definitely
Reasonably price? Of course. 
Quality? Look at the amount of stars I gave it people. 

They have great lunch specials, they have deep dish and thin crust pizza's. Decent sized restaurant with plenty of seating although they are high in demand so it is quite often packed. The staff is always super friendly and will always answer questions. My advice is order a big pizza and take some home with you. They have real, authentic Italian pizza's. 

Do yourself a favor. Eat here."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  I have probably eaten here 20 times.  One of my coworkers suggested we cater the office parties with their pizza.  There is no better site than 50 pizzas rolling in from these guys."}
{"text":"This was our second time eating at sals. New to the area and saw on triple D. We both like the free garlic knots. The very first time I got the ziti pizza and it was different; a little dry. The waiter was ehh as he gave us a pitcher of water and when we depleted that he never came back to fill. I also had to ask twice for my side of marina, blue cheese and bbq sauce after he brought the pizza out and said \"oh you wanted that for your pizza?\" He said this because I also had to ask him where the wings were 5 minutes after the pizza came out- we all can guess that he forgot about those as well and we stole another tables. The waitress on our second visit was on point after a Friday night wait of less that 10 mins around 7pm. We stuck to the plain cheese pizza this time and was on top of drinks and asking how things were etc. now my wife loves the pizza but I think it's nothing to rave about, although I've had much worse. All in all if you're looking to try a new pizza place they are worth a trip. You decide."}
{"text":"Always good pizza, pasta and some of my favorite garlic knots. It gets really busy on Fridays though so get here early! Lunch specials are $5.99-9.99. Sal's cannolis are fantastic also...must try."}
{"text":"I don't typically leave reviews unless a place blows me away on either the positive or negative sides of the scale. This place does not serve NY style pizza. I lived in Brooklyn/Long Island for 19 years of my life and can say that the pizza served at Sal's is not even close. Anyone leaving reviews comparing the pizza served here to pizza they had in New York, has never really had what would ever be considered \"New York Style\" pizza. The garlic knots were also really bad. There are many other places in the valley that can make good garlic knots, but again - Sal's doesn't come close. They were super doughy and the garlic was way undercooked. We had 2 orders and tossed the majority in the trash.

On the plus side - the restaurant was clean and welcoming. There's the one star ;)

I can't speak for the other dishes served here, but it's possible that the other Italian dishes are just fine based on other reviews. For anyone looking for much closer to New York style pizza though - do yourself a favor and visit Venezias or Cassanova Brothers."}
{"text":"Came back numerous times and met Sal. He cooked a pasta for us that had shrimp and capers in a white wine sauce...Spectacular."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza outside of the 5 boroughs in N.Y. The penny and vodka is amazing. Had many different pizza from there and each one has been great. My daughter loves the Sicilian and she's insanely picky."}
{"text":"If you've eaten Italian food in New York sales is definitely the place to go in Gilbert food is wonderful pizza pasta I have yet to have anything here that I didn't think was amazing I would say I've eaten here at least a dozen times in the last 15 months."}
{"text":"Really like their pizza. We ordered 11 pizzas from them recently for a party at my house and it was a big hit. Especially the lasagna pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing thin crust and scicilian crust! Best thin crust in phx. Always friendly staff. Would stand up to NY thin crust any day of the week."}
{"text":"Saw this place on DDD, and we decided to give it a try. We were definitely not disappointed when it came to the food. By far, the best pizza we have found in the valley. The antipasto salad is excellent as well. The only thing that kept me from giving a 5th star was that the dining room was super cramped... they definitely need more space, which wouldn't be a huge deal except every table that was empty was dirty, and the bussers did not seem to be too concerned about it. I saw a sign that they were looking for help, so I hope they find someone on par with their excellent food! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good, quick dinner and stumbled on this little gem. Dad wanted pizza, the kids wanted ice cream and I wanted pasta. This place had it all! And it was all delicious! Sal stopped by our table to thank us for coming in. What a nice guy!!! The servers are friendly and attentive. If you are in the mood for good, home kitchen Italian this is your place."}
{"text":"David is the best server and busser. He is always smiling and so happy to help. Very aware of his surroundings and makes sure your dining experience phenomenal!! Thank you David"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good garlic knots. Good wings. It gets busy on weekends."}
{"text":"Having just moved to AZ from NY, I'll say this pizza is ok.  Definitely not NY pizza but I knew I was not going to get that here.  The crust was decent but not the same texture and not cooked enough on the bottom.  There was a lot of cheese on the pie, more so than a NY pizza and it was not cooked long enough.  A real NY pie the cheese is browned.  There was no brown on this cheese.  I would definitely try them again and ask for a well done pie next time.
Also had garlic knots which were flavorful but also could have been a little more crispy."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal but the service the worst I've ever experience. Prepared to be  skipped over if you're not white. Never go here"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and had a very fresh Antipasto salad and a delicious Calzone.  They did not have decaf coffee or cappuccinos which was a huge disappointment.  I will definetely visit again."}
{"text":"Their menu has much to offer but my kids love coming to Sal's for the pizza.  They are particularly fond of the garlic knots."}
{"text":"Well. We are done trying them for pizza. Maybe we will go back eventually and try their actual food but the Pizza is very VERY bland. The White pizza (riccota) tasted like the least flavored pizza ive ever had."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service! Keep up the great work guys! I drove all the way from North Phoenix and didn't regret it"}
{"text":"Just moved out here about a year and a half ago from Long Island, NY, ya know where all the best pizza comes from and I have to say this place was excellent. Pizza and garlic knots..felt like I was back home. My family and I can't wait to go back. Worth the 30 minute drive. Thank you Sal for making me feel like I was back home for a little while."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years. We love the family atmosphere and the garlic rolls are out of this world! The pizza is so good, my favorite is the desert heat."}
{"text":"Great sauce,  garlic knots and cheesecake.  An all around great local Italian restaurant. Family owned and it shows. Try a glass of the house wine,  relax and enjoy the excellent service."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizzeria in the valley. They have the best garlic knots I have ever tasted in Arizona. The spot is family owned and operated and everyone is super friendly and nice.

The restaurant is always clean. The food is always fresh. They have great salads and some of the most amazing pizza options you could ask for.

They have lunch specials from open until four and they're very affordable under $10 per person. This is also a great spot to bring the entire family for dinner. They even have a separate room that can be rented out for larger parties."}
{"text":"Loved the arancini/rice ball, garlic knots, hot wings, antipasto salad, and Sicilian style supreme pizza. Packed on an early Friday night! Estimated for 20 min wait and it took less than that which was great. Huge lines for takeout and pickup. Servers and host are all in high school and were very cordial.

All that food for 4 people plus more than half a large pizza for the next few days was about $70."}
{"text":"Deliciousness!  I really felt like I was back home at this place.  Amazing pizza huge portions,  and amazing garlic knots. Wow!!  I am glad I moved up the Street from this place as I imagine I'll be a frequent visitor here."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, the service was even better and the complimentary garlic knots just tops off the entire experience. This was our first time going and we will definitely be back when we want anything Italian! Good job Sal's."}
{"text":"Yum! Love their gigantic size pizzas! They recently expanded into the next unit so there is more dining space.  Always busy, which is a good thing for their business.   Try to get there early to beat the crowds!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it is always busy and you might have to wait but well worth it. The best Alfredo in town. Lasagna to die for. Love the garlic knots and the pizza whether you eat there or take it home will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Not impressed. We went on a Wednesday night and the quote of the evening was \"we are out of that.\" We heard it nonstop from tables around us.
We ordered wings to start, antipasti salad, and a pizza. Took a while to get our food. Then Of course everything came out at one time. Then when our salad came out we were told they were out of ranch. We were surprised we weren't explained there were two different pizzas. Seemed everyone else got the thin crust as well.
Wings were good. Salad was good. Minus the lack of ranch. Pizza was just okay. I think we needed to try the thicker crust to see what everyone else raves about."}
{"text":"Sal's is great. I love all their offerings, especially their Sicilian pizza. The sauce is great, no matter what its on - pizza, pasta, stromboli, garlic knots."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to sal's for over 3 years now, and I'm so glad that i found this place! The pizza is always good. We've had the take-out and it's just as good. The food is amazing! You have to try it! My husband is a plain cheese kinda guy, and I usually miss the toppings on pizza, but not here. The cheese, crust and sauce are all so flavorful! I usually order the small house salad with ranch, and i love love love how many veggies they have on it! The place is family owned and operated, which makes it nice! They service is always quick. Even on a crowded day you can still get a table in less than 30 minutes! They recently remodeled, which makes the place look really neat, and clean! By far, this is our favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Sal's. Every time I go in they all treat you like family. The food is outstanding but the extra touch to make sure your happy is great. Try the ziti pizza, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place!! Great food...service is awesome. Family owned...just all around goodness! Please come...baked ziti pizza is to die for....Alfredo sauce is rich and creamy....calzones...there are no words!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I had a terrible first and only experience at Gilbert Pizza!!  When we first arrived, it took them close to 10 minutes to acknowledge us and take our drink orders.  Once the server approached us, she dropped off some glasses and took our food order.  No apologies or even a comment regarding the time we had to wait.  We ordered hot wings, a 16\" pizza, and  kids slice of pizza(a pretty simple order).  The wings and the kid slice of pizza came out together in a timely manner.  We ate the wings as an appetizer as we waited for our pizza. After about 40 minutes since we initially placed our order(and after we saw a couple tables that came in after we had ordered already get their food), we flagged our waitress down to follow up on the pizza,  and she said she would go and check on it.  After another ten minutes, still no pizza or waitress.  At this point I had to flag her down once again and I decided to just cancel our pizza and requested the bill; she even had the nerve to ask us if we'd like it to go(I said NO Thanks)!!  I then saw her walk back into the kitchen and discuss our order with the people in the back, and once again disappeared.  After another 5 minutes of waiting for our check, I was completely frustrated and had to get up and walk up to the cashier so that we could just pay and get out of there!  At that point, the waitress walks up and tells us not too worry about the bill and that it's been taken care of. Still no apology from the manager or at least the waitress.  I would have been content with a \"sorry, we messed up you order and we'll get it out as soon as possible.\"  Needless to say, I will not be returning to that establishment."}
{"text":"Service is good. Great food, love the garlic knots, haven't tried a slice that I didn't like. Love the pasta dishes as well.
It is a little bit crazy busy at peak times but they have expanded so hopefully that will help.    
Will definitely be back to take a seat in the new addition!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza! Great Prices and friendly Staff!  Gets quite busy at times, but it's worth the wait.  Try the gourmet pizzas."}
{"text":"OMG...I have lived in Arizona for 22 years and have never found pizza as good as this...you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Used a coupon for a free 14 inch pizza. Staff was super friendly and attentive when I picked up my to go order. Pizza was great as well! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have talked about coming in here for years and I am glad we did. Food was good wait staff was great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am a native New Yorker who no longer misses New York style Pizza and Italian food because of Sal's Gilbert Pizza!  I especially enjoy the garlic knots, salads, pasta and pizza.  I've also had the eggplant parm and am looking forward to trying the spinach ravioli.  The atmosphere, service and newly added outdoor patio seating makes this a favorite place to enjoy authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"We stopped in here because of the Yelp reviews. Yelp was right. This place is great. They sell pizza by the slice and whole pizzas. We bought a slice, well maybe two. You order then sit down and you order is brought out to you. While we were waiting for our pizza I noticed that Guy Fieri was here and did a show on Drive-ins, Diners, and Dives. How cool is that? Our pizza arrived in minutes and OMG! It was worth every cent. I got a baked ziti slice and a supreme slice. These were HUGE slices. When they arrived I wondered if I had over ordered. I wasn't sure I could finish them. Both slices were perfectly cooked. The crust was a thin and crispy, my favorite. There was adequate sauce and a moderate amount of cheese, but hey it's about the toppings right? They crammed as many toppings on those slices as possible. There is much more on the menu. I am for sure going to return and work my way through the menu on many more visits."}
{"text":"Grabbed a Sicilian slice and regular cheese slice. Sicilian wasn't the best the dough seemed a bit off. The regular slice was awesome. Garlic knots were loaded with garlic but really delicious. Nothing beats a slice from a whole pizza fresh out of the oven though."}
{"text":"It took a little time to get seated but once we were at the table the service was great and the food was better. 
The garlic knots are a must and the thin crust pizza was very good."}
{"text":"Sal's pizza is the truth. Drop the mic, we're done here. Lol, but seriously, this is the best pizza in Arizona. My husband and I hadn't even read the reviews; we were just in the area and stopped in on a whim. Whenever I see any pizza advertised as New York style pizza, I'm instantly ready to fight because 9/10 times in Arizona - they are lying. You can sell that to someone who's never been to New York but not a native New Yorker. As you can see, I'm passionate about my NY style pizza and Sal's delivered. It's SO HARD to find a place that just sells slices out here and then if you do, it's just your regular slices. I never knew how much I'd miss just being able to walk into a pizzeria and order a ziti slice but at Sal's, you can do that. Ziti slices are my all-time favorite I'm looking forward to coming back and trying a spaghetti slice or a lasagna slice because carbs are delicious, duh. Oh, and a cannoli!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my buddy in Gilbert and we decided on pizza Saturday night, but he wanted to go with his usual chain pizza joint (RT), but I had looked online for something a bit more unique and New York style.  I grew up in New Jersey with lots of fantastic Italian pizzerias and delis.  Saw the piece on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and read the reviews of Sal's.  I convince my friend to just try something new, and when we arrived it was so packed and so many people waiting outside for a seat, we decided to get it to go and head back to his place with our culinary experiment.  We got a large veggie with everything on it and a large pepperoni, pretty simple but good for comparing to other joints.
To make a long story short....the faithful RT dude now has a new go-to pizza place at Sal's.  The crust was perfectly prepared and cooked, fluffy crust around the edges with a nice crunch but doughy inside, and the bottom had a slight crisp bottom and nice chewey layer above.  The veggies were fresh and tasty, and the pepperoni was very delicious, thinly sliced, and not at all greasy.  In fact, he usually just sticks with the veggie pie but tried a piece of pepperoni and loved it.
The only comment I would make is if you prefer a bit of extra sauce, definitely order it with extra.  Our pies were great but I would have liked just a bit more sauce.  But overall it is the best I've had in years.  

Pizza where I live in Rancho Cordova, CA sucks!....I live in a pizza desert...;-( 

Lucky Gilbertians!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here about a week ago!  Garlic knots were fresh, warm and garlicky!  Yum!  The calamari was perfect -- crispy but not overcooked.  The pizza with the extra pepperoni and cheese was perfect too with a nice crispy and chewy crust.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't all that impressed. First of all, we stood waiting to be helped for quite a while. When a young waiter finally came by and helped us, we asked for a booth, then had a seat. About 15 minutes passed by before the owner and other people noticed us and started asking if we had been helped yet. Apparently, the waiter hadn't put us down for a table. We finally were given one and bad luck, right next to a second entrance that oddly opens up right into the dining area and not the lobby, giving all the seated patrons a cold gush of night air. Why this second door isn't locked is beyond me. The garlic knots I read so much about were cold and old tasting. Rather hard. Our pizza came out pretty fast - we got the meat lovers. The crust and cheese were great, however, I couldn't shake the unmistakably similar taste of either the ham or bacon (couldn't tell them apart - if there was even bacon on it) to a microwaved frozen Totino's pizza. I'm not exaggerating in the least. Service wasn't too bad although he did forget our drinks choices several times. The night ended with a birthday cannoli. One. It was ok, but again, hard and old tasting. Nobody wished us thanks or goodbye as we left, which is all the same, because I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"We've been to this place now four times since their expansion. First order was a pizza and cal-zone. Pizza was very good but cal-zone was pathetic. I ordered a build your own cal-zone with pepperoni and sausage. The zone was huge, maybe 14\" across. I found two pieces of pepperoni and a few chucks of sausage. I'd say the zone was 95% bread/cheese and 5% meat.. Second visit I had the meatball sub... Very good for the price...Great deal. Third visit I had the Italian sub. Good bread, good meats, just a little dry inside. Could of used a little more dressing... Fourth visit was well......really bad... I had the meat lasagna... It looked like spaghetti. No texture at all.... I have a photo, I wish I could post it... Wife had the shrimp diavolo. The shrimp was like rubber. We let the server know and he asked if we wanted more shrimp... What? Why would we want more shrimp that tastes like rubber. From that point on our server Joe ignored us the rest of the night. My wife ate a little of my lasagna/spaghetti and never touched the shrimp plate again. Joe never even offered to comp her meal...very poor customer service.. They just lost us.... With the new NYT deli now open 200 yards away, they better work a little harder on their pasta dishes... Sauce 2 miles south has some of the best lasagna in the east valley, The chef at Sal's should make a visit there and see how real lasagna is made..."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a Monday around noon.  We walked in and weren't greeted at the door so sat at a table for awhile waiting for a waitress and then looked above the cash register and realized that there wasn't table service until after 4pm.  I approached the cash register, feeling a little stupid, and I ordered the lunch special consisting of a slice of pepperoni pizza (pepperoni cost an additional .50cents on top of the lunch special price), six garlic knots and a soda.  The girlfriend had the special consisting of a white pizza slice, salad and a soda.  

I was a little disappointed that the pizza wasn't entirely fresh.  Pizza was taken from the display window and then placed in the oven to reheat it.  It didn't really taste bad but it just kind of turned me off somehow.  Or maybe it was the grease dripping off the end of my pizza slice as I folded it to eat.  Garlic knots were disappointing as well as I've heard so many good things about them.  My gf stated that her pizza was very good and she really enjoyed her salad though.  

The service there was a bit strange; it wasn't particularly friendly, but once you actually got someone into a conversation they weren't particularly unfriendly either.  

I'd probably go back again to try their pastas."}
{"text":"We went to Sal's in March during our annual spring training trip to Arizona. We had seen it previously on an episode of Diners, Drive-inside and Dives and decided it looked too good not to tey. We got there and had about a 15 minute wait until we could get a table which was no big deal, we've waited longer at other places. After we were seated and ordered our food we were surprised by the garlic knots that they brought to the table, they were so tasty and helped curb the hunger pangs! After waiting a little bit, our food was delivered, we had ordered a spaghetti pizza....yes I said that correctly it's the best spaghetti and meatballs I've had but on a pizza crust smothered in cheese!! I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area and want a fantastic meal. Be prepared for a little bit of a wait but it'll be worth it, I promise!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! 1. Food is always amazing. 2. They are all so sweet. I could go on and on. Hands down the best Italian place. It is busy but well worth the wait! Tonight we had the lasagna pizza it  was delish. Great jobs sals pizza."}
{"text":"I am impressed. My brother has been raving about Sal's for months now, so I knew it had to be good. It was great. Best pizza in the valley along with Slice of Sicily in Phoenix. The pizza was excellent, just like back home in New Jersey. The sauce was tasty, the cheese creamy and the crust exactly like I like it- thin crust, fold-able pizza like back home. But their Eggplant Parm was the best I have ever had in the valley. Generous portion on the bread, and for $6.99 a great value. It would be one of the best if it was back home in Jersey.

I wish I lived closer. My brother got a meatball sandwich and we each split it and the meatball was almost a good. I will be back to try one of their dinners ( though a little pricy. Hope the portions are big. If they are, I will be a happy man. We did not eat in, so I can't say anything about their service.

Kudos to whoever makes their food.  Woohoo! It really is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"The best! Great food, great atmosphere. If your from the east coast NY or NJ  you will get it as soon as you walk in the door!!!"}
{"text":"$30 for a pizza that looked liked it was baked in a nuclear holocaust. I like my fish blackened, not my chicken marsala pizza..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in East Valley and best Sicilian pizza I have ever had. I live in Dallas now but get back to Phoenix several times and year and always stop by Sal's. Love the remodeling. Place looks great."}
{"text":"Consistently good, great flavor....pizza ,wings, garlic knots, the house salad with Italian dressing allll loved by my family!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in NY...Sal's is the real deal when it comes to NY style pizza, Buffalo wings and cannolis! I have eaten here several times. Customer service is second to none as well!! I had a take out order that was placed, a mistake was made and an item was forgotten. When I called to report what had happened I got a call the next day from the owner and they made the situation right. \"We take these matters very seriously.\" I was told. Sal's is a business that gets it all! Authenticity, quality and customer service! Check sal's out! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé visited this location in attempts to get some good New York pizza since we just came back from NJ/NY a few months ago. And all I can say is we were very impressed. We got some half orders of baked ziti, pizza, side salads and it was only $20. Our waiters name was Joe, he was amazing and constantly kept checking on us and refills and helped us with the menu and choosing before we ordered. This place was simply amazing. It was so good we went back a few days later to get a whole cheese pizza. Not only will we be going back as regulars now for the amazing food, but also cause the customer service provided by Joe and everyone else. We love this place and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! But don't forget to try the garlic knots. Family-owned and operated & Sal makes you feel like family!"}
{"text":"So I didn't think I'd ever say it...but this is almost as good as being back in Jersey. Pie (pizza for you none-North Easterners) by the slice, baked ziti, and Uber eats brings it right to my door...what more could a boy ask for :)

Good family people, and while I'll admit it's not native..omg the rigatoni pizza is to die for lol 

Carbs on top of carbs, all is right in the world :)

Check out Sals, buy a slice or three...and manga manga the right way!"}
{"text":"The food at Sal's amazing. The chicken pesto pizza, lasagna pizza, and spaghetti and meatball pizza are all tasty alternatives to standard pizza fare. The side salads are generously sized and are made fresh each day. The gelato is smooth and creamy and the cannoli taste authentic. The wait staff are friendly and the service outstanding. Come early if you want a table. Prime time Friday and Saturday can result for in a wait time over an hour and still worth it."}
{"text":"I had heard very positive things of Sal's prior to it being on Triple D.  Saw the show and wanted to try it out but was a little hesitant. I've hit a couple of other places featured on Triple D and it seemed like once they were on the show they didn't have to try as hard to make good food.

Sal was outstanding. The food was great.  We ordered an app of calamari and it was probably the best I've had in a while.  Sal whatever you season the breading with keep it up it was awesome.  Got the margherita pizza and I can't say enough great things about this pizza.  The sauce was tangy which I like, lots of fresh basil and mozzarella cheese.  The crust on the bottom was crunchy and tasty.  We put fresh tomatoes on it which was a plus.  This is my new favorite place for margherita pizza.  Sal we will be back thank you for a great meal."}
{"text":"These are now the king of wings in Gilbert and surrounding area. They are beautifully cooked, crispy and juicy. The sauce is real, Buffalo wing sauce. Just the best. And remember, best NY pizza you can get here in the Valley."}
