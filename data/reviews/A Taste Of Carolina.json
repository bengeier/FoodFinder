{"text":"Service is bad. Sat for 10 minutes . When a wait staff came close , she informed me another server would be over. Yes he did to the table next to me who just sat down. I know the airport is busy. But common on. They know you are on a tight time frame. I had 1 1/2 hours between flights. Now less than an hour.  I got up and sat at bar. At least service was better. Cosmo ok. Should have stuck with a beer. Still no food. May have to get it to go."}
{"text":"Those who gave it more than three stars did so only for the beer.  I give 5 stars to the beer, 3 stars to service, and 2 stars to the food.  The food comes from California Pizza Kitchen next door.  My advice - never, ever get the Albacore Tuna Salad.  Poor quality ingredients.  The Tortilla Soup was okay.  You can get a sampler of four beers.  I did that and then chose the OMB Copper as my favorite.  Stay thirsty my friends."}
{"text":"If you have time to get to A Taste of Caroline or fly out of this terminal, they have one of the better beer selections in the Charlotte Airport.   Their selection is solid and they carry better brews then Carolina Beer Company. NoDa's Hop, Drop n Roll and Coco Loco. Yes, please!   It's still airport pricing but worth it for a better beer."}
{"text":"All food comes from California pizza kitchen..why is it called a \"taste\" of Carolina?"}
{"text":"Decent selection of locally brewed beer, including seasonals. Food is from California Pizza Kitchen, so if you want something else, plan accordingly. Not a bad stopping place if you want to try some NC beers."}
{"text":"Finally a good place to eat in CLT.  Come here for the breakfast burrito.  Stay for the Bloody Mary.  Not sure who this guy is but the service is amazing, especially considering its at the airport"}
{"text":"A Taste of Carolina shares space with California Pizza Kitchen. This worked out perfectly since my coworker and I needed to prime ourselves for arrival at our final destination. I ordered a flight of beers to whet my appetite, and was pleasantly surprised with how large the sampler was. The blonde ale went the best with my CPK pizza, although everything goes down smooth when you're thirsty.   Not bad for a pitstop!"}
{"text":"Decent selection of craft beer!  The fruit flies were an immediate indicator though....I didnt stick around too long."}
{"text":"This place would not be bad if the guy in the corner would talk quieter and was not trying to impress everyone by having a conference call yelling about how his multi-million dollar deal was gonna fail if the team does not do what he tells them.  I thought that's what the Admirals Club was for?"}
{"text":"I didn't feel like Bojangles and I wanted breakfast in the B concourse before my flight.  I got one of their breakfast paninis.  It was good, but the menu doesn't mention any sides and indeed it does not come with sides.  Just an FYI.  The sandwich (in airport pricing) is priced accordingly since I would have paid a buck or 2 more at Chilis for a breakfast burrito with breakfast potatoes."}
{"text":"So disappointed! Racing across the airport and bypassing several very interesting looking wine bars and bistro's so we could visit a taste of Carolina. Do you believe they use California Pizza Kitchen as their food menu?  There was a Carolina beer at the bar but I think that was the only thing. If you love CPK have at it!"}
{"text":"Ok so service was classic airport hub.... I am an IPA fan and had a Hop drop and roll on a layover. Mecklenburg brewery was a pleasant surprise. Good taste and body. Nice thick head on the brew as well. Nice way to take the edge of a hump day at the end of the day"}
{"text":"Dog shit. Server was rude from the first minute. I'm apparently a bother to be waited on. I order I flight of beer which was pleasantly all NC beer  I order a spin dip and it came in a plastic container as a greasy pile of dip. Totally reheated out of the Applebee's catalog. Asked for salsa or sour cream and was never given either.  Totally not worth the money.  Go eat McDonalds or something for a better meal :("}
{"text":"My experience was great here. my server, Steven, was friendly and when I told him that I was stuck between two food options he gave me an honest answer of what was tastier. Totally appreciate that after a long flight and waiting for another. Thanks Steven! I fly here every week and I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I had the chicken BBQ salad with a glass of locally brewed Porter Beer.  Of course since everyone there has a plane to catch the service is fast and the food is good."}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite and a beer in between flights. Started off my interaction with Bill when I asked about them having an IPA on draft. Bills response was \"we have a great one\" and he was right. Beer was served in a clean glass with the right amount of head.  I was, of course, pushing it for time so I was weary of ordering pizza. Asked Bill how long it would take and he said ten minutes. My pizza was served in ten minutes.  Bills demeanor was friendly, professional and he was very efficient.  I wish I could have ordered him a beer and a shot! I'll definitely stop here again next time I'm flying through Charlotte."}
{"text":"The main bartender tonight is rocking the place and they are really busy \"Auburn\" rocks  The micro brew beers here are quite good and the LCD's all Over make following your favorite spot while on there go is a nice feel. If you are here please stop in and have a cold Pint or three"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Think seventeen dollars for a.martini is a little much. Was Gray Goose, but wow. Only had a few before going back to Dallas.  If I do not make this flight, may go back for a beer."}
{"text":"Great local/regional beer selection, way below average food, even for an airport.  BBQ Chicken Salad was limp and soggy, to include the chicken.  I'd come back for a beer, maybe an appetizer but not for food."}
{"text":"This place looked promising with its nice beer list with all the local brews. It was the bar half of California pizza kitchen. Service is what did them in. The bartender was super uninterested . Took him a few to greet me and seemed ambivalent. Sold me a beer and brought it. When I inquired about if there was only this one giant size he said no there's s smaller pint size but when he's working everyone gets the large one. I had only a few minutes between flights and would have preferred the small.felt ripped off but it's an airport bar so I guess the norm."}
{"text":"We had time for one more drink during our morning layover, so we headed into A Taste of Carolina.   Service was nice and prompt, and soon I had a NoDa Coco Loco in front of me. This was a smooth porter with hints of coconut (surprise!), but it was a little too heavy of a brew to chug when it came time to head to the gate.  If you're considering Taste or Carolina Beer Company, definitely head to Taste. It's lighter, feels less like a mediocre chain and has great beer on tap."}
{"text":"Stopped in here between flights and tried some of the local beer. The bartender was very nice and the beer tasted great.  Would return if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"The food here appears to be from the neighboring California Pizza Kitchen, and it's served very quickly. I did not have much time at all between my connecting flights, but it was enough to grab a beer and a panini sandwich. Bartender was friendly and the beer list is good. I will return if I connect through Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Keep in mind this is an airport bar. California pizza kitchen is next door and they serve it here.   Drink: got a double spicy Bloody Mary. As you'd expect, none of this fresh or housemade. Not very strong either. For 14 bucks, totally not worth it.  Food: had the Santa Fe breakfast pizza on recommendation of the bartender. She said that the burrito was bland. I can't imagine how balnd as I had to douse this in chollula sauce to give it flavor. Wished there was somethin spicier. The eggs were super weird but I liked the sauce. I wanted to like it more, afterall, I have heard so much about CPK (confession: I've maybe been here once in my entire life). Pizza is usually worth all the pain gluten and dairy do to me. I can honestly say, this time, totally not worth it.   Service: service was decent. Lady was nice enough. I laughed when she carded me but not the guys who looked much younger.   TVs and music were not really jivin together but whatevs.   I've tried a few different spots in this airport; I will say I won't be trying this one again."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a beer after taking a pizza from neighboring California Pizza Kitchen.  Thankfully they had not just one but two IPAs on tap which were poured by a friendly bar tend.  We had all but 5 minutes to down it and board our flight, conveniently located right outside our gate. If you want to quickly wet your throat on the way to your next gate (assuming you know where you are going and have the time) then A Taste of Carolina delivers!"}
{"text":"My layover here at Charlotte Airport was extended by a few hours due to weather delays, so to pass the time I decided to stop at this bar/restaurant for a beverage and to watch the last bits of Monday Night Football.    A Taste of Carolina features beers from Charlotte's Old Mecklenburg Brewery. Listed on their menu are several styles and even a flight of 4 of the beers that brewery offers.  For me on this night I wasn't in the mood for beer (I didn't want to have to pee during my upcoming 2 hour flight) and also wasn't looking for a mixed drink, though this place does feature a full bar.  I settled on a glass of wine, which they offer in 6 or 9 ounce pours.  A decent 9 ounce Cabernet Sauvignon was $13/glass, and Bill, the guy behind the bar, was friendly enough on this night, though it was nearly 10:30 when I stopped here and he made no secret of the fact that they'd be calling last call soon, and closing soon after.  Pity, as it was only 10:30 and lots of people were stranded at this airport in search of food and drink due to the bad weather in Charlotte on this night. Most all the larger restaurants and better food options in the main center concourse at CLT started rejecting patrons before 10 p.m., and sending everyone to the smaller bars and restaurants like A Taste of Carolina out in the gate areas.  I was able to catch the end of Monday Night Football and finish my drink before Bill finally came through and told everyone they were shuttering the place."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Thin crust, cooked to perfection. Service was good, food was good, some tables were dirty but overall pretty good."}
{"text":"Good local beers but the food is marginal. It's just the menu from the California Pizza Kitchen. Nothing close to a 'Taste of Carolina'."}
{"text":"I really dig this spot. I don't love IPA's but love a variety of beer in a fun setting with good food. This delivers on everything. Had family in from out of town and thought this place represents a lot about what Charlotte is today. Creativity, fun, outdoors with excellent food and beer.   Sat inside with excellent service for a group. One of the specials for lunch was a Frikadellen sandwich. German meatballs in gravy on a long roll. Perfect size for lunch with crispy fries.   The pretzel appetizer with beer cheese and mustard is really good for sharing. Lots of salt will get you drinking that beer!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I came here because it was fast and close to our gates. I would come here again for the beer, but the food was not so great. the food we ordered were:  chips & artichoke deep:  was below average even for airport food.  it came out literally less than 3 mins.  I can tell it was in a package and microwaved.    club sandwich:  this was better but still was not the best.  It was a bit dry and also came out in less then 3 mins.    beer: was great good home brewed Carolina beer selections!   if your in a rush come here cause they are pretty quick!  enjoy!"}
{"text":"Garbage. They don't serve their own food anymore. It's just a bar and the food menu is from CPK and it comes on paper plates. Chips came in a 1/2 ounce Lays bag. Sandwich was so basic. Beer selection is okay and they have TVs for sports, which is the 2nd star. Avoid if you can."}
{"text":"Good beer selection - horrible pre-made salad!  Wait staff super unfriendly and was overwhelmed (covering all of the sit down side).  Only reason 3 stars is beer selection and cold glass"}
{"text":"This place might be great most of the time, but the one and only time I was here was bad enough to prompt a review. The bartender, Mandy, was constantly texting the entire time I was at the bar. She failed to greet every other guest that sat down, badgered a customer into ordering a panini instead of a cold sandwich, sloppily poured beers that dribbled everywhere, and called every male in the place \"baby\". Maybe this is acceptable at a dive bar but not when the beers are costly and there are plenty of other choices. There was another woman working at the same time who picked up the slack but she mustn't have been a manager, because she watched the bartender texting and didn't say anything.   Other reviews talk about the food, but I didn't order any because she gave me a beer and walked away.  She never asked if I wanted food at all.  Apparently it comes from the pizza place next door anyways, so it's probably subpar.   I've been in the service industry my entire adult life and this service was absolutely atrocious. It's really a shame, because the beers are incredible.  I would recommend ordering a beer and enjoying the local flavor at least."}
{"text":"There was no way I was stopping by Charlotte without trying one of their craft brew.  Having only drank wine for the past couple of months, it was a change ordering a pint of cold, delicious beer.  But as the saying goes \"When it Rome...\"  Anyways I was excited to get a taste of what Charlotte had to offer so making sure that I would be close enough to my gate for the next leg of my flight, I chose \"A Taste of Carolina.\"  What better way to get a taste of Charlotte's offering than a restaurant that claims to provide a taste of Carolina.  Having just had my fill of delicious barbecue at another establishment, I was in no mood for a bite.  I went straight for what I came for and ordered the Olde Mecklenburg Copper.  This beer, from The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery of Charlotte, is \"an authentic Dusseldorf style Altbier with a full-flavored start that transitions to a smooth, balanced finished.\"  I had no choice but to quote the description from the restaurant because there was no way I could have said it any better."}
{"text":"Located halfway down the B concourse at CLT, A Taste of Carolina has a long bar, a bunch of tables and a decent view of the large ramp area. If you'd like to look at planes while you wait away your layover here at CLT, this is the spot.  The bar has locally brewed Olde Mecklenburg Brewery beers on tap. Literally, a taste of Carolina here. Not cheap, but since when is beer at an airport cheap?  They also share the space with the California Pizza Kitchen and have CPK menus on the tables. The wait staff can help you with both sides if that's your choosing."}
