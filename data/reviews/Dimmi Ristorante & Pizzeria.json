{"text":"This restaurant is located besides Walker's Marketplace, JJ's Japanese Thai and Regal Chinese Cuisine! have heard good things about all of them so can't wait to be back in this area.  We had a voucher for this restaurant and so I took my parents and hubby there for dinner last night!  It was quiet when we arrive at 7:30pm, there was only a few tables. But the server, very nice man seated us very promptly!  The service from our really nice and somewhat funny waiter was great! He was the only one serving so we knew not to expect the quickest service, but we were there to enjoy the food so we weren't rushing.   Appetizers:  Calamari $10.25- Yummy, crisy, the sauce was a tad salty for me but everyone else enjoyed it, good to share between 4 of us  Mussels $10.20- Again enough to share among us four, very nice broth, you can taste the ingredients in it  Caesar Salad- $5.95- Smaller portion, good for 4 of us each to have a bit, was too saucy and a bit salty. The croutons were good.  Mains: Penne Alla Vodka- $16.25 YUMMY this one my mom and my favorite dish by far, just creamy yummy goodness with chicken/zucchini  Pasta Special- $16.25 Olive Oil with chicken and asparagus (my brother seemed to like it)  Four Seasons Pizza-$14.75 Warning, this one has four ingredients, but with one on each quarter of the pizza, too much olives on one slice.  Veal Parmigan- $19.25 was really good, spaghetti was not the best but the veal was great according to hubby (i didn't think it was crispy enough)   The house red and shiraz both didn't taste the best, no body.  Dessert Rocked our worlds lol   $5-6 each we had:  Tiramisu (yum) Tartofu (one of the better ones i've had) Crepe Con Mela (Apple cinnamon Crepe mmm)  Overall good place to go to and specials are definitely worth asking for =D"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very good price.   Had the Calamari, seafood pasta special, pina colata drink. They were excellent and very good.  Excellent service also. I would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"I was in town for business, wanted something fairly close to my hotel and had seen this place generally got good reviews.  I ordered a bruschetta, insalata mixta, the soup of the day (a pureed roasted vegetable), and a house red wine.  The tomatoes on the bruschetta were white to pink and flavorless and the bread of the bruschetta was drenched in olive oil- to the point of being nearly inedible.  The insalata mixta was overdressed, but maybe the best part of the meal besides the bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegrette.  The soup started out OK, but became salty and lacking flavor after about a third of the way through.  The house red wine was thin and lacking body - I can do better with a $2 bottle from Trader Joes.  The service was speedy, but the waitress didn't really do anything when I complained about the bruschetta.  Maybe I ordered the wrong things because this restaurant generally gets good reviews, but I don't think so since there were only about 6 people there when the restaurant next door is basically packed every night.  Besides, you shouldn't put something on your menu unless you think it is good."}
