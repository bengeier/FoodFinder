{"text":"I like this place, but only for a beer or two. This is not a pub where you can sit for an hour reading a book. But if you are looking to get your drink on in a very relaxed environment with an interesting mix of people then AAA is your place.

In terms of food I would recommend the chili. It is traditional, only beef and sauce. It also comes with a bowl of tortilla chip."}
{"text":"Beef burrito was excellent with black beans! Choice of hot sauces."}
{"text":"First server was rude, second was much better. Food nothing special and not hot.... Chicken and waffles were ok served with gravy and syrup, dry rub ribs decent but only get like 4-5 ribs and white wonder bread?? no sides. All in all not the greatest food for the price you pay, there are so many better options out there. Can see it as a cool place for a drink."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the ribs or the service at AAA.

IMO, the ribs were extremely dry and burned to a chewy crisp (how did that even happen?).  I also did not enjoy the coleslaw or the slice of store bought white bread served with the ribs.  The best part of the meal was the side of kraft dinner.

I would love to say that the staff were super nice and created a pleasant atmosphere, but the opposite was true.  It seemed like the staff who worked our table hated their job.

The location is nice and the building itself has lots of character, but I left hungry and disappointed about both the food and service."}
{"text":"Great stop for a drink or quick snack. Good vibe, service staff is always nice and you can't beat their $5 AAA pints and $3 tequila shots. Definitely a good spot to be a local."}
{"text":"We tried this place tonight as we were staying at the Holiday Inn, which is just around the corner. Krystal took care of us and she was awesome! She recommended the ribs, mac & cheese and onion rings and they were awesome as well. Good beer selection and atmosphere. Could imagine killing an evening watching a game with friends, to bad we had an early morning meeting. A must try!"}
{"text":"AAA is a fantastic neighbourhood bar; the nicest staff with great food. There's a certain nonchalance about the place that makes it completely unpretentious. 

They have the best nachos in Toronto by far. If they happen to have the smoked chicken wings available that night, don't deprive yourself of the pleasure. Everything else on the menu is solid. You're not going to find high refinement, but the combination of the food, staff and decor is the environmental equivalent of a big hug."}
{"text":"Came here because we heard about the $18 smoked prime rib sunday roast dinner. Did not disappoint, husband had the special which came out medium rare as requested with buttery mashed potatoes, carrots and green beans, au jus and yorkshire pudding. I would have liked garlic mashed but thats just my preference. I had the fish tacos which were delicious, added the texas pride hot sauce which was really tasty.  I did not try the bbq which they are known for but I wouldnt hesitate to come back again. Atmosphere is casual laid back spot to grab a drink and some bbq."}
{"text":"Just tried the chili tonight, my favorite dish thus far. Never had a bad meal though."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was so bad I will never go back again. The moment the server knew we were a big party he immediately gave us bad attitude. He was really stuck up and looked down on us for not having been there before. Also never came back to get our order and we made multiple attempts to get service. My friend ordered food but he forgot the order and talked back saying we didn't order that item. Also did not allow me to pay my portion of bill and ordered me to go up to the bar to pay. Overall I had a terrible experience at this place. Too bad because the food was good. If the service was half decent I would come back. If they don't like big parties then just don't accept reservations for big parties. Simple as that."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Lovely staff, good vibe, cool locals. 

Went with a group and tried the nachos, chicken and waffles, and fries (both kinds). All delicious!

Definitely will go back soon."}
{"text":"Great people, atmosphere and bar. Great selection of liquor for amazing mixed drinks and beer. The dry rub ribs are a must!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place last month on a Friday night.  I really enjoyed their pulled pork sandwich.  I love the look of the menu which was very simple and affordable.  Service was excellent although, there was only 3 of us and we don't need too much attention.  My group had a wonderful time.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food is incredible, though it's kind of weird that there aren't any sides on offer.  Only the specials seem to come with sides, and the regular menu doesn't let you order them a la carte, so if you're going to have the ribs (which I highly recommend!), all you get to balance the intense meatiness is a slice of white bread.  Like I said, weird.  

The place is decked out in reclaimed barnwood and Edison bulbs (the Toronto bar uniform), but it's still a friendly place despite the trendiness.  Service is sloooow, and good luck getting a refill if you're not drinking alcohol, but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday night around 7, jammed ourselves into a little humid booth near the kitchen where the smell of sweet tangy sauce was almost torture. Got a bourbon, two rocks. Was fully prepared to gorge myself on southern bbq, but was told the kitchen was so backed up that they weren't taking any orders!!! No orders for 90 minutes! Remember the rating I gave this place? 4 stars. Because I waited. I waited in this filament lightbulb filled place because the conversation was great, the bourbon was flowing and the smell of the sauce kept me there. 

I always think about bars like this and wonder what my rural parents out east would think if they walked into a restaurant who told them they had to wait for over an hour to order and THEN passed them a hand scribbled menu on foolscap. FOOLSCAP! God that brought back memories of when I used to write shit. On paper. 

Sorry back to the food. The pulled pork sandwich (or sandwhich as it was spelled on the foolscap) was really very good, dose it in sauce because their sauce is worth the wait. I loved the chicken on a waffle, covered in white sauce and we also had mac and cheese, which was probably made in a microwave but tasted all the better for it.
At least 4 things were sold out, which means I will have to go back and endure more bourbon and saucy goodness. Life is hard. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to this side of the east end. We had the pulled pork, the chicken with waffles, creamed corn and potato salad. All very good. The highlights being the chicken and waffles and both side. The waffles are a perfect combination of salty and sweet, soaked in maple syrup, then covered with creamy white saucy goodness. The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  
I really wanted to try the ribs, but they where out. 

I enjoyed the atmosphere, casually trendy without feeling so aware of itself. I found this made the space feel relaxing and down to earth. I will defiantly be going back."}
{"text":"Casual bar that seems quite popular by the crowd. We were lucky to get a seat. Our waiter was great, we tried the Beef Brisket and Dry Rubbed Ribs (all smoked meats), the brisket was my favourite, not sure about the wonder bread slices it was served with though. No desserts here people. I like the vibe. Would I recommend it to friends? Yes. Will I return? Most likely. They also took part in Burger Week, but the special was sold out. So AAA Bar is A Ok with me."}
{"text":"When I travel I like to find that one bar/restaurant that is comfortable and become a regular during my stay. Easily accomplished on a recent visit to Toronto. My second night back and the bartender remembered my name.  Great selection of local and regional beer, free Wi-Fi and the music selection (from the owners iPod) made me feel like I was back home in Alabama.  Don't let the menu, hand written on a small legal pad piece of paper fool you, the brisket and sides were great. The Edison lights make for a great look. It's not fancy, but it's worth your visit when in Toronto. Looking forward to a return week in February 2016 to this feel good bar. They open daily at 5PM, so unfortunately, can't grab lunch there."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after months of joking about going there for $3 tequila shots.  Once entering the bar I had to check Yelp to make sure it was okay to order food. 

On other user recommendations we ordered the dry beef ribs and nachos. Both were excellent and we were not disappointed. 

Service was attentive and drinks came quickly. It was a little noisy but to be expected for a Friday night. Great experience !"}
{"text":"This place would probably be cool for lunch but when I went on a Friday night for a friend's birthday the pub was dangerously over-crowded. You could hardly breath never mind move. It was very uncomfortable. To get a drink you have to shout at the bar tender over the tops of people's heads and kind of stretch/ toss the money. The drink is then placed in front of strangers where I can't see it (unsafe!) And then it is my problem to squeeze in and get it off the bar. The bathrooms are just gross. Nobody is attending them and there's paper and water everywhere. The space is also dangerously tight and it is easy to get smacked with the door while you're drying your hands. I know that no one likes to wait in lines but at some point a business manager has to realize that the place is at capacity and stop letting people in. The staff are friendly and didn't hesitate to replace a beer that was flat. The space, although small has a great decor. I will come back again at lunch when it is hopefully not so crowded to try the food but never again on a weekend night."}
{"text":"I'm being generous with the 3* - 2.5 is probably more accurate. Went here on Sunday night on a date (his pick! Ha!). We were both pretty psyched given the reviews but it just did not live up to our assumed expectations. 

I had the brisket and although the rub was good and portion was decent - it was dry. I doused every bite in the house BBQ sauce combined with their hot sauce (flamethrower). The side of beans tasted like they were out of a can and warmed up. #BushsBeans 

My date had the chicken & waffles. Huge portion that he said was good but the chicken was roasted, not deep fried. Isn't that sacrilegious?

The ambiance was...I'm not gonna bother. Nothing to see here folks."}
{"text":"This place is a hipster gem! Don't get me wrong I'm not a hipster and I like it, we had a couple of whiskey's and ribs and I had the southern chicken on waffle and even though I never heard of this combination before it was very tasty and the food arrived pretty fast!

We stayed and the counter because it was Friday or Thursday night I believe and every other spot was packed!

It is absolutely a must try because everybody I know love this place, we went after work so we were extremely tired and wanted to hang out a bit and just relax.

The atmosphere is energetic and the owners are friendly and nice.

It is also a few steps away from our favourite salon, Tony Shamas, so from now on every time we will get out our (me and my boyfriend) our hair appointment we will definitely come here to have a drink and try some new food.

They have a big selection of beers so there is plenty of choice even if you are a bit picky."}
{"text":"We had pretty much everything on the menu, with the exception of chicken and waffles. Here's our ranking:

1. Texas Chili
2. Brisket
3. Ribs
4. Pulled Pork

Seriously, the chili is amazing. Texas style, so no beans, no tomato, but a ridiculously rich and flavorful beef stew served with corn chips. We asked for more bread just so we could wipe the bowl clean. The brisket was on the fatty side, but that makes it tender and delicious, not dry like a lot of brisket can be. It also had a nice smokey flavor.

The food is uncomplicated, served in tupperware lined with wax paper. The sides are equally uncomplicated, but appropriate. The potato salad, coleslaw, beans and corn are fine, but any of them could have come from Loblaws. Not that that's a bad thing. It works. Some things come accompanied with Wonder Bread. Again, unpretentious, but soft white Wonder bread and brisket are made for each other.

The only bad is that you don't get a lot for your money. The food is delicious, but the lowbrow nature of the place suggest a little more \"value\". They're going for down-home Americana and I can only imagine the servings south of the border would be double what you get at AAA. Regardless, great food, good atmosphere. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Food: everything was extremely dry and mediocre. The mac and cheese was cold and tasteless, ribs overcooked, and brisket dry as cardboard. McDonalds would've been more appetizing at that moment. We ordered the nachos to share prior to ordering our mains -- microwaved nachos came last. I could make better in my microwave at home. The beef that the waitress claimed was amazing on the nachos were little crumbles of dried up beef. The only dish worth anything was the chicken and waffles. The entire party was fighting over it as it was the only palatable item.

Service: The waitress would walk briskly from the table mid-order. We could barely get half the order out and she would walk away.

I figure we must have gotten the scraps or something, as the rest of the reviews are great. I can't believe a place at this location would stay afloat for this long of everyone received this level of quality. This is one of the only reviews I've written as I've never had such a strong opinion."}
{"text":"Food was very good, but agreed.. wait time was a bit on the long side. I loved the decor and its definitely something that we welcome into the neighborhood. 
The service was much better than I expected. They split the bill without us asking, which was convenient. My friend ordered a red wine, which apparently was horrible, and the waitress said that she should have mentioned it earlier and she would have replaced it with something else. She took it off her bill, no questions asked. We were also delivered an extra pint of beer by accident, she left it with us for free. 

Not sure if we just don't eat as much, or they took into consideration the other comments, but we found the portions to be quite large. 

My husband and I had:
- Beef Brisket  (Several tender pieces of slow cooked beef brisket and 2 slices of good ol' slices of Wonderbread)
- Fried Chicken and Waffles (chicken was crispy, and waffles were sweetened with syrup.. perfect combo of sweet and savoury!!)
- we added a side of potato salad... along with 3 beers for 2 of us.. we were more than full!"}
{"text":"Would be my favourite place ever if the music wasn't so loud. 
Great food, great drinks, prices, ambience. For some reason, come 10 pm, the music gets turned up so crazy loud and it feels like a dance club. Maybe that's how they keep the whole city from coming."}
{"text":"Chill place that would make for a great hangout spot with friends. Lots of drink options and the food they have is really good. Great dry rub ribs for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's my local bar and I'm there pretty often. I love that it's kind of a cool dive. No decor to speak of, everything mismatched or old and extremely cool fun people that work there. Saloon doors in the bathrooms. It's open late and is always busy even on a weeknight. 

The only bummer is that they have one lager on tap which is pretty weak and tasteless. And the music is usually extremely loud so you end up screaming at the person next to you. But the drinks are cheap and the playlist is awesome so it's really not a bad thing :)"}
{"text":"Crazy expensive for a bird's portion of only acceptable brisket. Most filling was the accompanying plain, boring white bread. Mac and cheese was forgettable. Slow (but friendly) service. Unlikely to patronize again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Hands down one of the best BBQ restaurants in Toronto.  The waiter suggested that we try the special which he described as a rib on a prehistoric dinosaur bone and it was incredible.  Mac and cheese was delicious too. 

In summary: Outstanding food.  Friendly, attentive service.  Great cozy atmosphere.  Couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"The inside decor is rustic. They hand you the menu on a hand written piece of paper. Odd. I had the dry rub ribs and my bud had the briskette. Both were ok. Neither had any form of sauce on them but they hand you bottles of sauces which were ok. Service was good. There dishes come with nothing at all you have to add your sides. Nice beer selection. All in all it was ok but nothing special. I won't be a rush to go back."}
{"text":"Solid food and great service! Love their dry-rub ribs. It can get really noisy though so if you want to have a serious conversation you probably want to go somewhere else. 

A laid back and unpretentious bar."}
{"text":"The best little spot in the St. Lawrence neighborhood. The staff, atmosphere, vibe, food (yummy nachos) and location are all great. Can't complain about $3 tequila shots either. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Texas-styled BBQ joint on Adelaide and Church. 

I went there with a few guys and we got to sample most of their simple menu. We got the chili, dry ribs and chicken & waffles. 

Food - was overall pretty good but the portions were way too small. Note that all the mains were around $14 and they don't come with sides 
Service - the wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. However, the food took way too long and really took away from the ambience 
Rating - 2 stars because even though the food was good it wasn't anything special, the price, the small portions and the wait"}
{"text":"This place has very good beer, good food, and a great, fun vibe.  It is slow as others have complained.  We didn't order the sides, except for fries, which were good."}
{"text":"The ribs and chili were so fucking good. First rib lead to a single tear of solemn joy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great. It's a dive bar, but much cleaner. And without the fear of a guy breaking a bottle over your head. But after that don't expect to be wowed by the service or the food - Service was slow and portions size not reflective of their cost. And I don't buy being busy as an excuse for a restaurant (which was their line.) To their credit, though, they did their best to make up for it all with a shot of bourbon and I was able to try a few beers I hadn't before. I'd definitely go back, but with my expectations set a little lower."}
{"text":"Got chicken & waffles for takeout, and it was decent! Atop the waffle was were pieces of a crispy-skinned, moist and tender, drum and thigh.  There were large containers of syrup and gravy on the side which had a generous portions of the condiments, which I totally appreciated.  Not sure what the experience is like actually dining inside the restaurant, but I wouldn't mind picking up a meal or two when I happen to be in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Ribs were smokey and OK but eating in noisy darkness isn't so great. For a bar, the food was good but don't come for the food... come if you want a loud busy bar."}
{"text":"We stopped by AAA Bar for a Tuesday date night, and unfortunately, it didn't live up to our expectations.

THE GOOD:
- $5 pints on Tuesdays - can't say no to that. 
- We tried the dry ribs after reading the positive reviews. They were pretty damn good indeed - the highlight of our visit. 

THE BAD:
- Service was...sloppy. I'm not sure how else to put it. For one, they completely forgot about one of the items we ordered (mac 'n cheese) and we had to call someone over to order it again. They also added a $14 item we never ordered to our bill (chicken and waffles). It was nearly impossible to flag someone down to correct these errors. 
- Mac 'n cheese reminded me of Kraft Dinner Deluxe, with the ready-made cheese sauce. Save your money - you can get a full box at the grocery store for $4. 
- Nachos were just average at best. They are listed on the menu as \"nachos with beef\", but I really had to hunt for that beef. I would recommend ordering them with no lettuce.

Overall, I think we went wrong in expecting great food and A+ service from a pub. It's not a bad spot for a drink if you're in the neighbourhood, but if you're hungry, I'd pass."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because these were the most unique ribs I've ever had.

   ---   ---   ---

I don't even really know how to describe them. They were small in length, but quite girthy. They had an incredibly unique flavor/texture to them. Maybe Canada has some wildlife that they keep a secret from us... that, or AAA Bar has a gastronomic genius smokin' up ribs in the back.

Speaking of unique, see the photos of the mac and cheese. It looks like Kraft Mac with cheese grated on top, but it was delicious.

I heavily debated where I was going to eat dinner right off the plane as I arrived in Toronto, and I'm happy to say I picked a winner!"}
{"text":"Why don't they have wings every night? I would move there. I would become one of the hobos in the park just to be near them at all times. I would leave my job, apartment and family to be with them.

So yeah...the wings are good."}
{"text":"Came by Thursday evenings with a few friends to grab a beer and a bite. There were 5 of us and we sat at the bar. Waitress came to greet us right away and we ordered our drinks. I got the Goose Island which was perfect because it wasn't hoppy at all and went down smoothly. Their selection of beer was very small and they didn't have any beer on nitro.

I got the chicken and waffle which I really enjoyed and they gave us 4 different hot sauce to go with our meal (thank you) and he got the beef brisket - it was good but it was literally a few slices of cold beef brisket and two slices of white bread on the side. It looked like cafeteria lunch - not so appealing.

I would come back to try their nachos because I saw someone else eat them and they looked delicious."}
{"text":"Solid bar, solid food. 

Ordered the dry rubbed ribs and chicken wings.  Wings were great, but the ribs that was perfection. They were the best I've had in a while. Delicious, and true to good BBQ. 

Good beer selection, good mixed drinks, and friendly staff. What more could you ask for? 

Give it a shot."}
{"text":"No way.

The pulled pork was dry.

The smoked beef brisket was bland, small-portioned, and came unappetizingly with two simple slices of boring white bread (for $15!).

The service was slow and uninterested.

So many better dining choices in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This a great bar to grab a drink after work. Around 9 though service and atmosphere/crown gets mixed. Its a too loud to really talk, yet to boring to not talk. Lay out is a bit cramped.

Food is ok. Not the greatest though. They seem to like to promote themselves as the best at things. 

Beer tap quality is low."}
{"text":"Outstanding food AND service! Dry rub ribs were incredible. My friend says that the sausage was outstanding also. Very good Mac and cheese. Great place to go if you're looking for a great meal and a fun time!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!! If you want food!! 
Late last night we were hungry for some chicken and waffles, sadly our regular joint was closed  so we googled \"chicken and waffles Toronto\" and found a blog- top10 places for chicken and waffles in Toronto...and low and behold we found Triple A Bar and they're so close to our home  
We ordered 2 chicken and waffles and a side of Mac and cheese all to go. We got home and started eating right away, the waffles were dense but not too bad, the maple syrup was watered down-or of low quality,  the breading on the chicken had awesome flavour BUT the chicken had a funny taste! I smelled it right away and it was BAD!! I only ate one bite, my friend was so hungry she ate one drumstick then said \"this is just not right, it has an off taste\" 
Needless to say the chicken ended up in my compost....what a waste of money! 
Moving on to the Mac and cheese, how can you screw up that? Well apparently AAA can!! I think they put liquid smoke on the Mac and cheese...but why?? It had such an overpowering smoky smell, if it was just smoked cheese it wouldn't be so pungent. We couldn't even take a bite, it smells so BAD!! We put it in our fridge thinking maybe we'll try it today...but now I know that too will become compost (let's hope it doesn't kill whatever agricultire it will fertilize) 
Now we are both sick to our stomach, we've been having diarrhea and feeling like $H/T since very early this morning  
I wish I would have repacked this disaster and returned it for a refund, but again as I said it was late and I was just exhausted....and now sick
Please DO NOT EAT HERE unless you want to get sick"}
{"text":"If possible avoid this place! The ideas of it seem great!!! But the service and food was below standard. They forgot something we ordered and served us dry pulled in pork. When we asked for sauce, it tasted spoiled and they waitress asked how it tasted and I said sour in not a good way. She didn't offer to bring us any other sauces. 

They also forgot to bring our bill cleared the table and left us waiting for 15-20 minutes for the bill. We finally got up to pay at the bar and they just said have a good night. Should have Ran then! But the honest people we are we said what is it free and asked for the bill."}
{"text":"Good ribs, good nachos (if you believe there is such a thing). Good service. Good beer.  Pleasant staff.  Worth a stop.  Very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Literally too many great things to say about this place. The brussell sprouts are incredible, the brisket poutine was my father's ideal meal, etc. I'll just string through a list of my favourite bartenders.

Robin, the sweetest and the most attentive server I've ever met. Great to have conversation with, always very aware of what's happening in her bar-- we never had to wave her over! She always walked by before we hit the bottom of a glass.

Adam, charming, funny, easygoing. Keeps the bar conversational, the ultimate karaoke MC. Remembers what we drink whenever we come in.

Diego, damn that boy can mix a drink.

Lorenzo, you're the sweetest. Honestly of i brought someone to this bar for the first time i would hope Lorenzo was on because hes so nice."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of AAA is awesome, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything more than grabbing a beer and sitting at the bar. The food is interesting but overpriced, the bartenders trend to butcher cocktails, and the food service is really slow even on quiet nights."}
{"text":"I'm really struggling with this review. The food is good but the wait time for the food was brutal.The restaurant focuses on a few things - a) Texas style BBQ, b) beer, c) tequila and d) Bourbons. I read a good review in Toronto Life magazine last week so thought I would try it.  Food is between $10 - $15 per plate and average alcohol prices. It should be noted Triple has been opened for just a week, so some growing pains are expected. I arrived in a party of 6 and was promptly guided to a nice corner spot in the bar / restaurant. 

First the good:

- Friendly staff and friendly service (excluding wait time for food - see not so good below).

- The Texas style BBQ is very good. If your not well versed in BBQ, Texas style applies a dry rub to the meet. There is no dipping sauce with this style.

- The menu only has 5 items which is good - focus on a few items and do them well. (The menu is a just a \"sticky note\" with hand written items????). The menu consists of: 

1) Beef Brisket - I had this and it was good but the portion was small.
2) Ribs - A few friends had this and the portion was bigger and it was very good
3) Texas Chili - no one tried this during my visit
4) Chicken and waffles - The waffle was home made and the chicken crispy on the outside and moist white meat on the inside - good stuff
5) Pulled Pork sandwich - no one tried it

You add sides for $3 each and include the following options: Cream Corn (From a can), Beans (from a can), potato salad (very good and home made) and cole slaw (didn't try it but my friends liked it).

- Good selection of tequila and Bourbons

- 5 beers on tap - Creemore, Steam whistle, a boring light beer and two other micro brews which I can't recall.

- The restaurant looks great. It's all exposed brick walls and nice wooden tables.

- The drink service is fast and efficient. 

And the not so good:

- From the time we ordered to the time the food arrived at the table, it was at least a 60 - 70 minute wait. I have no idea why it would take this long. The waitress apologized up front and said the kitchen was behind. Since the restaurant is brand new, I will forgive this once but would expect a dramatic improvement on my next visit (some of my friends were not as forgiving). 

- The beef brisket portion is too small. At $15, you get about 5 pieces and two slices of wonder bread. I left hungry.

- The side dishes should be made fresh - the beans and corn tasted like they opened a can from the super market. 

At the end of the day, I like Triple A, the staff, and the Texas BBQ but the wait time for food is really unacceptable. This would be a 4 star review if not for the wait time. I will definitely give Triple A another try but expect the food service to improve significantly!"}
{"text":"I won't go back. 

Me and six others went on a Sunday night - the place was only about half-full. We ordered two pitchers and three shots, then later on in the night had a round of $3 tequila shots for the table. 

About an hour later, we tried to order another round of shots and were told that they couldn't serve us any more alcohol. Huh? 

We weren't being rowdy and the bar was going to stay open for at least another hour, so why did we get cut off? We were all confused. 

I didn't try any of the food, but I'm from Texas and they were missing every single quintessential \"Texas\" beer staple, too. I guess they just serve \"texas-style bbq\"."}
{"text":"Best ribs in the city, without question.

AAA is a really interesting place because when it's quiet (when they open on Sundays for example) it is one of the more peaceful places in the city- we have gone many times to unwind after a busy weekend over fantastic food and drink. Whereas other times it can be the most happening place!

The food is Texas-style right down to the Wonder bread that comes with the meat. The ribs are a real standout here with a fantastic dry rub and dry ends but succulent middle. The time they had a full rack special were the best ribs of my life, served here or down South! The sides aren't really standouts, though the mac & cheese is stellar, and the coleslaw is good. The baked beans are a bit mediocre.

We enjoy the quirky servers who always make you feel welcome. Decor is great with wood or dark brick on every surface. Its location is a bit odd, but makes for a nice walk when we go. Since it's just outside the financial district it can get busy after work but will then have relatively dead spells, before being filled again later. On weekends it even becomes a happening bar late in the eve."}
{"text":"The good:
Service was good.  Very \"local\" and \"neighbourhood\" feel.  I didn't have any food so I can't speak to that, but I had a whiskey sour, and it was yummy and came very quickly.

The bad:
The place was crazy full, loud, crammed on a Thursday night.  This CAN be okay but it meant we sat at the window stools.  Which means that the freezing cold draft from the window (which are clearly not sealed up properly) kept me unable from ever warming up from outside.  They really need to either not seat people in those seats, or get a little heater, or fix the window.

Also, the crowd was awful.  It's not really my part of town to begin with, but it was all the after-work crowd and they were douchey and unappetizing in every way possible.  Literally I said out loud, \"I am so glad I am not single anymore.\"

But the real reason for the 2-star review were the DEPLORABLE bathroom.  It was like a nightclub on Richmond circa 2003.  There are two stalls, with swinging doors.  One had no lock and so you couldn't close the door and the stall door would just swing open.  The one that did shut left an over two inch (THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLIC) slit in the middle so that everyone else can just see right through, to the point that there was NO need to even pretend to have a door.  It was appalling and disturbing."}
{"text":"I visited this Southern style bbq joint on a Friday night with a few friends. The atmosphere is loud and boisterous - I'm told it was quieter than normal due to the long weekend. It's a causal dining venue with good southern style food. We tried a few items - the ribs, fried chicken & waffles, wings, beef nachos, Mac & cheese, and coleslaw.  My fav would be the chicken wings, the ribs and the nachos (perfect cheese to chip ratio, need I say more?). They also had $5 pints of beer so how can you go wrong. 
The place is very loud so if you're looking for a quiet night or going on a date it may not be the best place for you."}
{"text":"I really hate to write this review, but as I review everywhere I go, I will. I also hate panning neighbourhood spots, because I am a huge supporter of \"eat local\". However, this meal was truly a disaster from start to finish on every level. First, it has been open a year and a half, so kinks should be well ironed-out by now. Besides, this is their 3rd restaurant in the east end. There were only two staff waiting tables at 5:00 when it opened. We came for an early dinner with one of our sons who is 22. Second, this is a family neighbourhood, and my 5 sons were little once, too, and we used to go out early, too, but this place was out of control. The place filled fast with young families....fine....but for whatever reason, it seems to be accepted that kids can run throughout the restaurant from end to end, past patrons without kids, and that's OK. I don't know about anyone else, but I sure never let my young kids run around a restaurant :P So combination of parental bad judgement and no restaurant intervention? The next issue. When we arrived we were the first and only patrons. We ordered drinks - 2 Old Fashioneds and a beer on tap. The beer on tap took a good 10 minutes to arrive, and I could see our Old Fashioneds sitting poured on the counter. Just sitting. Apparently they had no bitters and no simple syrup (really?), so ran around frantically, eventually to a bar next door. Worst thing? They served us the Old Fashioneds that had been sitting on the counter the whole time, with much of the ice melted by the time we received them (about 20 minutes after arriving), and they were diluted and awful. At this point our orders had long since been placed, and the three of us kept hoping the food would be better than our experience so far. The food took 50 minutes to arrive at the table, even though our orders were handed to the kitchen first, and with no other patrons present. WHAAAAATTT? Still hoping for good food, as we were really hungry by that point, we were all let down. My son's nachos were horribly average at twice the price of those found in any cheesy pub. My husband's ribs were just barely OK. My brisket, their \"specialty\" according to them, was fatty on the top and dry as a bone halfway and down. And relatively flavourless, so I am wondering about how much smoking it got. There are 4-5 other smokehouses not far from my house, and this was, most unfortunately, the worst. You order sides separately. The fries were fries, and the coleslaw was good. We all had food leftover, just because we could not eat it, not because we were stuffed, and none of us wanted a doggie bag. Honestly, if you read my other reviews, you will see I am rarely this unhappy. To top it all off, we did not have knives, and one of the wet naps was unopened, but greasy on the bottom, so had clearly been served before. Yuk. I always SO want to love my neighbourhood spots, but this one was a trainwreck tonight, and sadly, we won't return."}
{"text":"A cool spot.  Atmosphere is very casual, which I like - you pretty much seat yourself.  Servers are friendly and relaxed.  You certainly get a southern feel with the mostly wooden decor and cowboy hat hanging on the wall.

We had the ribs, nachos, coleslaw, and brisket poutine (special).  The ribs are excellent.  The seasoning they use on it is smokey and subdued and they provide BBQ sauce (not sure if it's in-house made) if it's not enough taste for you.  The meat is cooked well and comes off the bone easily.  The nachos here are a gem, and likely overlooked.  The toppings were fresh and generous and it was not overly salty.  We liked them so much that we ordered two of them.  Coleslaw is all purple cabbage and a bit on the tart side for me.  The brisket poutine was delicious, but salty.

A note: If you're looking for wine, they do not have much of a selection.  Also, they had no house cocktail list, which surprised me given the southern theme.  I was expecting some bourbon inspired cocktails, but was fine with beer.

Right up on par with electric mud and carbon.  Get the ribs.  I'd definitely return here for an after-work drink and a bite."}
{"text":"This place has the best ribs I've had in a public restaurant ever!  The menu is quite simple. Don't expect to be overwhelmed with an expansive menu that you would get in a typical franchise. You actually get a hand written sheet with a handful of entrés. All sides are served as an extra. I have to say it is still an excellent value for the dollar.  Anyone in the area looking for a great restaurant to have a  bbq'ed meal, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I really liked this bar.  It was comfortable and not pretentious.  I enjoyed the decor tremendously.  From the wood and stainless steel and exposed brick and light bulbs.  I did not get to eat because I'd already had dinner but the food look and smelled amazing.  I will be back to try it for sure.  

The drinks were great!  They weren't too expensive, either.  It was my friend's birthday and they assisted by providing plates and a knife to cut the cake.  A really great atmosphere.  I cannot wait to get back to try the food!"}
{"text":"I live very close to this bar. I checked it out because I love bbq food, not so much for the drinks. So my review is only valid for food and not the drinks.

First the food took forever to come. Second the quantity of the food was very little. Third, the foods don't come with any sides .... what sandwich that cost $15 doesn't come with fries or a sides. Fourth, the bill took forever to come and then took me another 20 minutes to pay.

Ordered the  two different sandwiches and one chicken and waffle. Worst experience ever. The brisket sandwich was a few pieces of brisket with two pieces of white bread on the side. What restaurant gives pieces of just bread !? It was blaspheme to me.

The food is priced between $12 to $15 but it isn't worth anything near it . Worst experience at a bbq place ever for me."}
{"text":"As a BBQ fanatic, I can tell you that the meats here (we tried ribs and brisket) are done very well. It's not easy to find that in the southern US, let alone Canada. There is no atmosphere or hostess, but that isn't really the point. Just enjoy the meat (and cool hot sauces). We will be back the next time we visit Toronto."}
{"text":"AAA Bar provides AMAZING ambiance.  It is super comfortable, yet hip and refined.  The beautiful wood finishes on creatively crafted tables, and on the centrally located bar compliment the artfully exposed brick interior and really give this small space some polish.

This is the type of spot where you go for the proverbial \"one\" drink after work and quite possibly end up calling in \"sick\" in the morning.  The staff are friendly and quietly efficient and the Ceasers are spicy without being ostentatiously so.

I do have a few beefs with AAA, no pun intended woh woh.  If AAA really wants to kick it up a notch to quote the great Emeril, they need to do a few things.

1. Open for lunch!
2. Expand the menu!  What they do do, they do well, really well.  ( now there's a mouthful).  However they need to encorporate a few staples into their menu, such as the common french-fry, and maybe even get some smoked wings.

At present I give AAA Bar a solid 3 star, it would in fact be a 3.5, if Yelp had the .5 rating, but I can't justify a 4 quite yet.  I will be back.  To be continued."}
{"text":"I had the brisket and a side of slaw. The brisket was good but not consistent. Some slices melted in your mouth, some were dry. The slaw was OK. They had a good selection of hot sauces though which actually made everything taste better. I'd go back. Good bar to meet with friends and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Got the ribs and the beef brisket sandwich which are $15 each, plus a side of Mac n' Cheese for $6. The ribs were deliciously juicy, smokey, and absolutely great. It really didn't need to come with that one slice of dry (dry!!! why?!) wonderbread. Beef brisket sandwich was about 5 slices and came laid out on white wonderbread again... The two pieces of bread for the briskets were separate and I guess meant to be assembled by yours truly. Briskets were really dry, and really disappointing. The bread was also dry. Just a depressing dish altogether. 

Two pints of local beer and $55 later (not including tips) we left unsatisfied. The 1 star was for the ribs and ribs only. (Service was not especially friendly, It is fairly loud in there, wouldn't say it's good value.)

Oh I forgot to mention the Mac n cheese. It was forgettable."}
{"text":"Do you like small food portions? 
Do you like 10 dollar \"sausage\" in a hot dog bun that's not even toasted?
Do you like cold beef? 

If your answer is yes then this is the place for you!!!
If your answer is NO, save your time and money go to a street meat stand and don't step foot in the place. (Seriously that's what we ended up doing after a 60 dollar bill for 2 people) lol gtfo of this place)

Honestly the one star I gave seems a bit too much."}
{"text":"This place was spot on for date night!

This smoke house / bar does a very small menu but do it very well. We both had dry rub ribs which were authentic smoked ribs with plenty of meat so no one was going home hungry. The meat has a taste which I've never had before but very tasty - must be cedar smoke? Sides are very basic - corn, beans, onion rings or fries but that adds to the character of the place.

They have a really good local beer and I asked for a recommendation for bourbon for desert and was extremely surprised at how good bourbon compliments smoked meat! Buffalo trace - awesome!

The service is very casual but very friendly which adds to the charm. There's no reservations so is get there early to avoid the rush as it does get full later.

I would say that you get there early before the favorite dishes sell out and hunker in for a couple beers/bourbons afterwards. Good times!

Definitely going back to try some more bourbon afterwards!"}
{"text":"Great dive bar with good bbq food.
Food: had Mac and cheese (5/5), coleslaw (3/5) was a bit too much vinegar for my liking, chicken and waffles (4/5) and brisket (4/5). 
Service: wonderful service, really laid back and friendly staff. They have $3 tequila shots and the server was very honest in warning us it tastes awful lol."}
{"text":"I came here before a Yelp Elite event just to grab some grub and pre-drink with some fellow Elites.  

What I like:
a) The name.  I almost thought it was called \"AA\" Bar.  
b) Handwritten menu
c) Their hot sauce! OMG! This was freaking killer but tasted so good
d) Friendly service
e) Beef brisket was nice

What I didn't like:
a) i thought the beef brisket was kind of pricey at $14 or $15 and it was served on white bread instead of whole wheat or some type of pannini.  It would have been nice if they put some of the \"jus\" on top of the bread too.

Overall, not a bad place to hang out and grab a drink.  Food is okay."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for drinks and some food. The bar has a rustic vibe. When we sat down, we got menus from the waitress which were handwritten (very hipster). In terms of food menu options, they don't have too much on there. Our group ordered the dry rub ribs and the chicken and waffles. 

The dry rub ribs were relatively tender. They do give you three different hot sauces try with the three horned goat being the spiciest. Overall, I wasn't too impressed or disappointed. It's definitely not enough of a quantity to fill you up. 
My friends found the chicken and waffle to be pretty solid. It definitely tastes better than it looks.  

This place has really cheap drinks  ($5 for a pint of Amsterdam blonde on a Friday?!). Sign me up. Overall, would return for drinks after eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"My Favorite bar in Toronto. And So Perfect bar in the World! So Good Employment! Perfect Location! And Perfect price. I love AAA bar!        .         .      .      ."}
{"text":"If you're in Toronto and looking for decent BBQ then this place OK for a good meal. Recently visited nd enjoyed some great meaty ribs with a fantastic beer. The beer was cold but so was the bartenders personality. Cheer up aand smile a little!"}
{"text":"Worked late so called ahead and got some takeout ribs & cole slaw.  Their (excellent) brisket was sold out but for some reason is not available for takeout.
The dry rub ribs were a reasonable (for Toronto) $15 for a satisfying, very meaty half rack of 5.  Charred on the outside but a little pink internally and didn't quite fall off the bone. Really liked the sauce on the side - not too tomato based but had a little tang, almost Carolina style even though they are stated to be in the Texas BBQ vein.  Accompanied by a slice of thick white bread which may be authentic but hardly essential.
My side creamy cole slaw was underwhelming - little commercial tasting and a smallish portion for $4.  Don't get that (not only here but other BBQ joints as well) as its mostly cabbage which is about as cheap a food as there is. Regret not trying the spicy cole slaw - maybe next time when I sit inside for the brisket and a shot of bourbon or two. 

Pretty rockin bar too - not big on decor but have drink specials & the games on their TVs.  Is generally fairly full with a pretty friendly clientele. A very good choice to kill a couple hours in my neighborhood of 17 yrs which for me otherwise lacks good, well priced, non pretentious watering holes."}
{"text":"I give it a 5-star for a bbq style restaurant... on par with Electric Mud, maybe better.  

What a great little place... Food was delicious!  We had the mac and cheese, the waffle and chicken, and the fish tacos.  All of them were very good... comfort food at it's best. 

Service was great - all the staff were very nice and friendly.  

The place has a great vibe to it.  Was very busy.  It's rustic wooden tables and affable staff make the place one of the least pretentious places around.  I would definitely go here again and would happily recommend this place to anybody I know."}
{"text":"This place is a nice fit to the area and a cool spot for a beer. 

I like their dry rub ribs but I have yet to have anything else I liked on the short menu. Stick with the ribs and a beer a you're all good."}
{"text":"I've been a few times for drinks. I like the vibe, nice change of pace in the downtown core to have something more laid-back and a bit divey. Service was great- people came by whenever we were close to finishing our drinks, and were very friendly. I haven't had food there, but I love BBQ so I will have to try it out sometime. It seems to be pretty popular for after work drinks and has a fun vibe. Definitely a lot of late-20s/early 30s dudes hang out there, which isn't good or bad just something I noticed. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Dim, lively, loud, and lovely. Even mid-week, the place is pretty full. Just what I need for a couple pints with friends to shoot some chat and laughs. Haven't tried the food but it doesn't matter. Getting my beer fix, and for the perfect price."}
{"text":"I Lived in the south for a while and this is the real thing. I have reviewed this place  on a couple of other pages and summed it up this way..

The dry ribs are so good I didnt want to brush my teeth for fear of the taste no longer Lingering.

Aaa has become our new goto spot."}
{"text":"Sad to see a concept fail. Obviously my opinions are different than a lot of the other reviewers, but I felt ripped off from the moment approaching the restaurant. A sandwich board out front promises entertainment tonite! Inside their is NO room for an entertainer, ask the server who and where the entertainent is. Answer: He is the entertainment! Perhaps, but a very low set bar. Diet Coke is actually Dr. Pepper, thankfully the water is real. When cabbage is expensive due to the season, don't sell me 2 cups of cabbage core sliced with a
machete and call it cole slaw! My ribs had been dead for a long time and the short turn in the microwave did nothing to add to the ambience or taste. At l;east get it above room temperature. Reading elsewhere about the owners of this establishment reads like a rod trip thru waay too many restaurants, many now just tired memories.
Half way thru eating tjhis hunk o meat, I survey the room and it dawns on me, we are some of th efew actually eating food, the rest of the patrons are drowing their appetites in little glasses of rd wine and I assume techila."}
{"text":"Came here as Part 2 of our bar-hop night.
I've passed this place so many time, only to wish I could try it out. Finally! my objective paid off.  AAA Bar has a dark, yet cozy, funky, dive bar-feeling.....which I actually liked.  It has a local-feel. 
It's so chilled out, non-pretentious and this place has character. Their menus are slips of note pad paper and their service is decent! 

The food from what I've seen is hands-down good! especially their BBQ.
With a glass of house beer, we ordered their plate of nachos, which you can't go wrong with.  Their prices are reasonable and portions are huge which makes this place a hidden gem that's away from the hustle and bustle of the entertainment district. 

I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS food. I love that the menus are on paper and just the simplicity of it all. Great ambiance, comfortable feel and great servers. 

The Mac and Cheese is to DIE for. I don't know what they put in it but damn was it good. I also had the chili that was spicy - just how I like itttt. 

They also had this new beer on tap (which I can't remember what it was called) - but it had a banana after taste to it. Not really a beer drinker, but after I heard banana, I was sold. So light and crisp, it was a perfect pair with the chili!

Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"3.5  

I've been here a handful of times, both for dinner and private events.  

The food is delicious.  I've enjoyed everything I have eaten including ribs, chicken wings, burrito, mac and cheese, brisket and my favourite, the nachos!  I don't really like the plain piece of white bread with the ribs.  It would be nice to have something else.  The prices are a bit high, but not too high that I wouldn't come back.

It can be a bit loud a times.  

The staff is really friendly, especially the owner.  It seems like everyone who works there loves it, so that's always good to see.  On occasion I find that the service can be a bit slow."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service!  The staff are some of the most friendly in Toronto.

They also have cheap tequila everyday and great beers on tap.  A good place to go with friends for a few drinks and nachos."}
{"text":"My local watering hole with a grungy vibe. Easy atmosphere, good service, approachable laid back staff."}
{"text":"Holy hell, this place is awesome.

I think this is the best and most authentic BBQ I've experienced in Toronto. We created a \"tasting menu\" of sorts to try a bunch of the house favourites last night at the close of a long and awesome meeting. The food was excellent. Being a driver, I didn't sample their offerings of beer and whiskey but the place got rave reviews from the rest of the group, I highly approve.

Best part: the menus. Hand written on notebook paper - nothing fancy, just pretty much awesome."}
{"text":"Love the selection of beers and it's damn closeness to my house! Yes!! $10 cab rides!  ;)"}
{"text":"Picture a southern BBQ joint in a busy urban centre, now add it a bit of urban-modern flare and you could easily be picturing AAA bar.

After watching a bit too much triple D on the food network, I was craving some Toronto BBQ and landed across this place. I whisked my cuz away on a 17km trip downtown to try this joint and we both left saying \"when can we come back?\"

We arrived at 7:30pm mid-week and the place was quickly filling up. We were seated immediately and were fore-warned when we ordered our food, it would likely take 30 minutes to come. We were willing to wait but it was nice to know ahead of time.

The atmosphere is pleasant with a mix of small groups relaxing and bigger groups having a fun night out. This place has a full bar and is open late almost everynight.

I LOVE the menus! They're handwritten on note-paper! With extra notes from previous days written across them (such as 'x's next to the dishes they had been out of), it's something I've never seen before. On top of what's written on the paper there are also daily specials that the waiter/tress will tell you when you place your order.

I had the chicken and waffles. I don't have anything to compare it to because to me it was a first. The sweet of the maple syrup and the savory from the fried chicken made this dish a new item to put on my list of comfort foods. The chicken wasn't overly fried but seasoned very gently so that you got a good taste of the chicken with each bite. The waffles...well reallly now, it's hard to complain about anything waffle! My cuz had one of the specials and had no complaints.

At the end of the evening our waiter/tress became very scarce. They were around when we wanted another drink but when it was time to pay, they were MIA! We had to tell them twice that we were ready for our bill; however, that's not enough to spoil the rest of the evening.

We will be returning to this place, it will only be a matter of when. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Like most other reviewers have said, AAA bar serves up some solid BBQ. The ribs are cooked with a dry rub and tasted almost like cured like bacon. Never had any quite like that, but I'm a big fan. 

The highlight for me was the mac and cheese. Not sure what made it so good, but I'm eating the leftovers we had packed up and still loving it today."}
{"text":"Went out with a friend. The place boasts $5 pints and great ribs. The ribs, I found, were awfully dry. I don't do beer so I did cider - which for $5 is a steal. 

It's a dive bar. In the pictures, it looks like the bar has quite the selection. Not quite. They don't do many mixes or cocktails. The place is super lax. The servers literally stroll into the order taking. I don't know if I like or dislike that; just something I am not really used to. 

Also, their menu is handwritten on a piece of paper. While many will find this unique and cool, I don't quite. This place is clearly not spending a penny on marketing and in this day and age, I almost find it offensive. 

So.. Meh. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favourite bars in the city. Hands down, awesome ribs, good atmosphere and convenient location."}
{"text":"Loved it here. I went there twice in one weekend. If you're looking for somewhere intimate, chill, and relaxed - head here. The bartenders are very friendly - a great spot to sit alone and drink a beer and watch the game. Also a great place to head with friends. The nachos are to DIE for."}
{"text":"Okay food with great service. They don't take reservations but Raquel was amazing at helping me try and some space for my boyfriends surprise party of 8. On a Friday night. After a huge hockey crowd. I couldn't have thanked the staff enough. 

You can't go wrong with $3.00 tequila shots. They don't offer salt or lemon so buck up! Tequila was smooth, no burning after taste. 

Despite the packed house, we received our food promptly with the brisket and dry ribs taking a little longer. The fish tacos were the best dish of the night. I didn't mind the chicken and waffles but I feel that there may be better in the city. 

A characteristic spot in the heart of St. Lawrence market filled with a wide range of people- from young financiers to retired folk, this is a hidden gem that makes you feel like you're in another city."}
{"text":"My favourite bar in the hood. Great staff who care about giving good service to their neighbourhood. I love the fish tacos and the corn on the cob is awesome. Always have great drink specials too!"}
{"text":"I've been to Texas and this place is the real deal. Quality dry rub ribs, brisket and pulled pork for a fair price. Beers are plenty with some interesting options to boot. Whiskey fans will rejoice, there's a big selection to be had.

It may not look like much, but trust me when I say come on down 'y'all and have a slice of Texas... Even if it is in the middle of a depressingly frigid Canadian winter!"}
{"text":"I know I was on vacation but AAA bar made me feel right at home. Great bar, kind of divey with a good beer/shot special and BBQ.

I ended up coming here three separate times when I was in Toronto. Mainly for the low key vibe and the cheap drinks. It was actually recommended to me by a few locals and I can see why.

The bartenders were super friendly and like to chat, the same with the crowd. 

The food was hit or miss. I had the lunch nachos one day after I stopped in after a long walk and they were pretty mediocre. But I had the ribs at night and they were spectacular. Meaty with a dry rub and a great kick to them. And to be able to get them at midnight along with a $8 draft pint and shot of tequila - that is something pretty awesome. 

If I am ever back in Toronto - I am going to swing by AAA again. Fun times."}
{"text":"This is the absolute best meal my better half and I have had in a long time! We are in town visiting from the States and thanks to Yelp, found this gem.

I would consider a more hipster/dive bar but would recommend this to anyone looking for something a little local/different. Their draft selection is simple and nice, and their menu is simple and delicious!

You HAVE to try the chipotle mayo that comes with the onion rings! 

I had the pulled pork and the gf had the chicken and waffles. OUTSTANDING for both! 

An absolute must visit before you die!!"}
{"text":"It's loud, it's young, it's over priced by a lot (double shot of Bullet bourbon is $18ca. But it was close to where I stay when in Toronto. Didn't try the food. It's proudly a dive with very casual dressed bartenders, kegs stacked about near the back, but still not scary or intimidating. Guys behind the bar are good peeps. Music was eclectic: Deep Purple to new stuff to Folk music. Hipster but a bit on the cheesy side. Like they were using hipster to be cheap, but charged like it was on the lake. I went to a lake side bar (Amsterdam Brewhouse) the day before and had 3 drinks that cost less than one double bourbon at AAA. Young sharks making big bank on run down looks and hipster trend. Meh. Next time me thinks: not"}
{"text":"It does one thing and it does well - Southern style BBQ. It is not pretentious and a bit on the hipster side (perhaps only me) but all in all fun atmosphere, good food and impressive bourbon selection.

Prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly. Visited several times and the only \"complaint\" (more like a wish) would be to have a better beer selection. A place to enjoy."}
{"text":"Great drink specials! Cool atmosphere. No low fat or vegetarian options on the menu is a bummer... If you like smoked/bbq'd meat, check AAA out!"}
{"text":"Strolled in for last call on our walk back to the hotel. Pleased to find BBQ potato chips in bowls on the bar instead of peanuts, and spent the entire time there plotting on how to convince other patrons to give us their chips. The AAA draft was your average, non-offensive tasting light beer."}
{"text":"Great tiny place and enjoy good music, good beer and good food. I didn't think I would enjoy the food as much as I did but damn it impressed me. I would come again and again. 

Smoked chicken wings and the brisket poutine hit the spot. 

Great staff and a relax spot to enjoy night."}
{"text":"Okay, I had hopes that this place would be better. 

When you walk in there is an over powering odor of Brussel sprouts, and the air is pretty thick (strong humidity). We had reservation for 8 people, and when we walked in, no one knew about the reservations. The place was not busy however so we were told to find a seat wherever we liked in the back. We found a section that suited out needs. The chairs however were splintery and ended up tearing my tights! There is also a random old spaghetti factory door there...which kind of seems misplaced and odd. 

We sat for forever before our drink orders were taken. FOREVER. realistically about 15 minutes. Which is a while to be seated in a near empty place.  

When we started to order I requested that mine and my husband's bill be separate and the waiter said dismissively \"we can deal with that later\". Fine. 

On to the food. We ordered a variety of items for our group. I'll go best to worst. 

Ironically, the best thing...which was why the whole place smells...THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS. they are the best thing the restaurant has to offer! They are both crispy and moist. Not your mamas Brussel sprouts!

The ribs. They were flavorful. Not overly meaty or dry. Decent. Not amazing. 

The smoked wings: They were basically Jerk Chicken Wings. could have been cooked a little bit more.

The coleslaw. It was alright. There was a little too much dressing for my taste. I don't like my cabbage swimming in dressing inside the serving bowl. 

The Brisket, it was a little dry, nothing that stands out as spectacular. 

The Poutine: Nothing special. (basic theme of the whole place) The fries we not that crispy and the the presentation of the whole thing basically looked like barf. Poutine isn't exactly a work of art, but when its all flat on the plate, it looks less than appetizing. 

Back to the bill. Towards the end of the night, we requested the bill. which took a while. And it was all on one bill. They never asked how to separate it. I took it upon myself to separate it for them and then had them issue it properly. Two of the bills were cash and one debit. They never came to collect the bills/cash, Or to charge the debit card. Our entire group had to go up to the bar to get any change or service. 

I really wanted to 1 star this place. but the brussel sprouts saved it!"}
{"text":"Monday night we walked by this bar, on our way to another bar... It looked really cool from the outside so after getting about a block past AAA we actually decided to turn around and go back to check it out instead of going to our original destination. What a mistake. We walked in to a dead bar (it was a Monday, I'm not offended that it wasn't busy...) but you would think that considering we were 2 of 10 people in the place the bartender would've acknowledged us as we walked in. We sat ourselves at one of the high top tables by the bar and waited there for 5 mins and did the classic stare at the staff until they make eye contact and realize we haven't been greeted/dont have drinks/have been waiting for a while. Instead, the bartend and server were doing shots with other guests, probably drunk, didn't care at all that we had walked in and didn't even seem to notice that we also walked out. I will never come back here. First impressions last, which is too bad because we were really excited about coming here."}
{"text":"Great addition to my neighbourhood!

The do have sides so I am not sure what an earlier reviewer meant.  They don't necessarily come with your meal, but the price is right and you get the side you want.

Food is very good and prices are reasonable.  Ribs are great. . .dry rubbed.  Fries are homemade. . .beans are ridiculously tasty!

Service has always been fantastic. . .the owners and staff make you feel at home.  One of my favorite Margaritas in Toronto. . ."}
{"text":"Dinner: Dry rub ribs (10/10) - usually a fan of super saucy ribs but these were amazing! Also not at all fatty. For your side, get the coleslaw and make sure it's spicy! My sister is a huge coleslaw fanatic and she said it's the best she's ever had. 

Drinks: Really good beer for only $5. Gets really busy on a Friday/Saturday night. Nice place to go for a drink with a friend or a large group - lots of seating and relatively quick service."}
{"text":"Definitely the best ribs in Toronto. I have never had meatier ribs anywhere, and I love the dry rub. Wonderful service from Ari as always. He's a great bartender/server and is so much fun! Give this guy a raise!"}
{"text":"Decent staff and service. Their local beer is around $5 a pint with a decent alternate selections. Menu is limited but very tasty. Based on dry ribs. I would give it a much higher rating except the menu is quite expensive. 3-4 dry ribs is . $15 but only comes with two slices of white bread. You purchase sides. 

However, I still recommend this place. Usually busy with after work people because it is a fun place with a good staff."}
{"text":"This was a hip BBQ joint. Ate dinner on a Thursday evening and was able to get a table on the spot. The place filled up pretty fast before the end of our meal. Seemed to be lots of locals out eating dinner or having drinks after work. 

My wife had the brisket and mac & cheese. I had the ribs and fries. The brisket was on the dry side and so we had to douse it with the house BBQ sauce which was sweet yet a little spicy. Unfortunately, the mac & cheese looked and tasted like it came out of a kraft box. We were expecting more flavor and taste aside from the sprinkled cheese on top and ended up adding hot sauce to the dish to liven it up.  We both enjoyed the ribs. I ate the meat right off the bone and with the BBQ sauce. The meat was still somewhat juicy when I sunk my teeth into them as well. The fries looked over done but tasted like they were double fried and were really crunchy. The aoli/thousand island served with it for dipping was pretty good but I also had the ketchup out for dipping as well. 

Overall pretty good dining experience. I would come back if I am ever in Toronto again and hopefully I can try the chicken and waffles.  AAA only receives three stars because of the brisket. If it wasn't dry we would have given it at least 4."}
{"text":"I wouldn't make this bar your first choice on a Saturday night - but if you're in the area on a weekday, it's worth dropping by for a few drinks. Open 7 days a week and on Sunday nights, it's very busy inside - a contrast to the quiet East Toronto neighbourhood.

{"text":"I moved into the neighbourhood this summer, and have been to AAA a number of times for a laid-back, after-works drink atmosphere. I usually have a great time, and love your staff.


This is why it was even more upsetting, what I encountered a few weeks ago, after raving about your bar to a few friends of mine, and getting them to come try it for their first time.


I arrived about 20 minutes earlier than my friends, around 830pm on Tuesday. There were two male bartenders at the time present. One was taller with long hair in a ponytail (he was quiet, but seemed fine), the other had long hair and wore a baseball hat backwards. Shorter than the other guy, around 5\"6.


From the moment I arrived at 830pm on Tuesday Dec. 6, 2016, this second (hatted) bartender seemed clearly intoxicated. On drugs or alcohol, I'm not sure, though I did observe him taking shots throughout the course of the night.


I ordered the rail tequila ($3, as I know from coming to AAA quite a few times before), and the house beer ($5). He brings my drinks back and tells me \"that'll be $20\". I asked if he was mistaken, as I know for a fact the total should have only been $8. He again insisted, \"no, it's $20\"... while keeping a straight face. It wasn't until I insisted again that \"I've come here many times before, and it's even openly advertised that the tequila is $3 and house draft is $5.\" It wasn't until he could see that I wasn't going to be fooled that he laughed and said \"I was just kidding, man!\"


I thought nothing of this, and laughed with him, thinking he was genuinely just fooling around.


Soon my two male friends and one female friend showed and we ordered a few more drinks (the lady didn't, she was driving so all she had was water).


Eventually we get our bill which, between the 4 of us comes to around $67. We put $80 cash (4x$20 bills) on the table in front of the hatted bartender. Of this all 4 of us are positive... we had no drank to the point of being drunk, and the female with us was completely sober and had nothing to drink, and she also clearly remembers us putting down $80, and we were planning on not even asking for change back (considering the extra we'd left as a generous tip.)


The bartender who had previously tried to trick me into paying more for my initial 2 drinks took the 4 $20 bills, then comes back and lays out 3 $20 bills stating \"you guys are short $7. You only gave me $60.\" To which I laughed, thinking like before, he was just \"messing with me.\" Even my friends laughed, because before they arrived I had texted two of them saying how this bartender tried to rip me off earlier, claiming he was \"joking\".


The bartender kept insisting he wasn't lying, and we had only put down $60 on a $67 bill, to which my friends and I argued he was wrong-- all 4 of us were certain of putting $80 in front of him, and seeing him take it. Even this guy's coworkers seemed to believe us, and I had seen them watching him carefully throughout the night, I'm assuming they could also tell he was intoxicated while working and felt nervous having him behind the bar.


At one point after the con-artist bartender continued to argue with me, claiming we had ripped him off $7, I said to prove he wasn't cheating us by emptying out his pockets, because I believe he pocketed one of the $20 bills that went \"missing\". He became very angry at this and ran out from behind the bar, came within 2 inches of my face in a threatening manner, insisting that I check his pockets for him. I took this as an obvious signal that he was looking for any reason to throw a punch and become violent.


At this point the other bartender intervened and even said \"you guys can go, don't mind him, he's a bit of a hotthead\". A few things to note here:


1. A guy serving customers while intoxicated and trying to rip off not only the customer but the establishment (AAA) itself should be fired, as he can't be trusted.


2. A guy who is so delusional and impulsive as to think he, at 5\"6 and not particularly muscular, can take on 3 full grown men who are all bigger than him and more sober than him, cannot be trusted to make rational decisions and work at a bar. If this happened at 9-10pm on a calm Tuesday evening with sober customers, imagine what might happen in the future when the customers he tries to rip off are not as sober or understanding?


3. A guy who thinks it's reasonable that between 4 customers (my friends and I) we'd care to rip him off $7 (that's only about $1.75 each we'd be making if we genuinely were cheating him by $7), and not realize that most rational people would think it's much more likely that he (one individual) was trying to make a quick $20 from us, clearly this kind of person underestimates the intelligence of everyone else and overestimates his own \"cleverness\".


4. He was willing to get violent over $7, while he had essentially stolen from us (we gave him $80, he claimed we only gave $60). There were at least four witnesses to this."}
{"text":"In this area you wouldn't expect a divey hipster-esque bar to be as popular as it is. Also you wouldn't expect it to have frigging fantastic ribs. 

At least I didn't. I just stopped by with a coworker to grab some drinks and decided to try out the dry rubbed ribs. Now, to be completely honest, I was never a huge fan of ribs. But these were smoked to perfection and their bbq sauce just is the perfect combination of sweet and tangy. 

Starting to drool thinking about those ribs. Yes would go back for sure. One star off because the acoustics in there suck and I was having to yell at my friend because of how noisy it gets in there."}
{"text":"Live right next door.  The burger is excellent.  Went there on two different occassions and they said they do not have meat.  You do not have meat? Once on a Friday, then on a Saturday evening, huh??? The bbq worst I've ever had.  Really, really bad. The chicken and waffles, pathetic.  I don' t even know if that was chicken.  Batter was soggy and looked baked rather than fried. These are very arogant people who have no clue about customer service.  Because they are packed, they could care less how they treat their patrons.  It is a mystery as to why this establishment is packed they must be servjng them good drinks because it ain't the food! But if you continue to treat your patrons as you do they will stop coming for the drings there is a pub on every corner in T.O. Every dog has its day.  They will not last.  I hope things will get better but I will never know unless I walk past there and see a big closed sign. Lol. AAA Bar get it together!"}
{"text":"I could eat brisket every day of my life but the ribs at AAA make me question my devotion. Enjoy $5 pints and cheap mix drinks but skip the sides and focus on the BBQ. The service is generally solid, but can be slow when it's crowded. Speaking of, it can also get really loud as it fills up. That's especially true on game nights that overlap with weekends. In general, I'd suggest visiting during the week when it's more likely to be on the quieter side."}
{"text":"Have been there 4 times, after work and late night. Great real bar atmosphere. Enthusiastic staff and patrons ! Standoffish hipster vibe nowhere to be found. It feels like being in a good bar in the USA, where the staff enjoy their job and engage customers. Hard to find that vibe here in the 416. Ribs are really good and the drink prices are not out of line."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite neighbourhood bar! It's a weird (cool), Southern bar that serves great drinks and finger food. If you're in the area and looking for a place to have a drink this is should be your place to go."}
{"text":"I had the special of the day which was steak. I'm a bit of a steak snob these days and I felt that I could have made a better steak myself. It was pretty mediocre. This place's saving grace is the feel and service. I'd come back for a beer"}
{"text":"Funky fun casual enviro. Younger crowd. Food tasty and reasonable but not award winning. Beef burrito made wth steak and had good flavour. Mac n cheese waz lacking in pizazz perhaps needed sharp cheese n some pepper. Staff seemed average friendly."}
{"text":"Its okay for lunch, quick greasy food and beer. It looks pretty cool inside, very western theme. 

Just a regular good old bar, as you'd expect."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and lively on a weeknight. We enjoyed the $5 pints but the food took quite a while to arrive. When it did arrive, the portions was quite small for the price and taste was alright but not spectacular."}
{"text":"Relaxed with a cool interior, its a great place for a drink - albiet a bit loud.  If you are in a group, it is a challenge to hear beyond a person or two.  There is a great selection of beer and the staff is extremely friendly.  The space is long and narrow with the bar in the middle separating the two sides.  The result feels very private.  I look forward to coming back and trying the BBQ"}
{"text":"Good food and great service!

There were 3 of us that ordered- 

1) fried chicken and waffles: the chicken was cooked perfectly, not greasy, juicy but I feel a little short-changed on the the portion, they do give you a leg and a breast piece but for $14 other fried chicken places (Stockyards, White Brick Kitchen) give a much larger portion. 

2) dry rub ribs: massive pieces of a half-r ac but no sides, which is a little disappointing considering it's $15, wouldbe nice if they threw in a small bowl of even just coleslaw or something. Anyway, it was pretty tasty (don't think I've had dry rub ribs before) but the ribs weren't as fall off the bone as Im used to (is this because it's dry rub?)

3) Texas chili - very tasty and meaty!! My fav dish of the night, came with a side of white bread and tortilla chips (would be better if these were homemade and not Tostitos brand)

We ordered a side of beans, the portion was big enough to share between 3 people. 

The AAA Bar house draft is only $5, which is a good deal. 

I will go back here and eat more."}
{"text":"Having heard about AAA from others and undoubtably being a very welcome new addition into the Chinatown East neighbourhood, I had high hopes. They only met them halfway.

The good stuff first: The vibe is great! A lot of the décor is left over from Mr. Chow but it's beautiful and the additions they've made really rounded it out nicely. No complaints about the friendly staff. The patio is well-laid-out and much quieter and chill than it looks. The sausage was delicious, and the table loved the fish tacos. The slaw was good and not too acidic or soggy. The staff was knowledgable about the menu and didn't rush anybody.

Okay, the bad: The most baffling thing they do is use sliced white sandwich bread (Wonder bread-type) for everything. This is bizarre and really hurts the perception of what is a pretty expensive menu for what is delivered. The yummy sausage described above ($9) was a single sausage cut in half placed in two tiny Wonder bread pieces with a miniature, insignificant thimbleful of coleslaw, arriving in an ugly plastic basket. Thats it.

The presentation of all the dishes was also doing AAA no favours. There basically is none. The ribs, chicken wings, etc. are just tossed unappetizingly into the plastic baskets on white paper without any apparent thought. The brisket sounds amazing and then when it shows up it's just sitting there dry with two slices of Wonder bread as if a sad trombone sound effect was on the menu with it. This makes for an underwhelming arrival at the table.

As for our other dishes, the jerk chicken wings were fine but hardly spicy in the least (why bother calling them jerk?) and the corn was dry with emaciated kernels and not the juicy, plump, seasoned cob that one would expect. The portions for most dishes are small, which would be fine if they weren't positioning themselves as a barbecue joint. They bring a selection of sauces to the table (yay!) but the dishes arrive looking as desiccated as the Sahara--a disconnect from the saucy delight most people expect when ordering wings and ribs.

It's so bizarre that a restaurant with such careful and effective branding and décor drops the ball on the actual food presentation and quality. I don't get it. They've got so much going for them, and the neighbourhood truly wants them to succeed. The good news is that a few changes could make a big difference. The bad news is that AAA ain't the place it pretends to be."}
