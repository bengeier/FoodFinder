{"text":"Frickiaccios has a tender place in my heart; as a child I would go to the West Side market with my dad and he would often treat me to a pizza bagel from their stand. A pizza bagel is exactly how it sounds - pizza dough shaped like a bagel, smothered with sauce and cheese. Essentially a one-serving pizza pastry. I can probably trace the origin of my love of pizza to the pizza bagel.   Now Frickiaccios has expanded with a storefront in Fairview. Of course they still have pizza bagels!! The focus is on regular pizzas, though. It's essentially a pizza place with deli sandwiches and salads. They have prepared foods also: Italian-inspired soups, pizza dough, bake-at-home lasagna, pastas, pasta sauce. I frequently stop in for a quick lunch or to grab something to take home to the fam for dinner.  No seating - it's all carry out and made to order. The also cater."}
{"text":"I have purchased many items from Frickaccios - mainly  the West Side Market stand. I have never had any problems in the past but was very disappointed after a recent purchase of one of their pizza kits. I have made their pizza kits in the past and loved them, but upon opening the kit's outer bag (which had gone straight to my freezer and stayed there a week until ready to prepare), I discovered such a downgrade in the packaging they used for the sauce and cheese, the food actually looked compromised in the makeshift packaging. The sauce and toppings did not look safely edible and I decided to discard the kit. I used to enjoy the food there,  but will be hesitant to make any further purchases."}
{"text":"New location or should I say, a new extension of the A8 stall of the Westside Market .  Just opened in the former place of the traitorous Gray House Pies, they carry the pizza bagels you are used to and love. They also carry some desert items along with beverages.  The pizza can be to go or to take and bake . They offer whole wheat, and organic crusts as some of the options.  I love the fresh mozz as a choice and my bagel was good and fresh.  They offer fresh veggies all from the market as toppings, along with some unusual toppings such as balsamic reduction and Alfredo.  A small selection of fresh veggies were also available in whole form, again from the market as well.  Now, when I want a pizza bagel, I don't have far to go.  WHEEEEE!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this little hole in the wall for a pizza bagel today. I was expecting your normal pizza bagel, maybe a little better than average. Nope. Blew my mind. Soft and chewy dough, amazing flavors, and the perfect balance of sauce.   This is so getting added to my favorite local places."}
{"text":"I ventured in today (Friday May 15, 2015) with the plan to check this place out.  Our family had a whole series of errands today so dinner prep would be very limited.  I picked up a good sampling of their products - pepperoni rolls, pizza bagels, lasagna (ready to warm), pesto sauce, tiramisu and cannoli's.  My overall evaluation - very, very bland for Italian food.  Yes I have bought their bagels and rolls at the Westside market.  However this is the first and last time I will ever venture into their other products.  I would really recommend avoiding at all costs as the products are lacking much of anything - they are just bland.  I'd review the pizza bagels and pepperoni roll as acceptable.  I've had the bagels at the market numerous times and this example stood true to past experiences.  The pepperoni roll was acceptable.  The pesto sauce had no nuts at all in it which left it very bland.  The lasagna was fair - nothing wrong with it, just not much going on with it.  The desserts were a major waste.  The cannoli's were fresh filled so I had promise.  But my wife was quick to point out how bad they were.  I just took my bite and totally agreed.  That fresh filling had no flavor to it - zero, zip, none.  My daughter who is a tiramisu fan began her assessment as soon as I got it in the house - very bland.  I tasted it and agreed.  Overall this experience set me back $42, if my memory is correct.  $7 for 4 bagels, $9 for the lasagna, cannoli's were $2.50 each and the tiramisu was approx. $5.  That probably means the pepperoni rolls were about $3 each and sauce about $5.  I must say - I will stop there for pizza bagels and I may buy a pepperoni roll but I never would venture beyond that.  Total waste of money for what you receive."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza bagels and great service -- plus we love supporting local businesses.  We recently used some of their pizza dough on our own pizza stone and it turned out great!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to support local family run businesses but the food here was not good enough to make me return. The salad was perfectly fine, but the pizza bagel was chewy, with no crisp whatsoever, like it had been microwaved. The sauce was lukewarm, and the veggies just sat on top. The mushrooms had no flavor and the spinach was totally raw.  (My mom did enjoy her Italian wedding soup.) The garlic bread pieces served on the side were chewy, not crisp. (Is everything here microwaved?) The interior made me sad. It looks like the dining hall of a senior citizen's center. Not that there's anything wrong with a senior citizen's center, but it's way to0 clinical and drab and decorated in a hodge-podge manner to be a place I'd like to sit in again. The service was friendly."}
{"text":"I tried ordering a vegan pizza and was told it would take at least 2-3 hours. Really? You can't keep one maybe two vegan doughs in house, and that way you don't have to go all the way down to the west side market to get the vegan dough?  And why is the vegan pizza only whole wheat?  Amazingly enough this fine establishment is having a vegan meet up tonight....but again has no vegan dough on site!!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place while on my way to Little Caesar's. I definitely made the right choice by coming in here instead. I bought two Stromboli and a pizza roll. Since it was the end of the day, she also threw in a few extra goodies. Needless to say, I was impressed with the wonderful, friendly service, as well as the food.  I later went back to try some of the fresh pizza dough and it was great!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try while we were babysitting the grandkids on a Friday night.   We ordered a large and they even had green olives which is a big plus as most pizza places don't.  The pizza was exceptional-- sauce and crust equally as good as one another and ratio of sauce to dough was perfect.  Will definitely be going here again  My husband reported very friendly service, which was the icing on the cake."}
