{"text":"I sat at the bar for breakfast. My server Raven did a fantastic job. It was a busy morning but she handled it all with efficiency and grace. She had a sincere, friendly, demeanor and remembered everyone's names.  The breakfast was very good, often hotel breakfast can be kind of sad. My omelet was perfect and it came with delicious fingerling potatoes that were NOT over cooked or over salted."}
{"text":"One would expect the dining facility in a Shearton Hotel to be top notch, not here.  Food is over priced for the bland taste you get.  Service is terrible.  I had a burger and fries ($15) that was only modestly better than what you'd get from a fast food place.  I had to ask someone to take my order, I had to ask for drink refills, I had to ask for the check, and I even had to then ask someone to take my money to play my bill.  Very poor experience."}
{"text":"Still brand new and working out kinks. The Brussels sprout salad is terrific. The fries are hand cut and delicious."}
{"text":"Bad hotel food.  Paid $12 for a fried chicken/bacon/avocado sandwich.  Bread was stale and chalky. fried chicken was dry. hardly any mayo made this the driest sandwich I've ever eaten.  Great fries though!  Overall I would have preferred subway.  FYI This is the same restaurant that provides the room service in the Sheraton.  Avoid it."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that the Charlotte Center City isn't the best hotel in town, it has a pretty good restaurant located in it, and is one of the best aspects to the hotel.  Stuff is on the pricier end here, and it seems needlessly so, but the stuff ain't bad. For dinner one night, I had the po boy shrimp sandwich and it was very good.  Several of the days I went here there was a great breakfast buffet. Way pricey at almost $20 bucks, but had a good selection. For whatever reason, there was no buffet on Thursday morning, so I had the egg sandwich with bacon and cheese. It was very greasy, not bad, but it seemed like a bunch had been made that morning and this guy was just heating up under a lamp.  Other evenings I had tea and beer. Not the biggest selection of the latter, but some nice  local beers.  One of the best aspects of the place was the service. Top notch service here. Not a single iota of complaint or critique. Keep on keepin on.  Also, the music they play in the background here is just darn good. I'm sure the employees get sick of it, but it isn't your regular Muzak. It's pretty classy. I'm sorry if you get stuck at this hotel site for other reasons, but the restaurant and bar won't be one of them."}
{"text":"Food is okay but really pricey for quality. Drinks are way overpriced and I'm not a Scrooge about bar tabs. $26 for Atlantic Salmon and $13 for one Makers Mark? Sit way too long for check as well.   Here for conference and barely got my lunch in time for an hour break. Bear in mind all I had was a salad with chicken breast. Another group didn't get their food in time at all."}
{"text":"Leans towards pretentiousness, especially with its prices. Food is decent and the Manhattan I had at the bar was well made. The large round ice cube in my glass had melted to the size of a marble when I asked for another. Before I knew it my glass was returned with the remaining, now pea sized ice cube, floating in it. Seriously?!  How about a fresh glass and ice with the $20 cocktail? I should have sent it back but became too preoccupied with my table conversation.  If you're going to charge premium prices you had better supply premium service."}
