{"text":"We are locals and decided to try Jayde since we love the M Hotel so much and thought for sure it would be great. We were less then impressed. We all started off with the cucumber salad that had been made early in the morning or possible left over from the night before. It was horrible and dried out and bitter.We all remained optimistic about the food we were about to receive but, looking back we should have just left. The tuna was horrible and none of us could eat it. The waiter acted like he had heard that a time or two. Some of us tried more rolls and some of us decided to go the Jadye Specialties. The fried rice at Panda Express is much better, the only item we could all eat was the dumplings. There was 5 of us and we all vowed we would never ever go back. Also, the staff could care less if you enjoyed the food or not."}
{"text":"The reason why is because when I tasted the food it tasted like garbage. I tried the honey cashew chicken no taste just flan"}
{"text":"Ordered the poke salad, korean street tacos, japchae, honey walnut prawns, and sashimi. Apps: - Poke salad: beautiful presentation, good portion, fresh fish - Korean street tacos: very flavorful but the 3 pancakes kept ripping, one was brought to us already with a slit down the center Dinner: - Japchae: least favorite dish, too salty - Honey walnut prawns: Huge prawns, heavy tempura batter made them look even bigger, nice flavor - Sashimi: Ordered hamachi, toro, and albacore tuna? Hamachi was the best  Service: I'm okay with waiters leaving you alone at times to enjoy your meal but our waiter was pretty much MIA. He took our drink and appetizer order first, those were brought out and finished, plates cleared, but he hasn't returned to take our dinner order. We waved someone over who turned out to be the manager, told us he'd get our waiter. When our waiter finally arrives he asks us \"what else did you WANT?\" like we were inconveniencing him for wanting to order more food.  Summary: good food, subpar service"}
{"text":"We were at the M on a Thursday night and wanted a little sushi... we were told that only the \"all you eat\" sushi was available at $26... we split a sandwich at the bar."}
{"text":"There are only 11 seats here, so chances are you will not get to be seated, They are advertising everywhere and all over, what they are doing is getting you in the door then breaking the bad news that there are no seats right now, but they say \"you are welcome to order from our menu\" which means full price. People are going to get mad at this scam, I sure did, we drove all the way from summerlin hoping to get the all u can eat but there were no seats and  by the time you get one at 9:30 they are closing so it's a scam.  If you can get a seat I'd say you are lucky, but to do this heavy advertising and only have 11 seats is just not cool. We actually bought into the scam and ordered from the full price menu at a table...they got us!  Never again tho"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! You definitely have to go with an appetite, I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Do they know the meaning of \" Cross Contamination\"? Chef was keep coughing without cover his mouth and wash hands at the three comp sink another chef was triming beef on the cutting board with his sushi knife without sanitizing neither before or after of course cutting board then he made rolls on that cutting board and that knife. Even he didn't keep right temperature for the beef just leave inside pan without ice underneath.  Sushi was okay pretty reasonable price but hot foods out of kitchen were little medicore under and over seasoned. Sorry chef."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Their sushi is always on point, the Korean street tacos are to die for, and the broccoli and beef melts in your mouth it's so good!!! This is a wonderful atmosphere to go to on a date night! (I've only been to the M casino location)"}
{"text":"We went early on a Tuesday night when the restaurant was slow and our service was great. Eric our server knew the menu and specials well and was happy to recommend things. Isaac our busboy was very attentive as well. We got the lucky seven roll that was on special and it was fantastic. We ordered the Kalbi ribs, kimchi fried rice, BBQ pork buns and the red snapper. The ribs and the kimchi rice were delicious- right on point. The red snapper didn't have much flavor unless you swiped across the sauce on the plate a few times. The BBQ pork buns were awful, barely any meat or sauce at all. The worst part is they were recommended. Overall, we enjoyed our experience and will come back soon."}
{"text":"First time to go to this place and we were disappointed and frustrated with the service and management. Very unpleasant, not nice and no consideration especially for first time customers."}
{"text":"The hostess had absolutely no warmth.  The waiter seemed bored.  He deliverd the introduction like a robot.  The food was tasty but very small portions.  The street taco plate that we're supposed to share had 3 little tacos.  Really?  You can't give us one more taco shell?  The beef chow main had 3 small slices of beef and small slice of baby bok choy.  $31 plus tax and tip later, we left to get dinner elsewhere.  Not worth the money and not worth the hype of the T.V. show."}
{"text":"Jayde Fuzion, of course, is the result of M Resort's longstanding partnership with the Food Network and its reality series \"Restaurant Express.\" Chef Seonkyoung Longest, also of course, won the TV competition and the privilege of opening a restaurant at the M. Be careful what you wish for, as Jayde Fuzion faces stiff competition inside the resort, notably from the M Buffet.  The sushi was excellent, the equal of any in town. We had a spider (soft shell crab) roll and a rainbow roll to complement our meal.  Next up were appetizers, lettuce wraps and chicken satay. Both were delicious, a little vinegary like you would expect of Korean food, not too overwhelming.  Our entrees were honey walnut prawns (6 extra large); and pepper filet medallions. The honey walnut prawns ($19) were about the same as at other Asian restaurants such as PF Chang's.  The three pepper medallions ($29) weren't too peppery, but they were small, and the dish came with maybe a tablespoon of excellent stir-fried veggies. We would have liked to have had more.  Although we ordered two sushi rolls, two appetizers, and two entrees, we didn't get enough to eat.   There's no rice on the menu except what comes with your sushi, and specialty fried rices ($12-19). Unlike PF Chang's that serves plain white or brown rice with entrees -- you can't get plain rice here at any price. This is a cheap stunt to up your bill by forcing you to buy specialty fried rice if you want rice.  There are only a few vegetables, I think Chinese broccoli, bok choy, and green beans.  The three pepper medallions ($29) weren't too peppery, but they were small, and the dish came with maybe two tablespoons of excellent stir-fried veggies. We would have liked to have had more.  The bill came to $115 for two with one dessert and two iced teas. BTW we loved the fresh iced tea.  As of June 1, Jayde Fuzion will compete with AYCE sushi restaurants such as Oyshi and Goyemon by offering AYCE sushi plus free sake for $25, assuming you're 21 and are willing to eat at the sushi bar. This may be a recognition that other AYCE sushi restaurants are Jayde Fuzion's rivals in the marketplace.  What's really missing from Jayde Fuzion's business model is a reason for anyone to go back a second time. If one is visiting the M, why not their excellent buffet, for half the price? Why not a nearby AYCE sushi restaurant for $30 all in? The market for Jayde Fuzion may be limited to people who want to check out the Restaurant Express winner, and people who are staying at the hotel and who don't have a car (and who can afford the relatively high price)."}
{"text":"I loved it.  First of all, I have to say I don't eat sushi.  My wife loves sushi, when ever we go to sushi restaurants, I get the Teriyaki.  This place has two all you can eat menus.  One with all sushi for $24.95 and one with all Japanese/Chinese fusion foods for $24.95.  If you want both menus, it is $32.95.  We got one of each, and I loved all of my menu.  The Chow Fun, is the best Chow Fun I have ever had.  It was sweet and had a little tang to it, it was good.  My second favorite would be the Korean Street Tacos.  Love the soft tortilla, much better than the corn tortilla.  Third would be the BBQ ribs, meat fell right off the ribs.  Fourth would be the chicken wrapped in lettuce.  The orange chicken is whatever, panda express is better.  Everything was made to order with full service.  AYCE that you don't need to get up.  Love it."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great at all and the sushi was poor quality! The rice was overly thick (I assume it's like that to make customers feel full faster) and all of the rolls were filled with some kind of crab blend. Too much sauce -- I was very disappointed! Never again! But the vodka sodas were delish (I only drink like 1-2 times a year but I ordered 4 drinks and I still wasn't drunk or even tipsy-- very strange considering that I usually feel tipsy after two drinks). Anyways if you are an unsophisticated sushi eater, then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Just like I did a review on this restaurant a couple of days ago. I am happy to inform everyone out there in YELP land,  that the Mgmt. @ M Resort contacted me and apologized for my experience. Mr. Cruz quickly convey the message to all the staff and corrections were made.   Same way I posted my original views, I am quick to post the POSITIVE RESPONSE from Mr. Cruz, Restaurant Manager.  It shows that they do care about their customers concerns and appreciate our suggestions. Thank You Jayde Fuzion!!!!!!"}
{"text":"By far some of the worst sushi I've had. The tiger roll had a gritty feel when I ate it, there was no real flavor in any of the rolls. I was highly disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Worst sushi we've ever had. I'm not sure if we are extra picky coming from California but it just want good. The yellowtail tuna was tough like chicken and the salmon was dyed red. The only positive was the friendly staff. Sorry-Jayde Fuzion..you should do better."}
{"text":"Went here for mothers day. Was a bit surprised to see that the restaurant was not as busy as other places usually are.  Had four people in my party and we shared all the dishes we ate. The Kimchi fried rice and Thai basil fried rice were quite tasty. I'm generally not a huge fan of rice but these two had great flavors within them.   The Korean street tacos were amazing! The bulgogi beef was well marinated and cooked. I enjoyed seeing the Korean style pancake used as the 'shell' for the tacos. The Kimchi they used was a very 'fresh' kimchi (not fermented). I'm not a big fan of this style of kimchi but to each their own.  The wait staff was very attentive. I rarely had a empty dish at my table, empty wine glass or empty glass of water. I felt like the waiter was always there when I needed him. So excellent customer service!  In closing the reason why I couldn't give this place a higher rating is simply how expensive it is. The Cost to food ratio is very high. I did not like that each item was around 12-25$ and i felt like it barely could feed one person. They should either lower the prices slightly or up the portion size a bit."}
{"text":"Jayde  fusion is a great restaurant, I was impressed from the moment I walked in, the decor and lighting is very relaxing, I recommend getting duck sliders as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Sat at sushi bar.  Our sushi chef, Sam, was friendly and easy to talk to.  For only two ppl, we ordered many dishes, including Korean tacos, shumai, oriental fried rice, mandarin beef noodle soup, calamari, pork buns, and Yuzu donuts.  We were super full. We told our waiter that we came to see the chef, and she stopped by to talk to us!  She was super sweet and despite a fully booked restaurant on nye, she spoke to us for several minutes and also took a picture with us:) the food was really yummy except for the mandarin beef noodles which had an herbal broth that didn't suit our taste."}
{"text":"I love their idea of all you can eat sushi and the price is the same as others, but the list is not as extensive as others. I loved the sake included. Your best bet is to order their special menu. I probably will only go back if I was at a party again but not to drive out to get my money's worth."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a coworker of mine who raved about this place for a long time. Living in Summerlin, however, it was far too long of a drive for my boyfriend and I to make \"just to try\". Luckily (or so we thought), we were driving back from California & decided to stop in for dinner. We're big fans of sushi, especially AYCE deals. We've been to some very good sushi bars in our area, so reading that this place was a 4star establishment, we had high expectations. We arrive around 6pm and we're told the wait would be about 20 minutes. Confused, because about 75% of the restaurant was vacant, we obliged and waited in the restaurant lounge. The hostess (Heidi) was polite and kept us updated regularly and apologized for the wait a few times as she passed by to seat other people. It wasn't until we were finally seated that we understood the AYCE section was reserved for the sushi bar and not the dining room seating (no complaints there). We were approached by a waiter fairly quickly who explained the menu briefly and brought us our waters no problem. We submitted our order and it, just like the service we'd already experienced, was quickly served to us. End positive feedback.  We had ordered eel, tuna, yellowtail and salmon nigiri (fish on rice). The only thing I can't complain about was the salmon, everything else was bland and unimpressive. We also ordered 4 or 5 rolls to share between the 2 of us. Problem #1: Their \"premium\" crab was worse than imitation crab bought at your local grocery store. (Instantly gag inducing)  Problem #2: Their spicy tuna looked and had the consistency of raw hamburger meat. (Again, instantly gag inducing) Problem #3: having almost everything topped with flavorless fish was only adding to the already unappealing-ness of the food.  The only things that got me through the meal were soy sauce, wasabi, ginger & refills of water.  As we continued with our meal, service started getting really sloppy, the sushi chefs were texting behind the counter, and a waitress and one of the chefs were unable to properly communicate an order, causing unnecessary awkward tension.  We could not get out of there fast enough and we most certainly will not be going back for any reason."}
{"text":"After reading the recent reviews, we were contemplating canceling our reservation. That would have been a huge mistake. We were seated at a table that provided us with a view of the setting sun. Our waiter, Ian, was knowledgable of the menu and made valid suggestions on choices that complemented our selections. Ian was attentative but not intrusive, allowing us to enjoy our dining experience. Our group \"sampled\" many menu items. We shared Duck Sliders, Dumplings, Crab Salad, and the Cucumber Salad. Next we enjoyed the Street Tacos followed by Chow Fun Noodles, Walnut Prawns and Duck Tacos. All selections were fresh, seasoned well and were easily shared. Our experience was EXCELLENT! Thank you Ian for making our evening such an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"They do this nasty trick if you don't make a reservation where they say they are full and you must wait 30 minutes(and take down your phone number).  I waited 1 hour and and came back and she said she tried reaching me.  I asked her what number she had and she had the correct one!  When we got inside, half the tables were empty.  If they want people to gamble so bad, try something else because I am never stepping foot in this casino again."}
{"text":"We were in the M casino and they had a deal where if you signed up for a card and played an hour of table games you got $30 off at Jayde.  We applied it for the all you can eat sushi and we also got one sake drink.   We sat the sushi counter where we can watch them make the sushi.   It's really confusing of which plate is ours after they are done making.  Also, it seemed like they lost an order between our plates because we waited a long while in between plates.   It was not even particularly busy the night we went.    Pros:  -Made to order all you can eat sushi.   - Fish was tasty.  -Good deal for all you can eat sushi  Cons:  - Rice was a little on the hard side.   - Wait was long in between orders.    We're from out of town(isn't everyone in Vegas?), but unless you're at the hotel or want something a little quieter away from the strip this place isn't too bad."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Food Taste: 4.5 Food quantity: 2 Service: 4.5 Price: $$$ (check for $61 with tax and tip, no EtOH, food only for two.) Value (1-5): 2  New joint at the M. New signs interested me as I typically drive by on a regular basis. Korean fusion food is no stranger to me, and this place seemed way closer than KoMex, so I decided to give it a shot with my g/f. Oh, there's sushi apparently too.  The food:  Spicy Tuna Roll: Not bad, not great.  Pleasant amount of spicy, but seemed a bit small for the price.  Surf and Turf Roll: Pretty good. Seems more substantial than the Spicy Tuna roll. Definitely offers more flavor, yet fairly well balanced.   Korean Street \"Tacos\" : some assembly required. decent appetizer dish. that sauce is amazing. Don't expect to be filled with this. 3 \"tortillas\" only.  5 Spiced Duck Sliders: Two small bao. intensely flavored. seems there is an addition of some sort of wine to the ingredient list. that particularly stuck out at me.  Kimchi fried rice: Likely the highlight of the dinner. Pleasantly spicy, rich tasting. The rice has a sort of \"doneness\" that makes it slightly \"crisp\" so that it sticks a little bit to your molars when you're munching away at it.   The Service: No problems. Food arrived in an appropriate amount of time. Seemed typical to me. Fairly attentive.  The Ambiance: Mildly noisy. Was a fairly busy night, but nothing close to a rock concert.  Conclusion: While understandably more upscale than say, KoMex, having twice the price and half the food seems a bit short on value when taste is nearly the same."}
{"text":"The decor of the restaurant looks nice, however that's all that was worth the trip. First of all the restaurant is very far away from the strip and all other popular destinations.   For 2 people, we ordered the dumplings, Korean noodles, and lemon chicken. The dumplings were ice cold and smelt like dog food. They are made with cheap wonton wrappers and they claim to be made with shrimp and pork, but trust me you can't taste or see any of these ingredients. The noodles were alright but too plain for the price- also the menu listed the noodles as \"sweet potato noodles\" but they were cellophane noodles. The chicken was a teriyaki katsu cutlet drenched in a thin translucent lemon sauce that you could easily make at home or buy at a teriyaki restaurant for a quarter of the price. Also every dish on the menu desperately needs RICE! But they don't offer it unless you ask (pay extra).  The service was lousy. Although they just opened our waitress was clueless about the menu. The waiters kept having personal conversations right next to us while they were serving us. Last note: You cannot find the bathroom easily and the servers don't care to be helpful."}
{"text":"Great options and top quality in all that's prepared. The Pho comes with heaps of veggies and second to none broth. For the price and top quality here you cannot go wrong.   Btw... the sushi is far above any other \"all you can eat!\""}
{"text":"I'm sure people in Vegas seen the billboards along the I-15 regarding the new AYCE with sake for $24.95 at Jayde Fuzion at the M Resort recently.  My husband and I figured we'd go try it since we love sushi.    FOOD (Quality/Temp/ - the food quality is questionable.  There were some things that we're pretty good and other things that were just pretty bad.  The AYCE includes (1) super extra small Carafe of sake (enough for 2 regular sake cups) per person, (1) miso soup per person and their very limited menu includes about 8 roll selections (optional handroll) and 8 Nigiri selection.    I had 1 spoonful of the miso soup and I pushed it away.  The shiitake mushroom was from dehydrated mushroom which is normally fine however they didn't rehydrate it enough so it that rough chewy texture.    The carafe of sake that is part of the price is valued at $20 (this is the price stated specific on their advertisement around the casino).  Yet the waitress said the sake carafe for that size is $10 if we wanted to purchase additional sake.    The rolls we did order from the AYCE menu weren't all bad.  What I didn't like was that they had common rolls (California roll, Spicy Tuna roll, and Spyder roll) as part of this already limited AYCE Menu.  The Nigiri were huge and not the best quality.  You can see from the texture, taste and smell of the fish in the roll and nirgi wasn't up to par as they advertise on the M resort Chef's quote that they fly the best quality in daily.  The already questionable fish and soft shell crab didn't go any better with the burnt plastic smell from their torch the sushi chefs were using.    SERVICE: Hostess - when we first got there, there was 1 person waiting already and a few couples arrived after we got there.  There was a line and no hostess... great start!  When the hostess finally arrived she ignored the first guest until I told her speak to her first since she was here first.  When we were getting seated it really bothered me that she didn't ask if we wanted to eat at the bar or not, she just automatically sat us there.    Waitress - she was nice enough but she didn't know how to approach guest.  She would serve between the guests of the same party when there were vacant seats around.  I mean, who wouldn't want to be elbowed while getting a water refill?   Sushi Chef - they were polite and very accommodating when my husband wanted to make the nirigi into a hand roll.  I don't fault them for the quality of the sushi since its not their fault they have to work with inferior products.    This is one of the places where I'm glad I went cause than I wouldn't have to wonder about it anymore.  However I would never tell anyone to come here to eat.  I'd definitely go to Sushi Bomb,  Sushi Mon (East side) or even drive always the way to the north side for Sushi Tachi!!"}
{"text":"I love the Chinese menu. My husband and I come here often on date night. Everything is delicious and the ambience is great. I haven't ordered the sushi so I cannot comment on that, but I highly recommend everything on the  Chinese menu. The price is also reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was excellent along with the fabulous service. Definitely will be back the next time we make it to Vegas. We will no longer head to the strip, the M resort is now our destination of choice. Great food and service."}
{"text":"We eat at most sushi place in town and thhis is the worse sushi place.  Chef wasn't friendly.  Ayce menu had little selections and lots lots of rice.  All the roll taste the same.  We can't order dinnner menu items at the sushi bar.  So if anyone doesn't eat sushi in your party they need to sit by themself.  Do not waste your money. I'm beeing nice with 1 star."}
{"text":"We had a great evening with friends and some very good food! Large, modern and comfortable. Excellent service. Large glasses of wine! Sharing plates have a nice variety, good quality and flavors were excellent. Nothing \"bland\" like others have said ... not too spicy - just right for our palates. Plum wine was a nice treat - sweet but right with Asian food. Prices are about what you'd expect at an upscale resort restaurant. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food classy atmosphere weekday all u can eat sushi and sake special is well worth it"}
{"text":"The Sushi was descent, however there was a special little friend in the edamame...a caterpillar happened to be living inside. I understand the restaurant may not have complete control of what pests decide to make it into their products.... BUT please aknowledge it an maybe send a manager to appologize. I am not the type of person who goes out to complain and get free food... belive me I was a sever for 10 plus years and those type of people are at the bottom of the totem pole for me. Although I was on vacation and the probability of going back was slim to none the way they handled the situation will definently prevent me from ever going back"}
{"text":"JAYDEN CONFUSION. Food and service is awful. Don't go here.   Place was full of empty tables but insisted we sit at the sushi bar looking over the garbage cans. Spoke to manager and he did move us but it was too late. The better seating couldn't make up for the horrible food and lack of service after we moved. Half of our meal was just left at the bar."}
{"text":"Maybe I just went to late but I was not impressed. They really didn't have any rolls that were warm or not doused in a sauce. The service was great though. I just had the AYCE sushi. The selection was limited but they do have nigiri and sashimi choices. I don't know I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I write very few reviews since most of the places I go to already have excellent reviews.  We took our son, visiting from Arlington, VA, to Jayde Fusion last night and were totally blown away! We go to the M Resort alot and were not impressed with the restaurant it replaced, but wanted to give the new restaurant a try.  We arrived fifteen minutes early for our reservation and the restaurant was packed so we sat at the bar and had cocktails served to us by a great bartender. There were enough bartenders so no one had to wait long for a drink.  The host came and escorted us to our table about two minutes after our reservation time; much better than we expected.  The servers were very knowledgeable about all the dishes and suggested some. We decided to share all the dishes and over the course of the next hour ordered the Five Spiced Duck Sliders, the Pork & Vegetable Spring Rolls, the Chicken Lettuce Wraps,  the S&P Calamari, the Steamed BBQ Pork Buns, and the Chow Fun Noodles. All this was accompanied by a few bottles of Asahi beer. We would have ordered additional items, but had no room to pack any more in. All the plates were excellent and, since we had three people, the kitchen was happy to adjust the plates to ensure we had three of each item.  During the time we were there, the manager (I assume) came over twice to make sure we were happy, and Chef Longest also stopped by and chatted with us!  We will certainly make this one of our regular stops!"}
{"text":"We celebrated a dear friend's birthday and truly enjoyed every dish!  We ordered ahi poke, chicken wraps, chow fun, honey walnut shrimp and BBQ pork bun.   The best part was the dessert!! White Chocolate strawberry yuzu mousse:) must have:)"}
{"text":"Thanks Chef Fon for the wonderful salmon belly & crab legs! Love to dine here once a week. Chef Fon & the rest of the staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic service. My friend is a Yelp Elite and she took me to this restaurant. They treated us so good and they're food was great, too. I wasn't a fan of their dessert though."}
{"text":"Update!!! Okay so I've been meaning to update my review since I mentioned I was going back, here it is :) soooo I must say sushi was STILL great quality, and SO delicious!! I did however notice service was a little slower this time, and I also noticed why. There were about 3 different people I saw complaining and slowing everything down. A couple next to us was one of them. Their complaint was that they got brought out the wrong sushi and kept insisting on a refund or discoubt, or something along those lines. (Sorry I was eavesdropping to better my review ;) ) other than that, food was still great and the view was still amazing!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the recent reviews are complaining about this place was FANTASTIC!!! The service was phenomenal, the food was amazing - fresh, cooked to order! The spring rolls are to die for!!! We had almost the entire specialty menu and everything was awesome. The chef even came out and talked to us. We are locals and will definitely be back! Thanks everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  We have been 4 or 5 times and the service is great and the food is tasty. Had the Korean tacos, chicken wraps and the lemon chicken is wonderful.   They give huge portions so order the all you can eat correctly.  You can't take home leftovers.   Very good overall!  Kids love too!"}
{"text":"This was a dining experience way out of our usual comfort zone. However we were big fans of the Restaurant Express show so wanted to try it. The room is beautiful and the service made our night very special. Our server Rose really helped us select some of the best offerings. She was so helpful in trying to discover what our tastes were and what we might enjoy. Her suggestions were great! We ended up ordering five different selections without being pressured to do so and each one had something special about it. Things were timed perfectly and brought out and cleared away in a timely manner. We were not drinking alcohol so as to be able to fully enjoy the flavors presented and were not rushed in any way. We enjoyed the food and the presentation. And we had actually budgeted a lot more than our bill was! So we ended up feeling as if we got a lot of value for the amount of food we had.  It was a lot of fun for us to try new things and we would highly recommend this place. We wish Seonkyoung Longest the very best of luck and happiness with her beautiful restaurant.!"}
{"text":"Great food! I have been here several times with coworkers.   Love-Korean street tacos, honey walnut prawns, steamed Bbq pork buns, duck sliders, ahi poke, Szechuan pepper crusted filet medallions. Chocolate banana eggrolls (yum), white chocolate strawberry yuzu mousse, coconut cake.  Didn't care for-Tom Kha Gai soup, Fried Rices (Thai Basil is good if you like spicy), Pad Thai is bland. Thai tea ice cream.  Mixed Reviews-I didn't care for the Cobia but my coworkers liked it. Wagyu short rib was ok to half of us and good to the other half."}
{"text":"We live close & love the all you can eat for $25. We have always just walked in, but they are closed on Mondays & Tuesdays. We ate there last night & ate at the sushi bar.  I don't think they do the free sake anymore but I did try a new drink with Stoli Elit strawberries lime & mint and it was refreshing! We usually order 3 orders of salmon, tuna & yellowtail sushi, the jayde roll, surf n turf roll & orange zest roll. All the other rolls are kinda plain. But the service & view from the sushi bar are pretty good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service could be better once you get your first servings.  I thought the sake was overpriced @ $13 a glass especially when the meal is AYCE sushi for $25. The restaurant has good decor and lots of room.  Everything was fresh. Not a lot of choices for nigiri. Rolls ok."}
{"text":"I wished I read the review before we went for dinner.  The menu looks great online and everything sound yummy but I was a little bit disappointed by the flavors.  Now if you just wanted something simple, this is the place but definitely not a Foodie place.    When we arrived, we were seated but they seated us at the sushi bar, which we asked to be seated at the table afterward.  It took about five minutes before someone came and asked if we were helped.  It was a Monday and the place looked slow, just like the service.  And it has nothing to do with the server, he was tentative as much as possible but as we looked around, they were unorganized in staffing.  Which that is management's job.  There were too many bussers and not enough waitstaff, so our server was running around until he had only one table (us) to be able to be more attentive.    Now the food is another story to tell; we ordered the Korean Street Tacos, kimchi fried rice, teriyaki salmon and sizzling Asian snapper:  Korean Street Taco was actually really good.  The beef was tender and seasoned nicely; the vegetable dressing was julienne and was perfect and the onion pancake was sized perfectly for this small bite.  The only thing I thought was strange was the pancake.  Most onion pancakes are nice and crispy but this was soft and doughey (probably didn't spell that correctly), but the dressing made up for any strange texture taste that may have come from it.  The only highlight of the meal was the kimchi friend rice.  It was spicy and delicious.  Crunchy and soft!  The teriyaki salmon was good.  It had a nice char-grilled touch to it with the sweet/salty teriyaki.  The disappointment was my sizzling Asian snapper.  There was nothing sizzling about it!  When we hear or read sizzling, we image flavor! Heat! Smoke and hot!  I got none!  The snapper tasted under-cooked, there was no flavor but cilantro and where was this sesame-soy dressing?  I was very disappointed about the flavor or lack of...  Overall experience wasn't pleasant enough for me to want to drive back.  The only suggestion I would advise is, if you're there and we just want something to eat, then sure why not but I would rather go to the buffet and wait...and I don't mean to sound harsh but it is not what I imagine.  Especially if they are going to brag how the chef is a winner on the Food Network show..."}
{"text":"Fresh fish. Reliable. Easy.  The corner of the bar at twilight is the best seat in the house. West facing, sunset, mountain view. Desert sky perfection."}
{"text":"I have now stopped in and eaten here twice in the last week. Both visits have been great. Having watched the show from start to finish, it was nice to see the end product turn out as well as it did. We went yesterday for Christmas dinner and were visited by Chef Seonkyoung who came across as incredibly humble and genuine. I ordered the crab salad (great dish), bibimbap (nice flavors) and Chow Fun Noodles (beef is incredibly tender and noodles are perfectly cooked)  both times. Ice tea is good, hot tea presentation is nice and sake glasses are amazing. The Honey Walnut Prawns were solid with good size and overall portion. In general the pricing on the dishes is very fair. Decor is classy and subtle. Though I like the design of the M overall, there was never a reason to go there on a consistent basis until now. Well done and best of luck."}
{"text":"Very limited menu !  Never going back. I went to a smaller restaurant in Davis , CA , and they offered more selection than Jayde Fusion."}
{"text":"My friend and I were only going to be in Las Vegas for one night -- so we decided to try Jayde Fusion as we had watched Restaurant Express and were impressed by the sincerity and demeanor of Chef Seonkyoung on the show. Boy are we glad we did. From the moment we were seated and throughout the delicious meal everyone was friendly, helpful and seemed to gout of there way to make it a memorable meal. Our server, Jenny, was on top of her game and out entrees literally came out in 10 minutes -- AND the restaurant was packed. The Chow Fun was perfect with in house made noodles; Korean tacos, really good, spicy seafood noodles, fresh and chocked full of shrimp, clams, mussels, lettuce wraps, we should have ordered another plate to take with us! When the bill arrived, we were pleasantly surprised on how reasonable it was. Next time we are in Las Vegas, this is the place we will go -- again."}
{"text":"Beautiful..... delicious.... AYCE menu... ending with a perfect, dreamy Pistachio dessert."}
{"text":"The sushi was fine but it had too much rice. We got the \"all you can eat\". There are restrictions on what you can eat. So make sure you get the right menu. I liked that it was quiet. The employees were nice. I really should of stuck with the usual place. But I was visiting my cousin at the hotel. This hotel is a bit far from anywhere else."}
{"text":"They offer multiple types or all you can eat- either sushi / nigiri or Chinese food specials for $24.95 or both for $32. We did the sushi only, got a hot sake and two beers. Our bill was $83 (not including tip) so with tip it was $100 for mediocre sushi. The rolls are bland, however the nigiri was fresh. The service was excellent- other servers walking by even picked up our plates that we were done with. The atmosphere is hip and trendy. It's just mediocre food."}
{"text":"Great service, pretty good food for ayce.  The chowfun was a little too chewy, and the chowmein was too salty.  But We'll be back.  Very reasonable pricing.  Sake was on the house."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Always great service. We come here once a month with friends or family. Love the sticky ribs. I like to order some of the rolls as a hand roll. Save room for desert!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is excellent. Quality is great. Sean our server awesome! will definitely be back !!!!"}
{"text":"There's a new restaurant with a celebrity chef  at the M Casino/Hotel. Reservations a must for the time being. However none are needed at the back bar, which I actually prefer as you can watch the Executive Chef Seonkyoung Longest, winner of Food Network's Restaurant Express, do her magic. I hear she comes out to chat with the guests at the end of the night, a nice touch as it can make for a memorable evening.   The eye catching hosts are newer and had trouble with seating. The front end managers are pro's, resolved our \"mixup\" quickly with a smile. The food is \"pretty\" and on par with any fusion eateries in Los Angeles, birth place of food mashups. I recommend the Korean Street Tacos, Samgyeopsal lettuce Wraps, Ahi Poke, and Jayde Roll.   I'd stick with the appetizers and sushi as the majority of the main dishes are family style. The large portions easily serves 4 to 6 people, which is strange as most of their seating are for couples. The Kikkoman factory soy sauce bottles, rice bowls that serve as soy sauce plates, and cheap fast food chop sticks seem out of place for a fine dining restaurant.   I would love to see tasting plates, samplers of all the fantastic creations. The server could even explain the food a bit. If you're going to have the winner of Restaurant Express, I figure you'd want to experience everything (much like the judges do).   The new eatery is definitely worth a try, despite having a few things to work out. At the end TV celebrity chefs are just really cool.    Thumbs up, but as always, let me know what you think~"}
{"text":"We came here to meet with our LV friends for dinner. Not our first choice but the sushi place we wanted to go didn't take reservation and we dont want to wait 2 hrs for a table either, so we ended up here.  We all decided to do the AYCE sushi and rolls. We ordered a bunch of stuff! What we liked the most was the ahi dragon roll, ahi nigiri, salmon nigiri, and hamachi nigiri. I wish they had more selection. I'd say the sushi quality is okay, not the worst but not the best either.    Service was fast and friendly. Overall, it was a good dining experience. We were stuffed and for $27 AYCE sushi it was a pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Took 1 hr and 45 minutes for 4 of us. That's extremely slow for even the best steakhouses in town let alone an Asian place. We ordered around 6 items, I ate only one bite from 4 of the dishes. The fried dumplings and pork buns were the best items we had. The sauce that came with the calamari was absolutely horrid. Food was just not good enough for the wait - won't ever be back."}
{"text":"They recently changed their menu to only All You Can Eat. Before you had a regular menu with a lot of options, now it's only AYCE. You have the choice between just sushi, just appetizers or both. One option is around $25 and I think both are about $32.   Since I had been here before when they had a full menu, I'm disappointed because some of the items that I liked are no longer offered. From what made it onto the new menu, it's just decent quality. It's not great but it also isn't horrible. The honey shrimp is pretty good and the pot stickers are yummy. The beef & broccoli is a very small portion and is too salty.    Before the changes, I liked this place. It was affordable and pretty good, plus close to my house. I noticed it was always pretty empty, so maybe the changes are to bring in more people. I think this past visit was my last :("}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area. Only AYCE sit down restaurant in the area. Sushi was fresh, hot foods were delicious. The miso soup is the best I have had. If you like beef you HAVE to get the black pepper steak"}
{"text":"The food here is disgusting.   I literally took a bite and couldn't even make myself stomach it, I had to spit it out into my napkin.   The actual freshness of the raw fish and my waitress are the only good things about this place. It taste like they deep fry their shrimp tempura used for sushi in sesame oil, this in turn makes the rolls taste like pretzels. Their eel sauce taste like burnt soy sauce. With my first bite I was literally shocked that there are people that think that this is what sushi is. It just kept getting worse and worse the mor dishes that arrived. Dishes were not presented as described on the menu.   I want to point out something interesting that I heard screaming from the kitchen- I should note that they have an open kitchen and they have very loud, rude, cursing, and opinionated employees that has zero filter and don't seem to care that they work in an open environment. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. When it arrived, it didn't look very appetizing so I took a spoonful and smelled it. It not only looked like canned dog food, but smelled like it too. After gagging and my husband assuming I was just being dramatic, he encouraged me to try it. I did. I spit it out into my napkin. I have eaten some strange things on the side of the road in 3rd world countries and never spit them out, this I couldn't even fake it with. It literally was dog food.  After we told our server about how awful it is and the plate made it back to the kitchen I heard \"I don't even know why lettuce wraps are even on the menu, they are just a chicken patty rolled out as dog shit, they are just dog shit.\"  I can't make this stuff up.  We paid for our entire bill, no apology, no visit from a manager.   Do not go here, it's awful, it's so significantly over priced."}
{"text":"We had all you can eat sushi and nigiri. It was delicious. The Hawaiian roll and the Orange crush roll were my favorite. The philly roll was good too. There were a lot of saucy and spicy ones on the menu and if I get to go back I'd get more nigiri. The salmon roe was a nice surprise. My husband's favorite was the tuna nigiri."}
{"text":"Came by for dinner to check out the food of the first winner of Food Networks \"Restaurant Express\" and liked most of the meal. We were seated quickly and at first our waiter was like a eagle watching over us. Once the place started to fill in he chilled back with all of that though. Our food came out at different times since we said every dish would be shared. I though that was cool that they would do that so each dish came out hot and fresh and we could have the time to all enjoy and share the dishes instead of having it all at once. The Cashew Chicken was super bomb but not in the spicy kind of way. The menu said it would be spicy but it was definitely sweet instead. I still really liked it but I have to admit that the ones at P.F Chang's are better. I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp and this was my least favorite dish. It was just way too overly sweet. Cashew Chicken is something you should order here. The chicken tasted great and I liked the cashews. Gochujang Pork was supposed to be spicy and wasn't but tasted great. For dessert we had the Yuzu Doughnuts. They came with 5 of them all filled with yuzu cream and drizzed with more. When on this side of town I can see stopping by again."}
{"text":"Was curious of trying this place since the Food Network show \"Restaurant Express\"..  I just wasn't impressed.. Pricey... Friendly staff but a tad bit on the slow side.. Restaurant itself was a cool setup..  What we had : Started off with  - Yuzu Rita! This was a delicious, salted-rim-and-all twist on margarita! - Duck Sliders (roasted Peking duck, vegetables in a bao bun) ; quite tasty! - Samgyeopsal Lettuce Wraps (pork belly, veggies, rice wrapped in lettuce, of course) ; mediocre.. nothing special about the pork belly and WHY THE RICE?? - Pan Fried Dumplings (aka potstickers) ; came out really cold, took a while to get our waitress attention to hopefully get a new one, when it was exchanged... it was ok, I've had better at Panda Express, lol.  Then... - Chicken Fried Skewers ; the chicken was moist and the \"almost\" sweet and sour sauce that came with it was tasty. - Should be called \"Make It Yourself\" Street Tacos - wasn't a fan of having to work for my food, but beef was good and tender. - Rock Shrimp Tempura ; overbreaded, big pieces of shrimp, but was paired with a good sauce. - Crab Salad ; although I did not have a taste of it, I guess the presentation was good - Wonton Soup ; I've had better  Desserts ... - Green Tea Creme Brulee ; presentation could be a lot better, the \"green tea\" was almost brown tea, nonetheless good and not too sweet. - White Chocolate Strawberry Yuzu Mousse ; very pretty but taste was ok..  OVERALL, I'll pass.. Sorry Seonkyung.."}
{"text":"A nice find on the far South end of town. Only open for dinner, it is a beautiful room with shades of green. Excellent for an early dinner with the Sunset out the windows behind the sushi bar.  I usually do the all you can eat sushi option for $25. This is some of the best nigiri sushi around. My favorites include salmon, yellowtail, tuna and albacore. All fresh with large cuts. The sushi rolls are fine -  nothing special with many based on California rolls with a few modifications.  We've also enjoyed ordering off the menu. A good option for groups or those with people who aren't adventurous. Favorites include the Korean Street Tacos and the Honey Walnut Prawns.  Service is usually good. Glasses never get empty and staff is always ready to take your next order. If you get there early or they aren't too busy you can order directly from the chef if you sit at the sushi bar. This is a really comfortable dining room. It never feels crowded and manages to remain casual even though the vibe is upscale."}
{"text":"My first visit impressions of this restaurant were \"OMG I know I'm going to love this place!\" I was already excited when I viewed the menu and saw the mix of Asian fuzed dishes. I didn't follow the tv show Restaurant Express but saw snippets of Chef Longest making some dishes that sounded yummy!   Our first server was also one of the contestants .. Eric??..sorry I didn't watch the show..but he mentioned that he was with Chef Longest on the show. He was very enthusiastic and went over the menu page by page with us. Answered our questions and gave his suggestions as well.   There was a good representation of Korean, Chinese and Japanese inspired offerings. Even the desserts sounded so good! When I saw they had Green Tea Brulee, I told Mr. B I wanted that for dessert!  The prices were really reasonable. Most plates under $10.  The specialty dishes are couple dollars more ie $30 for 1 1/2lb for lobster.  That's heck inexpensive for me..(esp since Im used to paying $$) You cant go wrong with that!    It's tapas style. Small plates meant to be shared so the portions served are just right. So we could easily try all kinds of different dishes. They took our orders and spread out the order  so everything brought to our table was hot, and we got to take our time and pace ourselves since we ordered alot of food.  We ended up having a total of 11 items.   2 Specialties: Korean Style Lobster & Chinese Lemon Chicken 2 Soups & Noodles: Mandarin Beef Noodle Soup & Chow Fun 2 Appetizers: Duck Sliders & Chicken Lettuce Wraps 2 cocktails- Asian inspired with Pomegranate and Watermelon liqueurs 3 desserts --yes three... Strawberry Yuzu White Chocolate Mousse, Banana Egg Rolls, Green Tea Brulee  which was a surprise!  They gave me a complimentary dessert for my birthday! My server heard me saying I wanted it...very attentive!!  The standouts and faves -  The Mandarin Beef Noodle Soup & Korean Style Lobster.  I digged the Lobster dish! You are served the whole shebang! Body, legs,the tail. Sherry Soy was the sauce and  ginger was the prominent flavors I tasted.  It was tossed with some veggies but I didn't really bother with them, I was too busy digging for lobster meat, which was succulent, tasted fresh, high quality. That good!    The broth in the beef noodle soup is delicious! I .loved the herbs and spices in it. The flavors gave the beef broth  alot of depth, I want to say star anise is in it. It was so fragrant. Totally enjoyed the soup and would order it again.   Mr B.s fave was the Chow Fun, I tried some, the beef is really tender. The flavors in all the appetizers we tried we both enjoyed. The only dish I probably would pass up next time is their lemon chicken.  It is very good flavoring wise, but we prefer breading that's more on the crispy side. The breading texture wise, was a little too thick for me.   Desserts - I'd go again with the Strawberry Yuzu White Chocolate Mousse and Green Tea Brulee. These desserts have the right amount of sweetness and are light.  The banana chocolate eggrolls are good as well if you want a more rich, decadent chocolate treat.   Service & Atmosphere -  Very nice set up! A touch of class and elegance, yet casual enough where you don't have to wear formal attire.   Service was OUTSTANDING! From the minute we were greeted at front by the hostess and manager to the team of servers. Reservations were made via Opentable and when we arrived we were seated right away.  I have a  preference noted on my Opentable profile for window seating. The hosts saw that and I was given the table in the VIP area since it was the one with a view available. Very nice too, it's separate from the main dining area.   Also servers were very attentive. When I pointed out to Mr. B. I want to try the Green Tea Brulee for dessert.our server must have heard me since guess what they gave me for my special birthday treat?? Great job there Team Jayde Fuzion!   Best thing I like is this place is pretty reasonable. Enough so, Im adding this culinary destination to our weekly dinner rotation!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this place last night. I read the reviews prior to going and advised against going to her. She insisted we go, get there and a wait of 5-6 minutes. No worries right? We walk in and there is like 3 empty table out of the 15 or so. We opt to sit at sushi bar. I have to say this was the worst teasing sushi I have ever had. It tasted like mush with a fish flavor. That's why you read the reviews!"}
{"text":"You will not find a better deal for your dollar. I went to Nobu for my anniversary last month and I can honestly say the food, atmosphere, and service was better for 1/3 of the price. The chef is so passionate about her food you can taste it in every bite. I am a Vegas local and would recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a great night at a great price. They have 1/3 off of there wine menu and I had a bottle of educated guess for $30!!! The chef who was on restaurant  express took the time to come around and talk to every table. Great night will be back again soon."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and both times it was a great dining experience. The food is just down right awesome. We'll go back many times I'm sure and would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Love love the sushi here."}
{"text":"Great selection and a nice idea of 3 levels of all you can eat. Everything is cooked to order, enough to share with 2 or 3 people. The Korean tacos were fabulous! The fish was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Great quality of fish for the AYCE and their Al La Carte Menu.  Fantastic service and friendly sushi chefs.  All you can eat Uni....What?!?!? Yes Uni, is all you can eat!   I hate all you can eat but decided to try it here and wasn't disappointed.  Update--- This was a 5star review but everything you see in the pictures they don't offer anymore. They changed everything. AVOID AT ALL COST! They don't even have uni anymore."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the 4th time - the food has been consistently good.  The Walnut Prawns, Korean Street Tacos, and the Geisha Roll are my favorites, but we haven't had anything that wasn't good. The menu variety is great because this is a place you can go with a group of friends whether or not everyone likes to eat sushi."}
{"text":"Don't advertise All You Can Eat on billboards and then limit it only to the 9 spots at the bar.  Then day you don't take names on a waiting list. There's no way a party greater than four can be served here... Did not feel welcome"}
{"text":"This place makes horrible rolls. Nigiri was ok. But regardless, I got food poisoning from there.  I got an allergic reaction which is a first for me for sushi.  I waited an hour for my table and only got it when I went back to check on the status. Apparently when I gave him my phone number, they entered 7 digits even though I gave him 10 digits. They must assume that everyone has a 702 area code.  Only locals eat at hotels.  so they called the wrong number.  The hostess was nice enough to make it up by getting a table ready quickly.  The staff was good and efficient.  But not good enough to overcome the badness of the experience overall."}
{"text":"We had a great server and chose the ayce sushi. Was great to try all the menu items. Love the experience and the food!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time at Jayde. First time our service was great! This time EVEN better! My Mom has a seafood allergy and my niece is vegetarian and the waiter, food runner and manager were are very careful about serving them and were SO nice about it! The Honey Walnut Prawns are AMAZING! We'd go just for them! We had a fantastic time!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding had the Mongolian beef, Hawaiian roll and chicken lettuce wrap.  Love the miso soup.  Only issue I had was that the waiter failed to tell us it was all you can eat night would've tried many more rolls. Good food and service"}
{"text":"Amazing food with very friendly service.  We (2 diners) had the Ahi Poke, Korean Street Tacos, Chow Fun Noodles & Korean Spicy Seafood Noodles.  Serving sizes were appropriate and prices great!  The food tasted as good as it looked.  Service, while friendly was a tad slow and disjointed.  Hostesses seemed to care ALOT more about those with reservations than walk-ins.  However, we cannot wait to return to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Service was decent, but nothing amazing. I was told they only had one server. We were patient. Unfortunately, the food was terrible. The sushi roll selection was limited, and 2/2 nigiri we picked were old. One felt hard and the other was oddly bright and rubbery, like it was pumped with a bunch of dye. I've had great sushi, and this was a total turn off. Smaller problems were that the booths that could accommodate about four people barely had tables big enough to hold a few plates for two people. It was an issue trying to puzzle plates together the whole time. All in all, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas this is where we always stop in for some sushi/fusion..  Love this place it's very good for all you can eat sushi for the price I highly recommend this place...  5/5 *..!!"}
{"text":"The reviews for this restaurant are mixed, and I can understand why. We had a rather large party (15, I believe), for a birthday dinner. The restaurant is beautiful, and we were seated in a lovely private room. I realize that it may have been a bit confusing that some of us ordered the all you can eat sushi and some didn't, but things were rather inconsistent, items were missed (with a rather nonchalant attitude by the server when we pointed it out). The sushi in general lacked flavor, and the drink I ordered (the ginger martini) was just plain bad- it had a cough syrup taste. The server forgot that everyone who ordered the AYCE was supposed to get sake, so that didn't come out until the very end of the meal.  Not my favorite sushi experience, unfortunately."}
{"text":"My bf and I discovered Jayde Fuzion while we were at M resort one evening. What a great surprise! Normally I don't like \"all you can eat\" and buffet type places but Jayde looked like a beautiful high end hotel restaurant and the menu was straight forward and looked great. We both chose the set sushi option and went to town. It had been a while since I had good sushi and I was blown away by what we got. You definitely get way more than you pay for in quality and quantity. I highly recommend Jayde Fuzion for your sushi / Asian fix, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I'm probably like most of you.  I read the reviews of this place, mostly bad or mediocre at best, but decided to come anyway because (1) it's all you can eat sushi and sake for $24.99!!, and (2) how bad could sushi at a nice resort from a Food Network chef actually be???  Came here on a Wednesday night at 7pm and the place was empty, which should have been my first clue that I needed to run and run FAST, but we stayed anyway.  Things you should know if you are considering this crappy restaurant:  First, the \"all you can eat sushi\" only includes about 6 rolls and 5 nigiri options.  And of the 6 rolls, 3 are almost identical to one another in composition.  The fish is mediocre in quality and the rolls themselves were damn near inedible.  Second, the sake is the bottom of the barrel crap that I wouldn't pour my worst enemy.  It's almost undrinkable it's that bad.  Third, the service bites big time.  We were given our drinks (barely, after 15 minutes of waiting) and never saw the guy again until it was time for our check.  Another minor irritation was that I was charged $11 for my glass of wine.  No wine list, so I just ordered the house red, but of course I was upcharged for something fancy.  I gave one extra star for the view, which is nice.  Otherwise this place isn't worth the space in the casino, don't waste your time.  PS, if you're looking for a good deal on sushi Monday-Wednesday drive down the road to Island Sushi for their 50% off ALL rolls.  Their sushi is amazing and well worth the money and you can get plenty for $24.99 a person."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to Jayde Fuzion since seeing the Food Network show that chose the head chef.  The winner of that contest has already departed, but M Resort has kept Jayde around.  Jayde has recently started an all-you-can-eat sushi option for Sunday-Thursday, so we decided to give this a shot.  First things first.  The AYCE option is only available at the sushi bar - which only seats 11.  We expected to walk up and sit down on a sunday evening.  Hold it right there.  Do we want to be added to the waiting list?  Who knew there would be a 90 minute wait on a sunday.  We toughed it out and were rewarded with a much shorter 35 minute wait.  When you order the AYCE option you are given a bowl of miso soup and a carafe of sake.  You fill out a slip to give to your server or you can order directly from the chefs.  One downside - no sashimi orders.  Only rolls and nigiri.  Another downside is the variety of rolls to order.  Places like Yama or Kaizen have 30+ rolls to choose from in all varieties of wackiness.  Jayde has about 10 and they're all pretty standard.  One of the standout rolls was the humble california roll.  At this point we're so used to having average california rolls that getting a good one really took us by surprise.  Another tasty surprise was the Surf & Turf roll - a spicy tuna roll with seared kobe on top.  One major negative of this roll is that the kobe was seared on the roll with a blowtorch and you can definitely taste the butane flavor.  Not overly appetizing.  I can't speak to the regular menu at Jayde Fuzion, but the all-you-can-eat sushi option is amazing.  Extremely high quality ingredients in a room with a killer view.  Free soup and sake.  All for $25.  You really can't go wrong, as long as make sure to get your name on the waiting list."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner for 4 and took almost 2 hours.  Most the dishes were just avg to poor with the Tempura being the best dish.  Stay away from this place for a few mos until they get their act together."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since we always pass by the billboard on the 15 when we are headed out of town and I always read it as Jay de Fuzion and my husband's name is very similar to it.  Anyway, finally made it in for dinner.    Overall it was fine.  Service was good, the atmosphere is good.  I like how the table spacing is nice and big/roomy, not so close together.  The food was okay.  My favorite thing from what we ordered was the duck rolls.  We also got the Thai Basil Fried Rice which was good, but not as flavorful as I have had at other restaurants.  Same with the street noodles.  Maybe it's just me, I like extra flavor, extra salty.  Once I added some soy sauce, it tasted much better.  We also got the Beef Broccoli and the Jayde sushi roll.  I wouldn't come here for sushi as the roll was small and nothing special.  I feel like there are so many other great sushi places if you need a sushi fix.  I would come here if I was staying at the M, craving chinese/asian food.  Don't think I would drive out of the way to come back.  Like I said if I was staying the night or doing a pool or spa day at the M, I would go back as it was fine, decent food, however not anything that stands out to be a fan.  Oh and for dessert had the chocolate banana egg rolls.  I just wasn't a huge fan.  I am used to having friend banana egg rolls where there are big pieces of banana in them.  This one tasted more like a banana filling, so too mooshy for my liking of a fried banana egg roll."}
{"text":"My hubs and I came here on a date night, a Saturday to be exact and it wasn't really that busy.   We checked in and had to wait a few minutes.  No biggie.   We were put at a table for two right by the main kitchen artery. i.e. all the servers walked past us with the dirty dishes. Not wonderful.   We decided we were going to experiment with our order a bit, ya know, try a little of as much as we could.  Of the signature dishes we ordered the Samgyeopsal Lettuce wraps which we were told by our fantastic waiter (Eric) was one of the dishes that helped the chef win the show.  Also, we ordered Edamame and Steamed BBQ pork buns.  The Lettuce wraps were labeled as spicy.  We got no spice.  They were rather bland and really just like any off the market lettuce wraps.  Now, the steamed BBQ pork buns were just horrid.  There was a load of bun and almost no pork filling.  Disappointing.   For our main course we were going to go with the Gochujang Pork but after the disappointing appetizers we decided we would go with the easier choice of Beef and Broccoli and ordered a Jayde Roll off the sushi menu.  The Jayde roll was just fantastic!! Nummy nummy!  The Beef and Broccoli was going along with the rest of the night, bland and really no flavor. Seriously, you would think they couldn't ruin a signature asian dish but yeppers they did.   I give this place two stars because the service from Eric was just outstanding.  He checked on us regularly, kept our tea and soda filled up and was just an all around nice guy.  We of course will not be going back.  It was too expensive to have to deal with bland and boring."}
{"text":"Didn't see the show but when I heard the story I figured it would be worth it to check out something new.     Reservation was easy thru open table and the host staff greeted me warmly and sat me before the rest of my party arrived.  Its a big location and has a good layout with the bar to the front surrounded by glass encased wine cellar.  Down a couple steps the main dining room is completely open with plenty of tables and a sushi bar in the corner.    The server approached me quickly and got my drink order (iced tea) promptly and to my relief the glass was a very good size (big) so I didn't have to constantly ask for refills.  Even better they topped me off multiple times and brought a fresh glass when the ice melted.  The food is best described as shareable tapas of Asian decent.  The street tacos were very good and I'd highly recommend the duck sliders.  Just check with server on portions because some ( like the sliders) were smaller ( 2 per order) vs the others.  The sliders were my favorite with a classic street sandwich bread to go along well cooked and marinated duck and fresh herbs and veg.  A close second was the s&p (salt and pepper) calamari tempura.  Crispy, not oily, and goes great with the spicy pepper slices and soy based dipping sauce.  The chow fun noodles and the pork dish was a great way to round out the meal.  The main dishes are plenty to share ( 3 of us split the 2 dishes after the small plates).    The yuzu donuts were great donut holes with a yuzu cream that was very flavorful without being overly sweet.  The staff was all very attentive and the chef took time to greet us and ask how the meal was.  She was very personable and friendly.  The whole operation seems very well run for a place that just opened.  The manager wished us a good night on the way out, shook our hands (nice firm grip thank god) and invited us back again soon and said he hoped they did enough for us to become regulars (they did).  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"After seeing this all the positive reviews and beautiful pictures on here I knew that I absolutely needed to try this place out. I went with 3 other people and we ordered a couple of things. WE made reservations so we got a comfortable booth near the kitchen and got to see Seonkyoung work. She was very friendly and came out to occasionally greet guests or take pictures with them. The service seemed a bit hectic though. Our waiter hinted that they were a bit overworked and understaffed and everyone seemed to be running around (2 people dropped a trays full of dishes).  And for some reason they kept constantly changing out our plates and chopsticks, even when they were cleaned. They probably replaced our dishes 5 times throughout the meal o__O But besides that everyone was courteous and friendly. The food is a bit pricier than the average Korean restaurant, about $5-$10 more. The presentation was BEAUTIFUL and everything looked amazing. BUT I just thought the food was okay. It really lacked the spice or kick that Korean food usually has. A few dishes were REALLY good like the crab salad, the sashimi, and the lobster. But most of our dishes weren't really up to our expectations. NOW I DIDN'T say that it was bad. It was good but for the price that we paid I felt that I should have been so much better. Edamame had no flavor, Japachae noodles weren't boiled long enough, caesar salad was a bit dry and there was hardly any kimchi in the kimchi fried rice. They forgot one of my dishes but quickly made it for me and took it off the bill. And when we first had our lobster it was SALTY. SO SALTY. (and we love salt but it was TOO MUCH). But they remade it and it tasted better. But the desserts were DELICIOUS. The green tea creme brulee tasted great and the Yuzu donuts were perfect and not overly sweet with just the right amount of filling. MaybeI'll come back again in a month or two but it seems like maybe they need some more time to get things organized."}
{"text":"Jayde Fusion has a new menu, keeping some of their former specialities and adding some new ones. All are delicious. Miss the shrimp tempura, however, and hope to see it on the menu again in the future. Service is always excellent."}

{"text":"This is our favorite dining place. Chef Fon always makes our salmon dish excellent. She's very accommodating to our request every time we go there, very nice person and the rest of the staff are nice as well. We're very pleased with the service."}
{"text":"We were excited to try out Jayde Fuzion after watching Seonkyoung win on Restaurant Express.  I was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant actually opened being that it seems that a lot of winners on the other chef shows turn down the jobs that they win. So Hooray for Seonkyoung!!  We were very happy for her and met her while we waited for our food.  She's so sweet and humble, just like she was on the show =)  We plan to come back often even though we live in Summerlin which is quite a hike for us.    Okay to the menu:  My husband and I tried the lettuce wraps, crab salad, duck sliders, bibimbap, Korean seafood noodle soup, and 2 orders of the Korean bbq ribs.  We were stuffed by the time we left but it's because we ordered so much food.  I felt like a few of the dishes were a little small for the price and I was torn between giving 4 or 5 stars because a few of the dishes were absolutely incredibly, but the second order of ribs we had didn't have the nice, crispy char that the first order had.  The lettuce wraps were delicious just slightly too oily, however, I prefer the butter lettuce that it came with, unlike most places that serve it with the cheap ice berg lettuce.  The bibimbap was tasty and I really liked the sauce it came with but we were a little sad that it didn't come in a hot stone pot and it was a little on the small side =(    The crab salad was to die for, as well as the first order of bbq ribs and Korean seafood noodle soup!  I told Seonkyoung how much I love spicy food, and she had the chef make mine extra, extra, extra spicy.  My husband loved the duck sliders and wanted more even though he was overly stuffed, haha.  We can't wait to come back and bring our friends!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for Valentine's Day. We got there early, but they wouldn't seat us until our reservation time since it was so busy so we decided to go to the bar and have a drink while we waited. The drinks were $10-13. When we finally got seated, we were quickly greeted. We had already been looking at the menu so we knew what we wanted to start with. You have the option of ayce sushi, all you can eat jayde specials or if you pay a little more, you can get both. Since it was Valentine's day, we decided to try both. The sushi was ok, but I've had a lot better and they don't give you a very big selection. I probably wouldn't go for the sushi again. But I did enjoy the jayde specials. The honey walnut prawns were my favorite, absolutely delicious. I would recommend the ayce jayde specials, but that's it. The service was fantastic tho. We had most of our food within minutes of ordering it, when the place was packed."}
{"text":"Frankly, what impresses me most about Jayde Fuzion is the excellent service. Oh sure, the Korean street tacos are great, as is the fried rice (yes, it is freakin' GREAT!), but what really makes this restaurant a must-revisit-often is the sterling service from everyone. So... go for the service, stay for the food.  One last thing: I've been to plenty of sushi and Chinese restaurants that charged me much more and gave me far less than Jayde Fuzion.  Okay? Is that enough? You're still here! What is it with you?! Go! Eat!"}
{"text":"Service was slow but amiable. Bad tasting rice, uneven cuts, limited selection, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I feel like if you're going to offer AYCE you should not restrict it to the bar. Be an AYCE place or don't. I made a reservation to sit at the bar knowing that you could only participate there. They do not have it stated anywhere on their opentable that reservations aren't accepted for the bar. I was told I had to wait an hour by a hostess with a somewhat snippy attitude. I understand I suppose. I used to be a hostess at an AYCE place and it was terrible. But regardless update your opentable to say there's no reservations at the bar."}
{"text":"Cant say enough good thing's about this restaurant.  The selection of specialty items is amazing. We tried orange chicken, Mongolian beef, pho, sticky ribs, crab Rangoon, pot stickers and beef street tacos. The the street tacos are amazing."}
{"text":"I painfully give 3 stars to Jayde Fuzion because I had such high hopes for this place. Dinner for two with two appetizers and two entrees cost 57 dollars. As an asian person the flavors weren't really there. It catered more to white people. I can't say I loved anything I ordered, everything was just okay. Its not worth driving all the way south to the M resort from the center of town. In her defense, its mostly white people dining at the M resort so her flavors are spot on for them. Just not for asians."}
{"text":"When this place opened, it was a revelation. Reconfirmed the power of food network tv. Dishes were bursting with flavor and this was fusion at its best based on my native cuisine, korean food!   One taste of seonkyong's kimchi I was in heaven.   Alas that only lasted for a few months and since seonkyong left it is a high priced casino restaurant with mediocre food and run by idiots who simply do not care. I'm just glad I got to enjoy seonkyong's brilliant cuisine when she was there."}
{"text":"I'd say that after you visit Anthony's Steak House for happy hour, then it is definitely worth checking out Jayde Fuzion.    My gf and I are both vegetarian and there isn't a ton of stuff on the menu that looked like it would work, but they were very accommodating in de-meating our meals.  There were four of us and we were starving after waiting for 2hrs! for the M buffet and then giving up.  I'm glad we did though because the food here was better and similarly priced.  I had tofu lettuce wraps (eh), Korean Japchae (really good sweet potato noodle dish), kimchi fried rice (yum), shrimp and vegetable tempura (decent), chow mein (I thought this was particularly good and the noodles had a nice bite to them), and some Emperor fried rice with xo sauce and crab meat.  The fried rice never came out and we didn't realize until the end of the meal.  They apologized and ended up giving it to us for free togo.  The next morning I went to town on that stuff and it was my favorite dish.  Summary, get the Emperor fried rice and chow mein and you won't be disappointed.  Feel free to ask for veggie options."}
{"text":"Went here two weeks ago with another couple, excited to try it since its been here a while and I hadn't made it over.  I could have waited longer.  So the name says Fuzion aka fusion, but not sure what is fused together. They have a Japanese menu with sushi selections and other popular Japanese food, and then on the other side of the menu is Chinese food selections. You can order either Chinese food or order Japanese food OR... you can order off of both sides of the menu (there's your fusion) even though the entrees do not have any combination of two foods.  The sushi was tasty. The Chinese food was ok. We've had better. The service was poor. We were asked when we sat down if we would like a drink and that was the first and last time. Too bad, lost some money there. I'm assuming the bus boy is told to clear dishes asap so they can turn more tables, because some of the dishes got cleared before we even finished.  Way more places in Vegas to enjoy Japanese or Chinese food. I'll stick with them."}
{"text":"They have some pretty crispy buzz worthy wings on their appetizer menu, which in my opinion is top shelf important information and deserves four stars. From years of experience I've learned that a good chicken wing can cure the blues (or a post thanksgiving hangover hosted at your house with the divorced in laws in attendance ). We ordered some drinks,obviously, and one of them was this lemon style martini. The glass was really cool, it looked like a martini glass inside a tall glass. The actual drink was awful (not everything can have inner beauty) tasted like that medicine the doc prescribes when you have strep throat mixed with horse radish. That for me wasn't a deal breaker though because I can imagine some bitter old cat women potentially enjoying that drink, just didn't cut it for my high brow taste buds. The chicken lettuce wraps were good, but I mean how much can one really expect out of a chicken lettuce wrap ya know? They cure hunger, they do their thing, bravo. The other people I was with ordered some sushi and literally inhaled it. I'm not sure if they loved it because they're the type of guys that would eat garbage if it had a good sauce drizzled on top. I can say that the presentation was nice and it looked enjoyable. Oh ya, the server told us that the ramen was gross there so I'd advise you to steer clear. Tip-Half off all appetizers on certain days at the bar. There was a sign with the info but I only had a few active brain cells at the time so it wasn't lasting information.The food was good. You might as well try it. I can tell you've already watched everything on Netflix so just get off the couch and go enjoy a local happy hour will ya?"}
{"text":"Ok so when I crave food it isn't usually Asian except for sushi! so when it was suggested we come here for a birthday celebration, I was in as I like trying new places and was excited as who doesn't watch the food network competitions these days and not know of this place, but I wasn't craving the food.  Lets just say the place impressed me.   The chef herself came out, explained her story, her dishes and talked to us and wished us happy birthday, she also came back around and personally checked on us and our food later with more conversation.  Jenny was an amazing waitress and her support staff was just as wonderful.  People had a sense of humor and it definitely added to the ambiance of the place.   The food: we basically went tapas with it and nobody ended up ordering sushi.  We had the crab salad (chef recommended), pork buns, duck sliders, street tacos and kimchi to start. We all shared and we all had different favorites.  I really liked the crab salad, it was light and fresh with good ceviche style flavors.  The pork buns were also delicious but the only criticism for any of those dishes is that we wanted more meat in the buns in balance with the proportion of dough.  The kimchi was good, never had with pork in it but it wasn't too spicy, maybe a little more kick would have been.   Main courses we got the ahi poke, chow fun, teryiaki salmon, lettuce wraps and egg rolls.  Again we all had different favorites but they were all seasoned wonderfully with good flavor.  The lettuce wraps almost seemed pureed though and I wasn't a big fan.  The sauces all came on the side and they all had a nice kick and added more depth to all the dishes.   For dessert we got the yuzu donuts and the chocolate banana egg rolls.  We were split which we liked better.  The donuts had that light citrus flavor and weren't heavy, more like a puff than a donut.  They had good flavor if you like yuzu and the serving is definitely more than enough to share.  the egg rolls were great with a nice chocolate and banana balance with a bit of crunch from the egg roll wrapper.   The whole meal was super delicious but because of small criticisms subtracted one star.  But overall I think chef has done a great job and we would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding... Chris was our waiter and was super kind and attentive. Chris could see that we werent totally impressed by the sushi and offered food from the other menu but we were fine. Brought the cheif out to speak with us who again was outstanding with her customer service. Even though we didnt think it was the best we have ever had we will be coming back to try the other menu items. When you care about your customers as they do It's worth another try!!"}
{"text":"Went with a buddy to check out the AYCE.  You must sit at the sushi bar for AYCE.  The menu is very limited compared to most AYCE places in the valley.  They do have some appetizers that other places do not - like steamed pork buns!  The fish was very fresh and the staff was courteous.  The few rolls they did have were average at best - we tried 5 rolls between us, and didn't find any that we had to have again.  Even the nigiri sushi selection was limited.  Neither of us felt the menu was special enough to come back."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place only has 3 stars. It was so good! We were originally going to go for the ayce sushi but there was an hour wait. So glad we ordered from the regular menu instead! My fave appetizers were the Korean tacos and the duck sliders! So yummy. The duck sliders are a little pricey tho, about $6 per. But for me, it was worth it! The kimchi fried rice and the filet medallions were the highlights of the meal. Didn't get to try dessert because I was so full. Next time!"}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to eating here since we're from the local area and love the M but it was a huge disappointment.    The service was TERRIBLY slow, the food was bland and the sushi bar blocks the best view of the strip.  After being seated, we waited almost 20 minutes just to order drinks.  When our order arrived, the waiter spilled my martini on my Coach purse.  The waiter apologized and said he'd be right back with something to clean it up.  No big deal, accidents happen.  However, it took 10 (!!!!) minutes for him to bring a napkin & selzer water.  They didn't even comp the drink despite half of it being spilled on my purse!!    The rest of the night pretty much followed suit...we ordered the street taco appetizer, a plate of the ribs (a specialty of the chef apparently) and 2 entrees.  The app came out right away and was tasty but a little cold.  Then the ribs followed quickly and were also pretty good.  But after that, things went downhill again.  It took almost 30 minutes to get the beef & noodle dish my husband ordered.  It wasn't even anything special--just noodles with marinated beef strips.  Then almost another 20 minutes after hi meal arrived for snapper I ordered to show up.  The snapper had no flavor.  Very disappointing!  Over 2 hours later we still weren't out of there.  But this isn't one of those fancy restaurants where you should take your time and a meal should take 2 hours...this was just pure delay by the staff (kitchen or wait staff, we're not sure) and poor service.  The M has much better choices...save your money & time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices! We even got to meet the signature chef! Went there to celebrate my birthday!"}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi bar for $24 is well worth it! Delicious big rolls with excellent flavor. Service was excellent. Free saki with the meal!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi places, and this may have been one of the more disappointing ones. Maybe it's because my family and I had high expectations, but the setting and vibe you get from just looking at the restaurant can't let you think anything less of it. As it turns out, it was kind of the opposite.   There are three different AYCE menus: sushi & nigiri, Jayde Fuzion specialties (lemon chicken, lettuce wraps, gyoza, etc.), and then sushi, nigiri & specialties all in one. Four out of five of us at the table chose the sushi & nigiri menu, and we all agreed on one thing - the texture and quality of the rice for the rolls was WAY different than the rice for the nigiri, and not in a good way. It was mushy and undercooked at the same time. It stuck to the top of the roof of your mouth when you chewed it, and it was unappetizing after one or two pieces. Bottom line, we couldn't stomach them. We asked our server why there was a difference with the rice, and the answer to our question after he consulted with the chefs was that there was more rice vinegar at the roll station in comparison to the one placed at the nigiri station.   In our opinion, the nigiri rice was the consistency it was supposed to be. They made a roll with the nigiri rice to see if it would make a difference to us, and of course, it did. It was the way we all thought it SHOULD be, but as I said, our appetites were already lost.  Thankfully, our servers were so considerate and understanding. They offered if we would like to switch to the specialties menu due to our dissatisfaction, they informed the chefs about the rice, and apologized for any inconvenience. I must say the specialties menu was much better than the sushi & nigiri. The fried rice, honey walnut prawns and lettuce wraps were good and dessert did the job.  Originally, I was going to give this place only one star, but customer service pleased my family and I, which is the reason I gave it two instead. Yes, food is the primary concern here, but bad service can throw that out of the window even if the food was amazing. I would've given three if at least one of our meals were comp'd, but oh well.  All in all, I've experienced better. Give it a try, because every place is worth that much. Hopefully after our comments, the rolls will get better."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best. I have eaten at different sushi and Chinese/Asian restaurants but I have never thought how great of idea of combining the two. I know the pricing is on the higher end. But when in Vegas most things cost more. I'm happy to say that i am willing to pay the extra price because the service and ambiance is top notch. Service staff is trained and meets all the customer demands. Our waiter, Raymond, was friendly and was glad to meet all of our needs. All you can eat with out that buffet feel. Make sure to ask for the honey candy walnut."}
{"text":"I have wanted to come here since I saw Jade win on the Food Network,  but I am disappointed.  Maybe what I ordered wasn't a special enough dish.  I had hot and sour soup,  it was mediocre.  The service was also not outstanding.  Perhaps I have to try a different dish to be impressed.  Maybe I will give it one more try."}
{"text":"We went here again on Christmas for the second time and it did not disappoint.  Our service was great and the food was awesome and it just kept coming."}
{"text":"Their appetizers are delicious but their nigiris are mostly rice. We always go to AYCE in LV and the amount of rice here is way too much! Their miso soup, tempura, bao and Vietnamese rolls are tasty. We asked for green tea and it was a tea bag and we kept on asking for hot water to refill it. They also don't clear the tables after the small dishes. They let them pile up and just keep bringing in your orders. We didn't have space anymore and there were only 2 of us on a table for 4. The service was ok but it was kinda snobbish feel. The signs on the freeway made us try it but that was our first and last. Sorry."}
{"text":"This review is for AYCE Jayde specialties menu only. My sweets and I ate here while staying at the M and we will never eat here again.  We are not fans at all.  This was probably the saddest dining experience I have ever had.  The service was fine but the cocktails and food were very disappointing.  I was excited for the all you can eat since the menu sounded great with some yummy options.  The portions were huge which I did not expect or want.  I was hoping for small plates so I could try a few different items.  By the time I ate my first appetizer I was full.  Here is what we tried.....  -Shrimp Tempura-nothing special and the batter was hard, I can make better tempura at home  -Chicken Lettuce cups-no spices at all and the chicken was watery...........sooooooo bland  -Chow fun noodles-sauce was ok but lacked basil. The beef was poor quality and reminded us of dog food!!!! It was disgusting.  -Chow Mein-ok  -Beef with broccoli-again, the beef tasted like dog food.  I would have given this place one star but we did not try the sushi.  Maybe that is the reason this place has 3 stars."}
{"text":"Don't believe the bad reviews. If you notice they don't ever mentioned bad food quality. I eat here every Wednesday and have never had a bad experience. Every visitor I've brought here has loved it. Yes, it's Americanized, but the preparation as well as service is solid. If you want customized sushi, sit at the bar. They will accommodate your special request at the tables as well. It is better to come here with a group of four or more so everyone can share and that way you can try more of the selection. When my wife and I come we either get the sushi or we get the appetizers. When we come with friends we all get the fusion so we can share everything. All the food is extremely fresh and for $25 a person you cannot beat the value."}
{"text":"Asian fusion tapas is how I would best describe Jayde Fuzion and Seonkyoung, the new Food Network star surely delivered with her culinary vision and concepts!  My advice is to go in a group of 4 and order a bunch of dishes and share.   We loved the Crab Salad - I believe this was one of the dishes featured in the early episode of Restaurant Express.  The salad was so fresh, light and refreshing.  The crab salad is paired with these lettuce endives and sesame wonton chips to scoop the crab goodness up.  This was one of our favorites.  You can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps stuffed with pork belly....YES....pork belly.  Next time I will get the Duck sliders and Korean street tacos as we saw many tables having these dishes.    There are many traditional Korean dishes such as Japchae and Kalbi and for less adventurous eaters you can order a cashew chicken.  There's an even a full blown sushi bar.    There's definitely something for everyone.   The best part is most entrees are in the $8 to $15 range so you can order several and share.  Be sure to save room for desserts.  We really enjoyed the Yuzu Donuts - I could eat a dozen of those.  Hopefully chef will bring her famous sticky Asian bbq Ribs.  If you're in the area, be sure to check out this new Asian gem at the M Resort."}
{"text":"All you can eat menu is a great value. I ordered the sushi and nigiri. My husband had the jayde specialties (Cantonese). The sushi roll choices are a bit limited and best I could tell they have a group of sushi chefs continually churning out rolls so you don't have to wait long. We got right in, no wait on a Friday night. Our server was knowledgable and very pleasant. Decor is nice too. Portions are generous. For an all-you-can-eat menu I would almost prefer smaller dishes so I have an opportunity to sample more items.  Kids under 5 eat free! Ages 5-12 are half off."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sushi spot in Vegas so far. Quality of the fish is excellent and each of their dishes I have tried are delicious. The ambiance is very nice and is great for date nights or just lunch with friends. Service was also on point. The menu consists of 3 different types of all-you-can-eat choices, which I can't remember off the top my head!   Check em out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with our experience. The food was absolutely amazing, wonderful flavor, and presentation. Also very pleased with the service of the staff, everyone was very nice and helpful, esp coming from someone who works in the service industry I can 100% say we enjoyed our experience. We will be back! Thank you !"}
{"text":"Went here last night for AYCE at the sushi bar. I was originally going to order ramen and our waiter was pretty adamant that it was not good and instead recommended other soups for me to try. I've had waiters recommend different items before, but none had ever been so blatant as this guy. I appreciated his opinion yet at the same time felt it was incredibly strange being warned not to order a specific dish. So I took his advice and opted for the AYCE sushi.  We enjoyed their AYCE menu. The various appetizers, nigiri, and two rolls we ordered were all quite good. Both the sushi and nigiri were rather large, meaning big individual pieces with a lot of rice. I tend to prefer smaller pieces so that I can try a larger variety of items rather than getting full so easily on larger portions.  Another tiny negative was that we had to wait a few minutes for the hostess to appear. Obviously it is quite normal to have to wait for your table, but someone should always be up front to take your name down or at least greet you. I don't think I've ever seen a dine-in restaurant with a completely empty hostess stand before and just found it very unusual.  I thought the food and atmosphere overall was nice, but something about the experience was just a bit off. I personally had a good time, so I'm not sure to be honest. But I would be happy to come here again and give the a la carte menu a try (prices look pretty good)."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since its opening & we were very disappointed with the new changes. My husband & I live within minutes & have enjoyed coming for drinks, an appetizer, & sharing an entree. Now it's all you can eat for $25+taxes for anything.  There is no longer an option to order individual items. We can't eat that much &, from the looks of the empty restaurant at 6:30 on a Friday night, others agree.  Too bad - we won't be back."}
{"text":"My Cousin recommended this place to have dinner, we haven't seen each other for a long while, but we are always wanting to try new restaurants when we have our moments to reconnect and share about what's going on with our lives currently.  She's also good friends with one of the chefs. Customer service wise : from the hostess to our waiter was excellent! Very attentive and knowledgeable of all the food offerings displayed on the very quaint menu books.  The menu itself is basic and simple but our waiter Alex was knowledgable about every item we inquired about.  Drinks were served In a timely manner, and we placed our order shortly after. I assumed that we arrived early enough before the dinner crowd arrived that our dining experience happened so flawlessly.  When our food arrived, the lounge started to populate. We assumed we dined at a great time.  The food was beyond amazing, plated wonderfully, eye appealing, and full of flavor.  I would recommend this place as a meet and greet or a time to have an intimate meal with conversation - not a place for a family for the reason that the menu emanates \"Ala Carte\".    :)"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant at the M Resort.  Excellent, friendly, attentive service.  Good sushi, especially for an AYCE place.  EXCELLENT non-sushi food. The Korean Street Tacos were truly sublime.  Very reasonable prices as well. There's not many places in Vegas two people can have a dinner that large with booze for under $80."}
{"text":"So after months spent bookmarked on my yelp. I finally made it to seonkyoungs restaurant. Ambiance is modern upscale yet casual friendly. Crowd was a lil more of the mature side. I came in with my fiancé and son but nonetheless we didn't care lol. Now lets talk food & service.   We ordered a lot of things so I might not remember all.   -dumplings: came out cold so I sent it back and got better ones. They are ok. -duck sliders: super yummy! I can eat 10 of these. -rock shrimp: it was good tempura shrimp but just a tad much on the breading.  -Korean tacos: eh. comes deconstructed. I had better.  -lettuce wraps: not enough pork belly and why put rice in it? It's a lettuce wrap.. -fried chicken skewers: these are perfectly cooked tenders w a nice sweet n spicy sauce.  -wonton soup: normal. -blue fin tuna nigiris & toro sashimi: I like the generous portion of the nigiri. The toro sashimi wasn't cut of restaurant quality and the fish didn't taste fresh.  -yuzu ritas: delicious rendition of a margarita. Try it!  -green tea brûlée: it was very good but needs help on presentation. -white chocolate strawberry yuzu mousse: pretty unique dessert & beautiful plating.   Service was friendly but slow.   Some of the dishes are good but majority of it is forgettable. Nothing is screaming at me \"come back\"."}
{"text":"Service good and they make an effort to cater to your needs but when they are busy it can get chaotic and there can be waits. As for their all you can eat menu - they have a very limited selection even with the different options. We did prefer the side dishes vs the actual sushi."}
{"text":"After our first experience we were invited back by the chef. We tried it again and my, what a difference!  We received exceptional service and the fish was the highest quality AYCE sashimi I have ever had. The sashimi alone was worth the price tag. I would highly recommend this restaurant fortheit sushi, sashimi, or any of their other offerings. Their customer service was amazing and the quality of the food was exceptional!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here last night, I wanted to try this since it opened.  We had a 6PM reservation and showed up early...no problems.  They seated us at a table for two and suggested a few menu items.  They also told us wine was 1/3 off for bottles, so we got a bottle of sav blanc for only 23 dollars.  We ordered the Korean tacos, Kalbi ribs and Chow fun.  We have been to Korea, and this was spot on!  Hubby loved his chow fun, and I enjoyed the kalbi....the Korean tacos were a little cold, but they still tasted very good with fresh veggies and the sauce.  Probably the only reason I am not giving this place five stars.  Our waiter was just fantastic, and he allowed us to take our wine onto the floor after dinner in their nice wine glasses.  We love the M casino and now we know about this gem....will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I really like this place when I'm starving. The ability to get sushi and other foods is awesome. They have a great plum wine you should try!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Rolls were filling & tasty & nigiri was fresh. There was no line to eat, unlike studio B, which is where we were heading. We are sushi eaters, so coming here was a fantastic alternative. The ambiance was cool & romantic. The staff was helpful, friendly, & quick. Plus, we got hot sake & it was good.  A strange complaint would be the chop sticks literally gave me a splinter. I mentioned this to the waiter & he explained they had ran out & had to use a lower quality utensil. Which is completely understandable. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The all you can eat hot and cold option is a great deal. Food is really good and service is usually pretty good too. My fave is the korean street tacos and the walnut shrimp. On some occasions they even have an off the menu item that they will offer at no additional charge...last time I was there it was a whole fish Thai style. The only thing that I would add is you get free sake with some of the special all you can eat dinners but often you have to ask them or they do not bring it. So just ask."}
{"text":"Very poor quality of sushi. Don't bother. The options were not exciting, and the quality is not worth it. Better off at Studio B."}
{"text":"After doing some shopping, hubby and I decided on coming here to Jayde Fuzion for dinner. We didn't leave hungry! We were greeted with a warm welcome and our server was fast as we sat at the table to get our drink order. The service was excellent here. Our drinks never went empty and our server answered all of our questions.  The menu is very simple without having a ton of items on it, but it was still hard to decide was to order since it all looked so good. The prices are also very reasonable. We decided to get different items from the menu and just share it.   Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($8) - These were pretty good. I personally prefer a crunchier lettuce, but it was good. The menu said this dish was spicy however there wasn't any kick to the dish all. The chicken still had good flavor and it is worth the price. It came with 3 lettuce cups and when I asked our server for more it was no problem.  Cashew Chicken ($15) - My favorite dish of them all! It was a great portion of chicken and put over white rice it was perfect. There were plenty of cashews and this is a dish I would probably order every time.   Gochujang Pork ($15) - Apples are in this dish, but I didn't taste them. That's OK because whatever flavor it did give the pork, I loved! I will say that this was also supposed to be a spicy dish and there was again no kick at all. It's sort of frustrating when a dish says it will be spicy and it isn't, but it did have great flavor and I would eat it again. As with the other dishes it was a decent portion.   Honey Walnut Shrimp ($18) - I don't eat seafood. I didn't try these! The menu says it was supposed to have a creamy mayo sauce, but hubby said the shrimp tasted more like a really sweet orange and wouldn't order them again. I thought they were presented well and nicely sized.   Yuzu Doughnuts ($7) - These are yummy! The doughnuts are very light and not greasy at all. The doughnuts were filled with tasty yuzu glaze and more glaze with pistachios were on top. The refreshing citrus flavor and light texture of the doughnuts made for a nice dessert.   They didn't open until 5 pm (when we happened to arrive) and people were already waiting to get in. You might want to call ahead and make a reservation. And come hungry! There is also a sushi bar."}
{"text":"No a la carte menu here but the sushi is good and a good all you can eat price!  We took a chance on this spot while gambling at the M. I wasn't sure what I was walking in to so we grabbed a seat at the bar and asked for a menu. The bartender explained that they only did all you can eat and had two choices to select the cheaper one being about $25 and the other choice included sashimi for $35. Both choices include lots of different rolls, appetizers and other choices.   My husband wasn't that hungry so we had originally wanted to order a few rolls for myself and an appetizer for him but since we couldn't do that she explained that I could order take out for the $35 price and pick 6 things off the menu and then just eat them at the bar together. This sounded a little weird to me but since we were already here and sushi sounded delicious we took the chance.   I ordered 4 rolls including soft shell crab, the M girl a shrimp tempura and a Spicy Tuna. We also ordered the pork ribs and chicken lettuce wraps for our last two of the six choices. Once the food came it felt a little awkward eating out of plastic containers at the bar but that's what we were told we could do.The sushi was really tasty. It all tasted fresh, had good flavor and was served in full roll portions. The ribs had good flavor but did not come with a sauce and the chicken lettuce wraps were just average to me. They didn't come with a sauce either and the chicken seemed a little dry.  I would come back here with hungry people to try their AYCE sushi menu in the dining room. The menu had a large selection of things on it including tacos, chow mein, shrimp tempura, edamame, regular rolls and sashimi. I think the price was good for the amount of food served and the service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Jayde is located inside M resort. When I just walked into the restaurant, I was impressed by all the flowers inside the glass wall on each side of entrance hallway. I started my meal with cocktail Yuzu Rita. I am a fan of everything made with yuzu. However, I didn't enjoy this drink very much. It tasted artificial and lacked refreshing citrus flavor. I had 5 spiced duck sliders as appetizer. I didn't like this dish at all. There was no 5 spiced flavor. All I tasted was lots hoisin sauce. I also had chef's famous dish, bibimbap. It was very good! It was plating in very artistic way. I love the shiitakes in this dish. I also ordered Korean style lobster. It was very flavorful. Lobster was perfectly cooked and succulent. My only complaint would probably be its sauce. It was a bit too salty to me. I also tried seafood soup. Flavor of soup was okay. There wasn't anything special. For desserts, I had lychee ice cream and white chocolate strawberry mousse cake. Both were excellent! I had lots lychee sorbet in my life, but never had lychee ice cream before. It was light and creamy. I really enjoyed chef added some crunchiness in this dish. Strawberry mousse came in very beautiful presentation. It was made with just right amount of sweetness. Price is reasonable here. Service is very friendly and welcoming. I bump Jayde up from 3.5 to 4 stars for its great service and delicious desserts."}
{"text":"Went to for the all you can eat sushi, was disappointed by the limited menu and the overall quality. There are better options for all you can eat sushi in Vegas.  Really great view of the city from the bar though..."}
{"text":"Kind of a weird dining experience.  Perhaps they are still working out the kinks?  First, I checked out the menu and saw there were basically no vegetarian options.  So, I asked the person at the front if they have vegetarian food.  She said they can make a vegetarian version of lots of stuff.  I asked if they can make the lettuce wraps vegetarian.  She said no.  We tried it anyway because we were on the brink of dying of starvation, the line for the buffet was a trillion miles long, and the wait at Anthony's Burgers & Brews was 30 minutes.  I asked the server what vegetarian options they have.  She said they can make 90% of the menu vegetarian.  I asked if they can make vegetarian lettuce wraps, she said no.  I looked at the menu.  Hmm.  Not sure how you'd make salmon, lobster, or chicken vegetarian.  So, the \"90%\" thing is definitely not true.  I decided on the chow mein without meat.  There were no offers to sub with tofu or anything.  My brother asked again, is there any way they can just make the lettuce wraps with tofu instead of meat?  Our server checked with the chef, and, miracles of miracles, they were able to do it.  Awesome, but weird that we basically had to beg them to try.  I also tried the veggie rolls.  Nothing special, I'd skip it next time.  The food was all okay - nothing amazing, but the prices were pretty good for a Casino restaurant in Vegas.  The made a mistake on one thing and fixed it right away.  The chef came over to ask how everything was, I told her they should put more vegetarian stuff on the menu.  She said they can make most of the things on the menu without meat.  Oy, for the millionth time, JUST PUT IT ON THE MENU THEN!  (I did not watch Restaurant Express and therefore was not star struck by the chef, she was nice though.)"}
{"text":"Solid deal for solid fish - not blow your mind good, but fresh enough to do the trick and be well worth it for $24.99 including sake for all. We had access to the whole sushi menu, which made it easy to order anything we wanted - a lot of AYCE places stratify the fish and do a lot of add-ons for better rolls, etc. Of the rolls I liked Surf and Turf the most, while everything else was about in line with what you would expect.   For an off-off-off Strip hotel, I was impressed with the quality of the food throughout M Resort, and Jayde was no exception."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat when we are in Vegas on business. Now they are exclusively an all you can eat restaurant. They offer both hot food and sushi. Both menus are great. I really enjoyed their sushi rolls and everyone who ordered hot food loved it as well. Their sushi would be even better if it had less rice. The service you receive depends on the server you have. One server we have gotten several times (I wish I could remember his name) is really great and makes it a really pleasant experience. One time we went we got someone else and he wasn't super friendly, but the food was still really good. As far as all you can eat sushi goes, it is delicious."}
{"text":"I brought my hubby here for a pre V day dinner. It wasn't so bad. Food was great. I had made my reservation online. The hosts up front need to have a little bit more class, if you ask me. They brought us to our table and my husband thought it to be a lil small, which he was right. So the host asked us to return to the front and wait until the table next to us would take \"5\" minutes to clean up and prepare. Well that \"5\"minutes turned out to be \"25\" minutes. Once seated, our server was great and the food was great also. I would definitely return and bring my family too."}
{"text":"Restaurant looks great and spacious.   Menu is a bit limited for an AYCE sushi.  Comes with sake the AYCE.  Any additions are extra.  Does not have any ala carte options.   Great ambience."}
{"text":"First time eating at Jayde and it was a great experience. The dining room is spacious with a great view and wonderful ambiance. We ate off the specialty menu and there was a huge selection of items. Everything we had was delicious! Too bad our eyes were bigger than our stomachs! I can't wait to go back and try other items we couldn't get to. The service was also wonderful! We had Sean, Tyler and Jesus assisting and they all were very professional, helpful, speedy and made our first time dining at Jayde a great night out! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent!We ordered the all you can eat and they do not skimp on the quality and quantity is amazing. The salt and pepper crab legs were delicious and easy to extract. Our server Ian was attentive and always made sure were kept happy and full. It was our first time there and we are new and continuing customers."}
{"text":"I can't write about the food, because I left before we even got sat. But we got there at 6, and at that point, it was a potentially an hour wait. We had issues with even giving the hostess our phone number. I walked away thinking that I wouldn't even get called due to the fact that she kept getting our number wrong. Sure enough, after 40 min, we went back to see how long the wait was, and she apologized. She apologized that she called our number and it was the wrong number. She would seat as soon as she could. That turned into another 45 min. We joined a group of people leaving for the same reason. The wait. I'm sure the food is good, but I didn't get the chance to try it. We went to Anthony's and got sat right away. Great food. Great service. The only thing was the selection was minimal for $25. Even Sushi Mon had a better selection for $21."}
{"text":"Wow this place was great.  We had the all you can eat and everything tasted amazing and delicious and was well made.   The Orange Crush was great as were the korean tacos and the ribs were very flavorful and delicious..The Blue Lagoon cocktail was great and went well with our food.  Our waiter Matt was very attentive and helpful when it came to making our selections.  Consider us repeat customers."}
{"text":"Why did i come back here? Because they had all-you-can-eat sushi and i figured why not give it a whirl. Bad idea! Im surprised people are saying this stuff is any good, but then again quite a few people dont really have a clue either.   - Fresh Water Eel - Weird texture, and tasted fatty or oily in the skin - Spicy tuna - Very off texture and lacking  - Surf & Turf roll - A MESS of SAUCE...just drenched in sauce that i couldnt eat it  - All rolls with sauce - Too much sauce!   The nigiri is the only thing i finished with given its hard to mess that up since there isnt any sauce, its just simple rice and fish. If you must go here, stick this route for your own good. As for the management, fill your soy sauce bottles! Around the ENTIRE sushi bar we have a total of a combined half bottle of soy, spread over the 6 bottles at the bar."}
{"text":"I used to be a Palazzo Hotel guest regular until I discovered M Resort Hotel...c'mon free comp room..now how could anyone pass that up right?  =)  The Studio B buffet  is a great staple but really wanted to try Jayde Fuzion.  I watched a few episode of Food Network \"Restaurant's Express and so that's how i knew of the Executive Chef for this restaurant. Of course it was a plus she was Korean...gotta support my peoples :)  We arrived right when they opened (5pm) so there was no wait! As i skimmed through the menu, i saw alot of authetic korean dishes in which was awesome. I was quite interested in seeing how they would execute the taste since I grew up with Korean food. The portions were smaller than i'm used to but the flavor of everything was superb! This is what we ordered:  Korean Lobster-This dish reminded me of many chinese type dishes i've had in the past with the usual ginger and soy sauce base flavor but i love how they added a twist by making it korean, as it's name, by adding some korean pork, spices and veggies. There wasn't that much lobster pieces but in other restaurant dishes....they really isn't in the first place. I would definately eat this again...but maybe next time i'll order two for just myself..oink oink! Pork Wrap-This was a fancy upgrade to what i'm used to, Samgyupsal (korean name for it). It tasted the similar but again with special additional ingredients.  Nice appetizer instead of just a salad. They give you four pieces.  Kalbi Rib-This was sweeter than the normal kalbi i'm used to. The beef quality was great but i wasn't really digging the extra sweetness. You can definately taste the kalbi that you usually eat but with a thicker teriyaki like sauce. I would've like them to have brought this out with white rice or something to neutralize the sweetness. Kimchee Fried Rice-This was my absolute favorite of the dishes! OMG it's just like mom makes it but this extra spice/seasoning that kicks you to want more in your mouth. CRACK would be a better word. More please?!?!?!?!?  Since it seems like they have mostly korean dishes, i wish the name and decor was more \"korean\" themed though.They have the green for chinese and the cherry blossoms for japanese......Oh well maybe later if they ever remodel. =)"}
{"text":"When I think AYCE sushi for less than $35, my expectations are set to the lowest of the low.  However, after dining here the other night, I was pleasantly surprised.  No, you are not going to get high-end, top notch, melt in your mouth sushi, but it was pretty good. The fish was not at all fish-y and the cuts was pretty big.    AYCE Sushi for $24.95 AYCE Jayde Specialties for $24.95  or AYCE Everything for $32.95  Jayde specialties are pretty much asian dishes- from kogi tacos to fried rice, dumplings, calamari and so on.    I love sushi, so I went for their AYCE sushi menu.  I ordered 2 cut rolls, 1 albacore, 2 salmon, 2 unagis, 1 yellowtail, and 1 ikura.  Was super full and I think it was totally worth the $24.95 price. My friends pretty much ordered everything on the Jayde menu and their favorite was the Kogi Tacos and fried rice.  Think of this place in comparison to Kabuki, Yamato, and those other small, cheap Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was pretty average. Fortunately the prices were reasonable so I felt it was fair.  They are lacking on the custom cocktail department.  The bar made a decent gimlet however.  The best thing we had was the geisha roll."}
{"text":"Peaceful atmosphere, great view of the city, great service and delicious food.  I haven't been to too many places like this. For ~$30 per person, you can get unlimited Asian dishes and sushi/nigiri.  It's like a buffet except the food is brought to you fresh!  They have a menu that you can just keep ordering items from.   Whenever we have people in town, this is always one of the places we take them too!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"All you can eat either sushi, hit plates or combination. We decided for hit plates. The Korean tacos and ribs were my favorite. Mochi us awesome too"}
{"text":"Server Sean is busy watching football game rather than providing a basic service.  He doesn't know how to say sorry when a customer nicely complains.  Sushi rice was missing venager and no one is ready accept.  Do NOT go here unless you are desperate to eat in M hotel only because the buffet line wait is too long.  NEVER coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Let me first disclose that I did not even get to eat there.  This one star is for the heavily advertised 'ALL YOU CAN EAT' with included Sake on billboards along St. Rose highway, as well as on signs throughout the M property.  I have tried to eat here (just the all you can eat) twice to no avail.  When you go there, they only offer it at the bar/counter (not even the entire bar, just one half of it) and are asked to wait if it is full (and it always is, because the seating is so limited!).  Nevermind that the rest of the dining area is open with lots of seats, they will only offer it at the bar.  Also, if there is a wait, you must wait there or lose your place.  They have no waiting list, nothing to take names, and the hostess just assures you that she'll remember who arrived first.  It really makes no sense.  I almost gave in to be seated in the restaurant and simply order off the regular menu, but because this was my second crack at this place, I was completely turned off, and didn't even want to eat there at all.  Perhaps this sounds like sour grapes, and maybe it is, but for as HEAVILY as they advertise the All You Can Eat option, they provide really no availiability."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on their AYCE sushi.   When we got here the place was very quiet and not alot of people were eating. We have been so excited to try this place but haven't gotten around to it and finally saw the huge billboard and took it as a sign to eat here.   When we first were greeted the hostess took us to the back and was going to sit us at the bar. We asked if we could get a table instead and she said well no all the sushi is eaten at the bar. Then we looked around and saw a few other tables that people were eating sushi at.  Shen then proceeded to say that she could seat us at a table but that \"It would be more convenient for us in case we get a group of 4 or something\". This was told to us even though there was only 3 other tables occupied out of the maybe 30 they have.   Regardless we sat at the bar and ordered away. The pork buns and eggrolls were delicious but that it pretty much where it ends.  The selection of rolls was extremely limited and had maybe 10 options to choose from. I get it, they were made with good ingredients but nothing tasted extraordinary to be a good sushi AYCE place.   The chefs that were preparing it seemed miserable and no smiles at all when the sushi was brought to us.   If I wanted mediocre sushi and frowning faces, I would have easily just gone to a closer place for a cheaper price instead of driving all the way out the the M for this kind of service.  Also, unfortunately, there is not dessert that is included in the AYCE menu :/ So disappointed in this. May come back and order from regular menu but never again for the sushi AYCE. There are better, cheaper, more delicious options out there."}
{"text":"We went to try the all you can eat and were very disappointed. We waited an hour since you can only sit at the tiny bar.  Then the menu was extremely limited.  I've been to many all you can eat sushi restaurants and I wouldn't recommend for the all you can eat. Price not worth it. I haven't tried the full restaurant yet, but not a top priority now"}
{"text":"So very slow... good food.. understaffed.. paid our check and still waiting for our last roll! HELP"}
{"text":"Fantastic entrance ambiance ! And then ... they put sushi bar instead of tables in front of amazing strip view ...  Toooo much sake me designer what a fail !  Food : we have tried two out of three all you can eat menu .   It really isn't the high quality food you would expect from place with such a nice ambiance   Attentive stuff very nice stuff and extremely helpful but ... they really don't give you a lot of privacy at the tables they will literally check on you every 120 seconds and grab stuff straight out of your table in the middle of conversations- #neednewmanagement"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, nice view, definitely some great options on non sushi foods. The sushi is ok but they could learn a few good things from \" I love sushi \". Ask for little rice when you order sushi. Get a booth so there is a bigger table and a better view."}
{"text":"Decided to give this a second chance. I wish I didn't.  Let's start with the open seating at the bar isn't because seats were reserved.  The people next to me were loud, drunk and obnoxious screaming and slamming everything on the bar and the restaurant did nothing to stop them.  The food was just ok but the experience made it not worth it at all."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner as a group of 4 (2 couples).  We were happy to see the $24.99 price included 8 oz of Sake too!  The server was GREAT!  He was very helpful and explained the menu and each item he was going to bring out.  He went into great detail when describing the food, which made for a great experience!    Overall the food was really nice!  Many items had fresh, unique flavors!!  The beef tenderloin items were amazing!  Definitely a MUST TRY when in the area!!!!"}
{"text":"Just how much sushi do you think you can eat for 25.00??  Challenge accepted!!  3 rolls and I tapped out lol...  good decent sushi here for Vegas standards and prices.  As usual here at the M resort, the service members just make you feel pampered and loved for no apparent reason other than here you are in their house.  The drinks at this particular spot are splendid.  I had a guava mojito and it took my senses to the next level of deliciousness.  You will see me again!!"}
{"text":"The night we went to this restaurant it was understaffed as the assistant manager was serving us. We didn't really mind that but where they really failed is how they served us. It is an all you can eat sushi place with hot food as well. When you order for some reason they bring everything to us all at once, even thought the plates can't even fit on the table! Also your warm food becomes cold. I did notify the assistant manager of this so hopefully that and this review will help them to change. Will not be going to an all-you-can eat at a casino again. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I got a few e-mails from The M announcing this new restaurant, which opened on Thursday.  Eric R.'s birthday is tomorrow, so we decided to celebrate on Saturday night here.  He was thinking sushi initially, and since this is not far from us and also has a sushi bar, we decided to check it out.  This is in the old Marinelli's restaurant spot and is very swanky.  There is a green light trim (the previous restaurant was red-lit).  Right when we were seated, Chef Seonkyoung Longest (winner of Restaurant Express on Food Network) was making the rounds of every table and we were next!  She was so friendly and talked to us about her restaurant, and she showed so much pride.  Our server was Doug and he is fantastic.  He was very friendly, informative, and personable.  We talked to him about dish sizes to make sure we were not over-ordering.  I started with a Yuzu Rita (yuzu juice, grand marnier, soju, simple syrup) rimmed with sea salt, and Eric R. had the Pacific mojito (in fact, 2 of them) AND jasmine green hot tea, which was by tea forte and in cute little pyramid infuser.  All of the serveware was very cool, with a theme of white wavy patterns.  The salt and pepper shakers were like puzzle pieces that fit together (our little marriage theme too, awww) and had white wavy patterns, the white napkins had this pattern across it, plates were rimmed with it, the tea pot also....soooo cute!  I liked it a lot!  Water glasses were stemmed jewel tone dark green which which was really cool and went with the green mood lighting.  We started with 2 apps, the duck sliders (5 spiced duck, cucumber, steamed bao with kaiware, cilantro and green onions to add) and Korean \"street tacos\" which was deconstructed: 3 scallion pancakes (wish there were 4!!!), bulgogi, cabbage in \"kimchi sauce,\" and shredded vegetables (radish, peppers) with sriracha-lime sauce.  Chef Longest stopped by to check on us after we had our apps.  We told her our entree is the bimibap, and she cheerfully told us that her mom came on opening night and approved of the bimibap (FYI: Chef grew up in Korea).  Apparently this was one of the top dishes from the show that she made.  The bimibap was served in a beautiful bowl with the egg perfectly poached easy on top, with a side of the sauce.  The server wanted to mix it up with the sauce but Eric R. tasted it and felt the slow burn in his non-spicy palate.  We declined and I just mixed it with the poached egg.  We then split it and then I added the sauce.  Everything was sooooo good.  I loved the shiitakes in the dish.  Next, we ordered a little sushi: the Lady Luck Roll (salmon, tuna, hamachi on top, inside asparagus, gobo, avocado) and toro nigiri (3 pieces for $10, I think the 3rd was given to us for Eric R.'s birthday though).  The quality of the fish was excellent.  The maguro on the menu is bigeye and there is also blue fin tuna available.  For Eric R.'s birthday, he got a beautiful strawberry-white chocolate dessert with gold leaf on top that was just beautiful and delicious.  He loves both of those things so the restaurant nailed it.  However, the chef encouraged me to try the yuzu doughnuts because of my yuzu-love.  I guilted Eric R. into letting me get a 2nd dessert since he had 22 drinks and I had one.  The yuzu doughnuts came out pretty quickly.  They were described as yuzu-cream filled but they were actually not filled.  Also troublesome was the fact that they were room temperature.  I just expected warm to hot doughnuts.  They were just like room temperature dough drizzled with yuzu cream and topped with chopped pistachios.  The cream was fine (not as yuzu-y as the drink) but the temperature of the doughnuts just did not work.  Eric R. actually asked one of the chefs walking back toward the kitchen about it, and he immediately said they are supposed to be room temperature because otherwise the sauce would break.  I guess I personally didn't like it but other people might.  Just get the yuzu rita!!  Overall, service is great, the Chef is really enthusiastic, the ambiance is nice, and the food is excellent.  Also, the prices for food and drink are very reasonable ($8 for a specialty cocktail!) We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This spot feels like a well kept secret from tourists. Its ambiance is relaxed and modern. The choice menu consists of simple dishes, but when presented and tasted, it is anything but ordinary. Taste profile is full of complexity and wild. You won't regret coming here."}
{"text":"I ate here on 2/6. Here is how it went down... Came off of the road to grab a bite to eat before we drove into Vegas...We get to the restaurant about 15 minutes after they opened. The hostess told us that we had to wait 30 minutes to sit at the sushi bar...We weren't happy to hear this as we had been on the road for hours and we didn't see a whole lot of people in the restaurant. The manager witnessed the situation and walked over and showed us to a table (he must have seen the disappointment on our faces) which was REAL cool! Not sure what that deal was...but we ran with his offer and thanked him kindly.  We got seated at a larger table  that was in somewhat close proximity to the kitchen which was ok with us because we were starving. The restaurant has a nice ambiance with a touch of class.   We opted for the all you can eat sushi menu which was about $25 that came with free hot sake...The menu had about 6 appetizer choices, about 8-10 sushi roll choices and about 10 Nigiri choices. I started off with pork egg rolls which came out with the quickness and they were delicious...then I went on to the steamed pork bun...which I have never eaten, but remember friends munching on them at school...It wasn't my cup of tea...I'm sure it would be good to someone is accustomed to eating them. It was fresh and hot though. I had a rainbow roll and a surf and turf roll and both were EXCELLENT...Good quality fish! I didn't have room for anymore food....but I do look forward to going back and trying more of their sushi choices. Speaking of choices...if you are a person that likes a lot of variety when it comes to sushi, this may not be your spot...I'm not very particular about sushi selections (for me, the plainer the better- it's more about quality) when it comes to sushi so I will definitely make this a regular stop on my way to Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm basing the one star on the horrible service when you walk up. The property has really taken a dive since the new owners took over. The Food Network girl that took over this restaurant I don't blame her but service of the people that they have hired  to run it is absolutely atrocious. Just asked one of the customers how the food was when they walked out they said don't waste your life so there you have it"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've been. The price is reasonable and all of there rolls are delicious. I personally prefer the rolls over the nigiri but that's my taste. Even so their nigiri were also delicious. Going back to the rolls, each roll is creative and has unique flavor. I don't even like shrimp and one their rolls with shrimp tempura was absolutely delicious. My personal favorite would be the surf and turf.  The atmosphere is clean and contemporary, just the way I like it and the staff are very kind and attentive. One tip though, since every sushi is hand crafted to order, it's recommended to order while dining on you current sushi to reduce waiting time for the next round. Will definitely visit again every time I'm on my Vegas vacation."}
{"text":"The staff was really nice and the atmosphere was great. Their deserts are awesome. We did the AYCE option but we didn't get much out of it. There wasn't a lot of variety or options and my mom was disappointed that they didn't have hot or cooked sushi. Also, we could only do full rolls not half so even though the selection was small we got too full try give more things a try. They had a citrus roll however that was awesome. My usual sushi restaurant doesn't have that so that was the highlight of the meal really."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try Chef Longest's food after watching her win Restaurant Express. We loved everything. We tried several of the appetizers and side dishes. Our favorites were the Street Tacos, Duck Sliders and especially the Crab Salad. We will definitely come back the next time we're in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Our first vist to this restaurant. Our waiter was very helpful and explained the menu to us. We all opted for the all you can eat sushi roll. It also includes edamame, cucumber salad and miso soup. The waiter suggested we start with 2 rolls.... which was a good idea. There was a great variety of rolls and none were overly spicy. The waiter checked us often to see what we wanted to order. This is a nice option for sushi that doesn't  break the bank. Will definitely return to Jayde Fusion!"}
{"text":"I'll give them 4 but the service is slow.  Food not bad but not the most creative.  Beats eating the buffet here"}
{"text":"I was at an event being held at the M Resort and decided to try the sushi restaurant within the hotel as this was one of the 6 options available. The restaurants in M Resort operate at rather odd times from my perspective but perhaps it's because I don't gamble. This place is open from 5-10pm which probably should have been a sign about the quality.  Not so Good: - Sushi was fishy in smell and taste. This is often more apparent to me as I order sushi that is straight forward and without sauces, so when the fish isn't great I taste it and then douse it with lemon.  - You have to pay at least $25 even if you are only getting 1 sushi role.  Good: - Service was friendly and accommodating, I ate at the  bar where I was looked after promptly. - You can order takeaway of up to 6 roles for $25 - They offer Skye Ginger vodka which I love and was a great match to the sushi.  I would not search out this spot for sushi and would only go back for a vodka ginger cocktail which is why I'm giving 2 stars."}
{"text":"Love Love love!! The service was great, the food was fantastic and the drinks are not too pricey. We decided to go with the All you can eat and it was totally worth every penny. Thinking this is going to be our new couples date night spot!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi and Asian food for 32 bugs and really delicious!! Come here with a big appetite though. Located in the M casino. Recommendable if you love sushi!!!"}
{"text":"The service was good and the venue is nice, however it's very medocre non-authentic asian food at best.  All you can eat where you can choose from the sushi buffet, chinese buffet, or both.  The food is ordered rather than actual buffet style where you get up and grab it yourself so it does take a little while to get your food."}
{"text":"At the bar, Brittany, my server, was on point.  A suitable and expansive menu stands to satisfy any taste, understanding the projected image of the restaurant.  Hamachi sashimi starter amply offered sprouts, wasabi along with mild and comforting hamachi.  The butter lettuce salad delivered a wholesome aroma of rice vinegar, but not at all overwhelming.  Representing an effort to 'eating healthy'.  The ribs were served Korean-style cut with a sweet-without being cloying sauce dressed gently.  This was a feast!  Billed as \"small plates\", there was no short service on this night.  Conversation with a couple from \"across town\" in Summerlin, combined with a splendid taste treat, made the night extraordinary.  Las Vegas is not what most people perceive.  There's a lot more here than gaming."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on multiple occasions. This place is an Asian cuisine(Chinese,Thai,Japanese etc.)/ sushi AYCE restaurant. Often when I eat here I opt for the Asian cuisine without the sushi makes it cheaper and to be honest there are better sushi places than this location. The Asian cuisine is above average the sushi average. Whenever we eat here we definitely always order the honey walnut prawns and what ever specialty dish they might. Last week it was \"Hamachi Kama\" aka yellowtail collar, it was very well prepared and the sauce they paired with it perfect!!! Also this place is very beautiful the ambiance and decor set it apart from other places!!! The best thing about this dinning location would have to be the STAFF!! Every time I have been here they have been nothing but pleasant! Kind and attentive is what truly makes me come back!   So two things they could improve on!! 1. The sushi!! 2. Outdoor seating cause I think that would be awesome!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, small servings, overly priced. The three of us ordered the won ton soup, kimchi fried rice and the Korean japchae. When the food arrived we were 1) surprised at the small portion size and 2) found that they had forgotten about the japchae order. Instead of checking on us after we received our incorrect order, our waitress (Iris) avoided our table even after making eye contact with her twice. The two of us who received our orders waited for the third order to arrive (the polite thing to do). Fast forward 15 minutes...no third order and no Iris to be found. At this point, our food was cold and we were getting irate. Kyle, who I assume was the manager on duty, tried to smooth things over with us but it was too late. We had lost our appetite waiting for our incompetent server to appear. He comp'd our meal, which was nice of him. But we definitely won't be going back after the poor service and small portioned dishes."}
{"text":"I didn't really care for the food here. It was lacking in flavor. The options are extremely slim on the sushi side. The server was terrible. I had to keep asking her for the same thing over and over again.   The only nice thing about this place was the décor. Really nice looking restaurant.   I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"We were really impressed with Jayde Fuzion.  It was a Thursday night, and we couldn't decide where to eat.  After perusing the menus of most of the restaurants, we decided to give Jayde a shot.  This is a large room, with what I presume is a nice view when the sun is shining.  The chairs were VERY comfortable, which was a surprise given that they didn't have armrests, and I usually prefer an armrest.  I sunk right into this chair, and it was the perfect height for the table.  We decided to go with small plates/appetizers to share.  We had (in my order of preference):  Kalbi ribs, Korean street tacos, BBQ pork buns, rock shrimp tempura, and crispy fried chicken skewers.  The ribs were fantastic, slathered in a sweet sauce that had enough heat, and they got a nice char from the grill.  I could have easily eaten the whole plate myself and added another.  Also, I felt the order size was very fair given the price.  My second favorite were the Korean street tacos.  You get 3 to an order, and quite a bit of beef.  The sriracha lime sauce went great with the beef and crispy veggies.  They are served with a scallion pancake, which I didn't really taste.  But, the rest of the dish was so great I didn't miss it.  The buns were solid, but it was a lot of bun to not much filling.  The rock shrimp was pretty standard, you can get this dish a lot of places.  They are served with a sort of thai chili sauce, which was great, but like I said, it's pretty standard.  The chicken skewers were a miss for us.  We didn't care for the sauce, and the chicken wasn't (or didn't appear to be) seasoned prior to frying.  These were way better than what you would get at a fast food joint, but we were not in a fast food joint.  So, I expected more.  Service was attentive, and they took a great team approach.  Plates were constantly taken off of our table, and we never went long needing a refill.  We'd certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in to try this place, and it does look pretty cool. The night we dined, there appeared to be a staff shortage. We had a server that was focused on a massive table of people, and since that's the big tip ticket hey, I get it. We ordered an appetizer that never arrived and we did have to bring it up to get it off our bill.   What really bothered me was the food. It just wasn't that good. One roll I liked while the others were just...whatever.   What really prompted me to write this review was the fact I just bought some sushi for lunch from Sprouts for $13. It came with 3 different rolls, and I enjoyed each of them quite a bit. It's disappointing I dropped $120 for a meal that just wasn't very good compared to grocery store bought Sushi."}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience at Jayden Fuzion. The sushi was excellent, we had the egg rolls, chow mein and Kung Pao chicken which were all good - they have an all-you-can-eat price for sushi, Jayden specialties, or both together. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Jayde was one of our favorite restaurants up until recently. They have started playing with the menu and changing the offerings. We loved the cucumber salad with greens, now they offer it with no greens, so it's mostly just sliced cucumbers. Bad idea. Also they've gone to an all you can eat menu,  I don't dislike that idea but in doing so they have dropped some favorites from the menu. No more Cashew chicken, no more Singapore noodles. They are slowly ruining what was a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and the food was great. We had the street tacos and the tempura. We can't wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. We showed up on a Saturday night a couple of weeks ago for the all you can eat sushi portion and truly I've never had more dismal sushi or even worse service in a long long time. The waiter forgot my drink and he forgot our calamari. The sushi literally tasted old and fishy and was so unappetizing we did not have more than a few rolls each and left hungry. We could only leave after waiting 30 minutes for the check. This is not acceptable. I was trained to cook myself by a European trained chef so when I go out to eat and get pathetic and tasteless food like this, it's beyond frustrating. This place has gone down dramatically now it's no longer in the hands of the Marnell family. Just like Harrah's  destroyed the Rio, also formerly owned by the Marnells. People that know the Vegas of today have no idea how amazing it actually used to be. They actually enjoy some of the slop that is served up in these casinos. It's not good, it's freaking wretched. Of course you'll see some good reviews on here because obviously there's a lot of people out there that just like cheap and are not looking for actual quality. They just want to save money and slurp some beers. The thing is though, it was still over $100. Save your money and go anywhere but this place as I assure you, you'll be glad you did. Go to local places individually owned by families as it's the only way to get great food these days. I'll shamelessly plug for Sushi Mon here for a decent AYCE place. I do recognize that this place was not meant to be five star but this was beyond awful."}
{"text":"I've dined at The M many times and I'm not sure how I've missed this spot. Simple delicious sushi, great \"fusion\" options, and the ambiance was fantastic. Very inexpensive for such a gorgeous property, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place since I was there 5 months ago but it was horrible last night. The service was worse than SLOW. We ordered 2 piece unagi and it took over 30 minutes to get it.  We ordered other things and those came quicker. This is what we ordered... honey walnut prawns- basically shrimp tempura and heavily breaded. There was about a tablespoon of sauce for 5 prawns.  Calamari- way over cooked, so rubbery we left 3/4 of the plate. Korean street tacos- flavorless and it tasted more like a cabbage taco than a beef taco. It came with 3 tacos. We ate 1/2 of one and left the rest. Chicken Pad Thai- sauce and noodle were good but the chicken was so dry and over cooked couldn't even swallow it. Left about 3/4 of dish uneaten. All the sushi rolls were good, some lacked flavor but it was MUCH better than the cooked food.  Based on my most recent visit, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went with my wife on a whim, no reservation. They said they had no tables for an hour but we could get on wait list at sushi bar. So we did. Waited 10 minutes, not a problem. When we sat down the bar was packed (18 seats I think) and there wasn't a bartender in site. Apparently they have to go deliver drinks to the restaurant. What? Anyway, after 5 more minutes we got menus. I got a ginger drop martini, eh, not very good, Beth had iced tea.  We ordered 2 apps, Korean Street Tacos and chicken Lettuce wraps. The tacos were like little pancakes with beef and lettuce and some radish type stuff with a nice spicy sauce. We liked these very much. The lettuce wraps were a bit greasy and needed either a sauce or something crunchy. They were not as good as PF Changs. Entrees were beef chow mien, spicy seafood noodle and shrimp/sausage fried rice. The beef chow mien was awesome (except there really was not very much beef) noodles were cooked perfectly and they had a nice sweet flavor with red peppers , book Choy and mushrooms. The spicy noodles were as advertised very spicy, there was small shrimp and clams, it was all in a bowl with lots of broth. There  could have been more noodles, they looked like ramen noodles. The spice was excellent and lasted on my lips about 3 minutes after finishing. The shrimp and sausage fried rice may have been the best we ever had. We had yuzu donuts for desert they had a cool lemony filling and were kind of sweet, they were pretty good. As far as the \"extras\" well, there was no soap in the women's bathroom and no hook in the stall to hang a coat. There is a small sink at the sushi bar which is right next to the ice they use to make drinks. Well, when the servers bring old glasses back to the bar the bartenders just chuck whatever is left in the glass into the tiny sink and yep you guessed it the remnants splash into the ice. That's bullshit. I was never asked if I wanted another drink. The bar back filled my water glass most of the time, not sure if that's his job or not. The bill was $81, we had a $10 coupon that probably every Las Vegan got seeing as the owner of the place won Restaurant Express on Food Network and they are marketing it full force. We also paid with M points as it is in the M hotel and casino so the final cost was $65, we left 18 percent tip. We'd go there again but probably only if it was comped."}
{"text":"Hands down the best contemporary Asian restaurant in the Henderson/Las Vegas area.  I came here with my family. Since it's a Wednesday night, the restaurant wasn't that full. Everything in the restaurant, from the food to the presentation of the restaurant, is very well-done. The waiters were very nice to us, and they even explained some items that were on the menu as well as some items that weren't on the menu. They also came by our table a few times just to check up on us and ask about the quality of the food. The food was also brought out very quickly.  Every food item on the menu is made to share with others, so I recommend coming with a group instead of with just one other person. I can't recommend just one menu item because all of the items I've had were really good. I had the duck sliders, the Korean street tacos, the M Girl roll, the spicy tuna hand roll, the Surf n' Turf roll, and the chow fun. Savor each bite you take out of every food you eat because there is so much to taste, especially in the sushi. The only bad thing I have to say is that the chow fun noodles are chewy, but the beef in the chow fun is just plain savory and excellent. The strawberry shortcake we had for dessert was heavenly.  Even though the M Resort is pretty out of the way, and the food can get pricey, I strongly recommend coming here at least once."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to come check this new restaurant out.  We come to the M Resort a lot but we tend to do the same things over and over.  Yesterday we both were in the mood for some Japanese food and decided to try out Jayde.  We were both very happy with the choice.  Our food, service and drinks were amazing.  They have some great AYCE options at around $25.    We had plenty of sushi, sashimi, sake and a couple cold beers.  Very good atmosphere and the customer service is great."}
{"text":"First of all, the service here is awesome! Our server, Kirk is awesome and very helpful and always checking up on us. He's made a lot of great advices for our selection and he did not disappoint.  I would definitely come back here for the awesome food and the great service!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Had all you can eat sushi was worth the $24.99 prices of thing that we were disappointed with was the rice was soggy. Too much water when they cooked it's but everything else it was good . Ambience was awesome . Service was awesome. Would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"The service was the poorest that I have ever received. I spoke to the manager about it at the end of the evening and he did nothing about but apologize. Food was nothing special. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Just ok. We got the All you can eat menu. California roll and tiger roll not good. Tasted very old. Korean tacos not to bad. The best thing was honestly the fried rice. Very fresh and a good taste. The Chinese fun noodles were spicy but has a really good flavor and the beef in it was moist. Took awhile to get our check but I guess it was a Saturday night so it was to be expected. The miso soup was also good and a large portion. Not bad overall for 32 bucks a piece."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for $25, even on a limited menu, is a good deal. That, and the complimentary bottle of sake per person earns this place my admiration.  Also, no limit on number of rolls you can order at once.  Tasty sushi, great ambient music, professional atmosphere, good price... I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I had came here for dinner with family and we all placed our orders: won ton soup, kimchi fried rice, and japchae. The food that arrived: 2 orders of won ton soup and kimchi fried rice. The person who brought the food came with 2 orders of won ton soup and kimchi fried rice. There was a very clear mistake that was made but the server just looked a little confused and took the second bowl of own ton soup back. No apologies or acknowledgment of an error was made. I assumed that he went back to get my order so I waited...and waited. No one came back to check on our table, and when we tried to get the attention of our waitress, she avoided us like the plague.   Needless to say, I did not get my meal and by the time we got someone's attention, the other people in my party had finished eating. We complained to the manager and left.   As far as the food goes, the won ton soup had a measly 2 won ton in it and the kimchi fried rice (which I had tasted) was absolutely nothing to write home about. It was mediocre at best. They really should tout the head chef as a tv-competition winner with food like that, and she should be ashamed of the servers who bring down her name.   Bottom line, this place was very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant now. The menu is divided into 3 parts in which the first two options are limited, thereby less expensive than the last option. We picked the first option (with the nigiri and rolls) and sampled all of the Nigiris along with two rolls:  orange crush and surf and turf. Everything was decent, not great. I don't think I want to come back here."}
{"text":"An interesting spin on fusion and buffet dining.  Environment: Located in the M Casino, the exterior as well as the interior of the restaurant are beautiful. The inside is spacious and has an abundance of seating from regular tables, to private dining areas, and beautiful patio overlooking the pool, and even a sushi bar with some stools.  Food: The food is more all-you-can-eat sushi style than buffet in that a waiter takes your order and the food is brought to your table. However, it is one flat price, and you can choose between the Chinese section of the menu, the Japanese section of the menu, or a combination of both for a small additional charge. We went for the combination and were delighted that we could order dumplings, pho, walnut shrimp, and sushi all at once. While this may seem like somewhat of a random mashup of diff3erent types of cuisine, each was respectable. The fish was very fresh for the sushi and the honey walnut shrimps were crispy and succulent. Additionally, the portions were not too big which allowed us to pace ourselves and never get to a point where we were unable to finish the food we had ordered.  Service: Service was very good as well. It leaned more to the fine dining type of service which was nice and out waiter was very prompt in checking up on us and taking any additional orders we may have wanted to place.  Overall, Jayde Fusion provides a great reason for locals to go all the way out to the M hotel and I will likely be back soon."}
{"text":"After eating at numerous locales in Vegas, we decided to try this one as it was in the hotel that we were staying in. The great and powerful \"M\" resort.  The Korean street tacos were so good that we had to have two orders every time that we visited and we visited four times in three days. The prices are so reasonable and everything that we had was soooooo good. My boyfriend tried at least four dishes every visit. The only thing that I did not like was the sushi and that is because I don't like it."}
{"text":"For a restaurant touted for unique fusion cuisine I found it rather underwhelming. We ordered flat noodles, fusion lettuce wraps, and dim sum siao mai. The wraps had buffalo wings type meat in them along with kim chi and rice. I wasn't a fan as the meat was dry and the rice just made the entire dish drier. Hole in the wall komex does the same thing but much better. The other dishes were pretty good but nothing spectacular. I could find equally good foods in china town easily.   Nice decor though."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try. Service was a little Slow, sushi was pretty good but limited menu. Also ordered the basic beef and broccoli. I would not recommend unless you like oily beef and limp broccoli. I POURED the grease off my plate.   The chef was good about offering a replacement but by that time I had lost my appetite."}
{"text":"This was my 4th time here and I think that this is one of the best restaurants in Vegas! Less than a reasonable buffet and I give it a 10 for the way they prepare each meal. My favorites and must try dishes....Jayde Specialites: Ribs, Mongolian Beef, Korean Beef Tacos, Orange Chicken, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Chicken Chow Mein, Pho are all great dishes but honestly all of them are delicious. Service is great as well and food comes right away.   My only complaint,  as I was leaving the restaurant I noticed a dirty looking dog sitting at the table with a couple right behind me. How disgusting!  Dogs have a place and a nice restaurant like this is not a place for dogs, unless a service dog, however this truly wasn't a service dog.  I'm truly disappointed in the restaurant allowing this and may not revisit nor continue referring people here."}
{"text":"Terrific Asian-inspired dishes. We opted for the Chinese plates, there are 13 of them.  Spring roll, tempura shrimp, potstickers, crispy lemon chicken. honey and walnut prawns were all good.  But the star of the night were the Korean Street Tacos! Wrapped in scallion pancakes, I could have eaten three dozen of these delicious packets.  I'd recommend this spot.  We made it through 6 chinese plates before we hit the wall.  Gotta go back and complete the list!"}
{"text":"Loved the layout of this restaurant. It was very elegant and had exquisite floral pieces at the entrance. The staff was very attentive and efficient when serving the dishes. The sushi was very fair priced for AYCE with AYCD saki. Only $24.99! The only drawback for me was the small selection of sushi to choose from on the menu. Other than that I would definitely recommend sushi lovers to try this place out. :)"}
{"text":"Quality of fish remains fresh however the sushi rice was hard & crunchy this visit & yellowtail looked extremely hacked up. Also the amount of rice being used is much larger than normal.  I hope they figure out these little hiccups because they really do make a difference in the enjoyment overall.  I'll go back again because the fish really is fresh & tasty but there are other places that always hit the mark as well such as Sushi Mon."}
{"text":"Ian is the best... he recommends what fits you. Sj at the bar make perfect sushi rolls. Not too big, just perfect"}
{"text":"This is a real gem hidden in plain sight.  I rarely think of venturing into a casino for a real dinner treat that isn't going to break the bank.  Jayde Fuzion, the creation of the Restaurant Express winner, Seonkyoung Longest finds its home in the M Resort.    First off, the prices are more in line with what you would expect to pay on Spring Mountain with most dishes priced $7-14.  This is a fun spot to grab a group of friends and order a variety of dishes for sharing, which allows you to try more tasty dishes.  We loved everything that we tried; you really can't go wrong here.  Some of my favorite dishes are the pork belly lettuce wraps, crab salad, 5 spice duck sliders on bao buns, and the kalbi.  On our next adventure here I plan to try the bibimbap."}
{"text":"I decided to try this sushi place after seeing signs all over town for the $25 all you can eat. Which is the going price in Vegas.  The atmosphere is awesome. That is why I gave 2 stars.  I was seated at the sushi bar and was quite rudely told I had to sit at a certain seat for some bs reason.  I sit down and there are 5 employees behind the counter discussing sex life drama. They are using vulgar language that I could hear perfectly.  After 10 mins of sitting and being ignored, one waiter comes over to me and explains if I want to order I have to fill out an order form. Seriously? I told him what I wanted and he goes on and on about filling out order forms.  I had salmon and it was slimy. And I know slimy fish = old fish.  At the end of my eating once again all the male staff is behind the counter discussing who they want to bang.  Guys using vulgar language to decribe the female private parts is ok at home when hanging with your buddies BUT AT AN UPPERCLASS RESTAURANT??!!!   I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, excellent Korean street tacos.  Food was served fresh and fast.  Wait staff was very attentive to all our needs, bus people kept our table clean."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when we walked in, but I am so happy I did.  We were given a booth near the kitchen.  The experience was special from the hostess seating us, the wait-staff being funny, helpful, knowledgeable, and witty.  I like that in a wait-staff.  People who are there and make it obvious they love their job.  The owner who won the contest spent some time at our table, sharing her life story, talking about the new venture she has in store and giving us recommendations on what to order.    We had so much food on our table.  Spring Rolls, soup, pork buns, duck sliders, fat noodles, kimchi, chocolate banana egg rolls.  Everything was so good; it truly is hard to pick out what my favorite was.    I would like to come back and try new dishes."}
{"text":"The hostesses were confused or not totally instructed to direct people to their tables.  The food was actually not bad although when trying to sit I had the favor of having my fingers laced with the previous persons sauce from their meal on my hand. Other than that we the prices are too much for what you actually get. But overall the food wasn't bad.  Jayde did come out to greet her guests which was not bad but wished she did a bit more but smile and tell us to comeback after we told her about the fish scales my partner got when eating his Snapper."}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar and got all you can eat sushi.  The ngiri was lame.  Every piece of fish was too long to dip in the soy sauce dish.  They were also much too thick, which completely changes the flavor profile for the worse.   I thought I got stabbed in the lip from a splinter on my chopsticks, but turns out it was just the Albacore ngiri, which had bones in every piece...  We should have just walked out right then. I'll leave it at that.  There is nothing special about this sushi restaurant.  I highly recommend this restaurant watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi.  Pretty clear what you are doing wrong."}
{"text":"This is must when in Vegas. Their Geisha, M Girl,  Surf & Turf, and Jayde  rolls are always on my list. The presentation of each roll too pretty to eat.  They have an assortment of dishes like the Korean Tacos and  the Lemon Chicken will have your mouth watering. Food always fresh and consistently delicious. Lets not forgot about the sake, I prefer Hakutsura Nigori. Our waiter and their staff are very pleasant and helpful, the service is wonderful they work together to get the empty plates off the table and such. Always a good night there."}
{"text":"Jayde Fusion - Dinner for 2  - We Ordered:   1) Roasted Shiitake Mushroom soup - arrived lukewarm. Although the seasoning and taste was very good the temperature was barely tepid; the bowl was littered with soup drippings along the sides as though it had been tossed about and the soup itself had formed a congealed film along the top giving the appearance the bowl sat for an extended period of time until it cooled beyond the correct temperature to be served. After a couple tastes, it was obvious that the soup sat too long so I mentioned this to the server who apologized and promised to bring a fresh, hot bowl. It seemed to take an unnecessary amount of time to bring back the soup which arrived much later than the entrée of my companion - and again, the soup arrived barely warm.  2) Grilled Chinese Five Spiced Lamb Chops - 2 chops smothered in a brown sauce that disguised the fact that the chops contained nearly no meat but were rather all bone and fat - really awful. I've purchased from my local market and prepared at home far better lamb chops that were extraordinary in comparison to the sad chops served by Jayde Fusion.  3) Korean Street Tacos - odd combination of ingredients resulting in an easily forgettable taste and gastric experience; edible at best.   Overall, the service was okay but our meals were not served at the same time, creating a situation where one person received their dinner well ahead of the other making for an awkward and uncomfortable situation - did not appear very professional; overall, given the final cost, not a restaurant I would revisit anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food is pretty awesome ( surf&turf roll) and the service from everyone was great. I am however wondering what a service charge is for????"}
{"text":"My background: Eat out at least 2 times a week(many fine dining), love to cook and really enjoy delicious food and a great dining experience  Good : Nice atmosphere. Server tried to act nice.  Bad : Pretty much everything else - Service: Server was not knowledgeable of the menu. Slow service. Did not seem to really care about us at all. Food was dropped on us and the individual seemed to not give 2 shits. - Food : We tried multiple dishes and everything was OK. Nothing stood out at all. Everything was relatively bland. Nothing came out hot, just room temperature really. I would not expect this quality for the price; actually I would not expect this quality for any amount of money. I can go somewhere else and  pay 10 bucks and get a meal that tastes 10 times better than this nonsense.  - Overall : I really do not understand the hype. The head chef is some kind of contest winner of what not, but the food does not reflect that. Perhaps the people she is directing are not following through?.  I am not writing this to hate on the place (I love M casino and have been going there for years), but just hoping others with good taste will see this and not have the same bad experience we had. What really sucks is this was my wife and I's anniversary dinner :("}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, decent prices, service is average. The egg rolls were above average, and the kimchi rice was superb. My companion had the Chinese fried rice and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Service: Impeccable. Waiters were extremely nice and when they heard we came to see the Chef, they brought out Chef Longest to take a picture with us!   4 stars because the food was honestly nothing special but still very good.  Bibimbap: Just like your everyday normal Korean bibimbap but with the bumped up prices.  Kimchi Fried Rice: I thought it was called kimchi fried rice...not just plain old rice because that's what it tasted like. Severe lack of seasoning.  Crab Lettuce Wrap: Crab was really good and the sauce paired nicely with the crab and lettuce wrap however we were at lost with what to do with the wonton crisps it came with.  Samgyeposal Lettuce Wrap: ***This is the most bang for your buck*. Delicious and filling!  The Chef was extremely enthusiastic and meeting her was truly a humbling experience. I wish nothing but the best for the Chef."}
{"text":"I really loved this restaurant.  We ordered edamame to start, along with the Korean street tacos and the asparagus tempura with preserved lemon.  I highly recommend both of these dishes, they were very good.  We got three sushi rolls - the M Girl, Fusion Roll, and I can't remember the name of the other one - all of them were excellent.  My husband had told them it was my birthday when he made the reservation, so they came out with a surprise dessert - some kind of mousse with red stuff on the outside and fresh strawberries.  It tasted just like a strawberry shortcake and it was also awesome.  Our dining experience was great - not only was the food good but I thought the service was very good as well.  Many places we've been can't seem to get the mix right between being attentive and leaving us to enjoy ourselves, but this place did.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I followed restaurant express so I was excited to try this restaurant . It was Friday so it was busy. The menu featured dishes she cooked on the show and some new stuff .  The waiter was very friendly and even talked about the show . Saying the kitchen in the restaurant was the kitchen they had the final competition. And he was even there for the final competition, which I thought was cool.  I got a teriyaki salmon and something called \"fun noodles\"- I can't quite recall the name  . They were amazing! You could definitely tell they use fresh ingredients.  As I'm eating . Seonkyoung longest (the winner) comes to our table and asks how the food is. I was so excited to meet her and told her I followed her on the show .  And was extremely humble and sweet. She was so grateful that her dream came true and you can tell she has a passion for food. She even took a picture with me ! Lastly for dessert . I got a while chocolate strawberry mousse . Which was different from anything I ever tasted . I highly recommend this restaurant. Not only for the food , but for the experience."}
{"text":"Used to love this place to start.  Last time I ate here, the miso smelled awful and fishy, the albacore was slimy with a bloody back, and really nothing tastes fresh.  The Uni and Blue Fin Tuna are now off the all you can eat menu, so I am guessing things at Jayde Fusion aren't going well.  Sorry to say, as this place used to have crazy fresh fish, maybe I caught them on a bad night, but unless something changes I won't be back."}
{"text":"Vegetarian and vegan friendly!  I had an excellent experience at this restaurant. The service was phenomenal, the ambiance was lovely, and the food was delicious.  I asked what options were available for someone who doesn't eat meat and the chef personally. He said they could do vegetarian or vegan options and he clearly knew what he was talking about when he explained exactly how he could make items on the menu vegan.  The actual dishes were so much better than I could have hoped for. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.... Just walking into the place I was a bit confused.  They put the sushi bar, instead of the tables, in front of the amazing view of the strip.  Then I was seated at one of the most uncomfortable booths ever, it was right in front of the kitchen and throughout the meal we had to listen to the staff yelling out orders.  Sushi and roll selection was extremely limited, with majority of the rolls being spicy.  I have had better tasting sushi from Smith's.  Also the layout for the servers was all wrong... watched one guy literally running across the restaurant all night."}
{"text":"Dinner Service from 5PM. Overall Food was Good, Service Very Good, Ambiance Very Good, Fit for foodies, kid-friendly, for groups or special occasion serving Japanese Fusion and Chinese dishes. The cheap fast food chop sticks did not match the formal table cloth and silverware setting.  Comfortable buffet style seating but not busy. Excellent Waiter service.a PLUS. Large Tiger Prawns sere served in the Shrimp Tempura and Honey Walnut Prawns. Although the Calamari were not \"Crispy\" as described, it was deliciously tender. The Crispy Lemon Chicken was well done. The Chinese Friend Rice was a bit salty with the extra soy sauce added. They don't serve Uni, Lobster or raw squid.   As the restaurant name implies, Jayde Fuzion serves Chinese style Japanese delicacies for the American palate. The edamami had too much salt sprinkled. If you are conscious about salt and sweet, ask the waiter to separate the sauce. The waiter, Ian was very accomodating to serve the deep friend soft shelled crab without the rice roll. THIS IS DEFINITELY A PLUS. I would give this place FIVE STARS, had they served more sake and watermelon or fruit to balance the extra salty taste.   Altogether a good experience"}
{"text":"We started off with they called Jayde Favorites. Well guess what? They are my favorites too. We started with the Chicken lettuce wraps. They were moist and flavorful.  They weren't skimpy on the portion sized either.   We moved onto the hot & sour soup.  Very delightful and to top it off they make their own tofu here.  So bold and so delicious.   Have you ever felt like a side of green beans? Me either, but I ordered them anyways and thank goodness we did.  Still had plenty of crunch to them which is a nice change from a doggy over cooked green bean.    Oh then they brought me a little teaser of kimchi.  Hello tummy here it comes.   If that wasn't enough goodness we got the Wagyu Beef Kalbi Ribs.  Oh yeah another winner. They were tender, juicy, and seasoned with the perfect amount of seasonings and top with a teriyaki sauce that wasn't one of those heavy over baring sauces.    Then to complete this buffet of happiness on our table we were also blessed with one if the better tasting Thai Basil Fried Rice.  Right up my alley no egg  We would totally come back"}
{"text":"We got to eat at the famous Jayde Fuzion Restaurant at M Resort. It so happened that we were staying near the hotel when we found out that Jayde Fuzion had finally opened! We ordered a lot of the appys: - Samgyeposal Lettuce Wraps - really really good! - Korean Street \"Tacos\" - love 'em! - Five Spiced Duck Sliders - really good! - Ahi Poke - nice presentation with finely cubed tuna! Nice flavours. Entrees: - Chow Fun Noodles - Best chow fun I've had. Very subtle flavours. - Baby Bok Choy - very small plate of greens - Korean Style Lobster - lobster slit into half down the middle - unusual way to present Asian lobster - good flavours - Asian Sizzling Snapper - great fish dish! Desserts: - Yuzu Doughnuts - very good - Exotic Fruit Salad - very good  Some advice for the restaurant: - The plates are really heavy for passing around and the serving cutlery is so heavy that it doesn't stay on the plate when it's being passed round. it makes such a clatter when the cutlery falls on the table! - All the appys and entrees all came out at once as the waiter explained that the dishes are all done at once and when it's done, they come out. There was no space on the table when the dishes came out. It would be wise to instill a time management program to sort out the appys and entrees.  Biggest thrill: meeting the Restaurant Express winner, Executive Chef Seonkyoung Longest! A very nice and humble lady."}
{"text":"If that fantastic Korean girl who stated the restaurant ate there now she would cry. We tried the all you can eat Asian menu. I'm afraid to say that only two items were even fit to eat. They were the pot stickers and the street tacos. Everything else we didn't eat. The ribs were so hard we couldn't bite into them. The pad Thai was mushy and and the fried rice tasted and smelled terrible. Now let me say this, my wife is Asian and we're in Asian restaurants probably 4 days a week. This is one I will not return to. I asked the server if I could speak to the manager. She said she would but the manager never appea"}
{"text":"Visited Jayde Fuzion on January 2nd after wanting to visit since the end of the show.  There were four of us dinning and we were sharing and trying many different types of food from the menu. I wanted to first wanted to say that our evening would not have been nearly as good if we hadn't had the privilege of having Doug as our server.  Doug knew the menu, answered all of our questions and even gave us suggestions.  He definitely made the evening an amazing experience. Even after we left, we forgot some items at our table and he ran us down before we left to make sure that we got the items. Thank you once again Doug!! To begin with drinks, the Plum Wine was delicious along with the green hot tea (amazingly alternating between these two drinks didn't affect the taste of either of them). We began with the California Rolls which all of the ingredients were so fresh and amazingly tasty. Next came the Duck Sliders and the Shrimp/Veg Tempura.  The Duck Sliders were covered in a delicious sauce and were not overly greasy like some duck dishes can be. The Shrimp/Veg Tempura was also delicious and everything in this dish was very fresh as well and was not over done with the breading. Then came the Korean Tacos and the M Girl Rolls.  The flavors for each of the ingredients were very well done and complemented each other impeccably, and the sauce that came with the tacos was scrumptious. In addition the \"tortillas\" used were so light and fluffy that you could eat these all night and not get full from the bread. I was worried about trying the M Girl Rolls since there were jalapeños in the roll since I can't do many spicy foods. However you couldn't feel the heat from the jalapeños and it really just added to the flavor of the rolls. Some of the main courses included the Emperor Fried Rice and Gochujang Pork. The Emperor Fried Rice had large chunks of crab meat and also gained some heat the more you ate.  Then the Gochujang Pork plate was delicious as well and the sauce that was covering the pork and the veggies was perfect and not over powering. I am a person who LOVES deserts and I will say that this place did not disappoint what so ever.  The Green Tea Creme Brûlée was absolutely scrumptious and it was the best tasting creme brûlée I have ever had, hands down.  We also shared the Lychee Ice-Cream which was also very delicious."}
{"text":"I have to admit that the restaurant has a great atmosphere and the decor is very impressive. (Minus the fact that I felt like I was in an Italian restaurant because the way the table settings are arranged) it must be because that used to be the spot for the Marinellis restaurant which served Italian food.   We went there because they have a \"all you can eat sushi + free sake\" there's a catch... The menu is super reduced and poor and almost every roll is just pure rice and a lot of nothing inside! Maybe 8 different cut rolls and the most simple ones. The flavor wasn't there and the stiff staff didn't help. Oh and if you order another round of sake, they charge you! Only one free sake per person. The all you can \"kind of\" eat is at the bar so there's like a dozen of seats only.   There were no Japanese customers in the restaurant which says a lot about the authenticity of their food.   Sad but not coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered rolls at the bar to go and have to say very disappointed. We ordered California roll and it tastes very plain and sushi rice not so good.we also ordered the M girl roll or so we thought I get home and it's a rainbow roll!!!Don't really recommend this place for sushi you are better off outside of the hotel and find a hole in the wall with better quality tasting sushi."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, this is the first 1 star review I've ever given. That single sentence should speak for itself, but for those that prefer details please read on.  My girlfriend and I have been dying to try this place for sometime, the planets line up correctly and we decided to give it a go...   SERVICE-  We arrived at 5:30 on a weekday evening. the Hostess was friendly and somewhat prompt. as we we seated at our table, we noticed the Sushi bar was full but the dining room had vast seating. While the hostess selected for a very small table in direct sunset sunlight, we redirected her to a more spacious booth in a more comfortable area.  We were told the usual \"your server will be with you in just a moment\" ... 30 mins later no one had even taken our drink order. This wasn't because they were swamped, there may have been 8 tables occupied at the time, but because our server was more interested in being a social butterfly than attending to our table.  Once we complained, the Chef came out to apologize. Nice enough guy and I would've been alright with things except instead of acknowledging the poor service, he made the excuse for his staff that there had been a \"simultaneous seating\" which was FAR from true. At this point, I was truly looking forward to an exceptional and interesting meal. Oh the dreams of fools...  FOOD -  For Appetizers, we opened with the Grilled 5 Spice Lamb Chops and the Korean Street Tacos. Both were just okay. Not as much flavor as I was expecting/hoping for. Best thing was the salad that accompanied the Lamb Chops  Next we grabbed a couple of rolls of Sushi, The M Girl and a Geisha Girl. The sushi rolls were actually the best part of the meal and if by some odd twist of fate I end up in this place again, that is all I would have!  In the Rice/Noodles area we tried a couple of \"hard to get wrong\" basic dishes, Chinese Fried Rice and Pad Thai Noodles. Both of these dishes were horrible to the point of complaint. They were both flavorless and greasy/oily. Just really poorly prepared and we had them removed from the bill.  For entrees, we tried the Beef & Broccoli along with the Crispy Fried Tai Snapper. Both had potential, but the sauces used were just way too sugary and sweet. I swear, the sauce on the snapper tasted like a diluted, warmed, jam.  ATMOSPHERE  Most disappointing thing here wasn't even at our table, but directly in front of us. The hostess continued to seat patrons in a seating area where the refused to lower the blinds, though the dining area is surrounded by windows. We watched 3 sets of tables complain about the blinds while the 6:30-7:30 July western sun beamed down on them without mercy. No one in the establishment seemed to even care no matter what was said to them.  Enter this establishment only if want to extend a horrible night at the tables and make it even worse. Invested $150+ and gained the knowledge that I will never set foot in the place on my own accord again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best values in Las Vegas. The food is remarkably good, and the wait staff is friendly and efficient. It's all you can eat, but the food is prepared to order, so it's hot and fresh. I go here every time I'm in town and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"It was my husband's birthday, so his friend, him, and I go out to eat at Jayde since he loves sushi and has been dying to try this place out. We all order AYCE to make ordering much simpler. First, the AYCE menu is very very very limited. Dessert is not included as well. It's not like most AYCE sushi places where you can choose from most of the menu if not the entire menu.   Anyways, they have a sheet that you fill out with how many orders you want of this and that. We always keep track of what we're ordering and how much. We received at least three times the amount of nigiri that we ordered. We told our waiter, Georgio, this, and he blamed it on the kitchen staff. Okay... but then, we received twice the amount of rolls ordered, to which he blamed on our busser...in front of him. Poor guy! All he's done is fill our drinks & take empty plates away, not take our orders. Georgio has blamed everyone under the sea at this point but himself.   Finally it's time for the check. We are a part of 6, so we were charged an 18% gratuity fee - which is fine and expected in large parties. We explained to Georgio that we would need 4 separate checks (2 couples, 2 individuals), and he walked away to ring up our receipts. He comes back with 4 checks, but one of them being charged the 18% of the whole bill. So our friend is pissed that he's received the 18% & asked Georgio why it wasn't split up like we had asked. Georgio claimed that he could not put the 18% on everyone's bill, that it wasn't possible. So we asked for his supervisor, who didn't speak to us, only walked away with Georgio to ring up new receipts. 20 minutes later and the supervisor is still ringing up receipts, so the friend that was originally charged the 18% walked up to him & asked what was going on. The supervisor explained that our party never told Georgio to split the check and that we were in the wrong and that it was going to take a while to ring up new receipts with an 18% gratuity. Finally, we got our receipts, paid, and will never return.  We are avid sushi-goers and the sushi was not worth the drive, the waiter, or the money."}
{"text":"Fusion, a mix between mostly Americanized sushi and Chinese food.  This entire menu is all you can eat with no a la carte options.  Either get the $25 version of sushi and nigiri or their Jayde specialties- which are the Chinese inspired dishes.  If you want the mixture of the two, just pay about $7 more to order from either menu.    I opted for the sushi and nigiri and boy was I disappointed.  My first two rolls- Dragon roll and some eel roll, were all made with California roll and then topped with the various fishes based on the description.  I asked the waiter if there were any ones not California roll based and the manager was able to get about 6 rolls out of 12 options available.  Look, if you like sushi that comes from fast food or the like, you'll do fine here.  I was looking for a variety of sushi rolls with a little more refined taste, but apparently the price point should have led me to think California roll is standard.  Overload of teriyaki sauce in their rolls, no half orders available, this lends to a more wasteful environment than a tasting of the menu.  This was not a nice celebratory meal, but the ambiance and service were great.  5 stars for the service and Kirk was really awesome."}
{"text":"I typically avoid AYCE sushi restaurants. Actually this is only my second one but was highly recommended to me. The entrance to Jayde Fuzion is beautiful. It is nicely decorated and the sushi bar is in the back corner along the windows.   Jayde has 3 menus to choose from. All you can eat sushi ($24.95), all you can eat Chinese specialties ($24.95) or both for $32.95. The sushi was enough for us. All 3 menus include one small carafe of warm Sake. I did not care for it at all but I am not in to Sake.   The service overall was excellent. We arrived right at 5:00 when they opened and were of course seated immediately. You must sit at the sushi bar if you select the AYCE sushi menu. We were explained the menu and then given our included miso soup, cucumber salad and edamame. The miso was okay, I've had better.   We started with Hamachi, Toro and albacore sushi. We then ordered a spicy tuna roll, M girl roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese, cucumber, jalapeno) and surf & turf (Kobe beef and spicy tuna). The sushi was very good, tasted very fresh.   The rolls however were just really plain. The spicy tuna was not spicy and the M girl had barely any jalapeno flavor. The surf and turf also lacked much flavor. If I didn't know what was in the rolls I could not have told you. For dessert we had the chocolate banana spring rolls which were excellent. A small scoop of ice cream would have been a perfect addition.   The service and decor are great, but the sushi is very average and the menu is quite limited with only 10 rolls. I will continue to be loyal to my two favorite sushi places, neither of which are AYCE."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this place. The decor is awesome.   Here comes the bad news i guess if you dont drink alcohol at this restaurant you get bad and slow service. They wanted us out of there pretty quick the waiter took one of our plates before we finished, they took our dishes pretty quick. The food was bland i couldnt believe it.   Overall i would not suggest this place unless you order drinks first. Maybe i should of worn a suit and tie."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor was great. We came for the all you can eat sushi for $24.95 + one small sake per person. The sushi menu was limited to ten rolls, nigiri, and sashimi, but sashimi is not included with the deal. The first three rolls we ordered: Geisha, Surf and Turf, and Jayde Roll, which was pretty decent.  The next three rolls: Lady Luck, M Girl, and Rainbow, which was blah..."}
{"text":"We came here for AYCE - 24.95 plus free sake. * The AYCE menu is EXTREMELY limited: 9 small plates, 10 rolls, 10 nigiri choices (This is the wrost AYCE menu I have seen but then again I stay away from sushi in casinos.) * You get one large 'complementary' hot sake per person. (It was NOT hot; it was barely warm and cold after 10 minutes.)  Pros: The quality was good, not great. The rice was sticky.  Cons: * We could not tell the difference between the seaweed salad and cucumber salad. We had to ask the waitress which one was which. They were both 95% LETTUCE and rather nasty.. * Our waitress was not nice. * We tried ordering a second seaweed salad without dressing (thinking there might be more seaweed in this one...) and we received TWO cucumber salads. * The nigiri had A LOT of rice. So too did the rolls.  There are SO many better sushi places in Vegas, even if you have to pay for the sake! I think this is one of the worst sushi experiences I have ever had..."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was terrible! I will never comeback to this place ever again. Manager looked like he doesn't know what the hell he was doing and the server was all over the place. We asked them for a high chair for one of the kids, the server came back 30mins later and just placed it behind us and left. I would understand if it was busy but not much people were there. Just an overall bad experience."}
{"text":"The food was 4/5 The service was 3.5/5 The advertisement was a lie! 0/5 It stated \"all you can eat sushi and FREE sake\"  The lie is that you get 1 free sake.  So I told my server that I felt I was conned and he did nothing... But he did admit that MANY patrons before me have expressed the same.  If the ad specified ONE free sake I still would have gone and likely rated this place better.   But it clearly wasn't just the ad that was deceiving.  There are plenty of ayce sushi places in Vegas that won't lie to you.  And will probably charge less than $10 for sake.  Pass on this one!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for the all-you-can-eat sushi, but found you have to sit at the bar and there was limited seating.  At least the waiter mentioned that the undersized food was family style.  The service was all right, but I left feeling dissatisfied due to the overpriced food."}
