{"text":"I will return to this place for sure, but there were a few \"cons\" to our first visit. We really enjoyed the look of the place; it's a bit like you're eating in someone's very posh mountain cabin. There are some gas fire places, two bars, and plenty of outdoor seating as well. The servers' uniforms of jeans and tshirts sort of clashed with the aesthetic, but it is nice to see comfortable employees. 

I tried the elderflower seasonal cocktail and loved it: sort of a toned-down floral lemoncello. I also enjoyed the house salad (mixed greens with tomatoes, roasted red peppers, feta and oil) and the crabcakes were scrumptious (as was the aioli; love the hint of lemon!). If there was filler in there, I couldn't detect any! My partner, however, was disappointed that his burger came out much more well done than he had ordered. We both agreed the side of fries were almost inedibly salty. 

I ordered a lemon tart to-go, and when I opened the bag later, delightedly discovered a sort of assemble-your-own they'd put together so that the tart wouldn't get soggy. It included the tart, four little sauce cups (two with delicious lemon curd, one with minted blueberry, and one with pureed strawberry), four blueberries, and chips of sugared crust for garnish. I felt like I was playing with an easy-bake oven again (this is a plus in my book), and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great Dining experience. 730 reservations on a Saturday night. Seated promptly, waiter was attentive and informative. It was our first visit here so we followed his suggestions and it was spot on. Food was very good and atmosphere was great. A very good dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is locked out. Notice on the door. They haven't been paying their bills. That's sad. This used to be the best Tex-Mex place as far as flavour and value for the money goes. :(

However, as the previous reviewer said, the restaurant went through some changes, and not for the better, so while I'm very sad the place is closed down, I am not surprised. My favourite was the chimichanga, it used to come with rice and beans and salad. When the change came, salad was extra, the portion size shrunk, and the price went up well over a dollar. Too bad, so sad. I need to find another chimichanga. And don't suggest Hernandos. Not even close to the Willow Chimi pre-2005."}
{"text":"I have been eager to check out Willow for quite some time, and Pittsburgh Restaurant Week seemed like an excellent time to test their culinary chops.

They are conveniently located shortly off of 279 in a beautifully decorated building with both indoor and outdoor seating.  We chose to sit outside on the covered deck surrounded by well maintained flowers and plants & a wrought iron fence flanking the parking lot.  

We ate off both the PRW & normal menus and found several nice dishes we'd enjoy having again.  My husband enjoyed the halibut and I had a beautiful salmon with kalamata olive crust.  I also particularly enjoyed the chilled corn soup - to my surprise!  The Parker house rolls were delicious, of course, but the bacon butter didn't quite pack the flavor that we were anticipating.  We shared the fresh peach parfait, and while local summer peaches are always delicious, I could have made a better dessert for us a home.

Our server was polite, though not very attentive or friendly.  The other staff were quite pleasant and gracious, so he was definitely not the norm.  

My only complaint is the $15 corkage fee for BYOB.  Save yourself the money and drink your wine in the comfort of your own home - I wish we had!   

Overall, a great place to have a delicious meal.  We'll be back and will recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Food is very good but a little overpriced. Bar is also very nice as well. Service is good. Setting is very nice."}
{"text":"I went to Willow the first time for my birthday. The food was spectacular and service was great. The inside was nicely decorated and very clean looking. Would have loved to go outside but couldn't because of the weather. Only downside is it's pretty pricey. So I would definitely come back but for a special  occasion."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and tremendous small plates...definitely want to return for full menu!"}
{"text":"Finally Willow, You Nailed It!

I've been a frequenter to Willow for years and I've always been up and down on them.  The restaurant would have a great menu with great choices and then two months later switch up the menu entirely.  The restaurant would change owners, chefs, menus, and they never seemed to have an identity of where they would like to be or what cuisine they would like to specialize in.  The last time I went to Willow, the menu was almost exclusively BBQ and vowed never to go back.  It was a shame because the restaurant is nestled in a wooded area and the views and ambiance are fantastic.

However, I recently had read that Willow had undergone an ownership change (I believe it's the same group that owns BRGR) and had closed for sometime this past summer to re-invent itself.  All I can say is that they found their identity and I can only hope there will no longer be any reincarnations.  The experience was amazing!

Upon entering, the restaurant seemed pretty much the way I'd always remembered it.  The bar area was bustling and I could see some patrons dining in the downstairs seating area.  We had made reservations and were promptly taken upstairs to one of the back rooms.  We had a wonderful evening view of the wooded, snow covered terrain.  

We were then greeted by our server Victoria.  If you do one thing upon dining at Willow, request Victoria as your server.  She is fantastic at what she does and is highly skilled.  She is knowledgeable, friendly, and in no way overbearing.  It was the perfect server experience.  

However, our food was the star of the evening.  The menu has been scaled back to a one page offering.  There are a few items that you are able to order off the bar menu, burgers, sandwiches, salads, small and large plates.  They have a full drink menu of creative and tasty cocktails as well.  I started with the sangria and might be one of the best drinks I've ever had.  Not too sweet, not too dry, and full of delicious fruit.  Highly recommended!

For starters I ordered the scallops and pork belly small plate while my wife ordered the parker house rolls and olives.  My scallop and pork belly plate was unreal.  I could've ordered three of these.  The scallops were big, juicy and sweet.  The pork belly was salty, sweet, and melt in your mouth.  It was a wonderful combination and creatively presented.  For my wife, she loved the olives (I'm not an olive eater so I can't speak to how these were).  But the Parker House rolls were awesome.  The bread was warm and the butter that was served was room temperature for easy spreading.  Usually bread is included but these are $5.  For as good as these rolls are, I'd spend $5 on bread all day.

For our entrees, I decided on the Willow Burger and my wife got the lobster roll small plate with a side of fries.  I consider myself a burger connoisseur and I must say this was one of the best burgers I've ever had.  The meat was cooked to medium perfection and the brioche bun was fantastic.  For my toppings I decided on sharp cheddar, whiskey bacon jam (yes it is as decadent as you'd think) and crispy pork belly.  It was insane!  The burger was huge and I almost couldn't finish it.  But as good as it was, I was able to push through.  However, the fries were sacrificed due to how full I was.  I was able to eat a few and they are amazing.  They are crispy and have some sort of garlic and rosemary (I think) seasoning.  Very good!

My wife's lobster rolls reminded me of our vacation to Maine a few years back.  The lobster roll filling was filled with large chunks of lobster and served on a buttered bun.  She received two of them with homemade potato chips.  I had a small bite and although I'm not ready to say a Pittsburgh restaurant can do a lobster roll better than Maine, I will say it's not too far off from authentic lobster rolls in New England.  If you've never had a Maine lobster roll and wonder what it might be like, try the one at Willow and you'll have a really good idea.  

Overall, the experience was amazing and I emplore Willow to stick with the current recipe.  The food is excellent, the service is excellent, and the experience is more than worth it.  I wasn't sure if I'd ever return to Willow due to all the changes through the years and never having a true identity.  I can say with certainty this will be one of our go to restaurants from now on!"}
{"text":"Willow WAS a favorite restaurant of ours....and we were very excited it was reopening. However we were very disappointed with the \"new\" menu. Although they said the crab cakes were the same, and I've said they were the best in Pittsburgh, I've changed my opinion. They were soggy and tasted nothing like I've had in the past. My husband got the grouper....again nothing like the description and not worth the price. French Dip my dad got, also disappointing. The apple pear salad was delicious and the renovated space was the only thing I could say was good about the place. I don't understand why such a good restaurant had to get such a bad make over. I left with nothing that I would want to come back for."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located north of Pittsburgh, off of 279.  

Overall, this restaurant is a nice alternative for those who live in the area but aren't in the mood to drive down into Pittsburgh proper.  The ambiance is quite nice, with a bar area and lots of seating areas for sit-down dinners, with an outdoor area, an upstairs and downstairs.  There are also some private dining rooms for special events.

I personally found the food so-so.  It serves a mixture of new American and some Asian Fusion.  The crab cake is good when done well, which is not all the time.  Otherwise the appetizer list is pretty commonplace with the requisite fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip, and nachos among the choices.  

The entrees don't really add any further depth to the menu and can be pricey - $17 to 28 depending on what you order.  There is a more substantial seafood menu along with the more carnivore-friendly menu.  But the entrees are just - ehh.  

Personally, I wouldn't waste your time if you have the time and motivation to stay in Pittsburgh or to drive down there.  That being said, it certainly isn't bad and I could see myself there in the future if needed."}
{"text":"We have been to Willow a few times, and I have to say this last time, they have gone a \"little\" down hill.  Service was a little slower, and the food wasn't as \"terrific.\"  I thoroughly enjoyed my bacon-wrapped cod, and we all enjoyed our small plates (lobster rolls, etc.), but my husband and son did not enjoy their beef entrees.   

Overall, I love Willow, but sometimes it is \"hit or miss,\" with their food or service."}
{"text":"In all honesty I was expecting a wonderful experience and really good food going in and maybe my expectations were too high but Willow certainly did not meet them. 

First of all I have never been so uncomfortable by a waitress before. She pushed there new 5 course dinner like it was the only thing on the menu even after I said I was a vegetarian and it was mostly meat. Even when we said no to it she still pushed it and pushed it, it was so uncomfortable to order after that. When my boyfriend ordered the chicken she made references to it being just ok and how she has ate it over a dozen times and is sick of it. 

The food was alright. However the warm mushroom salad was so over salted I was sick from it, which seemed to be the theme of the night that most of the food was over salted. And the sticky toffee pudding was burnt on the edges. My boyfriend said his chicken was delicious though. 

I really wanted to love Willow going in but that was not the case unfortunately and since it is a little on the pricey side I was expecting much much better."}
{"text":"Food and service were just okay. We were seated in the dark portion of the restaurant. Too dark for a family with young teenagers, but apparently we didn't have a choice. We were hoping for more from this restaurant, but we got less. A lot less. It definitely was not a memorable meal. But for the price, it should have been."}
{"text":"Went here last week and had an excellent meal with friends and family the service was very very good Food was excellent and we all had a great time highly recommend this place.  Victoria was our server and she made us feel very much at ease and did not rush anyone.  I recommend the octopus appetizer."}
{"text":"I seriously can't believe this place only gets 3 stars from Yelp users. Incredible atmosphere, updated decor, friendly staff, strong mixed drinks, large selection of wines, And the food is amazing.  

Of course a strong price tag comes along with that----but for those who want a special night out or simply a NY style lounge experience in the rust belt city of PGH ---this place is GREAT"}
{"text":"Went to Willow for the first time with a friend, based on a recommendation from a co-worker.

The ambience, both indoor and out is just outstanding - among the best I've experienced.  It is beautiful, quiet, classy without being pretentious. 

I had to shift my reservation a couple of times due to a late flight and the phone staff were extremely accommodating.  This was mirrored by our server who was exceptionally friendly and professional.  We ended up being there after closing and never felt rushed or hurried.

The food was good, but a bit complex for my personal tastes.  I'd recommend for foodies, not so much for meat & potatoes types like me."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for a cocktail reception. We were upstairs. We had a wide variety of heavy appetizers. They were yummy."}
{"text":"Service at the bar sucks!!!!  20 minutes an no drink or food order!   Avoid if you are thirsty or hungry!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a large group. Service was good but the food was extremely overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Usually, not terrible. I would not recommend going on a night that the parking lot looks empty. Burnt tasting soup. Burnt, sitting for a while coffee, dry pork all are what come with a visit when they are not busy. From having a meeting and hearing all of the staff stand around the bar and talk, to hearing loud singing from the kitchen. This was far from worth it for a $122 bill for two people meeting. A shame and unprofessional. On an up note, the devil eggs are awesome."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. We had the Butternut squash ravs and hubby had the pork chop. Amazing. Drinks were great. Waitstaff cool and in the game. Can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"After being seated upstairs overlooking the parking lot and watching the valet guys parking the cars, that was scary enough! The room upstairs was kind of drab and stark and reeked of kerosene from the candles. I had to blow mine out because of allergies. We started out with some good salads and really good, fresh bread. I ordered the halibut which came served on what was some kind of mystery sauce. It was baked but had no flavor whatsoever. It also came with a tomato and some weird tasting onions. My husband got the black cod which had so much garlic that you couldn't taste the fish. It was so garlicky that he had to take some Tums when he got home. Usually when you order a dessert, they give you such a big serving that you can split it. Well, not with the toffee cake. It was a little round probably 3 inches in diameter with a teeny little scoop of vanilla ice cream for $7. It was hardly enough for ONE person! Our meal, not including tip, was $120! Willow is way overpriced for what you get and the food is terrible!"}
{"text":"Very reliably good imaginative food.  The butternut bisque is awesome when it's on the menu.  I've been here several times both personally and for work functions, and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be snobby or out of my price range, and I was pleasantly surprised. For some of the dishes, we have to ask them to omit an ingredient that our middle-class palates would find strange, like bacon whisky jam or other fancy stuff. It's pretty easy to customize and they're open to changing things up when you ask.  I like to have business meetings here because it's not noisy, it's always clean and the wait staff is pleasant."}
{"text":"My bridal shower was hosted at Willow and I cant think of enough great things to say about the place! The food was incredible and the staff couldnt have been more accomodating!  There was an issue with a blown transformer that caused half the restuarant to lose power, and most of our guests didnt even notice because they handled the situation so well! Everyone working there was tremendous and they made this such a nice occassion for me and my family! Thanks again. We hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"We have been to Willow many times and it always produces. The management and the servers are always kind and on top of things. The muscles are delicious and the French dip is always a favorite. We have tried many different things on the menu and they are all a little different which offers great choices. 
It's an excellent place for happy hour. Yuengling is only $2. The outdoor patio is a great place to enjoy the weather and conversation with friends. 
It's in a great location, about 5 minutes from 279. 
Definitely our go to and always recommend."}
{"text":"Not inexpensive but never disappointing, Willow has the best lobster gumbo I have ever had. It's spicy and loaded with lobster meat. Their crab cake is excellent and we always save room for dessert. I suggest the ice cream sandwich. Very good. My wife had the brisket taco but it was not so good. I tasted it and agree that I would pass on this one in the future. Otherwise, everything else we've ever eaten there was delicious. The outside dining area is worth checking out too."}
{"text":"i've been to the Willows a few times - it's always a good meal and drink.  the front of the restaurant is beautiful with a lot of metal work and ambiance, which diminishes as you walk into the eating areas.  the dining rooms are stark and clean and average, similar to the bathrooms.  the food was excellent, servings and portions delicious and just about right - with lots of vegetarian options (not vegan!) the waiter was EXCELLENT and always there just a second before needed - never and issue with service - great!!  i would give the service 5 stars if i could!

i was quite disheartened, however, when presented with styrofoam togo boxes.  this place makes money, A LOT of money, off of its patrons - i would think they would want to give back to the community a little and use compostable or recyclable togo boxes.  i also did not see any mention of free range, wild caught, or organic on the menu - not very Earth-friendly, and in that aspect a disappointment, and only three stars."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday and was very pleased from food to the staff!!! Food was great, nice to have something different from the chain restaurant. If your get the chance to try it, I suggest that you do!!"}
{"text":"We had our perfect wedding at Willow Restaurant! Brittany and Matt were very easy to work with and made the day of the wedding stress free. The food was amazing, and we received so many complements on the food choices and the service. We definitely recommend the newly remodeled venue and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the menu is full of promising mid-priced options.  I'd go back.  Voting 3 stars because I ordered the pork chop medium, but the thing was mostly dark pink and red inside; ate around it and took it home."}
{"text":"Ok food. Romantic/Modern-Eco ambiance (if there is such a thing). We came here for Mother's Day brunch. It was nice and the food was good but it was just ordinary standard brunch food and they didnt have anything special or anything that made their brunch stand out from any other restaurants.  Oh, and yes, like the other reviews stated, it is a bit overpriced.  They also gave me some fizzy berry drink that they claimed was a Bellini but the last time I checked, a Bellini was Prosecco with peach nectar but what do I know. Service was good but like I said, this was brunch :-/. I'll give them a try for dinner next time I'm back in town."}
{"text":"We chose Willow to host a dinner party of 15 adults in celebration of my wife's 40th birthday. What an excellent decision! Drinks, food, service, accommodations, everything was absolutely fantastic. 
They put us in a very comfortable private room upstairs. The service was not rushed and far from slow. The food was some of the best we've had. Charcuterie, kale salads, deviled eggs, lobster rolls, filets, pork chops, burger, everyone loved the foods they ordered. Great creative drinks. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had New Years Eve dinner at Willow.  It was outstanding.  The service was wonderful (thanks Kylene) , friendly and attentive and the chef offered an exciting menu.  We had the ribeye and salmon entrees. Both had exceptional sides.  We've been there on other occasions  where it was more casual but equally good.  It has a relaxed comfortable rustic atmosphere with a varied menu.  Perfect for a special occasions of just a weeknight out."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Always have a great meal and wonderful drinks! The service is always spot on especially sitting at the bar! A shout out to bartender Alana who waited me recently....I feel like calling in for her schedule so I can go there every time she is working! Definitely a favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and the surrounding area!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere I love the sitting areas by the bar comfy and cozy. Great place for a date!"}
{"text":"I had been here on a couple of occasions before for either lunch or a work function, both of which times the meal was pretty good. I drive by here regularly and one of the most compelling things about this restaurant is the overall layout. A unique layout, nice remodeling, and fireplaces here and there.

For some reason I couldn't pick a time slot on OpenTable (lots of slots available) so I called for reservations. The hostess said she couldn't seat four until very late. I informed her there are multiple slots online and with a bit of a huff, she placed our reservation. I wasn't happy about this, but it was the only problem on the night.

To start, we decided on a cheese/charcuterie plate, deviled eggs, hot chicken, and the tuna poke small plates (for a group of 4). The perfect amount of food, and all 4 were outstanding. The highlight is the house cured charcuterie with some wonderful local honey.

For dinner I had the proclaimed \"best pork chop in Pittsburgh,\" which frankly might've been right. It came with halusky with some extra wide egg noodles. My wife was drinking a specialty tequila cocktail that she enjoyed and they poured me a wonderful Old Fashioned.

We spent about $55 per person + tip which was reasonable overall, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Willow three times. Once for lunch, dinner, and once for a friend's wedding. Each time I was thoroughly impressed. Their menu is comprised of inspired dishes and they do all the little things right that separate good restaurants from great ones. Definitely one of my new favorite spots in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. A little on the pricy side but well worth the evening, food and atmosphere. The artichoke dish is to die for Unfreaking believable!"}
{"text":"Let me start with...Victoria was awesome! She was there for awhile, and it showed. We decided to get 3 small plates and a side for dinner, and we are so happy we did that. We got the deviled eggs, the lobster roll bites, and the crab cake along with the french fries. Everything was delicious, and we left nothing on the our plates. We would go back and maybe get the same things again. We listened to Victoria's suggestion and got the Willow Bar for a sweet treat...WOW. A wonderful dinner and night."}
{"text":"Nashville hot chicken and Hanger Steak are delicious, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Willow has always been one of my favorite restaurants. However, the menu has changed and is now a bit limited. The decor is clean, upscale and inviting. The food was perfectly prepared and was very good. The fish was fresh and flavorful. The reuben sandwich was prepared with tender corned beef. Our server was polite, but not very attentive. After he asked if we had any questions about the menu, I asked him a basic question about the vegetables. The server replied that he really wasn't sure, but he made no effort to find the answer for me. He filled our glasses with water, but never offered us any other drinks. The server asked if we wanted to order dessert, but he made no specific recommendations."}
{"text":"I've been to Willow a few times for various functions.  The waiters and chefs at willow are always very willing to check, double check, triple check/ alleviate gluten fears about different dishes.  For the most part I think the only real \"con\" to Willow is that it is located on a slightly \"blind turn\" in the road that can get backed up if traffic is heavy.  Parking is vast both to either side of the restaurant and behind ( and I am a sucker for great parking).  When you enter there appears to be a cute bar area ( that one day I will venture into).  In general it looks like larger functions are done upstairs.  It is pretty nice and posh upstairs.
The food itself is delicious.  They were able to provide a gluten free greek salad with salad dressing and a steak and potato entree.  For desert they had a rhubarb raspberry ice cream with fresh raspberries.  
Its a great time, the staff doesn't pressure you to leave and the food is tasty.  I will be coming back."}
{"text":"All the wasted years!

So I was trying to find somewhere different to take my wife for our Wedding Anniversary as we have been to most of the usual suspects and I remembered Willow from the Pittsburgh Magazine Best Restaurants Party. I read some of the Yelp reviews and knew this was the place. I easily made reservations thanks to the Open Table App.

As soon as we pulled up I knew this place would be good! Not only by the almost completely full parking lot to the sweet aromas bellowing out from the kitchen. Once inside we were greeted and told Happy Anniversary by the hostess and taken to our table.

A few minutes later our waiter came over to take our drink orders. I went with the Mexican War Streets. It featured Tequila, Aperol, Grand Marnier, Thyme, lime and sugar and the wife had the Gina Marie which featured Pimm's No. 1., strawberry, rhubarb, sugar, lime and house ginger beer. My cocktail was delicious and very refreshing and she enjoyed hers as well.

For small plates we started with the Roasted Pork lettuce wraps served on Bibb Lettuce and topped with carrot and cucumber slaw and a spicy aioli. We love lettuce wraps and these were delicious. Next we chose the crab cake. It came served with aioli, cucumber and a nice Chesapeake Vinaigrette. And for our third and final small plate we chose the famous Parker House Rolls which come topped with not only bacon salt but have bacon butter on the side! C'mon Son! Who does that?! They are a must order from now on!

For my main entree I chose the Ribeye. It came served with roasted garlic butter, bone marrow, mushroom, charred corn risotto and was topped with parsley. It was simply amazing! One of the best steaks I have ever had in my life. it was so tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. The bone marrow, mushrooms and risotto were the perfect companion to the steak as all of the flavors worked in perfect harmony with one another. My wife chose the Steak and Frites which featured Hanger Steak severed with creamed spinach, house cut fries, a bistro salad and topped with a Béarnaise sauce. She loved her food also. We only ate a little of our entrees as we were pretty full from the small plates we had.

Upon telling our waiter that we were done with our entrees and wanting them packed up and that we were celebrating our anniversary he insisted on offering us a complementary dessert. We chose the Willow Bar which was spectacular! I don't know how they do it but, each food item got better as the night went on leading up to the grand finale with the Willow Bar. 

The food and service were superb the entire evening. Willow defiantly needs to be on your to try list if you haven't been yet. Until next time...."}
{"text":"Solid, go to place in the North Hills. Food is really great, though I tend to order their burger because it is GREAT!  The whiskey jam is a must order. Decor is contemporary and spotless. Staff is friendly and helpful and know their menu well. If there are any negatives, I feel their daily menu specials tend to be a bit over priced. Also, thing twice about sitting outside as Camp Horne Road can be somewhat noisy."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and waiter top notch,gave a 4 star because of the seating.Place was almost empty and seated by kitchen/bar/garage door area??"}
{"text":"Good food but took some time to come out when we were the only ones there during a weekend lunch"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate their this past Valentine's Day. Atmosphere was nice as its been newly renovated. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Food was great. We had the pork chop and salmon. Nice beer and wine selection. I would suggest a space heather in the lobby as you wait for your call to be pulled around."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week with some friends and I am impressed by the facility! The building is large and the space really had an upscale, yet relaxing type of vibe. 

Of the dishes I ordered and sampled, my favorite of the night would be the Scallop Moussiline: the textures and flavors were well-balanced. My least favorite was the farm chicken as it was too heavily salted, making it rather unappetizing. All the other dishes were decent but not entirely memorable. 

Overall, I liked my experience here more than the average restaurant. If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely consider stopping in to try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"So underwhelmed by The Willow. Family told us that it was not great, but we live so close we thought we would give it a try. The food was just ok. I think the worst part was just our waitress who was really very awful :("}
{"text":"Went last Friday and never got past the door.  At just after 6:00 pm, the patio had 3 occupied tables, and the dining room, a few more than that.  There were 3 slouchy employees at the front desk, one of whom was clearly kitchen staff.  We asked for a table, and were told snottily that there were a lot of reservations, and if we didn't have one, the wait was 90 minutes (!).  The place was more than half empty!  When we weren't even directed to the bar, I knew we were dealing with inexperienced, under supervised hosting staff.  It just seemed like we were interrupting their conversation and annoying them.

We won't try again."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday this year. We sat by the fireplace in the room off of the bar. It looks like the outside wall is a garage door, so this could be opened in the summer. The decor was nice (I think they just redecorated). The food was AMAZING. 

I had (and shared): 

lobster rolls- they were huge! A little less flavor than I would have liked, but still good. The chips that comes with them were really good salty and vinegary.

Tuna flatbread- really good. It is a weird combination, but it worked well. It is like sushi on pizza... 2 of my favorite things!

mussels in curry- really well prepared, not gritty at all. I wished that the sauce was thicker. They came with garlic bread that was to die for.

Beer cheese soup without bacon- If I could bathe in this and never eat anything else again, I would be a happy girl. I love beer cheese soup, and this was one of the best I have ever had. LOVE LOVE LOVE. I did not share any of this soup. It was delicious and ALL MINE.

The BF had the above and:

Hangar steak done filet style- So this was the hangar steak with the filet toppings and sides. He said it was good, but we were so stuffed after the small plates that he didn't eat most of it til the next day.

Dessert chocolate cake... Sadly, this one was Meh. Not great. Not even really good. It made me so sad."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I had made reservations at this restaurant for Valentines day. I was looking forward to coming in that night as I was looking a few days earlier at the menu online. On the menu that they had online, they had advertised a surf and turf ( steak with a lobster tail) which looked delicious.
When finally getting to the restaurant that night, the menu for vday was now changed. Seeing they still had the steak, but now had to add a lobster tail for $16 extra.
I asked our waiter about this, he just stated \"it is what it is\". 
I thought, okay Im disappointed but not going to let that ruin our night.
After ordering, we noticed that it was taking such a long time for our meals to arrive( the other two couples that arrived 20 later an us already had received their dinners). I asked our waiter what was taking so long - no answer, just \"its coming\".

When finally receiving our meals, my boyfriend very much enjoyed his pork chop he received, mine on the other had was way over cooked (i asked for medium).
To make it even worse, we received our bill and asked our waiter if he had change ( we were paying with card but wanted our waiter to have a cash tip)
He just said no rudely and walked away.
Im glad other people had good treatment at this restaurant but for us, we will take our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Willow is tucked into a bend on Camp Horne Road just over the hill from our house.  It's on the higher end of price so we don't frequently eat there but since we are shopping around for a venue to hold a very important life event party, we thought we'd swing by to see what they've been up to with their renovations since we were last there a few years back.

The space is beautiful and relaxing.  The service was very good.  Tables are closer together so you can sort of eavesdrop if something really interesting is going on next table over. Not that WE ever would, mind you.  

Their signature cocktail menu is varied and interesting.  I have never seen a cocktail with mezcal, carrot juice, turmeric, honey and lime.  I wasn't in the mood for tequila so I opted for a Caldwell Old Fashioned that was really delicious.  My partner tried the Moscow Mule but the house made ginger syrup they use in the drink is wayyyyyy too sweet and we asked for added soda to cut it.  The waitress was quick to fix it.  We heard some folks at the next table make the same complaint about two of the champagne (bubbly) drinks - too sweet.  I had a Dale's Pale draft with my meal and it was fresh and delightful.

For starters, we tried some beans and greens with sweet sausage.  The dish was good and well seasoned and the sausage was a nice addition. I tried the special, a NY Strip steak, with fingerling potatoes and broccoli that was monstrous in size and perfectly cooked and seasoned. I ate every last bite of mine.  My partner had the GINORMOUS pork chop that was browned on all sides and lightly braised with a rich complementary sauce and plated with some au jus.  It was very juicy and came served with a side napoleon stack made with sweet potatoes slices layered with béarnaise and herbs presented as a delicate square.  It was very good as well.  

This was a very good meal and the price was not outrageous for the level of food we received.  I think the bill, before tip, was $105 for two.  Their event spaces upstairs look super nice, by the way.  One even has a full bar in the event room and a cute outside deck."}
{"text":"Good for drinks but the food is too expensive for the quality. Willow will not be a top pick of mine for the area. On a positive note, its a great venue for showers  or private events."}
{"text":"I could write pages about the fantastic quality of the food here, but I will try to keep this brief. The crab cakes are delicious, and my steak was perfectly cooked. The service was attentive and the waiter very familiar with the menu. I don't drink much but from what my companions reported the drinks there are very strong. 

The taste of the meal still lingers in my dreams, beckoning me to return. And I will."}
{"text":"This is probably the 4th time that my husband and I have been to Willow, and 3 out of 4 times the food has been pretty bad. We recently moved to the area and hoped our experience tonight would be as good as our last. We were wrong. The service was slow and she seemed annoyed. Outside of the mussels, our food was not good. Overly salted and seemed like leftovers from the weekend that were reheated. To boot, Willow is not at all inexpensive. Needless to say it was officially our last time visiting. Way overpriced for way below average food."}
{"text":"This review might be a little premature, because I have yet to try the food here.  I did, however, take time to swing in for a beer and to check out the menu.  

First thing I noticed is the ambiance of the place.  I feels upscale and rustic at the same time.  Very inviting atmosphere.  The bar is central as you walk in the door, and the bartender was quick to get me set up with a libation.  

Next time I'm out that way, I intend to make a special trip to Willow Restaurant.  I'll let you know how that goes..."}
{"text":"First, make sure you have a reservation on the weekend (not sure about the weekdays); otherwise you will be seated at the bar or the high top tables in the bar area.  
 
Very nice decor; haven't been here in years since it was called Mardi Gras.  

Food was very good.  We did the small plates, appetizers.  Started off with the antipasti plate with cured meats, olives & more.  Very good!  Next up was the lobster bites.  They were superb! You get 2 of these cute mini buns overstuffed with lobster goodness.  And lastly was the crab cake.  Very disappointed in the fact that it had an extremely fishy taste. The aioli sauce was good and it was nice not having a lot of breading in the crab cake.  Also had some type of pear for dessert which was quite tasty.  Server very knowledgeable.

Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We went there for Valentine's Day this year.  The atmosphere was cozy and romantic, and I think my steak was even better than at Morton's.  Would definitely go there again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this location last night and was pleasantly surprised! I thought the restaurant was warm and inviting. We sat next to a fireplace which I loved. Everything looked clean. They appeared to have a large outdoor section. The wait staff was very knowledgeable both about drinks and the menu. The only thing we noticed that was a little bit off about the atmosphere was the loud noises coming from the second level. At times it sounded like they were duck pin bowling upstairs.

 We started off with fish tacos ($12) and lobster bites ($16) for appetizers. The fish tacos came in a wonton shell which was different but in a good way. They came with a spicy sauce on them. I am a huge fan of spicy and enjoyed the sauce but it definitely overpowered the other flavors. You couldn't really taste the fish. However, I thought they were delicious. The lobster bites were also a nice treat. They come as four little lobster sandwiches. I am not usually a fan of lobster but I have to say they were tasty. Maybe not $16 tasty but good none the less. 

For entrees my boyfriend ordered the duck ($29). It was pretty basic. A smaller rectangular plate with a bed of farrow and sliced duck. He had ordered medium and it came out rare. After a few bites he sent it back to be cooked a bit more. I ordered a steak meal ($25). My meal definitely blew his out of the water. It included a generous amount of the most well seasoned fries I've ever had, a salad, creamed spinach, and the most tender steak I have ever eaten.  It was cooked as ordered and everything was amazing. 

We did have a few drinks which were pricey expected. We also ordered a desert to take home, a willow bar. I am not actually sure what the desert was because it appears we may have smashed it in the car. I believe it was some kind of mousse. It came with a container of chocolate and whipped cream for dipping. Crushed or not it tasted fantastic! 

We would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for a special lunch or dinner.  The seafood selection is always fresh and the menu has a large variety to offer.  Can't go wrong with the funnel cake for desert!"}
{"text":"The food was fine (had the cranberry chicken which was good and gf had the shrimp which neither of us was very impressed with) but the service was terrible. We waited about 10 minutes before the waitress noticed us in the first place, then we waited another 10 minutes before our drinks (a beer and a cider) were out (we heard the bartender ask the waitress about the drink over five minutes before it actually got brought to us by a host), and then the waitress took our orders and AFTER we had both given our order and told her we didn't want soup or salad she then tells us the soup of the day. I spent 6 years waiting tables and I know it can be a challenging job but I simply would not expect to be forgot about like that in a restaurant where I drop about $100 on a two-top. Probably not going to return."}
{"text":"Went to Willow last night. I know about it's 4 (at present) sister restaurants downtown, and decided to try this outlier for a friend's birthday. We sat downstairs, and there was more than ample distance between tables for privacy. This is a large restaurant, and they have the nice option to sit outside on a patio.

I started with a Smoke & Honey cocktail - Vodka/Amaro/Smoked Honey/Lemon/Egg White. It was served in a martini glass, and I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it was truly delicious - a very unique combination, although the I think the Amaro's bitter contribution was lost.

My companion and I wanted to sample a little of the menu, and figured we'd try a \"small plate.\" I asked the waitress about how the Lobster Roll Bites and the Fried Artichoke were served, to see which was better to split. We decided on the latter. We were each given a heavy, rectangular porcelain plate from which to serve from the main plate. The app consisted of 4 small battered artichoke heart sections and 4 squares of fried prosciutto placed upon a smear of pea puree with scattered English peas and a few small star-squirts of lemon aioli. The menu mentioned asparagus, but none was there, replaced I assume by a small vine of pea shoots. No mint as written either. Fried artichoke and fried prosciutto, which packs a very powerful tail-end salt punch, is a bit heavy-handed use of the deep fryer, but no oil was detectable. And when Willow calls this a \"small\" plate, they mean it. Every component was artfully arranged, but with this finger food, you'd think they could do away with the idea of separate plates. And at $10, it's priced twice what it should be.

My \"large plate\" entree consisted of a nice-sized square of Scottish salmon broiled perfectly, with a chip of fried salmon skin sailing on top. The seafood was placed on top of a mushroom crepe, and around the plate were scattered tiny nicely-cooked  pattypan squash and baby zucchini. I would have used something a little less mushy under the fish, but it tasted fine. I could not detect the ramp pesto or pickled ramps mentioned on the menu, but this fufu veggie du jour just ends up sounding like a construction detour anyway. My companion ordered the \"large plate\" pork tenderloin, which consisted of 4-5 bacon wrapped medallions nicely cooked with a sweet onion emulsion, and sides of grilled succotash and \"compressed\" nectarine wedges. 

All in all the, the dinner was fine - pretty and all. But I guess I'm starting to prefer more simple food simply prepared at better value. I can really find no fault with my dinner at Willow - service was pleasant and diligent (though my companion's request for a steak knife for her pork should have been anticipated) and meal was enjoyable. I just wasn't wowed."}
{"text":"Nothing like a picturesque drive through the back roads of the North Hills to get you ready for a delicious brunch. Seriously - what a beautiful setting! Willow is beautiful inside and out. As soon as I walked inside I was hit with a relaxing, yet chic atmosphere. The brunch menu is amazing and includes standards such as omelettes and pancakes, but unique additions like the Crab Cake Benedict and Duck Confit Tacos. I split two entrees with one of my brunch buddies - the Crab Benedict and the Pancakes. Half of the Crab Benedict was enough in itself and was absolutely perfect. The pancakes were stuffed with peaches and topped with whipped cream. As pretty as they were, they did lack a bit of flavor, at least in the cakes themselves. The group ordered a combination of tacos, shrimp and grits and omelettes, and no one left hungry. The bottom line is, Willow is worth the drive and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I recently had dinner at Willow with some friends and family who live in the area.  

Overall the experience was both disappointing and expensive.

The restaurant features an expansive bar area in a modern design space complete with couches and a fireplace.  It's nice space, and I wouldn't mind going back to Willow for drinks only.  The bar menu had a nice list of house specialty drinks, several of which were enjoyed by female members of our party, and they offered a reasonably good selection of high-quality imported and domestic ales and lager.  On a cold night, I could definitely see myself enjoying a cognac in front of the fireplace (if only hypothetically, since I live in the city and wouldn't drive all the way out to the suburbs to enjoy a drink).

We started with the crab cake appetizer and it was a pretty good crabcake - moist, packed with lump crab, containing little or no bread crumb filler, and it came with a nice bright citrus cream sauce.  Several members of our party had salads, they all looked fresh and well-composed, especially the Cesar salad.  

Unfortunately the entrees were universally bad.  I had a rib-eye that was billed as \"dry aged\" and served wtih a \"bubbling Maytag Bleu au gratin\".  The menu description led to me to expect excellent dry-aged steak with a side of potato gratin that incorporated blue cheese.  Both the taste, which was non-noteworthy, and the fact that the interior was very brightly colored led me to wonder if the steak was, in fact, properly dry-aged.  I'd be willing to bet that my steak was not dry aged, an assertion that seems to be supported by the fact that Willow changed their menu description of this entree soon after my dining experience there and dropped \"dry-aged\" from the menu description of this dish.

The \"bubbling Maytag Bleu au gratin\" was simply a salty, stogdy, gooey, heavily caramelized, mess of blue cheese melted on the top of my steak.  It was very unappealing, and I ended up scraping it off of my steak.  The really shameful aspect of the dish, however, were the straight-from-the-freezer-bag-into-the-fryolater french fries.  For a $34 dish, I'd expect fresh-cut fries.  The fries were tepid, limp, and disgusting.  I've had better french fries in a hospital cafeteria.  $34 for this mess of a dish?  No thank you.

Two members of our party had pasta entrees.  There were unremarkable and seemed a poor value given their reletively high price (all in excess of $20).

Service was good, with the exception of wine service.  I ordered a 2004 bottle of Spanish wine, and was served a 2005 vintage.  When I asked about the vintage, I was told that the restaurant was out of 2004.  When I asked if there was a price difference, I was told that  there wasn't.  I then asked if the price on the wine list was for the 2004 or the 2005 vintage, and my server was unable to provide an answer.

Our bill for 4, including a bottle of wine (~$45) and before dinner drinks, with tip, totaled close to $300.  That's an awful lot of money for such unappealing and poorly-executed food.

I could have done far better in my own kitchen.  Next time, I'll cook myself, or try another restaurant, rather than spend my money at Willow."}
{"text":"The service we revived was outstanding, and very attentive. The food was amazing and served very appealing on its dishes. I also found the prices were very fair. I would highly recommend Willow for a evening out with that special someone."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out because I'd heard good things. The atmosphere is really nice and cozy with fireplaces throughout. However that's about as good as it got. The old fashioned I ordered tasted like straight vermouth. Then the charcuterie board we got while full of meats and cheeses was pretty bland. The Merlot and then the malbec my fiancé got were also pretty boring with not much flavor to them. Then we got the lobster roll bites which tasted like the lobster came out of a can and was placed on the hot buns. Loved the look and location of this place but unfortunately with the poor food and drinks I will not be returning anytime soon"}
{"text":"I finished my 2013 Winter Restaurant Week at Willow, and I have to say, it was a surprisingly wonderful capstone. Not that I expected it to be bad or anything, but I ate a lot of great food that set the bar quite high all through the week. That Willow managed to top that bar is really saying something.

Willow is definitely a place you dress up to go -- it's elegant, with light that's low but does not challenge the eyes, and sturdy, dark hardwood floors.

I warmed up with a tasty gin drink called \"Heaven's Punch\" -- followed shortly thereafter by another. I wanted to try other drinks, because there were about half a dozen that spoke to me, but the Heaven's Punch was just so tasty that I decided to keep things consistent.

My first course was a delicious Kobe Beef tartar on crispy wonton wrappers with a miso vinaigrette and avocado puree. It was a fantastic blend of textures and flavors that totally satisfied.

I followed this up with shrimp drizzled in a miso caramel, with grilled scallions and a chilled noodle salad. Originally, this was going to come with braised pork belly instead of shrimp, but I think the shrimp actually works better with the drizzle they provided. The sweet-and-salty miso caramel might have been too much with the fatty richness of a pork belly, but with shrimp it was a great compliment.

For my entree, I had a thick sirloin steak, grilled to a perfect medium-rare. It was paired with wild rice and okra, as well as a lobster sauce with meaty succulent chunks of lobster tail in it.

Every course was served with perfect timing; our server did a great job being nearby, but still out of the way -- and he never did the \"I'm going to check in just as you've taken a big sloppy bite of something\" trick, which I'll admit, in my earlier life as a waiter, I performed with glee.

We wrapped up with coffee and dessert -- also excellent. My dessert was called \"Apples, Peaches, Pumpkin Pie,\" the highlight of which was a pumpkin pie mousse with Kahlua-infused whipped cream and candied pumpkin seeds.

Yes, Willow is a bit pricey, but it would be a terrific place for a special occasion or \"date night.\" I enjoyed every minute of my time there."}
{"text":"Only has 3.5 stars because of reviews like \"I couldn't get in on a Friday night.\" Make a reservation then? Went with a party of 6 and had a great time. Good cocktail menu, solid sandwiches and great small plates and entrees, all for reasonable prices. Everyone enjoyed their meals. The cider brined pork chop was my favorite. Only complaint is that a medium rare steak was ordered and it was barely even rare. Will definitely be visiting again to try the burger."}
{"text":"Went to Willow for the first time today and won't be back.  Expensive and disappointing.  Went for a late lunch so there was only one other couple there (on the patio).  We waited at least 15 minutes to be greeted by our waiter who advised us he was \"new\" and didn't see us.  We were also outside on the patio around a corner.  He knew nothing about the house wine yet alone the wine list.  When asked about the dressing on the house salad he said vinegarette but it was some kind of creamy vinegarette, heavy on the vinegar.  We were never asked if we wanted bread and it never came.  We both got the \"large plate crab cake with vegetables\".  When it arrived we did get a very large plate indeed, literally.  The plate was huge with a delicious crab cake smaller than a hockey puck.  The \"vegetables\" was a lump of some kind of green, that was extremely bitter in spite of being doused in butter.  The greens were not fresh as they were turning brown and were left on the plate.  When queried by our waiter how everything was we told him about the greens.  He said he would tell the cook but it ended there.  All of this for $30.00!!  We were both hungry when we left so we went to subway and split a sub.  Good luck with your visit to Willow."}
{"text":"I bit down on a piece of plastic in the middle of enjoying a delicious butternut squash and goat cheese ravioli dish I ordered. My server was very nice about and offered to bring me more food but the manager never came out to apologize. They only compensated my meal that had the piece of plastic, still charging for my date's meal and our two drinks. 

The worst thing is the piece of plastic tells me their food comes in frozen plastic packages from a restaurant supply company -which is fine if you're eating at Applebee's, but not when you're paying $20 for ravioli."}
{"text":"We stopped by passing through to Missouri  and LOVED everything!  The crab cakes were the best i've ever tasted, the kale salad superb, the flat bread yummers.  i wish there were one in St. Louis.  

L. Baumstark   6/12/15"}
{"text":"After several years of hearing great things about Willow, we finally made it there for dinner on a Sunday evening with some good friends.  

The building surprised me.  I don't know.  With a name like Willow and being located out in the North Hills, I expected something open, airy and with views of fields or hillsides.  What I found a dark, 1970s style restaurant design.   The building is surrounded by a parking lot.   

We enjoyed our food.  Fresh, well done and creative, but nothing really special.  Well, except for the funnel cake which I could not stop eating.   But the meal just wasn't something I'd trot all the way from the East End to visit again.

One thing bothered me all evening: the table leg I kept bumping into.  No matter how I tried to maneuver around my legs around the table leg, I just could find a clear place.  At the end of the dinner, lifted the tablecloth and discovered that we were seated a plastic folding table with collapsable metal legs.  Granted, the table was dressed with a cloth tablecloth, but plastic folding tables??!??!

If I lived nearby, I might make this I'd dine at once or twice a month, but it's not worth the schlep from our current home."}
{"text":"The food at Willow was good. I really enjoyed their crab cakes and herbed french fries. They were generous heaps of crab cake goodness and a lovely portion of perfectly seasoned french fries. My husband ordered the Willow Burger and thought it was good as well. They also have a small patio that makes for a great place to dine in the summer.

The only shortcoming from my experience was the server. He wasn't the most personable/friendly guy and his service was a little lacking. The willow burger includes 2 toppings and 1 cheese. Which is fine, but then the server asked if he wanted lettuce or tomato as these are not offered on the menu for the 2 toppings. He said lettuce, then also asked if raw red onion was possible. The server said yes, but it would be an up-charge. My husband agreed. On the bill we were charged for lettuce and onion at 25 cents a piece. The burger didn't arrive with an onion, but instead just lettuce and tomato. Besides them not getting the order right, it just seems strange to me to charge for lettuce, tomato and onion...these should be standard included toppings for a burger and charging for them just makes the restaurant seem stingy. 

Another incident was when my husband paid with cash and rather than return the change, the server kept it as his tip. We were going to give him that cash anyway, but it just seems like a common courtesy to bring the change back to let the customer decide to leave it in the folio. 

Otherwise though, our experience was good and I'd be willing to try again as all of our complaints were based on a single server."}
{"text":"Great food- American Fusion- fun and trendy atmosphere.  Moderately slow service, but in pace with the ambiance. Pricy."}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner at old reliable Willow because our first choice, the new Nicky's Thai, was jammed. Willow was good, as always. We each had the lobster bites, one with chips, one with a salad. Service was prompt and professional even though the restaurant was crowded and loud. You can always count on Willow for a good experience."}
{"text":"We hosted a bridal shower at Willow and it was the perfect venue!  The restaurant is so beautiful and tastefully decorated. The food- my goodness, i worked in the service industry for over 7 years and I have never had buffet food so high quality and delicious. And our server made the entire experience wonderful.  She was so kind and professional, and we were never without a moment where she wasn't tending to our needs. 
We honestly couldn't have been happier with how it turned out.  I am excited to share our experience with others, and we wish them continued success!"}
{"text":"I recently went here on a double date. The place is beautiful. It is a little pricy, but that is to be expected. They have some signature drinks which were very good. My girlfriend had wine. The crab cakes were some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Chicken Caesar Salad was also very good. Our server was pretty quick and attentive. There were some times when she wasn't around, but we were having good conversation so it wasn't a big deal. We were thinking about dessert, but didn't end up getting any because of the server not being around when finished. everyone liked their dishes though and we probably didn't need dessert any way. I would return."}
{"text":"Willow is a very nice restaurant. I've never been on a busy night, so I've always found a comfortable seat either at the bar or in the outdoor dining area. We went on a warm sunny afternoon. We sat outside. I ordered the kale salad with pecans, goat cheese, and grilled chicken. Dressing was housemaid and delicious. My husband ordered the Beef tartare, he said it was delicious, he also ordered the deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were made with truffle oil, not one of my favorites, but they looked wonderful. His tartare presentation looked nice as well. Our server, I wish I could remember his name, was very knowledgeable. This restaurant definitely cooks food from fresh ingredients, which I absolutely love. You know when you have a house made dressing, that most of the food is cooked from real ingredients. I like that it's located near giant eagle and Home Depot. We can stop by for a glass of wine or beer after shopping at Home Depot. They also serve brunch. I have read the menu and am looking forward to a \"cooked from fresh ingredients brunch\" with mimosas or bloody Mary. I highly recommend this very nice dining establishment."}
{"text":"We've had really good food here recently -- I think it has gotten better than a few years ago.  The service is always good and knowledgable and the menu is creative and interesting.  Prices are reasonable -- not cheap but not over-the-top.  Try the charcuterie for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and I couldn't be happier. I had been wanting to check out Willow for a long time and I'm glad I finally got to go. Long story short, try the beef tartare, bacon and egg and pork chop (best in the city). My only complaint was the couple next to us was ridiculously loud but with food this good I could care less!  

Go, leave now!"}
{"text":"Very good food & service, but odd prices. The meals two of us got were reasonably priced, the one was crazy expensive for what it was (tiny portion), the beer was insanely cheap, & the mixed drink was pricey. 

Not sure what we got was worth the cost, but it was decent, in spite of the ketchup that was NOT Heinz. Not going to rush back for dinner, but we've heard the brunch is really good, so we'll probably try that one of these days."}
{"text":"The beef tartare was pretty amazing. Three generous slices of bread topped with generous amounts of diced beef.  This is definitely a must try.  

The curry mussels were  also tasty. Mussels were bit dry, but the sauce was good.  They topped it with these microgreens and these red peppers of sort that were pretty much el diablos.  They also provided toasted bread that came burnt :-/

The salmon was also delicious.  My friend asked for no salt if possible and they were really accommodating.  The entree also cam with this potato pancake with dill that she did not like but I tolerated.  She also got a side of green beans, that were $7... which is a lot for a tiny dish of french green beans sauteed in oil and garlic.  

The rabbit and dumplings on the other hand.... was very not good to me.  The gnocchi tasted funny, and I just did not like the rabbit.  It tasted overly gamey.  This is my first time having rabbit, so it could very be that I just do not like rabbit."}
{"text":"I love the concept here of the small plates and large plates.  Get two or three small plates to share with someone, or be greedy and just order a whole large plate for yourself.  Everything that we've ordered here has been outstanding.  My favorites are the rabbit with dumplings and the poutine.  Also, they have one of my favorite Ceasar salads in the Pittsburgh area...with whole anchovies!

This place even satisfied my snobby father who is used to West coast eating.  There's enough variety on this menu for anyone!"}
{"text":"I attended an organization dinner meeting at the Willow this evening and I cannot say enough about this place!  I wish I could remember our server's name who was excellent!  Some servers tend to treat a large party like ours (20 or so) with little enthusiasm, but this girl actually enjoyed helping us!  Never had an empty glass or dirty plate!  

The meal was the all you can eat BBQ Buffet! EVERYTHING was excellent.  BBQ Chicken, ribs, brisket all had meat fall from the bones!   Even the coleslaw, which was vinegar based, was really good!

Loved the atmosphere!  

Took me less than 30 minutes to get there from the south hills.   Easy to say I will be back in a few weeks with the Bird to try it again and order off their regular menu!"}
{"text":"Having been here in the past, my girlfriend and I had this ranked among our favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere for dinner was always very good, great service, and better food. Unfortunately, none of that is true any more. 

We came for an early dinner where I ordered the pork chop with a salad and my girlfriend had the panzanella salad with crab cakes. My salad was bland with mediocre dressing. My girlfriends salad wasn't even remotely close to what a panzanella salad should be. My pork chop was cold and lacked any good flavor. My girlfriends crab cakes were \"just ok\" at best. 

Even worse than the food was the atmosphere. I assume there were children upstairs that were running back and forth above us the entire meal and causing s disturbingly high amount of noise. The booth's cushion they sat us at looked like someone took a knife too it and pulled away the leather lining. Our waitress was very kind but that didn't make up for the food. 

Overall, the food was so drastically different than I remember previously that I assume the entire kitchen staff has changed. It was mediocre at best and can no longer be compared to the much better and consistent restaurants Pittsburgh has to offer"}
{"text":"First off, I want to add that my review is based on lunch experiences and not dinner.  

I love the atmosphere, and the attentiveness of the staff.  In that regard alone, Willow deserves 5 stars.  What I did not like was my lunch even though it was a highly recommended dish (the crab cake).  For the portion size, what I paid was laughable.  I left starving actually.  I think it would have been better for me to have chosen something else so I know better for the next time.  Make sure you have a hearty breakfast before coming here for lunch and ordering the crab cake lunch.  

I also want to add that the crab cake was nothing spectacular (perhaps I have been spoiled being that my husband is from Baltimore and I have experienced some amazing crab cakes in the past few years).

I will have to try to come back here for dinner sometime, but living in the city and having so many options closer to home makes me wonder if this will happen since my lunch experience was nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! My husband and I started with the Beef Tartar followed by a Caesar salad. The salmon is always my favorite entrée since the chef usually switches it up in preparation. The beef fillet was very tender and paired nicely with a cheesy potato side."}
{"text":"First let me say that I've had many wonderful dinner experiences at Willow, and while my most recent visit was not \"wonderful\", it was at least \"excusable\" given past . . . let's call it \"enjoyment equity.\"

The mistakes, none too damning were:  mixed up drinks, cold coffee, and winelist that reflected wines they were out of. 

And though not a \"mistake\" per se, our waiter. . . let's call him \"Name Withheld\" was new.  If he wasn't new, this whole review should be called, Willow needs to hire better wait staff.  But I'm sure he was new.  He wasn't terribly savvy about the selections, appeared to read them off a slip of paper hidden on his tray (or was chronically fearful of making eye contact), and wasn't terribly informative about some of the items on the menu.

That said, the food was excellent.  I had the special, which was braised lamb ravioli on pureed white beans with carmelized onions and fig and was such a fantastic marriage of flavors and textures that I felt it trumped the previous two paragraphs worth of whining on my part.  

My wife ordered her steak rare. . . and let me tell you, the law would forbid a rarer steak from being served without reclassifying the restaurant a butcher shop. . . which is EXACTLY how she likes it.

If this were my first trip to Willow, I probably wouldn't return.  I enjoyed the food, but there are LOTS of places with food I enjoy, and a so-so visit for these prices is a lot to expect.  But it was NOT my first visit to Willow, and I feel sure they'll recover.  

Still, like any business, the name of the game is \"what have you done for me lately\", and the name of my most recent visit to Willow would be \"Gave me good food with so-so service that cost a lot.\""}
{"text":"Easter dinner did not disappoint.  The filet, and crab cakes are fantastic.  Only wish we had bread served with dinner. Great job ! Service was great as usual."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me with a nice romantic date night dinner here. It was our first time eating at Willow. The restaurant reminds me of a nice,cozy, and welcoming house in the woods. We ordered herbed bread and garlic butter for the starter. Even though it was simple, it was well executed and sensational. We both ordered steak frites. The steak was perfect, the fresh cut fries were nice and crisp, and the bone marrow sauce was delicious. My boyfriend really liked the dressing that was on the salad that accompanied the steak. We both had a fantastic time and will definitely return for another wonderful date night."}
{"text":"What a wonderful hidden gem. 

About 20 minutes outside of the city, Willow is hidden near lush greenery, making it one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of eating at.

Our party was seated promptly and our waiter was very knowledgeable of both the menu and drink list. I ordered a drink that had sweet tea vodka and pink lemonade. It was so strong, not for the weak stomached or low tolerance. But, as a drinker, I loved it. 

We were brought out the most delicious bread, with Parmesan cheese and olive oil. It was amazing. 

For entrees, my brother-in-law had the steak, cooked perfectly. My older sister had the twin fillets. My twin sister had the chicken breast. Lastly, I had the wedge salad and bacon blue cheese potato ravioli.....

Everything was as delicious as it sounds and more. The wedge salad was the standout for our entire party. It had a warm scotch egg and a berry compote that were amazing. I want to learn how to make this, since Pitt is so far away from home!

Service:impeccable 
Cuisine:amazing take on new American.
Ambiance:romantic, upscale, beautiful.

I wish there were more stars to give!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. The inside ambiance is beautiful. My company comes here every Christmas for a department lunch. I had the chicken stuffed with spinach and mushrooms in a creamy sauce. There are two chicken breast with the spinach and mushrooms in the middle. It's very good. It also came with a side of carrots and butter nut squash. I don't think this is on the regular menu but on the catering menu."}
{"text":"The food is typically really good and the prices aren't too bad.  Willow is accommodating to families and has good cocktails and drinks too.  Love their burger (as they are in the brgr group it should be good)."}
{"text":"What says GreekTown more than a Tex-Mex restaurant?  Well, Willow.  And I'll freely admit, I had no idea what to expect the first time I entered the place.  Having just worked at the Bad Dog Theatre (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bad-dog-theatre-toronto), I soon discovered that Willow has become the de facto food place for the folks I was improvising with.  The name of the place certainly did not give away what I was in for, unless \"Willow\" means something in the Lone Star State that I'm not aware of.

The décor is what you'd expect for a It's Tex-Mex with a good run of beer taps, but also provides full bar service for folks (like those in my party) that weren't in the mood for anything Mexican, beer or otherwise.  The menu has typical Tex-Mex fare and provides all the faves you'd expect from an independent Tex-Mex restaurant.  The service is attentive, friendly, and bring the food in good time.  Go in for your quesadillas, burritos, all that.  Admittedly, I've had friends of mine that have had passable meals there, but I guess I've just been lucky.  Nothing I've eaten there has dipped below the \"actually quite tasty\" mark.

Before you find yourself heading east into the belly of the Greek Beast on the Danforth, you may want to take a run south of the border."}
{"text":"My first visit here was for Sunday brunch.  I'll definitely be back!

Shrimp and grits were amazing.  Nice drink selection priced slightly lower than comparable places, but the quality was top notch.  Our server was very knowledgeable.  Great experience."}
{"text":"I agree with Todd V.'s review: despite its ambiguous name, Willow Restaurant serves great Tex-Mex food (think fajitas, burritos, chimichangas, and enchiladas) and the wait staff was attentive. If you happen to be dining with some choosey eaters, there are vegetarian options for most dishes and non-Tex-Mex options (pasta dishes and BLT sandwiches). 

After eating my delicious chimichanga meal served with rice and refried beans, I declared that I would definitely be re-visiting the Willow soon."}
{"text":"My mother and I came here for a nice sit down Sunday brunch, and that's exactly what we got.  We're not huge fans of the buffet style brunches and Willow had a great sit down menu. So, my mom had the spinach/red pepper and goat cheese omelette and I had the Crab cake Benedict.  Both dishes were beautiful when they came to the table, gorgeously plated. My dish was delicious, crab cakes were perfect and the eggs perfectly poached. The hollandaise was good, I get it on the side because i'm not a huge fan (i know i'm odd).  My mom got the omelette and she loved it! She worked in fine dining for over 25 years, this is not an easy woman to please, and Willow did.  The only thing she didn't really enjoy was the sausage patties.  She just didn't like the texture, the taste was alright. 

Our server, Leah, was great.  She went above and beyond to give us a great experience. We will definitely be back for lunch or dinner to give Willow another try. 

My mother had one suggestion. For brunch, open 15 minutes before your first reservation.  Willow opens at 10:30am on Sunday's where most restaurants open at 10am. We thought they were closed at first.  

Would absolutely recommend Brunch!! When we come back for lunch/dinner i'll update!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my mom's 98th birthday Friday evening, July 5.  When we entered the restaurant we were greeted with smiles and seated immediately.  It was our first time at Willow Restaurant and it was a very pleasant surprise.  We had a very leisurely dinner beginning with cocktails and a delightful garlic infused olive oil and Parmesan cheese for dipping herbed focaccia.  We then chose our light dishes aka appetizers.  The wedge with blue cheese, berry compote and a Scotch egg was satisfying and unusual.  Mains were then chosen.  All of the dishes were delicious and beautifully presented.  The BBQ double cut pork chop was properly done and juicy.  The medium rare steak was delicious.  The red snapper was a real treat.  One of our party opted to get the fried green tomatoes with a marvelous sauce and an order of the sweet potato fries with a truffle sauce.  She was thrilled with her selection.   Our server was attentive and helpful and always had a smile and a pleasant answer to our questions.  We were made to feel at home.  We ate lies ugly and no one rushed us and all food was server end when the previous course was cleared.  It was a good and enjoyable evening with good food, time to share stories and good service."}
{"text":"Took friends to Willow first time I was there some they remodeled atmosphere was nice the food was very good the server Fred was very knowledgable and provided good info for the table on the menu"}
{"text":"I ate here this past Saturday night with a dining companion.  Since we were celebrating Valentine's Day, we decided to start off the night in the bar where we each had a cocktail.  The nice thing is that we were there during happy hour and their happy hour is also valid on Saturdays.  The decor of the bar was nice with a good amount of lighting.  After we had finished our cocktails we were led upstairs to our table.  The room was interesting with my dining companion sitting on one side of the table on part of  a long booth with a mild green light above it and myself sitting across from her in a chair.  I thought that the light looked weird and out of place but the ambience from it ended up being quite nice.
 
We decided to start off our meal with the duck tacos for our appetizer.  There were two tacos and they came with a lot of different toppings on them and tasted pretty good.  The best part about them was that the duck was cooked perfectly and was not greasy at all.  For dinner I decided upon having the duck breast while my dining companion got the salmon.  The chef recommended that my duck be cooked to medium rare and I agreed to it.  We also decided to split two sides, the asparagus and the polenta with collard greens.  Whenever my duck came, it was quite a bit chewier than I would have liked which I attributed to the temperature that the duck was cooked to.  The sides that came with my duck were an au jus which gave it good flavor, an interesting concoction of lentils and some very tasty brussel sprouts.  My dining companion complimented her meal as well saying that the salmon was done nicely.  The aparagus was a nice side with the tips having the most lemon butter flavor.  I would normally recommend everyone get that as a side but I think that the collard greens and polenta stole the spotlight.  The polenta was very cheesy and married perfectly with the slight bitterness of the collard greends.  For dessert we decided on the toffee pudding.  It was not what we were expecting and was more of an oatmeal type cake (think brownie without the chocalate) drizzled with a toffee sauce.  It was still very good and both my dining companion and myself were pleased with it.  As a side note, since it was around Valentine's Day we also had the pleasure of seeing the couple two tables over get engaged.  The restaurant was unaware that it was going to happen but happily gave the gleaming couple some flutes of complimentary chapagne to celebrate with.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here in the future.  Everything was good from the drinks to dinner, dessert and even the service was very good as well."}
{"text":"The food was well done...beautiful in presentation and flavor. The drinks were also well made and they offered lots of choices at happy hour prices.

We sat outside on the patio. I had a caipirinha at $7 and a mule at $6. Both were just what you would expect from their style/description. None of the happy hour 'snacks' appealed to me so instead I ordered the $14 mussels in green curry & wild mushroom crostini at $8 off the small plates menu. The mussels were tender and I enjoyed the coconut curry and buttered toast points. The crostini had a blueberry sauce and this threw off the flavor for me...the mushrooms and fava bean were enough. 

The atmosphere was a bit lacking...even though we enjoyed sitting outside on a nice warm evening. There weren't many people there on a Friday...four couples scattered across the patio. On one side of the patio is the parking lot separated by a fence. We were also in the corner of the patio near the entrance of the restaurant so if you're looking for privacy or romantic atmosphere don't sit there.

Overall, it was a decent happy hour and I would return. Someday we may even go for dinner"}
{"text":"We ate at Willow tonight for our Anniversary Dinner. This was our first time at Willow after hearing nothing but positive reviews.

We made a reservation the day before not knowing how busy they would be but upon arrival there was really no reason for a reservation.

The Atmosphere/Decor of this restaurant is really nice, the lighting was perfect also. If anyone remembers Mardi Gras the Willow is leaps and bounds nicer.

We were promptly seated upstairs and the whole Dinner there were only two other tables eating. Most of the other customers were outside. It was nice and quiet and very nice, a great place to take a date or significant other.

As for the service there were no issues. Our server Victoria was really nice and prompt. She explained everything to us and you could tell she was there for a while. (Turned out she has been there from the beginning) She  forgot to get me a Beer refill and was nice enough to offer it for half off without me saying everything. Overall a great experience.

The food. No complaints. The bread was really good. Beef Stew was awesome, Filet was also really good (Marrow was a great touch), Potatoes were okay, nothing special. I passed on the greens, do not care for them. Wife said the salad was good and the main course, Cranberry Chicken was awesome. She also said the Mixed Drink was really good.

The only reason for the three stars was the price. A few drinks and dinner for two came to almost 90$. The experience was really great I'm just not sure it was worth that much. I will probably return in the future but the Willow would not be a regular place, only for special occasions."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL!!!!  Went there for Valentines Day - it was fun and cool!!!  I can't wait to take my friends!!!  Across the board - great experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"I remember visiting this location when it was the Bantam Bar. A favorite of my family for over 20 years, there are almost no traces of the old business owing to an extensive and tasteful remodel. I visited today with my adult daughter who returned for Christmas from Dallas. Willow remains our family's go to spot for nice occasions. I had the Willow Burger with bourbon bacon sauce and grilled onions. Juicy, perfectly done came with fries which were perfectly seasoned. My daughter had the chicken Brie flat bread and raved about it. If you're in the area, go, if not nearby, it's clearly a destination."}
{"text":"We came in for our anniversary. It also was a penguins playoff night. Since we were seated close to the bar, we could see the penguins game, which was fine. Unfortunately when it started, the sound was turned up and our quiet dinner was over, so it seems. We asked Matt ( the manager) if we could be seated away from the bar. Not only did he seat us at a much better spot, we were offered some complementary champagne and desserts.
About our food. My wife had the crab cakes and they were delicious. Lots of lump crabmeat and it tasted really fresh. I had the steak and frites. The steak was done perfect. The frites tasted fantastic. I am a Dutch guy and we know how good frites should taste. These were up there with the best of them. Altogether, the meal was awesome and the price was really good for what we are. Portions were also perfect. I will definitely go back. Highly recommended for a good meal."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my meal. The burger and fries were seasoned to perfection. The willow bar dessert was mouth watering. The prices weren't bad and the staff was friendly and helpful. We will be back"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for brunch this past Sunday because we were looking for something in the North Hills area. We were both very happy that we chose this restaurant. It was a nice summer day so we opted to sit outside in the sun but walking through the dining area inside it looked very nice. It would probably be a great place to come for a family dinner or date night. 

The only problem with this place is there's too many options that all sound amazing. It makes it so hard to choose. I ended up ordering the tacos but I wasn't super impressed. I was picturing actual pieces of pork belly with eggs on top but instead it had very little pork belly tossed in to the eggs. I also had a apricot bellini and a glass of sangria to go with my entree. Both of which were delicious and very refreshing. After this brunch experience I'm really excited to go back and try some of their dinner options."}
{"text":"Ok, sometimes trying a new place for lunch is not such a good thing to do!  Case in point: My partner and I went to Willow this past Sunday...bad idea.  The place is touted as a \"Tex-Mex\" restaurant...but there was nothing Tex-Mex about it.  The place was dead.  The food was nothing more than Ortega pre-made food from the grocery store...and they even managed to ruin that.  Being from Texas and coming from a Mexican-American family I can tell you that this is NOT even close to tex-mex cuisine.  The food was completely inedible...so we paid and left after having only eaten literally two bites of food.  The menu is large and full of Italian and Asian cuisine...which makes one wonder how you can call yourself Tex-Mex in the first place.  For their prices $15+ per person without an alcoholic beverage one should expect to get food that you can actually eat.  After eating my stomach began to hurt some...maybe it was the burnt hambuger meat on the \"taco\" I took a bite from...or maybe it was from the canned beans the served.  To sum this experience up in two words: NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and attentive. The smoked brisket with bbq sauce was tasty! The scallops were amazing! The atmosphere was warm and inviting!
                        SUCCULENT"}
{"text":"Nice lunch outing sitting outside on their patio.

The inside looks quite nice. I'll have to try it some other time.

Had the fish tacos with fries. Both were good. Note that the fries are a portion ample enough for two but I proceeded to eat them all with no problem.  The price was quite decent, about 13.00 for the meal, iced tea, and tax.

An oddity worth mentioning is that there is a hostess station but the hostess was sitting at a hightop. I had to ask if she was the hostess as her demeanor, dress, and the fact she was casually sitting did not make it evident."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a real treat. Crab cakes were wonderful along with appetizers. Love the atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. A little expensive, but worth it to try the food."}
{"text":"I just attended my sister's baby shower at Willow and it was nothing short of perfect!! The venue is beautiful and the lunch buffet option was delicious (pasta primavera, herbed chicken, sautéed veggies, roasted potatoes, fruit platter, Willow salad). There were approximately 30 ladies in attendance and there was plenty of space in the \"Woods Room\" to mingle/ socialize. Our server, Elena (sp*), was amazing, and helped everything to run smoothly. Willow will be my \"go to\" for any future events. They truly have the gift of hospitality!"}
{"text":"This used to be the BEST Tex-Mex place in the city up until about 2005.  It then went through a management change and went through some dark days where portions shrunk and everything seemed dried up.  their best waiter \"Jose\" also quit.

I went once a year on my birthday for the past 3 years, and finally its year it returned to a semi-decent Tex-Mex place.  The actual plates are now square so they're a little fancier and the service isn't nearly as good but Friday Nights still has a Burrito / Enchilada combo platter for 12.95 that is pretty awesome.  The beer was a little warm for my liking no matter what type of pitcher we got so you might want to stick to bottles of Dos Equis.."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday brunch this morning. The space is updated and beautiful. The menu I features many delicious items. I went with the crab eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had the chicken and biscuits. Both were made well with quality ingredients. The potatoes were not crispy or tasty which was disappointing. Service was incredibly slow for a half empty dining room. Would like to return for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner out on the patio which has an overhang which was great becaus we had a drizzle during dinner. The crab cakes were the best ive had since maryland! Mostly crab with just the right amount of other stuff.our waitress victoria (i think) handled my familys special orders and questions with great knowledge and style . She had the right mixture of  personal interaction and knowledgeable well timed service  that made the whole experience perfect. All the food was delicious . The steaks were perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful. Perfect! Thanks for a lovely evening!"}
{"text":"Drinks were unique and delicious.  Portions were pretty generous given the price points on the menu. There's certainly enough menu items to please most palates.

I was a bit confused by the presentation of the Chicken and Brie sandwich after reading the description. I thought there would be more of a contrast or separation of the ingredients, rather than everything feeling all smushed together on a sandwich. To me the sandwich tasted like creamed spinach with mushroom and chicken (leg and thigh) on sour dough bread. In my mind I thought there would be large chunks of chicken, with a layer of cooked mushroom, topped with brie and spinach, followed by basil mayo on the sour dough. I would have almost liked everything separate: chicken and mushroom, with a creamed brie and spinach side, served with thick slices of sour dough.

The basil mayo was totally lost in everything, which is kind of sad because basil mayo is a pretty amazing condiment. The sourdough bread was the clear winner in this portion of the meal."}
{"text":"The pork cutlet is quite delicious and rather large so be prepared to take some home. The squash and potatoes are really a nice side for the dish and I enjoyed mine with a Pino Grigio. Great selection of beers and wine with a lovely ambience. Upstairs they have great seating for large parties and downstairs is a really beautiful bar. The place has a dark, classy and rustic feel to it and I think the name Willow fits it perfectly. The Apple pie with ala mode was also wonderful. Also a nice place to get out of the city and head North."}
{"text":"This review is based off three visits.  Atmosphere, service, and food all good.  The reason I give it three stars is one thing I had was pathetic.

Visit 1 - Crab Cake dinner...4 Stars...some of the best in area.

Visit 2 - Hamburger...4 stars...IMO.  Burger is great.

Visit 3 - French Dip...1 star...where's the beef?  Was more like a French onion soup sandwich.  Only a couple slices of meat and a bunch of caramelized onions and cheese.  Very disappointed...figured they had a great burger so they'd have to have a great French dip...NEGATIVE!

We'll go back because they have so many good dishes."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner at Willow.  We had a large party but service was still very smooth and accommodating.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of our server but she was sweet and really did what she could to keep our group satisfied.

The Good:

-Great local wine selection, great Malbec on the menu.
-Food was, overall, well done.
-I had the Short Rib dish which was delicious, though slightly oversalted. My husband had the sirloin which was perfect with the egg on top and the additional horseradish that he requested.

The Bad:

-The crab cakes.  I don't understand why everyone raves about these.  They tasted like they were made from Pollock, dry, and cold in the center.  They are obviously frozen.  

-Too dark...really couldn't even distinguish items on the plates.

-They had a \"sashimi special\" which included a white fish, soaked in lime juice, hidden under kiwi (????).  It is surrounded by soy \"gels\".  It was too much.  In an attempt to go Avant Garde, this dish instead came off pretentious.  It was much more the likes of a ceviche, so let's call it what it is.

I guess I would expect better from a restaurant where the average dinner dish costs  $27 (which may or may not include sides)."}
{"text":"New chef, new menu ! Run don't walk for a top dining experience conveniently located in the suburbs. Chef worked at Michelin starred restaurant and it shows. Interesting flavorful dishes prepared with care by a trained hand. 
We had Gazpacho and hamachi to start, crab cakes and halibut for main dishes. All were packed with flavor and cooked to perfection.
Don't miss the lemon custard dessert, we wanted to lick the plate!
Service was friendly and attentive as well as knowledgeable. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Well I haven't been to Willow for a dinner/happy hour since they closed their doors a few years back and \"rebranded.\"  I wasn't sure what to expect, but after having a delicious Valentine's Day brunch a few weeks ago I was hopeful.  And I have to say we had a great time.  It was not crowded...which makes me happy and nervous all at the same time, so we easily found seats at the bar.  The menu offered quite a variety, and we decided to keep it light and share a few small plates.  The poached shrimp flatbread was delicious.  Great portion for sharing, generous toppings and full of flavor.  There is nothing worse in my opinion than ordering a flatbread and the highlight flavor is actually just the bread.  And ps - pickled coriander might be my new favorite thing.  The bartender Andrew was very nice, and offered his recommendation of the beef tartare when we indecisive about which direction to go next.  He was right...it was AMAZING.  I could have eaten an entire meal just of the tartare.  My friend had never tried it before, and was a little nervous...and now is a tartare lover as well.  I definitely recommend this spot for an after work happy hour...and if Andrew is working...he won't steer you wrong!  I am looking forward to going back and trying more menu items soon.

The only negative critique is that the space is freezing.  On Valentine's Day for brunch it was the same way.  I'm not sure if they keep it cold in anticipation of larger crowds, but with a room in the back that has a garage door as a wall (and will be amazing in the spring/summer) and a large front door constantly opening/closing, it was noticeably cold, and when it's not crowded, you will feel it.  So plan ahead and bring a sweater...and hope for warm weather soon!"}
{"text":"I have been driving past this place for a couple years and always wanted to go in. This past weekend, we finally decided to have dinner at Willow and we are glad that we did. The layout consists of a couple small/medium sized dining rooms instead of one large room. We were seated in an upstairs dining room but there is a room with a fireplace on the main floor that we will try on our next visit. 
The food was just as good as the decor. We started with a house side salad that had a good variety of greens with peppers, feta and enough dressing to cover everything. For dinner, we had a steak with shrimp/lobster kabob and crab cakes. The steak was good and perfectly cooked. The shrimp, lobster and vegetables had just enough char to taste good but there was a tab bit too much black pepper for my taste. I would have preferred a little Italian seasoning or red pepper. The crab cakes were loaded with lump crab meat with little or no bread crumbs and just the enough vegetables to make the crab cakes taste wonderful. We finished with some nice warm cake and a willow coffee. I can't remember the name of the cake, but it sounded great when the waiter was describing it to us. I also really liked that they had some adult coffee drinks. I wish more restaurants would have warm alcoholic drinks during the winter. I also liked that each course was properly spaced. At no time did we have two courses on the table at the same time. It was so refreshing to have dinner and not feel rushed. It didn't feel like it, but dinner took more than 2 hours. I'm sure it has something to do with the company, but the server never made us feel rushed.
I am glad that we finally tried this place and will definitely be visiting them again."}
{"text":"We went to Willow tonight for the first time. We were kinda beat after an afternoon of \"The Home & Garden Show\" and shopping at Ross Park Mall and decided this would be a good choice for an early Sunday evening dinner. 

The restaurant is beautiful, nice ambiance, colored lighting, interesting floor lamps, slate accent wall. It's a great spot for a big group or an intimate romantic dinner. Our server greeted us right away and was very friendly and helpful with dinner suggestions. I got a Willow-tini, Bacardi Coco, and Limon Rums, Blue Curacao, sours, pineapple and white cranberry juice. It was really good and a pretty blue color. BJ got a brown ale. House ciabatta bread was served hot with parmesan and olive oil. Yum. We decided to share the \"Shrimp Tots\" just because it sounded so odd we wanted to try it. It's a blend of shrimp & shaved potatoes, fried, and served with a roasted garlic lemon-chive aioli. The appetizer was surprising light, we thought it was fun. BJ also got a \"Willow\" Green salad that included roasted red peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and crumbled feta in a house dressing. Very good. 

For dinner, I chose the highly recommended crab cakes. They were broiled and drizzled with a tangy red onion caper sauce and served with al dente baby carrots with chopped pecans. They were pretty much all jumbo lump crab, very little filler. I loved them! BJ had the Ginger-Sesame Pork Tenderloins. Our server said that the chef recommends that they are cooked medium rare, so Jim followed that suggestion. He mentioned that he thought they looked a little too pink. I sampled the pork medallions and thought they were delicious. I also loved the lemon-soy butter that they were served in as well as the coconut scallion rice side dish. It was all very, very good. Yes, BJ is nice, he allows his girlfriend to stick her fork in his food! 

For dessert, we shared a huge hunk of carrot cake. Jim had organic Mexican coffee, I had Willow Coffee which was Baileys Irish Cream, Frangelico, Dark Creme de Cacao, topped with whipped cream. Very yummy. 

Our server was good and I was also impressed by the host staff. After wandering around looking for the ladies room, the hostess was thoughtful enough to lead me downstairs to show me exactly where to go. Funny and nice. 

We had a very good experience here and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"After attending a yoga class right down the road at animal friends my friends and I decided to have brunch at willow which was close by.

We made reservations through open table promptly greeted by a hostess as soon as we got there and seated. They had a great selection of breakfast cocktails including basics such as a Bloody Mary and mmmosa.

The menu consisted of appetizers, small plates, and large plates. The decision was so difficult, luckily we all ordered different things so we could share. I had the duck confeit tacos which were awesome. I also tried the crab cake eggs Benedict  which was made with the most amazing crab cake. 

Breakfast dessert? Ok why not, we ended up sharing the willow bar and Panama cotta, both delectable.

We will definitely be back for more! Also, after being seated inside we learned of an outdoor patio which we asked if we could move to and they were more than accommodating."}
{"text":"Super hip and intimate setting at Willow. The food is very good, but it is overpriced. Great location for a date or special occasion though!"}
{"text":"We figured we'd try this place on Friday night - last minute decision based on favorable reviews. We were very pleased we did. Hostess was friendly and was able to seat us the moment we arrived, around 5:15. Our waiter greeted us very shortly after and he was friendly as well. I ordered small plates (braised beef tacos) which were very good. I also had the pierogi poutine - very good as well. My wife had the mussels with toasted wedges. I was disappointed to an extent that I didn't order the same because they were phenomenal and I'm not a big mussels fan. She enjoyed both of her cocktails which is saying a lot because she is particular about cocktails. I had a Sam Adams summer ale - good, fresh nice and cold. The only negative I can think of was when we were being seated, I noticed waitstaff eating and drinking sodas at a bar inside. This is a bit unprofessional but not the end of the world. Great place, really good food and cocktails. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were on business and being take their by the locals.....they keep talking about this burger.....best burger ever.  Right.  Well, it was darn close.  The waitress was very nice, very attentive, they had bottomless Arnold Palmers, and the side was some type of asian stir fried vegetables.  Excellent.  I had the Bacon Wiskey Jam and grilled onions, with the blue cheese (type) on the burger.  Really well seasoned.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Me and the hubby hadn't been to Willow in forever. We made the decision to go and I made reservations through Open Table. We looked at the menu prior to going and realized the menu had changed considerably since our last visit. Gone the cranberry chicken, here a new and exciting change. We got there and we were immediately seated. Given the menu changes we were interested to see if anything else had changed. The waiters and waitresses no longer \"dressy\" but now casual in jeans and t-shirts. I always liked the atmosphere: soft lighting, inviting fireplace, warm woods. That all stays the same.
We were greeted almost immediately by our awesome waiter, Fred. He was attentive, friendly, and very knowledgeable the entire time we were there. Apparently it'd been longer than we thought since we had been there as, according to Fred, they changed things in the summer of 2014. Gone the never changing menu. Here a new and changing menu with different foods...very nice. Fred gave us a run down of the menu and gave us time to make a decision. There are bar apps, small plates, and entrees. Everything sounded so awesomely appetizing and it was difficult to make a decision but we did :). We decided on a small plate as an appetizer. The hubby wanted to try their beef soup as well. And we chose entrees. 
We started with drinks. The hubby went with a seasonal beer. I chose a signature cocktail. I got the Old Cuban, very good with lots of alcohol. It is a mix of rum, champagne, bitters, mint, and lemon juice. It was very refreshing, light. We got the lettuce wraps to start. Very good! Beef in lettuce. The beef cooked to perfection-it was juicy and tender and drizzled lightly with a spicy aoloi complemented by, what I'd describe as a sweet balsamic on the side. It was a nice mix of sweet and spicy. It was a wonderful explosion of flavor. The hubby got the beef soup presented in a neat way, the beef and noodles in a bowl, Fred pouring the broth over the beef and noodles table side. It was a nice touch and it smelled Heavenly. The soup was terrific, miso-esque. The hubby enjoyed it. For my entree, the Eichner's Farm chicken. The chicken was fresh and succulent, so juicy and tender. It was served on a sweet potato mash with Brussel sprouts mixed with bacon and red onion. The red onion not at all overpowering to the Brussel sprouts. The hubby chose the pork chop served with fennel and apple kraut and spatzle. The chop was a little overdone just around the edge but perfection in the middle. It was juicy and terrific. The spatzle, wow! The hubby noted it was the best he has ever had. He loved the kraut as well and he has never been a kraut fan. For dessert, the willow bar, a chilled chocolate masterpiece. I'd liken it to a chilled chocolate cake with fudginess and a pretzel crust, divine! Overall the changes since our last visit-definitely a positive. The vibe is chill. The food was superb. Drinks were delightful. The wait staff a class act. Atmosphere was warm and inviting. If you are in the North Hills and looking for a nice restaurant to try or looking to celebrate a special occasion and don't want to drive into downtown and have to pay for parking, go to Willow. It was a fabulous dining experience!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now, as it's one of the only restaurants near my house, and I'd had good experiences having a drink at their lovely bar before. So when my aunt and uncle came to town, I decided to give it a shot. I made a reservation for us on Monday night - which turned out to be completely unnecessary, the place was almost empty. We had some yummy cocktails while we looked over the menu and chatted. Service was knowledgeable, if not necessarily overly friendly or attentive. Food was very good, especially the Brussels sprouts...I'm a sucker for some Brussels sprouts! Uncle had the burger, with bacon whiskey jam...BACON WHISKEY JAM!!! He really enjoyed it, and you'd better believe that's going in my mouth on a subsequent visit. Aunt was told that she'd need 3 of the small plates to make a meal and was full on 1 and a half. But to be fair to the waiter, she is tiny. She loved the cornmeal gnocchi, fish tacos were just OK...which the waiter had basically told her. I had the steak frites. Steak was cooked perfectly. The creamed spinach that came with it was disappointing though. All in all, a good night and I will definitely go back. I wavered between 3 & 4 stars and opted for 4 based on the fact that it's a nice place with a lot of options and it's basically in my back yard."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, perfect place to be together with friends. Lobster roll was okay not the best I've had. We also had catfish taco which had good flavor but you only get two with side salad. Overall okay meal."}
{"text":"The menu is extremely limited. There is nothing to eat if you are vegetarian. The food is ok. Service is fine. Atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! It is by far one of my favorite restaurants. Not only is the food incredible, but the staff is very friendly and attentive. Whether your going to Willow for a special occasion or just a nice evening out this place will never let you down. Victoria was our waitress and she was great!!"}
{"text":"BLT flatbread was tasty, but cocktails and other appetizers were mediocre. Server seemed to be stretched thin. The main course meals looked tasty, but we didn't have any of those."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews here that mention the odd pricing structure. Things like burgers are reasonably priced but things that feature pasta are more expensive and have smaller portions. Brought my mother here for her birthday and she really enjoyed it, so I'll consider that a win. The food was good and the service was attentive. Overall, this place gets filed under \"special occasions\" for future visits."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner here the other day and was pleasantly surprised.   The restaurant is in what looks like an old house or some kind of very large ski chalet.  Inside there was a bar that was a little narrow but long.  I would imagine during busy times it could get quite crowded. There were several rooms in multiple directions as well as an upstairs dining area. We got there early so there weren't many people anywhere but it seemed like it could be a very warm and pleasant place on a cold day with fireplaces in every room as well.

Started out with the beet salad which was good but not my favorite--I felt it was lacking in beets if that makes any sense. I think it they just put a lot of other things in it that covered the beet taste.  We then decided to split several small plates. Their most famous for their crabcakes so we started with that. The crabcakes did not have any filler in them whatsoever, except maybe a little bit of breadcrumbs to hold it together. They were excellent and the crab tasted very good. We then moved on to a brisket taco which was also excellent. I scarfed mine down in record time I think.  

The waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly and attentive. I think this would be a great place to bring friends or family. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Willow because we had a gift card but would definitely not be returning again (especially with our own money involved!). With the high prices and luxurious vibe, we expected a delicious and quality meal. However, we were severed disappointed and underwhelmed. To start we ordered the chicken and brie flatbread as an appetizer and within minutes it was delivered to our table. The flatbread was cold and lacked flavor. I ordered the pork chop for dinner, which was extremely overcooked and very very tough. Why would the waiter specifically ask my preference for meat tenderness if the kitchen will cook it over done?! Downtown Pittsburgh is close in proximity and offers dining experiences at comparable prices but significantly higher quality. Don't waste your money or time at Willow!"}
{"text":"Try to imagine a meal where the server literally does not give a single f --- Tonight, we were waited on by Zach Galifianakis' doppelgänger. It was not good. I will give points for a tasty appetizer of smoked salmon with quail egg and the chicken and mushroom pasta entree was okay. The lobster bisque was actually gross. But not as gross as the service. Never going back. Oh, and the $12 wine pour was less than two fingers, which I believe is only okay if we are talking about tequila."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant . There aren't a lot of options like this in the North hills area . The dishes here are unique and delicious . The staff is very friendly and gives great service . I have never been disappointed in any meal I have had there ! Especially love the outside dining area"}
{"text":"This place has had many incarnations, but this one is most likely the most upscale and the locals seem to dig it.  I remember coming here when it was mardi gras' for all you can eat prime rib, but alas twas years ago.  I was here on Tuesday with Annie after discovering there was a 45 minute wait at monterey pub in n. side due to wing night.  Thus I would be denied one of my fav' burgers in the burgh' nay in the world.  So, we get here kind of late (relatively) and the place is pretty empty.  The space itself is very nice and there is a vibe/room for every type I noticed an outside dining area for al fresca' , a big room with comfy chairs and a fireplace, large bars on mulitple levels, high tops, and booths.  It appears by the decor' and perhaps by the menu this little piece of heaven tries to appeal to every mood or perhaps every palate, eager to not offend and trying to appeal to the masses.  I think it succeeds in this endeavor.  I usually prefer to sit at the bar, but we happen to find ourselves at a table in the back dining room by the patio.  The room is relatively empty and we are greeted quickly by a nice enough young kid (high school i'm guessing) who takes our drink order.  I order the guinness which thankfully they do have and me lady sticks to a diet coke.  I order the Thai Beef lettuce wraps, which are quite delicious I must admit.  It's slow braised skirt steak I (I think) well seasoned cooked perfectly medium served with some type of pickled cucumber.  I'm actually a bit surprised by the complexity of the glaze and the caliber of the dish in general.  I then order the \"willow shellfish trio\" which is more in line with my expectations.  It's two small \"jumbo\" lump crabcakes, glazed scallops and marinated tiger shrimp.  The crabcakes are quite good, delicate but flavorful, almost no filler.  Think Andora or Monterey Bay Fish Grotto, but not quite as good.  The scallops for the most part are not overcooked and the mirin glazed adds some complexity to this subtle sweet shellfish.  The shrimp is a miss, overcooked and clumbsy with the breading.  Annie gets the crispy cranberry chicken of which I only have a bite, but it seems not to be dry and the breading is sweet and for the most part enjoyable.  Brian, our server did a good job from start to finish and even filled us in on a couple of the secrets of the china millman visit.  All in all a perfectly acceptable experience, not quite fine dining, but good service... nice atmosphere and a little above average food."}
{"text":"We are great fans of this restaurant and have spend many dollars on many Friday Happy Hours.
I love this place because it is close top home. But upscale and trendy.
I love there new foods but should just offer new foods as specials. 
I have never seen a restaurant change menu items as often as the Willow.
Most of the things we like and came back for a long gone ( SPICY SHRIMP,Pumpkin Ravioli,Lamb shank Oso-buko , Willow burger with Avocado and not extra braised meat. Wedge Salasd is gone as well as the Caesar salad.....was good stuff ! ) I would also add a french onion or 5 onion soup as a standard menu selection.
They also too k away the great happy hour beer prices , limiting  various taps to full price and only Terrapin Rye Pale Ale for 1/2  is what I drink.

MATT AND ANDREW NEED TO TEAM UP AGAIN!
 
UPDATE ******04/25/2012 I am thinking the bar tenders need to go . They are less than I would expect at I higher end establishment. No pride and zero personality !
Aside from Jesse who is nice and a keeper ! The food quality is still great but with limited choices on the menu. I know places like this have a small entree listing but come on....add some of your old items and popular dishes. This is the reason we have stopped showing for happy Hours Fridays. Caesar Salad was great that need re-added, the olde wedge salad was the bomb. 

Rob."}
