{"text":"Not delicious. I wanted it to be but it wasn't. Firecracker shrimp didn't have good flavor. Looked like some college guy's sad first attempt at stir fry. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice, the first time as sit-down, then as a take-out.  The sit-down experience was good, and the food was good, but the take-out experience was poor.  Let me explain.  So I enter the restaurant and say I want take-out.  I'm handed a bowl and sent on my way, but I realize, when do I pay for this?  I go back, and the person, who I think is also a server, says I can pay for it here. O.K. I hand him the money, but there is no cash register, so he gets my change out of someone's tip, and it looks like he is baffled as to where to put my money. In any case I notice it costs a dollar extra for take-out. Maybe card board boxes are expensive.  Or maybe its a pseudo-tip for the server, because with take-out he wouldn't have gotten a tip else-wise.     In any case, VERY strange. I've never paid higher takeout prices before.    So I fill my bowl and wait for my to-go order.  I can sit at the bar on the other side of the restaurant, but feel strange doing that since I don't want a drink.  So I wait around for my order holding up my number card to they can see if its me.    Hopefully they are this disorganized because it just opened a few weeks ago, but I would never go back for a take-out meal.  And by the way, the box I paid an extra $1 for isn't a great thing to eat a lunch out of.  Otherwise the food seems fine. Lots of choices.  Not much different than other Mongolian places I've been at.  Maybe a bit nicer to dine-in, but much worse for take-out."}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan. Food was dependent on you to come up with the recipe and with the type of food that can not end well. No creativity since the chef does it your way. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Genghis is a standard Mongolian grill restaurant but they have a good selection - meats, fish, veggies, spices, sauces, and I like the different starch choices (rice, tortillas, noodles, etc).  Great place for a quick, healthy lunch that tastes good (and is made to your liking)!"}
{"text":"We tried Genghis Grill with family over the Thanksgiving holiday - Black Friday lunch to be exact.  The place was not busy which was nice so we got excellent service, a good bit of instruction on how to proceed, and time to look at the cards and check out the buffet line.  We ordered the single time bowls which was more than enough.  I thought it was interesting that there was a price difference between lunch and dinner.  We asked our server if their was a larger bowl for dinner and he said \"no.\"  So the price difference is only for the time of day...i.e. lunch is the better deal.  We each picked cards and enjoyed our meals until my daughter started feeling ill.  Genghis Grill's menu say they don't use MSG, but perhaps they are a place that uses the alternate verbiage? (yeast extract...) Or perhaps they just use a ton of oil.  Either way, we won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Meal was pricey, but that's because we got the large bowls. I recommend the medium size as the large is a lot of food. Service was great as well. The staff recommended the right combination of sauce with the meat I chose and it was amazing.   Overall a pleasant experience for us and I will be returning."}
{"text":"AWESOME for what you would think of as \"airport food.\" I love the concept of the fresh veggies on the wok and cooked right in front of you. I got the beef and broc with fried rice. It was excellent and a good price ($9)"}
{"text":"Over priced for how much food you get. 15 dollars. Seriously? Food isn't to bad but I think your better off going to Pei Wei. It's cheaper and you get more food. I will say that everyone that works there was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Read over the negitive reviews and I don't get it. I have lived all over this country and eaten at many Mongolian grills and the Genghis in Henderson is great. Complaining about the size bowls??? What, they are the size and everywhere else that I have eaten. Part of the skill at a grill is to know how to stack yoour veg and protein. I have never been there when the food was anything other than fresh. The comment about sauce not being cooked with the food? I don't get that either. Same with pricing. It is not over priced. I am just stunned by the reviews. Not at all with our experiences there."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! I love the concept of make your own. There are so many choices here. The reason for the 4 star is sometimes the veggies aren't fresh. The zucchini can be mushy and the shrooms a little dark, for example.  But overall, the quality of food is good."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places to come eat lunch/dinner!!!! I can honestly say I've never been disappointed here! Nor have I ever had bad service. Multiple times have gotten a server named Jesse and he's the best. Love love love"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location and the two different locations in Reno many, many, times over the last few years.  I have recommended Genghis to many of my friends as well.   I used to love the food.  Over the years they have made several changes which I have disliked.  They no longer have shrimp.  They used to have steak....they changed it to steak tips.  They have raised the price, and changed it to different sizes.   Through all of that I continued coming.     I just finished my final experience here.   I have had some minor issues with the service before,  but, generally everyone has been friendly.   Tonight, despite their friendliness, I stormed out.  After you finish your first bowl your server comes over and asks if you want the ayce option.  If I am hungry I would prefer not to sit there and wait 15 minutes while my waitress is having a conversation at another table.  Especially while many other employees pass me by.   Funny thing is after about 10 minutes someone came by and said let me get that bowl out of your way( my original bowl)....but took off before I could even ask about another bowl.    I sat there and sat there and finally flagged down an employee and told her I was leaving what I thought would be enough for my food, beverage, and tax.  ($15).  I might have overreacted and could have been more patient,  but there were like 4 tables going in the whole place.   Sick thing is I work in the service industry, and I don't even mind that my waitress was having a conversation.....just hold up on it for a quick second to come over and approve my second bowl....then go right on back.   I was very surprised to see so many poor reviews piling up for this place, but I guess I understand why now."}
{"text":"The food is always good, its just the service that sucks. Our waiter checked on us maybe once and then forgot to put in our order through their fast pay on the tablet at the table. Plus there's the $4 charge to go back in line in case you forgot to put something in your bowl. I've been here several times and never had that enforced on me. Just crappy service."}
{"text":"Good restaurant gone bad! We used to go there twice a week. Now we go twice a year.... Maybe.   They used to have shrimp. Now they don't. Ok I can live without it. The extra bowl was $3 now it's $4. They used to keep great care to make sure that all the containers were full. Now it seems they don't care. Then they went to serve yourself drinks. And sauces. And napkins. So....   What is the appropriate tip to the server? You make your own bowl. Get your own drink. Your own refill. Your own Sriracha. Extra napkins. As far as I can see, the only thing the waitstaff does is bring your bowl. Hey,  call my number and I'll walk the 15 feet and get it faster. Even if I'm in the mood I won't go cause I hate not tipping much. However, we eat out many times per week and it's not fair to Tip them even 10% for doing nothing.   Very sad. We really liked it. It turned into a marginal cafeteria."}
{"text":"The food is alright... It seems like the food stations were unkept... They needed to add more items to the bowls"}
{"text":"It was okay...that's really all there is to say about it. The real trick is piling your plate well, otherwise you're paying $9 (or so) for almost nothing that just tastes alright. Although I'll admit the white fish was decent. I might be a snob when it comes to food, especially the supposedly \"Asian\" kind...but there you are. Realistically, I just don't think I'll return which is why I have to give it a lower rating.   They also seem to be overly staffed. Teens hovering over me everywhere while I'm eating. I know that they just opened, so perhaps they will improve. And on the off chance that I decide to try it again, I can maybe give it a higher rating."}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to try this restaurant out last night.   My wife and I had attempted to eat there about a month ago, but we were short of time, and the line was long.  We got there about 5:30, and there were a few tables filled.   The server was very helpful in showing us the process and the recipe cards to try.  Basically, you are given a bowl as you sit down.  You take the bowl, add in the proteins (meat, chicken, seafood), add from a decent selection of veggies, add spice, and several other items, including a sauce from a good selection.  You then choose if you want rice or noodle, and hand it off to the cooks, who use a circular grill to cook your food.  You can stay and watch the show, or go back to your seat to have the food delivered to you.  Being the first time there, my wife, younger son, and I use the recipe cards.  There are about 14 dishes that you can put together, using the ingredients, which are all numbered.  Just follow the numbers, and add the items, and you have your meal.  My oldest just went off and tried his own.  I tend to like my food spicy, but not to the point where you have to use a fire hose to quell down the heat.  My dish was spicy, but incredibly flavorful.  The price was right for the 4 of us, and the food was delicious!  By the time we left, there was a wait for a table, and this was on a Monday Night!  This is a keeper for our family!"}
{"text":"Wow, get your shit together.1 hour for an iced tea and a lunch bowl? Seriously!! Thanks for wasting my lunch hour!"}
{"text":"I love this Genghis Grill although I am bummed that they have not had shrimp and they didnt have the wasabi sauce  my last two visits. Will be back again hopefull they will have the wasabi sauce and shirimp."}
{"text":"Today,  Mia was our server and hostess.   The service here it's always so excellent.   Food is cooked fresh.   Choices are awesome. We love coming here for the friendly staff and freshest food cooked as you have selected it.   Best way to stay on track of a healthy diet!"}
{"text":"Technically 4.5   I'm gonna go ahead and agree with most people on here that this place has YC's beat hands down in the food department.  Better quality, better choices and the fact that they put the sauce on after the fact all contribute. (Plus really good brown rice)  Also, no stupid take-out charge or whatever.  I've noticed that if you sit in the bar area, the service is incredibly awesome, but if you're in the regular dining area, it's a little lax.  I've only once not sat in the bar area so it's never been a problem, but worth mentioning. (if you're a party of 3 or more, most likely you'll have to sit in the regular dining area FYI)  The kicker is the amazing drink specials.  Last time is was there, it was $1 Wells, $2 3 Olive Vodka drinks, $3 Drafts and $4 Sake Bombs.  The cocktails are mixed good and strong and the sake bombs use pretty good sake and your choice of Kirin or Sapporo.  They obviously don't market these deals very efficiently because this place would always be packed with ASU'ers looking for a cheap buzz every day of the week.  Overall, I really like this place.  Two things they can change/improve on for me to give a perfect rating. 1. They don't seem to clean up the buffet fast enough, which means that sometimes you'll find some pepperoni in the beef, or carrot in the broccoli, or worse yet, some cilantro in the jalapenos (I HATE cilantro!) Plus the sauce area is always sticky. 2. I think that the price of the food should be $1-2 cheaper.  Yes the drink specials even it out and then some, but if you're not taking advantage of those, it's a little pricey, especially since location-wise, they're catering to a lot of college students."}
{"text":"First time in. Aaron the bartender needs a stage. Made a proper Old Fashioned for me. Food was great. 5 star would be achieved if the place was properly staffed. The GM stood there doing nothing while the 3 people attending the floor had wall to wall customers. No hostess? No busser? I'll be back to see Aaron but he said he's rarely on the schedule. Maybe I'll offer him a job in a real bar. Politics and labor Nazis will kill this place."}
{"text":"The night time bartender tonight was amazing! He was so helpful and knowledgable. The food was great and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was amazing. The food was so good, the staff was very friendly. This time, once we got our bowls back from the wok, everything from the protein to the vegetables and the noodles were a dark brown to black shade. Everything tasted like pure char. They very obviously have not been cleaning the grill. On top of that, most of the protein I had loaded my bowl with seemed to had somehow vanished & I was finding random toppings in my bowl (i.e. onions, chicken) that I hadn't personally added. Not thrilled to have spent $24 on two bowls which ended up being charred to the point where they weren't even edible."}
{"text":"Was skeptical coming here the first time, but it was great! I came back twice in the week! You get to make your own portion & the price is great. Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"I love hanging out at this place. Food & drinks are great. But what truly makes this place great is the service & people! Jess & Mike are super awesome and funny at the bar!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Choose your own meats, veggies and sauces.  Then have it grilled with noodles, rice or other type of starch. If you don't like it....you can only blame yourself. 3 sizes of bowls with a bottomless option. You won't walk out hungry!"}
{"text":"New owners and it shows. The decor is completely renovated and they have taken out a view obstructing wall, which has really opened the placed up. I hadn't been at this location for several months but recently stopped in with some coworkers for lunch and was blown away by the design changes. The atmosphere is much more lively and inviting. The service was great and the quality of food, as always, was great. I really like what they did with the bar area as this is where they removed a wall that really obstucted your view of the restuarant when sitting at the bar. Now, it's completely open and is a welcomed change. Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with GG. The power of making what you want is literally in your own hands. This place gives you the ability to select your own ingredients (meats, veggies) and spices  (garlic, cayenne, salt, pepper, etc.). I have found this to be a much better Mongolian Stir-Fry compared to others out there....much, much better. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff is friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times they took the egg from my tray and put it in the other bowl at our table even though the bowls were on separate trays. When you have food allergies, this is a problem. Liked the food, just not confident they can take care of food allergies well."}
{"text":"Great food and great value. If create your bowl right, you can end up with 3 meals. I go without rice and end up filling their serving bowl. Love how you control spice."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love the food selection and draft selection. When I come when it is empty or busy I get the same great service.   I bring my friends here and recommend everyone give it a try. The best part is you can't mess up your meal because you make it, if you don't have a clue what youre doing you can just grab a card off the wall and go."}
{"text":"Tasty new way to enjoy stirfry  You know the feeling you get when you crave asian food, but don't want to order chinese takeout or get sushi? Well, Genghis grill is a perfect fix for any asian food cravings. You get any choice of meat, spices, veggies and sauce you could think of, and its all prepared fresh for you personally on a giant cast iron grill. If you are vegetarian you have the option to mix tofu and veggies and have it cooked on a separate grill in the kitchen to avoid cross contamination with other meats. The same works for any food allergies. My only complaint is I wish that they had someone to portion out the uncooked meat at the beginning of the bar leading up to the grill. I was a little worried about possibly getting raw meat on my hands from the tongs."}
{"text":"This is the first time ive ever had a complaint about the food here. It came back super burnt. I pointed it out to my server and all she did was offer to have them pick out the burnt food. No harm no foul. Im sure it will never happen again.  That being said the staff and atmosphere were amazing as always. Their bartender Mike was as attentive as always. I must say one thing they've done right is having Mike there."}
{"text":"Good amount of ingredients, long wait, and small amount of food. This place is o-k, for 9$ I could get full anywhere else. But the tablet ordering device was really cool, and so was my server. Try it out !"}
{"text":"this place kicks mongolian ass. amazing drink specials ALL day, including 1 dollar mimosas. i felt so bad for the poor bartender though, because he only gets the little bottles of champagne, and had to open like 200 of them in 1 day.   also, the food is good. they have tons of ingredients that most mongolian bbq's don't have, like eggs, and curry, and steak, and scallops and potatoes.  they don't have a huge noodle selection though, unfortunately. still, this place is a billion times better than yc.   booze + mongolian = awesome.  i still think it's kind of hilarious that they named a restaurant after one of the most evil people in the history of humanity. where's adolf's pub?  and you can watch jeopardy while you're eating."}
{"text":"Does anyone at this location enjoy working there?!  BAD customer service! Started - From the bland hostess reception and snotty attitude for us asking for a booth type table and just throwing our napkins and forks on the table. Waiter took several minutes to come our table since he was visiting his friends at another table. We ordered Edamames and never got them. They brought out our food and we asked where the Edamames were and he said...oh...they did not have room to cook them...wtf?    When making our bowls, we asked the staff behind the glass area, about some nutritional information of the sauces...they were clueless and had NO idea how to answer other than NO. I just started here!  They need to be trained better!  We finally asked in the grill area and he showed us a nutritional chart and helped us.   Waiter finally brought us our check, after requesting for him to come back and he had to go find his Manager to use the Birthday Coupon we had.  You should not have to find a Manager in that small of a place!  The Manager must not have control of the restaurants or his staff!  The job seems pretty basic...something is off there!!  Oh...the food was good...but service sucks!"}
{"text":"Genghis Grill is a unique restaurant! It's a Mongolian style BBQ - meaning you get a table - then get in line to create your bowl! You are in control!! You choose the amount of meat, spice, veggies and sauce! There are bazillion different kind of combinations.   The staff is very friendly and attentive -Faye and Bridgette make sure I have my beverage and bowl immediately :)!  A regular bowl is perfect size and you easily have a lot to take home for next day if you wish! The food is delicious! If you want it spicier your waitress can get you a bottle of Sriracha on the side! Yummy!  Also it's great fresh food!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Very busy. Probably because it's the new and exciting restaurant that the LVJ just reviewed.   Service: Server was super nice and good.  But the line was LOOONNNNGGG.  It took 10 mins to go through the item line.  Then another 25 mins to wait for the food to be cooked.   Food: The bowl is way too small.  You can seriously only get like 5 pieces of meat and a scoop of one vegetable and then your bowl is completely full.  Come on now, it's an endless all you can eat, so why not give us bigger bowls so we can actually put in everything we want.  The sauce are all presented as American barbecue sauces, thick.  The real asian sauces are thin and taste better.  But I'm a Mongolian BBQ snob.   Bottom Line: Good choices of meats and vegetables.  The super tiny bowl was not helpful, and the super long lines made the endless bowl an endless wait.  A food experience, but I don't know if I have that kind of time to just sit and wait.  At $13.99 for an endless bowl, it's almost double what you would pay in California."}
{"text":"Good place!  You pick your raw vegetables, meat and sauce and they cook it for you.  I recommend putting your vegetables in the bottom of the bowl and the meat on top so that the veggies dont fall off.  You pick what kind of starch (noodles, rice) when you give your bowl to the cook.  My only complaint is SLOW SERVICE- takes forever for refills and to get your check."}
{"text":"Seriously...I can't make this stuff up..a blonde chick (an employee at the restaurant) with her feet up on the bar with her gnarly converse shoes was our first visual walking into Genghis Grill...then my daughter heard her say as we were standing at stand waiting for somebody to greet us...\"My shift is over they are just going to have to wait\"..I am glad my daughter told me the comment she made after we had left...anyway the food station was a mess...our actual  \"server\" was nice enough but we will not be going back...the location near paradise valley mall is much nicer and cleaner!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a lot of quality food at a great price. Staff is great and the best thing about the place is my kids love it, and that says A LOT. Try the cookie butter won ton, I think its the best dessert I jave ever had."}
{"text":"I liked this place the 3 times I went... I made my meal: flavor profiles, mixed textures, and overall combination of ingredients.  I found the grill cooking to be good and my choices made the meal taste wonderful.  It was Bennihanna with a kick, all fresh foods, and my choices"}
{"text":"My new \"day after race\" spot. Diners have the ability to include any ingredients to their entree. All palettes can be satisfied from vegetarians to carnivores."}
{"text":"I went to Genghis Grill one evening while the Beijing Olympics were being aired. My experience eating here was probably a lot like Shawn Johnson's experience at the games -- not quite the showing I expected, but GG still managed to eek out a medal or two.  My favorite Mongolian places include soup and salad bars in addition to the ingredients to be grilled; Genghis Grill does not. I missed being able to snack on a salad while waiting on my first bowl.   The ingredients were all fine; most seemed fresh, but I had to avoid a couple of the less popular offereings (for the life of me, I don't understand why bok choy hasn't captured the hearts of the American public). The sauces were generally tasty...think Trader Joe's bottled dressings and you'll get the idea.   The highlight of the night was when I realized the shredded cheese that given to me by request came free and clear. Of course, this made me wish I would have asked for sour cream, too.   You won't see a picture of my experience at the Genghis Grill on a Wheaties box any time soon, but the meal was pleasant enough for a solid three stars."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Pick up a stainless steel bowl, fill it with your meat, then veggies, then seasonings and sauce.  Bring it to the grill.  Awesome with brown rice as the starch.  They do have gluten free sauces and options.  Healthy as you want to make your dish. They use canola oil (not the best, but much better than soybean oil!). Great place and you make it the way you want it."}
{"text":"This place just does not feel clean. We walked in at about 8:30pm for dinner. We were seated right away. When our server came, she took our drink orders (good looking drink menu by the way) but failed to explain the ordering process. When we asked how to order our food, she pointed to the line and explained that we fill a bowl ourselves with what we want in the stir fry, then circle what kind of rice we want on a little card. We walked over to the line and were handed a tray with a stainless steel bowl for the create your own stir fry. The tray felt sticky. Gross. The meat section was first, and there were pieces of raw chicken that people had dropped in a bunch of other containers. Then I witnessed the man in line in front of us use his fingers to push the ground meat off of the tongs and into his bowl before returning the tongs back to the tray of meat. No thank you. The carrots looked like they'd been sliced days ago, all soft looking. Ultimately I put my tray back and decided not to dine here. Will not return."}
{"text":"It seems like everyone had a better experience here than me. Maybe I just went on a bad day.  My biggest gripe about this place is that the veggies didn't look good. I had to pick through the carrots and tomatoes to find ones that looked relatively fresh. The sweet and sour sauce was kind of bland. Service was good though. Our server was friendly and checked on us regularly. Maybe I'll have better luck next time."}
{"text":"Now why would anyone say this is just \"YC's\" only more expensive?  Lets see, YC's has frozen shaved beef, pork, chicken and fish..   GG has FRESH steak and beef. FRESH chicken, fish, scallops  YC's has a few vegi's to choose from.   GG has at least twice as many.  I have eaten there about 15 times since it has been open. So much so I have earned a \"free\" bowl 2 times from my frequent dinner card. I wouldn't hesitate to eat at GG anytime..   I also like that there are more choices for powered spices, as well as liquid sauces. YC's pales in comparison!!  I have never had a problem with staff here and they seem friendly enough.  They have Coke products which is always a must have and a plus!!  Sure GG is a little more than YC's, but remember you get what you pay for!!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets when it comes to Mongolian BBQ.  No cheap meat rolled up and frozen - just a wide assortment of quality meats, vegetables, seasonings, and sauces.  YC's doesn't hold a candle to it.  This is one of only two places I go back to every single time I'm in the Phoenix metro.  I can't wait until a Genghis Grill opens in Orange County."}
{"text":"First visit there only two days ago. Enjoyed numerous great versions of this type of cuisine in San Diego. Recently moved to Peoria I'd planned to get to this place on Bell Road a few times. Thankfully I was able to treat a friend to lunch, someone who had yet to venture to this kind of meal.   The greeting by Bill the manager could not have been more pleasant or sincere. Indeed upon learning it was our first visit, my my friends first ever time trying this out, he even undertook to personally cook our selection. The range of ingredients was exceptional. Sauces and oils were plentiful. Size of bowls was fair and the staff conducting our service was superb. My friend loved the experience so much, we now plan on making it a weekly event. The pleasant unobtrusive well appointed bar will make it a must go to restaurant for our out of state friends. Well done Bill, many thx and see you again soon. Hugh"}
{"text":"Pros : Good selection of meat, veggies, sauces and starches makes building a mongolian BBQ bowl fun and tasty.   Cons : The cost of the drinks seems excessive."}
{"text":"I would definitely like to come back here again! Last week, I tried Genghis Grill for the first time, not knowing what to expect. The whole \"build your own bowl\" concept was actually really cool!   Luckily, my bf and I went for a late lunch so the place was relatively empty (as an indecisive person, I'd probably feel overwhelmed with the amount of options to choose from if there had been a line of people behind me). Lots of meats, vegetables, spices, and sauces offered! They even had 5 or 6 bases to choose from (brown rice, egg noodles, etc).   Despite not knowing what I was doing...I mean, there was no plan or coordination as to what would go well with anything. I was just throwing everything that looked good into the bowl. (Kind of like how I make my FroYo)...mine came out soo well! I think it was about $25 for our 2 medium bowls, which were both very filling and delicious.   An interesting place for lunch, despite its Tempe Marketplace food court-esque location."}
{"text":"I love this place! We come every Sunday night for dinner and love the bartender and the food! We always have full drinks and our food never takes too long to cook. I have never been disappointed when leaving here. The server/bartender is always friendly and helpful and makes sure we have everything we need. Although it is always busy, we never wait to be seated and everything is VERY clean!"}
{"text":"They will greet you and seat you at a table with utensils. They will serve you water.  though the quantity is smaller than YC's Grill and the prices are higher, They don't charge 50 cents for to go boxes like YC's does.  Also, I enjoy the higher quality and greater variety of ingredients. ~*Its really hit or miss depending on what you create*~  My fav : crab meat + scallops + andoullie sausage + lil bit of ham cajun seasoning (2 spoons) + ginger seasoning  tofu, spinach, zucchini squash, lil bit of tomato, mushroom, lil bit of bean sprouts, lil bit of potato,  one big container of szechwan sauce, one small container of garlic chili oil  udon noodles,  and hand it over to the grill guy, and he hands you a number. You stick the number in the holder upper thing at your table.  Takes a big longer than YC's to cook.  but upside is you can go back to your seat and chill, the servers will bring your food to you in a fun looking bowl.  To go boxes are free, so if its too much, get it to go.  there are servers in this place, so expect to spend extra on tips too."}
{"text":"Always great food! Cant beat the amount of food you get for the price. Right next to the theater so have some sake bombers before your movie!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years, best Mongolian food hands down. Wish there was one closer to me as we end up driving 20 minutes. The drink specials make it worth it!"}
{"text":"I loved this place till all the changes came. The food is really good but hard to reach. The prices also changed and went up. If you don't mind paying a little extra for a meal it worth it. They also have a soda machine with like 100 flavors in it."}
{"text":"Mike behind the bar provided great service and the food and environment were on point. 1st time here def coming back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chain for Mongolian. The food is delicious. The only change I would make is bringing back the all you can eat bowl as I still paid for two bowls."}
{"text":"Wow.  Must've been an off day but I arrived when there were lines at every eatery at CLT Airport.  My food was scorched and had a flavor of being burnt.  Never coming here again. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"We were excited to find out that there was a Mongolian BBQ restaurant near us. Unfortunately, we were disappointed that many of the meats were pre-seasoned and pre-cooked. The initial bowls used for filling were small compared to the displayed bowl portions. In the end, the remaining volume was filled by a required starch. The produce choices were interesting and varied. However, when asking about the ingredients of the sauces, we were given very little information."}
{"text":"Started off lunch today with a roach which climbed across the table(witnessed by a server) who squashed the bug and left him. Server stated it was because of the neighboring business and left it at that."}
{"text":"Not your typical Mongolian a-fare, the variety at Genghis Grill - Tempe will keep you coming back to sample the plethora of accessible and affordable Mongolian-style dishes--from stir fried wok bowls to Udon noodle bowls, to the lustrous yet subtle appetizers made fresh. Be it fish, chicken, vegetable, beef or other seafood genres, leave it to the masters at Genghis to bring authentic eastern flair to central Phoenix, at a convenience and price you can't beat with a chopstick.  Be sure to save room for decadent desert!"}
{"text":"The best Mongolian grill place in Vegas, hands down. The staff is attentive and friendly, and it's a great quick lunch or dinner. I just wish it was a bit closer to my home, and I'd eat here 3 or more times a week!"}
{"text":"I thought the food and service were Good as one expects from a buffet. Possible I have been spoiled by Hu Hut in Colorado."}
{"text":"This place has a format I've never seen in the many Mongolian places I've eaten. Usually you get one decent sized bowl and fill it up with whatever you want - meat, veggies, noodles, sauces, etc. then you get rice and  soup on the side. Here you have to pick a bowl size,  preselect your \"starches\" - rice OR noodles. For lunch, the SMALL bowl was $9.99.  I asked if I could have rice on the side and the server said it would be an additional $2.   She asked if it was my first time there. Then she explained how to fill out the card with my name, my bowl size, my \"starches\", then go through the line, pick my meat, veggies, sauces and give it to the stirfry guy.  By the time she got done with explaining, she could have filled it out the card for me.  The small bowl is barely a cup and it was over the top way too fast. The stir fry guy puts in a standard amount of noodles, which wasn't that much... So I can't decide how much noodle I want in my bowl either?   So $10 for a tiny Mongol bowl that wasn't very filling, with no rice, soup or egg roll on the side.  $2.80 for a coke. On the plus side, the ingredients were top quality, and it was nicely cooked. It was nice to have the bowl brought to you, rather than waiting. If you pop the extra $2-4 you probably get a more filling meal.  Next time I go to YC on the east side I will beg them to add a west valley location."}
{"text":"We were looking for something different and I've driven by a bunch of times.  Got seated right away and since we've never been, Bill walked us through the process.  Tons of protein and veggie choices and sauces too.  On to the grill and a few minutes later we were chowing!"}
{"text":"The service left alot to be desired of.  As we arrived, the hostess was polite and friendly and seated us right away.  After that, everything went downhill!  We sat there with not so much as a greeting until the same hostess that seated us had to ask if anyone was helping us.  Finally our server \"Twila\" finally came and told us that she would be with us.  No sorry for the wait, just sort of it's busy, I'll get to you.  Then she came and then when it came time to explain how the place runs and how to get your food she basically said that she wanted to wait until the other table was ready so that she could take us in a group.  Yep, that's why I came out with my family, to make this a group event!  She must have noticed the looks on our faces because she suddenly changed her mind and said well I can just take you now.  Soon after we started eating our food, she came back and dropped off surveys and asked us to fill them out.  Could we have waited until after we ate to do this?  She then came back 10 minutes later and asked if we were going to fill out the surveys or if she should just take them back. Wow this place gives you mandatory homework with your food!    The food itself was just ok.  I have eaten at some much better Mongolian BBQ places but unfortunately they are out of town so my hopes were high for this place.  The sauces were a bit too sweet and thick.  The noodles were a bit undercooked.    At the end of the day the mediocre food is not worth the terrible service."}
{"text":"First trip here was ok, second was my last. The atmosphere and service is spot on. Everyone is very friendly and attentive, so this place gets a high rating in that respect. For the food, there's some good and some bad.  For Mongolian Grill, there is not a lot to choose from for your bowl. Don't get me wrong, I was able to fill it, but once it hit the grill, that was another story. After cooking it up and presenting it to me, all of my meat disappeared.  No joke. I understand that with fish, they move it to the side because it cooks slower.  When they assembled it, it never made it back into my mix.   I like other Mongolian places where you can hang out at the grill and watch the magic, plus interact with the chefs. This place isn't set up that way, which is ok, but I was disappointed with my meal."}
{"text":"Best new experience I've had for dining in a long time"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I've really enjoyed it. This last time though has made me reconsider. My dad was visiting from out of town and I thought this was the perfect place because he loves building his own dishes and he has a big appetite. When we arrived the restaurant wasn't too busy, no one was up at the hostess stand so we waiting to be seated, only about 5 minutes until we were greeted. Our food came out fast, almost too fast. My food was fine, but my dad was saying he didn't think it was cooked all the way through. Our waiter was nowhere to be found, our waters stayed empty. Finally, he came around and we both asked for more noodles, something I do every time I come. The side he brought was so small, definitely smaller than I'm used to. When we got the bill we were charged 1.99 each for the side of noodles! Not worth 2 bucks...and I've never been charged when I ask for extra every other time I've been there. The whole reason I went there over YC's is because you can get extra. I don't know if I got lucky every other time, or he just charged us to charge us. Either way, if you want more starch, make sure you ask if it's extra. Total was $28 for our 2 medium bowls and 2 sides of noodles. When we went to pay our waiter was standing over us as we took out the money and was very quick to get us out. I felt rushed. My dad was very disappointed and thought the food was just OK. Probably could have received a more quality meal for 28 bucks. Not sure if I'll be back...definitely won't recommend. My dad isn't hard to please, so if he's not happy, you know there's a problem."}
{"text":"It's so simple, but I can't help but really enjoy the food. I enjoy about any kind of Mongolian BBQ, but in the valley I have to say GG is better than YC's for three reasons: the sauces are thick and flavorful (not just watery), the meats are not shaved paper thin and super dry, and the meal is cooked long enough to develop a good flavor and slight char on veggies. One tip: ordering online is actually great. You get to choose up to 2 meats, 5 veggies, 2 sauces, etc and they make it for you. They don't skimp and let's be honest, they're better at it than you. The normal bowl is usually enough for a dinner and next day lunch for me, which makes it a reasonable value. I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because dining in was a little awkward the first time--the system with the cards seems a little odd or unnecessarily complicated. Service was good and they were quick to help or explain, though."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service at the bar! I've never felt more like a VIP in a fast-casual restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and so was the service.  The store's general manager stopped by and was very friendly.  We are from Wisconsin.  Wish there was one up here."}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  The service is very poor.  I've never, ever, seen so many employees doing so little in a restaurant this size before.  I've dined there or attemped to dine there twice.  On one occasion I went for lunch on a week day.  The place was fairly busy but there seemed to be plenty of employees in Genghis shirts milling around.  It was hard to tell what they were doing and many didn't seem  to do much.  Our waitress was moderately attentive but the food was good.  On a more recent visit we went for a late lunch on a Thursday.  When we walked in there was a lot of staff either standing around doing little or sort of milling around.  There were about a dozen customers and slightly more staff.  The bartender was away from the bar and was talking to the receptionist.  We clearly interrupted an important discussion.  As it was late we thought we could get in, get fairly quick service, and get out.  We never saw our waiter or waitress.  After some time watching employees mill around (not doing much) and trying to guess who our waiter or waitress would be, we still had no water and no orders taken.  In fact, there had been no contact since the hostess seated us.  We got up and left and once again interrupted the bartender and hostess who thanked us for coming.  We thanked her and then my wife mentioned that we'd had nothing.    Suddenly she remembered who we were and turned to look at the booth she'd seated us.  However, like everyone else she made no effort to make certain our needs were met, she just shrugged and off we went."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I absolutely would I'll keep it short and sweet we walked in and it was super dirty and dirt on the floor dirt on the table and the host did not come up and greet us until maybe 4 or 5 minutes later after we have been told by someone because we got tired of waiting to go back to the front and wait then the service the waitress was absolutely horrid had no enthusiasm act like she didn't even want to be there just kind of shrugged It Off and especially Being our first time there and we told her this then while we were waiting we seen a big cockroach crawling on the back of the couch that kind of did it for it was just a really bad experience if I could give this place 0 Stars I would never going back again and I would definitely not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"By far the worst \"restaurant\" my family and I have been to. It was my first time attending and our server was very amicable and explained the process very well. I cant remember his name but he was very polite and attentive throughout or dinner. Anyways, the restaurant was a little busy so the line for the food was long and it took some time to finally get to the grill. When we finally got to the grill, I let them know what starch I wanted and you could tell they were being rushed by BOTH managers that were on the grill. It made me uncomfortable to see that but I just went on as fast as I could. After 30 mins of waiting for our food we finally get our bowls to which I realized that mine AND my son's were completely wrong. By this point I was extremely aggravated like how could they get our bowls wrong when BOTH managers were on the grill the whole time? I told our server and I saw him try to fix it and talk to the manager about it but all he did was hand him a card and shooed him away. The managers did not even apologize or try to resolve the situations themselves and instead gave all the responsibility to their servers. I'm addition, you could hear the female manager yelling at the young boys in the grill. I was appalled at the treatment of their clientele and their workers and for that I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The service was fine. The grilling chef was very nice. I am not difficult to please, but this food was not good at all and the menu is overpriced. Way overpriced. It's a sad day when you go for dinner with your child , order 2 soft drinks, 1 small appetizer, and two meals, pay 50.00+ and leave hungry because the food is terrible."}
{"text":"My family ate here last weekend. We have all eaten at several \"Mongolian\" type grills in Oregon,California and Arizona. Gengus was by far the worst we have ever eaten at. The meat was in chunks and not frozen as it is at almost every other grill. The choice of veggies left allot to be desired And the sauce making choices were very strange and most of them were full of sugar. Very disappointing! Do yourself a favor and eat at a real Mongolian Grill."}
{"text":"I promised I would update my review! My husband is in love with this place. I'm not a huge fan but it has definitely improved. I think my dislike is that I'm just not a huge mongolian grill fan in general. The staff is generally on point, the GM (Reagan) is super sweet, and they definitely offer an excellent variety of options. It is not taking as long to get food as it did when they first opened. The service is much quicker now. I gave an extra star because my husband and kids love it so much. I'd go with 3 if it were me."}
{"text":"Its seems like a decent place, and certainly has potential, but we wont be back until its more sanitary.  My problem being VEGAN is that the meat station is at the beginning of the line.  This wouldn't be a problem if PEOPLE DIDN'T USE THE VEGETABLE TONGS TO SQUISH DOWN THEIR RAW MEAT into the tiny bowls provided.  I asked the line staff how they prevent cross contamination to which she replied \"I dont understand what that means.\"  Ok, fair enough, she isnt educated.  So I asked for a separate clean tong to use, even though I know that \"meat juices\" are already mixed in with the veggies.  She said they only have one for each container, and no extra clean ones.  At this point I was just too grossed out to eat.  My husband, being a carnivore didnt mind, but has been in the bathroom \"declaring war on Mongolia\" all evening, so I guess my theory could have been correct.   We brought all this up to our waitress, as I would have like to have had dinner there, and she says its the corporate office's decision to have it that way, and had been asked this same question several times before. She mentioned that Muslims should absolutely NOT eat there, as there was NO way of knowing for sure if the food was cross contaminated with pork, and that the sign asking about \"allergies, and special dietary requests\" was a joke.  Until they switch up the order of the stations, Veggies Beware!"}
{"text":"I come here with my boyfriend and it is never crowded when we go. I usually get the chicken or sirloin tips. I prefer the chicken though. We always pile our bowls HIGH! Add some spices and veggies. I get the tomato sauce (2 cups) and usually choose the tortilla. My boyfriend likes to put a little bit of each sauce...yucky. Food is cooked quickly and service is alright. Drinks are a little over priced in my opinion but thats just me."}
{"text":"We have been going here for a long time but today, we are cutting our Genghis Grill card.  We were there about 10 minutes ago and had to leave. We were a party of 6 and was promptly seated. However, we waited a good 15 minutes but no one came to our table to get our drinks. We were totally ignored.  I like going to places because of the food AND customer service. Sadly they have gone downhill. No one seems to be happy to be there and no one even wants any eye contact. Totally different vibe than before.  Now we are seated at a different restaurant enjoying good food and service."}
{"text":"My first complaint is the way prices are not given on the menu or are difficult to find. Even the server didn't know the correct price of the drinks. $10 for a bowl seems high for this style of food. It was a smaller bowl than any other grill I have eaten at.  I asked for brown rice and was served stir fried rice. My wife's food was burnt. The sauces and spices were not that great. The margaritas were good. It is open until 10 or 11 in Glendale. That would have me there often if it where a better buy for the dollar and not being sneaky with the prices. The server, Brittany, was very good."}
{"text":"Yum yum free food for my birthday. Of course a cold Shocktop to wash down this delicious food...and desert too. Man I'm stuffed. I will have to make this a bi-weekly occasion."}
{"text":"Sad they discontinued scallops from build your own bowl. But still great selection of veggies and sauced"}
{"text":"The food is great and they have a lot of great options.  All the veggie looked fresh and tasted great.  They have tons of sauces that you can taste before you pick and great seasonings.  My only real complaint was the service. We went the first week they opened, so I'll give them a break, but they had about 12 servers just standing around & gabbing instead of refilling drinks/doing any type of work.    I'm sure they will work out the staffing kinks and we plan to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Appetizers are a complete joke along with everything about this place. Try to find somewhere else worth spending money at. Service was very slow too. Should have just left during the 15 minutes waiting for a waiter. Not a true barbecue buffet at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a movie and found my new spot! Great drinks, great food and a perfect location right next to Harkins. Will be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up to 4.  My hometown had a BD's Mongolian Grill - I was a big fan, so I was excited to try Genghis Grill.  We went there for lunch on Saturday.  Everyone else already described the experience and the food, but I'll add a little more color:  the food is fresh, the wait staff provide good recommendations if you struggle in making decisions, and the red curry peanut sauce is outstanding with just the right bite.  They even grilled mac and cheese for my toddler daughter - when she chose to color instead of eat, I wasn't upset.  That mac & cheese was GOOD.  Really good.  The only thing I was dissapointed in was that they encouraged us to make our bowls and then sit down.  Part of the fun/experience is 1)  interacting with those cooking your concoction by standing next to the grill, 2) watching as all of these bright colors blend together, and 3) seeing what other combinations everyone around you came up with.  By dropping off your bowl and sitting down (encouraged to do so by giving us a number and saying we'll bring it right out), their patrons miss out.  Again, I'm a fan and will be back....but it could be even better."}
{"text":"I used to come to Genghis almost once a month when I was attending ASU and I loved it but when I was in town this past weekend visiting my experience was very different from what I was used to.  While I was filling up my sauce the manager came up behind me and told me everything had to fit in the bowl (I had placed 2 eggs in a tin cup) I said oh well that's a new rule I never had to do that before. The manager said no it has always been that way and I responded NO it has not actually and he proceeded to tell me that now he is running this place and why it's not going bankrupt. I then had enough of our arguing back and forth and asked how much extra for an egg and he told me $2 per extra egg... which is absolutely insane when you can buy an entire carton for $2!!!! I finally gave up and made a nest on top of my bowl for the egg.  When I sat my waiter Jong was fantastic no complaints on him but throughout my meal the manager kept giving me dirty looks and made me feel very uncomfortable. He never came over to the table or any table for that matter just glared around the restaurant the whole time I was there.    Still love the food  and service from waiter but disappointed in new manager and his ridiculous price on an extra egg and the experience vibe he gave me, very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Very unique vibe! Bar/tv's with Asian food. College kids working here didn't seem to know much...& Service was just OK. Food was great! And I came here to EAT which is why I gave 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Food is better when you make it yourself - that is what genghis grill on regular restaurant.  Too salty and you have no control over it.  Asian order takers is a good touch but you need to be able to converse proficiently in English.  They don't even offer build you own because she didn't speak or understand English good enough.  Good food but needs better service."}
{"text":"Genghis Grill (in case you haven't already realized) is a mongolian grill.  You get a bowl, go the buffet line, put various meat/veggies/sauces in the bowl.  Then, you give it to the grill person and sit down.  As others have said, you don't wait at the grill - your server will bring you the food after you sit down (unlike the ubiquitous YC grill).  I would say the quality is better than YC.  Probably because the food is fresh rather than frozen.  Variety is also superior to YC - you have the usual fish ad pork, but you can also add various steak options, scallops, fish, and squid!  Awesome.  Lots of veggie options, and you can add egg(s).  The sauces are thick and flavorful.  It's also nice that you can pick from rice in addition to noodles.  My main complaint?  The portions are way small.  You can order all-you-can eat, but it's an extra $4 (maybe even $5? I don't recall exactly)...  I'm sure this is a cost-saving tactic, but jeez, stingy."}
{"text":"I used to go to the one in Tempe all the time so I was pretty excited to find out they had a new one on Cactus by my new house. My experience at this one was just off...  - Food station was a mess - Staff was just kind of there, not as upbeat as Tempe - The potatoes I had in my bowl were really hard for some reason. - Not certain, but I think this one might have cost a little more than Tempe.  Overall, just didn't have the energy and execution that I was accustomed to."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Ash is the best restauranteur ever. Food is amazing and service is stellar. Best happy hour you will find. 2 everything's all day!"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times. Well I came in on Wednesday night after a super stressful day and little to my surprise, it was probably one of the best experiences I have had there. The waiter we had, Aaron, was awesome and upbeat and blew every other time I have been there out of the water. I even asked him if he can follow me to every other restaurant that I go to! When we got the check, my boyfriend and I were arguing over who got to pay the bill so I gave both of our cards to Aaron so he can put them behind his back and randomly pick one. He asked if he should get the other tables around us involved to pick the card and I said of course! It was just an overall fun experience"}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical because it seemed like the food wouldn't turn out good.  I got it to-go and when I got home, I loved it.  I loved the customization.  Its like Chipotle but Benihana style."}
{"text":"The food is really good and I like that you get to pick all your items. However, the bar sucks. Not only does it have slow service but they also give you barely any alcohol in your drinks and you could leave with a stomach ache from all of the mix they give you."}
{"text":"First of all I have flagged JT's message, and I hope Yelp removes it. Second, I don't eat way too much nor like a \"champ\", and I am not dumb. I have been to several other Mongolian grills, and I have never had to \"press down\" my vegetables. A better solution to this problem, as I suggested, would be to give a slightly bigger bowl. As for the menus, they were not useful like JT had mentioned, so really they didn't need to sit on my table the whole time. Furthermore, maybe I wanted to look at the drink menu, even though our server did not ask us what we would like to drink. Which in my opinion is pretty standard at a sit down restaurant.    \"I don't know where Allison has been to eat but normally you give your bowl to the person that cooks it and they give it back on a plate.\"   In response to this portion of the comment... at this particular restaurant they do not give your food back on a plate... it came back in a bowl, a much larger bowl than the one I had originally \"filled up\" (without pressing the veggies down). Maybe this JT gentleman has not been to this particular restaurant.   I rated this two stars, or as yelp says, \"Meh. I've experienced better\", which I am comparing this one too. I was rating the overall experience not the quality of my food. Yelp serves as a place to review places based on your personal opinion not to name call or pick on an individual person. For those of you who might not be able to see JT's original comment, it wasn't helpful or accurate (and why did he keep saying my name?, that was odd). You didn't miss out on anything of importance from that guy. Thanks! : )"}
{"text":"Disgusted with this place. Went here for my husband's birthday dinner. Bad choice.   Agree with the other review about the sneeze guard, you cannot reach the third row. There is food spilled ALL over.   The wait staff act as if your table was their first serving experience. My glass should never be empty for 15++ minutes.   Food was a little less than decent. In my opinion, the food should have been free, because I left being very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"My boyfriend keeps raving about this place, so we decided to try it out together the next time we were in Charlotte. I have to say I really like this place. The people were very nice and accommodating. The food was good. I had a veggie udon noodle meal with ton of spices and their garlic and crush pepper sauce. I really like the sauce. The way they cook the food is cool. They use two huge sticks that looks like huge chopsticks to mix it together. I would so go here again."}
{"text":"I am sorry, I heard great things about GG so took the family to the Arrowhead location in Glendale,AZ. The service was good, Iced tea was fresh. Sake price for happy hour was a great deal! BUT I was very disappointed with the cleanliness. There was food everywhere, and I felt it unsanitary to even get the chicken when I saw the tongs had actually fallen into the container. The people behind me asked for more marinated steak because all you saw was a red liquid. The guy brought it out and said \"More meat! Less blood!\" (HIS WORDS EXACTLY) I  almost gagged. Also, the meat station smelled awful. Fresh meat and seafood should not have a foul odor. And you should be able to tell what kind of meat it is. Only the turkey looked decent.The carrots were brown and a lot of the veggies looked limp, the mushrooms looked like they needed to be washed. I feel the place would benefit if they just cleaned it up and put out fresh food. And more variety of sauces that are not so salty! Most of them tasted the same, with a sodium overload. I don't understand this when you have all the dry salt powders near the meat station, then load up on salty sauce? Now being half Thai, I love Asian food, my mom used to own an award winning Thai restaurant back in the day before Thai exploded everywhere.  I did not come here for gourmet food, I came because I heard it was fresh and I could get exactly the ratio of veggies and meat to noodles that I wanted and it was open late. I guess in all fairness we went around 8:30pm. So after the dinner rush, but still no excuse to not wipe down the food area. Afterall they are open till 11pm!"}
{"text":"The food was great as usual but the service sucked... Brittanee ,my waitress, was more concerned about the college boys sitting across from us, so much so that she she forgot our straws! When we asked for to go containers she argued with me about giving me a bigger container!!! Needless to say her tip was ...pay closer attention to your customers! Being new is no excuse and telling customers your new won't get you sympathy.... #3StarsForTheFood"}
{"text":"this place is perfect to get stuffed with food and/or drinks.   ill start with the drinks. the all day (fri and sat til 7p) happy hour specials switch depending on the day. but you can get at least a bud light draft or well drink for just $1 or $2.   small bar area if you just want to drink too. nice to pre-game a cine-capri movie...or shopping?  food: build your own bowl with a pretty good selection of meats, veggies, spices, sauces, etc.. the bowl may seem kinda small, but youre not adding the noodles or sauces in it. you can even practice on their website.......it can make about 2 meals...even for me. its $10 dinner and $14 for 'all you can eat'. not sure how that works tho.  (i signed up to their club and got a free birthday bowl!). some of what i mixed in was some chicken, marinated steak, pork, beef, celery, peppers, with a crazy concoction of spicy sauces. i cant wait to get home and chow on the rest!  those wacky mongolians really know whats up. its really that simple."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about 3 different times in the past 2 months and I don't know why the low ratings.  Even though I use the cards to help guide my decision making process, I make it my own and it turns out good or great.  You really can't blame them for a bad taste because you chose the ingredients.    The last time I went they upgraded their system to where you could order from your table and have it brought out to you...however, I like the challenge of stuffing your bowl as high as possible...and then eventually toppling over and apologizing for the mess.   Service has been really good, once you get over the chipotle meets a sit down restaurant hybrid feel.    Its almost $9 a bowl, but you get your moneys worth.    I recommend them."}
{"text":"1st time here was absolute best experience ever. Great employees and food is out of this world! Best food I had so far since I've moved here. Environment is very welcoming. It's about 6 miles from my house but it's is absolutely worth the drive.!"}
{"text":"First time visitor. A friend recommended this place and it definitely did not disappoint. The food tasted so fresh and I was impressed by all the options. I went for lunch and the portion was just perfect. It's definitely not a cheap meal but I don't mind spending $15 on a quality lunch, so I felt I got my money's worth. I got the chicken and shrimp with tons of veggies and brown rice. Normally I'm hesitant to order brown rice at a restaurant but I gave GG a chance and it was perfection, not mushy or chewy. I added a little too much sauce though. A couple downsides... I don't like the seating arrangements. I felt like I was practically sitting with the table next to me. Also the pepper/onion mix was kind of frozen and almost out and I felt like I was digging it out so I had a lot of chunks instead of big pieces. The food station was also really messy. I also was worried about cross contamination because there were no staff members over seeing the food bar. I guess everything gets cooked but it still worries me. Overall I really liked this place and I'll definitely be back and recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh unique meal!"}
{"text":"Love their food but they got rid of the kids meal deal and keep raising their prices! I also heard you have to stack your food a certain way now and I don't know why'd they care considering what you pay to eat here over most restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"Arrived at this place for an afternoon lunch with some co-workers.  I had the firecracker bowl (calamari, shrimp, scallops) a lot of veggies, and 2-3 different types of hot sauces on pasta.  I think the noodles may have been a better idea - but they also had fried rice and steamed white rice.  Only 3 stars because:  1. The bowl was smaller than I've seen it most places. 2. The seafood was cooked to the point of \"chewy\". 3. The spice was not nearly as advertised.  Pros: Clean, friendly staff.  I'd probably return, but not until I've tried other places."}
{"text":"The concept is neat, making your own stir fry with the exact ingredients you want in the exact amounts you choose, but it's not my favorite place to go for Asian food.   First of all, I'm not sure how much I like choosing everything on my own. The ingredients are set out like a buffet with everything from meat, to veggies, to the sauce waiting for you to pick them. This can be overwhelming, especially if you aren't sure what you want or which combination would taste good. They do have a few recipe cards that you can use as a guide, but they only provide you with a few ideas, most of which aren't appealing to me. When I create my own bowl, it always tastes okay, but I'm left wondering what I could have done to make it taste better. Maybe some extra seasoning or a different veggie would have balanced the flavors more? Unfortunately, unless you get the unlimited bowl option, you only have one shot to get it right.  Second of all, as with all buffets, you question the cleanliness. I think this is even more of a concern for me as they have all the raw meat laying out there in the open. It makes me wonder if there's any cross contamination going on, or if someone sneezed all over the food. I'm sure it is probably kept clean, but I'm one of those people who worries about that type of thing. Also, I don't find heaps of raw meat that appetizing, but it probably doesn't bother most people.  My last point is, I'm always wondering why they chose to have waitstaff that you are expected to tip. Since you do most of the work yourself: choose the ingredients, fill up your own bowl, and bring your bowl to the grill guys, there really isn't much left for the waitstaff to do. I know they bring drinks and appetizers if you choose to order them, but it seems like this place should work more like a Smashburger or a Panera Bread where the style is more counter service.   Overall, I like it okay. I'll eat here if someone suggests it, but it's not someplace I think about going to on my own."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened, but I hadn't been here in the last year.   The food is still good, but the service has noticeably degraded over time.   My kids and I arrived and no waitress would stop in our area, so we decided to get our food.   The table next to us was dirty from the previous guests.   It remained in the sane condition until we left.  We still hadn't seen a waitress until they brought our food.  At which time I asked for drinks. The waitress apologized, but it seemed disingenuous as was confirmed by the fact that when we needed refills, there was no one around to ask.   Getting the bill, and having the waitress come back for the payment was the same story."}
{"text":"After a long day at work my coworkers and I were super excited to go to this location and chow down. Knowing that they were closing in fifteen minutes we made sure to communicate to each other to make the process as quick as possible. When we we arrived we were greeted by annoyance. We could all tell that we were unwelcome and that most of the workers were talking about us. Some of us had never been here so we asked questions and were answered with obvious sarcasm. A little disgruntled we still decided to eat. So we went through the line and made our bowl and when it came to the point of grilling, because no one explained anything to us, one of my coworkers had put sauce on top of her bowl and was advised that her food would be rinsed or else it would burn. Ummmm.... so then I ask if we should wait for the food to be cooked to take it to the table and get a a sarcastic \"sure but we bring it to your table anyways\". I literally almost lunged at him. So holding myself back I went and sat at the table. My coworker ordered a drink and 2 minutes later we were told the bar was closed earlier but they'd still make it. Why tell us if it was going to be made anyways? To make sure we knew that we were an inconvenience? As we are eating, my coworker (vegetarian), picks out a shrimp out of her food... which she obviously she did not put in there. She did not mind, they were lucky, but I would have. To top it off we were waiting for them to take the checks and they decided to turn the music off and turn the lights as bright as they could go. Extremely disappointed. They definitely will not be receiving our service ever again. We all enjoy food and fortunately our work brings in a lot of visitors from other countries and states so we will definitely let them know where not to go! The only part that was a light out of this dark experience was Daisy. She had a great attitude and apparently realized customer experience was important no matter the time. YCS FOR LIFE!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. My colleagues and I went here on our lunch and it was fantastic. The scenery & vibes was a 10. They checked on us and was very friendly. They explained to us how it work, we all chosen large bowls. We were told its no limit on how high we can stack it. Everything was cooked Perfectly. The taste was beyond grate. Flavorful and yummy! I can't complian! If you haven't tried it please GOOOOO NOW!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. This is the second time my fiance and I have been here. I love the build your own bowl and how they are attentive. We tried the chicken pop stickers as an appetizer and they were very very good. Thanks to our waitress who recommended them. I also love the fact that you can have all you can drink soft drinks. I prefer the Ice Tea. It is so fresh and refreshing. I would recommend this place for lunch or even a Date night. They also have a bar and my fiance had the Long Island Ice tea and it was good! We will be back. They also do take out in case you just want to pick up a bowl to go. You can build your won to go!"}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's Day. Bad idea. I have eaten at other Mongolian Grills in California that are way better. There is no style in this place. It is nothing fancy. It reminds  me of a burger joint, not a special occasion place. You can order pre made dishes or make your own bowl. Food is cooked fresh. They use too much sodium in some dishes, so watch what you order. When I was there there were no other dinners in the place. They did nothing special for the holiday. Good was OK, but nothing special. It may be OK for a guys night out, but not for Mom."}
{"text":"This place is under new management. Gonna say we will not be going back. Something we were never charged for extra they did. The manager even said this time I wont but just so u know that's extra. Then we get the bill and they charged us for it anyways. I don't mind paying extra for something but we never had this problem before."}
{"text":"This cracks me up. If the food didn't taste good to you, it is *your* fault.   They give you a lot of different meats and veggies to choose from (more than I've seen at any Mongolian grill I've been to) which are fresh and then many different seasonings and sauces to choose from, plus a selection of about 6 different starches to choose from. There is absolutely no way your food not appealing to you is their fault unless they burnt it or overcooked it. The key to good tasting food when you're dealing with fresh is always gonna be seasoning/sauce quality/amount and cooking temp/length. If they burnt your food, overcooked it, the sauce was bland or nothing was fresh to begin with, then I would side with people on the food probably being the restaurant's fault but I've seen no one mention anything about any of these factors... The food was fresh, the sauces and seasonings on the food at my table were flavorful and nothing was burnt/overcooked.  You choose everything that goes into your meal and the amount of it and therefore make it as flavorful or bland as you choose.   Tips for the nervous: - Don't go heavy on the seasonings, or mix them unless you know they will taste good together. - Don't mix sauces unless you know they will taste good together. - Make sure you have enough sauce to coat your food (fill the cup about half way) unless you like less saucy food. - Stack your food high. You have to pile the food as high as you can without it toppling over. Veggies and meat cook down quite a lot. This place even recommends you stack as high as you can. If you do this, you will have a very good sized entree. The price at dinner time ($9.99) seemed very decent for what I ended up with and I didn't need to go back for more ($4 extra for unlimited returns) - Put a splash of the garlic water in your bowl if you like garlic. It usually doesn't clash with any sauce and adds extra flavor. - If you have any food allergies or are vegetarian, they will clean the massive communal grill off specifically for you. They will ask you about this when you hand off your food. - If you really don't know what to put together, they have recipes you can choose to follow.  All in all, the food was good but then that was my mostly my own doing, LoL. I liked the taste of the sauce and seasonings I chose though; flavorful. As I said, everything's fresh. Nothing's wilted or off looking. Maybe if you're deadly serious about the freshest freshness and need veggies that were pulled from the earth that very morning and might still have some dirt on them, you'll be annoyed, but otherwise, it's fresh. Don't be that way. My only criticism is that the place is quite small for the almost buffet style dining it has. If it's fairly busy, you're going to be squeezing by people and tables to get to the food. Once you hand your food off to be cooked though, you can then go sit down and don't have to stand around and wait for it. One of the servers will bring your food to your table when it's ready.  If you enjoy Mongolian grills, you will like it. If you've never been to a Mongolian grill and like to try different dining experiences, I say try it. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Okay. I've now been to the Grill two times. When you first walk in, it screams \"franchise\".  That should be somewhat of a warning for you. It's a 'bare bones\" kinda place and that should be your second \"clue\".  Wish I had gone there when it first opened a couple of months ago.  Perhaps I would have a different view of the level of cleanliness.  I suspect that it was sparkling when it first opened.  It don't sparkle now, friends.  The waitstaff is friendly enough and explain the concept for the first-timers.  On both occasions I found the staff to be attentive so that's a plus for them.  There's an area of seating that quite frankly you are sitting \"cheek-to-cheek\" with your fellow diners, if you know what I mean.  The tables are VERY close to each other. I would avoid that area at all costs.  The first time I ate there, I did notice a couple of calamari in my meal that I didn't put there.  That should have been an indication to me to watch the grill the next time while they cooked my food.  Also I was not happy with the white fish \"swimming\" in what I hope was water.  Passed by that one.  I'm a Vegetarian so the raw chicken, turkey, beef, etc was quite unappealing.  Overall I have been happy with the meals that I selected...simply because I was able to select my own veggies, sauces, spices, etc...and I like that.  I would be happier if the buffet area was kept cleaner, with the spillage cleaned up regularly.  The noise level (music) is near ear-splitting, so going to eat AND try to read is not possible.  I'm sure I'll go again, but I'll have my meal \"to go\" and I'll stand by while they cook my order - making sure that; the grill is cleaned before they cook it - or I'm outta there!"}
{"text":"They seem to be in the middle of a transition, changing the menu to add special entrees and such. The manager was walking around tonight offering patrons random FULL entrees for free, just to try ! That type of atmosphere is what will guarantee my return - goodonya GG."}
{"text":"Too much going on, place is filled with cross contamination and confusion plus the food sucked!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten Mongolian BBQ in many places/countries.  My family and I really like this restaurant.  However, the thing that we didn't like was that some of the meats were in chunks and pre-cooked.  The pork had sort of a nasty taste ---  like it was old.  This is not the way true Mongolian BBQ is prepared.  ALL meat should be thinly sliced and never pre-cooked.  We weren't familiar with all of the sauces ---far too many, but we adjusted and enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"The place was clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful and the food was fresh and delicious. I will definitely be going back! These folks know how to do it right. I have sampled a variety of bowl / sauce combinations and they are all great. You cannot go wrong with going here. One of my favorite fast dining options in AZ."}
{"text":"This is a textbook example of a place that started out great and went downhill quick.  I started coming here the week they opened and I loved it. It USED to be healthy, good tasting food. I would come two to four times a week.  The first couple months were great. But, as time went on, the food quality declined further and further. I went today (for my last time) and saw the garbage they were passing off as \"marinated steak\". It looked like meat slop one step away from the pink slime chicken that McDonalds supposedly used. It tasted about as good as it looked, slimy, gritty, and just plain disgusting.  It seems they've thinned out their sauces too, they used to be a lot thicker.  Anything to save a buck, right?  I guess that's how it is nowadays, you get them in the door early with good food and service, but once you're \"established\" you can pull the plug and hope they keep coming? Who are they kidding. I'll just go somewhere else.  Now they have the self serve coke machines too. I don't mind it, the variety is great, but now it's just ridiculous that they even have servers. All the server does is bring me my bowl. And I supposed to tip? Might as well just make it counter service, since that's all it is anyways."}
{"text":"Going to make this review short and sweet. I've been a big fan of Mongolian Grills for a long time. YC's being my favorite. So I decided to give this place a try. The decor was fine, the waiter was professional, and the little tablets on the table are cool. There was one thing that REALLY bothered me about this place, that is the handling of Raw meat. There is a station where you make a selection and the gentleman running it was a teenager who really seemed like he didn't want to be there (or care to much about handling raw meat properly) so that really grossed me out and from what I saw there was a very high chance of cross contamination. And for that reason I will probably never return."}
{"text":"Service was great although it wasn't that busy! Had a pregnant server who checked in on my table more than enough. Drinks never went empty. Food was great! Bayou bowl is highly recommended with udon noodles instead of rice!"}
{"text":"Genghis Grill usually has good food for very expensive prices. The service is usually lackluster, and don't make the servers mad. Last time I went and asked for a new server, she went back to the cooks and told them to spit in my families food (the cooks told us after). Good food, but be careful"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for valentines day. Our server was pleasant and there was no wait. I tried the Cajun seasoning with chicken and ginger citrus/honey soy sauce. The result was awesome! I wish there were a location in the university area."}
{"text":"Our service is usually not so great here (empty drinks & not checked on often) but today the service matched the food. So great!! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone & everyone. :)"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed in our visit. Went on a Saturday night. The waiting area was very disorganized. The resturant is congested when busy and awkward getting around. They give you a small metal bowl with directions on how to fill it and then take it over to the grill guys. The line, which is like a buffet, was slow and awkward especailly getting the vegetables. If you have someone who doesn't know what they want in front of you, it holds up the whole line. They do have 2 lines (both were slow).   Between the people and the awful sounding loud music, it was hard to hear even sitting across the table. Service was a bit slow. And to top it off, my wife, who was wearing white pants, sat in some spilled soy sauce and stained the back of her pants. The waitress offered some napkins. The manager seemed like he didn't give a crap. Waitress should have wiped the seat after the last table.  The food was good, not fantastic, but good. The bowl didn't fill me but didn't want to go through that again so I didn't opt with the endless bowl. We basically served ourselves. There is really no need for any waitresses.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"friendly helpful staff. good quality food. fast efficient service. All the qualities you are looking for in a family friendly neighborhood restaurant. The perfect place for the family to dine after a day out at the soccer or baseball fields, so take a break from the pizza joints and visit a restaurant that is truly unique."}
{"text":"We mostly went for the fun experience. I hadn't been to a Mongolian bbq place since high school and my SO had never been to one. For the most part the waitress did a good job telling us what to do. The only confusing and unclear part is that you are supposed to put your sauce in a separate bowl. We didn't know that so we ended up with way too much sauce.   But the food was tasty and filling at the restaurant and the next day at home."}
{"text":"Great place to go, especially with a group since everyone can get something that is ok for their diets.  I have friends with food algeries and this place is fantastic for that!!!"}
{"text":"I was enjoying my meal until a friend returned from the food service counter and told the group he just witnessed a gigantic cockroach moving inches from the food; suddenly my apatite was stymied; won't be returning for a very,very long time."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. We moved to CA & visit AZ often. We always stop for dinner at Genghis when we are in town. Sadly, this last weekend will be our last time eating here. It appears the portion bowls have gotten smaller, or they just add less noodles & rice... either way, we were highly disappointed in the quantity of food we got for the money. In addition to the smaller portions, they took away the all you can eat option. On the way home, we stopped somewhere else because my husband was still hungry.   They ran out of rice noodles... we got there at 5:45 on a Saturday night & they were already out of noodles. Very poor planning. It also seems like they changed their sauces because the flavors were way off. Guess I should have used the tasting spoons but since I use the same sauce and spices every time, I didn't think I needed to.   The waitress asked us if we needed anything & I told her we needed napkins. There were only two napkins and 5 of us eating. Well, napkins never came. We ended up tearing our napkins so everyone could use something.  I was told they are under a new owner & that is unfortunate because the place seems to have gone way downhill. Sometimes penny pinching doesn't pay off."}
{"text":"Read a few of the negative reviews below and felt like I had to respond.  First of all if you limit yourself to the size of the bowl then of course you will leave hungry.  However if you know how to stack your bowl properly you will not only leave full but will have enough left over for another meal.  There are several GG in Az and my husband and I ate there A LOT when we lived in Phx.  I always took it as a personal challenge to see how high I could pile my bowl.  I've gotten it so high before that they had to serve it to me in two of their red bowls.  So if you leave the GG hungry its because you barely put anything in the bowl, and yes veggies do shrink.  As far as the Mongolian BBQ thing... Its not a mongolian BBQ its a grill.  Its very similar to any other Mongolian grill ive ever been to with the exception of the high quality meats they have at the GG.  So pretty much its up to you how your food tastes because you make your own sauce.  I have been a regular at the GG for years(granted not this location) and have always left happy and full.  I was very excited to see one here in Las Vegas and after dining there I can say they did not disappoint.  The service was fantastic, the staff was friendly, and the manager came out several times to check on us.  I think this place is def worth a stop.  Be sure to try and figure out how to maximize your tiny bowl.  A little creative stacking goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  rice overcooked and soggy.  Almost no teriyaki sauce, too much pineapple.  I fly thru Charlotte frequently.  Won't be recommending this.  It doesn't have any of the freshness I expect from Genghis Grill!"}
{"text":"All i can say the worse server,  they forgot our order, they dont know how to handle there customer well. Everyone is rushing no quality at all."}
{"text":"The food here is great but the service sucks. You have to wait a long time for everything. We waited 35 minutes to be seated on a Wednesday night. Then we waited another 10 minutes for our server to appear. Then stood in line another 12 minutes to get the stuff for the grill. Our food was served after 15 minutes. We were gonna do bottomless but our server was nowhere to be found. When she finally showed up we were so annoyed with all the waiting that we just asked for the check instead. We wanted to be fair so we gave this place another chance. Went back on a Monday night, same story. Never coming back again. I can get the same quality of food with more efficient service somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing its one of our favorite restaurants, whenever we have a special occasion this is the first place on our list! The most amazing staff I've seen! Very friendly staff by far one of the best unique restaurants ever!"}
{"text":"I go here about three times a month. The food is good, well it depends on you :). The problem here is the service, it is soooooo bad. Seriously, most the time I only see the waiter for the drinks then for the bill. No refills, nothing. It is always packed. They don't care."}
{"text":"Love this place.... only thing, it is kind of hard to reach some of the products......MOST of the staff if friendly (some are snotty)... Sign up for the purchase card & get a free bowl on the 10th bowl..."}
{"text":"Genghis Grill is an awesome spot for the authentic Mongolian grill experience. Fresh meats, seafood and vegetables make this new chain far superior to YC's.. The biggest difference is that they suggest to put the sauce on last, which gives the food a far better flavor.  (it burns off any other way) you would think YC's would have figured that out over the years. Genghis also features a full bar with include a daily sake bomber special. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I saw this place and with all the excitement do to it having a happy hour and great atmosphere I too was excited to try it.  We saw a cheaper Japanese style rest. next door.  Due to the loud ambiance from Genghis we decided to try it.  I am sorry we did.  The flavor of the food was terrible and I ended up with a stomach ache later that night.  I took most the food home and offered it up to my kids and friends but after one bite no one wanted more.  Ended up throwing it away. We decided to try their next door neighbor the next week we went to Tempe Market Place.  Wow, I was so impressed with the food there.  The night staff were great too.  So I suggest to anyone interested in some quality Japanese food, keep walking past Genghis and go next door."}
{"text":"Been there with friends tried first time nice place silent n chill place worth for money"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times now, and it's been very good every time.  The selections are good as are the sauces.  They cooked it very well, everyone was very friendly and attentive, and we were in & out in under 45 minutes. The prices are higher than they were, but I think for what you get, it's reasonably priced - and draft beers were $2/$3 - can't beat that.  This is the only one that I've been to, but we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Mongolian BBQ, and this place is such a fresh take.  Every time I go I can get something new and create my own.  The sauces are just awesome and I love that you can chose different portion sizes for just how hungry you are.  The staff always seems nice and it is a fun place for a casual dinner out."}
{"text":"I like this place, though not as much as my parents, who go constantly. It's a pretty reasonably priced Mongolian stir-fry place. The food is pretty good. I normally get the beef bowl, which I prefer with the udon noodles (though brown rice is okay too). The food is pretty solid in terms of quality, though with all places like this I tend to burn myself by overthinking the spice selection (too much cayenne pepper today, because I forgot that it's spicy as heck). I'm also not a fan that you get one bowl and one shot unless you want to pay $4 extra for unlimited food, but I'm cheap. It's good, fast and interesting."}
{"text":"Really delicious food! I piled mine up high and it's awesome because you get to have different types of meat at the same time!I'm not into veggies so got to add extra meat at no extra cost which is a plus in my books. Only drawback is that you can only go once Ask for eggs if you want them in your rice because they don't have them on he menu! Sitting is also a bit tight with seats close to one another and only a few of them, so avoid peak times if you can!"}
{"text":"This place had fresh food and was really friendly staff. My daughter didn't like what she picked to eat and the manager got her a new bowl and snuck in it in in front of the long line for her. Love it when they cater to families!"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped here on a quick getaway trip to AZ. Great food - fresh and plentiful. Also the atmosphere was fantastic. We really liked the combo, bar/Mongolian BBQ setup. Most Mongolian BBQs we have near us are very small and don't offer the same vibe. If we ever get back to Tempe, we'll definitely stoop again!"}
{"text":"I am impressed with this place time and time again. Great service, great selection, and great food. I had a bowl full of a ton of chicken, by the time I got a drink and washed my hands, the bowl was ready at my table. If you come before 4 you can even take advantage of even lower price bowls. Will recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is sub par. First of all, the staff is only just nice enough to warrant the feeling of welcome. I felt that waiting on us was tolerable and it really reflected in our attitudes back. It wasn't that pleasant an experience.   About our food: We got edemame that was over cooked and burned 4 times and each time the girl just apologized and they tried again. We finally told them to stop trying when they offered to remake them a 5th time. Our bowls were all over cooked and soggy like they overcooked it and tried to fix it by adding water, totally ruined the flavors I picked. Half the ingredients were missing from the final product.I would not recommend this place for anything more than 2-3 simple ingredients at lunch time maybe. I won't be back. YC's is 100x better."}
{"text":"Good food, good looking female servers, our male server was a goofball and very confusing."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could consider this place disgusting. It's delicious!!! You know it's buffet style so you can pick and choose what you want in your bowl. Love the idea!! The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a solid Monglian BBQ establishment. I am not knowledgeable when it comes to Asian style cooking so my first vist to a MBBQ was not the best experience. Concocting the sauce part was way too diffiicult to achieve so my plate was a soggy, overly sauced salty dish. I was introduced to Genghis Grill by a buddy of mine who understood my dilemma so when he took me here, I was a bit relieved to hear they had pre-made sauces. Overall, the meat is fresh (not served frozen) and the vegetable section is quite good. I was disappointed with two things here 1: Bowls are very small. Since only one trip to the bar is allowed, for those who have quite an appetite will have to do a lot of topping as much as possible    2: Price is not cheap.   3: Service is somewhat lacking considering that this is a wait-staffed eatery."}
{"text":"Can't even compete with YC's. Sauces were either blah or strange tasting and overall, just not very good. Its edible, just not as enjoyable."}
{"text":"Pretty standard chain-quality fare.  This concept popped up 20 years ago and wins at what it is: the kids have a fun time picking out their ingredients.  It would get old if overdone, but as a once-in-a-while stop it is fun.  Service can be pretty erratic."}
{"text":"The hospitality is AWESOME! So is the food! The variety of meats, seafood, veggies and extras will surprise you. Definitely worth the drive and $. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"First off, I have no knowledge of \"real\" mongolian bbq. Whether it's \"the whitest mongolian bbq ever\" or not, all I know is that it was DAMN GOOD!   Authenticity aside, I had no idea what I was doing when I walked in. Met some friends there for a quick get together before heading off to a movie. I was given a bowl...just an empty bowl and a line full of goodies to fill it with. I was told the idea was to fill the bowl as high as you can! My friends took full advantage of that. My only complaint is the labels were kind of mixed up and I couldn't tell what something was. I just asked a lot of questions. Perhaps I missed it somewhere but a quick description of the seasonings would have been helpful too. Again, I just asked plenty of questions so I had a good first experience. Plus, it wasn't busy so I could afford to do so.  I piled my bowl high with marinated beef strips, sausage, veggies galore and just your basic stir fry sauce. The shape of the bowl is interesting but so cute! The service was just so cool. When I asked about dessert, the waitress was honest about what she liked and what she didn't. I'm so glad I took her advice on dessert. I was so impressed by everything they offered! All and all, I loved my experience and I hope to come back soon!!  My final opinion is that you really don't need a bottomless bowl because I couldn't even finish one bowl! Had to take that shizz to go!"}
{"text":"Here, if you food sucks, it's your own fault. You make you own thing and they cook it. It turned out good for me. I think they get all their stuff shipped in frozen though. The raw chicken they had on the line had frost on it still, and who knows how long it sits there.I will go again though. Maybe try something super HOT! You can make something Asian or Mexican, whatever you feel like. They even give tortillas."}
{"text":"A very updated and modern version of Mongolian BBQ. This chain offers some very contemporary items, such as Pico Gallo, crab, veggy mixes, etc. Super clean location, with an extremely cheerful and helpful staff. Also, whatever you don't finish, you can take home. A tad bit pricy for this style of dining, but nothing that would discourage anyone from a healthy option for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I love the fresh selections and sauces!! This is a fun place with the fire wok in the back and full Bar!  you get fresh seafood/chicken/pork or steak and veggies galore...i love that they already have th sauces made so you just pick what flavor..not have to make a sauce yourself  Oh! and when you purchase the signature glass you get 3 dollar beers everytime you go back - just show them the receipt  or bring your GG glass...I suggest fried rice but the Noodles are the Best!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this place 5 stars but the cooking of the food, especially the meats, is just too inconsistent. It's a bit of a crap shoot if they cook your chicken or turkey all the way through, so you risk a bit of salmonella. Plus they may get a bit wild with mixing your ingredients with the person's next to you. So you may end up with 8 shrimp in a bowl you didn't put shrimp in, or your food may be incredibly salty even though you didn't add any salt or spices that were mixed with salt or any sauces to your ingredients. Perhaps that's why they ask you if you have any food allergies or special instructions before they cook your food. I guess you have to say, \"Yes... don't mix my food with other people's and cook the poultry all the way through.\"  They ask you every time you come in if \"you've dined with them before\". I get that they want to guide you through the bowl making process if you're new, but when you're there 3 times a week, it gets old. With an instructional video that plays near the ingredient bar, plus attendants behind the bar to assist you and answer questions, I think they can safely eliminate the question when you're greeted.   The other thing that sorta rubs me the wrong way is the barrage of people who come up to you while you're eating to ask \"How's the bowl?\" There's nothing wrong with an occasional  visit from your server to ask if there's anything you need, or to refresh your drink but their system is more than overkill.   Lastly is the Manager's unsightly, long chin beard (no mustache). Aesthetically, I'm pretty sure this is just my issue that I need to get over, but he also cooks over the food with no beard net and no hair net or hat.  I continue to return to this restaurant because there are very few places near work that allow you to make healthy choices while offering a variety of flavors. The staff is also very friendly and extremely helpful (including beard Manager guy) if you have issues with your food. I just wish they'd make a few tweaks to deserve a higher rating."}
{"text":"Same concept as Salsarita's, except it's Mongolian bbq...save your money and go down the block to Hibachi Grill if you want customized cooking...the ingredients are better...the people that have given Genghis Grill a star above 3 are fooled by the gimmick of being your own chef...it's hit or miss...hello, you can do that in your own kitchen...not worth the money, after the newness wears out, this place will go under...I give it 3 years, there are better options people!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed.  The service was so-so and no one helped us with how to do this.  At previous Mongolian places I had put the sauce in the bowl.  The cook yelled at me for doing this saying it would all cook away (?) He made me get more in the little cup and it ended up so strong I could hardly eat it.  The atmosphere is sorta cold.  Idk...we just didnt care for it much =("}
{"text":"I like the meat and the sauce but the noodle was horrible, it tasted doughy and rawish.  They gave you a large bowl but it's slanted so they only filled half of it. It's overpriced."}
{"text":"Not bad. Quite a bit better than Stir Fry Paradise down the street. The meat was well cooked, vegetables were fresh, and there was a good variety.  However, there are some annoyances. The day we went, the waitress was aggressively pushing the deserts. We had just been shown the table when the desert crap started. Seriously? I haven't even sat down.   I also have a practical complaint. When you get to the sauce area, the damn sneeze guard makes you have to contort a bit in order to get at the sauces in the back. Super annoying, Admittedly, if the sauces I liked weren't in the back, I probably wouldn't care."}
{"text":"I like Mongolian Barbeque and was expecting something like YCs.  Aren't they all the same?  Apparently not.  GG has fresher meats that aren't frozen - plus. Veggies looked like most came from a can or on the dryer side - negative.  Sauces looked about the same - eh.  Then I got to the cooking area and they have rice but no lo mien noodles.  HUH?  They have udon, rice, semolina, and 2 kinds of rice but no lo mien.  Okay seriously how do you say I am so not interested in pursing this further with my bowl full of meat and some measly veggies and sauce.  Did I mention the bows are way smaller than YCs and almost the same price.  I tell myself it's a new place try it.  Well I got rice noodles with my concoction and the end result was okay.  Not because it wasn't flavorful but b/c the meat was cooked too long and the whole dish was super dry even the noodles. Thank goodness I checked in with YELP and got 10% off."}
{"text":"Finally made it in to the Genghis Grill. Glad we did! The food was fantastic and the service the same! Our server was Kara and she was both friendly and extremely helpful. She took us step by step through the creating of our bowls and kept our drinks filled. She suggested the 3G sauce and it was spot on. Had delicious brownies for desert! Will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Went he for lunch and it was not overly crowded (yay!) Our waitress came, took our drink orders, asked about food allergies and (because I'm new to Mongolian BBQ) explained how the process works. Having a recipe chart up on the wall really helped. I went with Beef & Broccoli but was able to add ingredients I enjoy, but aren't normally in this dish. It was fantastic!  I had peach tea to drink and it was very weak in peach flavor. It wasn't sweetened, which for me is a plus. The only negative is the big f-ing gong the cooks beat like an enemy if/when they get a tip. If the gong bothers you don't tip them.  Will definitely be going back again in the future."}
{"text":"Hands down the best service we have had in Vegas in a long time. Food was delicious and the manager and wait staff were fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place for family dinner night. I love how everyone was able to put whatever they wanted on it. Great waiters. The tables were a little dirty from the previous couple sitting down.  Other than that, was a great experience ."}
{"text":"They've done away with their paper table ordering. We heard every table around us ask for it on Monday. Only to hear over and over the new ownership has done away with it. Both myself and my husband had fried rice as our base. There were several clumps of completely white rice in our dish. Several veggies such as onions and celery felt like they hadn't been grilled at all. We really used to like this place but both agreed we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fallen from grace.  Me and my wife used to come to hear all the time for delicious food. It was reasonably priced and always tasted fantastic. Service was exactly what I needed to be, not too much not too little.  It's all changed.  In attempt to confuse and infuriate you there are now  multiple bowl sizes that connects to a rule about not having food at your tray where they try to nickel and dime you. don't worry, you won't forget as there are tons of signs pointing this out about how we will charge you if you even slightly askew from their plan. Gone are the days of just getting a bowl and using engineering skills to build a leaning Tower of food.  As well, they have implemented new, at the table digital check out system. These are great, but because the staff already doesn't have much to do in a self-service restaurant, you've never seen people dig for tips harder in your life. It's actually pretty unfortunate... being friendly is good, continuously interrupting our dinner and attempting to be helpful because you have nothing to do is not.  Sorry, you guys were doing it well for so long but apparently it couldn't last."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in here at 6:15. Not very busy and plenty of servers working. The hostess sat us right away and told us the waitress would be right with us. We sat for almost 10 minutes without being acknowledged and had multiple employees walk past us the whole time. We walked out and are now going to Pei Wei. -1 star for us now smelling like the place for no reason."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, great selection, friendly and accommodating staff.  Glad we tried it - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place with my family thinking it would be like YCs. Boy was I wrong!  I have three major complaints: 1. The meat is not from frozen like at YCs and sits out. This is so disgusting and could seriously make someone ill. What is even worse the whole place smells like fish and makes you nauseated just walking in.  2. The sauces are super thick and sugary. They overpower anything you put in your bowl and ruin your meal. The worst part is that there is no way around this because they are all the same consistency.  3. The fried rice is disgusting. Not only is it too salty, but it has no other flavor.  Needless to say, I will never return here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! The customer service is excellent, and the server directly let us know about what was available to us and made us feel very welcome. The food was also incredibly delicious and at the right levels of spicy!! Supposedly this GG is #8 in the country! Definitely check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love the food here and was pleasantly surprised to see the shrimp is back during dinner. However, the men's bathroom smells like a hot fart on a humid day. It's been at least two years and they haven't bothered to fix it. Use some of the money from raising the prices and fix the plumbing."}
{"text":"I thought it was the worst Mongolian Stir Fry I have ever eaten.  I love Mongolian food.   I was expecting more asian flavor.  It had more like a BBQ flavor.  I didn't care for the service.  I found the servers were trying too hard.  I thought they were extremely annoying.  I do like when they ask if need I something but not everytime I take a bite.  I would never go back mainly because of the service.  I want to be leff alone and enjoy my meal.  Don't try to upsale every single thing on the menu.  It seemed like to me the waiters and waitresses were forced to do this.  If they didn't they would be canned.  I didn't like the atmosphere either.  It was like sports grill/ asian.  Just odd.  Another stupid Corp American type restaurant.  Don't waste your money on this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh meats and vegi's - sauces are to die for; reasonably priced and kids love it.    Watch out for coupons, they have them often."}
{"text":"The Good:  Presentation.  It is hands-on.  As expected in a Mongolian grill, you walk around the station where you can pick your Proteins (Good meats), Spices, Veggies, Sauces.  I felt they had adequate number of choices there.  The quality of selection looked and tasted good.  Once you make your choices, you walk up to the grill where your selection of food combined with your choice of Starch (Rice/Fried Rice/Udon Noodles/Pasta) is cooked on a large grill.  It is fun to sense (both watch and smell) your food while it is being cooked.  Outside of food quality, the place has lot of information to offer you through their large labels/signs posted all around on walls.  Waiting staff is young and friendly.  It is a hands-on dining experience. Do not expect a white glove service.    The Bad: You got to ask for second bowl ($2 additional) if you feel like going for a second time around the food station and have more food cooked for you.  Problem is not with additional $2, but to reach out and ask the waiter for a second bowl.  You don't want any wait times or that wicked you-eat-a-lot smirk on your waiter's face while you are on a food quest like one real Genghis. Do you?"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place, but they have new owners and while they've made some improvements, the manager that's always there is such a jerk! He was super rude to me and my friends on multiple occasions, and said the same thing that he apparently said to anoter reviewer on here. Something along the lines of \"well that's why the other owners went bankrupt, and things are different now.\" The food is still good, but they did increase the drink prices. It just doesn't seem as busy and laid back as it used to be. More of corporate feel now.  We love the concept so we'll probably be back, but miss the previous owners"}
{"text":"A nice, inexpensive place that gives you endless options for combinations of vegetables, sauces and proteins. It's a little dark and dingy so it didn't get five stars"}
{"text":"As far as Genghis Grill goes, food here was subpar. I got Buddha bowl and seems like there was more rice than veggies. The taste was not that great either."}
{"text":"I've come to the conclusion Arizona has no idea what the mongolian experience is supposed to be like.  But this place is the best I've found so far.  basically you pick the ingredients from a buffet style set up, and then they cook it on a huge open range.  Lots of meats, veggies, and spices, and a decent selection for the vegan/vegitarian crowd.  its a little pricy, about 9 bucks for a single bowl and 15 for unlimited trips, but compared to the rest of the mongolian rip offs around town this is the bee's knees.  And for the people concerned about cross contamination, its all cooked after you make your selection so raw meat touching the veggies doesnt really hurt anything."}
{"text":"I ate here a few times in the last two months.  Service is top-shelf, and the food is awesome.  Not sure how the food could ever be a problem, though, as you select your desires from fresh, lean options and flavor your dish according to your own tastes at this place!   What a great experience!  Can't wait to get back!  Nyum, Nyum!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mangolian grill in the valley. I have been there so many times and it takes few times to select appropriate ingredients to get the taste you like. They do have BOGO's some times."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch today. Other reviews are spot on about the process. Service was a little slow, but they were all still quite nice. The place looks clean, and the food was good. Watch how others pack their bowl and do the same. To me, the restaurant felt like a \"do it yourself\" buffet-style version of Pei-Wei. I definitely liked the food.  Some reviews caution about spiciness, but even trying for med-hot my dish wasn't very spicy. You can ask for Sriracha once you get your bowl, though, so that got the heat I was after.   My waitress offered me a to-go cup for my just-refilled soda right as I was about to leave, which I thought was a nice touch. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times over the past 5 years and never had issues. Although the last 3 times the service has continued to get worse and worse leading to the one today.  My fiancé and I thought we would go out for an early dinner. We had three different servers before our food came out, then our food arrives and my bowl is burnt to a crisp. A fourth server comes over and asks how everything is, we tell them that my food os burnt (were not rude as these things happen). She goes to get the manager and one manager comes over and tells me I can go make another bowl and with an attitude tells me he wont charge me for the bowl they burned. As I am getting up another manager comes over and tries blaming me for my food being burned as if it was my fault.  After I re-ordered my bowl, we were then given a 5th server who was actually quite nice and said when he asked management if they were going to do anything for us since they burned my food and my fiancé and I had to eat separately, they said no.  We were not expecting a free meal, discount or anything of the sorts, but the fact that management was so rude and never apologized but rather tried to blame me for my food being burned is beyond me. How management can be so careless and ignorant towards a paying customer and try blaming them for burning their own food is beyond me.   Because of this, we will no longer be eating here."}
{"text":"Visited Genghis Grill for lunch on a Thursday. We had been to a couple other Mongolian grill restaurants elsewhere in the country (loved YC's in Chandler, AZ) and were hoping for something like it to arrive in Charlotte.   We were served promptly and enthusiastically (seemed like the thrill of being a newly opened restaurant motivated the personnel). We were there with my mother-in-law who had never been to a Mongolian grill, so our waitress took us up to the food station and explained the process: You take up the metal bowl you are given, fill it with meat or seafood or tofu, add a bunch of vegies, pick out a sauce (or combo of sauces) and spices, and then take the bowl and sauce dish to the big circular grill and tell them what sort of starch you want (noodles, rice, even tortillas). They grill it up. You can stand and watch or go sit down at your table and they'll bring it to you.   The quality of the meat and vegetables seemed quite good. The meat was not in thinly sliced frozen sheets like it is at other grills I have been to, this meat was in thicker chunks. The sauces were good and there were tasting spoons so you could try them if you wanted. Someone was standing between the two food stations to keep things stocked and clean and to help make suggestions.   I thought the portions were pretty good. Maybe slightly smaller than at YC's, but certainly enough to fill you up. Lunch was $8.99 which seemed fine for what you get. I think dinner was $9.99.  Anyway, I hope the place does well. It was reasonably busy, but not packed, when we were there so there was no long wait. There's also a bar, but we didn't make use of it. They also offer dessert, and our waitress really wanted us to get some, but maybe next time. The atmosphere was comfortable. Nicer than YCs.  I will very likely make it a regular lunch spot."}
{"text":"\"Mongolian Stir-Fry?\" Yeah, okay, this might feel like a gimmick, especially to those who've sampled Mongolian cuisine (anyone? ANYONE?), but Genghis Grill isn't gimmicky, and there's some quality eating to be had there.  For the uninitiated, Genghis Grill can be a bit daunting. First, let's dispense your initial fears: there are no real Mongolians working here, at least none that I could see. And no one working there is a direct descendant of the mighty, ruthless Genghis Khan. Trust me, I asked. Nor is the waitstaff all decked out in pelts and helmets and wielding swords. If you're looking for \"authentic,\" then I'm sure one can catch a flight to Mongolia to experience authentic.   Anyway...  Regarding the \"daunting\" thing: Genghis Grill is a choose-your-own stir fry place. You're given a bowl (quite smallish, really), and one can make their way to the fixings bar (everything is very fresh) and choose from the following: raw proteins (i.e., chicken, steak, pork, fish, tofu, etc.), veggies, seasonings, sauces (more on this later), and starches (i.e., brown/white/fried rice, udon noodles, pasta, etc.). Now if choosing your own foodstuffs is too much of a task for you, not to worry: you can choose from 12 different stir-fry options without the hassle of having to make your own. But then that spoils the fun out of making your own now, doesn't it?  The sauces are GG's secret weapon. With about 10-15 different sauces to choose from - and, don't worry, you're allowed to sample them before you smother your bowl in Dragon Sauce - the sauces are what gives your bowl its' flavor. So choose wisely. Or be like me and just dump about 4-5 sauces into your bowl, and live with the consequences. Note: you're asked to pour your sauces into a tiny side bowl, so please do so.  You then take your bowl to the stir-fry counter, where you're asked to pick a starch - I love their noodles - and, as a nice touch, are asked if you have any allergies. They give you a number, and in about 5-10 minutes time, you've got yourself a yummy bowl. Dig in!  Confused? Don't be. Your hostess will give you the rundown if this is your first visit.   A bowl will run you about $8-$9, but be warned: if you've got a hearty appetite, you can always get seconds for an additional $2.   GG is also kid-friendly: there's a mini-Khan bowl (I think that's what it's called) that'll run you about $3,99, and that inclues a drink. Plus, the guys behind the fry counter will periodically smash a gong (a real one, mind you) just for shits and giggles, which will always give the kids a laugh.  I've eaten at GG twice now, and have been very pleased each time. It's certainly not the kind I'd want to frequent at least once a week. And if you're health-conscious, there are plenty of \"green\" options to choose from, and their website does give you a detailed description of the nutritional value of each bowl.   It does get very crowded at lunch, being it's a short walk from many of Ballantyne's corporate businesses, and it was surprisingly crowded for dinner on a Wednesday night.   So, go on, give it a shot. I just wish they'd have some dude dressed like Genghis Khan stalking the joint, just to mess with everyone. Just a suggestion...  (I've also learned GG is also known as \"Khan's Grill\" in other parts of the country. I could never eat at a place with that name, because I would never resist poking my head at the door and shout, \"KHAAAAAN! KHAAAAAN!\""}
{"text":"Came in around 2pm the place was empty. Which by the way is awesome. Its so much better not to have to rush in the line. The place was clean and very presentable. Service was good I think it was the manager who was making rounds and checking in on someone. Nothing bad to say this time had a great lunch with my family no complaints."}
{"text":"Last night was an epic fail on the service side of things. So apparently Erica (not sure of spelling since she never came back) was near her end of shift and decided to just leave us in a lurch, which meant our drinks were empty the majority of the meal and I had to get a manager to figure out someone to bring our check so we could just get out of there. Thanks for the crappy birthday meal experience."}
{"text":"Not worth it! It's pricey. The selection is not that big of a variety. And they add very little to the bowl even tho you can over flow it!"}
{"text":"This is my girlfriend and my first time here and honestly we have loved it since we came in great customer service and the food smells amazing one of the best places out here no doubt an A++"}
{"text":"My wife and I once in a while treat ourselves to Genghis Grill.  I love the option of picking your food and portion before it is cooked.  You walk in get your bowl and immediately go over and start picking your food to be cooked.  I absolutely love the marinated steak and shrimp.  The chicken is great....Pork is OK.  Veggies are veggies so get what you want.  My wife and now I always get an Egg.....a fried egg really puts the stir fry together...seriously.  After you pick your food pick a sauce(I go with Teriyaki) and you then choose fried rice, Noodles, White rice or tortillas.  My advice get a mix and go with fried rice and noodles.  For you health nuts just go with the fried rice over the white rice...honestly this is probably the healthiest fried rice I have ever had.  My wife can always get a few tortillas for us as well because she asks the cook and they always say yes....What a charmer she is ;)  For good food a beer or two and the ability to watch a game if its on and great people watching this is a fun experience.  Service is usually great....last night ....meh  PS. Dont get the sundae....Its Ice Cream with a little bit of Chocolate sauce on it...just go down to Mojo for that.  Not worth it.  Q"}
{"text":"I love the idea of Genghis Grill and used to go to the Tempe Marketplace location a ton. I love to make my own bowls and I think the quality of the food is really good.   This location was a hot mess though! We went last week and were so disappointed.   Our server explained that his \"boss forgot to renew the liquor license.\"   Ok, I don't know what's worse... forgetting to renew something so important to a restaurant, or having employees who would tell guests something like that. We heard him say the same thing to 2 other tables!  Then we proceeded to watch our server flirt with the hostess while the majority of what seemed like unsupervised staff, jerk around while we waited for our food.  I kind of felt like I was in that movie \"Waiting,\" which made me a little nervous to eat my food lol    I'm sorry to give this place such a bad review, but I feel like I owe it to the owner to let him or her know what's going on. If they could only get it together this place could be awesome!   It has everything you need to make a successful restaurant.. good location, great concept, great food, good prices.  It just seems like the owners have given up.  If they turn things around I would go back."}
{"text":"Food is great as usual.  This is the worst service I have ever had here.  I have been here a few times and it took 15 minutes to get a water.  It took another 15 to get a refill.  There were only 4 other customers in the restaurant but the wait staff was to busy talking to each other wait on us.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great bowls, but they used to be better when they had shrimp, scallops & crab and you could make your own sauce!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door, everything was great!  The staff was friendly and explained everything to us as we were taken to the ingredient station, and the cooks were just as helpful making suggestions before they cooked our food.  Then our server, Katie, brought it to our table and it was delicious!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to eat here, there is a great selection of meats and veggies to create the perfect just for you bowl.  There is also a good selection of starches to go with your meat and veggies. The drink specials are great as well."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great service and perfect ambiance. Robbie, the Manager, was immensely friendly and hospitable. I used to be a YC's frequenter but that is now in the past. If I could give 6 stars I would. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but service is slow!  Yes, I would have dinner here again. They added seafood (crabs, fish) for the choice of meat. Besides chicken and steak."}
{"text":"I love this place food is great, service is great and the manager here is awesome. My girlfriend made her food a Little on the spicy side and they didn't hesitate to help her out and even let her remake what's she order"}
{"text":"Excellent- we enjoyed the drinks, food and service. I just can't believe we've never been here before.  It's on the short list of favorites now!"}
{"text":"I was at this location last night, and everything was right: customer service, amazing; cleanliness, you can eat anywhere here; food, perfect! They have the friendliest staff, and the most awesome food!!  It's located at a very accessible corner when going through Ballantyne.  I'd recommend this place to anyone; they have a bit of anything and everything anyone could want to eat!"}
{"text":"You can't complain about the food here! Because you are the chef! Everything is nice and fresh a lot  of veggies. It's suck if you can't cook, because you have to season it your self. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Not able to customize like at the dine in restaurants but not a bad selection. Big portion. Bests most alternatives at airport fast foods."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The meat was yummy. The staff was super friendly in explaining what to do. A friend and I went in on a Saturday night and were seated right away. My only complaint is that there isn't one closer to me."}
{"text":"I didn't really care for the \"almost yelling\" approach to communication with the staff. The upbeat attitude is good, but to be talked to by everyone like I am 90 years old is over the top. The beer special was great, $1 bottles.  The food was average, it would be nice to know more about the spices and sauces and how much is recccomended. I havent figured out why they hand you a menu and seat you if you are building your own meal in line.  I wont go back, sorry!"}
{"text":"The food is really good. It's fun to build your own bowl. Out server Lindsay was very attentive was a great server. I truly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a Mongolian grill near Surprise, Az; this place is the best.  A wide selection to chose from.  I agree that one bowl is more than enough and you will have food left to take with you.  The server there was wonderful. I will eat here again   *****update*******  I will never eat here again. Ganghis has made lots of changes that have impacted the quality of the food. I loved this place and was eating here at least once a week. I ate here again on 10/28/13 and as you know the food is supposed to be raw and they cook it on the grill for you.  However for some reason they precook the chicken then you are supposed to pile your other raw ingredients on top of it then hand it to one of the grill guys and let the cook it all over again. The chicken was very dry. The restaurant was filthy. The bar with e raw food was plain dirty. The little cups for your sauce were all stained. I kept looking for a clean one and could not find one. Additionally the last few times I have eaten there I have received bowls that contained items I didn't put in my bowl. One example is I don't eat seafood but my bowl had 3 shrimp in it. What if I had a seafood allergy?   Eat here at your own risk! The place needs a good scrub.the tables, menus, silverware, and chairs had left over food particles on them.  I used to visit here every week and I have seen the rapid decline. I don't know what management was thinking... If it wasn't broke then why fix it?"}
{"text":"I returned to genghis after a pretty poor customer service experience the first time. This next round was significantly better, and I am happy I returned. My only gripe was that they had no shrimp, and I was pretty bummed because my mouth was watering for it. The service, though, was my chief complaint the first time and my server was definitely an upgrade. Not outstanding, but an upgrade. Enough so I will be returning."}
{"text":"I have been to several Mongolrian grills, and I was really looking forward to one opening up near me.  So I was happy to hear that Genghis Grill had opened up.  My first experience at this place was nothing to brag about, but nothing to complain about.  The food was good, the service was good, but nothing about this place stood out as real good or great.  Just an average Mongolian Grill.    Nothing about the food or experience left me craving for more."}
{"text":"Great place to have dinner! We have a ritual of coming her every Sunday night for dinner and always request Mike. He's great at his job!!! The food is wonderful but the service we get from Mike makes it that much better. The food selection is like no other and the pricing is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Genghis grill was the only place that I felt comfortable eating at for my gluten allergy. I went tonight eating my food with my dad and I thought I broke my tooth so i immediately spit it out. however when i spit it out it was an inch black screw!!!! I have never been more disappointed and disgusted in my life!! To top it off the manager wanted to cop our meal... like no that isn't enough.. I could've been majorly ill.. Mind you im 16 years old.. so so disgusted..."}
{"text":"Before this trip I had only been to Genghis grill one time and that time had been pretty good. The food was pretty good this time BUT its what happened AFTER that makes me give them one star, actually they should get no star.  I GOT FOOD POISONING FROM EATING AT GENGHIS GRILL. And let me tell you, being violently ill for a day, I could go into detail, about the stomach discomfort, the sweats, the chills, the involuntary emptying of my stomach over and over. And then there was the one time........I wont go into detail. It was just awful. No one should have to go through that.  And my dinner was very costly as it cost me a whole day of work. I could not work, I could only lay on the couch.  And yes I did lose some weight, but what a way to do it!  Hey Genghis Grill, make sure you take better care of all that food that is sitting around. I'm sure I was not the only one who got sick yesterday. But I can sure warn others.  There is NO way I will every eat there again."}
{"text":"I normally love Genghis Grill establishments but not this one :/ it's just the service is very lacking."}
{"text":"My significant other brought me in here because he thought it was something else. I knew by the name that it was going to be mongolian bbq, which I had decided I didn't like based on my ONE experience with YC's. I decided to suck it up and deal with it because I knew he would like it.   I have to say I was quite pleasantly surprised. Not only was the selection of foods better and fresher than YC's, but I really liked the atmosphere much better. We are now regulars here even though it is not close to us at all.  I highly encourage using some of their recommendations the first couple of times so you don't end up crying because you made it too spicy (don't ask me how I know)! Another fun one to try is the fajita combination. You can actually request tortillas, sour cream and cheese and make mini \"fajitas\" out of them. Do keep in mind that this is fast food. The cheese and sour cream are very fast-food-like, but you can really make the meat and veggies worthwhile if you experiment a bit.  Overall, my whole family loves this place. It's nice to be able to make our own creations without the \"asian buffet\" style foods saturated in goopy sauces."}
{"text":"Before I start my review, a matter of full disclosure first: I am the contestant for this Genghis Grill's 2014 Health Kwest, a competition to lose weight over 60 days eating Genghis Grill once a day for each of those days. As part of this competition I do get a free bowl for those 60 days and must complete social media challenges for the possibility to win money at the end of the competition, one of the challenges is to complete a Yelp review. I will try to be as fair handed as possible.  This particular branch of Genghis Grill fell under new ownership a couple of months back and they have done wonderful work to update the look of the restaurant and up the skill of its employees, and it shows. The new bar and dining area are tasteful and the staff is excellent.   Over the past 48 days, I have become acquainted with a number of the staff who know me by name and are always pleasant. Allen, Andrew, and Mike have always been skilled behind the bar and make sure my stays are pleasant and my glass of water is never empty. Arnell and the grill staff are always hard at work and always make sure my bowls are well taken care of and never burned or under-cooked. David, Martika, Hailey, and Edwin have been some of the best servers, making sure my bowls are brought to the table quickly and always greet myself and any guests with a smile and great attitude.  The food here is what you make of it, quite literally. There is a variety of meats from beef and chicken to turkey and calamari. With plenty of seasonings and loads of vegetables the real struggle is to limit yourself so your flavor combination doesn't overpower itself. This is one area of criticism. While some recipe cards are offered at the line, there could definitely be more, showing how versatile a Mongolian stir fry can be. Given the combinations, you aren't limited to just an Asian inspired meal. You can branch out to an Italian pasta dish with pepperoni and red sauce. You can do some outstanding fajitas or even a manly beef and vegetable with barbeque sauce dish. I just wish they had 1) a salad bar and 2) a buffalo sauce so you could make a buffalo chicken and vegetable dish.  My only criticisms are minor and I really enjoy the establishment. And don't let people tell you these places are grossly unhealthy, if you do your bowl right and pay attention, they can be extremely good for you. Even my vegetarian mom loves this place."}
{"text":"not a new concept, but have always had a great meal.  fast, fun and cheaper to go to genghis than buy all the ingredients to make the same meal at home.  we love to go there!"}
{"text":"Barely a meal. I ordered pepper steak BBQ sauce with white rice (forgot exact name). Those \"steak\" are far more like chicken rather than steak. I know that I shouldn't expect great food in an airport, but this restaurant is purely wasting my money and appetite."}
{"text":"I want to say a big thank you to Justin & Robby the managers, and their staff for a perfect evening with my daughter, friends, and family.   My daughter came into town for 1 night and we they made it perfect!!!!"}
{"text":"Really surprised to find this place...the print advertisements that we saw always made our family fee this would be more like Panda Express....totally wrong!!! It was delicious, hot and neat concept. We barely noticed the wait because we were too busy discussing what we were going to make and drinking our cocktails afterwards. Definitely get the Regular sized bowl for best value, yummy to the tummy!"}
{"text":"Gross. Gross. Gross. We felt like we'd entered an alternate reality. First of all, the dining room staff spends several minutes trying to tell you that this will 'be easy'. First clue; this is not the place for me. When I go out to eat, it's because I don't want to cook. Second clue; the staff behind the food bar/prep area are completely uncommunicative. Not sure if they A) Had their personalities shot off in the war or B)Were hired as part of an anger-management half-way house's return to work program. Third Clue: The menu is not a menu. As the dining room staff had indicated, 'it's a guide'. Yah... You're going to want to devote about 30 minutes to studying the menu. Again, this is not the place for you if you don't want to cook today, or are actually hungry and wanting to eat anytime soon. Fourth Clue: The food station is gross. Raw chicken. Sitting in a bucket. Dripping across other buckets of food. Smells bad. At that moment, we decided we weren't just hungry, tired, and cranky; but that our actual health was at risk. So, we left and counted ourselves lucky for the decision to do so. If you decide to visit this place, make sure that your shots are up to date."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this place. The bartender is awesome. He always remembers who we are and exactly want we want to drink. Buuuuut, in the past few months the manager is becoming a tight ass cheapskate. This I know for sure he is going to start losing customers. He just lost this one and all my buddies. I will never come back here again. He said he'd rather loss business than allow people to put a lot of food in their bowl. That's what these places are known for. I'll go elsewhere now to pile my food into a bowl."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. Love the process. Build your bowl, give it to the cooks and go sit and relax. You do not have to stand and wait at the Wok like a goof like other grills. Great selection of meats and veggies as well. Love the sarachi chicken with dragon salt."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Great for a quick, casual meal with friends. Love that I can pile on lot of veggies. That's something that you don't usually get at a restaurant aside from salad."}
{"text":"I love this place, and everyone I've ever introduced it to also loves this place. I also love that they offer different size bowls. I think the few things that I don't really like have been some of their recent changes. Such as you having to go and get your own drinks and use a tablet to order and pay. The waitstaff I hope makes more than a typical waiter or waitress because they don't really have to do anything so I can't imagine they make much in tips. They have started placing workers behind the food to keep everything full and clean. However I will admit that seeing all that open raw meat that people are grabbing themselves with tongs makes me a bit nervous. There's lots of opportunity for cross contamination, and for bacteria to grow on the meats and veggies. My recommendation would be to have the employees dish the meat for you. Other than that, it's been good every time I've gone."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped in for a bite. Clean and friendly. Staff explained how it all worked and the margarita was delicious. Seems family friends and hit the spot."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mongolian bbq so I knew I'd like this place. This is my 4th visit and my first check in. They've changed the menu a few times and added calamari and scallops! Their veggies are fresher and added more condiments and sauces. You can't really give this place a bad review because you create your own flavors. Overall the change in their menu is a positive one, their customer service is pretty good. I'm planning on being a regular! Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Hit Genghis few days ago with gf, and three others.  We were planning a \"wild and crazy\" night of bingo at the Sunset Station since the cash ball bonus was calling my name.  We get to the restaurant at 5:30 - place is busy so we opt to eat in the bar area.  Bingo is at 7 so this gives us sufficient time to go a few rounds , at least that's what we thought.  Bartender was attentive with the drinks, we even got lucky since there was an NFL game on so Happy Hour prices on beer.  Sadly, we get up to the food line and its 10 deep since they only have 1  buffet  line open.  we're told the 2nd line will open soon for the \"dinner rush\" - we're standing in line at about 5:45 - when does the rush begin ?  6?  7 ? Since the place is packed at 5:30 here's a crazy idea - open the 2nd line !!!  So we get through round one - only complaint on food - they were low on a few items and my usual complaint about the place - small bowls.  When we gave the bowl to the cook he asked if we wanted the food to go - we told him no.  So time for second round - it's 6:15 - we figure we have a 1/2 hour to get our food, eat then hit bingo.  This time, the line is about 15 deep - still only one line of food available - WTF !!!  I ask the guy re-filling to ingredients  who's the manager of the place, and he points to a guy manning the grill  - i'll share my concerns with him later.  In the meantime the line is moving at a snails pace.  And of course, i'm mid way filling my bowl when they OPEN THE SECOND LINE - thanks, thanks a lot !!   Given time constraints, when they ask if we want it to go, we say yes.  By the time we get our food, we have 15 minute to pay and leave and get to bingo.  While getting our stuff together, i ask the bartender for our bill - put the $$ with 20% tip in the bill folder even though not pleased about the time issue and the BS of only one line.  The manager comes over to ask how everything went - i expressed my disappointment about the one food line - she advises they open the 2nd line when the place gets busy - THE PLACE WAS BUSY WHEN WE WALKED INTO THE RESTAURANT ... nice try ! She then informs us we cannot take the food to go since we got the bottomless bowl. She had to make the smart remark, It's posted in the restaurant - it might be - i didn't see it nor was i looking - THEN WHY HAVE THE COOK ASK IF WE WANT IT TO GO ?  THEY SHOULD ASK IF WE HAVE THE BOTTOMLESS OPTION, THEN ASK ABOUT TO-GO.  If we can't take it to go then bill us for the one bowl option !  Thankfully she agreed, otherwise, i was really going to lose it .  I get the bill folder and pull out the tip.  F U GENGHIS GRILL - YOU'VE LOST MY BUSINESS"}
{"text":"Ok first, it's airport food...got it.  I'll expect to pay $$ for food and $4 for a drink.  Food was hot and fresh...but I'm sorry, I ordered brown rice vs white rice, oh it gets better.  Took my food to the counter and there were 4 employees that couldn't agree when I asked \"is this brown or white?\" Two guys say brown, 2 guys say white....pretty awesome.  Food was average at best...I'd discourage anyone from patronizing this joint"}
{"text":"This place is good especially for individuals with allergy.  They also have menu for kids just in case they're picky eater.  Staff are very friendly too. They messed up our food but fixed it right away.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Decent service, it had been a long time since I was in a Genghis Grill so I had to ask a few questions on the process.  I was disappointed they didn't volunteer more help, but food was great.  Once the waiter realized I wasn't an expert he recommended sour cream with my food which was great."}
{"text":"Great food! Fresh ingredients! You pick and choose what you want in your bowl! Great low carb options!!"}
{"text":"They choose the noodle amount for you- definitely robbed the value of what we paid. I had the same amount of food my 5 year old had."}
{"text":"Love this place but if you get there after 12 on a week day be prepared for a large crowd. it is a little different than the Mongolian BBQ places we have been to out west but it is a great lunch alternative in Charlotte and you will not walk away feeling hungry thats for sure."}
{"text":"Very unique atmosphere love the idea of creating your own stir fru, I love that I can choose my food and not be picky per snicktie  on what I love in my stir fry jalapeños onions bell peppers chicken and siracha brown rice, I love my options  I need the siracha chicken was best texture and flavor I have tasted in my option the spicy flavor came after which was ok, the staff was friendly and well mannered clean environment  Thank you very much excellent great delicious food"}
{"text":"Great idea for a restaurant. I love making my own bowl and then getting the free fried egg on top. Only thing I would change is they have a full menu almost but you have to ask for it. If you have allergies make sure to tell the server they take extra care of you."}
{"text":"The first time I went there is was a 5 star experience. Every time after that the stars just kept falling off. They stopped the scallops , shrimp, marinated beef, and replaced them with three kinds of tasteless fish, two super tough, chewy beef, and turkey, really?, what, no stuffing? Grrr, I will call before next time, no seafood, no go! Another bad experience and I will put my free bowl on ebay where everyone gets rid of their junk."}
{"text":"This place has a unique concept: create your own meal. I guess if you are creative, go head and give this place a try. If you don't like what you're eating then you can't blame anyone else because you're the individual that created the dish.  So if you're confused about what I'm writing about, this restaurant is a create your own entree place. You are basically your own chef. You pick your meats, veggies, side items, seasoning, etc. and hope that what you picked out will end up looking (and tasting) appetizing.   This restaurant is categorized as Mongolian, but I don't think what I created was Mongolian-like. lol. I really wished they had a separate menu on the side for those that are indecisive and would rather pick something truly Mongolian. :)  My tip is don't be afraid to had lots of meats and seasoning. I regret this because mine was light on the meat side, and it tasted super bland.   I would recommend this place if you're tired of ordering from a menu and would like to test the waters with new and inventive dishes."}
{"text":"I love this spot! Me and my friends enjoy coming here, the service is great and the food is satisfying. Very fulfilling. Udon is my favorite! We always stack our food by putting veggies in the bottom and meat on top."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place! This tempe location always has great drink specials and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Being a fan of Mongolian food I was curious about what this place had to offer. First time there was on a Sunday and the place was extremely packed and it took forever for the food to come out. Went in to dine there but because of the long wait got it to go instead and the waitress made a price change on bill which ended up being lesser than what it should have been due to wait. That was appreciated. The food was great when I got home to eat it so I went back the next day when it was not as busy and ate there and was completely satisfied with the food and service! Great place for healthy fresh food."}
{"text":"I definitely did not like this place! I found it odd that it's ok to put your raw meat into a bowl, then go to the vegi area and mash your vegis into the raw meat and place the spoon you used, that now has raw meat juices on it ,  back into the  community vegi  bowl. I don't eat chicken.  The thought of someone's chicken juice, laden spoon being put back into the broccoli  grosses me out!!  It's very overwhelming. There are too many choices. I swear I got twinges in my stomach after I ate there."}
{"text":"I ate here last year & forgot just how much I love this place! You create your own dish however you like. Select your type of meat from chicken to crab to beef to turkey or more. Select whatever veggie you like including some fruits. Choose your seasoning/s & sauce/s then your choice of carbs (noodles, rice, etc). Pile it up as high as you like! Pass it on to the chef & they make it for you & have it served to you at your table. You can def end up making 2 meals out of your one meal you've made. The food is so delicious! You can actually order your food from your table as well via their mini IPads.   This is def a place you have to check out as it is alot of bang for your buck, healthy as much as you like it, & VERY tasty & if it's not well guess you should remove some items for next time since you're the creator. Too bad there isn't one closer to where I live"}
{"text":"Can't go to Vegas without visiting this place at least once, my girlfriend won't allow it lol!  Great food, cool concept!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here, you can make your own stuff, combination, veggies and stuff.  delicious! the FOOD is great,  The service however, could be better, faster and more attentive.  Ronney"}
{"text":"My first time here, I was invited by a friend who had eaten here before and said the food was good. The concept was nice and my food was ok. My friend however was feeling sick from the little she had eaten and decided that she wasn't going to continue to eat her food as it was making her stomach feel nad each time she would eat some. She mentioned it to the waiter and he just said ok and brought the bill without even offering her something else or to remove her meal since she barely touched it. She asked for her meal to be taken off the bill, but the waiter said all the manager was willing to do is take 50% off. I think it might have been the raw chicken that she choose to be cooked with her meal. Raw chicken shouldn't be sitting outside the refrigerator for too long even if it is on ice. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"*This review does not reflect the great service I got by my waitress Jen*  Please excuse the vulgarity of this review**   By no means is this place a mongolian bbq, or should even have the word mongolian in its title. What a disgrace to the mongolian people. All the bad reviews on yelp nail this one. You put your gross tasting meats in your itty bitty bowl, pick from a selection of terrible veggie combinations then add goopy, thick, slimy sauces that make no sense on why anyone would ever consume such a thing. After taking a few bites and being unsatisfied we desided to let the manager know how gross it is, in a polite way, and she tells us if we come back we can make fajitas from their odd variety next time. Yes, because when I think of mongolian, I think of fajitas..?.. i think I just died a lil inside.  Not only save your money, but save your time and life, go across to arbys and eat atleast 20 beef sandwiches and I doubt the stomach ache from that wont add up to the stomach ache youll get from a few bites of this place.you know a place is bad you have the immediate urge to take a scolding hot shower shortly after eating. I feel dirty :("}
{"text":"I was very disappointed when I visited Genghis Grill on 10/25/2015.  My family and I have had many a great experience at this restaurant.  The concept was unique and interactive.  We enjoyed coming here and trying out different recipes using different meats and veggies.    Today we learned that they no longer offer the endless bowl.  Meaning you now get only one bowl (small, regular, or large) and can only make one trip through the food bar.  So make it a good one, because there is no going back.  I know what your thinking, what good is a Mongolian buffet without the buffet?  We really enjoyed getting the small bowls and making multiple trips to the grill, trying out different flavor combinations and using different proteins and veggies.  We didn't care about the up-charge for the endless bowl.  To us, it was well worth it.  The endless bowl was part of the charm of this type of concept restaurant.  Throwing out the endless bowl feature really takes this restaurant down a number of pegs in my eyes.  I doubt we will be going back anytime soon.    They now have a set bowl price, $9.75 for small bowl, $12 for a regular, and $14.75 for a large.    Another thing that disappointed us is that we had our son with us this trip, celebrating his birthday.  In the past, they would have a brownie desert for anyone with a birthday, and they would sing the Mongo's birthday song.  Well, they don't do that anymore.  So no more special birthday dinners here.    The waitress told us that all these changes are because the restaurant is transitioning from a franchise to corporate owned.  If this is how the corporation wishes to run it's restaurants, I feel sorry for them, because they seem to have forgotten what made Genghis Grill a unique spot for dining."}
{"text":"Lot of fun. My kids enjoy coming here with me and putting together their own dish. Little challenging getting the sauces / flavors right but still fun and good."}
{"text":"It was alright.  Quick preparation. Above average taste however over priced compares to other choices in the airport"}
{"text":"Went to eat at Genghis this last Tuesday after taking a 2 weeks vacations oversees. I love your restaurant so much that I craved your food for the entire 2 weeks!  Love your food, love your service, love your concept! Love your new menus!!! Keep on going! You are doing a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"Went here for date night and had a blast!!! They have many different options of things to put in your bowl, and even some recipes if you don't feel comfortable free styling it!! There are a couple of additional ingredients I would have loved to see but I'm not even going to mention them because I don't want anything to come off bad about this place!!!  What's even better is that on the table they have a small monitor that had some funny date night games. This place is a must try for everyone"}
{"text":"*Completely Ignore my 1st review*  Read this one instead.   A month ago, the new owner reached out to me to apologize for the bad experience my friend and I had earlier. As a nice gesture, he offered me 2 free bowls, 2 drinks, an appetizer, and a dessert on my next visit  Tonight, my friend (the same one from before) came with me for dinner. What a difference changes in ownership can do for a restaurant.   I went to use the bathroom, and it was pretty clean, unlike the last time. Our server, Tyler, was very attentive despite the fact that our meal was completely comped. (I made sure to tip him for our meal).  We ordered the pot stickers as our appetizer which were pretty good. I didn't care too much for the dipping sauce that came with it, but the stuffing in the pot stickers was delicious.   They still offer raw calamari which made my heart sing. In addition to the calamari, they offered scallops, too. Woooooot. You could tell they were fresh and definitely not cheap. The cook cooked my bowl perfectly. Cooking calamari correctly is a skill that not too many people have.   The night manager came to check on us a couple of times...I thought that was very considerate. He also offered up a 2nd comped dessert which he certainly didn't have to do. On his recommendation, we both ordered this coconut pineapple cake with white chocolate drizzled on top. *YUM*  I'm definitely going back for lunch or dinner, for sure!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a weekday afternoon when we discovered the restaurant we'd planned on was closed. It was my husband and our 2 kids aged 3&5. Everyone was very kind and the food was great. I love Mongolian grills and the kids always enjoy watching their food cook. It was a hit for us and we'll be back. The drink selection could be better...all soda and sugary yuck. Other than that, a great little spot."}
{"text":"Both the food and the service have gone down in the last few months.  YC's in a better option than this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! When you have that hunger that nothing seems to satisfy come here. At Genghis Grill you create your own bowl and are the architect of your entire meal. You can decide between 10 or so different types of meat, then go on to season them accordingly. After you move on to the vegetables and believe me you want to stack them as high as you can. Finally they offer you about 15 different choices of sauces as well as a few different starches such as rice, noodles etc. The bowls come out steaming hot and delicious. For those who are more bold they offer an endless bowl in which you can go up and refill as many times as you want. Overall this place is awesome, both food and service are excellent."}
{"text":"I like the food and some of the wait staff are great I will go back and I do send friends there"}
{"text":"One extra star for being the only #vegan place in airport I could find. Ordered udon noodles and got brown rice. Maybe the angels guiding me. Spicey hot made to order. Fresh veggies. Sad BBQ place next to it. Near entrance to B in the main area. vegan"}
{"text":"I was contacted by the NEW manager to give them another chance so I did. I was pleasantly surprised. Our server was attentive, answered our questions and definitely made our visit pleasant.  The concept of Genghis Grill is Mongolian. I think anyone's first visit will be daunting but the staff will walk you through it. I think the trick is to make your own bowl vs having them make it.  For dessert I got the brownies and oh em gee, they were wonderful! If you're not willing to get up and put a little effort into preparing your meal then this isn't for you but it's worth it to try all the different spices, sauces and salts."}
{"text":"Love this place. I was always a fan of YC's. This place is kind of the same concept with way better ingredients to add to your bowl. Not only does it seem much fresher there is a lot more to choose from. The drinks are also really good with some long pours."}
{"text":"Well... My husband and I love this place. Our server, Robin was the best!  Friendly, courteous and helpful. The cook accidentally gave me the wrong noodles, so the manager, Bill.. Was Fantastic!!!! He gave my meal to go...and had me make another one and actually cooked it himself. Love it!!  Very customer service oriented. We will be back"}
{"text":"I came to eat here with my boyfriend and everything was great! Clean restaurant and friendly staff! We sat at the bar! Our bartender was super friendly and attentive! He had great suggestions for yummy drinks!! We shared a large bowl and it was delicious! We will be returning here ASAP!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Genghis in 6+ years & never to this location but it had changed things up from what I remember for sure. Not knowing how spicy their spicy was I went balls out. Boy howdy if I were a cartoon I would have had steam coming from my ears for sure. But luckily I'm not a cartoon so nobody knew how insanely hot I had gone on my bowl. Because of my master skills at Mongolian BBQ flavors I couldn't stop eating it & made it through a giant dinner bowl.  I will be back & keep my spicy hand on a leash so I can really, really enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is average. It is probably the only option in the area if you happen to be craving mongolian grill style food. They took away the kids eat free on Tuesdays which is a big disappointment. They do have those new soda machines which can make over 100 drinks which is a plus."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! You can customize your bowl to what you're really craving that day. I suggest getting the regular bowl, large if you want a small leftover for lunch the next day. The severs are all very pleasant and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Upscale version of YCs.  Better seasonings and sauces available (Yay for Curry!).  As a vegetarian it is harder to pack all the veggies in your TINY bowl here as compared to YCs though. The drink specials are AWESOME!"}
{"text":"This place seems to get worse and worse everytime we come here. Coke machines are never stocked. The place always understaffed so wait time continues be awful. They have an amazing selection of food but are always out and limits your selections. I recently came here again on a date this time they were out of everything. The only thing they had in stock for once was the soda fountains. Pasta came back cold. Good bowls were mixed up. Waiters are very nice though if you like the company I guess. Only really good thing I can say now. Restraunt used to be great, but it's sad to see it go downhill. Won't be coming here again. Save your money and go to the sushi place next door. Haven't tried it yet, but looks cool."}
{"text":"Genghis grill has always been an all time favorite for me! I went there about 2 years ago and always wanted more!!! Only reason why this rating is 4 stars is because once and awhile when I order udon noodles or rice I got something different but they've ALWAYS taken the courtesy to change it"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and I LOVE IT. You get to pick everything you want in your bowl, from your meats, to your veggies, to adding seasonings, to creating your own sauce, and then picking what kind of rice or noodles you want. It is a little pricy, but it's sooo delicious that it's worth it! Both times I have not only had yummy food, but I have been shown great customer service."}
{"text":"Food was great and the waitresses was helpful and on piont!"}
{"text":"A non-holiday, regular Saturday night. Drove 20 miles one-way (actually thought it was closer than that) for take out. Get there over 20 minutes before they were SUPPOSED to close according to their website and the hours shown on their door (pictured). But OHHHHHHHH NO! - CLOSED. I've been to Genghis Grill in Tucson and the food is awesome! So, this review/location gets 2 \"legacy\" stars based on my previous experiences."}
{"text":"Live in Cali and visit my grandparents all the time here in vegas and Always come here. My only issue with this place is 1. There isn't many of these! I'm pissed because this place is amazing and there is nothing like this back out in Cali. And 2. They got rid of their POS systems which as you sit down and eat, the cool thing about them is you can play games on it while you wait for the food to be cooked and not only that, you can pay with it and seperate the check by meals and such.. however you want it. They need to put that back, I think that was a great idea but one of the ladies told me no one liked it.. I don't know why. Love this place, will always be back for more!!! Amazing food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick stop for a nice lunch. I enjoy the do-it yourself bowls and they just have so many selections you can choose from, whether it's for the meat, toppings or sauce.   I made a small cajun-chicken bowl w/mushrooms, a bunch of spices and udon noodles which was very good. You can order a drink before you go make your bowl which makes it convenient when you come back and wait for your bowl- that way you don't waste any time if you're in a rush. Their service was also great! We had many servers asking us numerous times if our food was ok or if we needed anything else.   The only reason why I am not giving them 5 stars is because my fork was not clean at all, but I didn't mind since I eat with chopsticks anyway, but my friend's fork was also dirty and he had to ask for a new one."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet for this one...  1) Be very careful of all the raw meats being SO close together! I think I saw some people only using one tong for all the meats... eee!  2) It's hard to gauge how much spices/powders you put into your bowl... so be careful. Sometimes less is more.  Service is alright - you build your own plate, they cook it and then they bring it to your table, don't expect much but have fun with it, I guess."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food.It didn't taste good to me. The noodles were starchy and my order was swapped with another gentleman. There was not enough flavors to their stir fry.However I did like their dumplings with some hot sauce, the only saving grace."}
{"text":"The food is still amazing but the new system sucks, they nickel and dime you for everything and is super confusing. Basically to get the same thing you got before for $10 you pay $15. All of the employees said every customer hates it but the new CEO changed things. I may eat here again if I am at the movie theatre next door but I sure am not going out of my way anymore."}
{"text":"What I like:  -The meat isn't frozen, that's nice.  -There is a lot to choose from.  -The bowls they serve in are nice; I need some for my own house. - They have a happy hour, and the waitresses are cute.  What I don't like: -It could be me, but I always feel rushed here.  - I can't figure out of it's a sports bar with a dining alternative, or if it's a restaurant with a sports bar fetish... -The man who want to know if I want rice or noodles doesn't speak to me.. he points. (Come on, let's use our words on this one.)   Verdict:  I am not a big fan of this place, but it really isn't a bad place either. I am very bifurcated. Part of me wants to give this sports bar a 4, but then the rest of me wants to give this franchise eatery a 3.  If only they had beer - wait, they do."}
{"text":"Genghis Grill is an ok place. The place is nice and like the idea of being able to customize your bowl the way you want. They give you so many meats, sauces, seasonings and vegetables to choose from you'll never run out of creative ways to make your bowl. Plus for the lazy person, they have bowls already created so you don't have to decide if choice is hard for ya lol. The biggest drawback is PRICE!! Average $10 for a bowl. The scary part is you can pile up so much ingredients and have it overflowing with goodness and BOOM!! When its cooked your bowl has shrunk lol. I was like what the hell? Did they drop half my food on the floor? Especially for the money. If your craving Mongolian, you can find better deals elsewhere. At the Fiesta Henderson Buffet, they have a mongolian section and you can customize your plate anyway you want for half the price and as the Fat Boys Song says, \"All You Can\" Eat!!\" Until next time, Let's Eat!!!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time back with my husband and kids and I must say that every visit has been such a pleasure. Our server Taylor is the reason we keep returning. The food speaks for itself great taste great quality but your dining experience relies on the customer service. When your waiter or waitress not only knows you by name but can remember what you like to eat and what appetizers you previously tried that is what going above and beyond stands for. I love the dining experience and atmosphere . Tonight I got to enjoy football great prices and felt like I was fine dining . I truly hope someone recognizes when your staff goes above and beyond excellence to ensure the customers are given a great dining experience . From the attentiveness to the hot meal you created this place feels like home. Just an fyi I did read a previous statement by a customers complaining about Taylor and I beg to differ.. If the staff asks if you have been there before it's because they want to ensure that your experience will be a memorable one. When your waiter asks if everything is alright or do you enjoy the food it's because they really want your opinion to make sure you are enjoying what you are paying for . Seems to me like this girl should have stayed home . Overall u get your money's worth your kids are entertained with the games a great place to take your family for a healty dinner .. Please ask for Taylor to serve you she will bring a smile to your face"}
{"text":"I think this is a great place. I like the whole concept behind it. Pick out what you want and can cram into a bowl and they cook it up for you. So many different combinations. Yes. Sometimes the food line can get a little messy if they are busy. This location seems to do a good job of keeping it clean and tidy. It is pretty easy. They give you your bowl when they seat you then you go to the food line and pick out everything you want. They also have recipes if you just can't decide what would go good together. Start out with the meat. They have steak, pork, chicken, sausage, crab, etc. Then you move on to spices and whatever veggies you want. You finish up with sauces. All different kinds. They have little metal cups for the sauces and you can get as much as you want of everything. You take your bowl and sauces over to the cooks and let them know what kind of starch you would like. They have several different kinds, udon noddles, white rice, fried rice, egg noddles and a few others. They give you a number and you go back to your table and put the card in the holder. When your bowl is done they bring it right to your table. They do provide forks if you just can't handle chopsticks. They also have a few apps like edamame and potstickers.  I love potstickers and theirs are pretty good. They also have $1 domestic beers. Tough to beat that. This may not be the best place in the world but it is pretty good. It is kind of your own fault if it is not good since you put it together but there is the possibility the ingredients were not fresh or something. But every time that I have been here there has never been a problem. I will continue to go back once in a while."}
{"text":"very nice..used to go to BD Mongolian all the time...but none in Vegas. *Womp Womp\" Me and the wife tried Genghis Grill. Just like what I was used to. Food turned out good. At the time I wasn't impressed with the service. However I was told later the delays were related to a fund raiser for a school that was taking place. So I will have to go back soon. Food was good!! $3 more for unlimited eats!!!"}
{"text":"The food quality was excellent as usual. I like Genghis SO much better than YC's because of the freshness of the meat.  At YC's it's always frozen.  While it's kind of gross to see raw meat out, it is always kept cold and is much better than the frozen meats at YCs.  This restaurant hasn't been in this location very long. It used to be a My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. I am glad to see that there is a Genghis Grill close to my location. However in this new location, it seems that they need to improve on some things. The atmosphere wasn't great nor did it do anything great for the experience.  They have several flat screen tv's and the music was quite loud.  It was almost too loud for a restaurant atmosphere.  There was a considerable wait for the server to come with our beverages and then consistently over the course of our meal, our server was rarely seen and quite slow.   After we received our beverages but before we went through the line, we saw a large roach crawling on the floor next to our table.  My husband told another server who took care of the problem and then told the manager. It took a little while for me to get my appetite back but once I did we proceeded quickly through the line.  The line, again had great food albeit a bit messy and the handles on the spoons for serving the food were sticky.  After our meal, it took a very long time to get the check. We first requested it from the manager and then from another server than our own and then finally from the manager again.  It was almost 15 minutes before we received it.  While the food was good, I was disappointed with the service and atmosphere.  I really like Genghis and want it to be good.  The location at Tempe Marketplace is better for cleanliness and service."}
{"text":"Whenever my Wife and I can't decide on where to go for lunch, we go to Genghis Grill, because it is like no other place around here. You know what you're eating as you fill up your bowl, and our waiter John is a \"ROCKSTAR\". This awesome guy always has a smile on his face, and a 'can do' attitude, as in \"what else can I do for you\" We love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so fun to make your own bowl and then watch it get cooked!  It's the best to get the udon noodles and tortillas! Mmmmm!  The staff here was always awesome.  I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Our food was so good and fun to make! It's refreshing to go somewhere and be able to make your food just how you want it. Our server Caroline was very attentive and very lively. She made it very comfortable atmosphere I would 100% go back and eat there again and would definitely recommend it to my friends !!!!!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of variety on the line. I selected shrimp, veggies, brown rice and a spicy ginger sauce. This is my first time here and the staff were patient in explaining the jig. The price was 13.49, for a medium bowl - however it looked very small to me and when I did get my meal it looked so small. Now I understand the seasoned customer in front of me who packed her veggies and meats with her fingers. Initially I was annoyed by her taking so long, now, I completely understand. The staff cooked my meal but I will take credit for putting it together. If I come back but will pack my food into my silver bowl like she did. I was there for lunch, music was too loud and just made me feel anxious so I left. I couldn't eat my food comfortably."}
{"text":"O M G!!! This place is my new favorite. For $15, I ate probably 3 pounds of deliciousness! From the moment I entered this place to the moment I left, I was impressed. I had multiple employees help me with the process and ask me how my meal was. You have so many options, it was nice to get advice from the employees. I will be back again and again and again!!!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed.  I went with my husband and our 5 year old daughter before we went to see a movie, at first i was pleased, the hostess handed us a tiny bowl for our daughter and seated us right away.  from there it was horrible.  She tossed a menu down on the table and walked away, and me being used to Mongolian like at YC's this was way different.  I had to stop another employee to ask what we were supposed to do. he waved us over to the line where the food was and walked off.  I walked up and saw all the choices for meat, it didn't look like they kept it cold enough so i steered clear of any seafood and anything not marinated.  The vegetables mostly looked canned except for the mushrooms and the carrots.  The guys at the grill weren't happy to be there and they made no point of hiding that fact, they just pointed at our choices (rice, brown rice, udon noodles, or SERIOUSLY spiral macaroni) and grunted something, he handed us three cards and sent us off, by the time we got back to our table they had seated someone else at our table.  I was so upset I almost walked out at this point, but we didn't have time for anything else before the movie.  I would definitely NOT recommend this to ANYONE, all the food tasted horrible, go to YC's instead."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so I'm never really all that excited about chains.  But it's good for what it is.  The service is always prompt, friendly and not overbearing.  As for the food, it's the usual Mongolian BBQ type set up, you fill your bowl with protein and veggies and then hand that off to the guys cooking on the grill, and tell them what starch you want to add.  Nothing fancy, but you can get a good meal, and if you're trying to eat healthy, you can do it pretty easily here if that's your bag. It's about $10 a person, so not a great deal, but not too pricey either."}
{"text":"Why 2 stars? Because it's one of the worst meals I've had in a long time.     ---   ---   ---  I used to eat at a local Mongolian grill very often in high school, and I was pretty excited to be reunited with one during my layover in Charlotte.  I can excuse the fact that my order was forgotten, and I had to wait much longer than everyone else around me... mistakes happen. What I cannot understand is how they can, in good conscience, serve the Mongo BBQ bowl. Honestly, it's one of the worst tasting things I have had in a very long time.  I can't imagine the President of Genghis Grill visiting this location, tasting this dish, and saying, \"yep... that's the Genghis way!\"  I mean, it was just awful. Even if I don't like something, I usually end up finishing the whole thing, because I'm a human garbage can... but I couldn't stomach finishing this."}
{"text":"This place is seriously one of my favorite places to eat. The staff is always friendly and talkative. The mongolian bbq sauce is easily the best thing about their food. I just wish I were a little thinner and wealthier so I could eat it more often."}
{"text":"Food is good but you can't really give that to them since you decide what it tastes like based on what you pick.   The prices to serving sizes here are a total joke. Ordered a small, 11.88 after tax, plus this is a service restaurant so add tip (or don't). I just finished my meal, I'm out 12.88 and still hungry as hell. A large will set you back 15$ and isn't as big as YCs small that only cost 8.95. Plus you get free soft serve at YC! Won't be back"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in over a year and decided to try it again. Unfortunately it failed because of cleanliness. When we walked in we noticed a lot of dirt on the floor. The bar area floor was very dirty.  This was at 11:30 on a Sunday morning so obviously left over from the night before. The booth they tried to seat us at had dirt and food on the seats and table which we asked them to clean before we sat down.  When we went to get food the entire area was dirty and based on the number of customers in the restaurant looked like it had been left from the night before. The cooler doors on the inside of the food area had drips of food all over them. This is just a mass case of food poisoning waiting to happen. Bathrooms floors were nasty. The sink was falling off the wall. The plastic trash bag inside the feminine product disposal was so large it touched you when you used the toilet. The health department needs to visit"}
{"text":"Great food for an airport. The concept is a fixed menu of 8-10 \"bowls\" with a choice of meat, veg (including veggie), starch (brown rice, white rice, noodles), and styles (eg teriyaki, korean, mongolian) . You order, pay your $8-10, then they cook it right in front of you. So you get FRESH food for about what you would pay for steamtable fare anywhere else.  Plus it's actually good ! We need more of these in more airports.  Together with the sushi joint right next door, this makes the Charlotte Airport  a really nice place to transfer thru. Very strong work."}
{"text":"Nice to have a vegetarian option (other than salad) when traveling.  Ordered the Bhuda Bowl.  Not totally a fan of the mix of vegetables (green beans, but no onions?) but it was still tasty over the noodles with a Siracha sauce and a bit of soy sauce on it.    Asahi beer?  Yes please.    Order taker was very friendly.  Food was quick."}
{"text":"We asked for something off menu and voila out it came--chicken philly--so good, hot, perfectly grilled vegetables. French fries crispy and seasoned well. Not a fan of the special sauce, but it was on the side. I'd come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely gives me hope that Mongolian Grill restaurants can still dish out great food. This restaurant in particular is on point with the service and attitude and the food and ingredients are amazing."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised and I trigger moreso than I expected. It's a step above Mongolian BBQ that I've had in the past. The selections are quite vast and the wide array of vegetables are super fresh. It's a yummy yet healthy option and filling for 10.99. $3 more and your bowl is bottomless but honestly I eat a ton and one bowl is good enough.   Pile the veggies up high and don't be shy; they do cook down!"}
{"text":"Just okay for my taste, the one thing I do like is that you can go crazy with what you decide you want to have them cook up for ya!!  You simply, pick your choice of meat, choice of seasoning, veggies, sauce and starch and you hand it over to the cook, that then they heat it up for you in their gigantic grill and TA DA, it is all ready for you to enjoy!! The one thing that I honestly don't really like is the price, it could definitely be adjusted, it is a bit over-priced for the portioned you get and that is without a drink, if they included your drink of choice then I would then be content!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. When you enter, they ask if you've been there before and if not a waiter takes you to the line and explains it to you. Its a different process for a sit down place. We chose our size bowl, piled on veggies and meat and chose what sauce we wanted, and there's quite a few choices for each section, thats nice. Bring it to the cooks and asked if we wanted an egg and either rice, noodles, or half and half. The noodles weren't like regular mongolian noodles you usually get from these types of places, they were like udon noodles, i think, which was weird to me. They cook it and then the waiter brings it to your table. It was not bad, but also not great. It was hella pricey though. For a medium bowl it was like 10-11$ for dinner. I never pay that much for mongolian noodles esp for that amount of food. The waitress we had was super nice and always checked up on us so the service overall at the place was great. It wasn't busy when we went during a weekday, and there's plenty of room, it's quite big actually with large tvs hanging around. Booths or tables available. Would only come back if i was really craving some noodles real quick bc it's nearby."}
{"text":"Things have changed at this location, I usually enjoy shrimp , crab and calamari and they had none of that. I will not visit this location again when visiting Scottsdale like we usually do."}
{"text":"This place looks like it should get four or five stars. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver a four or five star experience.  We went there on a Sunday for lunch. We walked in and just managed to get in the door. There were several people in front of us waiting for a table. The hostess seated everyone fairly quick. We were taken to be seated at a table, but doing so would have put us shoulder-to-shoulder and elbow-to-elbow with the people at the tables next to us. The inside, at least for me, felt claustrophobic. (I don't think I've been anywhere that felt this way before.) We decided instead to sit at the bar.  We took a seat at the bar. The bar is small. Maybe a little bigger than what someone might have in their home. We were promptly greeted by the bartender. She took our drink order and gave us a quick run down of how to get our food. There is a menu  but you have to go to almost the last page to get bowl sizes and price.  You have a couple options to get your food. One is to fill out a small card with your name, bowl size and if you want noodles, rice or cabbage added to what you already put in your bowl. This you take with you, get in line, fill your bowl with your choices and present it at the end to the cooks. Or, you can fill out a larger card that lists all your options for ingredients, check off what you want and hand it to your server to take up for you. As a third option, there are twelve dishes listed with ingredients if you prefer to not have to wing it.  We decided to make our own. Line was short and moved quickly. First station you pick your meat. Although shrimp is still on the menu, they are no longer serving it due to cost. I picked the lime garlic fish instead. Next is seasoning, after that veggies and last is sauces. You can also add an egg at the end. Then mark if you want noodles, rice or cabbage and off it goes to be cooked. There are a lot of choices. It's a bit overwhelming at first.   We went back and sat down. Our food was done fairly quick. The food looked good, but somehow I think my fish got lost. At first I thought it may have flaked apart, but I never even found flakes of it. Quite disappointing! First no shrimp, even though still on the menu, and then my fish was completely left out.  By the time we finished, the line for a bowl had become increasingly longer. The odd thing is that the line itself cuts right through the middle of the restaurant and towards the front door, further lending to the small claustrophobic feel.   Service was good, food just okay, atmosphere was close and too small.  Two stars."}
{"text":"Not bad. Remember YC's being better."}
{"text":"I'm not a \"yelper\" at all but I am a server in a fine dining steakhouse on the strip so I know and appreciate good service when I get it and I always get it here. My Son and I make the drive across town for the food and have become regulars bcuz of how amazing it is. We've taken a liking to Tayler as she is always sweet and welcoming and goes out of her way to chat with my son about his baseball games, she's efficient and always makes sure we have everything we need. The time or two we didn't sit with her she made it a point to stop by and say hello. Amazing food..Amazing staff! Pineapple cake a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this location, and the workers were very friendly and inviting. Food was good, I wouldn't given it a 5 star but I asked for for fried rice instead of steam rice, but in all it was still good"}
{"text":"For a stir fry \"your way\", Genghis is the way to go! Good, fresh, quality ingredients to make your lunch or dinner exactly the way you want it! Great service also!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!  The food and sauce choices are expansive and the guides to creating a delicious meal are great. The concept is different than whats offered in Ballantyne and the staff is patient to give customers a tutorial in how to make a great meal. Be fun, be creative and try some new combos because you cannot go wrong! Improvements can definitely be made for the service. Often when I go, my water glass is empty and the servers seem disinterested to take care of their tables. It's one of those rare places where I'll still go because the food is delish, hence why I still give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant, we have gone there for years, starting in early 2000 in the Plano TX location, and through all the different changes they've tried it's still been my favorite. Today we went and it's the first time that I sincerely think we will never go back.  They changed their food service, they have 3 different sizes to choose from. Small, medium, large. The medium is the old style dish. We decided to try the large, it's barely larger then the medium bowl and it's $2 more. They no longer have all you can eat, we were told you can pay $5 to go back up. So now you pay more to eat less. I overheard the manager tell people these changes were for better customer service, to give ppl more options. No one but kids will eat the small, so who were the options for if you used to just be able to pay $2 extra for all you can eat? It's not for the customer experience, it's corporate greed at its finest.  Then they now give you paper cards to carry with you as you feel your bowl, to hand to the griller's. What am I supposed to do with the paper card while I'm trying to use both hands to hold my bowl and reach under sneeze guard for food to put in my bowl? Bad ideas, did anyone ever try these ideas out before implementation? Extremely disappointed that corporate greed to increase profits year over year is ruining this restaurant the same way it's ruined so many over the years."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go when at work and have time for a lunch the dragon sauce is delicious and I love the edamame they serve. I don't stray on the sauce it's sweet and spicy never had bad service I go almost every week or every other week"}
{"text":"If you've never been here, you've got to go! You make your own bowl and it's cooked for you so you get to choose everything that goes into it down to the spices. Prices aren't bad at all, especially considering how much food you get."}
{"text":"Last Friday night my husband and I were able to try this place.  We say we want to eat there every time we go to the movies.  Well unfortunately,  IT WAS AWFUL...The counter where you make your meal was disgustingly dirty, my rice was watery and when I got my meal it looked like a bowl of mush....something you would feed a bunch of chickens. I had chosen a ton of veggies and fish,  well they destroyed it during the cooking process.  It looked awful and it tasted worse. I also spent the later part of my evening in the bathroom!  (not just me, hubby too) Never again will I eat at Genghis Grill...I actually thought about calling my bank and disputing the charge. This place is nothing short a high end really bad Chinese food restaurant, you know the  ind where you are eating and you know you will regret it later!!!!    YUCK YUCK YUCK...NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.. it's a little bit confusing for the first time. I think I would have rather looked at the menu first rather then having the waitress try to explain it to us. I got the thai chicken bowl and i thought it was good. We will for sure come back here."}
{"text":"You can create a decent tasting meal here, albeit overpriced. The two stars are for the cleanliness of the establishment. This was my second time dining here and I left with sticky shoes from the filth on the floor. It looked like a disaster struck the ingredients area with a large amount of food on the ground and counter. All of the raw proteins were mixed together from people assembling their bowls. Plus, this time around they managed to mix up the starches my boyfriend and I ordered. He got my udon noodles and I ended up with his rice. They offered to fix it by scraping our toppings onto the correct starches. Not sure how that was supposed to work considering the noodles were mixed in. Don't think I'll be back to give them a third try."}
{"text":"I love genghis grill!! My first time that I went I made a really small bowl but this time I piles it on!! They changed their system now. You pick a size bowl and then they give you a bowl to pile your stuff in according to your selection. PRICES went up people!! $9 for small $12 for medium and $16 for a large.   Udon noodles are delicious and the honey teriyaki is the sauce to go with!! WARNING...if youchoose to put calamari in your bowl...once the food is cooked and all is said and done it is very chewy because it was over cooked on the grill. So make sure you don't use that as a main meat source.  I love the coke machine. I can try various selections that I have never had much less never even heard of. Raspberry coke, interesting but delicious.  They did ask if I wanted a to go  box and they gave my daughter a to go box. So maybe the price jack included the to go box because before you couldn't take anything home unless you purchased the bottomless bowl which was damn near $20.  All in all a great place with great food....but bring a jacket because it is always and I mean always freezing!!"}
{"text":"Best Mongolian BBQ I've ever had anywhere hands down. There's also a full bar and sake bombers. Had to go rub one off in the bathroom due to my massive food chubby. OOM NOM NOM NOM NOM! FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP! Will repeat soon."}
{"text":"Loved the food & service at this place. Great concept to build your own bowl of healthy, fresh food.  Satisfied with the selection of meats, vegetables and sauces. Look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"We frequent Genghis Grill quite a bit and I'm not sure what happened yesterday but our service was AWFUL! First, my bowl was cooked without the sauce I clearly placed next to my bowl.  Then, my boyfriend's bowl came without the rice he ordered. Lastly, our waitress came to check on us once and that was to drop off the wrong drink.  The place wasn't very busy so I was really surprised at the lousy service."}
{"text":"Stir fry selection is great.  They have everything from steak to fish to scallops.  The only downfall is during dinner rush it can take a long time to have your food prepared."}
{"text":"They need to hand out wax paper or some kind of barrier to use for your hand when mashing all your fixings into the bowls. Even if it's to discourage people doing it, we're still going to do it so you might as well help us be a bit more sanitary. Service was okay."}
{"text":"I ordered off the menu. My mistke. the tofu bowl was very flavorless. I will not be ordering of the menu anymore. I will build my own bowl from now on. The lunch prices are a little up there at $9 for a bowl, but you will not leave hungry as the portions are hearty."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience Sunday at Genghis Grill with my wife. The customer service from our service John C. and the great follow up from the manager was definitely 5 stars. The food was also great and up to par. Well done everyone at Genghis Grill!"}
{"text":"I love the Mongolian style  bbq That being said this place needs Help !  How do you mess up a bowl When you make it yourself ? When you tell them fried Rice And your bowl comes back With noodles and black debris From a non clean grill Went 4 weeks in a row Hoping it would get better It was right 1 out of 4 times Not to mention I was the first one In there 1 time and the sit me the Furthest away from drink station What kind of servers don't get your drinks But expect a nice tip !"}
{"text":"The whole concept was pretty neat. The things I did like about our visit was our server Anna and the food was aright. Other than that the raw food that you get yourself before its being cooked looks utterly disgusting the way it was put out. My husband had to convince me otherwise. But I don't think it was fresh. The whole time we were there the workers or I guess \"food runners\" we're running around the whole restaurant coming to everyones table with other people's food. It was kind of annoying because most of them looked completely clueless and kept bringing other customers food to us. We ordered 2 appetizers the Asian guacamole and the pot stickers. We got the guacamole at a reasonable timing but we didn't receive our pot stickers until 15 mins after our stir fry came out. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're getting take out."}
{"text":"Sat for almost ten minutes without drink service. A family walked in at that time and was immediately helped. Spoke to the manager on they way out and they really didn't care. Won't be going back there,"}
{"text":"Okay so this place is not a restaurant you want impress your first dinner date with, but the loud, spirited stir fryers who cook up your Mongolian BBQ dish exhibition style (fire & all)  makes it a chill place you want to get together with your family and friends.  It's a AYCE joint.  There's a salad bar type area where you build and create your stir fry dish. Reminds me of the buffet part of Fiesta, but here you have more choices.   Ambiance - Contemporary design, casual atmosphere, the tables were a little squished in and noisy from everyone talking so loud that busy body me knows what's up in your life cause I can hear your convo. heh heh.   Service - Was greeted and seated right away....which was surprising considering it was super busy.  Our server Janine did great  She always checked up on us, kept our drinks filled and kept us up on the status of food which was being prepared. I didn't feel that our server offering us appetizers was \"up selling\" whatsoever, it's like at the burger place asking if you want fries with that? Just say no thanks that's all if ya dont want any.   Food - All the ingredients appeared fresh, the meats were cold, I didn't see any meats that were soaking in their juices that I had read in some reviews. (believe me I would've just left if I saw that)  The veggie choices were also at cold temps and were crisp.  The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the noodles I chose the first time around.  My husband really liked Udon noodles  though.   So the second round I passed on starches and loaded up on tofu, veggies, lil bit of beef, 2 seasonings, cilantro, skipped up on the starches and got a lettuce wrap instead. When I tried my second bowl of stir fry I was pleasantly surprised at my creation it turned out pretty good! My suggestion, skip the salt and  ease up on the sauces.  You dont want to drown out your dish with more than 1/2 a cup of sauce. It might end up being too salty or too sweet taking way the flavor of your dish instead of enhancing it.  Hence that \"tiny\" cup of sauce should be more than enough.  Or check out the little card recipes as your guide. That's your safest bet on your meal turning out good.  Both my husband and I liked our food creations and we enjoyed our first dining experience here."}
{"text":"Used to be ok, tried tonight and they stopped the  all you can eat.  So in other words you pay what a buffet costs and can only tty one thing. Pass.   At least until they change back to the original model."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so fun. Create ur own bowl and they cook it up for u!! Yummy!! New favorite spot and prices are so reasonable!!"}
{"text":"While I like the concept of this place, the implementation is not done well. The ordering system is overwhelming and there isn't much guidance. They offer so many options and endless combinations but the face paced environment doesn't give you time to create something good. Also the buffet was all over the place. Not clean, didn't look fresh, droppings everywhere, empty bowls. $24 total for two medium bowls + tip. Very mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Our second time at this chain restaurant.  Soup was cold.  Portions are skimpy no matter what size of bowl you choose, and very expensive compared to like restaurants.  Do yourself a favor and find a Mongolian grill where you can eat the amount you want without killing your budget!  There's nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"At YC's Mongolian BBQ, I can put as much rice or noodles as I'd like in my bowl. At Genghis Grill, my meal only comes up 1/2 a cup of rice.  At YC's Mongolian BBQ, I mix my own sauces into my meat and noodles and put as much as I'd like in my bowl. At Genghis Grill, I get yelled at for not following instructions and not putting my sauce into a cup.  At YC's Mongolian BBQ, I pay at the front, get my bowl, and go through the line, and seat myself. At Genghis Grill, I get seated at a table, curiously wonder if my purse will be stolen while I'm going through the line, and later given a check prompting me to tip someone who only served me a drink.  At YC's Mongolian BBQ, the vegetables all look crisp at the station, and the rice is warm and steamy. At Genghis Grill, the vegetables are watery, as if they came from 99c cans at the supermarket, and the rice is hard/stale when it comes served in my bowl.  At YC's Mongolian BBQ, I get complimentary soup/rice/drink/yogurt with my dinner purchase. At Genghis Grill, I get a big headache and wonder why I didn't just drive down to YC's."}
{"text":"We come here pretty frequently.  I've never had Mongolian stir fry in other restaurants b'c the only other place I've seen them at is at buffets and there's just other things to eat there!  I have, however, been to several other Genghis Grill and this on as far as service goes, is pretty good.  We've had a decent experience just about every time we've gone there.  I like this one more than the one on the NE side of town at the Tempe Marketplace.  As far as food goes, I should just rate myself, right, and not GG?  In which case, I give myself 5 stars!  I'm really good at mixing sauces!  If you've never been to a Mongolian BBQ joint, basically, the food is raw, you pick up what  meats, veggies, spices and sauces  you want and they will cook for you on this like big open griddle thing.  Good stuff.    I think they have a pretty good selection of meats and veggies and  yes, sometimes it's a little messy but I would say they are usually on top of making sure the counters are clean.  The mess usually comes from the veggies that fall out of people's bowl.  You put the meats in the bowl first so it is unlikely it will come out of the bowl and contaminate the counter.  Unlikely I say but I'm sure possible.  My only complaint is how they changed their pricing structure.  Years ago when we used to frequent a GG in Dallas, it was once price, all you can eat.  I never packed my bowl the way I do now and if anything probably got less food because I didn't feel like I had to \"get my money's worth\".  Now if you want all you can eat, it's a different price than if you got just one bowl.  I was taken aback by that the first time we went to this place b'c it had been  years since we had been to one.  If you are curious about trying a place like this, I definitely recommend!  If you feel intimidated, don't be.  The waitresses are very helpful and they also have these \"cards\" you can pick up that tell  you what ingredients to pick if you don't feel adventurous enough to make your own.  My tip to you: PACK IN THE FOOD. Use your hands and push down if you have to.  THat's what we do.  One bowl is PLENTY.  Most of all, have fun!"}
{"text":"This is why you shouldn't eat mall food.   Upon being seated, we were given metal bowls and were instructed to put our ingredients in these bowl. Choose your meats, veggies and sauce and hand it off the to dudes around the grill. Simple concept but I wished the ingredients were more fresh.   The entire restaurant was sticky. From their laminated menus to tables to the floor to the soy sauce bottles. No wonder they gave you wet wipes. You needed to sanitize your entire space before you ate.  My food was delivered to my table and just what I expected, junk. While I had a lot of control what goes in my food, for a first-timer, how the hell would I know what the sauces taste like?   They did have $1 mimosas during their happy hour. That was probably  the best part but the food was nothing more than a mish-mosh of crap."}
{"text":"I will never come back here again... They under cook their pork which is a big no no and got my son sick to his stomach. Then when we pointed it out to management he said what would you like me to do... Like really???"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, but if you want to beat the crowd make sure and be there when they open. 11 AM.  Can't find any place with fresher ingredients made the way you want."}
{"text":"They have 3 appetizers and we tried all three:  chicken lettuce wraps, chicken potstickers, and garlic citrus edamame. I really liked the lettuce wraps and edamame.  For $10, you get to build your ow Mongolian BBQ bowl.  They give you a silver bowl oand a side cup for your sauce. You first pick your meats: natural chicken breast, pork loin, marinated white fish, pepperoni, ham, turkey breast, sausage,marinated steak, sliced beef, shrimp, scallops, calamari. Then you season your protein with salt, pepper, garlic, ginger, cayenne, etc. Then you top it with your choice of vegetables. I wish there was more room for vegetables, because they shrink when you stir fry them. Then, you select a sauce (all MSG-free.)  The Honey Soy sauce was good.  Then, you bring your bowl to the grill and let them know your choice of: steamed rice, fried rice, brown rice, udon noodles, pasta, flour tortillas.  Drinks are separate. You go to the drink machine and there's a huge selection of flavored soda, etc.  Some of the meat was a little hard, but overall, the flavors were pretty good. And the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Simply terrible!!! They messed up and gave us someone else's dish, then the \"manager\" had my fiancée make a new order and wright it down. When he brought back his second dish it didn't even have the chicken in it... at this point we are so livid we asked for the check. They didn't  comp our meal or anything. What an awful company!!!! Will never eat there again or recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Solid spot for stir fry. Service is average, but the food is why it gets four stars. Really good bowls. No major complaints."}
{"text":"Airport food, thy name is mediocrity. Genghis Grill wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either. My husband ordered a Seoul bowl which I think was supposed to have Korean inspired flavors but it definitely didn't taste at all Korean. It was alright but nothing spectacular, and certainly not worth the money they charged for it.  I ordered a Thai bowl and it was depressingly bland. It was supposed to have a peanut sauce on it but it just tasted like frozen vegetables tossed with udon noodles. The chicken was tender and the tofu was alright but there just wasn't any flavor to anything. I ended up dumping the leftover sauce from the order of chicken potstickers we split over my noodles. It helped but it was unfortunate that I had to do that.  I did enjoy the potstickers so I'd recommend those, but definitely pass on the Thai bowl. The Seoul bowl was alright but certainly not something to write home about. All in all we spent close to 30 bucks on our mediocre meal but when you're stuck in an airport on a layover your choices are going to be limited.  Definitely be sure to check your order before you walk away though. When they first tried to hand ours over they were missing my husbands order and it took a few minutes to flag someone down to correct it. Also be sure to let them know if you have a food allergy because they use a large mongolian grill to cook the food so cross contamination will definitely happen if you don't give them a heads up.  I haven't been to a Genghis Grill outside of an airport before but my understanding is they're a decent place for Asian fast food. I'd consider going to one at some point but I don't plan on returning to this location, even if I am stuck in the Charlotte airport. There are other options that are hopefully less mediocre."}
{"text":"Such a cool concept; I would recommend to anyone looking for something different.  I went for the first time this past Sunday.  It was a little after lunch, not too crowded.  The waiter did a good job showing us the different size bowls for the build your own bowl.  Like I said, it was my first time - I got the medium bowl for $12.50 and it was so much food.    So what you do is pick your meats - and they have a large selection (steak, chicken, shrimp, bacon, etc); add dry seasoning then pick your veggies and then pick a liquid sauce.  You can sample the liquid sauces before committing.  I picked the island teriyaki and it was tasty.  But after you make the bowl with the raw ingredients you take it to their grill; this is when they ask what starch you want - rice, noodles, etc and then they cook it all in the open on this grill.   A few minutes later the waiter brings it to your table.    If you pick the right ingredients you can have an enjoyable meal.  And if you don't know where to start, they have suggestion cards - aka recipes.  But the medium was very filling.  For me it was two meals.  The prices seem a little high; so may want to check out during a weekday lunch.  But since it was my first time there, I signed up for their rewards program & they give you a FREE appetizer or dessert.  Definitely want to do that."}
{"text":"Over priced for sure.back home they have these all over and you get unlimited trips for $12-15 and the quality is higher. So when we ate here and it was that expensive and it's not even unlimited we were disappointed. Just okay. They do have good coupons out in the paper that never expire. You get 2 meals, 2 drinks, and a dessert for $22. Not too bad."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them 10 stars. I have been a fan of Mongolian BBQ for my whole life and short of my fathers restaurant this is the best. the veggies are always fresh, and the service is always great. The staff seem to actually enjoy working there and it goes a long way. You must eat here, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"It provides us a friendly environment to have a great time with our friends or families. The veggies are healthy and meats are fresh. Plenty of sauces will absolutely satisfy our special taste. Also, the self check-out machine is useful for those people who are in hurry."}
{"text":"This place is fun!  I love making my own dish!  Still trying to perfect the perfect dish but having fun trying.  I would love to see more seafood selections in the meats and other noodle selections."}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place and each time this place just disappoints. On this particular occasion we went and the place was empty, which is a hard feat in itself.   The food bar was messy, and most of the items were only half available. The bowls seem to keep getting smaller.   They also don't much service oriented people around, everyone was pretty snippy and rude, though the employees were congregated at the front of the restaurant playing on their cell phones and speaking inappropriately with us within ear shot.  We went the whole meal without refills and to check up on us.  I know this is a \"fast food diy\" concept restaurant but for the prices and the fact that there are employees doing nothing a little attention would have done well by this place.   Meh, is the best this place gets."}
{"text":"The food is good but it sucks that you can't go back to the meat section once you passed the veggies section because they'll charge you $4. And if your allergic to anything be careful, because when I was there my cousin poured scallops on her bowl but when she got some, well it dropped on the calamari and I'm allergic to scallops but I wanted the calamari and I had a surprise of corn on my bowl because it fell on the pineapple lol There is no difference if you get the regular or large bowl, it looks the same portion, just don't get the small bowl"}
{"text":"Food is great , love how you can make your own plate . The only thing that I didn't like was the bathroom , unpleasant odor .Would give 5 star but just because of the bathroom odor only 3 stars"}
{"text":"This place was good, but I'm mostly concerned about the random worker (was she a manager?) who jumped in the back to grill up the food without washing her hands or putting on a hairnet or hat. I hope she didn't cook my food.....that alone lost them stars."}
{"text":"So I've been to Mongolian places before and we all know the routine...meat, veggies, sauce and a starch...but this place  kicks it up a notch and adds seasoning...in my option this is what makes it taste better! And the meat is not rolled up frozen pieces, its fresh cut chucks of whatever you can think of steak, chicken, even marinated fish.  I opted for steak and shrimp with veggies, potatoes and the 3G and regular Stir Fry sauce, with the spicy cayenne pepper, Tabasco and garlic seasoning over steamed rice....and it was delicious!  In my opinion, very reasonable with price, a variety of choices and food cooked to order...I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Stack your bowl as high as you can with meats and veggies, and be sure to pack on the veggies - they always shrink. They have the biggest variety of grains it's great. The servers are always nice and the touch screen fountain drinks are always a plus. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I agree, cafeteria style and they cram you into a fast food type of eatery but, the hostess did move us from the uncontrolled kid area to a quieter area.  Our server was friendly and gives you a tour for first timers.  Pile all you can into the bowl since it all shrinks down big time.  I thought I put cabbage in there.....where did it go?  Anyway I liked it all with your many choices of meats, veggies, spices, and sauces.  So each time it's a different experience of flavor.  Of course their tea is freshly brewed.... A huge shout out to that!  We will definetly start this place into our rotation of frequent places to eat."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since I have been to this place once I have loved before. There is a new management team and you will notice a big difference. The cooks and the team are a lot nicer and understanding and the food is great. I had a bowl, drink and dessert. I like this a little more then how it was with the old management. I will be coming here more often now that the treatment is better."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was great! Good food, fresh ingredients and great customer service. Definitely my go to place. Need to have more locations :)"}
{"text":"I used to frequent here more often a few years ago but have gone less and less the past few years.  Something about this place is going down hill and I can't put my finger on it! The meat section always kind of creeps me out in terms of how sanitary it is , so when I come I stick to the veggies! What I do like about this place is the food tastes fresh and not greasy and comes out fairly quick!  Good option if you have vegetarian friends. I have never ordered off the actual menu so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was not desirable. They forgot my friend's lettuce wraps and we are on a time budget. It took 30 minutes for them to realize that she did get her food. Then the manager came over to apologize and gave her a buy one and get one bowl 20% off with a purchase of 2 drinks coupon.  And it doesnt apply to the unlimited bowl. They certainly know how to take care of customers (sarcasm). The people working there definitely were new and you can tell that they were being trained at that time. We wanted to pay because we were late for class and asked a different waiter to ring us up. They had to find the original server to deal with bill.  We would have went back but because this experience kinda blew. I dont think my friends would want to return."}
{"text":"So I've been here numerous times the past and it seems the format has changed.   I filled up my bowl only to hear one of the cooks at the end complaining about how much he makes and what is and is not going to do for his money. That being said I made sure he saw me put some money in is tip jar out of fear for my food.  When I got my food it was like only half of the topping came back, I was left wondering if I got the wrong bowl, but sure enough it was mine.   Not sure if I will go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0, I would! We were greeted nicely, seated and shown what to do. After waiting a short time for our bowls, the manager came to chat and see how things were. They were great up until I found a ROACH in my food! They quickly took it away and offered brownies and another bowl for me. Reluctantly, I agreed to another bowl and went and made it. Got it to go so I could pick through it at home! The part that is really really not acceptable is that not one part of my meal was comped!! I have been a server for years and that is just unheard of! Needless to say we will not be going back! Our server Was super! But really, charging me for a bowl with BUGS! The manager said \"it must have come in the cilantro, we get it in bulk and just rinse it\" UGH!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff , fresh protein , great sauces  .. Awesome place for a heavy weekend lunch  By the way if you check in you can get your second bowl for 1/ 2 off."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. It was pretty ok. I wouldn't give it 4 stars, although my boyfriend might.   We got a lot of food and took it home and really good service.  Service : 4 Food: 3"}
{"text":"This place is good. You get a card. You go pick how big you want your bowl. Fill it up with meats and veggies to the brim of what they give you. Pick sauce or seasoning. Pick noodles, rice, etc. They cook it you sit. And as long as your sauce was dank then the food don't stank. My dish was superb. Random meats, greens, garlic sauces and a spicy garlic something. I should have got noodles.cbut the fried rice was A1"}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple months ago but forgot to review it. I am very happy this place exists. My girlfriend told me it was \"soooo gooood\" and I thought it would be alright but after coming here she was right. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. I even had a 5-minute conversation with one of the servers about tattoos. Super relaxed place and friendly environment. But let's be real you guys want to know about the food. Well, the food was just AMAZING. I am begging my girlfriend to come back here but she doesn't want to because supposedly Genghis Grill is a Reno thing so she is keeping me away at least until I go to Reno with her and try it again over there. Why are girlfriends like this? Anyway, try this place. I'll come back after my Reno trip."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for a late lunch on a weekday, a day I took off work - decided to catch a movie and eat at a place we hadn't been to before.  Genghis grill offers a buffet style Mongolian grill food where you pile up your proteins, veggies and spices into a bowl. Load up on sauces in separate smaller cups and tell the grill master what carb (rice, fried rice, noodles, etc) you want everything stir fried with. There are also small cards with ingredients that you can refer to, if you don't feel like taking a chance.  I picked chicken, steak and sausages from the meat section. Piled on onions, green peppers, baby corn, jalapenos and added a whif of dragon spice, garlic, salt and red chilli powder. For sauces, I picked the dragon sauce and one other - can't remember the name. Told the grill master (thats how they call them, I didn't come up with that!) everything stir fried with fried rice.  Ended up with too much food and dragon sauces & spice were more hot than I imagined. Somehow I got into beast mode and pretty much chugged all of it down, but word for advice for you all - when they tell you that the spices are hot, specially the ones on the bottom rack, believe them!  The only other Mongolian place I've been to was Bd's Mongolian grill out of state where they let you pile everything up in multiple bowls if you have the capacity for multiple bowls. Here, I was handed only one bowl by the waitress - not that I needed more than one, but felt restricted in picking veggies.  If you have a serious appetite, I suggest you check this joint out. If you don't like how your food turned out, blame yourself for picking the wrong ingredients."}
{"text":"Used to like coming here. Every time i'm on this side of town i'd make plans to stop for lunch. Never had an issue. This current visit was sad. My husband and I each ordered rice for our starch and there was only HALF of what we were used to getting. The portion was so small that we left hungry. When we asked a server what was up with portion sizes she said people had been complaining that there was too much starch. Huh? Too much? Well now theres not enough to even fill up a normal person!   I doubt we'll be back   At this point i'd rather frequent green valleys buffet for Mongolian bbq."}
{"text":"My family and I tried to eat dinner at Genghis tonight and where very disappointed.  My husband is allergic to gluten and we checked them out online before going and they where suppose to be very accommodating.  When our server came to our table we made it clear of his food allergy, when we made the food we made it clear to the lady helping you load your bowl, and when we got to the grill we told the cook about his food allergy and even asked for it to be made with rice.  The cook was suppose to cook his food separate of all the other gluten dinners so as not to contaminate his but the cook just threw it on the grill with everything else.  We told our water and he said he would correct the problem but when his dinner came it was with noodles witch contain gluten and would have made him sick.  In the end my husband left hungry and I left mad.  The service was bad and the place felt like a fast food restaurant.  I love Mongolian grills but my food was disappointing and even without the food allergy mix up I would not wast my money and go back.  They did offer us a free desert but they looked bad and contained GLUTEN."}
{"text":"If your looking for something fun and not just sit down and serve me then this is the place. You grab your bowl and fill it with choices of meats then down the line you select veggies and then sauce it up!! Then it's grilled perfection and deliver to your table. It's fun to choose what will go well together. Each person can make their bowl to their liking!!"}
{"text":"Interesting way to get your meal. When they give you your bowl I advise you pack it full. I'm a big guy so the bowl isn't quite a full meal. Though, I will say it is enough. it's just that I like to get my fill if you know what I mean. You can pick up recipe cards that guide you through the preparation phase and then you hand it over to the cooks. Usually a wait/line to get in on weekends. Concept is interesting, food is good. We hit this place every two or three months for variety."}
{"text":"Very much like the Flattop Grill in Chicago, though with this I think you just get one trip? That part was unclear to me. The build your own stir-fry is great if you know what you like, and how to combine flavors--not so if you can't! \"Salad bar\" seemed clean, though the floor did not. Refill your own drinks. Seemed quick and efficient. They are part of a rewards program."}
{"text":"You get some great Mongolian at Genghis Grill! I like this place, but might be a little expensive for an everyday lunch option..."}
{"text":"I wish they had a \"0\" star option too!  The service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place?   NEVER GOING BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried out Genghis Grill because there is a similar place up North in Maryland where I am from. This placed turned out to be a decent choice. You are seated and then get a choice between the menu items or the make your own stir fry option. The most popular choice and what we did.   It is set up like a salad bar, you can fill your bowl up as full as you want, then some guys on a grill will grill it up for you and your server brings it to your table when its ready. The food was OK, not amazing but worth it for the price. It definitely fills you up. Service was good. I might come here again if I am looking for something without a wait on a busy weekend night."}
{"text":"Good food... Great waitstaff... Long lines :( .. Lots of combinations to put together... You should have some general knowledge of flavor combinations... Great place to try new flavors!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Genghi's Grill 3 times now and the service here is always great. By that I mean the servers are extremely friendly, and always prompt with your beverage refills. They really don't have too much to do in most cases since this is a true Mongolian style BBQ restaurant where you go up yourself to select your food before delivering it to the grill cooks.   Your food can taste anywhere from mediocre at best, to outstanding ... and it all depends on you. That's the beauty of this place. You select everything in your 'bowl' so you can truly create exactly what you want.   You start with selection your proteins/meats: there are about 15 choices ranging from chicken to pepperoni to scallops, and anything in between. Next you hit the seasoning station where you can jazz up the meat however you like. Then you hit the veggie station. Again, choices are almost endless here. You end the line up by picking what you'd like to flavor your meal with, with about 12-15 sauce choices. They're all awesome, but I personally like 1/2 ginger citrus & 1/2 island teriyaki. Maybe splashed with some honey soy.  Walk it all over to the grill where you select your 'starch' from white or fried rice, udon noodles, spiral pasta or tortilla wraps.   It's very easy to 'over do-it' with your bowl because everything sounds good. Be careful not to mix too many flavors or you'll end up with a disappointing meal!"}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing!! And I always come at night and sit in the bar! Mike is wonderful; always friendly, courteous, funny and has the perfect amount of distance but also being available. I will continue to come back :)"}
{"text":"It is what it is.. stuff that bowl. Better quality meat than YC's. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Used to go there and get a bowl and load it up. Now they're monetizing it with three bowl sizes, previous cost is now the small bowl. Waiters are a bit agressive to get their tips.  Great food, every time, i like the shreaded beef with brown rice, oh yeah! A bit pricy though, like $15 out the door with tips."}
{"text":"I really like it here. Our server was helpful and showed my husband and I how the restaurant works. You get a bowl and are able to fill it up with as much meat and veggies you want at the bar/station. You also pick your spices the sauce and the starch. The food is practically cooked in front of you (if you hang around the grill). The price is very affordable and if you want all you can eat its an extra $3.  There was a fundraiser taking place durning our visit and even though it was busy the service was relatively fast. I'm looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Heath department didn't find anything on inspection, but given how fast the wheels turn... Management doesn't care any more than their staff did the night of. Still not going back..."}
{"text":"The food is only good if you know how to season food...pretty pricy. But I'm in love with there mango lemonade!"}
{"text":"Drove out here from Cali for the weekend and noticed I had a microwave in my hotel room. I looked up big eatery spots locally rather than the strip because Vegas is known internationally for their food. Genghis Grill came highly recommended by the locals. I went in around lunchtime and got the large bowl. I love this semi-buffet-ness of picking out your own portions of proteins and veggies and then having them cooked up in your face Benihana style with your choice of starch.(If this place would had more protein choices, I would have gave this place 5 stars) You're responsible for your portions, sauces and seasoning so, if it doesn't taste good, you got nobody to blame but yourself. When getting your bowl cooked up by the chefs, give 'em at least of couple dollars so they cook your food more thorough with love. You even get to get your own drinks, so if you're thirsty....again blame yourself. Service was friendly and decent. You get up and do everything yourself so they're minimal anyways in your experience. For basically $20 I got to eat 2 meals in one day and had more money and time left to play the tables. Definitely have a good game plan when you come in here to maximize your bowl. I like to stack proteins then veggies on top of each other in that order. Good eats and experience."}
{"text":"I am upset that it took me so long to try this place. It's was absolutly fantastic!! The service, the atmosphere, the drink selection, the food!! Walking in, I didn't know it was anything like it was. First, you're seated and your server explains how it all works, they take your drink order, explain and offer some appetizers and then asks what size bowl you'd like..small, medium or large. Once you pick your bowl size, you then go up to the bar/buffet area where you put choices together. Pick from multiple different raw proteins and veggies...fill and pack that bowl with as much as you possibly can...pick your seasonings and then your sauces. Then, take your creation to the grill, pick your starch and give it to the cooks to put it all together and cook it all up for you. You can watch your creation come together or take a seat and your server will bring it to you. Our server today was Kelly and she was absolutely amazing. She explained it all perfectly and answered all of our questions. She even came up to the food line with us to make sure we knew what to do and to make sure we were 100% comfortable with what to do. We ordered the pork pot sticker appitizer which was amazing and my friend and I both loved the bowls that we created. I went with a chicken dish and her with a beef. I can't wait to go again and put some other stuff together. They have so many selections and concoctions that can be made..it's going to be an amazing adventure every time. I would recommend that everyone try this place at least once. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I love this great Mongolian grill restaurant. The service is friendly. I love how you can get three options like Udon noodles or brown rice and you can add an egg. They have a good selection of vegetables, meats, seafood and spices. The only bad thing is that I wish they had little recipes to make customized sauces. Love how these bowls taste. Be careful of what size you get since you add three options, you'll fill up quicky with noodles and brown rice."}
{"text":"I went to Genghis Grill twice within the first 2 weeks of its grand opening.  It is a Mongolian BBQ restaurant with an unusually large number of meats, vegetables, rice, noodles, and sauces to choose from.  If it's your first time, your server will show you through the buffet.  You fill up a bowl with meats and vegetables, and a small cup with your sauces (which you can sample in the line), and hand it over to a grill cook for preparation.  Choose your starch - rice, noodles, etc. - and you can watch it being grilled and pick it up, or have your server bring it to you.  Pros: delicious IF you get the right flavor combination, and some of the best customer service I've had in a Las Vegas restaurant.  Cons: pricey!  The bowl for your selections is very small.  You will need some architectural skills to build up your bowl very high.  The problem is that the vegetables cook down, so your prepared BBQ winds up quite small, and it's even served in a special bowl to make it look like more food than it really is.  They are also stingy with starches.  On my most recent visit, I overdid the sauce - not their fault - but the result was so strong that it needed rice to mellow it out.  The stingy 1/2 cup serving isn't enough anyway.  I wound up taking it home and make a pot of rice, and enjoyed leftoovers.   Tip: I recommend going at lunchtime for the unlimited bowl option and just make small bowls until you figure out what flavor combination you like.  Lunch is much cheaper than dinner.  Another tip: sign up for their Khan Club.  It's free and you get good deals through email."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place! The fact that I can get my money's worth by filling my bowl up with as much meat and veggies as I can and create my own combinations of sauce! The only thing I didn't like was how long we had to wait for our food to get cooked. Not a place to go when you're already starving. But def a great place to go any other time :)"}
{"text":"We were shopping across the street when we got a big whiff. A strong smell of onions and meat came wafting down to entice us in to have some mongolian bbq for the first time. We followed our noses and went and got seated in this busy place. That is surely a good sign. WRONG!   The server asked us if we had been there before to which we both answered \"no\". She handed us our menus and really tried her hardest to explain how the operation went down, but she was a little tongue tied. Can't fault her for it. Who knows how many times a day she has to repeat the process to newbies like us. So she tells us how it works as we peruse the menu.   Most of the menu is quite unnecessary as we went and got everything for ourselves anyway. Why was there a section that displayed drinks when we had to go and get drinks for ourselves in one of those newer Coca Cola machines where there seems to be a millon different selections? That is the only good thing about that place unfortunately. The only thing the menu really should be is an appetizers menu. There were about 3 extra pages that could have been eliminated.   After ordering some chicken potstickers we were on our way. We went up with our bowls and got in line to pick our ingredients. Some of it looked suspicious. I thought it would be rude to put my head in and sniff for myself if the seafood or chicken went bad. I tried to play it safe and went with beef. I added a multitude of spices, garlic, salt, pepper, etc. to my mix. I was anticipating good things because the smells that were all around were promising. We got up to the place where they take our raw bowl and cook it for us. I decided on the spiral pasta. We got some drinks and sat down. I understand there were others ahead of us in line. I understand it was busy. I understand that Sunday nights are not the best time to get speedy service. This was taking forever! My boyfriend got his food first. It smelled good, but it seemed to be \"barely\" cooked all the way. He is not one to complain so he ate it anyway. My food came about 15 minutes AFTER his. Even though I was right behind him in line. My food was also barely cooked. The pasta was very bland. Even though I filled my little 'cup' of stir fry sauce up to the top it was not enough. Most of my food tasted like plain noodles with hits of flavor every now and again. Immediately after eating I felt sick. I know it was the meat. We were never checked on. I had to track down our server to find out about our potstickers that never came. She acted surprised. She asked us if we still wanted them. I said yes. I wouldn't have ordered something I don't want. It was a mistake. I should have said no. They came out rushed. She must have forgot to put the order in and was rushing the cooks. The skin was not fully cooked and was like uncooked pasta. Crunchy. Blech!!! Never again. No apology about the late appetizers. Just dumped it on the table and left. Not happening. We learned our lesson. We should have read the Yelp reviews before wasting our time and money (and my squeamishness) ."}
{"text":"This was excellent, quick service. Very tasty food and every option you can imagine.  ________  Great eats, excellent service, second time here in the last week."}
{"text":"We came here 12/19/2014 @ around 0630. This was not our first time and absolutely love the soda machine. We sit down and it takes a minute for the waitress to get to us. It is okay no big deal but what happened next was hard to believe. There was a full on fight between a male waiter and a waitress he was complaining about her messing up our bill for our table (we haven't gotten food yet). We were not even involved, he kept saying to the waitress \" you are an idiot\". So finally that's over and I hear from across the room from another waitress \" IS THAT A REAL DIRTY DIAPER\" the waiter then looks at her and looks at what is in his hand brings it to his nose and responds \"YES\". This was the same waiter who was in the fight with another waitress earlier. He then proceeds to toss the diaper in the trash. Yep you know where is this going and walks straight up to where the food Is prepared and picks up a plate of hot food and brings to our table (same hand that had the diaper). I had eyes on him the whole time and never went to wash his hands. We regretfully can never go back for this reason."}
{"text":"The trick with the Genghis Grill is to either learn how to pack your food in a bowl or buy the bottomless bowl for a few dollars more.  That said, there isn't much of a selection of food choices other than the line where you pick what you want; and though there is cards to assist a person to make particular dishes, the reality is you are going to make-up your own version by sticking whatever you can into the bowl without it falling all over the place.    The menu offers a few appetizers that cost as much as the bowl, while the rest of the menu offer a variety of drinks.  When you are going on the line filling your bowl, if you are a indecisive person, you will be pressured by others waiting behind you to move fast.  They do allow you to try samples of the sauces, which is a good thing; but it will taste somewhat different after its cooked.  Overall, it's a okay place, but you gotta know what you want before you start grabbing the raw ingredients, or you may make something you might not like when it arrives at the table.  Good luck!  Oh yea, they accept the Ballantyne Card, so if you got it... use it, it will save you some money."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  You get to make it how you like it and with so many options for meats, veggies, spices, and sauces, if it taste bad than you probably picked the wrong combinations.  Ive been twice in the last week and look forward to eating here again.  For $10 I got more than I could eat and took the rest home.  Yeah you can pay a few bucks more for all you can eat, but if you pack as much into your first bowl you probably won't need any more.  I love spicy food, so I made a bowl of seasoned beef, chicken, brocoli, lots of jalepenos, peppers, garlic and used 2 different sauces and it was amazing.  My wife and kid love this place as well.  I definetly would suggest giving this place a try.  The servers have also been very polite and the atmosphere is exactly what I would expect which is a nice cozy place to enjoy a meal.  This is now my 2nd favorite place to eat after (El-Torito Cafe)!!!"}
{"text":"The server Brett was AWESOME!!! the restaruant is a little like a maze.. The food was really good. Picky eaters would be happy here. They have a huge variety and the food is plentiful. They even have wonderful suggestions.Also, it's user friendly."}
{"text":"Glad we found this place. Lots of healthy options and great for picky eaters because you can build your own bowl. At lunch, there were three difference sized ceramic bowls, which they have on display for you to choose from. Once you choose a size, they hand you a seemingly small metal bowl to load your toppings into. As a chubster, it seemed small until we realized that they add in your starch when they cook it for you...you don't add it into the small metal bowl.    My advice...go light on the self-serve spices because the sauces are loaded with flavor and sodium galore. Also add more meat than you think you need because it shrinks up significantly. Put broccoli on the bottom to build up. Staff wasn't very good at recommending sauce combinations, but you can ask to sample any of them before committing. When you go up to the cook counter and they ask for starch, they will let you do a combination (I got 1/2 brown rice, 1/2 udon noodles). Bring a dollar or two in cash for the cook's tip (I always like to know this ahead of time since I rarely carry cash).   All-in-all, a great meal. Our server was attentive and friendly and the food was fresh with many options. Far better than YC's with a better/cleaner atmosphere. A star taken off because it took quite a while for us to be greeted with no one at the front desk and several staff walking by without acknowleging us. The staff behind the bowl station were unfriendly and clearly disinterested in being there. We were also bummed that there were no shrimp or scallops as an option when listed on the menu. The fish and people behind the bowl station were such a small part of the experience that it wasn't a deal-breaker.   Give it a try! Yummmmo."}
{"text":"Reheated pre cooked food. You think it will be fresh because you watch them throw it on the grill but it was actually pre cooked and reheated.  Soft vegetables and tough as jerky chicken"}
{"text":"The food is good, if you know how to pick and mix your flavor sauces.  I wish they had some menu about combinations to make so I did not have to figure it out.  Love that you can put cabbage in your stir fry and no do starches.  However, this place is Pricey for what you get.  $15.00 is a full order entree at most Asian style restaurants that is shareable.  All of your protein and vegetables have to fit in this bowl and things like spinach cook way down.  I hate to say this but to get your money's worth you really need to just get protein and pack it in there really well.  The service is excellent but the beverages are pricey as well and they are self serve.  I think for four people our check was $100.    Its just a little over the top for a casual Asian place in pricing."}
{"text":"Ok went for the 1st time- kinda put up a fight... in the past I have been to plenty of buffett or make your own type places and end up w a bowl of uneatable food and a belly still angry, hungry and sad. I gave in and the people I went with 2 of 3 of us had never been here-  We were greeted at the door by hostess. She was a pleasant young gal who asked have we been here before- I think she could see my lack of excitement or want to be there but talked with ad as she sat us explaining that out server would be right over and if I had any doubts or dislikes to come let her know- So comes in our sever- Jaakko (yes this is his name) what a lovely man, his attention to everything and detail was over and beyond. He was not only friendly but he ooozzed hes passion for his job and love ove what he did. He explained how the ordering and making of the bowls worked- we laughed and he broke the ice and fear of this new place for me. He more then once said he would suggest ideas or I could read/ get us cards provided w recipes to make. He also was helpful on serving size (3 to choose from) it seems so simple but cups are deceiving and you could easily order a size WAY more then you could eat if this wasn't explained. The line you go through has a huge selection of meats and veggies. The selection is so vast you could eat 3 meals a day for a week with out having the same meal. You get to choose a sauce to add flavor along w seasoning and then off to the cooking area. Your asked choice of starch or even cabbage (vs rice, noodles, ect). I was offered an egg to add to it and it was a great success! I cant even tell you the shock of feeling like a chief and having control of  what I was eating and what was added or not. I was asked and offered if I didn't like it to be able to remake it but it was so good I cant wait to go again.  Now this isnt fine dine but for sure not a fast food place... it was a great costumer service experience and I cant tell you how great our service was. Thank you. Cant wait till I try more boldly bowls!!"}
{"text":"With a successful restaurant in Tempe Marketplace, I decided to grab a relaxing dinner at their PV Mall location after a hard day at work.  I should have thought twice about this poorly managed restaurant which unfortunately is carrying the Genghis Grill name.  When I arrived, the hostesses did not greet me with the same energy as the hostesses in the Tempe location.  Specifically, I waited for four minutes at 8:30pm on a slow night.  The variety of food was slim, and they no longer carry shrimp.  Though the cooks were kind enough to ask if I had food allergies, I watched as two cooks exhibited poor practices.  They dropped food onto the counter, then picked it up and put it back in some poor person's bowl!  Unappetizing....  My waitress was attentive, but when I mentioned my disdain for this location's choice to discontinue shrimp (it is one of my favorite items with Genghis), I overheard the snide manager, counting money at the end of the bar, tell my waitress \"If he wants shrimp tell him to f---ing go to Red Lobster across the street.\"  Classy.  Though my waitress did an excellent job, that manager's remark ruined the ambiance of my whole meal.  Much of the staff at this location varied.  My waitress did an excellent job, but that is where the compliments stop.  The cooks and other staff members looked disheveled, and I had the unfortunate experience of watching one male staff member reach under his shirt and scratch his chest.  Perhaps my standards were too high as I have been spoiled by the appeal of the Tempe staff.  The Tempe staff's uniforms were in unison, and the diverse staff all remain appealing to give diners a great experience.  The PV Mall Location appeared to be comprised of a poorly trained group of people who do not take pride in their work.  As someone who waited on tables for 10 years, I understand the challenges and mistakes a waiter may make in one night, especially on Thursdays.  I do however recognize customers go out to eat to be entertained and to allow someone else prepare meals and not have to worry about dishes after a busy hectic day.  Customers should not cringe, wondering if the cooks are preparing their food properly or happened to have dropped your food before serving you.  I hope Genghis' corporate offices keep an eye on this place, because it is in bad need of an overhaul.  If they want to protect the Genghis brand, they may want to focus on improving this poor excuse of a franchise."}
{"text":"So you go through the usual buffet kind of line to fill your bowl and then give it to the cook at the end.   The problem: There is no one tending the \"buffet\" and almost every thing was empty.  The chicken and beef bins were empty.  There was plenty of ham and pepperoni (what?).  The broccoli, bean sprouts, baby corn, onion and tofu bins were also empty.  We complained about it, and the staff said sorry, but did not do anything about it.  Boooo."}
{"text":"This is not a review or the staff or product, just ownership and management.   Usually I would rate my visits a 4 or 5, but not today. Staff was all friendly and helpful as usual, but the bowl \"bar\" where you build your bowl was VERY understocked. Several items were low, and a few items  weren't even available, broccoli, snap peas, sprouts, mushrooms for example, weren't available. When we asked about this, the lady restocking what they did have just said they didn't have it and that was that. I later heard one of the cooks telling someone else that the produce provider had been price gauging or something and they had caused the issue. Only a couple members of the wait staff even knew they didn't have a few items, and we weren't aware of it until part way through adding items to our bowls.  Ownership and/or management needs to be on top of situations like this, and informing staff so staff can let customers know. Either go buy produce at Costco or a grocery store so you can provide it, or let it be known you don't have it."}
{"text":"Omg. My boyfriend and I went for a date and we had never been before! But we were greeted at the door by Aaron and waited on by him and he was SO FUNNY!!! Literally made our experience so great. He talked over everything we needed to know and every question we had and always made sure our drinks were full and that we had smiles on our faces. Not to mention that the food was amazing! He even made desert great. Both my boyfriend and I agree that this is definitely worth coming back to. I don't even mind the price if this is how great the service is!!!"}
{"text":"Ever since Genghis Grill opened at Ballantyne Corners, I have avoided going there because I was not excited about the concept.  However, last week, when I went to lunch with a few co-workers, this is the place they picked.  So I decided to suck it up and give the place a try.  Honestly, I have to admit, the place was much better than I expected  (I really had low expectations).     For those who have not yet been, here's the deal. You go in, place your drink orders and your server walks you back to the buffet-style set up.  You are given a bowl for your protein & veggies.  You are also given a small container for your sauces.  So, you first choose your protein - I went with chicken & shrimp.  Then, there is a little station where you can add some dry seasonings - salt, pepper, spices, etc.  I chose a little dragon pepper, salt, and cayenne. Then, you add your veggies - I went with fresh carrots, fresh broccoli, and water chestnuts. Finally, you have a selection of sauces to choose from. I decided to play it safe and just do teriyaki.     You then take your selections up to the counter where the cook will ask which starch you want- I chose brown rice.  They give you a number and throw your selections on the grill.  Once the food is ready, your server will bring it your table.   My food was much better than I expected, yay!   Overall, if you are looking for a fast-casual reasonably-priced place that can be semi-healthy (if you go heavy on the veggies, choose a healthy protein, and go light on the sauces), this is not a bad choice.  However, since it is a big corporate chain, its not much on ambiance and I don't think its a particularly good choice of a place to go if you are going with more than 2 or 3 people.  Since you have to go through the line to pick out your food & then take it up to be cooked, the prepared dishes all come out at different times."}
{"text":"When I was much younger, one of my absolute favorite things to do was to go to the long-since closed Mongolian BBQ at PV Mall.  It was kind of like a sport to figure out how to jam as much food as humanly possible into that tiny bowl.  Well, it has been at least a decade since I've tried Mongolian BBQ, but it is still as fun as I remember.  I mean, who doesn't like to watch their food sizzle on the grill?  I like how Genghis Grill really streamlines the process.  Recipe cards for the newbies (I ignored them and created my own, but I later wished that I had tried one of their creations instead!).  My bowl consisted of sliced beef and pulled pork, cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, peppers, green onion, and cilantro.  I didn't fill it nearly to the top, thinking that I would order a bottomless bowl and return for a different flavor combination.  However, I ended up being pretty pleased with my original creation and plenty full, so I didn't go back for seconds.  All of the ingredients seemed fresh, and there was a solid assortment of options.  I particularly liked the quantity of sauces provided.  My advice with the sauce - don't use a whole cup unless you really like saucy dishes.  A half-cup was plenty for good flavor and no dips.  I liked the friend rice that I chose as a starch, and the rice noodles that my man ordered were really tasty too.   The service was fantastic.  Even though it is a fairly casual restaurant, we had prompt, courteous service, were check on by a manager, and our server had a great sense of humor."}
{"text":"I love this place I've been coming here since it opened and it's still amazing. Great food tons of options & so much fun. I love how they are always adding new items to the menu. I haven't been here in awhile and I definitely need to come back more often.    I'm changing my review because I've come back after a long time not being here and this place has really changed. It's unfortunate I loved this place but it's bad now. There is some $4 penalty for going back to get certain foods. The system with the cards isn't fun or friendly and the staff is pushy and quick to move you along unlike before the staff was so much fun. My server at table 33 at 3:30 was great I don't want anyone thinking she wasn't good she's very good."}
{"text":"Technically you can't review this place bad on the good side because you're making it. From what meats you want, to what spices you want, to what veggies you want and to he sauces. So if you mess up what you put than you won't be satisfied on the food. So if you don't know how to cook and you're going out to eat I don't prefer coming here because you will be lost. But to a person like me who loves to cook I enjoy coming here and trying different things. But let's start on how everything works, you walk in and you have to get seated. After being seated they come and ask what you want to drink and than they give you a card you put your name on and you go in the line and select what size you want and you start making your food. The prices are kinda dumb being Small to medium is like a dollar difference... And the median itself is pretty expensive considering you don't get any bread or any side with your meal. The happy hour Beer and Sake deals are really good. Place is clean always. Just need to add more things it's just boring. So only thing to eat is a bowl you make? No salad or soup? Overall it's not a bad place."}
{"text":"Hey! This place was pretty good! It was my first time being there. The experience was weird and different, in a cool way.   You sit down. A server comes up to you. They get your drink orders and ask if this is your first time.   You get up and assemble your bowl. The first station is the meat station. You choose a type of meat (or meats) and move to the second station where you season it. After that is a vegetable station. They have a great variety! Fouth is the sauce station. They have anywhere from sweet to sour to spicy! Lastly, you go up the chefs, they confirm your order, and get cooking while you sit down and wait for them to bring your food!   If you don't like your food, it's probably because you didn't mix it right. LOL I,  on the other hand, am a good food compiler so I didn't have that problem ;) haha  It did smell a bit weird in here though.  You should try this place out at least once."}
{"text":"This place is a colossal ripoff. Their medium bowls are bigger than the large. They scam you every way possible. The rules and complexities are mind numbing. The prices are ludicrous. You're gonna eat here and feel like you got STOLEN from. You might as well go right to chipotle. You'll get twice as much for half the price. Stay away unless you like seeing your money burn right along side your food."}
{"text":"I like this place.   I liked it better when we first found it and they still served shrimp.   Pros: make your own bowl, get your own drinks, no waiting for service if you don't order extras. mix and match meats, veggies, sauces, etc.   Cons: it is REALLY awkward to reach the items in the back row, based on how the \"sneeze guard\" is situated. They stopped serving shrimp. It gets really messy sometimes (possibly also due to the awkwardness reaching the back items). there isn't really much service if you don't order extras. we've had to ask for clean bowls multiple times when they were handed to us.   I will still go here, and I like it, but it's not a \"must have\" list."}
{"text":"Amazing service every time we have gone! Food is super filling and love all the choices! I especially like that they take special consideration for people with food allergies"}
{"text":"There's just something about filling up a bowl with your favorite ingredients and knowing you have the option to repeat this process an unlimited number of times.  Maybe it's the hunter in me, or just the boundless enthusiasm I attach with the ability of choice combine with meat.  The concept is simple for your typical mongolian grill.  This place has a great location in Tempe Marketplace and it's quick if you want to catch a movie next door.  This is pretty much a staple whenever I visit the Phoenix area.  If you've never done mongolian grill before, don't fear -- the food is completely sanitary, preserved under the right conditions, and constantly replenished.  And vegetarians, delight in that you can have a healthy meal sans meat, despite the salivating carnivores around every turn.  You can go for a single bowl, or upgrade to unlimited for just a few bucks more.  The sauces range from mild to insanely spicy, so there's really something for everyone.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Here on a Friday evening after a long week and just looking to enjoy a nice meal.. And greeted by a waitress who was not so attentive and not so friendly. Food is great but but could use but could have had a much more pleasant evening if the waitress was nicer!  Server name: Smith"}
{"text":"This is in response to the condescending owner of Genghis Grill.  Unfortunely for you, I'm a bit more educated than your average diner.  I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers.    First off, I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes.  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant.  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time schedule.  Your goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water.  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar and/or fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo.    Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that \"Kung Pao\" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces.  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour.    I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do.   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for me.  Your comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different.  YC's does not specify a serving size.  Neither do you!  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 0.5 ,1, or 2.  What does this mean????? g? oz? tsp? tbs? cup?  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate.     YC's charges .50 cents for a take-out box not $1.  I was charged 9.99 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order.  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 8.99 well then you do the math.  You only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response.  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice.  I usually rate generously.  My initial review was my honest opinion.  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me.  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation.  I'm sure you will stay busy but I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"*Be careful if you have allergies, the cooks don't read your instructions*   I've been to the tempe location of genghis grill several times, and it's a refreshing change from the usual mongolian grill places like YC's. I appreciate the fact that they have brown rice, and healthier options, you can go all veggie, you can go all meat, it has equal parts food for everyone to enjoy. The offering of shrimp and calamari is nice too, few asian bbqs offer anything good, just frozen white fish.  My problem with this location is that the people running the grill are not careful enough and I doubt their grasp of the english language. In any other case I would not care who speaks what, but when it comes to actual concerns about food ALLERGIES, the guys cooking the food, to your instructions, should understand what you said and take it seriously  The last time I went here I was with a group, I put my dish together with what I like, and I never add any of the flavored sauces, their sauces have ingredients that I am allergic to. When your done you go up to the counter and you tell the cooks what starch you want,  and you can even write on a special request card about allergies, and any requests. I wrote down allergies, clean stove   You'd think that cooks in charge of people's food, with a guests' allergies in mind would understand that it is important and watch their work. Nope. I got my bowl, it smelled sweet, and it was visibly darker than usual, I had my friend take a bite and it was for sure cooked in sweet teriyaki sauce, the bowl was ruined for me and the line was now long and huge, I'd have to wait 20 minutes to get back to dinner if I went back in line. Lame.  Presented the problem to a manager, and the reply I got was this: \"Ohh there's sauce, we can wash it off real quick with hot water, you won't taste it\", I reminded the manager that this was an allergy, you can't wash it off, and I was offered a new bowl and to cut in line in front of everyone. Okay, nice enough fix, the manager did what they could to fix it after the fact, but it was a cruddy experience.  When I tell a cook in plain english that I have an allergy, and even write it down on a card for them to read while doing their job, and they don't do it, how do you trust them after that? Lame. I'm never coming back to this location ever.  Otherwise, it's a fine place to chill...they just need to clean up the serving ladels and spoons, those things are sticky...gotta sanitize towel that stuff."}
{"text":"Stopped on my way here from punts Cana to California and was extremely disappointed. The man at the register was beyond rude and neglected to make the bowl I had asked for. Defeated the purpose of \"make your own stir fry.\""}
{"text":"I have been to other Genghis Grill locations and always liked them, but the one in Vegas was a total disappointment. The waiter came around just twice during the whole meal and couldn't answer basic questions about the size of the bowls (which were all different shapes, which made it hard to figure out how much they held). This was also the only location I've seen where people have to get their own drinks; if I'm getting my own drinks and my own food, what am I tipping for?   The food bar was well-stocked, but as I was eating the shredded beef in my dish, I kept finding bones in my food. It happened twice, and it was really gross.   I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"It was okay for a bowl of sauteed veggies. Their sauces are pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is fresh and the service is always excellent. Sure sometimes the line can be long but it is worth it.   And you get free bowls for birthdays if you join the Khans Rewards."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelper told me to give this place a try & I'm happy I listened. Food portion was huge!! When placing order they ask what are your food allergies which is a good thing being that most places are not concerned about a person's allergies.   The menu selections look very limited but you can create your own bowl. I had the beef and broccoli bowl on noodles with a side of teriyaki sauce. The bowl came with broccoli, mushrooms, zucchini, and squash and onions sautéed in the bowl.  On the way flying back into Charlotte airport I wanted to stop by this location again however I had a connecting flight and I was unable to stop by. if I am ever in the Charlotte airport this will be my number one location eat at"}
{"text":"Way over priced! Meat and vegetables didn't look too fresh. Genghis Grill was so super good back in the day... Too Bad they got greedy."}
{"text":"This is my second time here in the last month. The first visit was a dinnertime dine in. Today's visit was a to-go order. Customer service was great on both occasions. The recipe cards really help. The choices are plenty. All I can say is yummy! I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"This place is only as good as the ingredients you choose. I learned that the hard way while trying to make sure my dish would be spicy. I overloaded on the heat and my meal was barely edible. It takes some practice to make the perfect meal, making sure to not overdo a particular ingredient or seasoning (dragon salt in my case). I recommend asking someone for some recipes, or finding a recipe card."}
{"text":"Staff was ok except one. Went there during lunch hour and as we are getting ready to prepare our bowl. one of the members of their staff yells at me with an attitude \" you cant be back here\" what she is talking about the area between the 2 self serve veggie/ meat station. One bar was closed but with all the respect it is hard to reach to an item that is way in the back so I went to the other side to make it easier to reach and this girl yells at me from across instead of coming closer to me and warning me it is not allowed to be on the other side. How rude! what is ur location's goal here? go big or go home! I wont be visiting again."}
{"text":"This place is an amped up version of a mongolian grill.  The meats are all fresh not frozen, they offer gluten free options, and are allergy conscious, there is a huge variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, seasonings, sauces, etc. The blue dragon fishbowl was a fun drink to share. The flaming arrow was also an interesting and good choice as well. The staff was great. Its right next to the movie theater and shopping so location is great too."}
{"text":"The 1 star was for the food the rest was for the serves. I made the same bowl twice and it could not have been made more different by the cooks. Not to mention the fact they took my not even half eaten bowl while I was making the 2nd one. They say you go some where for the food you go back for the serves well I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the choices and now that they have 3 different size bowls to choose from before going down the line and packing as much as you can in your bowl is perfect. The options are great for vegetarians and meat eaters (seafood, chicken, or red meat) the way they have it set up for the meats first is perfect so all the greens are the toppers makes it easier to truly build the perfect bowl. They have around 20 different sauces to add to the flavor at the end of the line prior to picking your choice of maybe 8 different noodles or rice to add to everything else. At the end you hand them this bowl of your desire, go sit at your table enjoying an ice cold beer or soda while the crazy team of stir fry guys heat up and mix all your toppings."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Quickly prepared and brought to the table. The servers are all friendly and quick to make sure we were taken care of. Our server was John C.. Thank you for a great time and service. And thank you for holding the door for us when we left. Wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Garbage. Hard noodles. Poor serving SIZE.   I really think the only thing they serve is disappointment.   GO TO YC'S MONGOLIAN GRILL.... IT'S WORTH THE 30 MINUTE DRIVE.  Seriously though for $11 you literally get one cup of meat and vegetables...I thought it was the childrens portion. There's a funky smell from their meat area as well.  I was having second thoughts, but I had two hungry boys to feed.  Both kids didn't eat their bowls because they had hard noodles and they were just not appetizing. We mentioned it to the server and he says \"that happens sometimes\".... And that was it.  We paid for our meal, left and I took the boys across the street to Chipotle to eat.  **RESPONSE TO OWNER COMMENT\"\" They revised the original response to my review.   Poor quality, no value... Plain and simple. He deleted the first response asking me to come in for a free meal (still didn't go back btw).  Another thing I thought of is they seem to show \"udon\" noodles as an option by providing large WHEAT noodles.  Udon is large round RICE noodles, I would hate to see someone think it was rice they end up with an allergic reaction if that is the case."}
{"text":"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The fact that you get to choose all your toppings, seasoning, sauce and starch, as someone else mentioned, if it's not good you can really only blame yourself. They even have little cards that show u what things to add to make a certain type of bowl. So if you wanted a teriyaki chicken bowl you would include chicken, broccoli, pineapple, teriyaki sauce and your choice of rice. The card has the calories on there as well so If you follow the recipe you can estimate about how many cals your taking in. I made a really tasty Thai chicken Bowl with their spicy peanut sauce and udon noodles and it was really good. My only gripe was there was not enough sauce so it was a little dry which was my own fault. The server was friendly and attentive and we left full. The only thing i can say negative was right by the bathrooms there was this rank smell coming from I guess the kitchen area. Makes you wonder what's really going on."}
{"text":"John is our favorite server. He always has an upbeat personality and has great customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Fresh, yes that is Fresh meat, not that frozen/small meat that you get at YC's. The meat doesn't shrink like it does at YC's. You don't have to guess on the sauces and or mess around with making them. Service has always been great and friendly, I think I have eaten there about 25 times in the last year and I have always been extremely happy. The drink specials are second to none. It really bothers me when people are complaining about the price, it is like 10 bucks, if you cant afford 10 bucks for a meal that you are going out for then maybe you should stay in. Also people that are mad about sizes, you do know you can go back up, they are all you can eat for like a couple more bucks, but if you make it right you should never have to go back up. This place is so so good, they are busy all the time, and it is a really fun place to check out. Everyone should go there!!!"}
{"text":"I would've given them 5 stars if their arrangement of ingredients was better. You had to go forwards to get a plate then walk back to start with your meats then forward again to get the rest. In other locations it was continuous and just flows better."}
{"text":"Literally sooo amazing giving it a 9/10. Food is awesome, establishment is clean, servers are friendly, the chef even makes great suggestions! I'm only keeping one point because... they don't have.... YUM YUM SAUCE  I need the golden good stuff please add it"}
{"text":"I've gone to this Ghengis Grill many times, it is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at. But I went tonight and it was one of the worst times I have ever been out to eat. I made my order and took it to the grill. My waitress brought my bowl back and it was the wrong order. She took the bowl back and then I saw at the bar, they had messed up a lot of other people's orders. She eventually came over and asked me what I had in my bowl and I told her. So she brought me a bowl, which had most of the meats and vegetables I ordered, but it had none of the starches I ordered and no sauce with it. The food was not good and I had to add soy sauce and salt just to make it eatable. The thing I'm most upset about is my waitress didn't apologize for the order being wrong, and she didn't even discount my order even though it was missing things. I felt I should have only had to pay for a regular bowl since that's what I received. The staff and restaurant was very below average, and I'm not sure if I will be returning anytime in the future."}
{"text":"This was My first time eating here and I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was super friendly and prompt. They have great happy hour specials. $5.00 sake bombers!!! woo hoo !!  Karrisa (hostess) and Mike our waiter was fantastic!! the food is great too!"}
{"text":"ok food.nice selction and variety of choices."}
{"text":"This place was great! I love picking out exactly what I want to eat the meat, veggies, sides, seasonings and sauces! Our food was delicious and perfectly cooked by the guys. Best time to come is when your on an empty stomach because you will get your fill. I'll have to go more often to get better at my stacking. The only complaint I have is the sticky floors . .I was wearing sandals and I ate floor as well as what was on my bowl."}
{"text":"After reading the other yelp reviews I was looking forward to trying this place.  I generally like asian food. Unfortunately it didn't deliver  I had the chicken teriyaki bowl on brown rice.  The flavors didn't mix well.  The teriyaki seemed more like straight soy sauce and the carrots were raw.  I also ordered the lettuce wraps (I was hungry) which were slightly better.  The sauce was flavorful but the chicken filling seemed like they put it in the blender for too long.  There aren't a lot of great food options in the Charlotte airport but unless you are craving Asian stir fry, I would look elsewhere"}
{"text":"Today we stopped here for lunch and really enjoyed ourselves. We were greeted quickly and seated right away. Our waitress did a great job explaining how to order and how the build your bowl works.   I picked out chicken with a bunch of vegetables, and chose spicy soy sauce. The grill cook was very friendly and gave us suggestions. I went with brown rice and udon noodle. I doubt I will be getting the udon again  the brown rice was very good. They let you take your leftovers home so pile high and you can have lunch for tomorrow!  Overall it was great, it left me wanting to try more. We will be back here again. If you like the Mongolian grill at buffets, this is like that but 10x better. I would recommend stopping in here for a meal."}
{"text":"If the food doesn't taste good, its probably your fault. They give you a small metal bowl to fill up with what ever your tummy desires. First stop is protein. They have various types from chicken, pork, beef, turkey, scallops, imitation crab meat, etc. I like how the meat is in pieces/chunks and not frozen, thinly sliced and rolled up like at other Mongolian grill restaurants I've been to. Then there are about 10 different dry seasonings available (spicy and non-spicy) to sprinkle atop the meat. Next you fill up the bowl with as much veggies as you can. Make sure to stack it high cuz it'll shrink to half as much once stir-fried. Implement some sort of stacking strategy to get the most of out your money. However, it's priced pretty well. 8.99 for lunch and 9.99 for dinner. I think it's $2 extra for a bottomless bowl. Anyways, next there at least 10 different sauces to choose from and then the starch - brown rice, fried rice, steamed rice, pasta, tortilla, or udon noodles. The grill masters stir fry up your food and your server delivers the bowl to your table. or if you want to stick around and watch at the grill then you can pick up your food there.  Bottom line: there are so many options from meats, seasonings, veggies, sauces, and starches that if your bowl happens to turn out as not tasty, then it's probably your fault. (ok, I've only been once and the food quality was fresh and tasted delicious when i went, but everyone's experience can be different.)  I don't recommend this place when you're in a rush during peak hours. Service-wise, it took a while for our food to get out because we happened to go at the end of lunch rush hour. The line to fill the bowls and to get them to the grill was long, but at least I was in good company and the entree turned out to be well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Earlier today (Friday Aug. 12, 2011) I attended Genghis Grill for lunch.  I was able to find the establishment with no troubles, and parking was bountiful.   When my date and I walked in, we were given a tin bowl and were escorted directly to an open booth.  Our drink order was taken seconds later and we were told we could go up and begin to create our custom stir-fry bowls.  I must say, I did not understand or believe people that said you can get any meat you want, and as much of it as you want.  Well, this is 100% true.  To the side of the restaurant, there is an open serving area with the labels: \"Proteins\", \"Seasonings\", \"Veggies\" \"Sauces\" and you pick your \"Starch\" at the grill.    When the food arrived a few minutes later, I was more than pleased with my unique and one-of-a-kind creation.  Initially, I was worried about how my sauces would mesh together - I went with the mongolian bbq, 3G, and dragon sauces.  But it turned out to be the perfect combination of sweet and heat.    Overall, I was extremely pleased my Genghis Grill lunch experience.  It was extremely filling and as very well priced - around $22 for two people  (I have taken a picture of my bill).   **BEWARE**  - As others have stated, beware of mixing different sauces.  Be sure you know what your getting.  -You are allowed TWO starches if you prefer.  I recommend the tortilla and brown rice.  -If you live anywhere in north Charlotte, it can be over a 25min drive. -This place has a ton of options to choose from.  To be  prepared, my date and I went on the Genghis website where you can use their interactive menu to draft your meal before you go. This place can be hectic during prime eating hours. My date went here a time prior, and felt rushed by other patrons behind her. Therefore on this trip we planned our meal ahead online and went during non-peak hours."}
{"text":"Love coming here from the time they open in Henderson. Food always comes out amazing and I always have leftovers for the next day.  Love making my own bowls of food. Sometimes it's a bit burn but it comes with the grilling."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!! You have to try it. They have 'Create your own bowl' or specific mongolian bowls. And other goodies. I love cooking so I always hook up my own bowl and I am never disappointed. They have all the meats to create your own bowl and vegan options as well."}
{"text":"Typical Mongolian BBQ grill - you get a (smallish) bowl, choose your proteins, veggies, sauces, and starches, then hand them over for cooking. They bring the finished dish to your table. I chose chicken, salmon, scallops, a variety of vegetables,  a curry sauce, and rice noodles. The resulting dish was OK, a bit on the bland side; perhaps this is because I didn't take as much sauce as I should have. The staff is friendly and helpful, but the queue at the ingredients trays moves slowly."}
{"text":"A decent restaurant for the airport. Had the vegetarian tofu one.... I was really very hungry and I enjoyed this hott freshly prepared meal !!! Very satisfying"}
{"text":"I've got to say, I was a bit hesitant to try this place even though it has been open for quite a while now.  I have either heard that people love it or that they have gotten food poisoning/diarrhea from it.  I fall, somewhere in the middle, yet closer to the loving it stage.    I like how you can pick any meat and vegetable that you want but can see how there can easily be some cross-contamination with the tongs.  It also took me awhile to get everything I wanted (because I wanted it all) and there wasn't a line.  I can easily see how it could take forever to get through that line.  It was rather quick though when we got it to the griller.    It was tasty.  I combined a lot of flavors and it still turned out pretty great!  I say definitely go and try it.  You will get a lot of food for not too much money.  I was lucky enough to have bought a Groupon so I saved even more.  The desserts looked great but I didn't try any.  Lastly, my stomach was fine after but within an hour or so, maybe longer, it definitely began to rumble and continued for a good portion of the day so beware!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place 3 or 4 times.  Very tasty food, and reasonably healthy depending on what you put in your bowl.   Not much ambiance but since it's a chain, that's not expected.  Good for lunch!"}
{"text":"Mongolian BBQ Time  As my husband woke up today one of the first things out of his mouth was \"I'm hungry\"! I responded with we have this and we have that...but nothing was going to satisfy his craving except some mongolian bbq. I haven't ate any mongolian bbq in years, mainly because of food crossing other food. So, if you have any food allergies this could be dangerous. But my issue is with sesame seed oil, its a big trigger for my migraines. And being 8 months pregnant, well...I could go without the hassle of a migraine! As you could imagine my excitement about lunch was that of going to the doctors, but I sucked it up with a smile on my face.  As we walked into Genghis Grill we were greeted by the friendly staff. The place was clean and had a good atmosphere. Our server was nice and showed us how to build the bowls. She also asked if we had any allergies...so nice to know that they care about their customers. I was amazing at how organized and clean the food station was. The meat, vegetable, spice and sauce assortment was amazing, way better then any other mongolian bbq I've been too before! You have the choice of creating your own mix or taking a recipe off the wall. I chose shrimp, fish, cabbage, pineapple, mushroom, tomatoes, green & red peppers, bamboo shoots, snow peas and some great sauces! A little tip, press the vegetables down as you add more, otherwise you won't be able to fit everything you want in the bowl! When we got to the grill, the cook asked again if we had any allergies! Wow, thank you so much for asking that Genghis Grill grill cook!!! The grill cook will also ask if you want steamed rice, brown rice, noddles, spiral noddles or tortillas shells. I love all the different varieties of this place!  As we sat and waited for our food, it gave us a better chance to look over the menu. They have appetizers, desserts and a nice selection of beverages. By the time I was done reviewing the menu, the server brought us our food. Be fore warned...food is very hot when it comes off the grill!! I burnt my tongue, so don't be tempted to dig right in! After my tongue felt better and the bowl cooled off, I was able to taste my creation. Mine was delicious and my husband said his was pretty good as well! For an extra few dollars you can make your bowls unlimited, not that you really need too! Mine was filling enough but my husband had to try it again! After finishing my bowl and watching my husband eat his second, I decided to try some of their desserts. A nice  piece of pineapple cake. This was no ordinary pineapple cake, it had layers of cake and a type of cheese filling layers with a piece of pineapple in the middle. It was super yummy and the side of vanilla ice cream it came with, only made it that much better!!  So, as an over all experience...I'd say...I'll be back soon to eat more!! If you are lucky enough to have one of these in your area and you haven't tried it yet, you should! You don't know what your missing!!   http://inapplesworld.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"Yum! Love Mongolian BBQ. Waiter brings your food to you at your table after you've left it with the cook. Just wish they were more attentive to my wine glass."}
{"text":"This place is good.  Great selection of meats and veggies then different sauces, oils and such.  Recipe cards if you want to copy one of their recipes.  They cook it and bring it to your table.  Appetizers are decent and beer is ice cold."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times, don't know why I haven't bothered to rate it yet. Easily to best Mongolian grill-type restaurant that I've been to - deserving of 5-stars in the Mongolian category. It's quite a drive for me to the nearest Genghis Grill, but worth it. I dine here several time a year and like to bring out of town visitors.  I love their fresh meats - not frozen slices that you need to smash down in your bowl, like virtually every MG restaurant. Has the largest selection of meats, veggies and sauces that I've seen. They now offer three bowl sizes, instead of just one.   On the negative side, they used to have 12 \"recipe\" cards that assisted new visitors on building their bowls, but they've replaced those with newer recipes that aren't nearly as appealing. They've also implemented - inexplicably - a policy of charging a person an additional $4 for going backward through the food line (i.e., to add a item you overlooked, or more of a favorite item). They also could improve on labeling all food items."}
{"text":"Soybeans and lettuce wraps are pretty yummy. It's a like scary the first time you go because you have no one to blame but yourself if you don't like your food considering your the one who adds all your contents from meat, veggies, spices, and sauces. You then let the chefs know what starch you want and they give you a number to put at your table. It's cooked pretty quickly and brought to you. It's a different experience that I think was enjoyable for the whole family."}
{"text":"Rounding up from 3.5 stars.  This place is pretty generous with their servings, and we always have leftovers so the price is decent. I like how you put all your meat and veggies only and they put the carbs on so you don't have to balance a huge bowl piled high with your noodles on top. Don't forget to add an egg. No extra charge! I also appreciate the meat isn't frozen so you can really smash a lot in your bowl. The bowls look small, but trust me, it's a lot of food.  I just wish their udon noodles were a little chewier, but they'll do. You can also choose white rice, fried rice, or even just cabbage.  Don't forget to sign up for their birthday club. You get a free regular sized bowl (they have a small so you are actually getting a medium), no purchase necessary!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for takeout for lunch today since I was craving some Mongolian. This was my first time here and I'm familiar with the concept since I've been to YC's. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.  Pros: - Friendly and helpful hostess - A variety of proteins to choose from  Cons: - My noodles were overcooked and mushy :-( - The sauce was SPICY, it was not marked as spicy. I thought the whole concept of being able to customize your meal is to add spice if you want it. - It took a long time for them to cook it - $12 lunch; noodle bowl and drink. The portion size was mediocre for the price.  Since the cons outweigh the pros, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"DO IT! You get to stuff any sized bowl as much as you want. Be careful how much seasoning you put in your bowl cause you can end up ruining your meal.   Protip: We all like spicy food, but spicy sriracha chicken, with hot seasoning and spicy sauce may end up a little too spicy."}
{"text":"Both times I have been here have been delicious! The waitresses/waiters always explain how it works and how to order food. It's a great environment for families and it's always a great place to grab something quick."}
{"text":"I go there often.  They have changed a few things since it first opened.  I see that some other reviews talk of the lack of shrimp.  They used to have it.....but, not any more. SAD!  Oh well. Get the card and you get a free bowl after I think 10.  I always get it go and its always hot when I get home to eat it.  Maybe get rid of the 3 kinds of fish for some shrimp!  That would be a good move!"}
{"text":"Come here a lot when im in the mood for some stir fry. Always solid food. $2 domestics. They lose a  couple stars because they've been screwing with the experience lately, no longer get to fill ur own sauces and I miss the 1 inch cubes of chicken, much smaller now and now it's precooked? Dafuq?"}
{"text":"Great food, delicious and good variety.  Service was good, we enjoy the lunch here. I choice $12.50 bawl. And stack up that I couldn't finish and have to take home half of the meal."}
{"text":"The girl who greeted us was kind. Then I had to figure out how it worked on my own. Then walked to the begin,explained the size bowl. Small is extremely small. Pricy for a small. Then load as much as I can in the tiny bowl. The people who toss your food to cook are rude,half fell off,who cares I'm just paying $11 for a tiny bowl. Then you just have to figure out what to do next. Do I wait?? Guess not. Go sit they will bring to you. Ok my food was great but I selected it so that was expected. Some things I didn't have in my selection were in my food??. Fiery hot peppers..no thanks. I'm probably not coming back. I'll stick with. YC's get more food for less and they guide you with manners."}
{"text":"Here in Vegas your faced with a choice quantity or quality, this is all about quanity and low quality food. It is a rare find to find both.  The restaurant is understaffed and service was poor. If your have ever been to a Mongolian Grill this definitely feels like the McDonald's of Mongolian grills. It well curb your appetite but leaves alot to be desired"}
{"text":"In short: A lot of fresh ingredients to choose from, and the happy hour ain't too shabby either.  Probably my favorite Mongolian BBQ in the valley.  Best thing I like is the selection, and it's fresh meat not the frozen shaved stuff.  Along with the meats, they have scallops and shrimp, and that ain't too shabby in my opinion.  Then there's a huge collection of veggies , spices, and sauces.  You can play around with the sauces and create some very delicious combinations.  I love the texture of their noodles, chewy but firm.    Atmosphere is pretty nice and the crowd that comes there is pretty chill too.  I love their happy hour, can't beat one dollar well drinks.  I also like the fact that they are open till 10 or 11 on most nights, perfect place to eat after catching a flick at the theater nearby.  They're bit more pricey than other bbq's but I think it's well worth the extra few bucks."}
{"text":"The food here is ok. Service is decent. Realistically, there are several options in this area (ie. Pei Wei or Rumbi) where you can get similar style food that tastes better and wont cost as much. $3+ for an iced tea...$9.99 for a basic, regular sized bowl. I figured it was worth a try...but likely won't be back."}
{"text":"For this airports is really slack on a decent place to have lunch on a layover.... I decided to have a rice bowl I got the Mongolian BarBq ...it was ok taste wise the portion was slacking considering the cost.... And they charge $4.20 for bottle water...wtf....so I got a lemonade fountain drink which was $2.59 for 8oz. Highway robbery!!!"}
{"text":"What a dissapointment. Went there for Son's birthday they were out of both beers  we ordered (Sam Adams and Asahi)and  they had no shrimp or steak on the line. we also had our Granddaughter and she ordered mac and cheese and ot was Kraft out of the Box. I have talked about this before in other reviews. Children are not 2nd class citizens a child's meal should be fit for an adult just smaller. Service was slow as well but they were busy but not sure why. This is a never come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Ghengis Grill and creating our own masterpieces.  We stopped in last night for dinner and they've made some changes.  They now have three sizes of bowls to choose from.  The only size they had before is not Medium, and there a small and large now.  That's fine and we figured that probably pleases more people.  BUT, the big change is that the employees behind the counter at the food line now put the food (meat) in the bowl for you.  You can ask to do it yourself, but you are carefully watched while loading up your bowl.  It just feels uncomforatble and makes you feel like a pig if you are trying to load up your bowl, which is half the fun!  It all tasted good in the end, but it wasn't the same creative dining experience that we used to enjoy."}
{"text":"I have eaten previously throug Uber eats which did not do it justice. I say it was a better experience dining in as you can select your own portions and sample the sauces before selecting them. The staff was very friendly and informative, especially as first time diners, since its different than normal sit in restaurants. The manager was very helpful and nice"}
{"text":"This place is expensive for a quasi self serve food.  The meats were not particularly tender or anything to write home about as far as taste. For a $15 medium bowl I would skip this restaurant and find some place that's a better value, better quality and taste."}
{"text":"Food is great at this restaurant. It was extremely different but fun for us and our kids. You get to pick your meats, sauces and veggies. Therefore, if your food taste bad it is yourrrr fault. We definitely plan to go back to the mongolian grill."}
{"text":"Oh Genghis Grill, why can't you open a location in Northern California yet?  Was in town for spring training this past week and I HAD to stop in at Genghis, as it's one of my favorite restaurants in the area. I used to go in at least once a week for the food and my favorite server/bartender Mike. I was happy to see he was still there when we went in and still giving the impecable service he did when I lived out there. If I could steal him and make him move to Cali, I would. He's that good.  I was shocked when I walked in, because they have completely redesigned this location. I thought it was classy and beautiful. The upgrades they have made seem to be working in their favor.  Go in and ask for Mike if he's working. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"PSH!!!! YC has nothing on Genghi! here are my reasons why:  -fresh, not frozen protein -way better veggie options -seasonings- PURELY genius! i LOVE the option of seasonings, sauces or a mixture of both. genghi's makes all of these options available with my fav section of seasonings -eggs- genius!   and i'm sure this isn't just Genghi's but i love that they'll cook your food in water instead of oil.   $10 for two meals worth of food. i lurve it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!   I was looking for a healthy alternative place to eat hence because I am on a diet and this place serves exactly what I wanted.   You basically get a bowl and you stuff as much as you want of protein, veggies, spices, sauce into this bowl.  When you get to the grill area, someone will ask what kind of starch you would like and there are options from brown rice to noodles.   They grill it for you sauteed in the sauce you chose and serve it to you in a bowl.  It comes w a drink and if you really are a big eater, they have unlimited bowl available too for additional cost!   Great place and I wished they had one in California!"}
{"text":"I have given this place 3 or 4 chances and each time it has gotten worse.  My last visit the server was not very attentive.   When we went to go get the ingredients, the area where they had the meats and veggies. Was so disgustingly dirty like food everywhere and all messy. Some things not fully refilled. So gross. But we still gave it another chance. The food was just ok pretty sure it made us kind of sick afterwards.   Do not come here it's disgusting"}
{"text":"Great food, service, atmosphere. The bar is the perfect place to hangout watching football and drink mimosas! Food is awesome-u choose all your ingredients and it is all fresh not frozen like other mongolian BBQ places. Unlimited refills for around ten bucks, love it!"}
{"text":"Good mongolian bbq - more variety than most. They have some good sauces - Try the mongo bbq or dragon chili."}
{"text":"Been here many time. Bad food experiance today with minimal amount of sympathy from management and staff. Chicken was like pudding texture before cooking and not much better after. Manager explained they were experimenting with a new supplier or something. I should have been offered a discount, free drink or some incentive to come back. I wasn't - and I won't. I'll stick with the Henderson NV location."}
{"text":"This place took forever - the whole wait staff was unprofessional and disgusting in appearance.  I wonder if they even wash their hands... The kitchen staff had nice clothes and wore a smile.  It took 40 minutes to get our food! The food was semi decent but not up to par... Bummer!"}
{"text":"Fun place to create & eat! Our waitress Ri was very pleasant & her customer service was above & beyond. Much appreciated!!! We'll def be back :)"}
{"text":"Great concept the meal was great  The lunch rush really backs up the grill for a slow turn around on your food."}
{"text":"Whoa, can you say Salmonella breeding ground? My sister has been vomiting non stop for the past 2 days eating here. We should have known something was up when the meat is just left out for hours sitting there where anyone could poke and prod it. Then when the food was \"cooked\" a lot of the meat was left raw and greasy. Luckily I chose to just get the vegetables and rice, so I haven't had quite as many problems other than some serious knots in my stomach when I got home. I  do not recommend going here unless you're the Health department coming to shut this place down. Yikes."}
{"text":"We had the Mongo BBQ and the Thai bowl during a layover. The BBQ had a sweet tomato taste which was not very appetizing. The Thai bowl was very bland. Wouldn't recommend going here unless you really want a rice fix."}
{"text":"I've been to Genghis three or four times now, and each time it was delicious.    I feel I have to address a couple of the reviews that have been posted here.  First, there is Nadia's odd review about how \"gross\" for raw meat to be bloody.  Well, last time I checked, meat has blood.  Apparently she prefers frozen meat over fresh meat.  To each her own, but it seems a bit absurd.  Second, Jennifer \"reviewed\" the place without having actually eaten there, which strikes me as a bit closed minded and presumptuous.  I don't have the intuition to be able to judge a restaurant based on bowl size alone, but maybe she is just more talented than I.  On to the actual review... Genghis Grill is great.  Like I said, the meat is fresh, and there are several options: steak, chicken, turkey, pork, sausage, scallops, shrimp, cod, calamari, and probably some that I'm forgetting.  Oh, and did I mention that none of it is frozen?  After the meat, you are hit with a wide array of seasoning selections (Ashley mentioned that she would prefer sauces.  Apparently she didn't realize that there are also sauces at the end.).  Seasonings are necessary because they enhance the flavor, which is something that YC's could use.  My favorite is the Cajun seasoning.  Next you hit a wide variety of vegetables and other knicknacks.  There are almost too many choices; I have a hard time narrowing them down.  It also allows for different combinations; not all of your bowls have to be exactly the same each time.  Finally, you get to the sauces.  These sauces actually have flavor.    You also get a choice of what you want in the bowl with the stir fry; options include noodles and fried rice.    They also have strawberry lemonade, one of the rare restaurants with such an offering.  It is true that this place costs a little more than YC's, but it's worth it.  To those who say the bowl is small, sure, it's smaller than YC's, but when you add the rice or noodles, it fills you up, and you are limited at YC's by how much crap food you can stand to stomach.  There might be better Mongolian BBQs which I don't know about, but this place is legit."}
{"text":"Surprisingly not too shabby! Another Dinner for two under $40 is a win for me and the BF. (Especially when I like to try everything)   This was me and my boyfriends first time here. The waitress will seat you. Around the Restuarant they have bowls to show the sizes you can choose from. Small, medium and large. Your server then brings over the 3 sizes of metal bowls. You then choose your size and explains what you need to do when you choose your meats, veggies and sauces. Our waitress also advised us that we should stack our meats and veggies as high as we can in the bowls.   We chose the medium size bowls. However, I made my decision based on the metal bowls because they looked smaller and thought to myself like girl you're still going to be hungry. Lol. And also thinking that the meat and veggies will shrink, right? But that was why I picked my bowl.   Next you take your bowls to where you pick what you want in your stir fry. For the meats there were a variety of them. Some seasoned and unseasoned Chicken, beef, pork, seafood. After the meats comes the dry seasonings. Anywhere from the usual salt, pepper, garlic to Cheyenne there was quit a few spices. Then you choose your veggies cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, zucchini, broccoli to name a few then lastly you will top all that off with the sauces. They had at least 6 different sauces if I'm not mistaken. Once you choose your sauce, you then take it to the next counter where you can choose your starch which is noodles, white or brown rice. Then they cook your food on this huge round grill. Head to your seat and your waiter brings you your food.  Before I end this, they have a pretty big drink menu and they looked yummy! They do have a bar as well, so you can order a nice little cocktail or beer. And if you don't want that you can grab yourself nice fruity Fresca (we got the raspberry/mandarin Fresca) they have flavored teas or the fountain drink which is that cool coke machine where you can customize your drinks as well. Btw, their non-alcohol drinks like the Fresca is refillable, Yay!   All in all it was good food because you get to pick what you want. The bowls are not too pricey. I will say, I underestimated those metal bowls because after you stack the meats and veggies then add noodles and rice the portions were HUGE for me. So I'll opt for the small next time. And another thing that they failed to mention is to not go crazy with the spices and sauces. Keep it simple because you'll end up with a big ol' salty mess. I learned that from another review and I'm glad I read it because you can easily make this the worst experience if you get a little sauce crazy!"}
{"text":"I was insanely disappointed with this place. I love Mongolian BBQ's, but his one was nothing like any of the others that I have been to. The hostess was very confused about where to seat my friend and I, and then several servers walked by us before one stopped and asked if we had been helped. It was busy, so I get it. Then we were given little, tiny bowls to make our meat/veggie/sauce selections, and they add noodles or rice for you. I found that incredibly unusual for this type of restaurant, so I suppose I just don't like the concept. The meat/veggie counter was very messy, with spills and stray pieces of meat/veggies all lover. Also, I feel like if you are going to limit the bowl size, the price should be much lower.  I could go to another Mongolian BBQ and get twice the food for the same price. The food itself was pretty good, although the seafood was a bit fishy. Overall, I was very disappointed. I probably will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Great concept (I love Mongolian grills in general) but it was kind of expensive for the quality.  The rice was overcooked, the fish I chose tasted odd and they don't clean off the grill between cooking so my roommate's food tasted fishy even though she had beef.  Not a huge concern except that she's allergic!  The wait staff was really friendly but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"These guys are fantastic! Gave us a small sample a couple days ago, loved it so came back today! Customer service great, clean, friendly and great food"}
{"text":"The Bomb! Make your own Bowl! Defriggin licious! Recommend when you're really hungry or not!"}
{"text":"I love mongolian bbq. It's a simple process which is what I really enjoy most about it. But I don't get this place. Their process is super complicated. There are different sizes with different prices, and if you get more than one serving then you pay extra. We were all confused. Even our friends that have gone there before, were confused.You fill out a card, then hand it over once you've gathered all of your ingredients. You hand over your card and sit down. Then they bring your food to you. I feel this removes the whole mongolian bbq experience of watching them cook your food right in front of you. That's one of the reasons that attracts people to mongolian bbq, and they completely got rid of it. And they had super small containers for all the ingredients, which they had to keep refilling. Their whole process just seemed extremely inefficient. And they had have way too many people to work due to this inefficient process. It just doesn't make any sense to me. Granted the food was good and they had different flavored sauces and seasonings, but I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Food tasted funny didn't finish my meal. Only thing I ate that day and shortly after couldn't stop throwing up. 100% food poising. So gross."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my experience here. They have a KILLER happy hour, probably one of the best around. I think it was like $3 for well cocktail and the reverse happy hour started at 8- SCORE. The Mongolian grill portion is good and quick. You can choose from 3 different sized bowls to fill up with meats and seafood, yes they are all in the same refrigerated section and the scallops were frozen ( what quality do you expect from all-you-can-fill seafood for $10?!), a huge assortment of veggies and sauces. I was most impressed by the happy hour and attentiveness of the bartender. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out, I'd heard nothing but good things about it from friends in other cities. Sadly, I was a bit disappointed.   First off, the tables are WAY TOO close together, and some are placed in the most awkward and ridiculous spots. So we sat down, ordered an appetizer, and then got our instructions to fill our little bowl up at the bar with meats and veggies. I thought this would be a fun experience, it was not. We started with the meats, which were completely raw. I know it gets all cooked together, but just the thought of it and the fact that the raw meat is so close to the other food items just irked me out.  So I put some raw chicken and raw steak bits in.  They tell you at the beginning to \"load it high\" with veggies but it just becomes annoying as you make this little mountain of veggies that keep toppling all over the place, not to mention the glass casing makes it nearly impossible to grab veggies from the other side..ugh it was just annoying.  Then we get to the sauces, which like others have said, look like all the same high fructose corn syrupy goodness. We chose our starch (I got brown rice, my friend got noodles) and went back to our table.    The bowls came out fairly quickly, yet still no appetizer.  The appetizer finally showed up when we had nearly finished...I almost wanted to ask if the server could just take it back.  Anyhow, the food was meh.  I tried my friend's noodles and they were absolutely awful, please don't opt for those. They were flavorless and a strange consistency.  I feel like I could make the same dishes at home fairly easily and much much healthier.    One last thing, when we got our bill, we noticed it had charged us the price for the \"unlimited\" bowls, when we'd each had just one. We asked the server about this and she said that that's the only way the bowls are charged, but pointed out a credit at the bottom where we were each credited $2 for not doing the unlimited. Seems like a strange, unnecessary way to do the billing (??).  I don't think I'll be back here, if I want a healthy bowl of rice, chicken, and veggies I can just make it at home.  If I want an authentic Mongolian BBQ, I'll go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food was great but our server was terrible. Went with a friend and it was both of our first time, the server made no effort to explain anything or ask if we needed anything even once during the entire meal. No offers for refills until we were done eating then dissapeared to behind the bar for another 20minutes before asking if we needed boxes.   I would avoid this location like the plague."}
{"text":"Awkward is the best way to describe the servers and the expectations of a tip by the servers when they did nothing except bring a bowl to my table. The system needs to be fixed. Even refills on the drinks are self serve, yet the servers expect a 20% tip.   On the good side , the food was good and was cooked correctly . Just hating feeling uncomfortable when I tip as though it's s buffet 1 or 2 bucks a person and having to worry next time I go in there the way I am viewed."}
{"text":"I seem to be one of the few who had never gone to YC's prior to going here...and thankfully in my opinion Genghis is far superior. The night I went to YC's might have been badly chosen due to the car show, but unfortunately is was completely packed, and though I have no problems with people packing their bowls to the gills and  enjoying that all you can eat experience I really didn't care much for the quality of the food and the limited choice of rice as well as the fact that their meats were frozen and shaved....on the other hand my girlfriend and I were a bit tired of heading to Chipotle as much as we love it and decided to try it out. I'll admit that I could give it 5 stars (on the food alone) but several factors do come into play. I find the seating partially awkward. Against the wall you have people sort of gazing down on you if you choose a table and then the TV screens for those who care to watch a game,etc while eating seem to be placed too high. On a good note, you have a larger selection of rice and noodles than YC's and the meats are more appetizing as well as the veggies. I also liked the numerous sauces offered though I'm a pretty vanilla type sauce person myself. The service can be a bit awkward in my previous visits with refills indeed taking some time and I have to feel bad for the waiters who have a limited amount of work to do since clients basically choose their own menu barring some dessert choices that I haven't nor may I ever choose to take. All in all it was my first \"Mongolian grill\" experience and left me impressed and more than willing to give it a thumbs up to friends and strangers alike."}
{"text":"Just cannot compare to YC's. Pretty expensive for very small portions and also confusing for our first time. No one really offered any help to any of my questions except by meeting them with confusion. Guys at the grill were very nice but man behind the counter and waitstaff around the line didn't offer much help. Food was okay and sauce tasted too sweet for a sauce I intended to be salty. Only positive was Michael waiting on us at our table, he was very friendly and went up and above to offer us whatever we needed. If Michael worked at YC's i would never stop eating there."}
{"text":"It was our first time and we stopped in for a quick bite rather than a big meal. It's one of those places that you need to learn what you do and don't want in your mixtures. My husband wasn't thrilled with his choices but felt the quality was good. I had potstickers and they were pretty good. Our server was pleasant. We would be willing to try it again.  Side note: I appreciate that they calories are readily available on the menu!"}
{"text":"Literally just finished our food from here and WOW! We moved out here from California and have a hard time finding good food places around here but this is one of them! The meats and veggies are so fresh ! Staff is rad as well! The girl at the bar was so sweet! Can not wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Usually when I go to one of these Mongolian wok type places, I leave with a box and a half to go. On the other hand, this one was more expensive and I was still hungry by time I left. The bowl was tiny, the sides were limited, and the sauces were pre-made, pasty, 'meh'. In addition to that, the service was terrible. My drink didn't get refilled even once, and my friend's food sat on the line for ten~fifteen minutes before they decided to bring it over to her. And the restaurant was pretty much empty other than our table, and two or three others, so it's not like they were super busy or something. There was a group of waiters standing around the entire time, chatting obnoxiously loud and basically ignoring us, while one other girl did all the work.   Pro's: Fresh ingredients, large variety of FRESH meats (a lot of these types of places do frozen), decent spice section, high quality ingredients in general, clean/pretty restaurant.   Con's: Way overpriced. Tiny portion sizes. (The bowl was shockingly small to begin with, when I got it. And then it was obviously designed to have a really thick bottom to make it even shallower, as well as a wide brim - which is cheap on the restaurants part, and kind of tasteless, in my opinion.) Lackluster sauces. Horrible service. Oh, and this is more of a personal preference, but they only had udon noodles and two rice types for what you wanted as your 'side', i.e the thing mixed into your stir-fry. Everything else was atypical stuff like tortilla strips and things of that nature. Not to hate on fusion foods or anything, but if I'm going to get Asian food, I'd like more Asian selections, haha.   These Mongolian Grill restaurants are always expensive. However, it's because you're paying for the fact that you get to eat a huge amount of food. I mean, it's just stir-fry. It's rice and vegetables for the most part. Yummy? Yes. High cuisine? Not so much. Worth sit-down prices? In this case, definitely not.  There aren't a lot of Mongolian places in AZ, but this one is at the bottom of the totem pole, in my opinion. I suggest heading elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great location! Pretty busy on a Saturday night probably because of the asu game. They changed things since the last time I was here about 4 months ago. Now they give you these \"name cards\" where u write your name and just give it to the cooks. Guess I don't mind that much I got food much faster that way. I was pretty excited about making my shrimp bowl till I read the sign they just added stating that they are currently going thru a Shrimp shortage at the moment. You don't even get to sample the sauces any longer. That was another cool thing I loved about this place. WTF I was truly disappointed. Also I felt a little rushed. Not even ten minutes after I received my food the waitress handed me the bill. Not as pleased this time but I guess I'll give then another shot. Hopefully next time they'll have shrimp!"}
{"text":"I can't exactly review the food because we walked in, sat down and then perused the grill line and walked out.  I thought the size of the bowl was extremely small for the price and I just wasn't that impressed.  I've always loved YC's and appreciate that you can select your bowl size AND the price includes a drink.    I just didn't like the vibe here, maybe it was just me, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food. the meat is all fresh and not frozen then shaved to little protein flakes.  Twice the variety of yc's, including shrimp, calamari, steak, marinated whitefish and all the veggies you can think of. Best happy hour anywhere. The 1-5 specials are ridiculous.  YC's blows genghis!  play your cards right and you can leave full, buzzed, and with a golf lesson for less than 20 bucks! hooray for kitten mittens!"}
{"text":"Great food..our server Jenn was awesome. It was our first time there and she explained everything. Good value!"}
{"text":"This place was good.  Typicall Mongolian BBQ although a bit pricey.  The location for this place is really good because it gets alot of foot traffic so you will see this place packed at almost all times.  I like this place better then its competitors in AZ because it caters to the nightlife eaters with Sake bombs and other drink specials.  The selection of meat and vegetables is great and you will find yourself stuck between making several dishes.  I think that if they droped the price of the all you can eat, people would be happier as they would make smaller portions of different things...but right now it feels like everyone crams as much as possible into one bowl.  I recommend this place, but its nothing you have to rush out to right this instant."}
{"text":"This location is horrible! One its winter and cold as heck inside with all the fans going full blast, two there's nothing like gangster rap music playing loud as hell, then to top it off almost all the food bins were empty. We ordered our water and lemonade and only waited 15 minutes for it and the place was 20% full. This is one location we will never come back to plus it was pretty dirty around food area. Not sure why we even stayed"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a Mongolian BBQ locally since I moved here.  We were just driving down Stephanie near Sunset when we spotted Genghis Grill.  What a pleasant surprise.  Only open a few days the service was well trained which was surprising. You can order appetizers and desserts but the main attraction is the BBQ.  After giving you two silver dishes you fill the larger one with your meats and seafood and then load it up with vegetables.  Be sure to add a lot of them as they will cook down quite a bit.  Next you fill the small bowl with your choice of flavor sauces with everything from flavorful to spicy.  After this you take your bowls to the BBQ where you have your choice of rices, noodles, pasta and even surprisingly tortillas.  You can watch them cook up your own concoction or they will deliver it to your table.    Our experience wasn't perfect. Our drink was watery and for some reason they said they were out of edamame appetizers which considering they had been open only two days seemed like the had few bugs to work out.    Overall we plan on going back soon.  While not cheap the meal was tasty, filling and served piping hot."}
{"text":"Always solid.. However they didn't have all the sauces and didn't seem to want to replace them. Seems service is slacking as well since they got those touch screens."}
{"text":"Dear Friends who work at Genghis grill....you have seen me three times this week and although I am slightly burned out on your delicious Americanized \"Mongolian\" BBQ I must admit that you have become my new favorite mall fast food.  If you are unfamiliar with choosing your own adventure so to speak, it is a pretty good idea to go mild the first time and go easy on the complexity of your chosen dish.  My Fiancee and I are quite familiar with this sort of food and as such went hog wild and went for broke when piling up the topping and experimenting with the vast combinations of delicious entrees.  Here is our critique.  The Bad;  While overall delicious the sea food selection could use some work, scallops were very fishy (gross) calamari was still frozen, and the shrimp was bland and tasteless.  Took way too long to get both of our meals, one arrived well before the other all three times (read between 5 and 10 minutes) this is dissapointing  as it intrudes onto our date time as one of our meal ends up cold.  The Good;  Steak and Chicken seemed fresh not frozen (although couldnt be sure) tasted pretty good for an inexpensive meal.  Noodles and rice were fantastic!  Terryaki Sauce and Garlic Sauce were a touch salty but again very good all things considering  Staff were very friendly polite, and speedy.  No wait times on drinks or to be seated even when it was quite crowded.   Overall room for improvement but still quite a good little meal if your waiting for a movie.  We will be back several times I am sure."}
{"text":"This place is great and allows you to eat what you like and as much or little as you would like. I love this place and frequent it often. Great for large parties"}
{"text":"Jessica R is the best. I really appreciate what great service she gave to us. The food is yummy as always but the service was the best."}
{"text":"No need to go over the setup of the restaurant as millions have told the story in their reviews but just wanted to say you cant go wrong here,want a little meat all veggies cool all meat no sauce cool all sauce an egg whatever you want your choice,all the ingredients I partook in were fresh and tasted great,all the employees i encountered were awesome and it was as clean as a whistle in there,hit all the check marks for me as the terminator said i'll be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times, there are many options for meat selection and the food was really tasty."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  I've been to many Mongolian grills before, but this tops them all.  Truly excellent selection of meats, vegetables, sauces.  Really nice dining format too.  You are seated like a normal restaurant, then you walk through a buffet style area to fill up your bowl with as much as you'd like, drop it off at the grill, and then they bring it to you.  As of this writing they've only been open about three months, but the people were already streaming in at 5pm!  It looks to be a franchise based on the quality of the environment and the whole dining process.  Very friendly and informative staff.  I'm already looking forward to going again.  Prices are great too...about $10, plus you can go with a \"bottomless\" bowl for only an extra $3.  Wide drink selection."}
{"text":"Brief update: District Manager Robbie called me and we spoke at length about my concerns regarding the Glendale location. I appreciated his time and for listening to me. I do think he will do something to address the issues.  Also Tommy got promoted - yea!!!"}
{"text":"I see all these bad reviews and I am wondering if I went to the same place!?! I mean, its create your own bowl, if you don't like it, it's kinda YOUR OWN FAULT!  Ok so this is a Mangolian style bbq place where you load up your raw ingredients and then give it to a chef to cook. The options are endless. Chicken, steak, pork, ham, sausage, turkey, fish, shrimp, calamari, crab (imitation), and I am sure I missed something. Then you hit veggies. Stir fry, classic, pretty much everything you could think of. Then sauce. Kung Pao, Teryiaki, Curry, sweet, spicy, you name it! I think there are 8 different ones. You also have numerous spices, and herbs to add. If you can't decide, there are recipe card suggestions like Firecracker shrimp, Teriyaki Bowl, and Kung Pao chicken. For $11.99 you can fill your bowl once, if you are still hungry, add $4 for AYCE. Pile your bowl high because the veggies do decrease when they cook. Also, there are 3 appetizers. Lettuce wraps, edamame, and pot stickers. I prefer the potsticker, cooked well.  They have a full bar that I have yet to take advantage of. The servers don't do much, but they are always treating us like gold. Until this place shows a bad health grade, I will continue to be a regular here."}
{"text":"ALWAYS love the food.  This location is a little more difficult to maneuver (tons of college kids), but that is ok if you aren't starving and can wait a bit.  Took my 5 year old at her request and we had such a lovely time.  The staff are great and treat everyone well.  Even a slightly hyper kiddo who wants to chat with everyone.  People watching is great, the food is always just what you want, and the drinks are top notch."}
{"text":"Love me some Genghis Grill.  Always exactly what I want, because I get to pick exactly what I want.  It is flavorful, cooked to perfection and the staff is always great.  They always have a pair of chop stick helpers for my little one so she can feel like a chop stick pro.    I highly recommend taking your kids here.  My girl tends to eat more veggies or try new things when she can see it before it is cooked, and see other people trying it too."}
{"text":"In all fairness to the reader and to this establishment, let me start out by saying I did not actually end up eating at this place.  Read on to find out why...  I LOVE mongolian stir-fry places - all of the cooking without having to buy the ingredients, clean up afterwards, etc. - so I was completely stoked to go to this place.  Unfortunately, after trudging through the rain this past Sunday night to get there, Genghis Grill was not the oasis I had hoped for.  I stepped out of the rain and into an equally dreary locale with lights that somehow gave the place a weird cafeteria-like aura.  The only way to describe the atmosphere is to say there is no atmosphere.  The grilling area, which you'd think would be the main focal point of a place called Genghis Grill, was all the way in the back and was completely deserted.  NO ONE was actually filling bowls up with food or having stuff grilled, which made me wonder how long all of the ingredients had been sitting there.    Averting my gaze from the sad cooking area, my eyes fell upon a random assortment of questionably groomed older people, with the odd straggly haired teenager thrown into the mix.  And why the flat-screen tvs on the walls?  It's not that I don't appreciate nice flat-screen tvs, but at a mongolian barbeque they just seemed a little...out-of-place.  The whole scene was just unappetizing, so we decided to go and find a more appealing place to dine (namely, Chipotle, which incidentally had a lot more atmosphere and was not deserted).  The comic relief was when I told the waiter we had \"to go,\" and he replied \"Oh, you can pick that up at the bar\" - to which I clarified \"No- I mean we're leaving.\"  Probably never to return, unless I come to hear that maybe this was just an \"off\" night for the Genghis Grill..."}
{"text":"We want to like Genghis Grille more than we do and have stopped here every so often hoping it will get better. It hasn't been very busy since their crazy opening over a year ago.  The food is good. You get to select which veggies you want, cooked with the protein of your choice. FYI, when you start building your dish, you need to decide what goes well with what. Too much sauce and everything becomes sloppy. Too little and everything comes out dry.   Soft drinks and items from the bar are higher than you would expect. Clearly a profit margin for them. Our bill runs about $15 or so a person and seems rich given the ever shrinking bowls.  It's sad when a franchisee (I'm guessing) buys a business and then just ignores their investment and becomes absentee. Several Yelp'ers have written extensively about the poor service and the wait staff talking on their cell phones and ignoring the customers.  We echo these experiences and will take a pass going forward.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"I like this place because you get to create your own concoctions without having to actually spend all the time prepping and cooking it!!   I've been here twice and while yes it's not gourmet, it's still really good.  I think it's a great lunch spot and it seems to always be packed at lunch time. First time I went in I was worried about the freshness but it always looks really good. Nothing looks old or stale etc. So big props on what they are doing here.   Be mindful of what you're doing when you mix sauces, spices, etc. I haven't had anything turn out badly yet though.    Also the service here has always been impeccable!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I love all the choices for your veggies and meats as well as sauces and starch. So many varieties and options to pick from.  Relatively affordable and kid friendly! Recommend for quick easy and healthy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I love Genghis! The service is always good and the food is regularly restocked so I've never seen them out of any of the mix-ins.   You definitely have to know what flavors taste good together or otherwise, do rely on one of the standard bowl options as it really affects the experience!"}
{"text":"BYOB - Build your own bowl- So at the persistent nagging of my friend to check this place out i finely obliged. The seating area could use some sprucing up, looks like they put yard sale furniture to decorate. Oh well on the food. I went for the regular bowl and my friend coached me into the building process. I picked out chicken,pork and beef along with some bellpeppers and other goods.  The dudes that take your bowl and cook had blank looks on their faces which was kinda disturbing they didn't greet me tell me what my # was nothing. Any who grabbed our drinks and sat down to wait for the chow. It was pretty good but not phenomenal, usually they have these build a bowl stations at some Asian buffets. The price tag was a bit steep for what they give you. The hostess gals were nice, service was prompt. Probably won't make a habit out of visiting here unless it's one someone else's dime. Their portion to price ratio is a little skewed for my taste."}
{"text":"Last night was my 2nd Genghis Grill experience.  My first experience was at Tempe Marketplace a year or so ago and I made my bowl almost too spicy to eat.  I vowed to return for another stab at it but my 2nd trip wasn't much better.  I find this place to be way too complicated.  The ingredients look fresh and plentiful, but:  - how much of those powders and salts should I include? - do I crack the egg myself or bring them to the grilling station and have the chef do it for me? - how much of the sauce should I put in the cup as to not have my dish overly spicy or overly sauced?  I much prefer YC's.  They don't have the array of ingredients, but the whole experience is better.  You get a bigger bowl, soup, ice cream, refill your own soda, and somehow your bowl is ready 10 minutes faster than at Genghis.  Plus the sauces aren't as heavy so you can pretty much guess how much to put in your bowl.  Well I guess a plus to Genghis is that they have alcohol and from the looks of it some pretty good happy hour specials....$1 saki anyone?  However, on this trip, we received excellent service.  I'm guessing he was the owner or manager.  Anyway, he was awesome and friendly.  He looked like Danny McBride which was a plus."}
{"text":"Not your regular Genghis grill where you get to pick and choose your ingredients. They have a limited menu but still a good option compared to what you get in airports. The food is freshly made and served hot. Had the chicken teriyaki bowl which was well made. The portions were generous and I walked away happy."}
{"text":"I've only done take out here. Can't speak to the table service. Food is good. Got a small and split it. We were stuffed. I did find it odd that I heard them offering other people egg & that was never offered to me. Not sure why. We enjoyed the food. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Food was great. But as someone who suffers from anxiety, i feel its very insensitive and rude to question a customer when they requested the table next to the one i was offered, we were going to be seated directly next to a party when there was plenty of open tables. I really shouldn't be challenged by the hostess asking rudely \"well what's your issue with this table?\" I brought my husband here to enjoy a nice lunch and am leaving with a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is some of the most interesting and delicious food I've had in a LONG time. You get seated, then go up and load up your bowl. Many different meat choices, lots of veggies, and some very tasty sauces. Your food is cooked on a big grill, and normally comes out very quickly. The staff is always very nice to me. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"YUMMY! first time i've been here and i'm so glad i did! upon walking in, the restaurant is nice and clean and the staff are extremely welcoming! my friends and i were seated pretty quickly and the server came and explained to us how it works.  so you're given three sizes, a small, medium or a large. you're then given a bowl and a receipt and you walk up to a salad bar-ish place where you pile on your proteins, veggies, and sauce. the meats and the veggies look fresh and some of the meats even has marinade in it already! there as an option of chicken, shrimp, pork and beef- lots of pick from!! plus side of this is they have the calories on the tag as well for people who are calorie conscious! then you walk up to the chefs, pick your grains or noodles, hand them your receipt and then they cook it for you and deliver it to your table!  i like this place because if you're on a low carb diet, you can still make it work to your benefit and if you're on a paleo diet, it still works as well since you get to choose what goes in your bowl! my friends and i got the large and it is enough to take home! wayyyy better than other fast food chinese/mongolian places since you control what goes in your bowl.   all in all, i am going to come back here again when i'm craving chinese/mongolian food!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for my free birthday bowl  for lunch. Oh so delicious! I went with spicy chicken, scallops and assorted veggies with udon noodles and some chicken potstickers. Always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Food is good. Price is high. Service is weak. I've been here a few times and each time the service is just meh. Today my boyfriend and I ordered it to go. The guy making the food was very nice and helpful. The bar staff was slow and unfriendly. We had to pay at the bar and they ignored us for 10 minutes even after we asked if we could be helped. They acted like they were extremely busy but there was hardly anyone there.. Need to train and hire better staff."}
{"text":"Great service; our server checked in us several times and offered us drinks, apps, and desert.  The manager also came by our table. The food was fresh and the buffet area was very clean. Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"yummy food, good drink specials, and friendly service!"}
{"text":"My family is obsessed with this place! Servers are always great (although they don't have to do a lot since you are the one making the food)! Vegetables and proteins always look really fresh and there's a really great variety. There are about a billion sauce options, but I think the 3G sauce is the best (it's got a good kick)! Also, consider getting the udon noodles as your starch; they are so good!"}
{"text":"I love the food. And I know why. I created it. The only thing I don't like about this place is the mess in the area where you create your food. There should be one employee who goes through the line to clean up messes. People try to overpack the bowl and spill it EVERYWHERE!!! Thats my only complaint."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving a 2 is the server was amazing.   The food is horrible. Nowhere near a real Mongolian grill. I did see an wide selection of food the shove in that tiny bowl ( wich was dirty ). There were no oils to cook the food in. There was no way to cook  the flavor in the meat. Everything came out bland. The udon noodles tasted like spaghetti so my first bowl tasted like a wanna be Asian pasta dish. I tried a second bowl to see If maybe I did something wrong. I spiced the crap out of the meat with the dry ingredients and filled the little ramekin up with the sauces I thought would go well and tried rice. It came out bland and kinda tasted like the first bowl. It was just a horrible experience. I will not go back."}
{"text":"We took my mom here for her BDay and Danielle was awesome as usual, I just love this place!!! Food was/is awesome as usual.....this is what Danielle fixed for my mom and it was so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg so delicious. Didn't understand it at first, but once explained it made sense. The food is amazing. And you definitely get what you pay for. Best thing to me, is that you get to put what veggies you personally like rather than other places where it's already prepped. Completely amazing"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight.  I didn't really have high expectations of this place before trying it for the first time but afterwards I am now a big fan! All the staff were very attentive, my waiter Brett was friendly and checked in on me almost a little too much. Seriously though I received much better service here than I have at some of the premier restaurants on the strip.   The food area was regularly cleaned and restocked. All the food was fresh looking and cooked thoroughly. Lots of choices when it came to meats, veggies and the sauces.  Only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was that when giving my uncooked bowl of food to grill master to cook, he asked what starch I wanted and I said brown rice.  When my food was cooked and delivered to me though, udon noodles had been given to me instead of brown rice.  I am not a picky eater and I was hungry and had dived right in. It actually took me a few bites to realize the error.  I'm not one to complain or send things back unless it's really a grievous error and I didn't want to go through the process of collecting everything again and waiting for it to be cooked so I just shrugged it off and kept on eating.  Big screen TV in there was nice as well as I dined alone tonight.   Dinner bowls are $10.99 + drinks (alcohol is avail). You can pay $3 extra for a bottomless (all you can eat) bowl, but honestly if you pile your first bowl high enough, only football players in training should need to go back for seconds.  I will come back again"}
{"text":"Ummm. No. We have normally always gone to YCs, but figured we would try this place as it is closer to our house. we will continue going back to YCs! This place was very pricey (almost $14 for adult bowl... $12 for my kids bowls), the meats were thawed and really it just wasn't great. The meat being thaw is the worst, slopping around raw chicken and beef is gross... especially as everyone in front of and behind you is slopping all the juice everywhere. The sauces were extremely thick like BBQ sauce and the bowls (we had 4 between all of us) all generally lacked flavor. We found out that they cook the food and add the sauce at the very end. So.. essentially it's cooked in water and then sauce of your choice splashed on after for a little flavor. It tasted as such, it sucked. They have impeccable portion control as they don't allow you any access to the noodles and the bowls for veggies and meat are tiny. Most Mongolian places constantly stir the food on super high heat, this place dumps your food on the grill with 10 other people's and mostly lets it sit until cooked. So I had burned meat in my bowl. YCs is hands down better. I can only imagine the people on here who claim this place is better than YCs must be drawing a paycheck from genghis grill. We were actually a little mad after eating, we won't be back.  Pros- place was clean lol."}
{"text":"I came to this place for the first time about a month ago. My brother brought me here because he loves it. And can I say AMAZING. I love eating here. I've been back there 2 times already and I feel like it only gets better. The portions they serve are phenomenal. I always leave with a to-go box and I end up enjoying it for lunch the next day. Even heated up the food is amazing the next day. The wait is never too long. I went one time when it was busy and it took them maybe 10-15 minutes, which is amazing considering there was no more space to drop your food off to have it cooked!  Also, the pot stickers are to die for.   I've recommended this place to everyone I know. Wonderful job to the staff!"}
{"text":"What a treat!  I have never been to any place like the Genghis Grill. I have to admit, the name and the outward appearance of this restaurant really made me not want to take that leap of faith - but I am glad I did!  Not to mention it's great for everyone, vegan, lactose-intolerant, celiac & vegetarian friendly!  Woo hoo!  The first time is sensory overload.  Most people turn their inner Poke'mon freaks on and turn gotta catch em all on the food but the best advice I can give you is to calm down, deep breaths.  There is A LOT to choose from and the staff will walk you through it if you are a first timer.  Also a good clue is to watch the folks around you who look like regulars.  They know what they are doing.  You start with a seemingly small bowl - but don't worry.  This is not what you're finish product will be served in.  There are recipe cards at the beginning of the line and everyone thinks that if you use one of those you are wimping out - NOT TRUE.  They are there for a reason, because they have been perfected.  I recommend starting with one and adding your own touches as you go along.  It goes in order - protein, spices, veggies, salsas, eggs, miscellaneous, etc.  At the end you will come to the Sauce Buffet.  Be warned here as well, the first time I went I filled my sauce ramekin to the BRIM because I thought, well the cup is this big so I guess they want me to fill it to the top.  NOT the logic here.  My bowl was swimming in sauce.  I would fill it a little over half way with whatever dressing you choose.  Next you wrap up the excitement by walking over to the grill and telling them what kind of starch you would like (white rice, friend rice, noodles, etc.) This is also the part where you let them know if you have ANY allergies and they will cook yours on a separate grill - amazing.  In exchange they will give you a numbered card that you take back to your table while you drool like a St. Bernard while you wait anxiously and suffer with every waitress/waiter that walks by with a red bowl - just praying that the next one is yours.  Overall we had a ton of fun here and it gets better every time!  Quick, easy, cheap.  What is there not to like?!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience I love mongolian food It was cooked perfectly and very taste full I tried the Nutella wonton ice cream and I don't normally eat Nutella but it was great a lot of great flavors all around great meal just a little on the pricey side but great experience"}
{"text":"Just tried to go here for dinner. We were seated quickly since it wasn't busy, yet after 10 minutes we had to ask one of the waitresses to have our order taken. She said she was going to get our server, didn't even ask if we wanted drinks. Whoever was supposed to serve our table never showed, after another 5 to 10 minutes. Ended up leaving and going elsewhere. There's plenty of other places here in Tempe marketplace."}
{"text":"Blah and yuck! Basically a buffet."}
{"text":"Ok I know it's in an airport. But this was by far the most flavor less, bland Asian food I've ever had! Bland and Asian rarely go together.  But this food had NONE. Let me be specific. I ordered the Beef bowl. They claim it was marinated. But in what? Must have been water. While I don't claim to be a salt a holic, this food was devoid of any salt whatsoever. Even adding salty soy sauce didn't help much.  So IF you must eat at the Charlotte airport, just go next door to the Carolina BBQ place which is FAR better! Or really any other place other than Blando Grill."}
{"text":"It's a chain, but it's definitely unique.  I was under the impress that you would tell the chef what you want and they cook it in front of you.  You actually go through a buffet style line and select your ingredients, ranging from raw chicken, steak, and shrimp, to all kinds of vegetables to the seasoning and sauce.  You bring your bowl up to the grill and then you tell them what kind of starch (rice, noodles, etc) and they throw it on a giant grill.  I got chicken with ginger seasoning, a plethora of veggies and pineapple, honey soy sauce, and udon noodles.  The veggies were mostly fresh but the chicken was slightly tough.  The flavor combination went very well together though.  There is some table service here; a waiter will take and refill your drink order.  Also, once you give them your food to cook, you can sit and wait for them to bring it to you.  They have some beer including a few imports as well as sake, wine, and margaritas.  They have some desserts as well, but I would have liked to have seen a spring roll or some other sides.  Still for $10 dinner price, this was a large and healthy meal.  You can also pay an extra $4 and get as many bowls as you want ($2 for lunch).  I will definitely go back here.  I like making stir fry's at home, but I always find I am missing something.  That's not the case here.  They have just about anything you've ever had in a stir fry."}
{"text":"The food tastes great. They don't have a limit on how high you can stack food in your bowl. It's a balancing act for some.  I wish they had recommendations readily available for people who don't know a lot about spices.  The reason for 3 stars? They staff takes FOREVER to get things done. Asks three people for a box for leftovers before I actually got one. Once I asked for a check I got it about 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"First time here. Unfortunately I will not be back. Since it was our first time, my husband and I decided to play it safe by ordering the pre made bowls. I got the honey walnut chicken and he got the mandarin orange. Mine was bland, burnt and the veggies raw. I could only eat a few bites. I tried his, and it tasted like frozen orange juice mix. They offered to replace my bowl, but I didn't want anything else. At least the alcohol was good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here, maybe not as much as YC's, but enough to get me back if I'm in the area - looks like there are three more locations coming soon, so I'd probably do one of those, since the Tempe Marketplace is always crazy busy.  There was a pretty good sized meat selection, including marinated steak, which I chose. For seasoning, there were some pretty tempting choices, and I went with a couple shakes of black pepper, citrus garlic herb, and crushed red pepper. Peppers, onions, tomatoes, carrots, and surprisingly potatoes went on next, followed by some mongo barbecue, Szechuan, and honey soy sauces, and noodles.  The carrots were maybe a little too thick and crunchy, not quite cooked through, but other than that, everything was all good.  The bowl was a little small (you don't put the noodles on yourself, so you don't need a huge bowl), but I think I managed to get a decent sized meal into it. I probably could have put a little more meat in there, but I'll remember that for next time.  Personally, I prefer the YC's experience, just because it's simpler, faster, and gives you a little more food for a little less money. But I don't have any complaints about this place."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place when it first opened.  Ate here so much that the manager recognized me, and I eventually got burned out on it.  There was only one question they would ask: \"One trip through or all you can eat for just a bit more???\"  I always got the all you can eat because I'd rather try 3 small combinations of ingredients than one big one. Then eventually they started screwing around with bowl size.  Stupid, but whatever. Today I went in, and it had been awhile since my last visit, and apparently there is no longer an all you can eat option.  I was about to just leave, but I had earned enough points over the years to get a free bowl so I figured I might as well use it up. I've never been to a Mongolian BBQ that was not all you can eat until today, and I have been to quite a few. Now, don't get me wrong, everyone here has always been really cool.  And the ingredients have always been really good and fresh.  (And for those of you who posted on here that you're worried about \"cross contamination\", you're a bit dumb.  You're worried about raw ingredients touching the veggies by accident on the buffet line???  Well, what do you think happens when you put it all in a bowl?!?!  Ultimately it ALL goes onto a really hot grill and gets cooked.)  Anyways...... I'm giving it two stars just because over the years the overall value has been steadily decreasing, and I probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place rock you pick your m sets the all your  veggies , sauce and spices and they grill it all up for you. The food and choices are great. Staff is friendly, place is clean. The got a bar so they serve alcohol which is a plus. They are super busy at lunch hours during the week. Highly recommended try this place!"}
{"text":"This place should be great.  It is a chain and I've eaten at other ones - but this place is just to busy and poorly run.  The service is sporadic and the erratic.   The proteins in the food bar were frozen.  The kitchen keeps the restaurant open and maybe on slow nights this place is still a go to for midweek ethnic food - but on weekends stay away.   We got our appetizer after our entree."}
{"text":"We took the whole family, 11 of us, ranging from four years old to high 80s. Alyssa gave us the best service ever. Everything was delicious,  and the service was prompt, officiant, and friendly."}
{"text":"Took a buddy to lunch here last month.  Surprised to get there around 11:30 and be the only ones there...  The food was great, as was the service.  Looking forward to my next meal here the next time I pass through Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place 1 star since 0 is not available. My party and I walked in along with another party as the hostess walked up 2 people walked in without asking she grabbed 2 menus and told them to follow her. When asked why she didn't ask who was here first  she ignored us and walked away. Noodles & Company is a short walk away."}
{"text":"The chicken was horrifying. Not sure if it was still raw or what, but it tasted like slimy soft rubber. Vomit-worthy. I pushed all the chicken to one side of my bowl and ate everything else. The bowl was great besides the main part of my dish. *sigh* I tried some of the steak from my boyfriends bowl, which was fantastic. The service was sub-par. There was only one other table in the whole place, and our server was never to be found. She didnt ask us how our food was either. Not a good experience for me, I wont be back. YC's is much better, and I get great service because I can serve myself"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at the genghis grill.  I had such a fun experience!  First impressions were from my very enthusiastic and friendly server,  John Collins! Such a nice personality.  Second was one of the awesome chefs.  Another great personality, and helpful on the sly for me!  Great energy in this place.  The food was delicious and our server, John continued to socialize with my friend and I by using our first name! Never have I had a server who has done that.  During our meal,  we were informed about the frequent visitor card and got all signed  up.  At the end, to top it off,  John brought my friend and I waters to go.  After serving for 3.5 years in the past, I'm not sure if I've ever had such a pleasant experience!  These little touches just made our night.  Thanks again to John for a fun dinner :)"}
{"text":"I normally enjoy the food. I feel it is a bit overpriced but there are not many options for Mongolian BBQ in Phoenix. The reason for my low rating is due to my recent take out visit. I assembled my bowl and went to the bar to pay and wait for the food. The bartender was slow to get me checked out (not a big deal) but then shorted me on my change. I should have had 2.86 coming back and the bartender chose to just give me 2.00. Not the biggest deal in the world but very unprofessional. I felt uncomfortable asking for the change since he obviously felt like he earned it by taking care of my tab. Typically on take out I do not tip the bartender, I drop a couple bucks into the cooks tip jar. The bartender said less than 10 words to me and felt he was entitled to my change...The bartenders choice to keep the 86 cents is enough to keep me from coming back. I reached out to Ghengis Grill to let them know about my experience and never heard anything back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is so DELICIOUS.....Love being able to build my own bowl. Yummy! If you haven't been here, it is definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Edible, affordable, decent service. Brown rice and a source of protein. I'm not sure that I would come back here in the future, but in a pinch, it'll do."}
{"text":"I wanted to wait until I went back here a couple times before I wrote a review. I have been three times now, so here we go. The first visit was only a couple days after they opened and it seemed like it was not only everyone's first couple days at this location, but everyone's first day in the restaurant business. I wouldn't have called anything bad, but it just seemed like everyone was very new at their jobs.  The food was not my favorite among Mongolian bbq style restaurants I have been to. After two more visits, I think I have it ironed out. I was used to having many liquid sauces and flavorings at the end of the buffet line where here the majority of the flavoring takes place near the beginning of the line with dry spices. The spices are served with very tiny spoons so I did not take as much as I should which resulted in the final product being quite bland. After adjusting my seasonings, everything really seems to be clicking.  On my last visit, I had a delicious, well cooked meal and great service. This place is on it's way up and worth a try, especially since it is the only restaurant of this type that I know of in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"When it comes to the food 5 stars. No questions asked, always good.   As for the service....every time we come here I get disappointed. I drop to my knees outside and pray that once, just this one time, I'll get decent service. Nope. Kick in the nuts.   Thoughts: One, Maybe have more than one POS system for your servers. Could help.   Two, hey server guy, you got me a water. That's it. The whole meal. A single water. Not a refill, for the one water you brought me, which was empty for ten minutes. However, had you seen it empty it had taken you probably 5-10 minutes to refill it, this being based on how long it took you to fill up the Coke for the table next to us while you sat behind the bar and talked to the rest of the staff. Our food (once again always delicious, mix the 3G with the Thai peanut sauce, it's amazing. Recommended by another server, I think his name was Steve, that guy is probably awesome, I assume he drives like a cool truck and volunteers at some charitable organization) back to our food, you didn't bring us that, another server did.   So, in a matter of 30 minutes our server came by twice, once to bring me a water and the next to ask, Check? Well, my food is gone, my water cup as dry as the Sahara, and I've resorted now to downloading and playing some iPhone game about breaching a beach. I'm on level 100 because that's how long I've had since you last stopped by to check on me. Yeah....check.   I try hard to not be mean, but I served for a long time and I know it's not an easy job, but it's not that hard. Especially on a Friday lunch shift. And last, after you ask if I want my check could you not stop by the hostess stand to flirt and just bring me my check? I have to make it to a movie and if I miss the previews and most likely a new Melissa McCarthy movie trailer, so help me god.   So, after all this, will I stop coming. No, dammit no, because that sauce combo with udon noodles, shredded beef and sausage is just too damn amazing. And I always hold on to the small chance i may see Steve again and get a new recipe recommendation. Long live Steve."}
{"text":"Fine for airport food in a pinch in that for $11 or so you get a full steaming hot rice bowl with your protein of choose, some veggies, and it's reasonably healthy and fast. But it's pricey considering no drink is included (even a bottle of water which is $4 as it's mainly Fiji or Smart water). My tofu Buddha bowl was a little overcooked and bland. It could have used some spice or seasoning. My fiance's spicy shrimp bowl was slightly better but spicy and not flavorful is how we would both describe it.   I'd try something else the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm a every-other-month regular Genghis eater.  I'm all about my own design and have these tips for you.  Go for the LARGE unless you are one of those that doesn't do leftovers.  If you make it right, you will want it again.  For the $ difference you can stretch the larger portion.    Fill your bowl and pack the content down.  I like to add a lot of spinach and cilantro to mine and they take up room, so I smush it down.    DON'T go heavy on the sauces.  Some of the veggies are water holders and can make your stir-fry watery.  That doesn't do well for left overs.  With the large you get three choices for \"base\" of noodles, something, something-I go for 3 portions of cabbage.  Try it, you will never miss the calories from the carbs.  Since you get to create your own meal here, it can only be as good as your choices.  In this place you can make smarter ones and have all the flavor you thought you would miss.  Good luck and have fun!  Oh and sign up for the Genghis customer card.  A free bowl on your birthday, isn't it nice when someone buys you lunch that day?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight.  I'm never sure how to rate a place where you make most of your dinner yourself.  I give myself and the chef who heated up my food high scores, but the restaurant could have made it a little easier for a short person like me to get to the ingredients.  I found myself nearly laying on the ingredients to reach in the back.  Overall a nice enough dinner."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here when we were staying in Scottsdale a couple days ago and I was excited to hit up an actual stir fry place.  I am pretty solid on my 3 rating and I will tell you why... The service at the beginning was pretty good, we were seated right away and we were asked for our drink order right away as well.  The waiter explained to us what the process was and sent us on our way.  We waited in line to find a whole slew of protein ranging from chicken to beef to calamari to ham!  The veggie selection was not too bad either.  There was a great amount of sauces and seasonings but none of them really had descriptions so I wasn't sure what was what.  I stuck with the steamed rice to go along with my stir fry.  The rice wasn't bad but wasn't the best rice I had.  The stir fry was just alright, nothing amazing.  Our waiter really wasn't attentive after our drink order.  I had only one glass of diet coke but at least my sister was able to order a beer, which it looked like they had a pretty good selection of."}
{"text":"Worst 15 dollars that I have ever spent and that was just for lunch. Let me explain.  I come in on a Wednesday around 11:30 am. I am greeted by the host and shown to a table. Since I have never been here before, I am briefed on the process of getting my food. They give you two of what appears to be small dog food bowls and a small dipping sauce type of cup. One bowl you put in veggies and the other meat. For the dipping sauce type of cup, yup you guessed it, different sauces to mix in to your choices when it is being cooked.  Once you are done selecting your choices, you go up to the counter and hand it off to whoever is there that will cook it on the big circular flat top grill. You have to specify what kind of carb you want cooked with your ingredients like brown rice, noodles, etc. Then when its done cooking, your server will  bring it out to your table.  Now what I just described doesn't sound bad now does it? What im about to break down for you should convince you not to come here or at least if you try it, you will be uttering, \"Oh, that's what Roger T was talking about in his review.\"  First off, you have two options to decide before you start eating. Single trip or all you can eat. Prices are as follows: Lunch 8.99. Dinner 10.99. Add 4 dollars more to do the all you can eat option. By the way, it used to be 3 dollars.  Since I was really hungry and planned on making multiple trips to get my money's worth, I chose the 13 dollar all you can eat. That is just for the food yall. Drinks are not included. I decided just to have water.  So I do my thing and try to cram as much meat and veggies into my bowls. Their meat and veggie choices all seem to be housed in tiny containers which makes you feel like a pig if you are trying to get a lot of a certain meat or veggie. By the way, the only difference between lunch and dinner is for dinner you get calamari and scallops. That's great news you say? Well, based on what I have seen, I wouldn't be surprised if these were tiny little cut up pieces.  I sit down and wait for my food. After about 5 minutes later, I received it in a weird odd sized bowl/plate? When I see my food, I swear I thought I put a lot of veggies and especially meat since I am a carnivore. What you gotta understand is when all these items you select are grilled together, they shrink a lot.   After I finished my bowl, I was ready to go and grab some more food. This is where the deception is because in order for you to go up and get more food, you have to tell your server exactly that and they will go get you new bowls. This is where you will notice the difference between these guys and other traditional Mongolian Grills. The ones im familiar with, you grab your own bowls and do your thing. The only waiting you do is for the cooking. Not these guys. Sometimes it takes a while for the server to come around just so you can ask for more bowls. Then you have to wait for them to come back with your bowls. Then you have to wait for it to be cooked. When it gets done cooking, it sits on the counter until your server picks it up and puts it on your table.  So you see this is where my gripe is. By the time I came around to my third serving, I was starting to feel that full feeling which doesn't make sense because at other places, I can easily go through 3 servings and not feeling full at all. The process that you have to go through to get your food, whatever you ate prior is starting to settle which gives you the im not hungry feeling any more.   My total bill came up to about 14 and some change. I put 15 bucks on the table and walked away. My server was slow in everything. Don't get me wrong. Its not like I was in a rush but at the same time I don't have all day. I think this place is a scam. Their process purposely slows everything down so you don't get to eat as much as you really want. The day I went, it didn't get really busy until about 12. When it gets really busy, you will have to wait even longer in between each serving.   So you see, it really isn't worth it to eat here whether you choose all you can eat or not. I recommend going to the Fiesta Buffet just up the street off of Lake Mead for their Mongolian Grill. Lunch is 7 bucks and dinner is 10 bucks with a player card. You not only get two big bowls to put ingredients in, but the only time you wait is when it is being cooked. Plus they have other choices there and not just the Mongolian. Its not the best but it sure as hell beats out these guys. This also will prompt me to check out Stir Krazy Mongolian Grill on Paradise Rd since I heard good things about them."}
{"text":"From a Mongolian-Barbeque Fan!  I was talking with another business owner who also moved here from CA and told him I heard a new Mongolian BBQ restaurant was coming to town. He said they'd had one here before (over by Independence?) but it didn't go over well, because I think they used mongolian BBQ in their name (as most of them do in socal) and the locals (he may have said 'rednecks') went in and said 'hey -- war's the BBQ????'  ;-)  If you haven't experienced this kind of eating before...go give it a try.  It's basically stir fry. You pick the meats you want, put 'em in the bowl. Pick your veggies, load 'em on in there.  Want an egg? Put on up there,... the grill masters will scramble it and add it to your mix.  Then you choose whether you want white or brown rice, noodles, even a tortilla.  They'll grill it all up and serve on top of the starch of your choosing.!  YUM.  We went to try Genghis Grill last week and it was really good.  Here's a tip -- you squish the food down in the bowl so you can fit alot. In CA, you have a plate to put your bowl on, and a small plate to keep your hands clean if you want to squish the contents down!  The theory being that if you just fill the bowl to the top, by the time it cooks down during grilling, you'll be left with about a cup of food. So pile high, friends... it's good stuff!!    Also -- they will give you samples of the sauces that go on at the end..but remember that it will probably come out hotter than you expect.  My brother joined the group of us that went last week, and he told the lady at the sauce counter he doesn't really like hot things. She suggested two, which he tried, and then ladled on. By the time it cooked all thru the meat and veggies, it was REALLY hot and almost too much for him. But he did manage to eat it all... maybe he's becoming a fan of pepper-heat.    Look forward to going again soon... it's kind of addictive."}
{"text":"Well, unlike Stephanie, I actually ate here. It wasn't packed, but it wasn't dead. It was juuust right. I was a little weirded out by the theme and the faux bronze bust of Genghis Khan at the grill. Er. What's next, Stalin's Salon? or maybe Hitler's Hummus Hut?   My only other Mongolian grill experience is with YC's, so I was impressed to see they had an extensive selection real, fresh protein (very, -very cold- fresh meats, reassuringly...even sausage and scallops), spices, veggies, egg!, sauces (all sugar-based... ehhhh), and starches.   They even have a little guide system showing you which items to pick if you want a particular bowl (teriyaki, Cajun, whatever). I just filled mine with whatever looked good. After they grilled it all up they served it in a bizarre asymmetrical bowl that first looked like I'd just dump my food all over myself, but it actually proved to be quite conducive to... shoveling. And it was delicious.  The flat screen TVs are weird. Their placement is such that the employees can probably watch them just fine, but most of the people actually eating here can't. Very odd.   A single bowl is about $8, while all-you-can-eat is $12. I was full after half a bowl and took the rest  home (no charge for a to-go box like YC's, yay!)  Edited 5/26/08- Okay, service here is almost always terrible. I've only ever had one really attentive server, a really petite friendly woman who chatted with us and checked in often. Otherwise, service has always sucked. So bad that I've ended up fetching my own food (normally your server brings it to you) and my own water (!!). A couple times the food area was a total mess with food all over the floor and counters... which, I understand, is part of the problem of telling people \"here's your food, quickly pile it as high as you can!\" so maybe I was just there at exactly the wrong moment."}
{"text":"i will admit i am not exactly a mongolian grill expert.  i can take it or leave it.  but when a certain friend of mine visits from florida, i will always take him to a mongolian grill because he is a mongolian grill addict.  he has driven 2 hours (over 120 miles) just to get a decent mongolian grill in florida (shout out to BD's mongolian)..  well, we tried this place.  utter disappointment.  everything the previous bad reviews have said is true so i won't reiterate all that, including the ridiculous trouble of having trouble reaching the back ingredients.  but my biggest complaint was this:  what always made an overpriced bowl of veggies, rice and meat tolerable to me in the past was the SHOW!  you take your bowl up to a huge round grill, hand it over to the cook, and the cook puts on a show!  flipping food, twirling food, making fire over the grill, joking with the onlookers, all the things you see at a hibachi restaurant.    at genghis, you hand your bowl over to the cooks, and you go sit down and they bring it out to you.  i felt like i went to a movie only to be made to sit in the lobby to eat subquality popcorn that cost much more than it was worth.  and the service?  what service?  i waited a long, long time before a waiter showed up and i was finally able to ask for a glass of water that took a long time as well.  the place was not busy around 3 pm.  there's no excuse for poor service when the place is not crowded.  i usually tip generously but not this time.  my mongolian grill god friend says next time, he'll choose the restaurant.  i was embarrassed and thought it was a huge waste of a lot of money."}
{"text":"First words out of our waitress' mouth: \"Sorry about that. My friend turned 21 last night, and I'm still a little hungover.\" Right...at least she was honest?  She had forgotten to get our drinks for quite a while. We had to flag her down. It's okay though, she was hungover.   Then a guy walked around the entire restaurant three times with my bowl of food, walking past me each time, with my number in plain sight. I even stopped him, saying I thought he had mine. \"No,\" he said, as he continued to search for a unicorn with a magic number somewhere past the rainbow. Finally he discovered me and delivered my food about 5 minutes after my friend got his.  I might go here again, because the food was good, and the available options are plentiful. Note to first timers: don't follow the recommended recipes on the cards/wall. Just throw in whatever looks good. And watch out for blondes who appear to be hungover."}
{"text":"I took my teenage daughter here on a Saturday afternoon while we were running errands & was very pleased.  While I was familiar with the concept of Mongolian BBQ, she was not, so the waitress took her time explaining exactly what needed to happen.  I had to help out a little bit along the way, but the waitress (Kat?) was great.    We went down the food-bar making our bowls, and while yes, the silver bowls that they give you are pretty small, it's pretty easy to stack all of the things you want inside.  Personally, I ended up with a bowl of food that was bigger than I could eat, as did my daughter.  The choices were good, though there were a few things that I felt were missing.  I would have liked some better options in the produce, but it was still pretty good.  There were a LOT of protein options - steak, chicken, shrimp, sausage, etc.  I used marinaded steak and shrimp.  Sauces and spices - again a lot of options.  As I'd never been here, I wasn't sure what I wanted, but I pieced it together and was happy with the end product.  To top it off, your carb is separate.  While many places give you a bigger bowl, you often have to stuff your noodles in there as well as the meats and veggies.  Genghis doesn't do it that way.  When you give your bowl to the chef, you tell him which carb you want.  I went with the Udon and was happy to see that they were Udon noodles and not spaghetti noodles, like I sometimes see.  All in all, a good experience.  I'd like to go back again sometime for dinner & try the scallops."}
{"text":"Dirty and unprofessional staff.  My husband and I were going to stop in here for a quick bite but decided to leave because the restaurant was so filthy and the staff was incompetent.  Instead of having the host stand at the front not doing anything have her start to clear the dirty dishes that were on peoples tables or wipe the menus with a cloth... GROSS."}
{"text":"Good food but disappointment the bowls aren't all you can eat anymore.   The atmosphere is swanky Chinese style bar with an urban feel. Typical Buffett line style with raw meats and veggies to create your own master piece. I enjoy having control of the amounts and ratios of meat to veg!   Tables are small and not well fit for larger parties but, I would do a huge get together here... it's not that kind of Resteraunt. Flavor is in your hands so you can't really talk or review the taste! I will go back. I enjoyed it and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Worst place ever.   Antonio is the worst person to work here.  He is rude.  I forgot to fill up more meat and he said I had to pay more.  It wasn't even cooked.  He should be fired. Or all my reviews will be bad for this restraunt"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why a couple people have been giving bad reviews, maybe they came in on an off day. Or jus not that into mongolian stir fry. Not sure but my experince was awesome i loved it here and definitely coming here again. Getting your own drinks i don't mind that i mean how many of us have been to a restaurant and waited several minutes for a refill? Thats why i prefer getting my own drink not to mention making up for own bowl. Yes this is a bit of wait time but you have to keep in mind that if ther are other people infront of you,your going to have to wait your turn. Other then that your getting it fresh off the grill. You have a vast varieties of meats veggies sauces spices so you can mix it up every one in awhile i see nothing wrong with that. This place is great i do recommend this place. Great food and at an awesome price too!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. Best food I have had in awhile. Great Customer Service by Bill  Wasn't impressed by what I think was the manager in non uniform wearing glasses just walking around watching then telling my waiter to after he left my table (to cut out the talking)  He was very friendly and was great to inform me about all the different options and just cared about my experience in general which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"We used to come here before I went to work all the time because it was fast and healthy. Recently, the prices have gone way up and the device has gone down. I don't think we will ever come back and that's sad because we used to love this place. No one was in the restaurant and the girl refilling the veggies and meat was just standing there and my husband had to wait forever for sliced beef and I had to wait for tomatoes but originally she lied and said they were \"out\"."}
{"text":"Love this place. Manger really nice and so are the servers. Food is good and you get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"This a great place for lunch or dinner.  You get to pick out your meats, vegetables, spices and sauces.  Love the food here.  The service was slower than normal- sounded like we got there at the end of a rush.  If it wasn't for the food, we actually may have walked out and gone somewhere else.  But knowing how much we enjoy the food, we stick it out and it was great!"}
{"text":"My husband misses mongolian bbq restuarants that we had back in VA.  So I found this place.    We got there at 6 at were seated right away.  The waitress explained about Build-A-Bowl.  One thing I think is AWESOME is that the kids bowls are all you can eat...which means that if you make something your kid doesn't like you can go make another one:)  There is a good selection of meat, veggies, spices, and sauce.    The service was pretty good.  We never ran out of drink and she made sure we were happy.  We left about an hour and a half later (our son is a slow eater) and there were groups of people waiting outside.  I do believe we will be going back."}
{"text":"I have been to many Mongolian BBQs and have never been to one that I would not re-visit......until now!  When I was greeted at the door (not knowing anything about this particular place) I asked if they cooked on the typical Mongolian BBQ flat grill and I was told no. Then an annoying waitress sat us and explained how it works and then took us to the food section and pointed out the \"protein\", \"veggies\", \"sauces\" and \"starches\". We selected our food from the buffet-style area. The food containers were under a hood but were so low and far back that it was really difficult to get your food. AND, almost 1/2 of the serving utensils were lying down in the food where they could spread germs etc etc.  from people handling them and putting them back. The dish, that my food was served in, had a chip in it the size of a dime. (did not notice right away cause it had food over it) And last but not least.....I could not identify ANY taste that came with it. My mouth felt as though it was sticking together with glue. On each table was a mini-tablet that had video games and a few pages of ads for the food served within the restaurant. Not totally showing the whole spectrum of food but ....? The absolute best thing was that after your food is served, this little tablet called a \"Presto\" has your bill available to you and you can swipe your CC or Debit card at the table and get the hell out of there without any other dis-satisfactions.   Pros: Had a GREAT bowel movement the next day!!"}
{"text":"Genghis is by far the best build your own mongolian stir fry bowl in town.  The quality and selection of meats is outstanding with tons of amazing sauce combinations to eat through.  Love the korean pork and marinated chicken.  Staff is fantastic and helpful."}
{"text":"No stars for this place! I am so angry it all started when my boyfriend and I walked in and were asked if we've been here before I said no but I've ate the food the waiter sarcastically ask well then how have you ate here, my friend brought her leftovers over and I've tried them, anyways our waitress Taylor was even worse she took us to the line and gave us the absolute worst explanation ever and walked away she didn't ask if we had any questions anything which I would have been fine with if she didn't have such a bitch face while explaining it. She asked if I was okay while I literally had food in my mouth so I nodded my head and she then more loudly repeated the question as she walked right in front of me I heard her say ugh omg and took a sarcastic deep breath I cannot believe it I was so angry that I told the manager I wanted the rest of my food to go and the worst part about it was that she didn't care she was so careless and did nothing to even attempt to make the situation better. I will not be back and feel sorry for the owner mcdonalds has better customer service then here. Terrible terrible service Taylor should really consider a new career path."}
{"text":"My first time going.....  The waitress looked like she was ready to give birth as she took our drink order. I had stated I had never been there before but she still didn't give me the break down of how this whole grill thing worked. \"In her defense she appeared to be the only one working there\"   My kids loved it because their bowl's were endless, they were able to make and eat as much as they wanted and it was well priced for theirs.   The adult bowls on the other hand were not worth it. Very pricey for one bowl and wouldn't be worth it to spend almost $15 for an endless bowl.   The grill line wasn't as clean as I would have wanted, but needless to say the kids that were in front of us knew how to pile on their items and just leave a mess behind.   The part of watching them grill, I have to say I was impressed and my daughter were in aww to watch it happen also.   We had a 20% off coupon and the waitress never took it off the bill, had to wait 15 minutes just to get our bill so I didn't want to wait any longer to have her deduct a few dollars.   The food tasted excellent. If they would lower their price and get some better staff I might frequent this one more often."}
{"text":"A complete dissapointment and very overpriced for what you get. On top of that, you have to wait at the grill while they cook your food.   The biggest classless blunder they made was placing a sign in front of the grill station reminding people to please tip the gill master and the wait staff.   A very tacky move.  Yes, the staff was very friendly and accomodating.........  If you aren't familiar with the Mongolian sauces and spices........you are better off going to a place that has the experience in cooking these dishes.   I wish them well.....I just don't expect to see them around when everyone gets bored with it."}
{"text":"This has been a go to spot for years!  I have always like the Mongolian BBQ table that's always loaded and fresh, the cooks have personality and are always ready and efficient.  Located at Tempe Market Place in the Casual food row, Genghis offers full service and a full bar, and with a menu that sports appetizers, deserts and specialty cocktails. 3 sizes of bowls with a buck off each for lunch, and the apps are pretty solid. Today I had the chicken lettuce wraps and for the first time ever someone is making them better then PF Chang's, they are different but better. I re-ordered them today(2 orders) something I rarely do in a restaurant.  I almost hate to mention that this is one of my very favorite secret Happy Hour spots with amazing daily specials and super cheap drinks and beers 3-6. Oh and those lettuce wraps are half off to, I think all of the apps are half price.  Round this out with stellar service all around and a manager present working the floor with the staff. There are not enough places doing it right like Genghis Grill does!"}
{"text":"Yes, I AM a fan of Mongolian Grills.  I love that you can pick your own everything that goes in your food.  For me, it's like getting to almost cook, then not having to clean up!  Genghis Grill is a nice place.  The staff if friendly, the food is good and they do a good job of keeping things CLEAN!  That's very important, because the \"buffet bar\" is all raw food.  Don't be scared, just give it a shot.  And do listen to them when they suggest certain measurements, especially with the spices.  They know what they're talking about.  I have also tried their dumplings.  I love them.  They cook them on the big round grill and get them as crispy as you want them.    Give this place a try if you're in the area.  You can be as creative as you want to be, and you're sure to find something you like!"}
{"text":"Well I've been here a number of times and have had no problems before. But today, the fried rice was beyond disgusting. My bf got it and he told me to try it because it tasted weird, so I tried it and spit it out in my napkin. Super mushy and plain gross. I told the waitress and then another fellow came over to ask us about it. I explained it was nasty and wondered if anyone else had said anything about the fried rice and he said no. So his suggestion was to bring us another side of it!!! And then to explain to me that's what happens when you add sauce to the rice. Excuse me? First of all, I'm not ignorant. I know what this should taste like. It's never tasted like this. Second of all, how is that fixing my problem? It's not. He had no other suggestions. Not to remake it with a different rice or noodle. Not to take it off the bill. Nothing. So my bf was just stuck picking at his food.   Then to makes matters better. My sister's order was wrong. She asked for steamed rice and they gave her udon noodles. So when she asked to get it fixed by just getting a side of the steamed rice, they brought a side of fried rice. REALLY?! So she took a bite of it and it was nasty as well. The others in our party also tried it and they were all saying the same thing, it was disgusting.   What's the point of asking how I like my food if your not going to take the initiative to get it fixed and make me happy? Pathetic. I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Genghis Grill. Yes, I am hooked. I love that you are seated at this location first, upon being seated the waiter/waitress will take your drink order and then ask you which size bowl you would like. Small, Medium or Large. I can't imagine eating a large bowl medium does myself good! The magic is in how you pack your bowl, pack that thang (thing) to the top guys! Seriously put your veggies on the bottom and mush the heck out of them, lol build a wall with your meat on the side and like a Lego keep building up! Yes this meal prep is that serious! But let me back up real quick and explain. Upon picking your bowl size you will then get up and walk to a selection of veggies, protein and sauces to dress your meal up just the way you want, spicy, garlicky, sweet or savory the choice is yours. Once you complete your bowl you will be giving another option to add rice or noodles to complete your creation and stir fry it all up!  It cooks wayyyyyy down once fried and this is way I say pack it on and mush it all the way down in the bowl! I love my creations and this fun restaurant. Drink options are the soda machine, fresh juice, wine or an alcoholic beverage! My go to is always a mojito. Bowls run in the price range of $9.00-$15.00"}
{"text":"We visited on Christmas Eve, The service here is absolutely spectacular John took great care of us and was extremely friendly and helpful. The food is also good nothing was frozen like how most places are that are similar which gave the meat more flavor along with they had Watermelon lemonade AMAZING. Christian the cook was also great and cooked the food to perfection. Highly recommend to friend and family if you want great food, great service, and a great environment don't change a thing."}
{"text":"Great concept and place to bring growing boys. The Korean beef is my fav with noodles. The kids get the unlimited bowls and try everything.   You really don't need dessert but the mini cheesecake sampler is the perfect portion size."}
{"text":"The service was so bad. Our waiter forgot our beer and took him 10 minutes to bring a warm beer. Also I had to go get my bowl myself because it was sitting out on the counter for a long time. When I looked in my bowl, my food was burned and tasted so bitter. Sorry but I won't go back again"}
{"text":"I usually have a hard time giving restaurants 5 stars. However here at GENGHIS GRILL that's not a problem. The meat options are the best in the state as well as the quality. They have pretty much every veggie you would want to add to a stir-fry bowl and the sauces are amazing. I always feel like I am well taken care of here from the refills to the way I am treated when I first walk in. GREAT JOB GENGHIS. You earned this five star rating!!"}
{"text":"Genghis Khan could never make it past the great wall of china, unfortunately Arizona's border is not as secure.  We walked in and at 8 pm on a Saturday and I though they might be closing as it was empty inside and there were just two tables in use on the patio.  There is a menu, however you basically then go and fill a bowl with protein and veggies. The bowl itself is much smaller yet the same price $9.99. The veggie options are a bit lacking as some things exists only in a mix, some items were frozen, and others were not well stocked. The sauces are a real shortcoming with a few thick gloppy sauces that you put in to a metal ramekin. As for your \"starch\" they add the noodles or rice, there is no rice after cooking. The bowl is brought to you meaning you do need to tip.  My bowl was not enjoyable, it was not well cooked with some veggie items still being raw, the sauces were bland despite copious amounts of them, and again the peanut condiment tray was empty.   I will be sticking to YC's or MuShu and I recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch for the first time.  I was very surprised how good and different their food was.   Service was great.  I had a salad with chicken on it and it was very very tasty.   I forget what it was called but it was the first one of there 2 salads they offer on the menu.  My girl made up her own bowl and she said it was very good.  Try their bread ap it has shrimp on it and comes with a tasty dipping sauce.  Very good and we will be back."}
{"text":"My second time here and its better each time I come. I packed my bowl high and spiced it up. Sooooo yummy. This place is so fresh and delicious. Its a great healthy place to eat. My kids have no issue deciding what to have, which is usually an issue for us. They also have a supreme limeade mixed drinks menu with unlimited refills. I love the one with ginger, to die for. Definitely recommend this spot for everyone."}
{"text":"I almost feel like I am cheating, but as someone who has been going to YC's for 15 years, and has done her best to stay true to them as their veggies got limp, the floors got dirty, and the staff got sweatier, I just can't do it anymore, not with this hot new Mongolian Grill around the corner. This place takes it to a whole new level, and its so clean, and so many options, nothing can compete...then you throw a $2 pint happy hour special in there and yeah, sorry YCs...can we still be friends?"}
{"text":"Visited last night... Took forever for a to go order. Vegetables were way way way over cooked as well in both of our meals. For the price I expect them to pay attention to that kind of thing. Unlikely to return based on this experience."}
{"text":"First of all we now have a Mongolian BBQ restaurant in the west valley. So kudos for that. I actually liked my dish which I made up from my own Mongolian BBQ experience, I only did this because I did not like any of the recommended receipes. This is pretty easy to do; select any meats and veggies you like then select the sauce. This is where I wasn't thrilled with the choices none looked like any other Mongolian BBQ places i've been to, for one thing they were all pretty thick sauces. Normal Mongolian BBQ places usually have a house sauce, soy sauce, and other Asian sauces. The one last gripe was that the bowls were kind of small and therefore a small portion of food, usually if the bowls are small you should get multiple turns to make a dish."}
{"text":"Many different choices!! All of what you want... Plenty of different meats, spices, veggies & sauces. Make your own creations. Get a Genghis card & earn free bowls the more you go!! Great food & great staff!!!"}
{"text":"Better than Panda Express! Thank you Jesse, great service and food. Ate here 2 days in a row #notsorry"}
{"text":"This is the second time coming to Genghis Grill and to tell you the true I was a little skeptical in going in again because the service the first time at the Tempe Market where waitresses and waiters were very indiferent to even check periodically or ask if we needed. Anything else also it took a while to get. A re fill on a glass of my iced tea which I set in purppose at the edge of the table empty while staff kept going by acting like it they were very busy also we waited a long time to get our check, the food was good overall My experience at the Frank Lloyd Wright location was very much rewarding and pleasant the staff was very joyfull and attentive to detail,from the moment we enter the door we were welcome and seated promply by the host and told that Tony will be our waiter which he did an amazing job starting by introducing himself and accomodating us with anything we needed our glasses of iced tea were NEVER empty and check on us in a timely matter I end up taking food home and a container for my iced tea provided by Tony over all service was EXCELLENT Tony you are awesome we will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. If you get a bowl, you can select the size and ingredients to your liking. There is a great selection of proteins, as well as variety of veggies and fruits to add, topped with the sauce and spices to complete the experience.  They also accommodate for soy allergies, so that's a bonus!"}
{"text":"Service was really nice (minus the whole employee's have to cover their tattoos situation). The concept of loading your plate with what you want is cool and they carry coke product's (a lot of them).  Two things that make me smile. The price is right considering the meal that you get. They were a little slow at getting the tables cleaned  after guest left but they did a good job at preparing my food and getting it out to us quick."}
{"text":"The Mongolian BBQ craze is a reminent of the 80's that will not wither away.  Every so often I get nostalgic and pursue my hunger cravings.  When this happens, the Genghis Grill is a great solution.  The location is ideal: close enough to the mall for easy access; far away enough to park your car.  The restaurant itself is clean and the food is fresh.  The staff is courteous and helpful with suggestions.  The actual meal is delicious, but sometimes I get impatient waiting for the fool in front of me to figure out whether he/she needs two or three carrots and spends two minutes figuring it out when all I want to do is eat!  The meat selection is great: seafood, steak, chicken, etc.  Plenty of veggies and sauces.  The trick is to fit as much uncooked food into the bowl.  That is the part I hate.  I usually end of spilling something, or at the very least try to balance the food so it makes it to the cook in one piece.  I will gladly recommend this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on the news last night  me and my wife decided to have lunch here today. When we arrived we were asked if this was our first time here and we informed the waitress it was she and the rest of the staff walked us thru on how to build our bowls and sauces. I don't really remember our waitress's name or the manager's name I was happy with our meals. We will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"I just had the worst service ever. With the way the restaurant is set up, the only job of the waitress is to bring my bowl, bring me a box for my leftovers, and bring my check. I waited 25 minutes after I was clearly done with my food for my waitress to bring me a box. I had my card out so she'd know I wanted my check. Then it took her 10 minutes just to bring my check. I told her when I got there I had a free bowl and she wrote down my rewards number. She didn't discount the bowl. I had to wait another 10 minutes for her to bring my new check. HORIBBLE EXPERIENCE!!!  One good thing - the food is good.  *Update: I ALSO GOT FOOD POISONING! *Update: The manager did try calling me and emailing me. I told him/her there is nothing he/she can do to make me go back, but I did appreciate his/her customer service."}
{"text":"Fresh Meat, Fresh Veggies and authentic Sauce.  I love Mongolian BBQ food and this is wonderful.  They do not use \"frozen meat\" and boy can you tell.  They have Chicken, Beef, And Seafood to choose from. Most of the time service is good."}
{"text":"Great service stop in for lunch. The build you own stir fry line was fully stocked witg all the meat, vegetables,  and sauces. I love having the gong rung when I put a tip in the glass for the cooks."}
{"text":"Love this place. Make it exactly how you want. Danielle, our server was awesome. I chose medium which was more than plenty. I made steak and bacon bowl with broccoli, baby corns, steamed rice and had the egg added at the grill. With the teriyaki sauce it was great. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I can say I will not come back here.   It was an interesting experience, the service was not too great, I was not impressed. I had to make sure if an allergy and the person working there couldn't tell me much. It was difficult to \"stack our bowls\" because most of it just slid off. It took a long time to get our bowls, one of them came out late and burnt (the rest of the table was done eating already).   Needless to say, we should have chosen another place."}
{"text":"Amazing value for amazing food! Loved how they allowed for huge piles regardless of bowl size. 5 stars when they decide keep the prep area clean.  Otherwise you navigate the messy tables and nobody likes that."}
{"text":"I was in the Phoenix area for a week for work and stopped by in Tempe to meet a friend. She recommended Genghis Grill and we went there. The ambience was good and the waiter was friendly. The food was awesome too similar to flat top grill where you can create your own stir fry.   Will go there again if I am in town again."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite place to eat in the valley back in 2013, but ever since a few years ago, the quality of the place has certainly dropped. The restrooms are disgusting, moist, and the hallways and floors are dirty. The prices have increased as well since then and the new staff seem to be confused to what they are doing half the time.   The only great thing about this place is the food. It's definitely delicious. The prep area is kept clean and there is a little cross contamination, but nothing too severe. If anyone is allergic to anything, they'll accommodate you quickly."}
{"text":"Given this place multiple tries and each time service fails!!  Done, over will not go back."}
{"text":"I had one bad experience, and every experience since has been much much better. The food has been delicious, and the service superb."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's the perfect place to get your protein and veggies! The one thing I don't like is that I keep getting coupons sent to my email that done work anywhere. Whoever send out those emails should be fired. It's happened twice to me already. Thankfully this time the manager Trevor helped us out because the coupon did not specify a location. Besides the little bump in the road our service was great. I will be back, the food is really good here."}
{"text":"Fresh food.  You load it up yourself, so you own the taste and results.  Really cool idea. Just 2 things wrong . 1. Floor was sticky and you could hear it in people's footsteps. 2. Was my daughters birthday. Waitress said they don't sing or do dessert.  Last year she got a brownie and we sang.  Waitress said new CEO outlawed it.  Bad decision.  Social media good will would be worth a scoop of ice cream!  Service good otherwise!"}
{"text":"This place made both my sister and me sick.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ate there for dinner tonight. The restaurant was very crowded and the wait was more than 15 minutes after you left your bowl at the grill to be cooked. The food in the buffet line looked old.  The broccoli was not florets but rather tiny, tiny pieces. The green beans looked like they were out of a can and the quality of everything was average at best. Two of us for dinner, one time through and 2 ice teas for $28 seems a bit much for fast food. If we are looking for Mongolian BBQ we will stick with YC's."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous. We went there this afternoon. There was a nice crowd there but we were sat right away. They have a 5 step process to making your own \"bowls\". After going through the buffet style station, you bring your bowl to the cooks and  they get the show on the road. Our lunch was done and on our table in about 7-8 minutes.  My only complaints aren't that serious but still bothered me none the less...  1- It was bitterly cold in there! I was literally shivering as I tried to eat lunch. I'm not one to get cold so for me to be FREEZING.. the AC was definitely on too high.   2- While going along the line making our bowls, there were three rows of random ingredients. I couldn't reach the back row! My husband had to reach anything I wanted for me. The woman behind me had the same problem. Not everyone has gorilla arms! Cater to everyone please! Buy longer spoons!   Outside of that, everything was great. Our server \"Sasha\" was very informative and was knowledgeable. She answered all the questions we had about sauces and food allergies.  Will be back again soon! Yum!"}
{"text":"Really confused about the high star rating here...  I was actually excited for airport food due to the high Yelp reviews.  Should have dialed down my expectations?  I got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  The rice and chicken were both really dry.  The veggies were soggy.    Service was great, unlike some other posters, but that did not make up for the food.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?    Price was right - under $10 for food with tax."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but the onboarding experience was miserable and confusing.  Normally Mongollian style BBQ is fun and exciting to go through the line and watch it be prepared.  Instead this was just frustrating."}
{"text":"Tasty bowls of delights!  But I have to agree with an earlier comment that the prices ARE a bit high. On the plus side, though, they do offer free birthday bowls which I took advantage of. Today is my birthday so we didn't have to pay for a Regular bowl which is normally priced at $11.49.  Hubby chose a Large bowl which was $14.49. Prices are subject to tax, of course. If not for the birthday discount, the price would have been $25.98 plus tax. Since the bowls are rather on the small side, I would have to agree with reviewer Chris V. who posted about 5 months ago.  The other Mongolian grill we've been to was in Utah and we don't remember paying as much -- even with paying for 2 bowls -- and they were good too, taste-wise.  Genghis Grill has a self-serve soda service which is separate from the bowl price.  All in all, we had a delicious and filling meal which rounded the day off to a beautiful ending."}
{"text":"Talk about some good customer service. My kid picked something he didn't like the manager said go back change it no problem.  Food is awesome here. Tons of selections and many different combinations. Get the bigger bowl it will be worth it"}
{"text":"This place is soooooooo much fun to eat at! Not only do you get to mix all your own ingredients, seasonings and sauces but they are high quality. You also even have an option of calamari which I absolutely LOVE. I also like how the noodles or rice are added after instead of squeezing it in your bowl."}
{"text":"Used to come here often last year. Came in tonight and the service was bad. Took 10 minutes to get our waters. My sister and I got our food and after almost finishing it halfway the last person in the group was still waiting for there food even though the large party that came in way after us were already getting their food. After finally seeing my server (who barely checked on us in the beginning). I let her know she was missing a plate and finally brought it right after. Even after having all of that happen I still would have came back, but what upset me the most is she was pressuring us to leave. She brought us the check and boxes even though the the last person in our party had just started eating. We knew she just wanted us to leave even though she had another table. She came over and opened the check book and asked if we can pay already because she wanted to start closing out. She stood there and watched us take out money to pay. I couldn't understand why she was rushing us out if the large party was still taking their time eating and taking photos. I don't think I'll ever go back. I'm a server and I would never push for guest to leave. Or watch them pay and leave a tip. Don't know our servers name, but she was a red head who served us on feb 18 around 9. Watch you hire. Servers like that push guest away."}
{"text":"If I could zero stars I would!!! Half cooked rice, out if shrimp and the scallops were questionable."}
{"text":"The manager was outstanding! And all service was too! Even encouraged us to sign up for their rewards so we'd get a free appetizer or dessert when we come in next!"}
{"text":"The servers were inattentive. I didn't like not knowing what flavors the sauces really had. I did think their options for the grill were decent. The prices were a little higher than I thought they should be. Overall it was just okay."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant before we go to a movies we always stop by for dinner. Always good customer service and great food for the money. Medium bowl is all you really need or least you really hungry! Happy hour isn't bad either! Go check this one out."}
{"text":"This place deserves better rating. It's rly nice place with great food and good service, for the price its 5stars."}
{"text":"We didn't want to eat at the food court at the mall and hoped that Genghis Grill would be better.  It's been FIVE years since I've been to Genghis Grill and it did change some.  Genghis Grill is a small casual Mongolian Stir Fry Restaurant with a bar. A hostess seats you and then you fill out a card with the size stir fry you want small, medium or large and your side that goes under your stir fry rice, noodles or cabbage.  We ordered some vegetable pot stickers. They came out pretty fast and did come with a tasty dipping sauce but the filling in the dumpling looked like it went through a blender. The pot stickers were the best part of our meal and they weren't so great.  I thought the ginger fish looked like the freshest choice for the protein so I picked that. The bowl is very tiny and I had little room for vegetables. The guy behind the glass said just pile it higher. After I tried to pile in some vegetables I selected some dry spice and a spicy red chili  stir fry sauce. Then I passed my bowl to the stir fry guy.   I went back to my table and in a bit the waitress brings us our stir fry. I look for some fish but I can't find one piece. I think it got chopped up real fine like rice. (ICK) I go to try a piece of broccoli. It's hard and got that bad broccoli smell and made me \"GAG.\" My bowl is mostly rice with mashed up fish. It just taste awful. I was really starving but my stomach just locked up from trying this food.  My husband took different meats and used different spices and sauces than mine. He said his didn't taste good either and was convinced that mine must be better so he tried to eat mine. But he couldn't eat mine either.  Our server was cheerful and ok. She asked us if we wanted boxes for our leftovers, we declined and she just smiled.  I just don't know if it's possible to make a delicious stir fry here.  The food made us \"Gag\"   The Gag-us Grill  1.5 stars rounded up because the workers seemed nice."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan. This is very different from the average Mongolian place. You can not only get a large selection of protein items, such as beef, pepperoni and chicken, but you can add your own seasonings. You can follow their recipes or create your own. Who would have thought you can make a Cajun garlic chicken teriyaki Mongolian bowl with rice noodles? It actually turned out great."}
{"text":"I love YC's so my friend suggested that I try Genghis Grill out. We went on a double date and I was less than pleased. First off the recipes were sort of hidden and the line was moving way too fast so I couldn't search for them. Instead I ended up frantically putting on random spices and hoping it would taste good.   The waitress was really rude to us when we asked her questions about the location and restaurant. Since I didn't use an actual recipe my food was kind of gross.  If you want good mongolion go to YCs. If you're in Tempe Marketplace, skip this place and get some Slices or something."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I love it! I had no idea what I was putting in my bowl the first time I came, and was a little overwhelmed because I didn't really know how it worked but I was not disappointed! Whatever I put in there came out awesome!   Second visit, I knew more what I was doing and what to go for. Just wish they would have some suggestions on good mixes....and also more dessert items.   Another plus, the computer check out systems. Its so much faster if you're paying with a credit card."}
{"text":"Fun to experience this at least once, they start a tall fire on the grill regularly and bang on a gong when they receive a tip.   Their veggies are fresh & plenty of proteins to choose from ( a little uneasy seeing raw chicken out).  Being a novice I had no idea how much sauce to use, I recommend you use about 1/2 a ramekin.  I can't say the atmosphere or decor did anything for the experience and our waitress didn't really look the part or look excited to be there."}
{"text":"I like the concept but for newcomers like myself it was a little offputting. When you arrive you are seated first and you chose from a small, medium or large bowl. Although the bowls all look tiny they contain quite a lot once it's full.  My word of advice: Don't get greedy! There are plenty of options to choose from whether you want veggies, meats or sauces. They are all relatively fresh and pretty tasty. The only reason why I give them 2 stars is that it becomes waaaay too easy to butcher up your dish if you mix and match too many sauces and meats.  I went there with my buddy and it was both our first time. Both our bowls came out incredibly salty and it was just an explosion of flavor. I put a pinch of the dragon salt, had a few meats that were marinated and a cup of the sauce and I guess that just made my bowl extremely salty. Can't blame anybody because we chose to add the dragon salt and other sauces ourselves, but before we started we told the servers we were first-timers and I wish she mentioned to go easy on the sauces. That would've been very useful.  I would like to try it again next time but it wasn't a very good first experience."}
{"text":"Coming from the Mid-west I was very used to BD's Mongolian BBQ, which is a very similar format to Genghis Grill.  I am very set on what I create (Steak, carrots, pasta, bbq sauce in a tortilla) and this place always satisfies my craving.  Becoming a member of the rewards club gets you very nifty discounts.  One time I paid $24 for an app, two soft drinks, two bowls and dessert!  The only downside on my past few visits has been the service.  Anytime this place gets busy it seems like the service goes down hill.  I seem to never get my tortillas with my bowl and the wait staff has inconsistent.  I did notice they added a Coca-Cola refresh machine which gives you the option to get your own drink so you are never thirsty.  4-stars manly because of the food!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Such great ingrients and a wonderful happy hour! I come here pretty regularly. I always go with steak and shrimp. $1 domestic beers all day everyday! Who can beat that? #YUM"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE mongolian style food fan but Genghis absolutely let me down.    The restaurant is essentially a \"make your own bowl\" meat buffet.  I asked the cooks for fried rice with my steak and chicken and it literally came back with burnt noodles.  I asked for them to return it for fried rice and they gave it back with overly cooked white rice.    Other than the cooks errors, the food was pretty decent UNTIL my wife and I got home a few hours later.  Both of us felt queezy (we shared each others meals) and then by midnight, we were both vomiting.  I apologize for the graphicness, but my wife literally had 2 small flies in her vomit.  Both of us were sick with food poisoning for 36 hours.  I am assuming the chicken wasn't cooked enough.     We will NEVER return to Genghis Grill."}
{"text":"I thought the place was pretty enjoyable. The service was excellent, the server was very friendly and attentive. The accessible self serve drunk station was awesome. Make sure to fill your bowl extra high because the veggies and meat shrink. I give it 4 out of 5 starts because it just seemed to be more expensive then what I got. The \"large\" saki, would have be considered a small anywhere else."}
{"text":"I had not been to a Mongolian grill type restaurant in several years. In fact I had not seen one in several years, but this was just across the street from the offices we were visiting that day.  Seated quickly at 2pm for a late lunch.  Per the Mongolian grill standard we selected our bowl size went to select our ingredients. Menu cards are available for novices or scaredy-cats.  No one else in line so the process was quick and I had my finished bowl in about 10 minutes.  Since I had picked the sauces and spices, the dish was appropriately spicy.  I still consider this style restaurant more appropriate for a date or night with new friends, as it gets you out of your seat and moving around. Also lots of opportunity to interact with the staff at the different stations.  Staff was very friendly and helpful as several in our party had not been to such a place before."}
{"text":"I can't really say anything about the food because I didn't stay long enough to try it.  It was pretty late at night and it seemed like they were the only ones still open in that area that we were in.   So we parked, went inside and were greeted by the hostess quickly.  She found us a place to sit, but I asked to be moved.  The table was directly under a ceiling fan that was going 100 miles per hour.   I hate that!  I don't like to eat cold food.  So she moved us to another table.  Once she left and we were trying to read the menu, the ceiling fan that was only four feet away as opposed to directly above me was going a little slower.  I think what bothered my husband the most and caused us to leave was that the lights were flickering like a strobe light because they were shining through the fans.  Maybe I'm just being picky, but those types of things really bother me."}
{"text":"Food was disappointing. I tried loading it up with the dry spices and the sauce at the end but it was a bit bland. Having the fresh meats side by side is a little disconcerting. Overall it wasn't bad food, but I've had much better at lower prices. I'm sure if I kept going I would figure out how to get a decent tasting meal, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort."}
{"text":"First, before I say what I stopped everything in my day to say is the food there is great.Being a regular I know that the staff works extremely hard but unfortunately it's because they are unethically forced too.I just got off the phone with the only manager I have ever had a quarrel with and his name is Justin.The phrase \"A wolf in sheeps clothing\" has never applied more to anyone I have conversed with in my life.He for one,bullies the staff around but thinks it's ok to do so because he's smiling.I say this because I've witnessed his \"management\" first hand and he has the vocabulary capability of a pirate holding a whip above his ship.He uses inappropriate language with those poor workers on a daily basis and it is not acceptable behavior in any line of work let alone the service industry.I personally had a conversation with him and he told me flat out that \"I didn't know what I was talking about\",\"That I could go look it up if I didn't know better\", and followed it up with hanging up on me on the phone.I have never witnessed such pompous, degrading, belittling, and stubborn behavior from any individual in any line of work in my life.So, I took the time out of my day to articulate the situation to all of the customers properly and let them know about \"JUSTIN\".Had Justin had more of a vocabulary at his dispense,more patience and better customer service,then this would not be posted.Everyone else there is 5 stars except for him and he doesn't have a place in there as a host let alone a manager.I hope the owner gets to read this so he knows how this person is behaving and treating both the customers and the employees in such audacious manner."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy and rather healthy. But it seems overly priced to me, but that's just me. I've been here a couple times now. Maybe 3. This last time I came with my boyfriend and the service was great. The guy was very helpful and friendly. He recommended trying the edamame they have because theirs is covered in lemon pepper or something like that. What I didn't need like was the prices of the bowls. The smallest bowl is $10. I mean, I guess if you were good you could pack on as much as you can. But anything falling off doesn't count. And what really bothered me was it was my boyfriends first time and we skipped ahead when choosing what to put on and in his bowl because he didn't know what all there was and when he went backwards to add more after seeing what was there, we found out there was a charge when you go backwards. It just seemed ridiculous and also not fair since it was his first time and he didn't know, and it didn't help that I didn't remember so I couldn't tell him. But other than that, the service was good and the edamame was so yummy!!"}
{"text":"At first look, Genghis Grill might appear like standard Applebees type of restaurant, but the food is surprisingly good for a serve-yourself restaurant. I prefer going there for dinner.   Tons of combinations. Have a lot of fun with it. I tend to prefer the rice over the noodles, but it comes down to personal preference.    They have alcohol, but for some reason, I'm never really in the mood to have anything there.   Also, the restaurant offers a Frequent Customer type of card, and you can eventually get a free meal there. It adds up surprisingly fast.   Parking is easy.   Service is just okay."}
{"text":"I go here at least twice a month.  It's an awesome experience and the staff is friendly and on the ball.  I always stack up on the seafood items, add some mushrooms and spinach and choose my sauce.  I also get double rice noodle.  You can also get free white or brown rice when your server brings you your bowl.  I will continue going there."}
{"text":"To start this is a make your own bowl style Mongolian grill. When I started to create my meal I noticed flys buzzing from each of the meats and other foods.   After creating my meal the chicken was well over cooked and hardly edible. The wait staff was rude and unhelpful and my over all opinion would NOT come back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Mediocre and overpriced Mongolian bbq. Came with a restaurant.com gift certificate, so the price wasn't too bad, but at a regular price of $10 a bowl, I could get more food for much better quality elsewhere. On the plus side, they have a pretty wide range of meats and flavors, and even offer recipe cards to help you compile your bowl. However, I didn't really like their selection of starches. They only had rice or udon noodles, but I really wanted something more like an egg noodle...  And though the service was friendly, the fact that they need waiters/waitresses simply to bring you drinks and your finished bowl seems rather unnecessary."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite places to go when I know I want something filling, flavorful, and fast!! I enjoy all the different meats and Veggies and switching them up for me taste buds liking...everytime it's something new and delish!!! The veggies and meats are always fresh and stocked. If you're a first timer I would suggest just Go For It pile up a bunch of ingredients you like and experiment...you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Had a friend in town from the East Coast. Had planned on something else, but our plans changed and we were near Tempe Market Place so we went for a walk around and ended up here. She'd never had Mongolian BBQ before!   Seating is a bit cramped, but ok. Our waiter (Travis) was fantastic. To our table really soon after getting seated. Asked if we'd ever been there (no) and took our drink order. Happy Hour (which is all day!) well drinks $2, score!   He then took us over the main area and told us what to do. I ended up with scallops and shrimp, seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic. Water chestnuts, onions, green onions, cilantro, mushrooms. Sauce was the honey soy. All over white rice.   Food came quickly and perfect cooked! The shrimp was tender and not dried out. The scallops were tasty too. The best part of Mongolian BBQ is that it is so hot when it comes out to you! Excellent flavor all around. My friend had the beef with the citrus sauce and enjoyed hers as well.   Best thing is they don't make you decide if you want the all you can eat or one bowl till the end. I thought for sure I'd want all I could eat, but I was full after one bowl.   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place had such amazing food! I am super disappointed they closed down!! I always do take out, never eat at places like this. It is the perfect food to take home and eat with a loved one while watching a movie. Now we go to YC's, which is very good. But not AS good as Genghis was. But I enjoy Mongolian BBQ a lot. One of my fav types of food to eat."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a top notch asian dish this is the spot. Huge portions and you can design it the way you want.  Staff is super friendly and the GM is a very nice guy"}
{"text":"The food here is great they make it right in front of you and you get to chose all the raw ingredients and your spices and also sauces. The manager/owner is very engaging and friendly. Have been here 2 times and both times has a great experience and service."}
{"text":"Staff was super super friendly in helping us since it was our first time.   It was later in the evening and I didn't expect the bar to be filled, but it was.   Tasty food, prepared right and great service."}
{"text":"Holy moly! This place is amazing! The food is delicious and seasoned just perfectly. They have quite a selection of different Meats and I tried three different kinds and they were all superb! They have a large selection of sauces and mix ins and it has to be the best stir-fry I've ever had. Highly recommend this place I think it's already become our new favorite after one visit."}
{"text":"Ok, I will try to make this painless. If you have never been to a mongolian rest, your missing out. Genghis is trying to be a bit to advanced and I think thats where they went wrong. First of all, I am in charge of what my food will taste like so I can't be upset with the flavor. That being said, my food was delicious haha. The ordering part is what drove me crazy. They have some knock off tablet at each table for you to enter your order in, opposed to the convenentional waiter or waitress asking you for your order. Well, we tried two different tablets and both didn't work. Feeling bad for the waitress as she tried so hard. I don't understand why you have a waitress enter your orders in on a tablet when she could do it herself in half of the time. Give you an A for effort but a C- for execution at best. I don't want to do any work when I go out to eat, if I did I would cook at home."}
{"text":"Awesome! Amazing protein choices! Flavor was fantastic and service was great. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite but \"special occasion\" place to eat is Mongolian BBQ and this place is like a mini verison of that. I was so excited to get some great food during my layover. Airports have improved vastly over the years but still it's an airport. This was definitely one of the better and much more affordable places for something quick."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of my girls!!  Great meats to choose from.  All marinated so beautifully.  Wide variety of spices and vegetables to add to your dish.  Get it over rice or noodles, both are splendid.  Great patio space too."}
{"text":"Mongolian grill cooking is coming soon to Scottsdale!  Genghis Grill will soon open in Scottsdale, in the Promenade Shopping Center.  Currently Genghis Grill can be found in other locations in the valley:  Glendale, Chandler, Tempe and Paradise Valley.  I had the pleasure of visiting the Paradise Valley location for a sneak peek of what is to come in our Scottsdale neighborhood!    Legend states on the battlefields, Genghis Khan along with his 12th century Mongol warriors, used to grill their food on their shields, which were heated by open fires.  Now Genghis Grill brings this legend to Arizona!  Entering Genghis Grill, you are immediately greeted by their hostess who promptly seats you at your table, along with two silver bowls.  Once seated your server comes to your table and welcomes you to Genghis Grill, along with giving a short tour of the Genghis Grill experience.    What is great about Genghis Grill is the ability to make your own creation.  The silver bowl provided to you is your bowl to make as you wish.  A variety of fresh ingredients are available to build the bowl of your liking.  Building your bowl is a five-step process:  1.  Protein (i.e. steak, chicken, seafood) 2.  Seasonings 3.  Veggies 4.  Sauces 5.  Starches (i.e. brown, fried, steamed rice, pasta, tortilla)  Upon assembling your bowl, you walk to the cooking area, where the Genghis Grill chefs are firing up the \"Genghis Shield\".  This is where all food is stir-fried right before your eyes.   When you submit your bowl of ingredients, you are given a number to take back to your table.  This number will entitle your bowl to be delivered to your table upon completion of cooking.     Genghis Grill is a true treat that has arrived in Arizona.  Look out for this exciting restaurant, coming soon to Scottsdale!  If you enjoy my reviews on Yelp, be sure to follow my blog at www.theatewonder.com  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Cant beat it, cheap mongolian food where you make your own dish.  Nuff Said!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the meat and vegetable free for all that is the Mongolian concept but the quality doesn't match the price.  Sorry guys but $14 for that kind of lunch doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Save your money and go to Kyoto Bowl. Our waiter gaves us our metal bowls and then coddled my family like we're children. They have all the waiters follow us to get in line for the self-service buffet. They stand there like if you get out of line, you're bad. Weird...During this time, the waiter goes on and on about their food and what they have. Then when you get to the buffet, the choices are very limited and the food is so full of fluff you don't get to put much food in. Some of it is meant to be like sushi, uncooked, but since you put it in a bowl, it gets cooked with everything else. Oh yeah, and the place is loud. You'll have to sit elbow to elbow to hear your family. The novelty about this place is that you can watch the cooks cook your dismal amount on an open fire oven. That's the coolest thing about this place. They serve it in these trendy lopsided bowls. At this point, the food has really shrunk. The food is tasteless. Anyways, they give you the bill and even though somebody else paid for my bill, I was shocked by the price ~ $10 a bowl. If I had $10, I'd rather go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This location is kinda gross.  Dining area isn't well kept, neither is the food area. Employees acted like we were interrupting their social hour.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant! People complain about the serving size, but honestly if you know how to properly stack your ingredients you can get an over flowing bowls when it is served to you.   The service is great! I love their server Georgina!!! She knows how to take care of her tables irregardless of how swamped she is, she take care of you! Reasonably priced and if you know how to stack your bowl, you will be more than satisfied!   And their rewards programs is pretty on point! Sometimes they have unlimited bowl days.... come hungry leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch. It was pretty good even though I wasn't fully impressed. I really wish they offered salad bar and all you can eat. Most Mongolian stirfry places I've been to in the US offer that. The bowls are extremely hard to fill and I can honestly say I left hungry. Please add salad bar and all you can eat. Also sour cream if offering tortillas."}
{"text":"Idea of this restaurant is great but could be organized differently for efficiency. When cooking several bowls, burnt black pieces are all over the last bowls. Fried rice was dry and flavorless"}
{"text":"Love this place, been so many times and it never fails. Brought my boss here for lunch. Now hes a fan too. Great service too."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place as a go to when in tempe since they opened! It's convenient if your an omnivore, carnivore, herbivore, vegan, vegetarian, and pescatarian! Anyone can eat here.   The service is always amazing here and as quick as it gets for a place that's constantly packed.   The good thing about this place too is you can literally always try something new for exactly the same price. You also don't have anyone but yourself when you're food isn't that great (it's always great though).   A few of my favorite sauce combos: If you like it spicy try the Cajun seasoning with dragon sauce   If you like it garlicky try the garlic sauce with garlic salt   If you like it spicy and tangy go with the kangpoa   If you like it sweet to with teriyaki and sweet and sour sauce.   If you're trying to be healthy instead of rice or noodles go with cabbage (what u always go for).   There is quiet endless options here. You can never go wrong. My favorite is the Cajun chicken and sausage! I always get those. At dinner time I always throw in some shrimp.   As you can see I can go on and on about this place and how good it is but the only way to really know is give it a try yourself!"}
{"text":"I'm 72 years old. I've had good and bad and in between all over the planet. Sometimes you get surprised. Truth is, most restaurants are average. Anyway, tonight I went into Genesis Grill on Bell Rd and without trying to be mean, or just too picky etc, I'm just telling it like it is - \"without a doubt, it is (was) the most disgusting, putrid, foul, down right worst I've ever experienced in all my life\" Seriously. I would go there again FOR ANY REASON. NOT EVER, NEVER EVER!!!!! OMG! Each and every aspect of that garbage dump was horrific. I'm dumbfounded that it is even open for business. BAD. As bad as it gets. Just don't go there, that's all. Anywhere else is better. Seriously."}
{"text":"Looks like they have new owners. They've made some changes.  They are strict about the line.  You have to pay extra to skip ahead and put vegetables first.  I always like to put the vegetables first.  If you put them last they tend to fall off a lot.  It's annoying.  There are three bowel sizes. Which is fine.  No eggs now, which is not.  Those aren't big problems, but it's little annoyances.  This makes me less likely to go out of my way to come here.  There is YC's and others, and they are closer to my home (and my office, for that matter).  If Genghis isn't going to set itself apart it removes incentive to visit.  The ingredients seemed fresh and good.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  So overall I will go with three stars here.  But I won't drive all the way to Tempe anymore.  If I'm nearby, fine.  If not, there's a YC's just down the road."}
{"text":"This location is a \"corporate\" store.  As such they accept all coupons and groupons.  We had a groupon, and the location at Tempe Marketplace wouldn't accept it.  The format is the same, however.  Mongolian BBQ.  A 'bar' where you select what you want in your bowl (meats, veggies, spices and sauces), take it to the cook, and he cooks it up for you.  There are several places that do this (such as YC's).   We found the ingredients here to be good, a nice variety, and the staff was very friendly.  The finished bowls were delivered to our tables cooked and piping hot.  Probably the one thing I have to ding them for is not providing enough starch (in my case, noodles).  Of course I do pack a lot into my bowl (see below for my tip), but still...they should add 50% more noodles than what they do.  Also, YC's usually has a person who will suggest combinations (if you don't already know what you want).  GG doesn't seem to do that.  Tip:  bring a sheet of wax paper with you so you can pack down your bowl.  You'll get more that way.  Also, the veggies should go in first because they will tend to want to fall off the top if you put them in last.  Mushrooms at the bottom (they don't grip on anything).  Meats on top.  Mound the bowl high, you get as much as you can fit onto the bowl for the one price.  So don't be timid.  And, yes, you can take home the leftovers."}
{"text":"Fresh vegetables and meat not to mention a great selection of sauces. One of my favorite places, I go here everyday for lunch. A+"}
{"text":"YUCK YUCK YUCK !!! I don't know what happen to this place new owner or what .  The area where the food was very dirty a lot of meat that was out was still  frozen and  some  looked like it had been sitting all day  nothing was   Filled   Workers were very unfriendly and not helpful ..  When we complained about the food the manager apologized  what a joke !!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat after a late night movie at Harkins. They have great reverse happy hour specials Friday and Saturday from 10pm til close.   It's a great improvement on the whole 'you choosey, we makey' concept. I love how they add the carbs for you later, so you're not standing there with a leaning tower of noodles ready to topple over. Lots of different choices and combinations, but they also have flavor cards if you're ever looking for some guidance."}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat at a place where I get to pick everything that goes into my dish, from the meats, to the spices, the veggies, and the sauce. Even the carb choice! However, when eating here on a busy Friday night, they were out of some items which was disappointing. Also the beef was cut so thin that when it was cooked tasted like ground beef. I don't know about you, but I don't want a ground beef stir fry. The chicken was excellent as were the udon noodles. I say, management needs to over see the food buying and food prep more and they will be good to go."}
{"text":"This build your own bowl grill is a fun place to stop when shopping or seeing a movie. Lots of ingredient options, spices, and sauces available. I recommend thinking about how your flavors will go together rather than just putting everything that sounds good. Food always looks and tastes fresh to me, and it's pretty much cooked in front of you at a large grill.   They have daily drink specials as well as a nice happy hour. I usually sit at the bar and have always had friendly attentive service.   I've been to a similar place in California, but it was much larger and the grill was a main focus. Customers stood and watched as the chef made everything, which he did with a lot of flair and artistry. I wish the cooking was a bigger part of the experience here, but nonetheless it's always good."}
{"text":"We have been coming here on and off for a few years now and this location is the one we generally go to .  I really like the fact that i can control what i put in my bowl.  The only gripe i have is the way the line up is with all the items to create your own bowl, its always hard to reach and always a mess.  They offer white rice, brown rice, fried rice, plus rice noodles, wheat noodles, i like sticking with the brown rice. If you have never been here before, they will walk you threw it, but basically you choose your bowl size and everything you want in it. They cook it up and the server brings it to you. Sign up for the Genghis Grill card and give them your email, you will always get specials sent to you."}
{"text":"So, I must admit...I've never been to any other Mongolian grill. I know, shame on me. What kind of Yelper am I?! Even so, from what I've heard and read...this isn't the place to go for a Mongolian grill experience. I've been here a handful of times and it just seems to get worse every single time.  For the most part everyone who's been here or somewhere similar, you know how it works. But I was here this past weekend and watched 4 different tables get seated without anyone asking if they'd been there before or know what to do. Customers just stand there confused until someone comes back and for the restaurant, that's ridiculous. Sure, it's not hard to figure out but if you've never been anywhere like it, I imagine that's a frustrating experience. I hate their customer service for many other reasons so maybe my opinion is a little biased, but they definitely need to train the employees better. They don't explain anything to anyone, including the fact they you need to go get your own drink.   When it comes to the food, it's fun being able to pick your own stuff and make your own creations but like others have mentioned, they are always out of stuff. Then when it's busy and only one line is open, the whole entire experience just goes out the window because it feels so rushed. Also, I'm not sure if it's a health reason or what...but why is all the stuff so far away from the counter? I have to bend down and reach under that tiny area to get to items in the back. It's all just very annoying to me. The food is okay but I think they overcook everything, again, maybe for health reasons? The meats themselves always seem to be dry and chewy. If you get egg, it's almost like a fried egg that someone forgot to pull off the stove. There's just nothing spectacular.  I think it'll be a while before I go back. The service is crap, the food is mediocre at best and it's expensive. For 3 adults and kid to eat, it cost about $50 without the \"all you can eat\". When it comes down to it, I just don't see this experience or food being worth that much!"}
{"text":"awesome service and great tasting food! tip-pack your bowl until nothing fits anymore! ;)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I came to lunch here with a friend, since he has been trying to get me to come here for a while. I give in and decide to go. As I walk in I am automatically greeted and seated. The waitress showed me three sizes of bowls to choose from (small, medium or large) and explained that I would need to go to this food station and pile the bowl as high as I could with whatever meats and veggies that I wanted, pick any sauces and hand it to the chef. I was honestly intrigued! I for sure picked the large bowl!       When I went to pick my meats, I had to try everything! They has garlic lime chicken, sriracha chicken, beef, pork, Korean beef, crab, calamari, scallops and more! I almost made the whole bowl nothing but meat. I decided to balance some veggies nearly on top. I then picked the two hottest sauces they had. One was a Chile garlic and the other was a sesame soy sauce. After I was finished I gave it to the cook and was asked what kind of rice or noodles would I like with it. If you get the small bowl you get to choose one, medium bowl gets two choices and the large bowl gets three. Since I had the large bowl I chose the Udon noodles, brown rice and spiral pasta. It took about 10 minutes for everything to cook and be served to my table.        The waitress came by our table to get our drink order. I was surprised when she told me that all the specialty lemonade came with unlimited refills! So I ordered the Jalapeño Mint Limeade, the Passion Ginger Limeade and the Raspberry Basil Limeada (made with Raspberry Jam). When my food came out to the table, I was pleasantly surprised on the portion. The taste of the food was flawless. The spicy didn't start living in till a quarter into my dish. The service and food was really impressive. I for sure will be returning soon. The end."}
{"text":"Decided to try this establishment on a Friday night and was highly disappointed. The food was incredibly bland and over cooked. I tried the 'legendary' fried rice with veggies and tofu. The tofu was not prepared correctly (read mushy like mashed potatoes) and the only extra veggies were snap peas. My husband tried the Thai street noodles. It was basically yaki soba noodles with a spice and was clearly not Thai. His noodles were so over cooked they were almost crunchy. Our server topped the experience off with not knowing how to describe the food and alcohol menu. Should have known this place was a bust since there were 3 other patrons dinning. Save you self time and money, don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"I remember when I used to enjoy coming here. Now it's kinda sad to think this is my last time eating here. Besides $14 for a mediocre meal in a setting with music that makes me want to kill myself, and employees that walk around like they don't know what they are looking for. On top of all this, the quality went down, and the price went up. Really sad, at least YCs is still around."}
{"text":"I absolutely Love this place it had great service and never ever let me down it always got my emails correct and I loved when they got the show going you all should try this place do you licious yeah yeah"}
{"text":"This place is fun! They give you a card with your name and table number on it, then you walk through a buffet line to choose your uncooked ingredients. You then leave them to be grilled and eventually returned to you at your table. It's hard to review the food here because you create your own. If you don't like the finished product, well, it's your own fault. It's a matter of trial and error. I've been here 6 times so I know which meats and veggies I like and which seasonings and sauces--there are lots of choices, some spicy, some not, but for me, less is better. I like the teriyaki sauce and the honey soy with a little salt, garlic, and ginger. The important tip is to fill your initial bowl to overflowing because it will cook down. I find the small bowl is enough for me, but they have a medium and a large. You also get to choose what to put you meats and veggies over--white, brown, or fried rice, udon noodles, pasta, tortilla, or cabbage. Our server tonight was Katie and she was very attentive and friendly. As we went up to the buffet line, she said she would check back later to see if we'd done a good job! We had!"}
{"text":"Honestly I didn't think it's sanitize the chicken is raw and out for hours . The veggies are still old and tasted funny we went for dinner 25 $ for 2 people regular size bowl"}
{"text":"I have been doing low carb lately and Genghis is like a low carb paradise : ) You can get your ingredients and have an awesome bowl, as long as you pick wisely and skip the sauce. Well, that is what I do. I add lots of the garlic water, which they said is only garlic... and... the latest surprise, is they added a 'starch alternative', which is sliced cabbage. So when you get to the grill, you can choose cabbage instead of noodles of rice. I thought that was amazing.  Our server was very friendly and I think their goal is for a manager to stop by your table every time. This time we needed sweetener for the iced tea and the manager brought it to us.  We are big fans of Genghis and I do not think they make big fuzz about coupons and stuff. They give you a free birthday bowl every year and their loyalty program rocks!"}
{"text":"As I finished my meal, I could only think to myself, \"Wow....that sucked..........\"   Yet again, this is a corporate bastardization of what should otherwise be a unique, fun, and tantalizing dining experience.  Where do we start?  Well, the decor, layout, and even music was bland.  Any Mongolian images/artwork were badly co-opted, to the extent that they were turned into advertisements for the establishment (insert Lewis Black voice) INSIDE THE FREAKING ESTABLISHMENT!!!  The Mongolian grill, the whole reason one is coming here, should be the centerpiece of the restaurant.  No, it's relegated to some corner.  Granted, this might be for health code or fire safety, but c'mon people, look at all the folks they let sit around the hibachi grill for criminy sakes.  I ordered hot tea.  \"We have green tea.\"  Good.  I spoke too soon.  I got hot water, and a lipton bag of some \"Chai Green Tea\" crap.  No little pot of tea that you find even at your worst of Chinese buffets.   The meat selection:  now, they did have scallops and squid.  Teeny-tiny scallops, the size of a chickpea.  But, none of the meats were shaved.  It was all just piles and piles of stuff what looked like a Klingon would happily choke down.  And no lamb.  Really?  They had pulled-pork bbq.  They had scallops, squid and shrimp.  But no lamb??  Most of the vegetables were Americanized.  Yeah, they had bamboo shoots and the baby corn, but that was pretty much the extent of the Asian stuff.  Then there were the sauces.  Yuck.  It was all stuff that looked like the main ingredient was high fructose corn syrup.  No flavored oils or vinegar.  I was wondering if I was getting Mongolian grill or hot wings.   So, I get my bowl.  It came quickly enough, given how busy the place was.  *sigh* My squid was tough and rubbery.  So were my \"scallops.\"   Now, to their credit, the staff was very friendly and on-the-spot with refills (I also had a water).  Sadly, everything else sucked so bad about this place, the good service does not merit a second star.   Honestly, for the price I paid, I would rather have choked down Chinese buffet sushi.   Oh, and the parking really sucked, too."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been a loyal costumer for over a year. Food is always delicious, the service is normally fantastic and they really treat there registered customers well (i.e. free bowls and special deal)"}
{"text":"I love Mongolian BBQ! I love the concept of where you can choose your own ingredients and stack them up to your liking. Of course, I would always stack it as high as a mountain and there's a strategic way of doing it! ;)   What I like about this place is that they have a variety of meats and sauces to choose from. There was a limited selection of veggies though which was a disappointment. The meat here is fresh, not frozen. Not a lot of places have fresh meat put out for you because usually they're frozen. You are able to sample the sauces before you add them into your meal. I asked the employee working there which ones are the spiciest because I love for my food to be spicy. I found the 3 spiciest sauces that he recommended to me to be not spicy at all. Thank god they had Sriracha.   This place was just ok. You have the opportunity to order and pay from an electronic device at your table. You're also able to create your own bowl or you can order from the menu. There's also games that you can play on the electronic device but you have to pay 99cents for it. Nice concept! The bowls are kinda weird because they were slanted. Not usually my style but change is good. Took awhile for our food to come out to us when it wasn't really busy. Love the big wooden doors right when you walk in! The interior was okay, nothing really special to match the big wooden doors. I've honesty had better Mongolian BBQ elsewhere."}
{"text":"We received an email promo for a valentines special for two bowls and dessert for $24.95. This coupon is very misleading since a dinner bowl is already 9.99 each and the dessert is 4.95! We came during the dinner rush which was   packed and busy. Our waitress, \"Kelly\" gave such poor service in general. The first was getting our drinks after one of our bowls were already made. In getting a refill for us she pretty much dropped the drink onto the table and was gone in a flash. She gave the tab when my date was still in the middle of eating and had to add \"I'm in no rush to take this\" and once again left in a flash. When she came back to collect the tab I mentioned she forgot the dessert with the promo. Before I could say anything else about which dessert we wanted she was gone already in a flash. She brought back a dessert that we did not want or order. My date asked if we get the option picking the dessert which \"Kelly\" responded this is the usual dessert. She apologized saying that she should have asked us and offered to get us whatever we wanted.  At this point I was livid and I said very little. We ate our dessert which to our surprise was very tasty. Our bowls were cooked promptly and we do enjoy the variety of meats , vegetables, and carb options. This is my 2nd or 3rd time at this location and thoroughly enjoy the mongolian bbq experience. The service with all these young waiters really needs to step up a notch or two. I will definitely go there in the future to see if  anything changes with the service."}
{"text":"Love coming to Asian Grills like this all over. But how quickly an establishment goes downhill when you see the staff walking around with their personal phones on their rear pockets. To me it's showing no care or pride working in an awesome place for dinner.  Instantly I knew that the staff will no care about the customers.  As I observed the staff while waiting for our food to be cooked.  My theory was correct.  Even the Host at the door was more degrading to see once you walked into the Restuarant. (You will know once you see the attire she was wearing). Nick at the bar was very nice to make sure our drinks was filled. Kudos to him. And once our food arrived.  I was very happy to smell and taste the awesomeness. Yumm.  Again. Food is great. But some staff members need to change their professionalism and attire. So the Restuarant can match the awesome food they have."}
{"text":"Genghis Grill is such a hidden treasure in Glendale. If you've never tried Mongolian BBQ - stop what you're doing and find your nearest BBQ joint or better yet head to Glendale and come here!  It's super themed inside with gongs and a katana in a shadow box - all red and black decorations. You've got to wait to be seated but the wait is very short. There's a full bar too!  The food choices are endless so go wild with your creative palette! So many meats, veggies, spices, noodles, and sauces to choose from! Add an egg when you get to the grill for a fun little pop of yumminess!! Then grab your seat and wait for them to bring you your food.   Stop in - you won't be disappointed! And sign up for the Genghis club to score free bowls with so many purchases."}
{"text":"Genghis Grill has it all wrong. If I was from Po-dunkville, Arkansas this would be my idea of Mongolian grilling or healthy stir fry. Since it's the shiny, new restaurant in my neighborhood I thought I would give it a whirl. Plus I had to re balance my Yelp chi since my numbers were 210 and 110 and some poor soul wanted to be my friend so it went to 211 screwing it up.   INITIAL IMPRESSION: Too many tables in too small of a space. They tried to seat us in between six full tables while the rest of the areas were open. Not gonna happen homey. Also the lighting is too bright. All good, I bet the food and service is amazing. Hahahaha.  SERVICE:  Service was too much yet it fucking sucked. No one understood what Happy Hour was and they effed up every part of my order accept for the bowl I fucking made.  Every time I had a bite in my mouth they would ask me a question. I did not have a chance to relax and enjoy my meal, yet ever five seconds someone was on my nuts about the experience. Overattentive, yet they still managed to mess up our drink and appetizer orders. Things that make you go hmmmm.     FOOD: For a second just envision raw chicken pieces swimming in it's chicken juice. Then you are expected to scoop a bowl of the meat and slime and mix it in the same bowl with your raw veggies and egg. WTF?! Maybe my OCD was just kickin, but it felt wrong and I couldn't do it. Yes, I'm a complicated order bitches. Thanks for reminding me and making a scene about it.  Big effin deal when I asked for a separate bowl for my veggies and egg. The manager came over to talk to me (without an extra bowl in hand mind you) and give me the Stir Fry For Dummies lecture about how it all ends up in the same place anyways. Do I look like a fucking Mongoloid to you Manager man? News Flash Fuck Face: You lost your stir fry credentials when I peeped meatballs and pepperoni on the line so ba-bye. They do have tons of veggies, eggs, seasonings (mostly seasoned salts) and a variety of sauces (high in sugar) to choose from. If you were from the moon or live off of Hamburger Helper you would think you are having a healthy meal and be super proud of yourself. I wish they would offer healthier choices like raw garlic, ginger and low sodium and sugar free sauces to their selections for those of us who know and watch. They do have brown rice so they get a couple snaps for that.  What whacked out Mongolian Grill place also has spaghetti and burritos?! Genghis does and not in a hipster trendy sorta way either. Penn and Teller would definitely call BULLSHIT. The atmosphere was that of a circus or kid's pizza joint with seven screaming men around the grill taking turns lighting fires and banging on the steel drum. The only way that would work for me is if they were topless with six packs, blue eyes and dancing a little. I'd be throwin hundreds, hundreds.  I found the entire experience to be stressful instead of enjoyable and even though the food wasn't too bad it certainly wasn't worth the price or the extra sugar and calories. An hour later my stomach hurt.   Genghis, you get 2 STARS because I'd rather see your fake stir fry place than a 99 Cent store in my hood any day."}
{"text":"Updating from my previous review years ago.  Prices are higher.  Format changed.  Had a free bowl but didn't see the fine print that they won't apply it to a larger bowl.  Won't even discount the larger bowl.  2 dollars for tortillas that they didn't charge me for last week.  Sad, but I think I will cash in my freebie next week, and I'm done.  Sorry Genghis.  It's been great doing battle with you."}
{"text":"Wonderful food choice for an airport. Takes a little longer than fast food but in under 10 minutes you are on your way with a delicious meal. I have not heard anyone complain, but i like the fried rice special the most."}
{"text":"Place has really gone down hill since they opened.  Protein selection doesn't seem as good (no more marinated steak cubes just crappy shredded beef) and the service is terrible 4 \"servers\" just hanging around the cooking counter.  They could be cleaning the dirty restaurant or checking on customers.  Prices are through the roof 13.49 for a regular bowl used to be 9.99. Won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite resturants but thry never get my order right... I order the pineapple teriyaki bowl with no white onions and everytime I open it at home, there is always white onions... not a huge deal but this last time, my husband specifically asked them to check to make sure there were no onions and the waitress went, checked and came back and said yep no onions... got home... guess what, there were onions... so frustrating when they lie to your face about your order"}
{"text":"Overpriced  This restaurant is overpriced. $11 dollars for a bowl? $3 dollars more for a self-serve soft drink? You've got to be kidding. The best thing here is the pork, can't think of anything exceptional. We have tons of these places in Southern California and only this place here in Henderson, so I suppose I should feel lucky. Still, I can't help but notice the difference between this and \"what's possible\".  It's a good meal, just not great and definitely not worth that kind of money.   Wait for the $6.99 bowl promos in the mail, otherwise avoid."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and had a good experience.  Ingredients were fresh and they barely used any oil on the grill which is a good thing.  My only complaint is that the toppings table could have maybe been a bit cleaner as it had a lot of topping spills from people before me."}
{"text":"Great Place To Stuff Your Stomach!  The only way you don't enjoy your food here is if you do a bad job choosing your ingredients.  You get to load up your bowl with your meats and other choices and then grab some sauces, choose your starch and they cook it up for you.  I don't remember ever leaving disappointed or with any hunger remaining.   This is a truly great place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"So let's not go overboard but this is a fresher choice for food than most. It's a Mongolian Grill with more limited options.   I went for the island teriyaki bowl. Good portion. Fresh chicken. But a little too much of  pineapple which overwhelmed the dish. But I enjoyed having this option and its a good option in an airport.   But truth be told, I'd probably go for the BBQ next door if I only had one choice."}
{"text":"We were greeted by an oldish white lady in her 50's or 60's with an attitude problem as soon as we walked in. She said 'right this way' and I politely asked if my wife and I could sit outside. She seemed to have a huge problem with it, stating that the side door wasn't open.  I have no idea what 'the side door wasn't open' even mean't. She told us to go on ahead and she would follow... I hadn't been to this location, so it took us a while to find the gate around the corner. She kinda just followed us from a distance. Horrible woman who sounded like she really didnt want to work there.  The food was nice, a little too much oil used to cook the stir fry, but it was nice. Next time I'll remember to ask them to cook with less oil, I hadn't been here before, so I didnt know the drill!   The service was probably the worst experience I have ever had in Las Vegas though and first impressions are everything. It was nice, but we wont be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ok, this was tough because the food did a bit of damage to my stomach and everyone else who was in my group. The thing is, it still tasted great! It is obviously Mongolian style and I LOVE these places. You pick it and they make it, so if it doesn't taste right....\"you chose poorly.\"   If you have never been to this type of restaurant before, it is kind of cool. They give you a bowl and you pick what kind and how much meet/protein you want in it. Then you pick what veggies, and other topping you want with it and your sauce. You actually get to make the sauce yourself and that is where you get all the flavor you want.   Then you take it to the stir fry station and they cook it up for you. It is a cool place, and \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"A place you want to be good but it just isn't.  The nightmare begins when you sit down and receive the twenty minute introductory lesson on how to put meat into a bowl.  Then follows the tour of the 8 foot buffet line.  After making your first bowl and waiting another 20 minutes to have it cooked, expect to wait some more for your waitress to bring you your next bowl.  It's not a hard concept, yet they've mastered the art of FAILURE."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good, all the ingredients were fresh and tasty! I would say it is a little overpriced. I think it was like $9 for a bowl and $13 for unlimited. I stuffed my bowl to the max and it was more than enough. And I'm a big eater. Disregard the comments about cleanliness, it is very clean. The pussies that are complaining about that probably shouldn't be eating at a Mongolian BBQ joint. Food gets dropped, deal with it. I saw them wipe down the counter like 4 or 5 times while I was there."}
{"text":"Genghis Grill is one of my favorite restaurants!  I have always enjoyed the \"experience\" of Mongolian BBQ, and Genghis is as good as it gets!  If you're not familiar with this sort of experience, you get a bowl (three different sizes) and follow the steps:  step 1 - select your protein, step 2 - select your seasoning, step 3 - select your vegetables/ingredients, step 4 - select your sauce, and step 5 - select your starch.  Genghis Grill has over 80 ingredients (including a whole egg).    While I always get a regular size bowl, I sometimes upsize it to large and take home enough leftovers for 1-2 other meals.  To be honest, I have never ordered a signature bowl (not even the heart healthy bowl), mains, or salads.  I have only had an appetizer a few times (edamame) and a dessert once (cookie butter).  Otherwise, the bowls by themselves are more than filling!  You can make reservations on Open Table, take advantage of Khans Rewards (and their birthday program), and if you're an ASU student or staff member, show your Sun Card for a discount.  Happy hours are 3-6 PM Monday-Friday or 8 PM to close on Sunday-Thursday.  You can take advantage of different drink specials each day plus 1/2 price appetizers.  I miss the days when there were Genghis Grill locations all around the Phoenix area (which really was only a few years ago), and they used to have more discounts than they do today (including Restaurant.com)."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a number of Mongolian Barbecue restaurants (ie. Wok Wok, BD's, and YC's just to name a few).  I have found Genghis Grill to be the most user-friendly of all of them.  They have recipe cards along with plenty of options for vegetables, meats, sauces, spices, and starches.  The prices are reasonable with great happy hour specials and occasional discounts (including a sometimes Yelp check-in discount of 10% off).  While I see that some of the reviews on Yelp mention poor customer service, I have been to the Tatum & Cactus location nearly a dozen times, always with exceptional customer service.  In fact, in almost each of these occasions, a manager has stopped by a table, too.    The food itself is very good if you follow the instructions to build your own bowl.  You want enough sauce, spices (including salt and pepper), vegetables, meats (unless you are of course a vegetarian or vegan), and starches.  You can trust that it will be well cooked.  Plus, in addition to making your own food, you can also order from a list of appetizers, desserts, and drinks on the menu.  In fact, often, there are surveys on a receipt that are good for a free appetizer on your next visit.  In addition, you want to sign up for the Khan's Rewards, which give you a free bowl every tenth visit (plus double points on Mondays)."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Genghis in Houston about once a week.  I was a huge fan and was totally bummed when I moved out here and they didn't have one here.  However, about a year later, they opened this location.  I could not wait for it to open.  Normally, I try to wait about a month to try newly opened places, just to weed out bad staff, service, etc.  However, I had to go right away.  Right away I was rather disappointed at some of the changes they implemented.  But the food was good and the service was decent.  However, subsequent visits have yielded sub par service.  The past three times I've been there, the make-your-own-bowl bar has been a mess.  They were out of a few things.  They had discontinued shrimp due to issues with their supplier.  I have been very disappointed with this location.  The positives are still the food is great and fresh.  It is a really good deal.  And you can eat as healthy or as unhealthy as you want here."}
{"text":"For the most part, service is always helpful . . . If not a little slow at times. The food is good, hell, hard to mess it up when you create the mix of food. We go often.   My only major critique is that we are regulars, and most of the staff acts like they do not know us. Each time they ask if we have ever been there before . . . REALLY? Kinda bugs me."}
{"text":"UTA: Kelly was an amazing server tonight. Still my son & my favorite spot!  Thanks for hosting a great EKA fundraiser tonight! Austin was stellar! This is one of our favorite spots anyway- always a great meal - but even better supporting our school. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. I love the idea of making your own bowl, and being able to pile on as much as you want. The menu concept and how it is organized is genius! If you're not pleased when you create your own bowl, and not go by their menu, it's your own fault! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The customer service here is excellent and I have never been displeased with the food. The employees are friendly and personable, and I really enjoy every visit. Super fast to go service also. The food is always full and fresh and lots of healthy veggies. The meat is seasoned well and I enjoy customizing my meal and trying new seasonings and sauces."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bowl of Seoul. It was not as good as I expected and it tasted a little bitter. Maybe I should have tried another one."}
{"text":"Have not been too a Mongolian grill in years. This is one of the best. Awesome  with all the different sauce and spice varieties it has endless options. I had firecracker scallops with Dragon  sauce. Yummie!"}
{"text":"Slow food preparation and horrible service.  Didn't offer to do anything for us when it took basically 45 mins to heat up a meal."}
{"text":"Okay... I don't know if they realized that they're starting to lose money with their style of allowing people to select their own selections and portions, but I truly feel as if the bowl are getting smaller and smaller each time I come back to this establishment. What the HELL is going on Genghis??!! I am truly disappointed! :( you can't even pour your own sauces anymore. Now they have a attended grab your sauces for you. How very much frustrating! I have never felt so ripped off after spending $8.99 for a meal.   Let alone our waitress was not doing the place any justice for a decent review out of me.. I felt so rushed! It's the first time I got to experience the check coming out with the food, without asking for it. What kind of operation are they trying to run here now?!?!  Lord please make Genghis Grill go back to the way they used to do thins, so that way there, I can call it one of my favorite places to eat again!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  So many options of food to choose from. Everything kept pretty clean and staff restock food when it gets low. Different seasonings to add flavor to your food. Cayenne pepper is my favorite.  3 different size bowls to choose from so if u aren't too hungry you can get the right amount and not pay too much. One of those places you have to try out."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite places to eat. Great food, people and location.  However I am disappointed in the recent capitalization of the restaurants success.   They now pre-cook some of their meats.  They have initiated a portion control measure by trying to make your bowls for you. They have created tabletop devices to order off of and keep you busy for a fee..... They now have three sizes and have raised the pricing.   I still will eat here, again and again. There is nothing to bag on the food about."}
{"text":"This place is yummy, literally in a bowl. I've been many times, with each combination I make, it's like I'm a first timer. If there was some way I could get every person to try Genghis Grill, the world would be a better place. You just have to be happy, after eating your heart out and still having a full to-go box for tomorrow. Sweet bliss."}
{"text":"I've tried so many of the local Mongolian BBQ places, and though this is the best of the bunch, that's not saying much.  BDs that was in Tempe back awhile ago was the only one I'd go to regularly.  The food choices here are decent, but the service sucks, it smells like urine and BO covered by pine-sol, and they cram too many tables in for it to be pleasant.  The floor literally pulled my shoe off of my foot it was so sticky.  Gross."}
{"text":"It's getting better. The space is crowded and always difficult to maneuver. It feels a little rushed as you're going through. What would help is if if they had those white little plastic sheets to press down some of the vegetables. The employees used to be really bad as far as customer service, but fortunately they fired the old bartender or he left, and replaced most of the staff with members with better attitudes. Most of them are courteous, which is a huge step up from what it used to be. I love the food, prices not so much, but at least it's a quality meal. I wish they would bring back the steak. Also, the unlimited refill on the nice drinks is a good value and they are exotic, tasty, flavorful drinks."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the one in Scottsdale a couple times. Great concept but the preparation of the food kills it. They should cook the food in woks. They use these wooden utensils to cook the food on this flat grill. The meat gets sooooo minced up by the time they are done that it looks like dog food. The beef or chicken gets so minced up that it is all tiny pieces in your meal.   Then the food gets burned on the grill SUPER fast, so after they move it around a few times to cook it, they end up scraping away about 10% of your food cause it is burnt and charred on the grill. Visit and you will see what I mean if you WATCH them cook. Also, seafood like shrimp or scallops cooks faster than meat so if you choose the seafood in your bowl, it all gets cooked at the same time. This results in WAY over cooked shrimps and scallops. And it ends up tasting like crap.   Id honestly say if you want the variety this place gives, go to a GOOD chinese buffet instead for less money and save your money and you still get great variety."}
{"text":"Create your own bowl!  There is never a wait (if there is, it is a small wait).  Plenty of seating.  When you get to the food station to create your bowl, there are posters on the wall that give you recommendations on how to put together certain dishes.  Meats:  They have chicken, pork, beef, and marinated sirloin tips.    Seafood: Calamari, crab, fish  Vegetables: choice of bean sprouts zuchini, green beans, japapenos, and a bunch more (this is all from what I can remember because I'm not really a vegetable person).  Spices:  There are an array of spices you can choose from.  Honestly, I put a little bit of everything and it turns out awesome.  My favorites are the ginger, garlic salt, and lemon pepper.  Sauces: So many to choose from.  When you bring your bowl to the counter, you have your choice of carbs.  I usually go with plain rice.  You can also throw in 1 or 2 eggs (to make it like fried rice) if you want.   At the end of the counter, you can find toppings such as crispy noodles, peanuts, and seasame seeds.  They cook it at the grill, so when you get your food it is going to be HOT!"}
{"text":"I love the food, love the staff, love the overall atmosphere.   All I ask is for more of a hustle in getting seated. Kind of slow with cleaning off tables.   I definitely recommend this place. So good!!!"}
{"text":"The WORST service ever!!!  I stood for 10 minutes waiting while the cashier played. During that time I watched 2 other customers return their food and ask for refunds due to issues with their food. I ended up leaving without ordering due to the long wait, laziness of the cashier, and watching others return their food"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I recently went here with my bf and did not get any meat due to my diet. I thought it wouldn't be as good but it was still delicious! Although, I do with that it was cheaper since we did not get any meat."}
{"text":"Servers are easily destracted. Our server had 3 tables including us and looked to be sweeping the floor across the way. Slow refills on drinks and when I finally asked for our check, she could be seen in the back office room munching out on her own dinner. My bowl items were not well mixed when cooking and I got a bite of nothing but a ball of sauce! We are done and left our \"rewards\" card on the table, they always forget to put points on it anyways. done."}
{"text":"I was totally hoping for a Bill and Teds type Genghis type guy to be running around smashing shit... slightly disappointed when the hostess was a sweet snappy lady.   We were seated and drinks were ordered. We were then ushered to the beginning of the food line and quickly \"learned\" on the art of MSF.  Fill yer bowl with meat, veggies, sauces etc.. give to cook pick rice, noodles etc.   My concern is making my own food taste like shit.. I prefer chefs that know how much chili sauce is too much..   My dish came out good, a ton of steak, some veggies, the Genghis sauce and a little of some other one, and egg or two and some fried rice.   I was concerned about the portion but after concocting... there was plenty!   I did like the meat better here then at YC's"}
{"text":"Totally not a bad place but my experience was a bit tainted by one of the staff. He had his jeans LOW and his underwear hanging out (trendy I know) but he always seemed to be on the verge of losing his britches. He handled his underwear as much as he handled menus and food. Thats an issue.  I would have told the manager but there didn't seem to be one.  This place will get better as it matures and a lot of the initial new hire crew is separated out and we find out who is wheat and who is chaff."}
{"text":"So it's a 4 out of 5 just because they never seem to have enough staff for the amount of people they have and they let the protein get to low before they refill it.  The good, this place is the mecca for the pro eater like myself. Where else can you get over 150 grams of protein for 13?!? No WHERE! The food is great the price is great. Bodybuilder, Strongman,  Olympic Lifter and heck even crossfiters come get your protein load on!"}
{"text":"I thought this play was nothing short of amazing. You prep your own food, but whatever you fit in the bowl is yours for the same price, so I stuffed mine. And there was a great, different amount of seasonings and sauces, and I love that it's not too expensive for the food you get. I live 45 minutes away but that's not stopping me from coming back here!"}
{"text":"Terrible set up. Raw meat juice drips all over the meat selections causing cross contamination. Our server was great but the food was not."}
{"text":"Went to Genghis a few months ago, and it's quite the unique experience. You pick what you want food-wise (they offer suggestions, or you can do it on your own), and place it in a little bowl. It gets cooked and then delivered to your table. I made my own, and frankly, it was disgusting; however, Genghis has a business model that's brilliant. I can't blame them for my food being bad, because I made it! I'll definitely go back again and try something they know is edible lol."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was great and I had a good time the second time I ate there, too, but afterwards when I got home that night and into the next day and a half was not so pleasant. I'm guessing there was some cross contamination from the raw chicken, because the spoon/tongs for the chicken was wet and the raw chicken water was all over the place. I am servsafe certified and I know a dangerous situation when I see it. I washed my hands after filling my bowl and giving it to the cooks, but it wasn't enough. I definitely had a light case of food poisoning. I haven't been back since. I still give them the 3 stars though because it tasted good and the staff is friendly. I really doubt that a situation like mine happens often, but once was enough for me. I think of them every time I open a package of raw chicken now."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times the food was just fine and service was good, albeit a little slow during dinner. My only complaint is the last time we went (and perhaps it was just that time) there was no music, no volume on the TVs, nothing to help drown out your neighbors' annoying conversations. If it's crowded enough, I suppose this could slide since everybody would just drown out everyone else. However, when it's quiet it's  hard to ignore that really loud person three tables away who feels his/her life is so fascinating that the whole world must hear about it! Or, maybe they're deaf in one ear. In any case, if Ghenghis Grill turned on some music, talk show radio, ANYTHING I think it would help with the ambience, and the unintentional eavesdropping.  Otherwise, food is great, service is good, restaurant is clean, and I'd definitely return (with headphones, just in case)."}
{"text":"I chose this place because I was craving some Asian stir fry and this place looked like it fit the bill. I was further convinced when I saw how much cheaper this place is compared to all the other places. So I went ahead and got the Teriyaki chicken.   The service was fast and friendly. However, the food was really really bad. I mean, I couldn't even eat half of it because I couldn't take the taste anymore. It was really sweet, like all pineapple and sugar sweet. That's not what Teriyaki sauce should taste like. The vegetables and chicken that were in there were just not appetizing. And the fried rice was mushy and overly sweet. It wasn't really \"fried rice\". I seriously threw most of it away because I just couldn't take another bite of it.   I don't recommend this place at all but maybe you'll have better luck than I did."}
{"text":"You design your own plate here at the Genghis Grill so it's hard to rate it on it's food. So instead I must base my review primarily on the service, which is fantastic. Everyone here was very helpful and the food was very reasonably priced. Not overly crowded during prime lunch hours but a steady stream of customers came through while I ate and each was taken care of in a very timely and professional manner. I recommend asking your waiter for suggestions on building your own bowl as it is very easy to mess up an otherwise delicious dish with what you think would be a good mix. I experienced that myself the first time I was here with a sausage and Crab fried rice that tasted like nothing but sausage and soy due to me adding too much of each. Great little gem of a restaurant, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really regretted eating here. It was our first and last time going. Service was not unfriendly, but not friendly either. IMO, the employees looked unhappy to be there. You go to a food line and fill a bowl with raw ingredients. They charge a fee for going backward in the line, so if you forget something or decide you want a bit more of something (or like us, were new there and just had no idea and were trying to check out all the ingredients), you're out of luck or paying even more money to add to your half-filled bowl. It was one of the few times a policy at a restaurant actually made me angry. (I regret not leaving at that point.) After filling a bowl, you choose a sauce. You can taste samples of sauce, but with the raw meat/chicken around the food bar, I felt like that wasn't a safe option. Then you go to the cooking station, choose rice/noodles/etc, and they cook and bring it out. The food looked gross and mangled, like they just smashed everything together without care. Flavor was not good in both of our bowls with completely different sauces and ingredients. They served it in those slanted bowls. I don't know what the purpose of that was, but just looked like a way to disguise actual portion size. We didn't finish the food, just paid and left to find a different lunch option.  I'd rather eat at a Panda Express or pay a bit more at a decent Chinese buffet with a mongolian bbq station. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I recently received a response from the owner of this establishment in regards to my recent comments.  It's nice to know that management review blogs about their business!!"}
{"text":"Hmm, reviews seem a bit lukewarm and I can't really figure out why. These guys offer everything you could need or want in a decent mongolian grill (and much more) and I've been pleased each time I ate here.  It's interesting inside. They have a small bar to prepare various well and specialty drinks if you feel the need to get buzzed whilst chowing down on mongolian food. As a previous reviewer noted, it's not particularly comfortable inside-- seems more like a cafeteria style lay out rather than an intimate dining area but I imagine that this style probably fits the casual experience of preparing your own concoction for dinner. They are very friendly here and are more than happy to explain the process to the uninitiated. The availability of healthier options such as low carb or brown rice is certainly a plus for the health conscious.  Now for the food. It's actually quite overwhelming to a mongolian bbq fan like myself because you really don't know where the start. In addition to over half a dozen different meat options, there are many optional spices and far more vegetables than you know what to do with. Plenty of non-authentic options are included, such as as mexican and teriyaki flavors. They have some pre-set recipes for you to follow that will probably make your time in line a lot easier, but being as stubborn as I am, I somehow believe that I can make my bowl more delicious through my own creativity.  You can add a decent amount of meat and they won't complain if it isn't ridiculously excessive.  They add plenty of rice and if you flavored your entree well enough, you don't even require any additional soy or chili sauce. It's not the best mongolian I've ever had but its conveniently located, filling, and served in a friendly manner. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"This Genghis Grill is THE BEST! Let me start off by saying that my BF and I have been to GGs in 4 states and we crave it so badly when we go back to Los Angeles. They don't have a GG in Cali (should be one soon!) so we go whenever we are near one. This one is THE BEST! Seriously. They cook everything great, the shopping center is great, and it really lives up to our expectations. I wouldn't say the staff and/or the atmosphere are amazing, but that's not why we go there. My BF was a little annoyed that they gave him his beer before we went to go get our food (didn't want to leave a drink unattended while we were stuffing our bowls, just in case they tried to roofie my guy..lol) but that's cool. Love you guys!!"}
{"text":"Went here again (7/5) to get my birthday bowl. GG corporate is pretty awesome and they extended my bday bowl a ways to let me get my bday bowl when we were in the area. Props to them for that. There seems to be a wait almost everytime we go there, but this time my veggies were cooked perfectly and my sauce was almost perfect (I put too much salt..dang) but overall it was a great $16 for 2! Love you GG!!"}
{"text":"I usually patron the other similar establishment, however some family that was in town wanted to try Genghis.  It was good, but it could have been better.  It is a bit deceiving as the bowls they give you to fill are rather small...however, if you are a master at the act of balancing...you can totally get your money's worth!   My only qualm is that the meats and poultry pieces are huge.  I have frequented other establishments like this where the meats are very thinly sliced which makes it much easier to pack in that bowl! There are so many choices...steak, seasoned steak, calamari (yummy!) chicken, turkey, shrimp etc.  Veggies and other toppings galore.     I do prefer it when they mix the sauce for me, because I am not always familiar with the level of sweetness, tartness, sourness, spiciness, or whatever-ness that each sauce has.  So this time it was just a free for all...I did end up with a pretty spicy (just my liking) sauce on my dish.  I chose to get steamed rice and rice noodles and it was delicious!  Served with a refreshing glass of Watermelon flavored iced tea (I only got one glass because they somehow ran out of watermelon syrup after making mine!)  too bad cuz that stuff was da' bomb diggity!  We were seated by the window and underneath what I can only describe is an air conditioner that was on steroids and crack!  Yes, we live in Phoenix...yes it's hot here...but man oh man this thing was like sitting underneath an arctic storm in Antarctica!  We had two young girls with us who were shivering...even in all of their pre-Justin Bieber concert attire!  Fortunately, our server was very nice and when we asked if we could have the air Freezer turned off, she quickly obliged!  If that thing had been on when our food arrived, I guarantee it would have gone to steamy to frozen in about 2.3 seconds!  I'll try GG again...I might even try one of their pre-printed recipe cards that are located right before the \"kitchen\"!    Hiiii-ya! (my feeble attempt at being Genghis like)"}
{"text":"I used to go to YC's all the time but this place has been replacing it. I am not sure why... maybe the $1 sake during happy hour?  Anyway, today there was a special for $6.99 bowls so my friends and I went. There's a variety of ingredients like bacon, sausage, pepperoni, chicken, beef, scallops, calamari, white fish, etc. Then there's the veggies and then the sauces.  The portions are definitely smaller than YC's. I still managed to get a pretty good amount of food into my bowl. At YC's, you have a bigger bowl and it's easier to smash everything into it. Here... not so much. But I found a way around it. Build a wall with broccoli and essentially make your bowl twice as big. It's a work of art and architecture in the end.  Sauces and flavors are good. Variety. Nice place to hang out with friends. :) Just make it work your buck. Pack it in!"}
{"text":"I made a pretty positive review prior and was pretty happy. I went back to get another bowl cuz I was craving it and I can honestly say I am a little annoyed with this place this time. I put madarin oranges in my bowl both times I have come cuz I like the sweet with the spice I put in, and both times they have been removed from my bowl. Why do you offer them if you are just going to remove them? I also requested both udon noodles and fried rice....no rice at all, both times I have been here, and very little noodles. So admittedly, although I like this place and think it is good, I was not as happy this time. Especially when I came in and expected to pay lunch time prices and paid dinner prices instead even though it was about 11 something when I went."}
{"text":"We come here all the time and always get served by Mike the bartender. He's super friendly and makes our dining experience so much more enjoyable! Food is always awesome too. We love Genghis!"}
{"text":"I find it laughable what one of the reviewers below said. $8.99 is nothing in comparison to the prices at Stir Crazy in Illinois and other similar concepts, but I guess ignorance is bliss. Not to mention piling up a bowl like that with the raw meat on top cheats the restaurant as it is technically another meal. But I digress.  Genghis Grill is a casual Mongolian stir fry joint, similar to Pei Wei or the hibachi station at an Asian buffet. There are a good variety of meats and veggies to choose from. I understand why the sauces have to be attended; I wouldn't put it past a stupid customer to dip a finger in a sauce otherwise. Not to mention if you put too much sauce, the amount of sugar in certain sauces can burn and screw up the meal.  I pieced together a meal of udon noodles with chicken, veggies, and honey soy sauce. I enjoyed it and can't complain--a regular size bowl left me stuffed.  The waitress was nice and prompt with our requests, although another one came by later and kept saying \"K\" after the two things we asked for.   Overall, I like the place since you can control the amounts of which ingredients go into your meal. Despite it being Friday evening, there wasn't a terribly long wait and our food came back cooked quickly."}
{"text":"We went to Genghis Grill today at Tempe Marketplace and were helped by Edwin. We had a large group of coworkers during our lunch visit and there were a lot of moving pieces between drink orders, food delivery and special requests and Edwin was more than patient and attentive! He took great care of us and didn't miss any of our requests. I've been to this location several times and this was by far my favorite visit. Thank you Edwin for making our visit exceptional!"}
{"text":"Food was great as always. If you want to eat healthy and have amazing flavor. This is the place to be! Such a large variety and options! I was stunned on how great the customer service is here. I will always put this on the top of my lunch and dinner options."}
{"text":"Great concept with endless options. Love the ability to craft your own dish and get everything just right. Ingredients are good and I have not been disappointed with a meal in my several trips here."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great service, great vibes... all A+++.... but I just can't shake the feeling that the place isn't kept up with very well--- dirty, grungy, with butt cracks every place you look"}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to admit that I stuff my bowl to the hilt with food. Greedy yes but I want to make sure I have enough protein and veggies and the bowls seem so tiny. (Hey I said I was greedy) the service is always pretty good and the selection for you to choose is great.  Needless to say due to me being greedy, I always have leftovers. At least I am not alone when it comes to stuffing my bowl as I have seen others that are 10x worse than I am. Join their Genghis grill club for some awesome deals you can receive on your bowls."}
{"text":"Decent stir fry for this type of place. Not my favorite type of food, but it got the job done. I liked being able to choose your starch, including cabbage if you're low-carbing it, and the servings were pretty generously-sized. Plus you have the option to make it bottomless for an extra $5 apiece or so. The sauces seemed bland, but maybe I didn't mix mine like I should have.  Service was...odd. Not bad considering it was pretty crowded. Our waiter was super friendly, but when we went up to fix our plates the servers bussed and cleaned our table. It was all cleared off when we went back, and the waiter was as confused as we were. It made me glad I had taken my purse up with me, and glad there weren't people sitting at our table when we came back. The whole place was a bit loud for my liking, but between the crowds, the fans, and the sounds of cooking that isn't really surprising."}
{"text":"Alright boys and girls, look at my picture and let me explain how it's done. The trick is to make sure you add the vegetables first.  When you are in line it will be the meats, however skip and go straight to the vegetables THEN pile on the protein. This will allow you to have the best leverage on putting as much and high into one bowl as possible.  They do not discriminate, whatever you can get on the bowl you are good to go! You can also just go all meat if you are not much of a vege lover... Make sure you get a regular size bowl and if done right, you will eat plenty enough there and have the exact same portion you ate if not more to take home for leftovers!  Also for the best flavors, add a lot of different combination of sauces and ask for both rice and noodles as well as a cracked egg!  This place is very valuable, we come here often and if you have a Ballantyne card you get a discount during lunch hours. Love this place and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The Mongolian mule adult beverage was delish!!!!   Caution as it is dangerously delish!   We arrived on a Sunday and it was packed!  But service was still fast!    This is a Hidden secret!!!!"}
{"text":"Really great place. We have eaten there about 4 times now.  It's a fun place and the food is really good.  Reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in and didn't really know what to expect. I guess I was going to compare it to YC's but it's really not the same. Genghis is a sit down restaurant where you create your own bowl, add sauce and they cook for you. I liked the selection of proteins, veggies and the array of sauces. I had someone helping me on all my selections and really enjoyed being able to sample sauces. When I got to the cooking station, I liked that you could add extra ingredients (I chose an egg). Service here was really great and I enjoyed my bowl!   I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday with my wife. It was an hour before closing but the staff were still very very welcoming. Erin, who was our waiter that time, was very entertaining! We really had a good laugh! The guy who cooked the food was awesome too! 5/5 will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Healthy food great service server Wendy explained how it works took us on a small tour on how to begin a bit confussing for those who had never done the Mongolian Style of filling your own bowl with choices exp. before.  Being that I had this exp. before it was slightly different since I was expecting a bowl to fill up the choices before grilling as they had a choice of silver plates asking you if you would like small, medium, or large.  Well I chose medium started to fill my plate with choice of Siracha Chicken and when I t was time to pick out the spices just have fun with it do not get technical choose what excites you same with the veggies whatever catches your eye and at the end when it comes time to choose your sauces for flavor do half of one choice in your side cup and add half of another flavor sauce choice in the same side cup.  Finally when you get to the grilling area again do not get techinical have fun I did half Udone Noodles and half Brown Rice.  Quite enteresting dish when the server brought our food I created a very flavorful exotic and fun mix as long as you do not get techinical just choose what appeals to you and do now worry how it will come out and that is how I will say you will enjoy this place have fun and just get creative with your choices!  If you get to techinical you will miss out on the exp. of having a creative dish that you just invented and do not worry everything is great here so sure to be flavorful!"}
{"text":"first time here, definitely won't be my last. my bowl was awesome, and the jalapeño shrimp cheesy bread was delic!!!  my cocktail of choice was the warrior smash, simply groovy our waitress alyssa is a rockin' !!! her energy is so positive and radiant ghengis grill is very lucky to have her, kudos"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is a little short on people and they forgot a lot of things. But still a great family establishment."}
{"text":"My wife loves this joint , but every time we go (3x's total) the service is pretty sub-par...I dig the whole concept of \"building your own bowl\" but when that place gets a little busy they get less productive (behind the grill and in the floor)...the only plus about the joint I can say is that they have that bad-ass beverage machine that lets you go wild and release you're inner mixologist !!...food's decent tho service could be better tho."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this location because I just could not resist Genghis, and it started off okay, but when we went to put our ingredients together, I was waiting almost 2 minutes for an employee to get done dumping new (FROZEN, ZIPLOC'D) meat before I could grab any to put in my bowl. he didn't even apologize for the wait or acknowledge my presence. Once I had my frozen (mixed with soggy and old) meats, I moved on and sat down. Our waiter was not attentive or energetic at all, it seemed like he hated his job which brought down our enthusiasm. And to top it all off, my boyfriend woke up the next morning sick as a dog from the food we ate the night before. This bums me out because now I won't be back to any other Genghis Grill."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were disappointed with the service tonight. Our waitress Victoria avoided us on purpose and was more interested in talking to the bartender all night. She would offer refills to people around us but skip us. I've been coming to this location since 2011. We will definitely not be back! I celebrated my 21st birthday here and fast forward 6 years, the service is really bad."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food is very good. However, I have also been to YC's, which is the same type of mongolian grill cooking, and I'll have to say, I prefer YC's. Pro's of Genghis is that there are more meat, veggie and carb options, but you get a WAY smaller bowl to begin with. YC's cooks your food when you're standing there and  then you take it to your table, Gengis has you go to your table, then they serve it to you. This didn't work very well when there was a group of six of us and there was about a 20 minute wait form when the first bowl came out and the last.  Basically, the food is great, depending on what you make. Price is a bit high and the wait is a bit long. I would suggest coming here in a Wednesday afternoon with no more than two in a party."}
{"text":"On 12/17/2014, i visited genghis grill for the 1st time. I dined at the Tempe Marketplace location with friends and family.   Upon entering the 'food line' to determine my bowl size and select my food ingredients, i immediately noticed the vast amount of food and debris on the floor in front of the food selection area, which was certainly not a positive impression of my 1st visit. During the length of our entire dining experience, that floor area was never cleaned up.   When selecting my bowl size an employee assisted but constantly inspected the bowls for cleanliness prior to distributing them to the customers and 'discarded' about 25% of the bowls on the 'clean' shelf. This made me uncomfortable because if the employee could not trust that the items would be clean, how could I?  Reaching the food selections located in the rear of the display cases was actually impossible to do so while maintaining proper hygiene. Because of their location in relation to the plastic sneeze shield, most customers including myself had to actually duck under the shield and reach our entire upper bodies under the shield to reach the food items in the rear of the display cases. This made the food selection process very difficult because the height clearance did not allow for much room to reach the food items in the rear of the display case  Many of the food items were in very low supply and we had to ask the employee to refill many of them, such as the spices, vegetables and sauces. I asked myself, 'Why aren't these items more constantly monitored by the employees to maintain proper food levels?'  my food was cooked and actually delivered with some burnt remains from what appeared to be an unclean grill surface or burnt remnants of another source.  I relay this information to you because i feel this location needs immediate attention and for the staff to be properly trained or retrained.  I am very disappointed by my 1st visit to any genghis grill."}
{"text":"Austin is a horrible server!!! We were sat and waited 15 mins. Kept making eye contact with our sever & he kept running off! To top it off, they seated a part of 5 AFTER we had been waiting 10-15 minutes and he immediately went to them!! I like the food here but we walked out on him & didn't order anything...feel like never coming back after Austin's horrible customer service & serving skills!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. The food is delicious and very filling. I have only ever ordered the regular and walked out stuffed. They have a large variety of foods and flavors you can  add to your bowl. I like that it is made with exactly what I want. Yes they have cards that give you some recipes, but why not go crazy and try your own concoction. The staff is always friendly and helpful if it is your first time."}
{"text":"I like the Mongolian Barbecue concept... I really do.  So, when my friend suggested we head to this place for dinner, I was all about it.  I read the reviews that came before mine, and tried to be optimistic too...   And while it appears that GG has addressed the complaints about not being vegetarian or food allergy friendly, they can't do much about the chain feeling one gets upon dining here.  They can, however, work on their service, which was unattentive and unorganized during my visit.  My friends and I went up to prepare our bowls at the buffet.  I prepared mine with shrimp, calamari, imitation crab meat, vegetables, egg, and a mix of honey soy and spicy sauce.  I handed it over to be cooked up and put on brown rice, and it actually turned out pretty decent.  I ended up deciding I wanted to go up for seconds.  This was after our waiter just threw our check down at our table without asking if we wanted anything else.  My friends went for dessert and I went for another bowl after that.  I guess our waiter took the check back when we flagged him down to let him know this.  I was busy finding the hostess to request a new bowl for my second helping.    I had to ask several times after that for some more water, and when I was waiting for my cooked food to be delivered, the food runner attempted to deliver the wrong bowl to my table, even admitting that sometimes they get the numbers mixed up... not a good sign.    If you like dining at places like Sweet Tomatoes, (not that there is anything wrong with that... I even hit up Sweet Tomatoes every now and then), this place could be up your alley.  At dinner, it's $9.99 for one trip to the buffet and $13.99 for a bottomless bowl.  If you drink and/or have dessert though, it can get pricey for what it is, but again, the concept is solid... there is something for everyone to choose from whether you like meat, chicken, fish, noodles, rice, etc...  I would suggest GG do a better job with training their servers and keeping the buffet bar stocked and clean.  I'd also suggest they do something with recipes for sauces as we all just guessed on how much sauce to use and made our own combinations of ingredients.  I have experienced better, but I'm not saying I'd never go back.  Just go in with lower expectations (it's not going to be a gourmet experience by any means), and you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"The service is good and I love the bowl of meat and sauces. The dinners are a overpriced so I had to give this place three stars. For the same dinner price (or even a dollar more) you should get all you can eat like it used to be. Also I really struggle with tipping here as you put together your bowl and get your own drinks but you're recommended to give 15% -18% on the receipt."}
{"text":"Eat here every couple months and is a great place to get an affordable Asian fix. The restaurant GM is amazeballs, is extremely friendly and accommodating, She makes the visit all the more worthwhile. The food is as good as the ingredients you choose. Worth the visit for lunch or dinner,"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience at Genghis Grill! Was greated by four people when I came in, continuously checked on, and even checked on by four different people!  Everyone is always so nice, helpful and polite! 5 stars for customer service! Oh, and my bowl was perfect too!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good, not great.  The price is rather high for the quantity you get, particularly if you're mostly a veggie eater.  The service is good."}
{"text":"I hate these kinds of places where you have to pick out your own food and flavors, but against my better judgement I went anyway. I should have listened to my gut and found something better around the corner. Of course my food was TERRIBLE and instead of being able to be upset with the chef, I had only myself to blame.   I could have made my own terrible pedestrian stir fry at home!"}
{"text":"I've read the bad reviews from people who have actually eaten there, but I was another \"walk-out\" before trying. I knew there would be a problem when the server tried to tell me how simple it was. \"Just pick your protein\" she said several times.  Next she admonished to pile on the vegetables because they \"shrunk down to nothing!\"  So, I was handed this tiny bowl that had to accommodate both!  What should I do? The last time I had so much pressure was a Vegas timeshare presentation!  I had an idea, go with one of the bowl suggestions on the board behind me.  So I said to the kitchen helper, \"make me a Korean Bowl, please.\"   Her reply was \"you do that, the description of ingredients is only a guide.\"  My wife said, \"ok, where's the scallops?\"  That was when she was told they only had them at night.  Genghis Khan was a barbarian and true to its name, this place was pretty barbaric. Fortunately, we escaped with our lives!"}
{"text":"We met here for lunch.  First of all there were no shrimp. Then we made our choices,  between the coming stone and our table,  our meat/ fish choices had disappeared and then we got bowks that were not ours.   The manager told my elderly mom that her name sounded Like that of a man. Very tactful!  Not a good experIence."}
{"text":"The staff was not very informative.  The bowls were too small for the price. Had trouble fitting all of the food in the bowl without spilling it everywhere.  Hard to reach the ingredients in the back.  The buffet area was too messy and did not appear to be regularly maintained. Wasn't worth the $10."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and the bartender blatantly ignored us. She made drinks literally right in front of us and didn't even look at us. She finally greeted us unenthusiastically and my friend ordered a beer. She didn't even ask me what I wanted. My friend drank her entire beer and the bartender never took my order. More guests sat at the bar and she ignored them too. My friend left a $5 on the bar for her beer and we walked out."}
{"text":"I have to say i was very happy with the service this time around. They have new owners and i love the new settings inside. It is more personalized where the server actually calls your name instead of a number and it looks alot more organized and cleaner. I will be going back because im once again a fan of the service."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and our server Nick was incredible at taking care of us and very friendly. We like customizing our own bowls and the kids always eat it all! Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I pass by this place all the time, but that was a mistake by my part. The food is piping hot and very tasty! And jaakko's served us well. It's fun to eat because you get to fill a bowl with raw ingredients, and watch the cooks prepared for you. The rice was a little dry but the noodles were so good. Look at the pics"}
{"text":"This and YC's are some of the only Mongolian places I have tried here in the Valley, and I think they are somewhat comparable. I like both, each has one or two things going for it that the other doesn't. At YC's they have a self serve soup and rice bar that I really like, fresher veggies, more options of veggies, bigger bowls, and the prices seem much better. Genghis has some yummy spices, fresher meat, more options of meat, and I like the sauce a lot (dragon sauce). Because I was comparing Genghis to YC's, I felt like it had a few short comings, but because it was good, it is hard to complain.   I had a very kind waitress who talked with me a little, which I appreciate cuz I was eating alone while out running errands.   I had chicken, Mongolian veggies (bell peppers and onions, cabbage, bok choy, cilantro, jalapenos, squash, dragon salt, dragon sauce and brown rice. It made a great stir fry, and the watermelon iced tea was sooooooooooo good.   It was hard paying $16 for lunch just for myself when I could have eaten at Greek wraps across the street for maybe $7 or Jersey Mikes for $7ish also. Or made the same thing at home for maybe $3. Lunch should be cheaper in my opinion."}
{"text":"Have had a hard time finding a mongolian bbq place in the Vegas Valley and I am very happy I found this one. It's not the best I have had but I am so grateful at this point to have this one it's perfect.   P.S. The service is very good. Very polite, friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Great lunch option for a family or work group. Seating does get a bit crowded (and service has been a bit spotty), though."}
{"text":"Random visit as I was shopping at the Tempe Marketplace and Asian cuisine was on my mind! The original location I visited was years ago at the paradise valley mall area, which has since closed. Good to know this establishment is still around ! I love how you can make your own bowl and smash as much as you like to appease your cravings. I honestly don't quite remember what i mixed in my medium bowl besides the main ingredients of steak and scallops. I do know I added garlic , greens if some kind and had to have an egg mixed with my fried rice as the chefs go to work frying my concoction to this meal you see attached ! Great to see that genghis is still around !"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Happy hours are $1 for a pint of beer! Filling and worth spending $20 on food and few drinks. Whatever you dump in your bowl is totally your choice. So be wise! :)"}
{"text":"Gone down hill since they opened.   Used to be my favorite spot.   It's become filthy. Yesterday ate with my boyfriend and both got sick and still today suffering.   My Roomate on a different occasion had the same issue..  Clean it up, get more organized and it'll become golden!"}
{"text":"I definitely consider myself a regular at this location, and I love each visit! The restaurant is always very clean and not busy, which creates a GREAT atmosphere for conversation. All the waitresses/waiters are very polite and well trained, I enjoy when the owner (or manager?) is there walking around and asking about your service. It feels like a family owned restaurant despite it being a chain.   The customer service is awesome! I came in directly after a knee surgery and the staff were extremely accommodating to me and my family.   My only complaint is the take out side. The last two times I ordered it was not good at all and sloppily thrown together. I'm hoping this gets better over time!!"}
{"text":"Genghis Grill, after my 1st bad experience a year or so ago I swore I would never come back,,,but was at Tempe Marketplace with my daughter who said she was hungry and loves Genghis and since she was buying, she said that's where we are going. So I went, hesitant.   Walked in and it was a different experience this time! The floors & tabletops were not sticky and the counter top was clean.  I was starting to enjoy myself.  So started to make my bowl, I went with the festive chicken and steak, decided that I will follow whatever my heart desires, added a mix of sliced bell peppers and onions, then some mushrooms, jalapenos, pico de gallo (note to self, don't add that again, it has chopped baby corns which freak me out, cuz really were is corn growing only 3 inches long and as skinny as a pen), green onions, some cabbage? Tossed in some red chili flakes and hit it with more spice and fiery hot sauce before turning it over to the grill got it with some fried rice. That was some heaven right there, delish I tell you!!  The one who wound up cooking my food on the grill even told me man that looks and smells great!   Ok I can say I am glad to have gone back a 2nd time and most likely will be back again."}
{"text":"Went to Genghis Grill to redeem a free birthday bowl and this was my 1st time at this location, I have to say the set up inside is nice.    Went to go get my bowl made, and when I got their a young man asked me what types of meats I wanted, and he was serving them into the bowl, and I thought oh, this is different guess he is putting my bowl together for me, and after he placed the meat into the bowl then he gave the bowl to me to finish up with it, which I did, just wonder why I wasn't able to put my own meat in, because I would have added much less than what I got haha. Even though I am a carnivore, I do love my veggies and I just feel Genghis just doesn't offer much in the veggie department. But they do have Udon noddles which I happen to love!  My lunch bowl was good, service was friendly, and glad to stopped by and added them to my lunch time list!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.   Food service is ok. Prices are high for what you get.   Waiter for drinks was bartender.  Can't get the guy to give us more sugar.  He's watching tv.   Music is okay.  Decor is good."}
{"text":"We crave places like this in our family. We have various family members who are vegetarian, don't eat red meat, need a gluten-free diet, or are simply uncertain what they want to eat. Genghis Grill is the choice we make for all of these situations. As noted before, if you don't like your bowl, it is your own damn fault, since you picked everything out.  The gluten-free ones appreciate the sauces which are without gluten (since the problem is greater than simply paying attention to the grain used in the starches). The ones who don't eat red meat are happy with the fresh chicken and seafood items for proteins. The vegetarians like the selection of fresh vegetables and sauces without meat.  Me? I am none of those above. I just like making a bowl the way I want it and eating a nice dinner. It might be a little louder inside than I would prefer, but not as bad as some other local spots.  The other night, three of us were $35 before tip, not including the two glasses of wine. That makes GG a little more expensive than Pei Wei, but in return there is the luxury of having everything the way one wants it, along with the knowledge of the ingredients which go into the bowl."}
{"text":"I've only been to a Mongolian Grill once, but this was my first time here. If you're a newbie like I was, the server explains what to do:  1. Choose the size of your bowl  Pile as high as you can -  2. Meats 3. Spices/seasoning 4. Veggies 5. Sauce(s)  6. Then bring your bowl to the grill area (be careful not to spill anything) 7. Wait for your dish to arrive!  It may seem a bit overwhelming at first since there's so many to choose from. But if you know what you typically like, and after sampling the different sauces, your bowl should come out tasty.  Everything was delicious, except my veggies seemed undercooked.  I recommend to mix your bowl before eating since majority of the sauce stays on the bottom, and get 2 sauce containers for a regular sized bowl (3+ for the large bowl).  The price is very very reasonable! The prices are around: Small = $10, Regular = $11.50, Large = $13 The serving size is HUGE!!!! A regular could feed me twice... And I eat a lot.  The service was average though. My party arrived 1hr before they closed (closing hours were earlier from what was noted in Yelp), so the server was in a bit of a hurry & we had to rush our stay. Nonetheless, we still had a good experience.  I'd definitely come back to create a different bowl!"}
{"text":"FAITHFUL FAN   I am trying to get all of my friends off of YC's and on to this place- because it's AWESOME! Instead of gross frozen meat, Genghis Grill keeps all of their protein and veggies fresh. I don't eat meat, so I also appreciate that Genghis always has Shrimp, Calamari, Scallops, Marinated White Fish, and Krab Imitation for me to choose from :) They have a very wide selection of veggies and fruits, lots of seasons for spicing- and an delicious choice of sauces!! I probably try a new sauce everytime, and have never been disappointed! I also appreciate that they have marinara sauce and spiral noodles for my friends who are weary of asian food.  They also have AMAZING DRINK SPECIALS :) I had a two dollar mimosa this afternoon.  $1 Sake $2- Wells, Mimosas, Bud Light Drafts & Sweet tea Vodkas $3- Domestic Beers & Skyy Vodka $4- Bloody Marys, Import Beers $5- Sake Bombs and Jager Bombs..  They serve happy hour priced drinks all day Sunday-Thursday and Friday and Saturday until 7pm.  Definitely the place to get your cheap drink on at Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming to this location. First, they have completely changed the menu.  They don't carry shrimp or scallops any longer.  But the manager feels pork is a good substitute.  Also, they are out of sausage at 7pm on Friday with a 1/2 empty restaurant. According to the manager, \"they were just busy\" though.  And to top it off, the manager is an argumentative ass when asked about it! IJS"}
{"text":"The options are pretty good and they cook the food pretty damn quick. I'd definitely say this is s good place for lunch. They have a bar also which is nice. Staff is awesome as well."}
{"text":"The layout is simple.  Walk in, host greets you and seats you.  If you have not been there before then the server is flagged to come walk to through their process.  If not then you are off on our own.  Server came got our drink order and walked us through the process.  Our server Brittney was awesome!  We picked our meats, added spices, picked our veggies, and then sauces.  I got beef, chicken, garlic spice, tofu, baby corn, and water chestnuts.  I added the soy honey (too sweet for me).  I picked all of my stuff to go with udon noodles.  It was ok, was not the best I have ever had.    We also ordered a cheesecake for dessert.  It was good.    Later talking with the manager, Andrew.  They have been open for 2 months, they are still working out the processes of the place (understandable)."}
{"text":"We have dined here many times and after eating lunch here today, I'm not sure I would go back.  Things seem to be going downhill. The sign on the front door said they were out of a few of their sauces, not a huge deal, but strange and we were at least informed before getting in line.  The area where you make your bowl wasn't well stocked and they were even completely out of a few things.  The sauce area was VERY messy and needed to be wiped down.  Nobody was behind the area to service it   We ate around 3pm, and eventhough they weren't busy, they were behind on the cooking of the bowls.  The whole cooking area looked dirty.  The hand washing sink next to the grill was broken and spurted water up onto the wall and caused the floor to be wet.  Used metal bowls and dropped food debris could be seen on the floor as well.  The whole place needed a cleaning and some repair work.  An upholstered booth seat was heavily torn and the black tape used to cover the holes had been there long enough that it was peeling up and almost gone.  Why not get something liked that fixed?  Even the edge of the red bowl my food was served in was chipped. Lunch for 2 with sodas was $40 including tip. The food tasted fine and the service was average, but the lack of cleanliness and normal maintenance makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"Genghis Grill was definitely an interesting experience. When you enter they give you a bowl which you fill up with meats, vegetables and other ingredients (hint: fill that bowl as high as possible because the meat will shrink). Afterwards you pick your sauces and your starch. They even bring it to your table when it's ready. For a price like $9.99 for a bowl you'll realize that it fills you up very quickly. I followed the beef and broccoli recipe and I ended up taking half of it home in leftovers which, by the way, taste even better when you eat them the next day."}
{"text":"Awesome place and great food!! Service was amazing and staff was very helpful and accommodating, been here with friends and with kids in different occasions. One of our go to spots when visiting the area! Do not miss out on some great food and great service."}
{"text":"Great place to go to with friends and coworkers in Tempe Marketplace.  Food quality and service is alway top notch!"}
{"text":"I went here with a co-worker for lunch and it was fine. Not great, not bad... just what you would expect from a Mongolian grill restaurant. The service was exceptional. I strongly feel that the food was extremely overpriced. A small bowl during lunch hour with a soda and 18% tip will set you back over $16! WAY too much for a bowl of stir fry, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite in town. However since i first started going there they have frequently upped the prices while making the portions smaller. Great quality and selection food-wise, but a bit pricey..."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I have ever had from a restaraunt. The guy on the grill was fussing at the other employees the whole time I was there and the food was terrible. I would  stand around and watch for someone to finish eating something else, then take over there plate, before I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Not good!  If you love Genghis Grill, do not go to this one.  The quality compared to Tempe Marketplace is by far much lower.  They only have a third of the vegetable choices and they won't even let you make your own sauce. The rice was stale and the worst part is they pre cooked the chicken. Awful just awful.  Now, I go to Genghis enough that I make the same meticulous bowl every time. It's awesome by the way. But this place practically made my bowl the way they wanted it and it was awful. I'm pretty particular about my Genghis.  I will say the service was very good but the quality was not."}
{"text":"I was having a lovely dinner until the server decided to ignore us . He kept chatting with the bar staff and cooks. We saw the server for the table next to us pass by like 10 times and ours would never come back. Next time I will get a to go order because I will be back for the steak!"}
{"text":"Not what I'm used to for Mongolian food. The meat was pre-cooked (I'm used to the frozen stuff) which I felt didn't pick up the sauces flavor. One of the charms of mongolian is mixing your own sauces to create something unique for yourself. Think you can do that here? Absolutely not. Being used to pouring my own sauces I grabbed the ladle to get my sauce which was ripped out of my hand and explained they don't put sauces on the grill.   At our table they had little tablets where you could purchase games and actually check out and pay for your meal. Even with the option of splitting the bill. Do you think that service worked? Absolutely not. We tried splitting the bill where only one person got to pay using the device, my bill wouldn't go through, my best friends bill only partly paid. We asked for assistance and no one knew how to fix it. It's a great idea that just wasn't executed.   If you're looking for true, yummy, make your own Mongolian.... keep driving past this place."}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried Mongolian food and I'm glad that it was Ghengis grill! I just loved the food..I liked the idea of customizing your bowl and it is cooked right in front of you! I just made random guess of sauces and it turned out to be yummy..and the waitress was kind enough to consider ASU discount after the billing..Can't wait to visit Ghengis again!"}
{"text":"Totally love their fun mongolian establishment! It is self serve, but they've got all the cool stuff, and an extensive selection of ingredients to choose from! So much you'd be so undecided on what to choose. So...after coming here a few times already, here's my advice:  1.) THE DREADED SILVER PLATE: They give you a silver plate which looks really small and depressing because halfway through filling your silver plate with stuff, you realize that the silver bowl is wwwaaaaayyyy too small, and you'll learn that really quick once you get your cooked food since they all shrink down to size after being cooked. MY SUGGESTION: pile high. no joke. PILE HIGH. don't be shameful. don't second guess. Yess....this is your game of jenga or tetris with food. Pile as high as you can. If you have to smush with your hands do it (it's not a crime to pile high nor is it a crime to take your time, people can go around you...).   2.) TASTE TEST YOUR FLAVORS! You can taste as much sauces as you'd like, and you can mix them. If you're not sure try them, and! The fun labels tell you EXACTLY what it pairs well with.   3.) INDECISIVE? DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START? No worries, in the beginning of the line they have fun recipe cards you can use and to help you start so then if you're looking to put in your flavor...you can play around with it. Think of it as an inspiration card.  4.) CHOOSE YOUR STARCH: I usually go with the brown rice. I love that that they have brown rice and I'm sure you healthy eaters will too. Think it's not enough? You can request for double!  5.) SELF SERVE COKE MACHINE: High five selling coke products, but even more of a high five for having that cool new digital coke machine! Mix and match every flavor known to man! You'll be sure to be indecisive in a drink here too.  6.) SUPER COOL TOUCH PAD: Here, you can split your tap with your lunch date and fun touch pad games while waiting.  **I love that this brings an opportunity to just get creative. You can be really interactive with it.  It does get busy during lunch, and the wait does take some time, so if you're in during your lunch break, expect that your meal won't come out in time for you to get back to the office."}
{"text":"Freshly made, big portions and great taste. Ohh almost forgot, cost less than the bottle of water and chips I purchased at the Cancun airport for $10."}
{"text":"never going back! they're chefs cannot cook. although I did enjoy the whole concept of building your own dish.  The staff was terrible as well. They had no personality, and showed little interest to my dinning needs. DON'T GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the recipe cards were helpful for someone who hasn't been there before and isn't sure what to put in their bowl!"}
{"text":"Kendrick was very friendly. Talkative. However the service has  really declined.  The staff was more interested in their conversations than talking to customers. And the bartender was rude.  If you are gonna raise your prices provide good customer service."}
{"text":"Initial Impression and experience: So I have always loved Mongolian BBQ. I've dined at many in CA over the years, and this is the first one I've been to here in NV. When we walked up we were greeted outside the door and followed in to be seated right away. That was nice. We were sat at a table and told out waiter would be right with us. He came over and asked if we had ever been there. We said no, so he explained how it all works. Pretty easy to figure out, but whatever, we listened anyway. We got up and went to the food counter. All the food looked fresh and crisp. It was a little difficult to reach some of the items in the back because of the very low sneeze guard. The bowl they give you is VERY small, so everything you try to overstack falls off  :/ We watched them cook our food for a minute, and they came over to let us know our appetizer was on the table for us. So we went over to sit and eat.  Service: Service was on the a lot to be desired side. We each had a drink and they never refilled them for us. They actually took my boyfriends cup (like they were going to refill it) but never brought it back. They listened to my 13 year son over me on whether or not he was going to get all you can eat and brought him a second bowl to fill up anyway. I had to again tell them no, we are not getting all you can eat.  Food: The food was fresh and very good sauces and spices were available.  Price: TOO EXPENSIVE. There were 3 of us and we each got 1 bowl, an appetizer to share, and each a drink and we spent over $50. Too much to pay if you don't even end up with some left overs to take home. The price would have been fine if it was all you can eat that we did, but not for 1 tiny bowl.  Overall: We enjoyed the food a lot, but there wasn't enough and it was too expensive. I would go back, but not for the price. Like another person said, it's almost double what you would pay in CA for the same thing. You can even get close to this same type of food at any buffet here is Vegas and pay less, but have other options as well. I really liked the food and would love to go back, but only if they drop their prices."}
{"text":"I am brainwashed into thinking that airport being in an airport means \"eat bad Chinese food \".  I went on a search for Manchu Wok and was pleasantly surprised to find the Genghis Grill.   Made in Mongolian Style (huge flat wok), the dishes  have a good amount of meet and fresh vegetables.  I was glad to have some stir fried rather than deep fried Chinese food. I hope this chain spreads to more airports."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I could never make my dish good. Recently though, it finally came out well and I've been returning ever since! We were waiting for our movie to start and decided to get a few drinks. Customer service has always been good to me. We ended up just getting some drinks, saki, and pot stickers. You can't go wrong with their happy hour its really not that bad. I can definitely see myself coming back here!"}
{"text":"This food was AMAZIN!  I recommend the red curry sauce w cayenne pepper for a little kick *"}
{"text":"I wish they didn't close the one location we have in Illinois. I love this place for the variety. You are your own chef. You choose your own ingredients, so only you can really mess it up!"}
{"text":"The cook, aka, my son, told us he was on the grill and he said, \"you guy's can come by if you want, I'm getting pretty good at cooking.\"    Well, two things struck me, the fact he said we could come by and that he was getting better at cooking raw meat .  Seriously,  he's excellent at it and he did a great job with our food (5/5).  It's no longer endless trips to the food bar though.  There's 3 bowl sizes and you have a variety of raw meats, seafoods,  veggies, and sauces to pick from.  You place the meat and veggies as high as you can and place the sauces on the side.  If it's slow enough load veggies first and then the heavier raw meats or seafood.  My fav sauces are honey soy and mongo bbq (5/5).  Service is great (5/5) and ambiance is too albeit it is not Asian motif (5/5).  WatchIng them cook up the food with the wooden sticks is cool too.   It's a great experience!"}
{"text":"Good thing about this place is that you can get fresh veggies, freshly cooked. The taste is just too sweet for my taste. So no point of having fresh veggies sugar loaded.  The price is a little high too compared to serving size and taste."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to this place... I was there with my hubby on Friday night and noticed raw ship mixed in with the cold imitation crab.  Typically the imitation crab can be eaten cold.  My concern is that raw seafood cannot ever sit in a bowl of food that people are going to eat raw.  There is cross cantamition with this situation.  I pointed it out to the staff and a staff member pulled out the raw shrimp but left the crab for others to eat. I explained the situation to the Manager as I'm sure there is no harm intended but you have to educate your workers about cross contimation - I stick with tofu at this place.  Not one of my faves anymore - and the language coming from the cooks can make a Sailor blush - loud F bombs and I just chose not to hear that during a dinner that is meant to be relaxing."}
{"text":"Good. Fast. fresh. Borderline pricey. Inconsistent customer service. You can eat - paleo, primal, veg, or fatty."}
{"text":"After hearing friends rave about how great this place is we gave it a try fo lunch last Sunday. What a mistake.  I guess I'm spoiled, backin Chicago we had a great Mongolian BBQ place where the food was excellent as was the service. The service we received here was good, but the quality of the food isn't. I made my own bowl qhile my partner ordered the Korean tacos. He couldn't tell me enough how much he disliked it and he is very easy going and forgiving when it comes to restaurants.  My bowl was devoid of flavor due to the minimal amount of sauce they give you. Keep in mind I gave them an idea of what I wanted and they assisted me since it was my first (and last) visit.   This is just another average chain restaurant with below average food."}
{"text":"This is the only Mongolian bbq place I know of and in the past it was very good. We put little seasoning and sauce but still very salty. I don't know if I'll be back. There's nothing like the ones in California!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location several times.  The food is delicious!  Well worth the price.  The daytime staff is great, but the evening staff is incompetent and lousy!!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their fun Mongolian establishment! It's self-serve and build your own meal, but they've got all the cool stuff, and an extensive selection of ingredients to choose from! So much you'd be so undecided on what to choose. Was in town visiting family and ended up coming TWICE! Here is my take and how why both visits are worthy of a rare 5 star:  1.) THE MEAT: This is one of the best parts. From what I recall, they have Chicken, Spicy Chicken, Fish, Steak, Beef, Bacon, Pepperoni, Crab, Eggs, and a few other things that I forget. Everything looked very fresh!   2.) TASTE TEST YOUR FLAVORS! You can taste as many sauces as you'd like, and you can mix them. If you're not sure try them! This is not your typical Mongolian, they have sauces like Kung Pao and Teriyaki which is all you really need if you want that type of a dish.  3.) INDECISIVE? DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START? No worries. In the beginning of the line, they have fun recipe cards you can use and to help you start so then if you're looking to put in your flavor...you can play around with it. Think of it as an inspiration card.  4.) CHOOSE YOUR STARCH: I usually go with the brown rice. I love that that they have brown rice and I'm sure you healthy eaters will too. Think it's not enough? You can get it on cabbage as well to be extra lean!  5.) SUPER COOL TOUCH PAD: Here, you can split your tab with your lunch date and fun touch pad games while waiting. You can order drinks which we did one night during dinner; it was delivered FAST!  **I love that this brings an opportunity to just get creative. You can be really interactive with it. The place has a great ambiance to hang out and have fun! We will be back anytime we are in AZ."}
{"text":"I came into the restaurant two days ago, a Friday night. The line was long so we thought we would get an appetizer. The waitress said the potstickers we were looking at were amazing. We ordered the potstickers and they looked nothing like the menu! They came out white, they looked boiled and not fried at all. It was disappointing to come back to the table to 5 potstickers that were horrible looking and cost $7! At least my noodle bowl came out good.  I suggest passing on the appetizers and people just ordering the noodle bowls"}
{"text":"This location used to be one of our favorite places to eat in the area. However the last two times err have been in the smell was so bad that we had to leave. Today it smelled just like wet dog, and the floor was so sticky it was worse than the worst movie theater I have ever been in. This place has some cleaning issues they need to address in the front of house."}
{"text":"How is it that a place as amazing as Genghis Grill is going to allow a dirty 20 something kid cook for them. As i watched him cooking my food he takes his ball cap off and runs his handa through his hair right over my food. Ive never been so disgusted. The manager and his half ass attempt to fix it asks me what i wanted him to do. My honest answer was \"send him home, hes just contaminated the entire cooking area by being a filthy man.\"Manager kinda tucked tail and allowed this filthy cook to yell at him. I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone. You want good Genghis Grill then do yourself a huge favor and go to the one at Tempe Market Place."}
{"text":"We've now been to this restaurant 4 times and it just stays fairly bad. We've talked to management and get excuses and statements like, \"oh, we're just really busy\", \"we're still training\", etc. The quality of the ingredients is really good and the service is pretty good, too. Where this place falls down is the cooking. They just can't seem to get the concept that the bowls need to be placed on the grill in the order they arrive and come off in that order, too. Three of the four times we've been I've had burnt food because the cooks are standing around talking or horsing around lighting the grill. If you've ever been to a real Mongolian BBQ I think you will be disappointed in this place. We're hoping somebody recognizes the potential and opens up a good one!"}
{"text":"Really good, fast, and can be super healthy' or not.  Its a build it yourself place, so if you don't know what to make for yourself, ask.   Expected a fast food style place, definitely not, in a good way."}
{"text":"Genghis Grill has figured out a way for their servers to do absolutely nothing. Already there was no real \"kitchen\" for them to maneuver, and now they don't even serve water...you get it yourself. They were also out of straws on the day I recently went. Really? You're completely out of STRAWS? Not even for the fishbowl drinks you have? That's a mark of poor management not keeping simple necessities like straws in order.   I was sort of in a love affair with Genghis Grill when I first moved here, but really, it is not that good. They have cut so many corners since then that it's not even fun to eat here. I want full baby corns, dammit, not cut up that I can barely taste it or get it on my fork.   I would rather have Panda Express or Pei Wei than this crapola. Pass."}
{"text":"Met some friends here today and this was my first visit. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I like that we had a server who explained the process. She brought three different sized bowls (small, medium and large). We also got cards with our names and size of our bowls on each card. I picked a large because it didn't seem that big at first...  Went to the bar which had lots of meat choices including steak, chicken and fish. Meat was the  first stop too, so we could pile it on! Yum! Added some spices (maybe a little too many), veggies and sauce. It was so fun!!! Handed it off to the cooking station and our server brought out the cooked portion. After adding the rice (my startch choice), the bowl became huge! Lol I had to use two to-go containers to take home my leftovers!"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible food! I had the special fried rice and it was flavorless and the chicken tasted stale. I don't expect anything amazing at an airport but this was sub par by any scale."}
{"text":"We were greeted as we entered, and sat immediately.  The waitress was nice enough to explain to my fiancee how this restaurant works - 1.) order off of the menu, 2.) pick what you want in your bowl of a listed menu and have them make it for you, or 3.) head on up to the buffet bar and pick all your own items to go into your bowl.  We decided to head up to the bar so we could be hands on with our experience. The food looked fresh and it was hard to decide between all the options! Once all your decisions are made (protein, veggie, sauce, etc.) you can take your bowl over to the very large, round grill for the staff to cook it up and brought to your table.  Overall: A If we are over in that area, I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before, most recently 4 months ago. We really liked it as a standard Mongolian BBQ. However, I went last night and was disappointed. They've switched to small, med, and large bowl options which is an OK idea, but the small is $8.99 and TINY. All of the handles for scoop ingredients were filthy and sticky up to the tips of the handles. They added tasting spoons for sauces (again good idea), but the flavors of the sauces were lacking and homogeneous, with many being honey-something or other. Someone mentioned new owners, which may explain the changes.  The only high point was our waitress, Victoria I believe, who was amazing! However, her awesome serving skills weren't enough for me to plan to come back."}
{"text":"As far as airport food goes, this was not a bad option. It's certainly not a normal Mongolian BBQ place because that's just not feasible in an airport. But they had great menu options and the cashier even made it a point to ask every single customer if they had any food allergies. For the gluten-free crowd, they have several soy-sauce substitutes available, so you don't have to limit yourself to just the curry options.  If this had not been in an airport, I might not have been so generous with my rating. However, it was an excellent airport option."}
{"text":"Glad to see a decent Mongolian grill choice in south Charlotte.  Food was good (although highly dependent on your skill at mixing and matching ingredients - they do try to help by giving some recipe cards to follow).  Service was good.  All in all a decent option for a fun and reasonable meal in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"So why would you beat up on a brand new place. obviously these are younger folks just trying to make money by starting here and you folks just throw them under the bus. This is not rocket science  but they do have some highly edumacated folks there. Yes they are a chain but yes this is new store. The concept is sound, the food is fresh and clean and only bad because you cant figure out how to season it. That is the whole concept. I sit at full service bar and am treated like king with my named asked for and used several times. Drink and food club stuff avail. All you can eat for 14.00 is cheap. If you dont know how to fill one bowl to the max and dont understand how meat shrinks when you cook it then pay the extra 3 bucks cheapass. I have been waiting for good Mongo since that place went TU on Flamingo near UNLV.  Give these guys a chance, ask questions the first time you are there, they will gladly help you out. Most of all give immediate common sence feedback on table size and such so they can at least look into improveing your crummy little life experience. Dont just go once, like it but whine about it!"}
{"text":"This place was great at one time, all you could eat for a fair price, then it went to pay extra for all you can eat, and then to three bowl sizes. The large bowl that you pick your items in used to be much bigger than the next size bowl. Was in today and the large bowl was the same size as the regular bowl, when I asked about this was told bowl was the large. In the past my meats would feel one box and the rice in a separate box but tonight it all fit in one box with lots of room. Genghis is getting so cheep, I don't think I will be back...."}
{"text":"I was very impressed. This is the best Mongolian grill I have been to so far.  A lot of people seem to be complaining about the fans and the way you have to put together your own recipe....and I don't get that. We live in Phoenix, the fans were quite welcome; and there are racks of recipe \"cheat sheets\" if you aren't creative or your culinary aptitude is nil.  That being said, I was thoroughly impressed with the selection of all ingredients--particularly the array of spices and sauces to choose from. The \"3G sauce\" as it was called if I remember correctly, is recommended highly.   Like others have said, a bottomless bowl is definitely not necessary, one bowl was more than enough. Also, they have bottled domestic beers for only $1 all day every day last time I was in, so get down on that, why not. Two beers cost me less than my friend's coke.  This place deserves a higher rating, give it a try."}
{"text":"Food was really good with fresh ingredients. price is a little high so make sure you fill your bowl completely to get what you pay for. it was our first time and a little confusing so try to go with someone who has been before."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile. While it is a pick and choose kind of set up it has been much improved since I was last here. Being able to pay at your table is a nice convenience.  Also ordering drinks, appetizers,  etc is great. Enjoyed the meal and pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"I consider this a lunch spot, I don't think I would come here for dinner.  I also wouldn't ever pay full price to eat at Genghis Grill.  If you plan on eating here, I suggest signing up for their club to get your free regular size birthday bowl and other coupons via email, plus every 10th bowl free.  This restaurant falls somewhere between fast food and full service.  You are seated by a hostess, but a while back they changed it so you get your own beverages (Coke Freestyle machines), and you go down a buffet style line to pick your bowl ingredients, but you order appetizers and bar drinks from a server.  I really had to get over my fear of going down a buffet line of raw proteins (chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc.).  It scared me because of possible cross contamination, salmonella, temperature, etc.  After coming here on multiple occasions and not getting sick, my anxiety has lessened a bit, but I remain very careful.    Some tips: Make sure you season your meat or your bowl will be bland.  Pile your veggies high because they will cook down.  You can add egg to your bowl when you order your starch.  You can also pick up some toppings (peanuts, sesame seeds, chow mein noodles, and chili paste) while there."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day, and I have to say it was pretty good. My only other experience with Mongollean style stir fry has been YC's. And I used to find that with YC's no matter what \"sauces\" you used in preparing your meal, it always tasted the same.   At Genghis, I fixed up my meal following the direction for Thai Chicken, and it came out tasting like Thai Chicken... with a nice little kick.   The lunch portions are good. And the server actually walks you through the whole process if it's your first trip.  HUGE selection of different ingredients and topping and sauces. You can follow on of the many \"recipes\" or create your own.   I will be back to give this place another go!"}
{"text":"Awful! Rude waiters, dirty dishes, served lettuce wraps with holy butter lettuce with hot meat on them?! 2 regrets, that I didn't check Yelp reviews first & honestly, I would have been happier with Arby's next door!!"}
{"text":"Genghis Grill is a great idea I wish we had one in NY!  I love the idea of making your own bowl and making it whatever you want it to be from the different meats, vegetables, spice, sauces, and starch you want.  For people who have trouble making choices they have cards you can follow to help you.  The food was very fresh and they cooked well.  I would recommend this place to anyone who loves any kind of stir fry. The combinations are endless!  Price is very good too!  The place was very clean and I like the building.  One thing I wasn't sure of was if they have wifi."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Awesome variety of meats & veges makes for a great way to customize your bowl with all your faves. My new favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the epitome of Americanized Asian food. Ham? Pepperoni? Maybe for the confused. And the sauces - the god awful sauces I could probably buy in an overpriced bottle in the \"Asian\" section of Safeway. They were loaded with too much sugar. I tried the \"Mongolian BBQ sauce\" which was really actually cleverly disguised Texan BBQ sauce - lots of cumin in it and pretty much devoid of Asian flavors like hoisin and sesame oils. I also tried the Dragon sauce and teriyaki. Both loaded with sugar.   On top, the bowl they give you for your toppings seems pretty tiny. I couldn't pack the meat plus the vegetables I wanted. The actual bowl that is served is huge because they load it with noodles. The ratio should have more vegetables like cabbage and bean sprouts and lower on the noodles.   Oh, you can also get your BBQ wrapped in a burrito too. OK.  At least service was good? Pretty much it's only saving factor. I'm pretty sure Panda Express has less sugar, and at least their food doesn't consist of pepperoni (Truth: I love Panda Express). The fact that this people think this is Asian food makes me die inside a little."}
{"text":"I've been to Genghis twice and the first time was very lack luster.. I was going to give a 2 or 3 star review but after my second encounter I decided to up the ante to a 4 star. The food is traditional Mongolian BBQ in that you get a small bowl which you skillfull try to stuff as much ingredients into then have them cook it for you either over noodles or rice. Sauce included or on the side. The sides are good I love that they have bok choy  which you dont often see on many Mongolian BBQ's. They try hard to keep the area clean and usually succeed. The only complaint I have is that maybe the people cooking need a lil more training.. sometime the food sits a lil too long on the grill .. just my preference I suppose..  Its decent.. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time eating here the people is very friendly and helpful .. Very clean so are the restrooms .. You pick how you want your food .. Very good selection to choose from .. And the dessert omg beautiful ! I will come back two thumbs up"}
{"text":"So we have been going to Genghis for the last 7 years, It has made some changes through the years..the most recent is their is no ALL YOU CAN EAT BOWL, Let me tell you the males in my family miss that. They have Small, Med and Large bowls now. The large is big, bigger than your eyes think, so big I even had leftovers to take home. The concept is that of a Mongolian barbecue in which you place the Proteins, which there are about 8 of, in the bowl, add dry spices, veggies, wet sauces and then bring it to the huge flat grill where the cooks will stir fry it with your choice of a carb ( rice, noodles, cabbage, or tortillas). It would be so nice if you could have all the ingredients they carry in your fridge at all times, but since they don't this is wonderful. They have cut back on some of the fillings but its still such a great flavor profile that you end up craving it! Fill your bowl and ask for a raw egg to be added to it when you get to the grill, believe me it is so good!!"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????SML??????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"We end up here about once a month. The food is good and I like the idea of choosing my own ingredients and flavors. I am bothered, though, that the service is consistently blah. I don't know what is happening with staff, but something is bringing them down."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I am a huge fan of Mongolian barbecues and this place is no exception. The server was ultra friendly, the ingredients looked pretty fresh, and there are instructions for you non-veterans to Mongolian bbq. So after overfilling my bowl with an assortment of goods, I sat down and 5 minutes later the raw food became hot and delicious stir-fry. I'm definitely coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"So cool! Reminds me of place in Cleveland called Mongolian BBQ!  Bestie took me here after a long delicious night.  Never been here before so good and Yumma and fun!! And it is my friends birthday but we did not sign up in time for a free birthday bowl which we noticed was an option on the iPad menu on our table but our server Mia was AMAZING"}
{"text":"Turned on to this place by a friend. When I walked in, immediately reminded me of Pei Wei. Seems like the same kind of concept, but you build your meal yourself.  If you don't come with someone who has experienced this place before, you could wind up skimping yourself on your meal. You are responsible for either building your dream bowl, or you can select from a few recommended templates. But, if you don't take into consideration that your meal will shrink drastically once it is fully cooked, your overstuffed precooked bowl comes to your table cooked and barely half the size it was before. I've even stacked to the point of carrying my bowl to the cooking station covering the edges with my hands to keep it all in and still got back a very small cooked portion.  All in all, the food tastes great, better yet, awesome, you just don't get a lot of bang for your buck and it's a pretty steep buck. But I give them brownie points for serving Coke Zero!"}
{"text":"So I come here very often and it has gotten better every time. Not sure if that's my skill level at stacking my bowl or the flavors they offer in the selections. I have so much good to say about this place from the staff to the food to the atmosphere always showing espn on every screen big plus for me. I would say that I love how u just have to ask for shrimp and they add at the grill only minus is they are some ver small shrimp. Also I'm not a fan of being sat right by the entrance door when there are seats available all through out. But that doesn't outweigh the deliciousness of the meal. Being able to put as much as u can in a bowl recreating the leaning tower of pizza is the goal and they encourage it. Your pretty much the chef and what u choose to be in your food is what your going to eat so don't be bashful. Overall an amazing experience for adults and children alike!! I'll always come"}
{"text":"Great fun and great food. Added egg. Yesss they still do that. Chicken potstickers are the bomb. Love this place....MJ"}
{"text":"I love this place. Meats and spices and veggies, all cooked how I like them. I often do gluten free, and often feel picky and stingy when asking servers to alter stuff and its nice having it my way from the get go."}
{"text":"Went here while waiting for my friend to get off work on a weekday which is cool because they have lunch menu and a dinner menu.   I ordered three large bowl and loaded it up. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars because I feel like they can have more options of vegetables to put in your bowl. Other than that great service great beverage station and food was very good and came out fast !"}
{"text":"Basically you serve yourself by putting different meats, veggies, spices, and other ingredients in a bowl and then they cook it for you on a giant grill. I took my vegan brother and his wife there since they could just mix vegetables. Decently priced and you can never make the same thing twice. The food kind of tastes like Mongolian bbq."}
{"text":"I have been here about four times and I would like to finally write a great review! Genghis Grill is a very inviting place with a laid back atmosphere. The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly. The quality of the food is very good and the final product is delicious. They have cards that will help you achieve the flavor you are looking for and they have a wide variety of vegetables, meats, and seasonings. I will be back because it is the closest thing to \"Hu Hot Mongolian Grill\" that is located in the midwest."}
{"text":"Yes. Just, yes.   Basically you choose whether you want a Small, Medium, or Large bowl. Take that bowl through a self serve buffet station filled with; various protein options, spices, produce & sauces. Once you make it to the end, someone will be waiting to cook your food along with your choice of rice, or noodles. When your food is cooked, your server will deliver it to your table. Eat & enjoy.  Genghis grill is fantastic! You can't really complain about the food, because you literally build your own stir-fry. The selection in the little buffet thingy is great!   The only complaint is that their drinks are too expensive. We arrived during happy hour & I ordered the $4 Bloody Mary that was on special, & it was disappointingly small. My boyfriend drank Bud Light, which was still $4.50 per 12 oz. glass."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were out running errands around town this past weekend and passed by this place.  I mentioned wanting to try it sometime and that I had been to a place with the same concept many years ago in Tempe and thought it was really cool.  After we were done running errands we were headed back the same direction and came up to Ghenghis and he pulled in the parking lot and suggested we go ahead and try it.  We walk in and wait to be seated like the sign says, right off the bat I notice several employees walk by without even acknowledging us.  Then this male employee walks over with a bewildered look on his face, like he clearly is not used to seating people.  I thought he'd figure it out since it's not exactly a large restaurant.  We should have just grabbed a seat at their bar!  He told us someone would be right with us and a girl came over and sat us...right next to the server station.  Whatever I was starving and didn't really care at that time.  Neither one of us had been there so our waitress who sat us rapidly explained the process, she went thru it so fast I just decided we should fill out their form and have them make our bowls for us.  When she got back to us for our order we ordered drinks, I got a coke and he ordered a beer.  We proceeded to sit there for about 20 minutes, meanwhile at the table next to us some people sat down after us and were brought their meals and were almost done!  Our waitress comes over and says our food should be out any minute, not long after that another woman comes over ( I assume the manager since she wasn't wearing a server uniform) and says that they are out of two of the seafood items that my fiance had ordered.  He changed his order and we continued to wait all the while thinking why the hell didn't they tell us that in the first place!  Then as we waited and waited some more I started wondering why our waitress said our food should be out soon when they clearly hadn't even started cooking it yet if they didn't even possess the food to cook it.  By this point I was extremely hungry and irritated, I had half a coke left his beer was empty and the waitress comes by and drops off a fresh coke that I felt like she did only to try and make up for our wait.  But maybe she should have thought of asking if my fiance wanted another beer since his was empty!  She did stop to ask if they had told us they were out of his order and said she would take our bowls off, whatever that meant.  We continued to wait a few more minutes until I just couldn't wait any longer.  We got up to leave and walked passed the manager lady sitting at a bar table who said thanks for coming...ya thanks for NOTHING!  They weren't even what I would call busy.  I have never had to walk out on service like that.  I was looking forward to a cool new experience and ended up being extremely disappointed.  I will never go there again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Genghis Grill many times and always loved the food. This last visit was exceptionally great. Our appetizer took a bit longer than it should have and our waiter, John, didn't miss a beat to take it off our bill and apologize (we hadn't even noticed it took awhile and insisted it was fine), we enjoyed the delicious appetizer on the house, our custom lunch bowls, and then we ordered the hazelnut pretzel wontons for desert. The kitchen was short on prepared wontons for the dish so John comped the desert from our bill as well. I work at a restaurant and know many things can go wrong unexpectedly. John was amazing at keeping us updated and happy during our visit! We definitely plan on becoming regulars of his!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and chill for a little. Seevice was fast and a very friendly staff plus great food.  Area clean and music wasn't over bearing and facility was very clean.  I will be xoming back"}
{"text":"Appetizers never got made, brought wrong bowls to the table, they didn't explain how things worked... Very disappointing for a first visit, will not be back!"}
{"text":"First time here & my best friend & I loved it. We were a little scared at first because we didn't know how much to add of the meats, veggies, & seasoning, but our amazing server Andie walked us through the process! Will definitely return here again!"}
{"text":"My low review it's about the service I received today (06/16) and about our waiter Hayley, my food was great and I don't have any complaints about food value or flavor.  I met my family for dinner at Genghis, I have a young niece that had pizza and a kids drink from some other place for dinner; sometimes we get her Mac & Cheese but today she wanted pizza. We ordered our plates and drinks and by the time the bowl came to the table I basically had to \"guess\" if my bowl was my bowl because the waiter said the cooks had lost the name tag/receipt/little piece of paper with my name (no biggie it was my plate anyhow) I just found it inconvenient, what if it wasn't? That was problem #1  Problem #2 (and most important) We ate, we ordered separate checks and when mine comes it had a \"Kids drink on it\" I found it odd, but I was sure If I told my waiter she could take care of it. When she came and took the cards to process payment I said \"I believe you charged me for the kids drink but we brought that for her (my niece) from the pizza place\" the she says \"But you were putting soda on the cup RIGHT?!?(with a very accusatory tone)  so I replied \"Yes?!?! (very confused)\" This because YES I did put soda on my niece's cup very small cup maybe HALF cup because she finished her soda and my boyfriend SHARED his soda with her on her cup. So this mean she either was spying on us or somehow knew that I shared half cup of soda with my niece which I find very interesting and lame to be honest, to be watching what your customers do or don't. Actually I was also sharing my bowl with my boyfriend, am I going to be double charged because we shared the bowl??  Hayley (and I'm assuming this was her name because it was on the receipt) then explained to me that since it's free refills it's charged by each person so that's why I was charged since I was putting soda on another cup. She asked if it was ok to which I replied \"Yeah that's fine\" and proceed to pay $1.50 for sharing my drink with a kid. I mean, she already assumed and made me feel like I was stealing soda by sharing 1/2 cup so what could I do other than pay, RIGHT?!??!  Very disappointing experience since we are paying $40+ dlls to eat there I think $1.50 could've been spared, we even left a full refilled cup of soda that wasn't needed or consumed that I'm sure it went to waste. It's not that I was stealing the forks or any valuables, I mean you guys would've known since you were very attentive to what I was doing.   Anyways, problem #3, the floor is very sticky."}
{"text":"It's difficult to rank a place like Genghis Grill for it's food, since you are the one choosing the ingredients, deciding how much sauce is in the bowl, etc. So it may be that I made some poor choices to result in the just-okay meal I had.   Once seated, you take a little slip of paper that you bring to the BYOB (build your own bowl) counter, which dictates how much stuff you can put in your bowl. The person manning the station was super helpful, giving us tips on what the sauces were like. I also loved that you get fined if you move backwards down the line. They didn't say why, but i saw that the bar went from chicken to beef to fish to veggies (Yay food safety!)   Because of how I built my bowl, there wasn't too much sauce, which I was a bit sad about. The flavors were good (get the spicy beef!), though the \"udon\" noodles weren't quite right-I was so excited because I love udon, but this wasn't real udon. That was the most disappointing part :("}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my cousin when I was visiting him on his end of town. So me and my wife went to try it out. We were greeted as soon as we came through the door. They explained how it works because it was our first time there. You get 2 metal bowls the small one is for your sauce. They have cards to tell you how to fix some bowls that are very easy to follow. Now it's time to load your bowl up. The first station you get to is the meat section, they had chicken, beef, pork, fish, scallops, calamari, etc... The next section is the season section. They have little spoons so you can sample the seasons and the sauces. The next section is the fruit section, the next section is the vegetable section. They have a wide variety of veggies: broccoli, string beans, tomatoes, onions, green onions, carrots, mushrooms, bean sprouts, spinach, etc....The next station is the sauces also a wide variety. Then your last stop is the grill where you tell the cook what starch you want, steamed rice, fried rice, brown rice, udon noodles, spiral pasta or tortillas. He gives you a card and you take it with you and place it in the holder they have on the table where you were seated. Then they stir fry it. The thing I love the most is your food comes straight to you hot off the grill. That stir fry was so good. The watermelon/lemonade was good too."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the different sauces. I wasn't impressed with how the meat is served (turned into something like hamburger on the grill). I also expected an all you can eat experience, trying different combos along the way, but at an extra $5 that makes dinner 14.99 before drinks, not what I expected from a place like this."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went there on a Saturday night. They said the were down 2 chefs. It took 20 mins to get thru the food line then 35 mins for our food to come out. The food was hot so that's why I gave a 1 star. I'll never visit this place again. I'd rather go to YCs"}
{"text":"Ghengis is amazing! Used to come here all the time for lunch but then I switched jobs so this was the first time back in a while. One thing I noticed is that bowls seem to have gotten a little more expensive, $13 for a small bowl&  almost $15 for a big bowl. Crazy. But the concept is still great, love putting together your own bowl."}
{"text":"This was suppose to be my first time eating at this establishment! I have heard great things about this place, so of course I wanted to try it. Well this was a short stop. My boyfriend & I came in and were kindly greeted by the host and sat us down. :) Perfect. Welp, as a first-timer I didn't know what to do,. 10 minutes went by & we weren't acknowledged by a single waiter/waitress. A whole 10 minutes on what was a slow evening. 2 couples came in after us and were treated RIGHT away! Me and my boyfriend ended up getting fed up on how horrible service we were provided with! Not a good 1st impression!"}
{"text":"I'll make this short and to the point.  YC's is good for a Mongolian grill but Genghis is much better.  The quality of meat alone is a reason to choose Genghis over YC's.  BTW they serve alcohol as well!  -d"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I  want overly impressed but my parents were wanting something a bit different. So we have Genghis a shot. I have to admit they have made improvements. Mongolian BBQs are becoming difficult to find so this is a fun experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this place in Phoenix and I was super psyched when one opened in Las Vegas! I'm glad it's here but it's not my favorite. I eat here about twice a month anyway because it's an easy way to get your veggies and it's cheap.  You go in, sit down, order your drink and get a bowl. Then you belly up to the bar and fix your own bowl. Drop it at the grill and your server delivers it to your table when it is ready.   THE BAD:  The bar is usually dirty which freaks me out. I know it's hard to keep the place clean but geez, sometimes it is downright nasty. The cooks also NEVER cook my bowls enough. I ask for it super well done / almost blackened and every single time my shrimp comes out opaque and I have to tell 'em to cook it more. I also experience tummy issues an hour or so after eating here...maybe from all the fiber? I don't know.   Another thing I really hate is that EVERY SINGLE TIME I have eaten here, the server has felt the need to comment on how many bowls I've eaten. We've had probably 8 different waiters and they all say something about it. I'm not fat (and there's nothing wrong with being chunky) but I can eat, and it makes me really uncomfortable when people feel like they have to say things like \"wow, this is your THIRD BOWL?\" Maybe corporate teaches them to do that so they will shame you into not getting another plate of shrimp. (And by the way, my bowls are usually 100% veggies; I don't like that meat that swims in its own...juices on the bar)!   THE GOOD:  You can pile on all the meat and veggies you want. It's fun to play chef and create a bowl with all the different dry spices and wet sauces. I usually pay the additional $3 to add on the all-you-can-eat bowl because it makes it easier to experiment. If you don't like the first bowl, make another.   The iced tea is freshly brewed and really good, and they have Coke Zero. I also love that there are lots of protein choices (marinated steak, chicken breast, shrimp, turkey, and more) and you can choose a starch (tortillas, noodles, rice) or just have none at all (I usually have no starch).   It's an easy place to get full for under $30 for two. I've noticed the crowds have died down significantly since the place opened. It used to be packed and you had to wait to eat but now you can walk in pretty much any time of the day. A decent place to go and one that I'll continue to visit."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place because they don't start off with frozen meats like YC's does...unfortunately I've had better experience with YC's. I didn't really like the fact that I handed off my food and sat down because I'm pretty sure they poured another sauces on mine! I went with everything sweet and ended up with such a spicy meal that I had to stop eating it!! Big problem! It was nice that they give discounts to ASU students though. Not sure I want to go back and be disappointed...but we shall see, I am quite the forgiving person! Everyone makes mistakes! Just wish it weren't ALWAYS with my meals!"}
{"text":"Great food! I've been to many Mongolian grills, including YC's, and this place is the bee's knees! Very user-friendly, great drinks, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Nothing all that spectacular in my opinion. Marinated beef was chewy and I ended up picking out most of it. Sauces tasted a little bland after cooking. Dinner bowl is $9.99 which is a little pricey considering the choices and portions. I'd rather pay a little more and go to Kabuto Japanese Steak house where the food is cooked in front of you with some added entertainment provided by the cook. Good thing I had a coupon so I was able to shave a little off the total. I think one visit is good enough for me."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. They just need to have more locations. I live in N. Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Officially a fan. I wasn't able to review the place fully because I hadn't tried the food yet, but last night I made a delish mix at Genghis.  Marinated steak chased by a few seasonings, and that yummy teriyaki, dragon, and asian sauces with Udon noodles...I think I'm drooling writing about this right now. It was seriously soo good and fresh nothing frozen.   My buddy and I sat at the bar watched the game, enjoyed great food with good convo and sipped out countless mimosa's. Definitely a great way to spend a Sunday."}
{"text":"The short of it: I'm not sure I would pay regular price here too often, but I always enjoy my free birthday bowl immensely. And it's gotten better the more I've learned to add enough salt and spices.  This is the only Genghis Grill which I've been to, and other than that, I haven't really had too much so-called Mongolian barbecue aside from mall food courts. The premise is that you can pick your own meats, starch, and flavors and have them cook it on a giant hot metal flattop.  The routine starts as follows: you're seated, a server asks you if you want appetizers or alcohol / bar seating (both of which I've never bothered with), and then you go to the line to choose your food. If you're lucky, there won't be much of a line and you'll get more time to weigh your options. If not, then think on your feet. As others have said, it's your own damn fault if you don't get a flavorful dish.  An employee will ask you if you want a small, medium, or large bowl. I thought I could have eaten a little more after the medium. You get to pick from a variety of proteins, spices and seasonings, and sauces. Definitely load your main bowl at least to the rim with proteins. I would stick to the ones that have recognizable meat texture, which for me were the marinated steak tips, pork, and marinated white fish. The chicken looked unappetizing and there was no way I was using the processed meats. Further down the line are various vegetables that you might also consider adding. I wouldn't add too many aside from mushrooms, onions, and maybe carrots since I'm all about meat.  The next two steps are so important that they get their own paragraph. You need to add spices and seasonings because there won't be enough from the meats, starches, or even the sauces. Use the tiny spoons to get several heaping spoonfuls of different granulated flavorings (such as garlic, ginger, cayenne, and yellow curry). Finally, you'll arrive at the sauces. Use a sampling spoon and try a sauce. If it's not that tasty, get another spoon and sample another sauce. Pick one or two that you like and ladle it into the small sauce bowl. I enjoy the 3G sauce, but you might not.  Finally, walk to the counter near the grill and present your bowl. They'll ask which starch you want. I picked udon noodle, but maybe you'll want rice or something. You can ask for 1 or more eggs to be added to your bowl here. They used to have eggs for you to grab in line, but I'm guessing too many of them dropped and broke. I believe you may be able to ask for a premade combination at the grill counter, but I wouldn't bother with that unless you're very lazy.  Grab a drink and maybe some condiments from the back area after you drop off your bowl to be cooked. They have those fancy Coca Cola machines that dispense seemingly hundreds of flavors from one spout. There's soy sauce, sriracha, and other things. Go back to your seat and wait an employee to present you with your bowl of cooked food. Eat and enjoy.  I will make this point again so that it's very clear. If you didn't add enough spices and whatnot, don't expect too many good things out of the bowl. You can probably still salvage it with the other condiments and some salt and pepper, and then you can berate yourself. It probably took me at least a couple of visits until I learned this lesson, and I'm so glad I did.  If you want a nice hot bowl of some Asian-inspired flavors with plenty of meat and some carbs, this is a good option. You know what flavors you're getting because you're designing the recipe, and that sure bet is probably worth $12 or so on a regular basis for some people."}
{"text":"This place has an interesting concept but, from entering the restaurant to being seated to prepping food and waiting for it to be cooked seems like a lot of wasted time and money. First they should have you start at the line to order food then seat yourself after food order is in. Also based on my experience and working F&B operations for over a decade in fine dining you should not allow guest mess with raw food in this way based on cross contamination. They should have a couple of people based on a chipotle ordering line to put your food together. This would eliminate any type of cross contamination. Also this would look more professional as well put my mind at ease for health and safety purposes. They could then hand off food for chef to cook. Eliminate the person from seating guest because this made no sense. This company is obviously not local and they thought sense they are opening a location in Las Vegas makes so much sense to put in a bar. Well surprise a bar makes no sense in a place like this. You can offer beer and wine(sake) and probably make the same if not do better since you are devoted to having the ridiculous bar area. This place needs an overhaul and you need people in there who actually know the business of restaurants rather than some high schoolers who think they know how to run Food and Beverage. They will never be successful if this place isn't executed correctly. Also prices need to be adjusted meaning reduce by a dollar in everything including 2.79 for a soda give me a break you took the Chipotle model and are charging at a premium something that isn't even near the quality of chipotle. If you are going to rip off an idea than it needs to executed correctly. Do not think you can change the genre of food and do it the same way and think you can be more successful. Good luck I would think about trying this place if they would consider making some of these changes."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying the the food is incredible and it's so cool to be able to season restaurant food to your liking. The options and ability to combine various meats are crazy cool. This is truly Mongolian barbecue. The only downside is ToGo takes forever because you must wait behind the guests dining in. So if there are 10-15 guests, expect an hour wait. It's impossible to call ahead because even if you know what you want, how do you convey portions? So long story short, if you're going to go- eat there and don't be pressed for time when you go. I recommend the Sriracha chicken and the Udon noodles."}
{"text":"Food was fine but the cost went up since the last time we have been here. That's fine too. What's not fine is throwing money back at my mother with a short aggressive \"you're short\" and walking away rather than waiting a half second for the $3 we were short.  We will definitely not be going back. Not if throwing someone's money in their face is acceptable."}
{"text":"No longer all you can eat for a prefix price bad health inspections in the past. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent value for the money. Fairly inexpensive, good quality food. $1 beers on Sunday is a plus."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Pick your bowl size (small, regular, large) and then pack it with steak, chicken, fish, tofu. Move on to the fresh veggies, add some spices, and finally choose your sauce. The chef whips it all together and your delicious bowl is ready in a few short minutes."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, and the service friendly. It's a bit pricey, though. I would return."}
{"text":"Really tasty, but expect to wait at least half an hour to get each bowl. I've been to a similar business out in Arizona and it was only 8$ for unlimited bowls instead of 15$....so it's a bit pricey for what it is. Dining room is also a claustrophobic little maze that's hard to navigate. The bowls that you get to select your ingredients are way tinier than they should be for 10$ and 3$ for a tiny bowl of edamame is laughable. Great potential, good flavor, but too high of price and too slow of service to be really excellent."}
{"text":"Took us late in the night and gave us great service ! Love the food ! Great place ! Been here many times!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! My server Jessica was very helpful, knowledgable and caring, the grill masters were on point with the cooking, and the place was clean... just a very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"So I had never been to a place like this, although I have seen them in other malls. Here, you are seated and then your server explains to you how it works (and very, VERY quickly, I might add... I know the concept is simple but I needed to know why the menu didn't exactly describe the food... and since I've written this review AFTER I've eaten here, I still don't know why the damn menu can't help out with explanations of some of the sauces and spices).   You are handed a small silver bowl (kinda like a doggy dish... huh.) You walk your lazy ass over to the line and load up on your choice of however much you want of raw chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, scallops, \"krab\" and whatever else is on this chilled salad bar. Playing upchuck-roulette isn't one of my favorite ways to spend an evening but hey, I'll try anything once.  From here you move on to a stack of different spices (which range from mild to ass-ripping) and while they are labeled, if you don't know what something is to begin with, then you just don't know. I picked three (one was garlic powder and the other two I couldn't tell you) and sprinkled my shrimp/chicken/beef. On to the vegetables! Here we have what amounts to a salad bar with a few Asian twists. I sometimes think of myself in the same way when I'm gettin' down, and that's only when my ego is in full force. But I digress. You load up veggies into your bowl, such as broccoli, spinach, baby corn, water chestnuts, mushrooms... and I threw in a few of those kung pao hot peppers, just for fun. Then you move down the line to the sauces! Here's where it gets stupid: There are about 20 different sauces. There are even tasting spoons if you don't know what something is. But my problem with this is that I'm not going to stand here and taste a bunch of stuff and hold up the line (although I am sure plenty of nimrods do). So I just closed my eyes and picked three, just like with the spices. Small scoops into a little dipping container and then you move down to the cook, who will fire up your food with noodles or rice and then have it brought directly to your table.  I can't tell you what I picked as far as sauces and seasonings go, but the food was cooked perfectly. Beef wasn't chewy and there was a nice sear on the sides of all of the meats. At first, I was disappointed because I couldnt taste any of my flavorings. But then a few minutes went by and I got that steamy, face-reddening, eye-watering aftertaste heat that only Asian food can produce. Great success! And I didn't get salmonella, either! (this time.) Oh... AAAND.... **$1 happy hour well drinks with a decent-to-heavy pour.**"}
{"text":"I travel every week. This is some of the worst I have eaten in an airport in the last 10 years. Had the Mongolia Bowl, their signature dish. The meat was enzymatically tenderized mush. They only gave you 2 oz of meat anyways. The rest was limp bell peppers and canned pineapple tid-bits. The sauce was sweet and cloying. The \"fried rice\" was instant rice mixed with soy sauce. If in CLT, keep moving."}
{"text":"Really, really good! We first walked in, and just stood there for a long time. Almost left, but they had just opened and we gave them time. Once we were seated, we met Mia. It was our first time there. We chose to make our own bowl. She walked us over, explained how it worked and let us loose on deciding what wonderful, fresh meat, veggies and sauces we wanted.   They have cards that offer suggestions on what to choose, or you can choose whatever sounds good. Get more veggies than you think...smashing it down in the bowl as you go along...as they cook down. I loved the idea of grabbing an egg so there would be scrambled egg in the mix, so don't forget to grab the egg along the way if that's what you like. Yum!  Really liked the experience. Mia checked back with us, as did the manager. Really loved the food! The service was great. We were really glad we didn't listen to the random bad reviews. This place is great."}
{"text":"My coworkers rave about this spot so I gave them a try. I am so happy I did! The food was delicious and the choices are endless! My only complaint was that I ordered my dish with noodles and they used rice as well. I don't know if they put rice in every bowl but it included some onions which I really hate. Outside of that, the servers are attentive and the foods fabulous!"}
{"text":"This location is now closed. Unfortunate. Really enjoyed. Closest is now at Tempe Marketpkace"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! When you go in there are 3 different bowl sizes and you can pile this bowl with a variety of different meats, vegetables, spices, and sauces.  It is very filling once it's stir-fryed and served to you. There should be another location opened because there is only one location so far."}
{"text":"I've reviewed the location at Arrowhead after a no so pleasant experience there. Was in the Paradise Valley area the thought I'd give this location a shot because I was really craving some stir fry. The food, just still ok. Not worth $9.99 per bowl. I do like the selection of protein and veggies. The service was just ok too. I checked in on Yelp to redeem 10% off, showed my server who still forgot to take it off my bill. He did fix it immediately. Also, when we first sat I reviewed the table menu briefly for a drink. While I did that he proceeded to tell me of about 3 or 4 items in the menu (appetizers, dessert, etc) that were no longer available.  Probably a good idea for management to get updated menus (JMO).  My issue is still the price though. I have to be really hungry and not willing to drive elsewhere to spend that kind of moola for just a single bowl of just okay mongolian."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here today.  It was only my second time.  The first time was okay so I thought I'd give it another try with my little boy.  Staff was friendly as was with my first visit.  Seated right away.  When we received our food we both immediately started enjoying.  Well after a few bites I noticed that a bite I was getting ready to put in my mouth had 1/2 bright blue rubberband in it.  I pulled it out and set it on the edge of my bowl then immediately noticed the next bite had a hair in it.  I initially thought it was maybe me just seeing things.  The manager walked over to see how I was doing.  I shared with him that I pulled the blue rubberband from bowl and found what appears to be hair still in my bowl.  He apolgized said the rubberband wasnt even something they use and the hair might just be bamboo sting.  At that point I didn't take his apology as sincere.  Well not like he could tell for sure I wasn't taking any chances so I stopped eating after that.  I hadnt barely made a dent in my bowl.  He stated he would \"take some off my bill\".  I would have honestly rather been offered a choice to go make a new bowl or discounted bill because I basically left hungry.  The \"discount\" on my bill before tax was almost $18 then a $2.80 discount then tax added back on total back up to about $18.  Like I said I didn't eat much of my bowl so I still paid the full price for it and had what amounted to the tax comped on my bill.    My waitress was really nice about but I know she had no say in what action the manager would take.  Feedback to Management: Next time better practice would be to offer customer to make new bowl (which would have been my choice), gift card for next visit, or just remove the whole tanted bowl from the bill.  A small discount is nothing considering I could have had a rubberband in my digestive system.  Highly likely I won't be back.  Other better stir fry joints I can give my business to."}
{"text":"We were excited to come to this Mongolian grill suggested by family.  First of all, we visited on a Friday night. This location is in the Tempe Marketplace, an outdoor mall. Parking was horrible, and that is not the fault of the restaurant.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, and the hostess quickly seated our group. Something had apparently spilled on the floor near the bar long before we arrived and we all walked through it. The service and customers had spread whatever was spilled in a sticky mess all throughout the restaurant. Gross.  To top that, the first table we sat at was also sticky, and before the waitress came back, we had found ourselves a new table.  There is quite a selection of meats and veggies, this was a plus. However, the selection of sauces, while extensive, is completely (almost?) sugar-based. It would be nice to have had some options that were lower calorie or lower glycemic index. Even just oil and soy sauce would have been nice.  The service came around often, however she never checked to see what everyone needed before darted off to get one person's drink., which resulted in her needing to make many more trips.  Overall the food was really just so-so, and the fresh meat that others describe was actually frozen when we made our bowls."}
{"text":"Genghis is the bomb! If you like YC's Mongolian, you will LOVE Genghis. They use fresh meat, not that packaged frozen crap. In itself it's such a different experience, and a fresh idea for a restaurant.  The bar is pretty fresh too, if you enjoy awesome happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Superb customer service here, 5 stars for sure. We came for dinner around 540 and there was plenty of seating. The hostess showed us our table and explained how things worked, and a gentleman came to take our drink orders. Think he was the manager, he checked up on us multiple times as well as everyone else in the place.  We took our cards with us and got in line. It got busy as everyone else seemed to join us at the same time. We chose our bowl size and got a tray and two small cups for our sauces. You move down the line and add protein, spices, veggies and other toppings. The guy in front of us was clearly a pro as he was stuffing his bowl and pushing down the contents like there was no tomorrow. But he took forever so that was annoying and I bypassed him. Love that they had several seafood options as well as tofu to suit my pescatarian diet. At the end, one of the cooks takes our card and asks if we'd like noodles and/or rice and how many eggs (2 for a regular bowl). I asked for both noodles and rice but only got noodles, so that was a small bummer but the noodles were good.   Overall I put way too much sauce and white fish but it was surely a filling meal. Next time I'll have to follow the guidelines for specific sauces cuz I was just adding everything that sounded good. It ended up being on the sweet side but the manager came through with some Sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and it always seems like something's changed when I go lol. I have a fail safe for a delicious bowl. They no longer have the sauce available that was my favorite. The small, med, large bowl option change is something I do not like because now I have to spend more to get what I was getting before. They do have a great happy hour and nice staff. I do enjoy this over YCs because the food is FRESH. Once it is cooked it makes a difference joy being cooked from a frozen state. Also they have more options for protein."}
{"text":"Decent food that is reasonably priced.  5 stars because this place is a good value for the cost.  I prefer for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 3 out of five because I loved the food,but the service was lacking. This was my first time eating here and I felt that my server did not properly explain everything. She did not mention the booklets they had with recipes you could make, did not tell us there were bowls in the menu that we could order, and did not really explain the process.   I did not like the fact that you have to scoop the meat yourself because its disgusting. Touching a cold, wet, meat juice infested tong is gross. They should come up with some other way of handling the meat. I felt like they did offer a variety of meats, veggies, fruits and sauces.   The food came back really fast and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty good for airport food. Huge portions. Had the spicy shrimp chow mein.. it was awesome. needed a little more spice, added one of their hot sauce packets.. did the trick.."}
{"text":"Love it great price! Load your bowl up with meat and the veggies come last.  I got the medium bowl and I could not finish"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I found it to be a very pleasant experience. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. He explained how the process all worked and was very on top of refilling our drinks. My kids really enjoyed being able to make their own bowls and had a lot of fun with it. The meats are fresh and not frozen, there's plenty to choose from as far as topping are concerned. You can sample the sauces to find the one you like the best or you can mix and match. Bottom line was that the food was good, the prices were fair, and the customer service was great. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"It was me and my boyfriends first time eating here and our first impressions were awful. The exterior is really washed out and ugly and then when we go inside we get sat at a dirty table. We had no idea what we were doing and the waitress explained it a bit to us but the guy behind the counter was AWFUL.(he was the guy with the snake bites, dressed like he was still in highschool) He didn't help us at all besides giving us our bowls. He just sat there talking to a girl the whole time. I had no idea was the small container was for, I thought it was for the spices. It was a lot simpler than what it felt like at the time. I just wanted to leave without ordering anything because of how overwhelming it was. Just thinking about the unsupervised raw meat section makes my stomach hurt. The whole place just seemed very unsanitary and the employees seemed lazy. When we finally got our bowls, my boyfriends was half full. The prices are horrendous and the customers do half the work. We decided not to say anything and just never come back. The waitress was great and made our experience slightly better."}
{"text":"This location was better a year ago before they turned it around to make it like all the other ones. I remember back in the day, Happy Hour was all weekend and all well drinks were $2!!  They didn't have all the perks, like the appetizers or \"large\" bowl option, or even the little ordering cards.  I keep going back though, and the food is still tasting good, so I am acclimating. I really like the build-it-yourself philosophy.  Perhaps I am a control freak, but I like to decide how much spice and sauce and broccoli goes into my bowl. I like a lot of broccoli, moderate amount of sauce, and a little spice.  My husband goes the complete opposite route with no broccoli, tons of sauce, and too much spice. It just would not be a complete experience at Genghis Grill if it does not include him pondering that maybe his bowl is too spicy.  Getting back to those appetizers, I suggest skipping them. If you shove down all the contents of your bowl as you  go through the line, a regular bowl is enough food.  We got the edamame last time because it was included in a coupon, and it was mediocre. We also got the ice cream since it was also included in the coupon, and it was also mediocre.  Envision two very small scoops of vanilla ice cream in a small dish, lightly drizzled with chocolate sauce.  That is the sundae. No whip cream, no sprinkles and no cherry on top.   The servers are always friendly and the people watching is usually acceptably entertaining.

{"text":"This place is great ! Fresh ingredients , you make your way , I like that a drink is included in the price of your bowl. Friendly service . The outcome of your work is delicious ! Very filling ! We will for sure make this a regular place to visit ! And they serve booze :)"}
{"text":"For a \"semi-fast-food\" reataurant, Genghis Grill is pretty darn good. For those who have never been, its a mongolian bowl buffet style place, similar to YC. Yoi stack up a bowl full of meats and veggies and rice/noodles and they grill it for you on a giant grill. Plus they have recently added menu dishes such as Asian tacos, chicken skewers and salads, which I think was a great move. Plus they havr super cheap Happy Hour beer and sake bombs!"}
{"text":"This is a choose your own adventure kind of restaurant.  How your food ends up tasting is mostly up to you.  They let you pile up your bowl as high as you want, so go ahead and mash some food down when you're stuffing it.  I was quite impressed with the amount of meats they had.  Chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, ham, turkey.  Big good sized shrimp too by the way.  I can't even remember all the meats.  Most stir-fry places have 3 or 4 meats, this place probably has close to 10.  The next station is seasoning.  There's about 12 options here as well.  I stuck with the cajun spices for the night.  Remember that just a couple of dashes is all you need.  Plenty of vegetables.  Tons of vegetables.  Mini corn, broccali, green beans, spinach, cabbage, pineapple, celery, mushrooms.  Tons of stuff.  Then the sauces.  I was recommended the Szechuan sauce by a friend and it was good.  I don't know what it is exactly....it's like a thin teriyaki sauce? No, that's not right.  I can't describe it.  In any case, it was good.  There was about 10 other sauces: \"stir-fry\" sauce, sweet and sour, teriyaki and more.  Unfortunately for someone who is watching their carbs, every single sauce is thickened up with wheat.  The last station is the \"starches\" which includes a few kinds of rice and a few kinds of noodles.  Tortillas was also an option.  I'm avoiding carbs where I can so I skipped out on this last option.  What really made me happy is that nobody made a big deal or cared about me skipping out on \"filler\" when I was doing the all-you-can-eat option.  With a soda and the all you can eat option, my total for one person before tip was $17.  It's not terribly expensive, but I'm not exactly impressed with the cost."}
{"text":"Genghis grill is the best. I haven't ate here for year, but nothing ever changed. Rather than making a premade recipe, I decided to make my own. Be careful on the seasoning though! A lot of seasoning can tramendously affect the taste. I was a little bit frightened as to see what it is like and tasted. The chef's did not disappoint. I liked it (I got rice noodles). The rice noodles to be honest was a bittle bland, but I got a side of teriyaki sauce and it made the rice noodles more tasty.  The service was decent. The waitress was a little slow but in the end acconplished what we requested.  The atmosphere was clean and welcoming...a little bit dark for lunch time."}
{"text":"This is an Americanized-Imitation of Mongolian BBQ. The taste is okay......There are way to many options out on the floor that aren't favorable. The self serving area always feels so dirty and unorganized. It's always either spilled over or raw food is on the surfaces. The tongs are crossed between raw meats. I do not care for the sauce station as there should be recipes blatant so you may either have a traditional Mongolian taste or make what you like , at this point just know it's way too confusing and it's not worth going. You have keep finding someone because there is no one tending the self serve stations."}
{"text":"We loved the greeting and our server. She explained the process extremely well. Yet, when it's busy and people ahead and behind you, it's a bit overwhelming. It all turned out fine and delicious. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Just came to Ghengis Grill with w family members..My brother was running low on money so he wasn't going to order anything..The owner walked to our table and let us know that they were closing early and that everyone's tab was covered and to enjoy ourselves.   My response was \"are you serious??\" His response \"Yeah...it's Christmas\"  What a blessing!"}
{"text":"This was our second time here and we loved it again. I'm not a great cook so I was admittedly a bit intimidated by having to add my own spices, but it worked out well and both my husband and I enjoyed what we made. The food tastes fresh and flavorful and the staff here is very friendly and accommodating, especially the manager Bill. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"MIKE AND JESS are the BEST bartenders always with great service. Come here at the bar area and they are the greatest and joyest to be around. BEER PRICE AMAZING. ASK JUST ASK AND SAVE. food is also AMAZING."}
{"text":"I guess the concept is cool but unless you know what your doing the food usually comes out just OK. I've been here 4 times and not once had I been blown away with what I created (even when I follow the recipe). P.s. Don't order their potstickers"}
{"text":"I regularly visit here for lunch or dinner but tonight's visit was brief yet exceptional. Our server was John and he was very thorough, professional, and knowledgeable. We will be returning again and again and would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Also, the food is always fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this place! Have been here 4 times now and plan to keep coming. Service is great, especially our server ALYSSA. She was such a sweetheart and made sure we had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Very generous portions, great taste and service is always great. My husband and I come here as often as we can, we love this place."}
{"text":"I've been eating here with a friend for a few years for lunch, a kind of tradition to do before or after seeing a movie at the local theater next door in this trendy outdoor mall. I like putting together my own meal with the meat, veggies and starch I like. The food is well prepared and quite tasty. I looked at the reviews and have had much better luck with the service; it's been very good for us, never a problem.   There have been a few recent changes. There are now three bowl sizes to choose from, and the effect is that to get the same size as before, it costs a few dollars more. While the place is a good lunchtime restaurant, it is a just a bit pricey now for this location. Also, there's a computer tablet at the table. The servers are helpful in showing how to navigate this, although I'm not that high tech so don't really feel the need for this.   Overall, I like the place and will continue to go there when in the area to meet a friend for a movie. I find it better than the other restaurants at this mall location."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I would. The service was terrible from the start. The hostess set us at a very tall table when we had a 7 month old with us. Thanks for the help. When I checked out the where to pick up the bowls, the meat looks slimy and not well kept. When my husband went over there they asked him for some card that we were never given.   We left feeling like we were the problem. We didn't order! They seem to be stuck in social media world and not a real human job.   Terrible!!!"}
{"text":"We frequent this location often on Tuesdays because kids eat free which is wonderful. They also have $1 domestic beers which we appreciate with our meal choices. The food is always abundant and clean. The wait staff is the only downfall of this location and the tables and booths are not always clean which is such a turn off. We will keep going back for the food not the atmosphere."}
{"text":"A caveat to this review is that I love to cook and make my own meal. Guess what; this is the place for control freaks like me. The fresh diversity of meats, chicken and fish; are outstanding! The veggies are very fresh as well. I recommend that you try the sauces first with the little spoons. Here you are master of your own pallet. You can ask them to use less or no oil to make the meal a little healthier. Choose wisely because the portions are as generous as you want to make of them! The owner is awesome and the cast and crew are ubber friendly. There happy hour specials are excellent if your a well drinker. I recommend making yourself a spicy Mongo beef. Use the N.Y strip instead of the sliced beef and you will know where I am coming from!"}
{"text":"It's the whitest Mongolian Barbecue EVER. And not in a good way. What kind of Mongolian place serves tortillas and pepperoni?! No thank you.  The only reason it doesn't get one star is that it didn't taste horribile."}
{"text":"Loved this place their first year.  I keep going back hoping for what we loved at first but it's just not there.  No more shrimp or shelled edamame to add to your bowl.  Prices are ridiculous for less than what they used to give.  The only reason to go these days is the cool Coke machine.  It's right next to the Sunset Station who has a better mongolian grill and you get the whole buffet for less than what these guys charge.  Wish you'd stayed as good as when you opened."}
{"text":"Holy crap, out of all restaurant I picked this place.   Food: the Mongolian rice was hard and the veges was not cooked at all. Orange chicken was so nasty, it should be called bell pepper chicken not orange.   Serivce: let's say the girl was not very responsive.  But I do give 2 stars for the manager being so polite and letting us know how everything worked.   Overall I probably would not be returning."}
{"text":"Self serve Mongolian Grill in the Las Vegas suburbs.  You get a choice of three different sizes of bowls to start. You bring your bowl to the selection bar. You start by filling your bar with your choice of meat and/or seafood. You then add vegetables, fruit, and spices. You then bring your bowl to the grill area. You can tell the chef to add up to two grains like rice or noodles. The chef takes your bowl and cooks its contents.  The waitress will bring your bowl to your table when it is ready.  I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and process. The waitstaff was friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a super fan on this place! Anytime I'm in control of amount and portion size I'm going to be a happy camper! This is a great place to go when you can't decided on what to eat! With it being build your own stir fry everyone's happy because they can customize!"}
{"text":"When you walk into Genghis grill, they ask if you've ever been there before while they assemble steel bowls.  Yes, of course I have, I answer as I'm led to a table and I order drinks. Then I take my battered little bucket (you feel like a Unicef kid for a minute) and head to the assembly area, and here is where Genghis Grill outshines their competition.  The quality of the meats, seafood and vegetable is clearly a cut above almost every other Mongolian Grill type establishment.  Since I don't eat meat I put some shrimp and scallops in the bowl, and assemble my favorite mix.  I do not recommend cramming too much meat into your bowl -- a juvenile mistake I see made by kids with bad skin and future cardiac issues.   Take it easy on the sauces since they are laden with sodium and oil.  You will be pleasantly surprised at the volume of food that your bowl + rice/noodle mix will create.   Friendly staff and a decent selection of beers.  As others have noted, it can take time to get your check and get out the door.  In noting some other reviews I think I think it would be helpful for Genghis Grill to really emphasize that overdoing the sauces will just destroy your meal."}
{"text":"As always, a bowl full of different foods all comes to the table perfectly cooked.   The manager Tommy was super helpful dealing with a a difficult food allergy at the table.   We used to come here all the time when we lived a block away. We will now be driving across the city to be regulars."}
{"text":"I love genghis grill. I wish they had all you can eat so I can give it 5 stars. This place is better than stir krazy which I don't understand how that place got a higher review rating than genghis grill. They have a lot of options and their price is decent. It's a little cheaper for lunch time. I go here often for Mongolian BBQ"}
{"text":"Mmmm mmmm good!  I love me some Mongolian food!  Went with a friend on a Sunday around 5:00 and there really wasn't a wait at all which was great since we were hungry!  The host was very friendly as was our server who greeted us right away to take our drink orders.  As soon as that was done we made our way to the fresh ingredient area.  I was pleasantly surprised to see what I would consider an above average selection of various meats and vegetables available.  Marinated steak anyone?  Pineapple?  I think I will!  I also loved that you can pick from different options to go along with your food (steamed rice, fried rice, noodles, tortillas, and a couple others I can't remember).  I chose the fried rice and I'm proud to admit that I ate the whole bowl, it was delicious!  Next time I'm up this way I'll definitely be making a pit stop here!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few different Genghis Grills and I have to say this location has been the best one so far thanks to their staff.  Everyone I came into contact with was friendly from the hostess to the guy stocking the veggies to the cook to my actual waiter.  They all said hello and made conversation as I went about everything which was nice.  My waiter almost verged on being TOO attentive which I know sounds crazy but in the 20-25 minutes I was there he came over to check on me 6 times and that's no exaggeration.  Not to mention he seemed to keep cleaning the same table and re-arranging the same chairs nearby my table multiple times.  He was nice though and it's better to have a server who's too attentive rather than one you can't seem to get to come to your table.  My only gripe with all the Genghis Grills has got to be the ingredient station.  Everything tastes wonderful when it's cooked but it just seems like no matter what time of day I go in, the ingredients look like they're last nights leftovers.  Just not very fresh looking.  I'm sure it's hard to keep them looking fresh as they're sitting out exposed but couldn't you just switch them out a little more frequently?"}
{"text":"As a self-described Genghis Grill junky this one left me feeling less than high.  Stopped in to grab some takeout so that I could rent Safe Haven and watch it at home with the bestie (great movie btw) on a Wednesday night around 8:30.  It wasn't busy so the hostess greeted us right away and told us the procedure for takeout, load up the bowls, pay at the bar and they'll bring us the food.  We made our way through the ingredient stations and got up to the area where you tell them what kind of starches you want.  I asked for brown rice and then waited for my friend to finish with her ingredients.  She got the Udon noodles which then caused the guy cooking everything to come back to me and start asking if I was sure I wanted brown rice, because I could get noodles instead!  He concluded with asking if I was trying to be healthy.  Uhhhh, maybe I am or maybe I'm not, regardless just give me the food I ask for without an argument!!!  After that we headed to the bar to wait and pay.  However none of the 3-4 servers/bartenders/anyone stopped to find out what we needed until we'd been sitting there for a while.  Finally the one girl who actually looked like she was busy came over to help us and get our checks for us.  It was just not the level of quality I expect from Genghis and I was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price.  The happy hour is fantastic and the quality of the meat, veggies and the overall food is fabulous.  This is much better than the other Mongolian BBQ places around Phoenix and Scottsdale.  VERY clean.  The beef was fresh and of high quality.. not stringy.  The chicken is also fresh and the marinated lime chicken is awesome.  The fresh vegitables and the sauces are what make the place a great option!"}
{"text":"Agree with a review below about changing to different bowl sizes and what not does seem like they're trying to nickel and dime you. You make your own bowl so if you don't like it,  it is your fault. Never had a bad time, try a fishbowl great drink for two. Though new electronic check out is annoying. Takes up to much room on table when with four people, and the servers dont have much to do with it being a self service."}
{"text":"I love Genghis Grill. We went most recently because I had a birthday coupon from them for a free bowl, but I've been there several times before and each time this place has been consistently tasty. I like building my own meal from their provided options, and somehow I always manage to make mine pretty darn good. I do think it is a little expensive, but then again you can go ahead and pile up the meat and veggies in your bowl if you want to get the most food for your money.   The only downside is that the place is pretty crowded (tables and benches are placed close together) and often pretty loud. They haven't been as busy the past few times I've been there, but I think that's because it's summer and the ASU kids have cleared out.  This is our usual stop when we are at the Tempe Marketplace. It's hard to resist."}
{"text":"First off, I read all the negative reviews about the food not tasting good, too little sauce, the food sits outs.  YOU PEOPLE ARE INSANE!!!!1 1. if you don't like your bowl, pick different things to put in your bowl, if its not enough sauce ask for more sauce, and you don't like that the meat sits out??? even though its over ice (which is tested to make sure its at proper temperature) then ask for the meat in the walk in.   all the complaints are retarded cause YOU MAKE YOUR OWN BOWL WITH THE FREEDOM TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT!!! 'merica  On a serious note, I personally love love love ghengis grill. I have yet to have a bad server, I love the food and have never had an issue. the manager always comes over to make sure the food tastes good. (hello people if it doesn't, tell them. they will get you something new). It is a little pricey but when your stacking the bowl so high you bring home enough leftovers for a whole new meal then I cant complain.  Ghengis is one of my favorite spots for sure."}
{"text":"You build you're own bowl so if it tastes horrible you're to blame. The variety of ingredients is pretty decent but overall there really isn't anything special about this place. The quality is pretty average and their limited menu for appetizers is a little disappointing.   Good if you really need a quick bite and don't want to give into the temptation of fast food."}
{"text":"Not your typical Mongolian Grill, this place is great, why? Because you make the menu! They have a wide array of items to put in your bowl. Well that sounds quite typical of a Mongolian Grill! I heard someone say. Ok so here is the not typical part: They have things not normally found at a Mongolian Grill such as Pepperoni! I should also mention the incredible selection of sauces. They also have a great loyalty club! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Great selection of meats, vegtables, sauces and seasonings.  Fun for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for some asian food.   It was a bit confusing at first since the waitresses don't really tell you how the process works. There aren't any signs either, especially when it comes to pricing. To this day, I'm not really sure how much my regular bowl was since my friend paid for my meal. Although, I'm surprised there were many options to put in your bowl compared to your typical Mongolian style restaurant.   I would probably not come back to this place."}
{"text":"The food is just okay.  I think having servers, a hostess, and a bar is an excuse to charge more.  YC's is a simpler set-up, it's cheaper, and you get more food.  Enough said."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that Charlotte finally has a Mongolian barbecue. And I'm doubly excited that it's just up the road from my office. Yeah for Genghis Grill for getting SO much right out of the gate. First of all, they have done an excellent job hiring enthusiastic servers who seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Second, they have the whole food allergy thing completely under control -- even gluten-free! Third, they have a full bar, so while your kids chow down on 2 or 3 bowls of noodles and such, you can actually have a cocktail or beer and enjoy the experience.   Lunch or dinner, I think this place is a slam dunk, if you want an easy dining experience that is sure to please everyone in your group."}
{"text":"My wife enjoyed her meal, but I'm pretty picky when I experience the same style of food that I've had before, YC's in particular. After being seated, we grabbed our bowls and headed towards the food line. There were three rows of food and condiments. The third row was a little difficult to get to. None of the employees were paying attention to the food. You could see where people had gotten something and it spilled onto the edge of another container of food. The setup was totally inefficient. The selections were so-so. I was surprised that we could only order our noodles or rice at the end. For noodles, they used soba noodles which are a lot thicker than YC's and THEY control the portion. WHERE's THE NOODLES!! And that is one reason out of several, why I won't be back."}
{"text":"AWESOME place to eat. With the kids also. Lunch and dinner are great! Dined here multiple times and never waited to get a seat. Staff is super friendly and helpful explaining the process in case you've never been there. Also, the kids loved how they make the giant flames over the flattop grill at dinner time!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this spot. It's close to home and the food is good. The staff has always been welcoming and helpful.   How does it work? The hostess will seat you and then a server stops by to give you a card that you'll take through the line. The first thing you'll choose in the line is the size of the bowl. I always choose the smallest because you'll add stuff at the end that will make the portion larger than it seems. The first section of food is all meat and seafood. Next up is vegetables and seasonings. The final section contains a variety of sauces. Lastly, you'll take it to the grill area where you can add options like eggs, fried rice, udon noodles, or pasta to name a few. While you wait you grab your drink and head back to the table to wait for the server to bring your food.  What do I love about it? You can create a variety of flavors and themes when choosing your meal. The meats, sauces, seasonings, and vegetables can be changed up on every visit to create completely different meals. One visit could be sweet-n-sour chicken and another visit could be a seafood dish with curry seasoning. The bowls come up pretty quickly so it's a nice cross between fast food and full service dining. The cost of the bowl is reasonable for the amount of food and a low cost option for a quick lunch or dinner. They also have a reward card to get a bowl free after 10 purchases."}
{"text":"As these types of places go it was well below average.  A.better choice would be YC's at Indian Bend near the 101.  This place was not big on being clean and tidy.  Ingredients were not fresh looking on bar.  Presented a bowl that host had his fingers in.  Asked for another and was accommodated but he looked stunned.  All in all a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"I finally found an opportunity to visit this place and I was pleasantly surprised.  This is still the new kid on the block in this area, and as this was our first time, we were not alone with the new dining experience.  You hear people mention that you do all but cook the food, this is true, but let me add one thing......if you choose a variety of sauces, this will end up as one sauce.  This is a bowl of food that you choose from a raw and uncooked state.  You place it into a small stainless dish that is kept at the hostess stand that she wipes out with a towel, and is handed to you as you enter.  After working in restaurants for a very long time, I am never comfortable placing raw chicken and shaved meat together in one bowl, especially with veggies.  This is like a lazy mans \"Japanese Restaurant\" where you sit at individual tables instead of around the grill master.  It was interesting, but for the small bowl ($9.99) it just did not seem to be a great value.  The staff was friendly, the location was clean, but I am sure that even though the food gets cooked, raw chicken, raw meat, and seafood, do not need to reside in a bowl with uncooked veggies.  May visit again, using just one meat, and one sauce.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"Well this place is really neat. The only way you wont like your food is if you screw it up. i recommend that for your first time you get the endless bowl and dont pile the stuff on when you go through the line. That way if you really hate it you can start over! There are recipe cards at the beginning of the line, which we did not use. You will choose your proteins first. a great variety of beef, chicken, pork, sausage, shrimp, calamari, scallops etc. next choose your spices, a little goes a long way and remember that you have the choice of sauces at the end of the line too. the dragon salt I am told is very spicy next choose your vegetables a great selection of raw vegetables and some fruits even pico de galo, there is whole eggs there too if you like that in your stir fry.  at the end you can choose your sauce, leave it off all together or have them cook it in or maybe take it to your table to add yourself. there are small spoons to taste the different sauces, but please be courtious to the patrons behind you throughout the line and donw linger in one area to long.  next approach the cooking station and tell them what starch you would like, I myself loved the noodles in mine, my husband gets the fried rice.  take your number card to your table and place it in the stand that is on your table, if you have several cards fan them out so the servers can see it and bring you the bowl when finished cooking.   my husband has a rewards card and if you live near here is it well worth it! you can get free bowls really quickly! this is a fun expereince for children since it is almost like they are making there own meal, in a sense they are except for the actual cooking!  We will go again!"}
{"text":"This was a fun place to eat,  you can build your own bowl (like a typical mongolian restaurant) and they have an unlimited option for $4 more which is great for trying different creations.  One thing i really liked was the \"starch\"  options. They offer noodles and rice,  but also offer things like tortillas which adds a whole new element. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I love options, which Genghis has plenty of. I'm still perfecting my bowl of noodles (udon, of course), but I'm getting there through much experimentation. Every time we come here, we somehow seem to always get the same waiter, which is great because he's so attentive. Plus, he suggested a side of sour cream and cheese to accompany my tortillas--good call. Anyway, the food stations are always well cleaned and well stocked during the days I've been. The chefs at the grill have smiled and greeted me. My steak is not overcooked and my veggies still have the right amount of crunch.   I like coming by for happy hour, when they have three kinds of house wines that are $4/glass. The same wines are available for their Wednesday deal for two bowls and a bottle for $25, which made our date night last week. And this location will sometimes give away free bowls if you say a certain phrase that they post on their Facebook page, so keep a look out!"}
{"text":"The first thing that stood out as soon as I entered this establishment was the fact that it was empty. The waitress came to our table and immediately hounded us with questions. We weren't even sitting yet! She also brought along 9 bowls with her in 3 varying sizes. She wasn't wearing any gloves, and the bowls were not on any trays. She asked us for our name and bowl size and then handed each of us a card and a bowl. I have been to two different Genghis in AZ so I found this particular practice odd and off putting. I am used to going to the food area and being handed there a bowl on a tray from someone wearing gloves. Also keep in mind that she brought 9 bowls and there were only 3 of us.. I can only assume that those remaining 6 bowls would be carried back to where ever she got them and used later because I certainly can't see them throwing those 6 bowls in the wash. Especially if this is the normal practice each time a customer comes in.. That would be a lot of unused bowls to be washed. So imagine how many times those unused bowls go back and forth between tables and how many times the waitress has to touch them (without gloves) and how many different waitresses end up touching the same bowl. Very unsanitary! This little practice alone caused us to leave and I am so glad I did. On the way out I noticed that they had a C grade! When there is raw meat sitting out, a C grade is very scary."}
{"text":"I come here pretty regularly. It's good food and it's pretty fun creating your own delicacy. I wouldn't recommend putting bacon in your bowl. I put a little piece and it made my bowl too greasy."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different locations and they have all been consistently great. Clean restaurant, the service is good, and plenty of food.   This style of making your own food is right up my alley - I like to customize my food. This also gives everyone a choice and is vegan/vegetarian friendly.   All the sauces have their own unique taste and while I've never really experienced Mongolian food before, I was pleasantly surprised at the variety. I usually pile my bowl high with tofu, spinach, watercress, and a handful of other veggies, and then accompany that with a spicy sauce - so satisfying.   The recipe cards are nice if you want to try a different dish or feel intimidated by all the choices. And there are small spoons to sample the sauces before you commit to one. Starches include fried, steamed, and brown rice; udon noodles; spiral pasta; and more. Portion sizes are fair - I leave full but not stuffed. Honestly, I hate that feeling, so I am happy to find a place that let's me finish my plate without gaining 5 lbs.  I haven't tried dessert yet but I was super tempted... Will most likely order it next time."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this particular location and I absolutely love the food! It is a hit or miss depending on how good you make your own bowl. The first few times I tried it, it turned out tasting a little weird. By now though I know exactly what to put in it to make it taste delicious!  My only small issue is the service. The service isn't horrible but it isn't fantastic either. I don't like how they bring your drinks to your table while you are in line. I would prefer them bring the drinks when I am back at the table instead of having my drink sit there unaccompanied."}
{"text":"This was such a bad experience. It was freezing cold inside. They burned both of our bowls, they remade them & still burnt 1 of those. 3 out of 4 of our attempted bowls were burnt! They asked us to come back & give them another chance. I DO NOT want to pay for more burnt food! Their attempts at correcting our food was not good. Now he is expecting us to pay for more burnt food?!? I am so unhappy & will not return. I do NOT RECOMMEND Ghengis Grill on Stephanie St in Henderson, NV. Save your time & money for unburnt food elsewhere"}
{"text":"Genghis Grill is usually one of my favorite fast food restaurants, but I was pretty disappointed with this location. Usually, much of the Genghis Grill experience comes from hand-picking your ingredients, preparing your bowl with different combinations of meats, rices/noodles, vegetables, sauces, and seasonings, then watching it all come together on a huge hibachi-esque grill. The airport location does away with all that, and ultimately you're left with unsatisfying, generic takeout-quality Asian food.  I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki bowl, which fell way short of my expectations. First off, it was way too salty and oily - there was practically a layer of oil at the bottom of the container when I was done. There was also a very skewed ratio of carrots and onions to chicken and rice, which generally just didn't make for a very appetizing or pleasant meal.  The customer service at this location is great, and the line moves quickly. I really, really can't say much that is supportive about the food quality here, though. Next time I'm in CLT, I'm positive that I won't be eating here."}
{"text":"Terrible food! I've been to better Mongolian grills at a mall than this place.  You get small not very clean looking metal bowls that you have to cram your food selection into while trying not to throw your back out reaching like a contortionist for those back row items. The quality of the food is poor, the cooking is random, service is hit & run. 2 of us ate halfway through our less than mediocre bowls while one of us sat waiting for their bowl to come out. I ordered mine with the \"fried rice\"...most disgusting brown colored steamed (not fried) rice that tasted like it sat all day long waiting for a sucker like me to order it. For a week night dinner...3 bowls and 3 drinks with tip, our bill came to $50...WTF?! I could have gone across the street to Tony Roma's if I wanted to spend that! My stomach & wallet have banned this place for me."}
{"text":"Ok, no one can complain about the chef here because you are it! You never have to worry about whether you can find a dish that fits your eating style that day. I love all the different combinations that are possible! My favorite is chicken, shrimp, garlic, salt, pepper & onions, zucchini, cabbage, scallions and 3G sauce. They recently added calamari and brown rice. You can add an egg to your dish. Each bowl comes with your choice of carbs: tortillas, rice, noodles, etc. It's quick and tasty. They have the ambience of a McDonald's: not a place to sit with girlfriends and gab really, but perfect for when you want a good healthy meal alternative to fast food.  They actually have a good selection of drinks, wine and beers, along with Edame and potstickers to go with them. For those who don't know what ingredients to put together, they have recipe cards you can follow and a staff that is happy to walk you through it. The Tuxedo Bomb dessert was fabulous! Whenever I approach a buffet, I try to take items off the bottom, where the temperature tends to be more ideal, so take your raw meat from the bottom of the pan if you can, so it has been kept really cold."}
{"text":"The food was a solid 4, very fresh & flavorful! They do not have the variety that the full Grill has, but they have 7 different combinations, all of which sounded yummy, and 2 appetizers plus beer & wine. The side carbs include brown rice & Udon noodles, so that was perfect for me. I had the Mongo Bowl: tasty Mongolian BBQ Beef & Veggies, slightly sweet & piquant. Their food score was 97, which is great for an airport food court. So why a 2? The small Asian lady in charge of the grill area which is completely open to the public spent almost the entire time yelling at the young man grilling our food. To his credit, he never raised his voice in return, but she had the customers so disturbed that after someone would place an order, they all stood at a distance. I could still hear her yelling after I took my order to the food court seating behind a short wall. It was so unprofessional, rude and just made her look totally absurd. PS: the young man in question did a great job of cooking our food, so I couldn't tell you what her issue was. I hope she's not the owner..."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of grillin' Mongolian style.  I love Asian food in general, so this is right up my alley.  (I must be out of the loop and super-uncool because I have absolutely no idea what this YC is that you speak of...)  I feel this place has taken a lot of mistakes of other Mongolian grills and learned from them  Here's the lowdown on the pros and cons...  Pros: **A wide selection of everything!  Meats offer the traditional steak, chicken, pork, but also options such as shrimp, crab (albeit imitation), scallops, and tofu.  Veggies have pepper and onion combos, mandarin oranges, celery, raw egg, and a few other options that I haven't seen at other establishments.  The starches are more than white rice here - they offer brown rice and udon noodles too.  **Seasonings and sauces.  They have a bunch of seasonings to put on your meat before you pile on the veggies.  I think this is a good idea.  I have no idea if my shrimp was more or less tasty because I did it, but it made me feel better having another option to make it my own.  Their sauces are all sugar based and they add them at the end (which is a plus) so they don't burn.  The how-to list of concoctions is handy, but I like to be brave and go it alone.  It's definitely a trial and error process.  **Price.  I think $8 is reasonable for a large bowl of Mongolian grill.  Granted, there are some tips and tricks to getting the most out of your dollar (pile high and push it down my friends) and some strategery to the order of which you load on your veggies.  **Happy hour.  I can't remember what all of their drink specials are, but I know there are $2 wells and they make 'em strong. Nuff said.  Cons: **The all-you-can-eat propaganda.  As a person who never makes the most of a buffet, all-you-can-eat is not really for me.  I think how it works here is that you can go back and do a second+ bowl and move up to the $12 bracket.  I like a lot of veggies and I had a hard time getting all I wanted in the bowl (yes, even with all of the tips and tricks), but I would have willingly paid the $12 to get two bowls at the get go to make one bad mamma jamma of a stir-fry.  Maybe next time I'll see if I can finagle...  **Assembly line set-up.  You can only serve from one side of the item line and let me say, it can be a little daunting.  For a first timer taking their time and getting it all worked out, you start to feel the pressure as the line builds behind you.  It's not a process in which I like to be rushed.  It's not a big deal and people can go around or whatnot, but it's not very conducive to serving a lot of people at once.  I'll definitely be back to have another go at it.  Skip YC's and go straight to Genghis Grill, or so I've been told..."}
{"text":"I went here with some coworkers for lunch.  Some of them raved about the place and the concept and I had to experience it for myself.    You are seated first and your server takes your drink order.  She then asks if anyone is new and then takes you over to the buffet and explains everything to you.  You have a bowl that you fill with your proteins of choice, spices, veggies and sauces.  Then you take it up to the counter and order your starch and you get a number.  They cook your order on a round grill and then bring it out to you.  Pretty simple really.  The hard part is perfecting your own recipe.  There are a few recipe cards available to use as a guide. You can also check their website beforehand to get ideas.  The selections for your bowl are extensive.  For proteins you have everything from beef and chicken to calamari and pepperoni.  Pepperoni??  lol.  Must be for the kids.  Spice and sauce mixtures range from teryaki to curry and veggies consist of everything under the sun.  This is a chain restaurant that everyone should try at least once.  I need to go back and perfect my recipe."}
{"text":"We came to have lunch today and had an issue for the first time. Honestly, I've worked in the industry so I know it's going to happen eventually. It could have been very upsetting but for the most part I was happy with how it was handled. My husband ordered a medium build your own bowl and I ordered a large. Mine arrived first and seemed small but I thought maybe I was over thinking it. But when my husbands arrived and was WAY bigger, I knew there had been a mistake somewhere. We told our waitress, Sandy, and she went to her manager to resolve the issue. We weren't sure what was happening until she came back about five minutes later. She told us she fixed our bill and we were only charged for a small. But the problem was, we wanted a large. The price was never the issue. When we told her she sort of cut us off and said she can't do anything and she will go get her manager. The manager, kelly, came to our table and asked how we would like to resolve it all. She was very polite about it. I asked how much another small bowl would cost because I'm honestly still hungry and the small was gone at this point. She said that the bowl is on them, which was very kind. We never wanted a free meal, just a big one. I think my server misunderstood that. But I'm glad the manager fixed the experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service everytime we go they are very consistent ! Like this place , they closed ours here in Tucson so it was great to see they are still around ."}
{"text":"The manager of this store is so unbelievably offensive I will never come here again. After my roommate complained that there was a hair in her food the manager came over looked at the bowl then turned to me and said \"are you sure this isn't your hair?\" Im sorry but are you kidding me? Even if that was supposed to be a joke that was made in extremely poor taste and offended the rest of my party sitting with me. Who ever told this guy he was funny should be slapped."}
{"text":"This place use to be good but now you only get one trip and have to pay upwards of 15 dollars for one bowl.  The whole point of this style of eating is to be able to experiment new creations and try maybe a couple small trips.  I am very sad they changed and as the waitress mentioned they have a lost a lot of business including ours now.  If management knows they are losing business maybe they should revert back to how this style of eating should be.  Last time I'll be there!"}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful to practice on your architecture skills. Also, the food is great and priced well. I highly suggest this place to eat for Lunch or dinner. Pile it high!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go. There are so many choices to put in your bowl and it all taste so good. I love how they have the gluten-free rice noodles and of course they are really good, my favorite choice of noodle. My mother-in-law has all sorts of food allergies (gluten-free, dairy free, grain free) and she was able to pick choices out easy. And that is the ultimate test if you ask me."}
{"text":"You decide on the ingredients, they cook it. It's as simple as that. But even better, the service by an excellent staff is top notch. Our kids especially LOVED Genghis Grill."}
{"text":"I love this place you get a big bowl u pick your meats,veggies,and/or fruit plus seasonings and sauce give it to the grill cooks they prepare your food on this giant grill,then give it to the waiter who then brings it to your tabl,it is so good,I go all the time,love it"}
{"text":"This is located at the airport inside the US Airways terminal. Great place if you are in the mood to consume something nourishing, and healthy. I had the vegetarian dish called the Buddha Bowl. It was pretty good, and filling. It was also very inexpensive. In today's economy, that's a good thing."}
{"text":"Oh how I wish it weren't so...but alas...it is. My family and I USED to love this place. We were sorely disappointed with last nights experience.  We've seen this place sink from an awesome, friendly place with great food to a dirty, disorganized place with deplorable \"service\". When we complained to one of the servers we recognized,  he told us that their manager walked out recently and the new one doesn't have the same standards. Well...that explains some of it. But...it doesn't explain our servers attitude or my family's food poisoning.  Yup.. that's right...everyone's sick. Do yourself a favor, go to YC's if you want Mongolian....stay clear of this mess."}
{"text":"This was my first time in here and probably my last! It started off with the hostess and her little attitude that she had since we asked for a better seat. Then while in line the guy behind the counter was not very helpful at all and the customers behind us were so rude and obnoxious dude dry humping his buddy! Then the guys who cook your food have an attitude of their own and got sauce on me as he \"chucked\" the empty bowls into whatever is back behind their area. None of this was okay at all! The food sucks here to endure all of that nonsense!"}
{"text":"It was OK. My \"Buddhist Udon Noodles\" were tasty, but very salty. My wife's Special Fried Rice was salty, but not tasty. Overall better than edible, but not great by any stretch. And at $10 per, not a great value (a lot of mediocre food for a lot of money doesn't constitute a great value, y'all.).   If you're hungry, you can do worse, and unfortunately, it's hard to do better. There just aren't many good value meals at CLT. Charlotte's a pretty nice airport ... except for the food."}
{"text":"if you dont like it, its your fault lol. my husband and i love cokong here randomly. I usuaply mix two different chickens, one plain and one spicy. youcant go wrong with salt pepper a linch of curry and onion and an abundant amount of veggies!"}
{"text":"This place is great...I don't know why I don't come here more often! For those that haven't been, you basically have three different bowl sizes to choose from. You can load it up with as many veggies and protein as you can. They have a lot of different options and even have recipe cards if you don't feel like making your own, but would rather just follow one of their recommendations. You have a few different starch choices and within minutes, your food is delivered to your table.   I usually get the medium bowl and it's enough for two meals for me! This place is a great deal, can be relatively healthy depending on what you put in your bowl, and very quick.   I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. This was first time at this establishment. After taking our drink order, the waitress disappeared. After five minutes, I had to ask another employee what to do. What I didn't know was that I had to take a table card with me, so I had to leave the counter to go back to the table to get one. We told the counter staff that this was our first time. The girl was a little helpful in telling us to fill our bowls about half full with meat and then add vegetables. What we weren't told was that there was an additional charge of $4 if we decided to go back in the line and add more meat to our bowl. There were small print sign posted; however, we were more concerned about the food choices, not looking around.   Food choices were basic: mushrooms, cabbage, mini ears of corn (cut small), onions, green onions, peas, carrots, spinach. At least 1/4 of the bins were empty. There were several choices from which to choose, and there were several sauce choices. The final choice was that of starch plus cabbage was included.  After being cooked, our food was brought to us. The flavor was ok. However, it appeared that the grill hadn't been cleaned of previous cooking because we found food in our meal that we hadn't added. They probably came from food cooked before us."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and boy I wasn't disappointed! Everyone was super friendly and helpful, explained how we order and such. And the food is delicious! Got shredded beef with some veggies and the udon and it was amazing! Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Always amazing sometimes the chicken is suspect(fatty). But I love the tortillas with scream( sour cream). I would go here more if it was closer to my house. Sign up online for a free one on your bday."}
{"text":"Ive always loved stir frys and enjoyed building my own. Here however everything was limited. I started with a small bowl because i didnt want to eat too much. The bowl was WAY too small to fit more than a few pieces of veggies in. When i realized i cant fit anything, i changed it to regular (which apparently requires permission from the manager). I managed to fit the rest in the regualr bowl, however i wasnt allowed to go back to the meat, so i ended up with mostly veggies.  The stir fry was mostly noodles and didnt have much mixed in due to the small portion bowls provided. Was also expensive for the amount given. The atmosphere and service were fantastic, but not the best stir fry ive had."}
{"text":"I had been here once as a non-Yelper and I really liked it. This time I went in with high expectations and was disappointed by the customer service and the \"food display\". However, I love Mongolian BBQ and really enjoyed the food I got here.  Customer Service: We were told once we sat down that they were not serving menu items that night with no explanation of what that meant. We were then asked if we wanted anything to drink without a drink menu or being told what was available. The server seemed to be in a hurry, so my wife and I both went with water. We got a very short and confusing description of how to build our bowls, again she seemed to be in a hurry. We realized once we got up that she wanted to get back to her friends a few tables down so she could sit and talk with them. I hope we didn't interrupt her conversation by wanting to have a pleasant dinner experience at her establishment.  On our way to the \"food display\" I noticed the bartender was scrubbing the bar floor. The middle of dinner time didn't seem like the most opportune time to clean the floors. I was glad I didn't order a drink.  The \"food display\" was a mess and very unappetizing. Once I saw the meats I considered asking my wife if she wanted to leave. Some meats were mislabeled or not labeled at all and some were mixed in with others. The biggest thing was the gross way they were displayed. They need to find a better way to display them. Lots of bowls of raw meat isn't very appetizing. The spices were a bit confusing. The vegetables were poorly cut and disheveled. The girl behind the counter wasn't much help either. I thought they had recipes on the wall that you could follow, if they didn't they need them. If they did, they need to bring them back.  Overall, I liked the food, but I had some issues with the way the establishment was organized and run. It seemed a bit pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"Buddhist bowl.  Awful, the use canned bamboo shoots and other canned ingredients.  Asked for extra spicy, instead of cooking with peppers, they give a container of hot sauce.  Manchu wok was 10x better"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Kids really enjoy picking all their ingredients.  Plus they have lunch pricing.  If you leave here hungry, then you didn't stack your bowl high enough.  The only limit is how well you stack your ingredients.  The Spice Trail has so many delicious spices on it.  Lots of great choices for your bowl."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant was packed when we got there.  We were seated very quickly and given a little stainless steel bowl for our stir fry.    We proceeded to the bar where we added various different types of fresh meats, spices, veggies, and sauces.  We turned the bowl into the grill and they cooked it with whatever starch you request (rice, udon noodles, etc).  They were really busy for lunch so there were some lines for the grill but it wasn't bad.  The waitress bought out our stir fry once it was cooked and it we both thought it was really good.  The staff is very friendly, I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Needed something quick. Disappointed. I got the edamame but it's under done and cold. I built a bowl and it's tasty but my broccoli is also really under done. It's like a bowl of steaming shrimp and rice, yummy pineapple and carrots and the broccoli...all but raw broccoli. In between connections and no time to ask them to make it right. Will hold me over but still a disappointment."}
{"text":"Interesting concept if you're looking for something different.  Personally I was overwhelmed by the ordering process.  You're seated at your table, get an ordering card (size of a box card), go pick up a recipe card, tell the server what size bowl you want, then pile up your bowl with your ingredients and sauces based on your selected recipe, and then at the end of the cafeteria style line, hand it over to the cook who grills it on a huge grill.  Food was good and portion sizes were abundant but it was too complicated between the various servers and cooks and knowing what to put in your bowl..."}
{"text":"First time I had Ghangus Grill was in Fort Collins Colorado. Was so pleasantly surprised when I discovered there was one in Las Vegas. Staff is always friendly and remember our group (as we've become regulars)!  Food is a refreshing change from the typical dining out. Selections are always fresh, and everyone can get what they want.  Great way to grab a quick but healthy bite for lunch"}
{"text":"I will never ever go here for dinner again!!! The staff is too rude for us?I just took the wrong glass of cocktail from my friend's side without id and didn't taste even one sip. The staff just took our cocktails directly without any explanation. He ruined my Thursday night?"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on a Friday night around 5 pm with my GF. I had been to YC's Mongolian Grill, which I really enjoyed but at YC's I felt like something was lacking. Don't get me wrong, YC's is good stuff, but sometimes I want to have something spicy or more savory and I feel that YC's sauces aren't very thick. I like Pei Wei because of their thick sauces, and yes, none of this food is 'authentic' Chinese food or whatever (I hate those sort of nuts). Enjoy the food for what it is.  The service was good. Nothing stellar, the server brings you water and brings you your food after you have created your delectable and dropped it off to the grill master. You are seated while your food is cooked, and this is a great thing because it takes maybe 5-10 minutes for your food to cook (if you wait it'll cause a huge fart in the line). We did the unlimited to try more stuff, and the server always took out plates and offered us another bowl if we needed. Food was always out promptly. I thought it was hilarious that the guy working on the grill hits the gong when there are a ton of bowls ready.  The buffet line was decent. I'm being a little picky here, but I think if you're going to do a buffet sort of thing, you better keep it stocked with fresh items. There were a few times I went to make a bowl and there was old chicken laying around with chicken juice just marinating the chicken. That's not very appealing. To their defense though, the other items remained stocked pretty well. The cubed beef looked very fresh and lean, not a lot of fat hanging around, just enough to taste good. Vegetables and stuff were stocked pretty well too, sauces area was kept clean and there was plenty of sauce when I went.  The cooking was mediocre. The first bowl I got was cooked well, except the noodles weren't as hot as the rest of the food, which found its way to the bottom. They managed to keep the sauces saucy and mixed it well into the food. I was turned off by the fact that the cooks were throwing tin and stuff into the corner and making a racket. Not professional at all. My GF complained that some of the food was overcooked, and while I somewhat agree, I have a higher range of acceptable cooking ranges. I'll eat rare all the way up to well done, my GF won't. I didn't get any rare, but I got some very well done, with some charring on my steak and chicken.  Great atmosphere, I could definitely go here and have a bowl while watching a game. Seems busy and the crowd is well-mannered, except for these idiot teenagers who were reaching over me in the buffet line. Don't mind them though, they're probably just idiots anyways.  Pricing is kind of an issue. Unlimited for $14 (after student discount) is something that might keep me from going back. I could potentially get just as much food from Pei Wei for less. Yes, its not going to be the same, but the two styles are very similar. If you like Pei Wei you will like this place. If you want Pei Wei, but buffet style sort of you should try this place out. You can get just a bowl for $10, but even that is a little too steep for a college student's pocket. I'd say unlimited + drinks for $12 and just a bowl with drinks for $8.50 is much more fair. I really don't even get drinks usually, but its nice to have it offered with the 'package'.   I'm really torn between giving this place a 3 or a 4. I like to reserve my 4s and 5s for places that I will go to whether I have a craving for it or not. I mean, if I'm hungry but I'm not sure where to go, I can count on a place that will always suffice and be cheap. The meat and toppings were very fresh, the fried rice and noodles option is great, but the pricing is a major issue. If the pricing goes down, I'd love to take my family there, and I'd love to rave about it. Until then, I think a 3 is sufficient."}
{"text":"Being a lifelong YC's patron, my interest was piqued when I saw there was another Mongolian bbq restaurant in Tempe.  To short-cut to the differences between the two, Genghis Grill:  -Has smaller bowls, so smaller portions as a result -Has more selection, with more expensive types of meat and veggies such as bay scallops, calamari, and snow peas -Is about $10 for a single bowl -Has thicker, sweeter tasting sauces that have to be mixed in after the food is cooked (Otherwise they burn due to the sugar content).  With YC's, the sauces can be directly ladled onto your bowl and are cooked with the meat and vegetables. -Offers alcoholic beverages, and has a cheap happy hour (Which I have yet to try) -Does not have any free range soup or soft serve with your meal.  Drinks are provided by your server, rather than a free range soda fountain. -Servers bring your bowl to your table, rather than waiting at the counter -Does not offer you any waxed paper to push your meat/vegetables into the bowl so you can maximize on bowl space  Since the price is the same no matter what you get, I loaded up on seafood, getting a mix of marinated fish, shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  I got some veggies, 2 spoons of spice mixture, and a mix of szechuan, Khanzu, and ginger-citrus sauce.  While the combination tasted good itself, the thinner cuts of seafood ended up being done faster than the larger cuts.  As a result, the scallops and calamari tasted tough and overcooked while the shrimp was cooked just right.    Service was friendly and attentive.  While I do like the bigger selection of items to choose from, I like the thinner, less sugary sauces at YC's and the bigger bowls.  It's a tough call, but I would say, if you want more seafood and higher quality meat in general, go with Genghis, but the better deal will be at YC's."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The server was nice, but not very efficient. If you want a better alternative to this same style of food try out YC's. Genghis Grill not only doesn't taste as good as YC's, but the portions are smaller and you are required to have a server you must tip. Overall YC's is the better bang for your buck and tastes quite a bit better."}
{"text":"This place was bomb . Our servers were very helpful instructing us on how to build our bowl. I like that they ask about allergies ,it's a great precaution of them to take. They specialize in Mongolian stir fry. This place is around ten dollars for a medium sized bowl BUT you can pile as much as you want ontop! I will be back !"}
{"text":"Today my family and I went to this place to have lunch. We got sat down and then waited for 10 to 15 minutes for at least someone to come and get us drinks and present us the menu and what it is good there. Also there were 2 other families that came after us and they got sat down and they got their orders taken before us. The frustrating thing was that all the servers looked and knew that we were there but didn't bother to come and serve us or even ask us what are we doing there. We wanted to try it and see how it is so it was our first time there and for sure the last. The worst customer service ever and worst first impression! I would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty and there are several options to satisfy everyone. Not many Mongolian bbq's have fresh meats and seafood to add to your bowl but this restaurant does. Even though you go through the line and customize your dish yourself, the servers were still very on top of refills and making sure everything was going well. A little on the pricey side, but well worth it. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This place is great and lots of variety of veggies, meat and spices. Good vibe with music and the full bar. Good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great place! Here's the walk-through!  1. Wait to be seated, and when seated, wait for your waiter/waitress to come take your drink order.  2. Go up to the line and pick what size bowl you want.  3. Fill it with all the best fixings (overtime, you'll strategically start stacking more in the sides and empty spaces of your bowl, as well as seasoning like a freakin chef)  4. Pick your sauce (or 2)   5. Now the guy's gonna cook up everything you picked with you're choice of rice or noodle  6. The waiter/waitress will bring over your bowl when they are finished.  7.   Foods here! Gotta go!"}
{"text":"Good place if looking for a build your own stir fry, quality of everything is not top shelve but decent for price. Wait staff is friendly and helpful being there for first time they took time to explain how everything works. Food comes out quick. Wouldn't take first date here but definitely a place to check out if already married or been together for awhile or just hanging with the boyz and/or girlz."}
{"text":"I must admit I only ate here once during a connection flight from Atlanta back home to Sacramento CA. I had a chicken teriyaki bowl and the chicken was over cooked and did not taste good at all. Also, for $11 I would think they would at least give you a bit more rice. I would recommend you try any of the many other food sources at this airport.   By the way I am a level 6 reviewer on TripAdvisor (RevfromCA) with 180 reviews including 75 restaurant reviews in many different cities. I provide honest objective reviews both positive and negative."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I went there today and found the sign down and the doors locked. In my opinion, the beginning of the end was when they made the menu changes and reduced the items in the buffet. It was never the same after that.  Original review: I have been eating lunch here weekly for the past year. They recently did some remodeling and changed the menu and the bowl-building procedure. Before these changes, I would have given them a solid '5\" rating. Now they earn a \"3\".  Here's my gripes with the new format: 1. They now have an attendant that offers to fill your bowl for you. He/she needs to get lost. I'm a big boy and can build my own meal. 2. They no longer have artificial krab meat and have seemingly reduced the choices of meats and vegetables. Bring them back. 3. The sneeze guard over the food is too low and too deep. I have fairly long arms and just about have to stick my head beneath the glass to reach the back row. Was this built for dwarfs or something?  Here's what I like about this location: 1. The staff is excellent and service is usually always good. 2. It's clean. 3. Buy 10 bowls and you get one free.  I have noticed that it's less busy now than it was before the changes were made. These changes seem like solutions in search of a problem. It wasn't broken before, why did you try to fix it?  On the other hand, I ate at one in Dallas a few weeks ago and it was set up the same way, but they still had the krab meat. The location at Tempe Marketplace is still the way the Chandler location was before they \"fixed\" it. I'd go there, but it's too far for lunch, and that location gets really packed. Hmmm...see a pattern here?  I will still eat here on a weekly basis, unless they try to \"improve\" it more to the point of it being a hassle to eat there. It is a little pricey, but you control your own portion size, so fill the bowl wisely. The food is very good, I just wish they hadn't made so many changes."}
{"text":"Wendy was a GREAT server. Super sweet! Love coming to eat here with their variety of selections to chooses from when building your own bowl. Now, my clumsy fiancé accidentally spilled my drink & the hostess Breonna instead of acknowledging  it & helping us out with finding out server to alert someone about the spill, she just looked at it and continued on with her business. Not cool (I've been hostessing for 5 years & I know better ). My fiancé went to get the server himself. Thank you Wendy for you awesome service & thank you genghis for the great food!"}
{"text":"Food is great.. Love I can totally stuff my bowl with as much meat as I can.. the kids are already addicted and ready to come back again.. staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"So I ate in a similar place in San Diego.... Concept was the same I got the large bowl. Noodles beef and chicken.... It was nice, interesting concept, not cheap and the overall was ok....  If I'll be back in the neighborhood maybe I'll stop in again"}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place for lunch today. I was there during lunch time so they were very busy. It took 20mins just to get our bowls. Our waitress was very nice. We ordered the potstickers as our appetizer which was very delicious. The waitress did come by our table & many others to apologize for the long wait & offered us dessert at no charge. We skipped on dessert but they did take off our appetizer instead. The seating arrangements is very uncomfortable especially when it's lunchtime & crowded!! All in all we will be bad but not for lunch!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Greatest concept!   Its fresh and you can put more or less of food you want and you can see them cooking your food instead of it being closed off not knowing whats going on back there!  Everyone working there is kind and upbeat and are always on top of things.    I cannot tell you enough to come and try this place! Its fun."}
{"text":"Man, talk about an express rental of food, if you know what I mean.  I think this place is a little gimmicky and the food is just so so."}
{"text":"Extremely clean and efficient and the food was pretty good, though the bowl to put items in seems pretty small to me - I always get a bit of anxiety over how to maximize the bowl space but the ingredients are high quality and fresh and I like the little menu cards you can select from to create your bowl - I did meat version of a peanut curry tofu dish on the card, just used the same spices and sauce and it cam out great and I like that you can replace the rice or pasta or noodles with sliced cabbage.   When my team from work does a team builder this seems to be the place we pick because everyone can get what they like so for group outings with lots of variation in what people want, this place is great.   I can say I wish a place like this was on Mill avenue - it would make some nice variation in the food there and I chose three stars because hey, solid meal and if I was at the mall, I would definitely consider it as an option but I'm not a huge fan of malls. In other words, a solid average performer relative to all the other food option - if you've never had it before, worth a try."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Genghis last week and I was impressed. I have been to other Mongolian type places and this one is pretty much like the others. They give you a bowl that you choose ingredients from a bar and then you choose a sauce to go with it (like BBQ sauce, soy sauce, etc).  I filled up the bowl with lots of fresh veggies and tofu and gave it to the cook and went back to my table. The server brought it out a few minutes later. At first, it didn't look like a whole lot of food, but looks are deceiving. The bowl is actually pretty big and it was about 3/4 full. I was thoroughly full by the time I ate the last bite.   The waitstaff were friendly and helpful. Genghis is a bit expensive for a workday lunch. I paid for myself and one other person and we both had sodas. With tip, the bill was a little over $30. But they do have a rewards program where you get a free meal after 10 points (purchases), so I now have 2 points on the card they started last week. Their website also states you can get a free meal on your birthday, so you can at least try it for free. Even though it's a bit pricey, I love the concept and the food."}
{"text":"I love this place. When I'm craving for a healthy and delicious food, I drive out of my way just to eat there. Nice, clean and affordable. Would come back and refer to everybody."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to review the Genghis Grill because I really don't know what to say.  The concept is a solid one - I was a fan of BD's when they were here, but that could be because the cooks were so awesome. Plus, you could go back again and again.  At Genghis Grill, however, it reminds me more of a cafeteria than the open and fun atmosphere that hasn't been around here since BD's left. Can you tell that I miss BD's?  So you go through the line and start piling things on. If you screw up, you're stuck. Unless you go for the \"endless bowl\" (or whatever the call it), for a slight upcharge. To make matters a bit worse, the smallish bowl they give you for your plate is a bit on the tiny size, so don't screw up.  Here, the endless option is probably better - because you have a pretty good option of screwing up the flavors. If you think you might, then order off the menu instead."}
{"text":"Redemption?: After a 1 Star Review, has Genghis improved? With family in from Nebraska who wanted Mongolian BBQ it was time to find out. And after my 1st review of this place brought me a LOT of flak, private messages, and even some hate messages, I was like I'm going to wait to do a 2nd review. But that time is now and here it is. (I edited / added to this review, critics can go read the additional comments at the bottom.)  We went in for lunch on a Friday and I stayed quiet acting like I had never been there before as the person with me had not been there. We were seated promptly and given our super tiny little dog bowl for our meat choices and the hamster sized water cup for our sauces and listened to the whole spiel. Then we got dragged up to the counter and was having the process of bowl building explained when we got rushed through it as another horde of people started to come through.   It's still a pain in the rear to reach the food offerings to build your bowl with, the calimari and high end meats are gone, the spices are lame as I said before, and the black and brown goo sauce choices are still there. The same slow griller process is also in place, and yes they still use the absolutely asinine cards with the bowls to keep track of things. ( BD's does it so much better! ) The person I was with kept comparing it to HuHot in Lincoln, NE and she said out loud that this process sucked.   The food we got was ok. I ignored the griller recommendations and went with brown rice. Brown rice is hard to mess up, and it provides some food stability. (It's that Misti Y influence at work again.)  It's one item that usually won't suck. It was a good choice as this time the food was not as bad as last time.  But after I got tired of using the chopsticks I went to unwrap one of the cheapest food service mass produced forks in history only to find it's DIRTY! SCREECHING HALT IN PROGRESS, oh no Boo-Boo, we don't do dirty utensils. You will bring me another one like right freakin now! 4 min later a new fork arrives and I eat the rest of my lukewarm bowl. Across the table she barely eats about 1/4 of her bowl. Now keep in mind she's not inexperienced at Mongolian BBQ, she's ate it in 6 states, multiple different places too, and for her to only eat 1/4 of her bowl...ugh. I ask for her opinion, and she's nice and says it's \"ok\". Then I ask about how they compare to BD's and she's like this place sucks compared to them. Enough said. So after getting one more offer to buy an overpriced dessert we get our check. With an 18% tip it's almost $29 for 2 people to have lunch. Choking back that I just got seriously ripped off feeling I signed the check and headed for the door.   I did tell the staff that things have improved (Hey, they didn't spill something at the table this time so I was being honest!) But 45 min later I began to get sick. Did you know that from Pecos and Sunset to Sunset and I-515 there are 4 Terribles locations with bathrooms? I can now give reviews on 2 out of those 4 thanks to Genghis Grill's food. What's worse is when 2 people have urgent needs to use the same bathrooms. They need bigger restroom facilities that can handle more than 1 person at a time. There's also a great CVS pharmacy close to the Fox 5 studios on Sunset that sells Imodium tablets that kept our Friday from being an ode to Charmin type day.   I'm sorry but 1 Star is where this crappy place stays, and it gets bumped to my Call the Health Department list as my stomach still hurts almost 24 hours later.  Edit:  1: I know how to SERIOUSLY stack. And I still feel the bowls are way too small compared to their competitors offerings.  2: The sauces suck, period. I will mix my own sauces, I don't need someone to do it for me. And as for the product they've dumped out there for people to use, I can get better stuff at Vons off the shelf.  3: Pricing even with sales tax variations is still higher when compared with Denver, Kansas City, and Minneapolis. How do I know? I just got off the phone after calling and asking and comparing it against the receipt I have in my hand.  4: If the Clark County Health Dept wasn't in such disarray of late I'd walk in a complaint in person on Monday since I'll be downtown. Might just do it anyway. An inspection would do this place some good. Buying Imodium after the fact should NOT be part of my lunch time costs. People can squawk all they want but restaurant food should not make multiple people sick after it's consumed. And there's not a critic on here that should question that.   I take these reviews with the utmost seriousness as I learned from Chef Gio at Old School Pizzeria that these reviews have impact. These reviews can make or even break a business. I don't write 1 star reviews for spite, I simply call it as I experience it."}
{"text":"4 stars for a good selection of meats and veggies. Lose 1 star because all sauces are sweet. That's right, even the sauces that have two flame symbols next to them are a little sweet and if there's anything I hate in my food, it's the sweet sauces.  If you are anything like me, then just add the chili sauce they have by the serving counter where you take your raw assembly to give to the grill. The other option is to add the roasted tomato sauce.  Service is alright. I have never been to this place and not found it busy. Even on Sunday night at 8pm this place is full! definitely says a lot huh? Either that or the fact that they are the only good Mongolian BBQ in the Charlotte area.  PS: Their garlic citrus edamame is awesome, as is their brownie. Also, if you get your food for take out, you get a free drink."}
{"text":"Love the restaurant but sometimes hate seating. I feel like I'm right next to the other table. I like how they give bowl options now. Food bar is clean. There is always someone cleaning up. Lots of options. I always get udon noodles. Don't forget to ask for eggs!"}
{"text":"Awesome place... the food is awesome, drink specials all day and the staff do a great job. When my friends come into town, we always make this a spot for dinner and some drinks!  If you don't like the food, I'm sorry but you made your own bowl- its your fault!!"}
{"text":"A bunch of friends got together and headed off to Tempe Marketplace for the Gloriana concert. We were all hungry and my wife saw the \"Happy Hour\" sign so we all went into Genghis Grill.  There was no one at the front counter so we had to wait a few minutes for someone to help us. I have to say the food smelled great. We went to the line to build our orders. My wife asked one of the employees preparing the meals, which one of the sauces had pineapple juice in them. His response was that he did not know for sure, but he did not think that any had pineapple juice in them. In other words he was just guessing. If my wife has pineapple juice, someone needs to call 911. I tried to explain to the employee, that knowing for sure was really important. We finally got him to go in the back and get the ingredient list for the sauces. The one specifically she was asking about has pineapple juice in it. Things could have gotten bad really fast had she ingested that sauce.  I hate to write a review like this, the food was really good, the service was really bad.   I liked the food so much that even with the bad service, i wanted to buy some gift cards for gifts, I waited and waited for the cards, then when I got the acting manager to sell me the cards, he told me that they have a promotion, if you buy a $25 gift card, you get a $5 card for free, I thought that was a nice bonus. Then he told me that I would need to come back tomorrow and talk to a Manger, because he did not have access to those cards.   The servers had no direction in what they were doing, the place was way understaffed, which made for a less than great dining experience. I learned as I was leaving, that the management was all at a wedding and that they did not think it was going to be a busy night...They thought wrong.  Shame on the management for doing that to the servers.   In closing I have to say the food was really good, the service was really bad. Talking to a few of my friends, they had the same experience there, where it seemed like the place was understaffed.  I want to give it 2 stars, but I really thought the food tasted good."}
{"text":"I definitely like this place for a routine fast casual staple. It can use some improvement though. Fork was dirty. Lighting is too bright. Going a little dimmer would give a better ambience. Place was busy and food was fresh. Service was good. Their system and training showed. Sample spoons on the sauces were empty. Only had red cap soy sauce and not green."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with the wife. Treated Our son to lunch here for his Birthday and he loved it. Every time we go the food is excellent. You may have to try a couple of times to get the taste you want being that you fill your own bowl with protein, veggies, spices and sauce. I have found that once you get the spice and sauces to your taste your set. You can add an egg and some other items listed on the wall to include noodles and rice. There are some other add ons at the last station that can also be put in small containers and added to your liking. They also have pre printed picture recipe cards that can be used if your not filling adventures in making your own bowl. The server we had was very attentive and was willing to explain how things worked if we were first timers. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food here, my Carrie and I go here often.  They have gluten free rice noodles that taste just like regular noodles and the meat selection is really good and always fresh. Bill the manager is extremely friendly and has a great since of humor. We will be back Bill! Thank you for you service and hospitality!"}
{"text":"I would say that I enjoyed this place more than YCs, for a few reasons. I digged the table service, and our waiter was very nice and attentive. We were seated at a table, placed our drink orders, and then started making our meals. I had chicken and beef, loaded with lots of veggies and picked brown rice for my starch (I later found that you can pick multiple starches). One thing I liked that they had that YC's doesn't is the seasoning and the \"ready to go\" sauces (no worrying about recipes). I thought I seasoned it up pretty well, but I very much enjoyed the Dragon spice and sauces. After a few minutes, our meals were brought over and I thought my bowl was amazing. The only dings I have against the place is that aesthetically, they could manage to tidy up a bit (food was amiss/low in the food area, the table numbers are dingy). Otherwise it was really good and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Yes! This is what i've been looking for in Henderson. A bottomless mongolian grill joint containing multiple types of carbs and meats for your satiating preferences. when  you first arrive, you instantly notice the huge food bar to your left filled with steaks, beef, shrimp, marinated fish, PEPPERONIS, imitation crab, all sorts of goodies. FIll up your bowl and move onto the different seasonings (yellow curry was sickkness!), then onto veggies and your choice of sauces. So many sauces..it was hard to choose. Luckily it was bottomless so I tried 5 differnet ones with my 5 bowls!   my go-to combo: pepperoni, steak, mushrooms, bamboo, water chestnuts, with Dragon sauce and their special fried rice. Killer dish. I was literally in Mongolia.."}
{"text":"Really nice place service was great. Meat was fresh I don't think there was anything to complain about. Even when the line was long for the for to be cooked it still came out pretty fast. I would recommend this place to eat"}
{"text":"This is a great concept, build your own hibachi. However, I wish that they had a wall with suggestions on how to build classic Asian dishes. I think that would help a lot of guests. I think the lunch prices are more like dinner prices and I would never come for dinner- too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"My husband loves it!!! Staff very friendly. I wasn't very hungry so I got the salmon, it was amazing. Two thumbs up to my baby for a great pick."}
{"text":"I really dont see where these one and 2 star reviews are coming from. I eat out a lot due to my lifestyle and having no time to cook. Due to working out and keeping in shape I eat at Teriyaki Madness, Greens and Proteins and my favorite Genghis Grill. I come here 4 days a week and have never had any problems. Great A+service, I'm always welcomed once I come in, staff is always helpful and the General Manager Reagan is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. She goes above and beyond to make sure you have an enjoyable experience each time you visit. Its hard to find good healthy food on the go because this country has fast food places at every corner and the pricest are cheap. Normally trying to eat healthy cost you a lot of money. So instead of going to a fast food place and getting a fatting meal and a soda for $6-$7.00 why not come here a get a healthy meal and an unsweetned ice tea for a few dollars more. Where else in the valley can you go where you can put as much meat on your bowl as you can with no weight limit? I can get enough meat on one regular size bowl (there is a strategy to it) and I can get two feeling meals out of it.  There are plenty of meats to choose from, a lot of seasonings, vegetables are always fresh, plenty of sauces to choose from and at the end you can choose your starch.  It takes me about 4 minutes to complete my bowl and 15 minutes for them to cook it before I'm on my way to work. Teriyaki Madness is good but you can get burned out on it because its cooked the same way.  Teriyaki Madness used to be generous with their meet but as they expanded and are known there starting to get stingy. With Genghis Grill you control how your bowl is. If your on a low sodium diet you control the amount of seasoning you can put in it. If your tired of a sauce, there are plenty of others to try from so I never get burned out from eating there. I already have 10 free bowls. 80% of being fit is what your eating. You can work out all day but if your diet is wrong you wont see results. Life is fast paced nowadays and if you got kids at practice and your wife or husband works as well as you its hard to cook everyday. This is a great option if you live life on the go like me."}
{"text":"Genghis grill rocks. If you like YCs then you will love this place. I prefer it because they have larger bowls, the meats aren't frozen and their selection is better. I so like the fact that hey have predetermined recipes that you can follow on some cards before you enter the line."}
{"text":"The 1st time I came here I hated it. It probably had to do with the fact that I got noodles w/teriyaki which is pretty much disgusting lol. This time around I got brown rice with chicken and broccoli and the house sauce. AMAZING! Would def come back again"}
{"text":"The waiter talking too fast :), I missed what she said (I am kinda slow today ^-^).  I ordered no.6, the tasted was great.  I also ordered ice tea and a cheesecake. Total amount was $20.  The services was fast and very friendly.  The atmosphere was great for hangout with friends since they have a nice bar there."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was pregnant, and I felt sick afterwards. Not sure if it was because of the food or the baby. Second time I came, I didn't leave feeling much better. Not nauseous, just not happy. The place is just sub par. The meat looked disgusting just sitting there in an ice bath, all coagulated together. The veggies were fresh, but the sauce station was so old and worn that I couldn't read any of the descriptions. Our server was minimally helpful; most of the time she was hanging out with some friends in a booth, and came over once to ask if we wanted water refills. Wait, she didn't ask me if I wanted a water refill, just my husband. Overall I was really let down and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The best Mongolian cuisine I've ever had I would eat this every single day. I ordered a make your own bowl with some chicken veggies and spicy garlic sauce. The roasted grill taste on every bite makes you wanna eat more and more they have a wide range of drinks to choose from, we ordered basil lemonade which is really good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for mongolian grill. I love their sauces the meat options are really good. The chicken dumplings are juicy and delicious. This is a must visit place if you love grilled food with asian blend. The prices are affordable too the staff here is so damn friendly. Keep rocking guys"}
{"text":"Visited August 2015:  \"Lifelong Customer\"  I have been coming to this establishment with my family since they first opened over 5 years ago. I am a loyal customer who has brought several friends, family members, and co workers there - who themselves are now loyal customers. I have their rewards card, and I probably have received over 30 free bowls (including my birthday bowl) because of how much I enjoy eating at this place. You get to make your bowl the way you want to, with fresh products - or have one of the pre-made dishes off the menu. I encourage you to get the medium bowl, since I think the small bowl is geared more towards children. You go down the line and pick out your proteins, then seasoning, veggies, and sauces. Finally you let the cooks know which starch you would like to have with your meal, and then you can pick up crunchies or cut up peanuts to put on the final product. You then sit down at your table, and wait for the staff to bring you your meal. They have appetizers and desserts to choose from, along with a vast amount of alcoholic drinks to choose. The staff is friendly and outgoing people, who will assist with your experience if it is your first time. Mike, who has been there since the place opened, remembers us every time we come in and always finds time to say hello to us. The only criticism I have to give, are the tongs for the food. When they first opened the tongs they had were great! Now, you have to try to pick up the food multiple times because they either don't pick up the food, the food falls off, or you can't get enough of the item on the tongs. This small thing, can boggle down the lines."}
{"text":"First off, this place is good. The selection of meats are really unequivocally vast. You get get sausage, pepperoni, pork, beef, chicken, and for dinner scallops. You are prompted to start with a protein after getting your bowl from the hostess stand. From the meat stand you proceed to dry seasoning which I did not really notice in the end product because the final sauces you add to your separate sauce cup are so viscous they overpower the dry seasoning. After seasoning you pick your vegetable, of which there are many. They the afore mentioned sauces a next. There are again, many from which to choose, all made in house. They were good but they are very thick and slightly off putting. With your bowl piled high you walk up to the counter and select your starch, rice in several iterations and 2 noodle choices. I like that they add to starch so you do not have to cram it in the bowl. Now the service. The hostess as someone mentioned was slow to appear and when she did she walked up to us with her head down and was writing something for like 2 mins before she acknowledged us, it was rather rude. We did have a good waitress though, how hard is bringing drinks? Also, the wait staff were rather chatty with each other and their giggling was sort of annoying and it seemed to take precedence over my food waiting at the counter being delivered to me.  In fact I was with someone and they and already gotten their food and were full into eating before my meal came, though it was ready.  They do have a full bar and many different specialty drinks on their menu. I can for lunch though and I have no need to be bagged in the middle of the day. Bottom line, the place was good and I will be back to see if they improve or deteriorate. Hopefully they will be better next time and I can give a better rating because they have a potential for a great rating."}
{"text":"This location just opened. One of the best Mongolian places I've ever eaten in. Hoping they put one closer to me."}
{"text":"I've been gunnin' for a Mongolian stir fry in the QC for a long, long time. I have great memories of heading to a similar style of restaurant when I was a wee girl. So, it wasn't too much of a surprise that I was jacked when I read that we now have a Genghis Grill in Charlotte!   The Good:  As others have said, you really make your own meal here. As in - if you don't love the components, well, it's your fault. There are a ton of topping options - proteins, starches, veggies, sauces, spices, etc. The instruction from the staff is definitely on point and helpful as you navigate the bowl bar. Overall, I liked my bowl and was able to make it super spicy with plenty of dragon sauce, jalapeno and red pepper. My mouth was on fuego. Plus, prices are pretty affordable at $8.99 for a lunch bowl and $9.99 for a dinner bowl. The kiddos will love this place.   The Meh:  It's a chainy chain, so I didn't really find much character in the restaurant. While the service was great, I really didn't have a desire to stay any longer than I needed to. Plus, the quality of the proteins was definitely lacking for me...the shrimp are incredibly tiny and quite a bit of my steak was a bit grisly.   Would I head back to Genghis Gril? Surely. You have the opportunity to make a healthy meal that's quick and pretty affordable. It's absolutely A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"I'm so glad businesses are going up near where I live, instead of places a bit far out. I like Genghis Grill especially because I can choose exactly what I want in my bowl and I don't have to say I want this, but hold that.  I decide!    When you're seated, empty bowls are brought to you and you fill it up with whatever you want- meats vegetables, spices and you pour sauce into the little cup, take it to the counter, tell them what kind of starch you want, then wait for your concoction.  I must say, my creation was good the first time around.     Our server was very helpful in telling my family how the whole process works, and he took them to the line to show them.  He also checked back with us several times, to see how we liked the food.  One night we went for my mom's birthday and he gathered other fellow employees and they sang to her.    They have mini machines at the table where you can order from. They can be helpful as they eliminate the wait time of the server standing there while you decide what drink to order, or whatever the case may be.  When you're ready, enter it on the tablet.  When I came with a friend, drinks were ordered and our guy still came out to see who ordered what and to check ID's.    I only have one objection.  While going through the line, food droppings sit on the counter and on the floor.  And not like there's a bit here a bit there, it's all the way down the line.  I guess that's to be expected, but if the employees did a clean sweep every now and then, the counter would look so much better.  All in all, I love eating here, and I've only been here twice.  The price isn't bad at all, considering that you can pile high for cheap.  My meal was less than $11 and I went home satisfied.  You can get endless for a few bucks more.  Lunch price isn't a break in the bank either.  If you get a Genghis card and rack up points, you get a free bowl on the 10th point (bowl).  Also, on your birthday you get a free bowl!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Clean, fast and much more organized than the BD's I went to.  Wish they had as many sauces as BDs, but I'll take clean and organized instead!  Delicious food though!  And I loved the recipes they had - for those less creative :)"}
{"text":"Went with my fiancé & mother tonight for the first time. They gave me someone else's order & my mother's order received the wrong 'harvest'. Had to remake it, honestly wasn't that good. Prices are fair and the people were really kind & even gave us 20% off for the mix up. Good environment. Maybe I just picked out the wrong sauce/combination of food (chicken, shrimp, onion, egg, udon, and dragon sauce) and that's why I didn't really care for it. Maybe I was expecting a Chinese cuisine type of meal (yes, it's Mongolian food). Wouldn't recommend. Plenty of other places to visit in Tempe Marketplace. Again, *extremely* nice waitresses and managers, just not a fan of the food & selection.  Tip for if the business if they read this review: remove the glass panel at the food line. Horrible design to make customer reach under to grab a food item. Really awkward & uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This was our first experience here and the food was great. Our server Mia was great and very helpful. I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Great establishment to eat.  Atmosphere with sports on is a bit relaxing and OK for kids of all ages.  Friendly staff available to assist if you are undecided on how to prepare your bowl."}
{"text":"This place was a pit stop for me- but it was so good! I got the chicken teriyaki bowl. I'd definitely come back.   Fast service and yummy food!"}
{"text":"I still haven't found a Mongolian bbq place as good as the one in my hometown, but Genghis comes pretty close. They have delicious food to choose from, great drink prices (especially during happy hour), and spot-on service. Not much bad to say about this place other than that I'm partial to \"my\" Mongolian bbq place.  A while ago, the restaurant next door closed down (like literally in the middle of a day) so they still had food out and everything. Something happened with the drains since they weren't able to fully clean up before shutting down and the whole place smelled like the worst possible odor you can imagine. Unfortunately for Genghis, the smell seeped into their restaurant which totally, totally sucked. I almost walked out when I walked in one day until the server explained all this to me from the start-to-finish and then apologized as if he created the stench himself. For that service, we endured the smell and stayed because we wanted to support the business. The plumbing has since been corrected and the place smells better than ever. It's also fun to bring my dog here and eat at the outside tables. Come here over Bar Louie."}
{"text":"I like it. Ive only been here a few times. I find it weird however how the meats and veggies change up enough to notice . I would think it would be more consistent. But, if it's anything like how I cook at home- I get what's a good price and hodgepodge it together.. just like here. Can't fault them too much for that. ( except when you really want something that they now don't have this time) . Service has always been pretty good.. food is cooked good."}
{"text":"if you're in charlotte reading this review, this place is good.  check it out if you've never been to a mongolian grill or even if you have.  i myself have been to a couple mongolian grills and none of them have been bad.  this one is no exception.  if you're in atlanta reading this review, it's like the real chow baby, but they make it a little easier to not mess up your stir fry.  i thought mine would taste horrible because i mixed almost every protein in my bowl, but it actually ended up tasting pretty good although a bit over seasoned.  trust them when they say a dash of seasoning goes a long way.    like previous reviews said, if you mess it up, it's yo fault.  the bowls, although small, ended up to be a decent portion.   our server was very friendly to my group and explained everything since it was our first time there."}
{"text":"Best Mongolian BBQ in the valley! Fast service, great selection of meats & veggies, wide array of sauces & spices... awesome flavor."}
{"text":"This is a really awesome stir fry cuisine. Sizes to choose from small, medium, large. Whatever you can pack in the bowl, they will cook!   I ordered a large size and wish I got a medium! Great selection of meat to choose from and marinated well. I chose the steak, chicken and shrimps. Sides was mushroom, onions and others but I forgot. But there's tons of veggies to choose! For sauce I poured the garlic.  After you fill your bowl, you drop off your entry to the chef and they cook it right there! You could either wait there and watch their magic or sit at your table and the server will bring it to you.   Food came out magnificent and every taste was mesmerizing   Thank you!"}
{"text":"There really were no redeeming features in my just half finished Mongo Beef. I will return to change this review to one star if I end up with food poisoning."}
{"text":"They recently made some changes and it stinks. They have different and less options than last time. The sizes and prices of their bowls are kind of a joke. Not sure if I will return. The staff is overwhelming."}
{"text":"Omg, this is my favorite place to eat! The staff is always friendly, the food is always great and the prices are totally reasonable. There are so many options to eat and the customization is great. I love it here."}
{"text":"The food is ok but not for the price? This is a glorified Buffett. A family of four was 100.00 with a few appetizers. So over priced and no quality and service that warrant the expense!"}
{"text":"We usually love coming here but the last few times the service has been TERRIBLE! The restaurant was not even close to being half full but it took a hostess forever to come seat us; even after seeing us standing there. Our waiter only came by to bring water and when we asked to place orders at the bar they promised to come back but didn't until we were halfway through our meal. Also, they were out of a few of the meat selections and their drink specials. We couldn't get what we wanted to eat or drink and the experience wasn't even saved by good service... Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love the Genghis Grill in downtown Chattanooga, so I was excited when I saw this GG open at CLT.  I am happy to share the food was excellent. The line was long but moved fast. A five minute wait for my food, which wasn't bad considering the line. The employes were typical of the airport and it was priced like it was in an airport. Those two issues cost the review one star. Worth the stop if you are passing through CLT."}
{"text":"We arrived to a loud, chaotic layout. There was no clear path or sign and no hostess awaiting us. We chose the most obvious looking route, into the barbecue line, and picked our ingredients. Got to the end and were informed by our baffled chef that we needed a \"card\" for them to fry our food. Went to find a server but none would make contact with us, so we seated ourselves, assuming a server would come by (as some restaurants do). One did but entered into another baffled conversation in which we were basically told we were the ones in the wrong, and told what to do \"next time.\" Our actual server was nice and tried to excuse the place but he was too little too late. The only reason this place gets more than one star is for the food, which was fresh and pretty good. Otherwise it's too loud, confusing and the customer service SUCKS. Never returning."}
{"text":"We came here because we were really hungry and it wasn't too bad. It was one of our random trips up to Phoenix one day and we decided to eat here. The food was good and with $4 fireball bombs, can't complain!"}
{"text":"Love the food here but the price is ridiculous.   First things first, the food is extremely delicious. They have a wonderful variety of options and I never EVER leave dissatisfied with what I ate.   My only issue with them is the price; which is the only reason they don't get 5 stars. That being said, you can take food home with you so as long as you pile your dish sky high (my recommendation, use the sugar snap peas to form a wall giving you a few extra inches of piling room ) then you can get your money's worth.   And like I said, the food is delicious so really that's all that matters."}
{"text":"Good option for airport food.  Freshly made and has veggie options.  Also the ability to get brown rice.  Overall, filling and potentially healthy if you order wisely!   One of my favorite quick options when flying through Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love Mongolian BBQ, I was stationed in Asia when I was a young GI right out of college and have been eating this style of food my whole life. As far as the food and choice this place is the best I have ever seen. The selection of different types of meat, veggies, and sauces is just amazing. The quality if also as good as you will find. The only reason I did not rate this restaurant as a 5 star was they are not totally self service. Most of the places I have been with this type of cooking, you don't have to deal with a food server.. Here they seat you and someone takes your drink order and then brings you your food... I much prefer to have someone give me a glass, i can get my own drink and bring my own food to the table..  That is how it is done at most other Mongolian places I have been to.. I then just tip the people who cook the food... Just a preference.. My wife and I retired and we eat out more often than we eat at home so self service places are attactive to us... I don't mind tipping when I go some place and get all the traditional service..."}
{"text":"Gloppy sugary sweet flavorless anglofied sauces.  Tiny bowl for your food choices.  Intrusive server. Fresh ingredients.  The perfect Mongolian BBQ for Republicans."}
{"text":"Genghis has been one of my favorite go to restaurants at Tempe marketplace! One thing for sure is service is always superb, they make it an have too go to experience! Always ask if you been here if you haven't they'll throw down the spill! But once you get seated, you go up and pick your size bowls, 3 bowls small, medium and of course large! First time here oh say? I'd stick with the medium you'll either eat it all or have some leftovers! You pick your protein from sea food too meat meat! A column of vegetables also; and then seasoning! They also have side cards in case you can't pick out your own or create your recipe! Last but not least is the sauce from basic soy to a yummy dragon sauce! Which is amazing! Then pick your side aka, base carb like rice to even spaghetti noodles I think they also do lettuce wraps too so it's evolving as time goes by! Drink specials are awesome and they have a great happy hour, all very daily as well! Hungry from shopping or trying to escape the heat? Come here! Well, stay hungry Arizona !"}
{"text":"In the United States, Mongolian is synonymous with putting uncooked food in a small bowl and handing it over to be cooked on a large metal grill by chefs with huge wooden sticks.  At Genghis Grill, you are directed to have a seat and your food is brought to you.  What separates Genghis from other Mongolian restaurants is that they use this extra time to fully cook the meet and vegetables.  No need for thin strips of meat, and the vegetables are not crunchy.  Cooking the food helps a lot.  I also like the wide variety of meets including marinated steak and sausage.  Yes, sausage.  Adding an egg is a good choice, and I usually favor the peanut sauce with some extra kick.  In the end, it is really your fault if your meal doesn't come out right, and you are allowed a few practice runs to perfect your choices."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, and I was happy with what I had experienced.  Daniel had suggested it on the way to the Yelp event, and I liked the idea.  This place is located within the Tempe Marketplace Mall, so you won't actually see it from the road.  When entering, we were immediately greeted by the hostess.  She asked how many were in our party, and I told her two.  We were seated at a table, and asked if we had been here before.  Daniel had, but I had not.  I am familiar with this sort of dining, but had not been to this particular chain or location to experience what the place was about.  Basically, the jist of the joint is that you prepare your own meal.  There is a buffet style setup with lots of raw ingredients.  Meat, steak, pork, chicken, etc.  There's also loads of veggies and spices to choose from, to make your meal complete.  Take as much (or as little) as you like.  What I really liked was that they had reciepe ideas on the wall.  this made it easier for someone like me who couldn't think of anything in particular that I felt like making at the moment.  After you assemble your dish, you give it to the guys at the grill.  In turn, they give you a number, and put it on your table.  When your food is done being cooked, they walk it out to your table.  I liked that! No waiting by the grill, especially with it being so hot here.  I don't remember what Daniel had, but I had a beef and veggie dish that I made myself.  Tasty!    I would gladly return to this location again, and enjoy thier dining."}
{"text":"The only two things I miss about living in Michigan are BD's and Flat Top Grill.  I have literally rerouted airplane trips to have layovers in Chicago and Dallas so I can run out for a bowl.  Thus I watched the construction of Genghis with baited breath and high fived the lord for putting it two blocks from my office.  For years, I got stirfry once or twice a week because one bowl lasts two meals (am I right, pro-stackers?!)  Sadly, it's been eight trips so far, and the place is still not quite right.  I will absolutely keep eating there, but I always tell them honestly when they ask how my visit was, and many of the frequent irritations seem easy to fix!  (Watch out, TL;DR coming!)   THE BAD:  1) The habitual mistake I see every time is how the grillers dump the bowl and walk away.  I have even watched my pile sit still until it's time to sauce.  The word \"stir\" in \"stir fry\" should have been on Day One of training, guys.  Move that shit around!   Aside from the performance aspect (which is supposed to be one of the selling features), it prevents food from burning itself to the grill, and flaking charred remains into my meal.  When you watch them plate your bowl, you see a thin black layer of food lost to the grill, which wouldn't happen if they kept the piles moving.  I cringe to think how much wasted food is hauled out of that trap every night.  At BD's the guys rotate around the grill, so every pile gets flipped a few times.  There's a fine line between leaving it long enough to brown, and ignoring it so long it burns.  I lose half my crab every meal because it's left behind, blackened to the grill.  STIR!  MORE!  2) The guys who designed the buffet dimensions suck and the store owners should demand a do-over.  I imagine it's hard to think of every body size and ability, but the back row is so far behind the sneeze guard, I literally have to bend over and press my shoulder against the rail to stretch far enough.  For a while, they had a guy back there handing you the unreachables.  Considering how much shrimp I eat, I sympathize with their tactics ... but the message is clear when they have two rows of fish and the shrimp in back: They don't want you eating it!  I've gone at 4:00 and the scallops weren't out yet, so I can only imagine they somehow create an additional barrier.  Portion it out in plastic cups if the cost is killing you!  3) The cooks need improvement for reading the card instructions, something time will fix I hope.  I have asked for rice on the side, and it was mixed.  I have asked for an extra sauce cup and they told me I have to ask my server.  I walked five feet over and grabbed it myself from the station.  I have asked for my bowl to go, and they handed me a plate.  I have gotten a bowl to go, and they handed me a To Go box sitting on a plate.  I ended up walking over to the server station and bagging it myself.  Rookie moves, guys!  4) The appetizers are disappointing.  Twice I have ordered appetizers and they arrived after my bowl.  The citrus salt is too strong on the edamame.  The lettuce gets soggy when you pour all the meat over all the lettuce.  Some lettuce should be on the side so it can stay crisp -- pouring hot meat and sauce on lettuce equals limp cooked lettuce for the last half of the dish!   THE GOOD:  1) After a few rough trips, we wrote an email listing our problems and the manager invited us back for a free meal.  Gold star response!  2) I pay $9 for Teriyaki Madness, and can get Genghis To Go in the same time for a dollar more -- but I get all the \"Surf N Turf\" I can stack.  I eat half for lunch and the rest for dinner.  Anyone who complains about the size of the bowls isn't doing it right and/or expecting the business to lose money.  I punish the Station Buffets like anyone else, but stand-alone restaurant owners walk a razor thin margin.  There's plenty of food and money for us all to go home happy and full, folks.  3) My friends and I have gotten diabolical with the game of stacking over the years.  My personal best involves tucking snowpeas along the rim to create a retaining wall, and pressing the meat down with a broccoli floret (don't use the tongs, because someone might be allergic to something else touched in your bowl.)  We are easily amused.  ;-)"}
{"text":"this place is hit & miss every time we go there, don't go there and expect good service you will most likely get ok service at best...The food selection is great as long as they don't burn it, we are a family of three and sure enough EVERY TIME we have gone there one of us has gotten our food burned by the cooks, then it's a real pain in the arse to get your food re-done and by then the rest of the family is done and waiting..Bottom line, usually bad service along with 1 out of 3 meals being burt..=1 star..I will say this if you ignore the waitress and they don't burn your food it's a pretty good meal.."}
{"text":"The first time I tried a place like this was in san diego and I fell in love!   I love this place because you basically pick your own ingredients. The only downfall could be that you suck at picking ingredients and your food sucks. While you can complain at other places, here you can't blame anyone but yourself! Im sure the servers are happy about that!   they have soooooo much variety! from chicken to scallops, to calamari, etc! and all sorts of spices and veggies and sauces! i feel like a little kid in here!   so you get to pick your veggies, meats, sauces, spices, and at the cook bar they ask you what starches you want. I like noodles! and they cook it for you and bring it to you. Mine always ends up tasting amazing! I go all GENGHIS KHAN ON MY FOOD! haha..anyway, All the flavors are a kick in the mouth...in a good way!...(is there a good way to get kicked in the mouth?!)..you get my point!   the servers are super nice, and the place is super cheap!  They have awesome drink specials too! monday-Thursday, all day happy hour!"}
{"text":"Small or medium is plenty! Stack your bowl high with veggies rice and noodles will be added at the stir fry station"}
{"text":"Good quality of food, and very kid friendly. A little pricey, which explains why it isn't 5 stars. Great fire show! My son loved it when they cleaned the grill. The portions are somewhat smaller than I expected. To be quite honest, the whole process of getting your food is a little confusing. I don't like the idea of the public being able to touch their own raw meat for some reason. It grosses me out. All the same....it's adequate but not fantastic."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone is complaining.   The food is good for the price.  Especially when you do the unlimited for $4 more.  We had excellent service.   The wait staff was more than attentive then some other places we've been.  It's not fancy but food and service were above par."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Just remember , if you say spicy, you will get spicy. I like spicy and whoa buddy..... hot hot hot. Owned and operated by Indians . Drinks are crazy expensive, 19$ for a double jack."}
{"text":"Our server Michelle was fantastic!  We sat outside and enjoyed a beautiful Phoenix evening.  The food is fantastic - this was our second night in a row as we enjoyed it so much.  The staff is fast and super helpful - they helped me sample a number of different sauce choices.  The food was well flavored and came out to our table in just a few minutes.  All it all, made for a great evening with family!"}
{"text":"Used to be a four star place before the portion sizes went down and they removed the shrimp. No shrimp at all?!?!? That was my favorite part. The owner said their prices went up so they removed it. I understand business but at the same time keeping customers happy and customer retention is important as well. I will find a new place to go when I crave Mongolian BBQ."}
{"text":"New ownership...   Good job!  That was a lot of food... Service was great. Had a great time. Good atmosphere. I will definitely come back.  Awesome food and great service... DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place & got a belated bday bowl. The food is great. Sometimes the service is hit or miss. Like of your explaining the new concept to someone at the bar area let people who are hungry & waiting behind who know how to go in front."}
{"text":"Interesting to go to a Chain style grill place.  Price - 5 star - For lunch, you can fill up your little saucer for 8.99 and then add your choice of starch.  Makes for a nice lunch meal   For 2.00 more, you can have a second bowl or more.  Ambiance - 5 star - Clean organized, plenty of seating.  Roomy too.    Food - 2 star - All very nice in presentation,  well cooled.  However, everything was very hard to get to, the plexiglass protection from your face to the food is so short that anyone over 5'10 has to bend over and stretch to get to the food.  Overall, very inconvenient, but large choice of meats, vege and sauces.  Cooked - 2 star This is very uninspired.  IT is grilled on the big hot grill like all Mongolian Grills are.  However, the taste just comes out \"okay\"  It isn't to die for, and is quite like having cafeteria food.  Decent, filling, and not bad.  Just not great.  Service - 4 star - everyone is very well trained, cordial, pleasant and it would be a five star, but there is not a lot to \"serve\" other than drinks, hot sauce and the bill.    Overall, a nice clean and decent place to dine.  Just not really asian food. It is same as going to Panda Express for Chinese, or Taco Bell for \"mexican\".  Good for American Style, just not really authentic.  They have a nice bar, that is a plus for you Thirsty Dogs!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before...but had driven past is various times and decided to stop and see what it was all about. The concept is pretty simple, you purchase a bowl (out of three sizes) and fill it up with all the protein and vegetables you want. I chose the medium size and it came with the option of picking two sides. With the large you can pick 3 and with the small 1. The medium was more than enough and I had plenty of food to take home. The server was very nice and she told us to fill up the bowl as much as we wanted. This is good to know because at first the bowls can seem small but they actually fit a lot of food.   You do have to season your food and pick the sauces you want in your stir fry. Each seasoning has a small teaspoon and I really recommend you don't go overboard here. It is easy to over season and end up with a salty mess. I also recommend you go slow on all of the sauces. It is also easy to pick too many sauces and then end up with a soupy over seasoned meal.   I do have to say that my and the hubbies meals came out really nice. We were pleased with all of the options. We also tried their Nutella dessert which was pretty good. The crispy friend wonton filled with Nutella and drizzled with honey were delicious. The ice cream per se was ok.   My only recommendation is just to be careful with your sauces and spices. It would be nice for the restaurant to have sort of a recommended guide for its costumers detailing which sauces pair well with others and how to season meats. Otherwise the service was excellent and the food came promptly. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Not your topical Mongolian  BBQ place :/  Service is horrible , staff doesn't explain how the build your own bowl works  Meat quality is horrible the mall is way better   Very disappointing :("}
{"text":"I revisited this location and my experience was so much better.  Greeted right away, received service at counter and was asked if needed help etc.   service is so much better  I highly recommend this location now.  I will go back for sure!   Now I have two to choose from, depending on what part of the valley I am in"}
{"text":"Oh my god!!! This place is so freakin good!! I was scared at first because you completely build your own bowl. You choose the meats, the seasoning, the sauces, and noodles or rice. So it's all up to you. But if you are not sure about your ability on combining different flavor together than they have little recipe cards that show you what to put in your bowl. Mine food was so good I was honestly really surprised and I loved it! The only thing is that the service was okay, not great. But really really good food!"}
{"text":"I struggled a lot on whether to give this a 3 or a 4. Honestly, I'm not happy with my decision and I'm thinking it may deserve a 3. This place is new to me, but I'm no stranger to \"Mongolian BBQ\" as I've been a long-time fan of YC's. Obviously I'm going to compare the two.   I liked that they had fresh meat, but it was a little fatty and since they use thicker chunks as opposed to shaved and frozen, it takes longer to cook your food. They seem to stack up orders on the hot disc. It definitely lacks the flair you get when eating at YC's, but the novelty of that wears off after a few times anyway. Plus, I know it's wrong, but I prefer the frozen shaved meats to these chunks. It's just different though - I wouldn't say frozen is better, just that I prefer it.   I would even go so far as to say I preferred a lot of their fixin's outside of the meat. They had a better selection of spicy powders and sauces than YC's, and this place definitely caters to the spicy food lover more. They also had better vegetables. I should also mention they have a better selection of meats including two types of beef and even shrimp and scallops. Even your choices of noodles and rice was more extensive. Come to think of it, they really beat the shit out of YC's hands down in the available food department.  And taste? Well, it was delicious I must say. Of course, I assembled the dish, so if it wasn't any good I have to accept at least part of the blame if not all. If I had to compare, I'd say YC's is very reliable and good consistantly because I tend to always create roughly the same dish. GG's I could see having a much broader range of flavors and experiences.   The ambiance was okay for a strip-mall restaurant. It was kinda kitschy, but charming enough and fairly comfy. They had attention to detail. I think YC's (depending on which one you go to) is a \"no frills\" sort of place compared to this. They were piping in some good contemporary alternative music as well... for a minute, I thought someone had lifted my ipod.  Service was attentive, but odd since this is a \"get your own food\" kind of place... They also have menus which is strange considering you basically put your own dish together and since the server explains the process again to you in detail. I felt a bit like a child being explained something so simple and obvious, but my girlfriend had a confused look on her face, so maybe it's a good thing they do that. Regulars probably just get escorted over to the line.  I think my main gripe with it was the tiny bowl they gave me for the fixin's... but then again, you aren't putting noodles or rice in there like you do at YC's - they add that as they cook it for you. So I suppose the portions are comparable. Then there's the price. A little high perhaps - maybe higher than YC's (I know they used to be 5 bucks for a lunch bowl). But you do get a lot for your money if you know how to pack the food in the bowl.   So I guess I was right to give it a 4 instead of a 3... turns out I really liked it. I think this would be a real treat for someone who hasn't had Mongolian BBQ before. I consider this to be a great alternative to YC's... Impressive."}
{"text":"Very neat concept where you pick how large of a bowl you would like and then you go up to a buffet style of ingredients which you pick yourself.  Then, you pick your meats, vegetables, seasonings and sauces. Then you take this to the cooking area where you choose which starch(es) you want (rices, noodles, etc) and whether or not you want an egg added. Then you go sit down. Once your food is cooked, they bring it to you. There is a huge variety to create your own stir-fry invention. But the way you ordered your food here was WAY different than most other Mongolian BBQs."}
{"text":"Best Asian stir fry I've ever had at a fast food joint. Delicious and piping hot... Cooked fresh, not steamed in a pan all day. Yumm"}
{"text":"I've been to many Mongolian style restaurants and this setup is the worst.  It was my first time here and the waitress explained how to fill out a card?  Why don't I get to just go and grab my food like every other Mongolian style restaurant? I picked my bowl based on price, $10, not wanting to spend much and was shocked when they gave me a bowl not fit for my five year old.  Already upset I reluctantly started filling my bowl with meats and then moved on to the veggies.  When I realized the veggie selection wasn't the best I went back to the meats only to be stopped by the staff and told that it'd be an extra $4 to go back?!!! Isn't this supposed to be all I can fit in one bowl?  Nope, when I asked for the bigger bowl she said it would still be an additional $4 to go back and pointed at a sign that is behind the counter, written in small type and half way down the line.  Can I get some warning?  It was at this point I was disgruntled and looking at my sad little portion I decided to hand my bowl to the chef and I walked out.  I don't plan on trying them out again any time soon."}
{"text":"Create your own mountain of a bowl filled with your favorite meats and veggies, then have it cooked to perfection by their Grill Masters!  This Mongolian style restaurant has over 80 delicious ingredients to choose from.  First you'll pick a bowl size, small, regular, or large.  I find it absolutely impossible to eat an entire large bowl, and rarely will I get through a regular.  If you are absolutely famished, I think you'd be fine with a regular if you pile it high!  You'll have the opportunity to pack the bowl with whatever meats and veggies you prefer.  My personal favorite is as follows: Sliced beef, chicken, and crab meat.  I'll add some pineapples, green peppers, tomatoes, and baby corn.  Then I'll add more meat to the top to create a pyramid of goodness.  As for the sauces, there are a plethora to choose from.  I elect to do 1/2 sweet n sour and 1/2 island teriyaki.  Once you drop your bowl and sauce at the counter to be prepared, you'll circle what sides you want.  I personally like 2x Udon Noodles and brown rice.  You can choose from tortillas, fried rice, steamed rice, etc.  Once you've completed your order they will prepare it there right before your eyes.  The prices vary from lunch to dinner.  Lunch prices are $9 small, $10 regular, $13 large Monday-Friday 11am-4pm. If you'd like to come for dinner after 4pm, prices are $10 small, $12.25 regular, and $15 large.  This place is located on the complete opposite side of town from me, but I always try to stop by when I'm in the area.  Not only do they have great food, but a full bar as will with signature cocktails, beer and wine."}
{"text":"Great service!  I made a bowl and informed the manager that the shrimp tasted \"off.\"  I was fine eating around it, but the manager insisted I make myself a new bowl, which I did.  The second bowl I made was just OK too.  Even with the variety of meats, spices, vegetables, sauces, and sides, I've never been completely satisfied with any of the bowls made here.  Next time I'm going to stick to my gut and get an appetizer that I know I will enjoy if I'm forced to meet others here because I certainly won't go alone knowing I won't be satisfied with the food.  There is supposed to be a full bar, but they had no ingredients for any signature drinks, couldn't do a simple rum and Coke, and basically had sake as the only alcohol available."}
{"text":"Ughhh..  For the love of all things holy, do not go here.   I'm a huge fan of all foods Asian, so of course I came here with my friend to try it since I recieved a coupon. I wish I went to Arbys instead.  This is far from being good.  I mean really? Tortia chips as one of the carbs? This place is just a joke. Its like walking into a brighly lit apple bees but with none of the flavor.   You cant pay me to go back here."}
{"text":"This place was okay but not what I expected. Family & I were craving Mongolian grill & this place was the closest on the west side. For the self serve: Their poultry was thawed & it gave a mixture of raw meat odor, it just smelled weird. By looking at it looks fresh & it is. I think any raw meat like steak, chicken, pork, ect. shouldn't be side by side. Someone can easily scoop a mixture from one raw meat to another using the same utensil which is not good. Also the comparison to a large bowl to a regular bowl the portion is the same & I asked the server what's the difference, does the large get more noodle or rice versus regular size? The server's reply was yes, I told her mine's didn't look that way & all she said was that why it's always best to just get a size smaller. To me that's not consistent with the portion on what's large & regular size."}
{"text":"I meet my daughter for lunch Tempe Marketing and she had one of those noodle cravings. She wanted to go to GG and I haven't been there before so I'm always willing to try new places  Walked in and they greeted us right away. Got a table right by the grill. Interesting place. They have a bar area and a grill area but nothing about the place stood out to me.   So I found out that they have little tags at the table that you bring to the grill. So you basically give them you name and your bowl size then get your bowl and fill it with meat and veggies. Fill it as high as possible. So many possibilities. They give you a small cup for your sauce that you pick out too. Then it's off to the grill and since I got a medium bowl you get two choices of your carbs. Noodles, rice, and even tortillas. I just basically got brown rice. Anyways, when it's done they bring your bowl to your table.   So the bowl was pretty good. Fresh veggies and fresh meat. It's a pretty good concept. Enjoyed the food and the relaxing environment. Wouldn't mine going back. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Food is good!!! It's like a YCs type deal, but I actually prefer YCs a little more, as you can add more noodles and things to the bowl, as compared to Genghis, which limits what you can put in the bowl. Then they will trim down the amount of starch they add  for how much you have added to your bowl. Overall good experience and decent food."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 3 because it's one of those places that wasn't terrible but we probably wouldn't end up coming back. We went on a Friday night so it was a bit busy and took a bit for them to cook our food. I was kinda disappointed with the sauces and the variety. The prices were kinda steep too for the food. We did have pretty good service, nothing to complain about. The food is cooked to order which is nice and the waitress did ask if we had allergies which was great! Lots of veggies to add and lots of different proteins."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here! Mongolian food quick with your own taste preference :)"}
{"text":"Pricey, but pretty damn good.  They would have had 5 stars, but inexplicably there was neither garlic or sesame oil available. In fact, all the sauces had some sort of sugar element, and were very \"ketchupy\".  Do not want.  They have a rewards program that sounds pretty good, but I won't be going there often given the distance.  I'd return with the person I went with, though. :)"}
{"text":"Service is not good. The food tastes flat. The ambiance is somewhere between a sports bar, a mongolian BBQ and a cheap chinese restaurant. The drinks are not good and prepared by non-professional barmen and barwomen. I had to ask for the bowls to be replaced because they were dirty and the waitress didn't see anything wrong!!! For the same money I can have better food across the street at Pei-Wei."}
{"text":"This is my Husband's favorite spot. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. Genghis is a Mongolian grill. They give you a bowl to stack all your items in. You start with your protein: they have chicken, turkey, pork, beef, sausage, ham, shrimp, fish, crab, scallops, and pepperoni. Then you spice your protein. They have all kinds of spices. Everything from salt to ginger. Next you pick your veggies and wow do they have veggies!! All the things sprouts, peppers, potatoes, tofu, onions, eggs, mushrooms..ect. Now it's time to pick your sauce. They again have several to pick from: they have a honey soy, their signature sauce called 3G sauce, a spice sauce called Dragon sauce. It also tells you the heat level on them. Now you go over to the grill where the chef will ask you to pick your starch. They have brown rice, white rice, fried rice, udon noodles (my favorite) , spiral noodles and tortillas. Now they take ALL your things and cook it on a huge flat top grill! You can stand and watch or sit at your table. If one bowl just isn't enough for you they also have a bottomless option for a few bucks more.  They have a full bar or you can get your own drinks at their super cool coke freestyle machines. You can mix any flavor and soda you want. Plus unlimited refills.   Genghis also has appetizers and desserts, but I've never tried them. I always see people order the pot stickers.   A cool thing about Genghis is they have table side ordering system. Each table has a little computer where you can place your order and pay! It's very convenient.   Their staff is nice and friendly, but if your in a hurry this is not the place to go. It can take some time to get your bowl if there are a lot of people there. Overall no real complaints. The food is yummy and it's fun to pick all the things that go in your meal. Also, very healthy and a great place for kids. On Tuesday's kids eat free with an adult. Plus, on your birthday you get a birthday bowl for free if you join their email club."}
{"text":"This restaurant is filthy. I could feel the grease on the walls and the furniture when we got there, but I wanted to stick it out because the reviews weren't bad and I wanted to try something new in our area. I took two bites of my meal and noticed something crawling on the window sill next to our table, it turned out to be a cricket (per my husband), but my appetite was immediately gone. I packed up my child, asked my hubby to take care of the bill and waited in the car. I'll never return and I discourage others from going until this place is thoroughly cleaned and inspected."}
{"text":"We passed by last night and turned around. First time here. We use to go to lai lai's. So this place was clean and their food looked really fresh. I got the large bowl. Wife got the regular. I have to say it was VERY good. I enjoyed every bite. The only reason I give it 4 stars, is it was 15.00 for a large bowl. I think that's a little pricey for a bowl of noodles with meat. But I will go back."}
{"text":"Food is good and their happy looks good with good prices..but the service needs  improvement.."}
{"text":"I have been to Genghis Grill a few times already and I really like this place, I always tell my friends about it too. This place is good, but it should be great. The concept is easy.. You build your own bowl with your choice of protein, veggies, sauce/seasonings and starches. My bowls always taste really good so as far as that it's perfect. What I'm not 100% on is the service. The staff is always very nice, but I feel like I am being suffocated by them. When you are first seated you wait for your server to come and I feel like they just talk sooo much and explain what I already know, this bugs since they ask if you know how the build your own bowl works. I feel they need more choices for appetizers, specially since they have 120 drink choices. The food line always looks like a mess.. I understand it's self serve, but that's why it should be kept cleaner. There's plenty of ingredient choices so every time you go there you can make a totally different bowl. Once you complete your bowl it only takes a few minutes for it to be cooked. I like that they are done quick, I just don't like that the bowls are not brought out together. I hate eating before everyone has their food and I had to wait a couple of minutes before I could have a bite since we were missing one bowl. I do believe all the plates should be brought out together. On this last visit out service visited our table about 4 times.. I feel that's a bit much since she wasn't removing anything from our table or filling up drinks (self serve as well). I will keep recommending this place to everyone because the food really is great, you'll enjoy your creation. As far as everything else, there really will be flaws."}
{"text":"Recently went here on a lunch break. The food was amazing. Strongly recommend the noodles. I didn't realize it's closer to the parking lot by the lake then by rio. Could have saved me a couple minutes with the heat.   Noddles is the way to go for sure. It was fast and easy and tasty! The service was good also. I strongly recommend it. It's a more casual and fast version of YC's. My favorite part is you drop off your bowl, then go to your table they bring it when it's cooked!"}
{"text":"Been here a ton in the past, but it had been a while since I'd stopped in. We ordered to go and sat in the bar area waiting. The general manager was making drinks and chatting with us. I was super impressed by his level of service and that of his staff. Would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys stir-fry."}
{"text":"Last night a few of us went to Genghis after work to have some Mongolian BBQ and drinks.  It was Friday, a long week and we deserved it!  If you look at my last update, you'll know that this place has a lot to choose from.  This time, I decided to get the bottomless dinner bowl for $13.99.  I tried getting the Udon noodles on my first bowl and wasn't impressed.  The noodles didn't take much of the flavor I hoped it would.  Got the fried rice in my second bowl and I was a happy camper.  Love putting pork and shrimp in there, plus a lot of texture, like bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and other crunchy veggies.    At the end of my meal, I had to try the molten lava cake with ice cream for $4.99.  It was a light and fluffy cake, filled with fudge.  If you get this dessert, I would recommend adding the ice cream in to bring another flavor to the chocolate.  All in all, it was was great dessert and a great way to end my dinner there.  Last night was a wonderful time.  Great company, good food and great service!  Janean was our server and she was super attentive and funny as heck.  I know that the table next to us didn't have a great time with her, but I never judge the service by someone else.  Everyone has their own levels of service expectations and mine includes forgiveness.  With Janean though, there were no red flags and I truly appreciated her calling us by our first names at all times.  I have a great appreciation for this place and I know that you will too!  Be sure to stop by and get some Mongolian goodness!"}
{"text":"We came to Genghis Grill for dinner and when my bowl was brought to the table it had a big black hair in it. I told the manager on duty right away and he didn't offer me to make a new bowl or even apologize.  He took the bowl back to the take out section, took out the hair, and then dumped the remnants of the bowl into a new one. Disgusting. I cannot eat here anymore without having to worry that there is hair in my food."}
{"text":"Great for a fast, healthy lunch. You're in and out in a pan flash. I would never go for dinner. We also only go when we have coupons now, buy 1 get 2nd 1/2 off.   While the picking of meats/proteins, vegetables and spices can be intimidating at first (it is even for a cook like me) there are CARDS with suggested recipe combinations.   Sadly, I've been here 6 times now, and not one person ever picks out the recipe suggestion cards but then hop on to sites like Yelp to complain.   Okay for a fast meal where you want to control your sugars, salts and ingredients --- Definitely not romantic and I would not bring a business client.   Good for limited purposes. (And yes the crab meat is artificial crab)"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, when my sister and brother in law suggested this place after a DBack baseball game, I was hesitant. It's a bar assembly with different meats, chicken, veggies, sauces and spices. You make up your own bowl and the cooks will cook it for you. It doesn't take long, our bowls were brought out shortly. and OMG it was to die for! I savored every drop of that bowl. It was better than I thought it was going to be.  if you're not sure what you want, they have cards that suggesting you what you can mix up. Looks like a nice place to bring a date to eat and grab a drink as well. Customer service was decent.  I will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"It's basically a stir-fry place. You pick your goods then sides (noodles or rice) & they stir fry it.  The food is great. If you're vegan, you can eat here by customizing your order. There's plenty of veggie options and sauce options. If you like meat then pile it on. My only dislike about this place is the soda machine is self-serve. And the sun shines through the door & blinds you at lunch."}
{"text":"The noodles are AMAZING. This place stole my heart. I almost cried of pure happiness. So delicious. I crave it every second of the day now. A+++. I was so impressed, it's my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Third time must be the charm, right? Service and food were totally awesome. Menu has been updated (still minor issues with dessert availability, but the server handled it so, so very well) and the food remains what brings me back.  This trip I had the significant other with me (on crutches) and the staff really went out of their way to help him navigate the physical plant, and the menu, and the whole go-on-line-with-a-bowl-while-using-crutches thing. When they discovered he was a police officer and a casualty of Hurricane Sandy, well; you'd have thought the red carpet came out. But we got the feeling that they take care of *every* handicapped person who came there, so not to worry if your injury isn't as dramatic!  Most importantly, the food was truly wonderful. Watching my guy experience Genghis for the first time reminded me what I love here. And the price? We've spent far more for far less!  Please keep this version of the staff. Please??? Because now I get to do my best/worst AHHHHnold impression- I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. I love the fact that you can choose your own ingredients which are really good quality and they have soda machines that are really fun because you can make different combinations. We even got the tuxedo bomb dessert and it was really good!"}
{"text":"We love the food and go only on Tuesday or Sunday when server Julia is working. She is the best. So nice and friendly. Wish she worked more days."}
{"text":"Ordered the regular bowl for the first time (always been the small one so far) and WOW, it's a lot of food.  I can't imagine what the large would be like.  The bathroom left a lot to be desired.  I was the first one there shortly after they opened and one stall was already out of TP and both toilets have weak flushing power.  The room had an off-smell and although I was the first one to use it, I couldn't help but feel so dirty afterwards.  Highly recommend going to the restroom before coming here."}
{"text":"Out of the choices, this restaurant seemed to offer a bigger variety of entrees with lots of vegetables than the other restaurants. A better choice than the others if your health conscious, maybe a little more sodium than what you should consume but that can be washed away with some water throughout the day. The vegetable were cooked very well, nice crisp green beans. They offer brown rice as a base our you can probably ask for double veggie. The food was delicious, not as salty as I thought based on previous reviews. I don't understand why folks compare it to the actual restaurant which I've had experienced before. The restaurant style is not necessary as an airport option, this passport edition add the same theme with similar food items but you don't have the option to build your own bowl which is understanding being the location and the amount of available options nearby. Making it exactly like the real restaurant may eventually fail or cost too much to run. Cooking style is the same, on the big round flat top grill. I'm assuming is Mongolian style, I don't know, I'm not Mongolian. The clerks were professional, attentive, and have a keen eye. He spotted my military ID when I pulled out my wallet and applied the military discount which is very generous and very appreciated. The portion is just right, who wants to stuff themselves before a flight. You get about a little over 2 cups of food. I requested the to-go option to get the reusable plastic container so that I can prep some heathy meals during my business trip. I forgot to bring some. Aside from the sushi place in the food court, this place would be my pick. I have a thing about trying not to consume raw foods before a flight in case I get sick during the flight, not a good choice but I guess if you're a sushi fanatic, have at it. Well I hope you have a safe flight and I hope you like my review."}
{"text":"I still love this place but I feel everything is always wet. The clean bowls are wet. The trays are wet. The floor. It's just strange to me. Quality is still good and food tastes great. Make what you like and like what you eat."}
{"text":"My first time being to this kind of restaurant and I have to say I wasn't displeased nor was I impressed. If you want to get your moneys worth you literally have to stack the food above and beyond the bowls rim. Kinda a lot of choices which makes it difficult to make a good combination if your new to this kind of thing. However all in all I have to say my experience was good. Service was great. Just remember to get your monies worth."}
{"text":"I still hate this place but am cursed as my husband loves it..I tried to hide the fact they opened one in Matthews but can't ooooh noooooooo I"}
{"text":"I love this place! Jesse is the best bartender/ server!!! Food is always fresh and cooked perfectly. Its too bad the one in tucson closed :-("}
{"text":"I work down in Chandler near Hong Kong gourmet boofay. I can go in there for lunch and for about the same price as I paid as GG I can get Mongolian stir fry, sushi and Chinese buffet...and honestly, the Mongolian stir fry at HKG would kick GG's ass all over the place.   I had some pork, some beef, some veggies and some different sauces with fried rice. The pork was tough, crappy cuts full of grissle (sp?). The beef was just ok...still tough however. All in all, it just wasn't that great...I did not enjoy my bowl. My daughter and son both enjoyed thiers but it just wasn't happening for me. Pricing aside, the Mongolian stir fry at other places has been much better.  Now add in no drink refills and indifferent service and 2 stars is just about right. I don't see myself returning to GG."}
{"text":"This place has become a new favorite of mine at Tempe Marketplace. A friend recommended this restaurant to us one night before the movies so we decided to give it a try. As I walked in, I looked at the bowls and chuckled. \"There's no way that's gonna fill me up\" I thought. Boy was I surprised.   So the general idea here is you get a bowl, walk down the line and throw in all the ingredients you want. From beef to chicken to a few fishes and the other white meat, there's no way they won't have what you want. Add some veggies at the next station then down to the sauce station. Here is where the fun is as you try and mix and match sauces to make something that tastes good. Next stop is the cook who asks what you want your concoction mixed with (rice, fried rice, udon noodles, a couple others I can't remember.) Five minutes later your eating what hopefully tastes good and the size is not disappointing.  I will forever be a fan of this joint as it gives me the ability to choose what I want in my food down to the detail.  The staff isn't as attentive when it's busy meaning empty drinks for a bit, but they are friendly and helpful when they are around."}
{"text":"Closed."}
{"text":"2* because the food is actually pretty decent. The service, however is abysmal. This is the second trip in a row that there's been a \"mix-up in the kitchen\" that resulted in either mine or my wife's bowls coming out 15 minutes after the other."}
{"text":"Big disappointment & an even bigger ripoff -  $68 for limp, overlooked edamame, 4 medium sized bowls & 4 drinks is ridiculous. Especially when the food you end up with isn't even that good. I've been to many good Mongolian BBQ places & unfortunately, this wasn't one.  My hubby & youngest son had been there before & liked it, my oldest son & I had not.  1st disappointment was that they were out of shrimp. I was trying to build a variation of their firecracker bowl which has shrimp, calamari & scallops in it so that was annoying. The guy just said they weren't carrying shrimp anymore. Really? Maybe they shouldn't have shrimp listed on their menu as an option then.  Something else to note, not a disappointment, but def another annoyance.. It was extremely difficult to reach the food bins in the very back row bc the sneeze guards are so low. I'm not short nor do I have short arms.. 5'10\" & I'm sure I looked ridiculous trying to reach the veggies that I wanted lol Last but not least, I had to completely remake my bowl bc the 1st one was inedible. Well, actually my hubby remade it bc at that point, I was over the whole \"experience\" & just wanted to leave. The calamari rings were closer to rubber bands & the whole thing just tasted \"off\" Bad seafood-not good!"}
{"text":"It's a mongolian grill, you know the drill...  Get a bowl, fill it to overflowing with every meat and veg they have (except maybe pineapple and pepperoni), douse it with a sauce, some ginger or garlic and hope for the best.  Honestly it always tastes different but it always tastes good and it comes out hotter than the sun.  It's more than you could (or should?) eat in one sitting, so it's really two meals or one meal and a snack for later.  They cook it well and you know what you're getting.  It's kind of pricey, especially after drinks and dessert but ok if you get 2 meals out of it.  My daughter got the kids mac & cheese - it looked like it was from another planet.  The cheese was all crusty (not in a good way) and sliding off the noodles into the pools of grease.  It was cold and yet the crusty cheese was hot (again not in a good way).  We pointed it out to the staff and immediately they brought her another option - cheesy quesadilla (in a good way).  I'm not dying to return and I do love me some Mongolian!  I want a more authentic, less franchisey one maybe..."}
{"text":"Not as enjoyable  Had not visited in a while and decided to stop by for lunch. The experience wasn't poor, but wasn't as enjoyable in the past for three reasons:  (1) The food area was messy, with beef and chicken slices smeared on the bar where you select ingredient. We navigate our trays around the meet stains. (2) We would occasionally get the smell of bile or bad beer waft our way at our first table. (3) The bathroom was bad enough that the two people ahead of me stepped in, then backed right out with sour looks on their faces. I decided I could wait rather than risk any olfactory harm.  Maybe it was just an amazing party the night before that left things in less than stellar shape. The service was actually fine and the food was okay. It was just the cleanliness issues that served as a big turn-off.   Oh, and at $15+ per person on average, the bowls should be bigger..."}
{"text":"The service was fine, we had a nice waitress that kept our drinks full. For the price I thought it was a pretty small bowl, and it just seems like a game they are playing. You get this small silver cat dish and when they serve it ,it comes in a large red funky shaped bowl. As if no one can figure that out.   The fried rice looked ok, the noodles were disgusting. I should have refused to eat them as they made my stomach upset later in the day. Very, very greasy, sauces were sugery.  They have calories on the wall and I have a sneaking suspicion they are very misleading and the calorie count is probably without the carbs and sauces....  This place is run in a guise of hoping we don't notice we are being treated like knuckleheads sardined in for an 8.99 bowl of goo. The cat dish is what? to prompt you to what upgrade to a second bowl of goo?   Yes, the tables were small, there was 4 people in my party and I was afraid to move my elbow.  The bill was 45 bucks without tips. ( you get reminded to tip too via signs)... For that amount of money  you are better off going to the Great Greek On Warm Springs and you can eat off their family meal for a few days. By the way two people in the party were hungry later on in the day.. so after spending so much on lunch they weren't even full... seemed extra expensive on that note....     I was disappointed with the overall experience. It wasn't a total bust but I would not go back unless someone else wanted me to go. In short too much work and aggravation. Getting your own food, squeezing in and out of the tables, and too little of it for the price once you consider tax and tip."}
{"text":"So, I love this Place. We had a little mix up tonight and I somehow got someone else's bowl. The manager was so wonderful about it. He let me make another bowl and didn't charge me for dinner. I will be back again and again.."}
{"text":"Still the best Mongolian grill ok this side of town. Really need more gluten free options for sauces though, there's only 1 I think. Why does there need to be gluten in sauces anyway?"}
{"text":"This is one of the first, if not the first location in Charlotte.  I visited a long time ago when they first opened and also recently.  I had a good experience both times.  The staff is really friendly and willing to help and explain if there is something you're confused about.  They walk you right through it!  The buffet area was clean and organized.  There was someone behind it constantly refilling and there for questions at all times.  I went on  Sunday when the opened, so there wasn't too many people yet.  The line moved smoothly and I had a chance to fill my bowl extra high!  You have to do that, by the way, pack everything in, because when it cooks, it shrinks.    I ordered double udon noodles and my meal cam out lovely.  Would definitely recommend and come back.  What could go wrong with build you own bowl?"}
{"text":"OK. First of all, this is not actually Mongolian food. A number of years ago, some businessmen in Taiwan opened a Japanese-style stir fry joint and decided to invent a story about Genghis Khan's soldiers cooking meat and vegetables over their upturned shields. Historically inaccurate myth became fact for uneducated diners. Whatever, it's still an interesting concept. Real Mongolian food is noodles, dumplings, and hearty soups, usually with mutton and little else. At Genghis Grill, you choose from various meats and vegetables (including shrimp, not withstanding the fact that the capitol of Mongolia is nearly 1,000 miles from the ocean) and have them cooked on a grill for you. Service is kinda haphazard but the staff are all young and enthusiastic, and it was sort of like dining in a bus terminal with all of the activity and people coming and going. Recommended for lunch with a large group, definitely not for a quiet romantic evening."}
{"text":"It was ok. I got the Thai chicken bowl with white rice. It was a little spicy and tasted funny.  But it was edible. The rice was not that great.  But I had stomach issues later that evening.  Won't stop back in here."}
{"text":"Giving a 2nd update, and I have to downgrade again. And I would tell you not to even give this place a chance. Went here for a birthday; not by choice. Prices are rising for the bowls. Even with a water, you can't get a normal sized bowl and walk out for less than $15 (when adding in tip). At that price, you shouldn't be serving up frozen meat. Genghis Grill has slowly lost customers at this location and the lower food quality is why. I used to be a loyal patron 4 years ago but they cut corners on the food. Do not waste your time here unless you want to pay $15 for frozen chicken."}
{"text":"For a Mongolian style grill, Genghis Grill isn't bad but there are other formats which are much more flexible.   The chicken was alright but my wife's steak tips were tough. They were out of Teriyaki sauce which was disappointing but we made due with the Honey Soy. They have way too many syrupy sauces. Not very calorie conscious.   The server was very good.  He was attentive and friendly. He got a good tip.   For improvements, they need to serve the rice on the side so we control how much. I heard they also own BD's Mongolian BBQ. Yes or no, they need to convert to their format of doing it.  We'll be back since for the price it's a nice night out."}
{"text":"I have been going to Mongolian BBQ's for a long time.  While this is not the best it is better then the valleys other chain of Mongolian BBQ, YC's.  The selection of meats is great.  I also love that they have tortillas available.  The service and been just OK and this location seems a tight for space.  But we will be returning and enjoying it."}
{"text":"The food was great, as always.  The service was terribly slow tonight,  but I still give them 4 stars because they were very short staffed and the servers were doing everything could, and the manager was really great in dealing with it."}
{"text":"Do not go to this location! Horrible management and rewards program! I have been a Genghis Grill customer for the last five years. First I will say the food is fresh and I really enjoy the mongo BBQ sauce. It's spicy, but very tasty. Genghis is over-priced, so don't be shocked by the bill. Also, paying tip for someone that just brings you drinks is a little hard to justify. This location is no good! Today my table was numbered incorrectly and there was some confusion on delivering my tables bowls. Secondly, being a rewards member I received two emails offering me a two for $25 deal. The manager would not accept the email for the reason that it was only for their arrowhead location. Uh ok. So am I only a rewards member for one location? This is horrible service. After being a loyal customer I feel this deal should have been accepted. So I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Genghis Grill and I thought it was wonderful. Very casual, but great place if your looking for a quick meal. Also great if you're looking for a low carb meal out! Place was clean and they kept an eye on drink refills."}
{"text":"A knockoff of AJ's Mongolian at Metrocenter, only better protein varieties.  I liked the quality of the food, but they were busy and the staff was overwhelmed.   They couldn't keep on top of the crowd or the mess created by the crowd in the food line."}
{"text":"Great food great ambience. Had the build your own bowl. Great selection of meats and veggies and a variety of sauces to select from as well."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the word. The meal size and the price are to cry for  thank you for bring joy to my taste buds"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have tried so hard to like this restaurant.  The concept is cool, fill up a bowl with raw items of your choosing, add a sauce and then pick a starch.   Try as I might, I have yet to find a winning combination.  All of the sauces are so sweet, and while I normally like sweet things, they do not satisfy.  The service is adequate and the atmosphere is pleasant, but without liking the food, I am unlikely to return (unless others make me)."}
{"text":"Ok, I am not expecting much from airport food, but sorry, this is hardly edible.  It was so salty and greasy.  I usually don't order Asian food when at the airport, but I was craving rice some kind of bad, so I decided to go for it.  I took two bites and just couldn't eat it anymore.... Super expensive for really bad food."}
{"text":"Gross. Awful service. RUN AWAY!"}
{"text":"Great Mongolian food, fresh and quick.  Please make sure you try the kale & veggie potstickers...they were to die for and I probably could have eaten two orders by myself.  The food is plenty, I got the large bowl but I think medium/regular would have been enough since I couldn't finish my bowl.  The best part is choosing your own meat, veggies, and sauces...pretty cool."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but I've had two bad visits in a row so I'm done. Yesterday 2 out of the 4 people at my table got the wrong starch, one had a very long delay because they'd somehow lost his bowl, another had totally raw egg in their bowl and we all had trouble getting drinks refilled. The prior visit my husbands bowl was served to the table next to us but the gentleman recognized that it wasn't his and sent it away. It was eventually served to my husband although they did offer to let him make a new bowl. Honestly, no one wants to start over when everyone else at the table has their meal. It seems like once they upgraded the decor everything else went downhill. Nothing is quite as clean and tidy as it used to be and the ingredients aren't as fresh. I also was bothered to see the busser wiping chairs and tables with the same towel but I see that at a lot of places...yuck!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review because the new owner reached out to me right away and offered me a free meal. It was awesome this time and I really appreciate them wanting to make the situation right!"}
{"text":"Great place and good food.  Considering that you pick out the food that is being cooked of you don't like the food you  are the problem because you have picked out what is being cooked. I think some of the reviews on here are ridiculous. This place is great but have some common sense when choosing what you want for you bowl. I recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ingrediant are fresh and good.  Just like any Mongolian style bbq... it is what YOU make it.  It's in the Tempe Matketplace, so it's clean and service was friendly!"}
{"text":"I love Genghis Grill. I first tried it when I was in Texas. Unfortunately, there aren't any close to me, so we try to go to the one in Henderson when we're in Vegas. We went Sunday and once again, we weren't disappointed. Everything was delicious and the staff was friendly. I believe out server's name was Brett ( I apologize if that's wrong) he was very friendly and attentive. I love the fact that you can fill up your bowl with whatever YOU want. So for all the reviewers that complained about how the food tasted, you are the only one to blame. You get to pick everything in your meal all the way down to the sauce. And don't complain about not liking any of the sauces, they provide tasting spoons so u can try them before committing. Genghis Grill is great! Everyone should try it at least once!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time over the weekend.  It was fun and delicious.  The staff helped us through the process and there were suggestions on how to create specific dishes.  There were a lot of items to choose from for the bowls, from chicken and beef to scallops and pork.  There are also a lot of vegetable selections and at least 10 different sauces to choose from.  They have a huge assortment of soft drinks and a full bar as well.  Additionally they do have a couple appetizer selections to choose from and a limited dessert menu with a cheesecake and brownie selection, among other choices.  I had a small with fried rice and was satisfied.  I wish there had been less rice in the bowl so the veggie meat rice ratio was a little more balanced but overall a great dish.  Others in my party had the large and medium bowls.  Again, despite filling their meat and veggie dish to the brim, I still felt like their noodle to other stuff ratio was a little off balance.  All in all, a good experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"All the ceiling fans were set to max, the best part is that the lights in the restaurant are above the fans.  Great strobe light effect from the fans and lights.  Could not get over that part of the restaurant.  It was similar to a flickering light effect throughout the restaurant.   I was unsure of food safety after reading Ryan's review so with the light/ceiling fan issue I headed for the door."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great. It tasted very bland and fried rice wasn't good at all. I'm pretty sure it was made with parboiled or instant rice. I wouldn't eat here again. There are much better options in the airport."}
{"text":"I love that I can pick my own protein, seasonings, vegetables and starch, and a sauce and someone else cooks. What I don't like is that a small meal and I mean bordering on tiny cost me twelve dollars and some change. Yes it was super delicious. I had Korean Mariano's beef, with salt and garlic seasoning, zucchini, sprouts, mushrooms and snow peas with a pan Asian sauce on rice noodles. The combination was amazing. Regardless that I felt it was pricey I would go back again because it was really good."}
{"text":"I work in the food industry so I completely understand how much a bad review can hurt a business. I hate to contribute to it, but what happened on my last visit was completely unacceptable.  I came in on Tuesday and went thru the line, packed my bowl full of food that I knew were with in my dietary restrictions. I have a severe gluten intolerance, and I knew that genghis was good about listing ingredients and giving out special tickets based on dietary restrictions, which is what got me excited about going to eat there. when I got to the cooking station I told them about my intolerance and I got the special blue ticket making it know to the staff. as I was eating my food, (my base of which was white steamed rice) I kept pulling wheat noodle after  wheat noodle out of my mouth. I was very very upset. I told the waitress, without trying to be to rude but still trying to get my point across, she was really nice and went and told a manager, but I heard nothing after that. The manager never came over to me, and nothing was done about my food. I still had to pay 12 dollars for a meal that made me sick afterwards. Things like this can NOT happen if your goal is to make allergies a priority in the restaurant. I have no interest in coming back."}
{"text":"I had never done mongolian bbq before and I really enjoyed it !  You fill up bowls of frozen/uncooked meat and veggies and sauces and then they cook it for you on a giant wok or steam table thing and add rice or noodles .  The shredded beef  & the signature 3G sauce was the bomb!   I made mine way too spicy (my own fault for going crazy with the cayenne) but it was still so delicious!   & They had 16 oz shock top for like $4 which were tasty too   & our waiter Brett was so nice we loved him"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Genghis Grill and it was a unique experience. The place is bigger than I thought it was. You can either go up to the counter and build your own bowl, have them make your custom bowl, or choose a classic bowl. We wanted to make our own, but first ordered both appetizers: Garlic-Citrus Edamame and Chicken Potstickers. I thought the edamame was a little too firm for my liking and the seasoning was ok, but not amazing. The potstickers were fine but they were almost room temperature and the dipping sauce was cold, which I didn't like. And our water tasted like dirt! I'm not even exaggerating. I took one sip and that was it. My boyfriend agreed it was terrible. The cups looked dirty too. We promptly ordered a Coke and an iced tea using the cool little electronic tablet on the table. After the appetizers, we went up to make our entrees. There were several people in the line. I got the sliced beef with garlic, salt, and pepper, carrots, and pineapple. When I got toward the end, I realized the noodles were separate and did not have to fit in the metal bowl, so I decided to go back to the start of the line to add more meat and veggies. I got more of the same, plus a few green beans, broccoli, and mandarin oranges. I also got the Island Teriyaki sauce, an egg, and selected the udon noodles. When I got back to the table to wait for the food to be delivered, I noticed they had taken our tablet away... I was disappointed cuz I thought we would actually be able to pay with it. Boo. My boyfriend's food came several minutes before mine since he didn't go back like I did. I think it confused the workers that our food wasn't together. But once I got mine, it was pretty tasty. The beef tasted like hamburger meat, which I wasn't expecting, but I like hamburger so that's alright with me. Since it's stir fry, the green beans and broccoli were crunchier than I prefer, but they still tasted good in the sauce. I also tried a bite of my boyfriend's dish. He had chicken and the 3G sauce. It didn't have a lot of flavor because he made the mistake of putting the sauce in the bowl rather than in a separate cup, so a lot of it burned off during cooking. But the regular size was a good amount of food and I was full. I wish they had the option of doing two mini-bowls so I could try two different sauces and one w/ rice, one w/ noodles. That would be cool. I don't know if I will be back to try something different. Our server was very attentive, but it wasn't a cheap meal, and with the mishaps we encountered, I'm just not sure if it's worth it to return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat before a movie. Not bad on the price. Even held on to our food for us till our movie was over. Friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"My third or fourth visit here.  They were VERY busy today..  The whole grill was full and they had 10-12 more orders stacked up.  It is hard to complain about the food at a place like this..  You pick what you want so it is basically up to you to make it good.  That said.  I like YC's.  Yes, their meat is freeze dried, but the dishes seem more customizable..  Especially when it comes to the sauces.  I don't want pre-made ones laid out..  Give us all the ingredients, and a guide, and let us decide.  I'll be back because everyone at my work loves this place..  I don't think they've had YC's."}
{"text":"I am a fan. I thought the selection was nice, and the wait wasn't too bad, but when I went it had been open for a few weeks.   I can understand the dietary concerns for those with allergies or meat restrictions, because it is all cooked on one grill at the same time as other batches.   My one complaint would be to have it be more clearly stated on the menu that there are no free refills... I made my dish a little spicy, and so after 3 iced teas to quench my thirst, it became a little pricey."}
{"text":"I was really confused when I first walked in.  There was no menu and I didn't notice the price on the wall for the bowls.  When I got in line, I had no idea how they were going to charge me, by weight? certain ingredients? by gender? I didn't know. No one had explained it to me.  I found out later that you pay one flat price. I made it through the process fine, got my food and enjoyed it immensely, until I noticed that they did not put in one of my ingredients! They took out the pineapple from my bowl of ingredients that I handed them. Why?! What do they have against pineapples?  The waiter was very friendly, until he learned that I had a high value coupon. Then he practically ignored me the rest of the time.  That was fine, because I didn't really see the point of waiters at this restaurant anyway since they don't really need to take your order. Overall, the food was great, you get a lot for the price. Now that I know the process, I would come back again."}
{"text":"I will start by saying this is the best stir fry place I've found in the Valley - hands down.  After months of great food and \"par\" service - I had my first bad experience today.  It was disappointing but not tragic.  I will try again and make sure they aren't trending down.  I should have been a better \"Yelper\" and reviewed them for all the good experiences but felt compelled today.  They have always been a little stingy with the sauces.  They could use more adjustable sizes for that.    Service is always \"bleh\" here.  They have one redhead female who seems so flippant - it makes me whince we I walk in and she is there.  I am not sure why they have such attitude - we make our own bowls they just need to run it and keep the drinks refilled.  They get tipped on full ticket price - so I am not sure why all the sourpuss attitudes.   HOWEVER, we go back TIME AND TIME AGAIN because of the food.  It is a great place :)"}
{"text":"I love coming here! Always fresh food and such a large variety of meats and veggies. Staff is so so. Not the best but definitely not the worst. Definitely has room for improvement. Sadly, this is their only location. Wish they had a few around town.   They have lunch special from 11-5pm mon-Friday!!"}
{"text":"Unprepared for dinner rush. One person struggling to keep up with the raw bar. Didn't see the cards for combination suggestions until after I got in line. I don't know. But just not liking the vibe. Waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"I'm still kinda trying to understand what happened when I ate here. The overwhelming amount of options makes it nearly impossible for someone to create a cohesive enough flavor for it to taste good.  However, if you figure out what works here, I'm sure this can become a favorite.You can really load up on meets and veggies. I like that you can chose to add thick or thin cut beef, chicken and shrimp.   They also have tofu, mini scallops, etc. They have a wide selection of veggies and fruits so you don't really the need meat, or if you're like me you can load your bowl with a little meat and lots of veggies. It's whatever floats your boat here. I love pineapple and tomato in my fried rice so I liked having both those options. Are all the veggies as fresh as they could be? No but this is a make-your-own stir fry joint. What can you expect for under 10bucks and SOOOO much food?  If you like everything like me, properly being able to season your food is where this place gets tricky. There is like a zillion different sauce-and-flavor options. It's easy to get lost. Since we don't know what the sauces or seasonings taste like, it's hard to gauge how much to put in. I cook a lot so I don't feel this is an issue of whether or not being an experienced chef will turn a better result. I think someone would have to come back here a few times in order to really figure out what works and what doesn't.   Cheap sake bombs and decent food. Especially, for Asian food in AZ."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place for the first time and absolutely loved it! Great flavor and spice! Would defiantly recommend."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant a few weekends ago. The server asked if it was our first time, which it was. She was friendly and brought us our beverages quickly. We were confused after we went through the line, added our sauces, and handed our food over to be cooked. We didn't know if were were supposed to wait there or if it would be brought out to us. It was brought out to us as we walked back up unsure. The food was ok, but seemed pricey for how little we got. Also, yes I did pile my bowl high."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and this had been one of the best experiences, V has been nothing but awesome, she took care of us and even sang (I jokingly asked) I don't ever suggest to ask people to sing, cause who wants to sing for you? No one hahaha! It's a good health place to eat. Thanks V!!"}
{"text":"I was in town with my sister to use some PTO up, and this was the first place we went to.  First off, I'm a sucker for good Asian food and don't appreciate cookie-cutter Asian restaurants.   This place was the bomb! You pick you protein, rice/starch, then sauce and add ons. You can pile on however high you'd like, as long as it fits in the small or large bowl you choose! I packed that badboy to the brim! They then grill it in front of you on a massive hibachi style grill, the smells overwhelming.  Once served, it's go time. Asian zest (or spice, sweet, whatever sauces you chose) will take over your taste buds amd leave you wanting more.  I don't see how anyone couldn't like this place, it made me want a grill like the one they had at my own place."}
{"text":"Wow!  I loved this place!  I had no idea what to get, since I'd never been there before, but it seems like it's a win no matter what you might choose.  I can't wait to come back here many times to try different combinations.  The staff here are all super nice people, and our waitress checked on us lots of times to make sure we were taken care of and enjoying our meal.  SO so good.  If you haven't tried this place and you're looking for something different, go for it!"}
{"text":"Wow. The three stars is for the food and well I won't dare judge the entire staff on ONE BAD SHEEP aka \"Doris.\" The food is pretty good but I only took a few bites because the lady at the registered messed my order up. When the sweet, sweet cook brought up my order and explained that she can whip me up another bowl because its not correct the cashier yells turns to us and shouts \"let her take it, let her take it.\" It's not just about me but about other customers who instead of being welcomed with warm energy have to deal with a lady who has a huge attitude. Listen you old hag, (kidding, kidding, LOL...I'm totally not mad LOL so allow me to find humor in the situation). I'm not going to get punked into your poor customer service skills... She needs another job. Perhaps she angry because she's having a rough/long day... Whatever is going on in her life's reflecting through her work and energy for sure. HOWEVER Gerald the manager who also owns my favorite place next door (Carolina BBQ) is a total sweetheart and he showed us southern hospitality, he gave me a full refund and discount on food from his other joint which I fell in love with at first bite!   Try the food. Pray to God you get someone else to take your order and say Hi to Gerald and let him know what a fabulous job he's doing! I'm sure enough to say this is a 4-5 STAR place if not for the one wrong decision made in the hiring process."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and each time the anticipation was greater than the end result.    The idea is so exciting because the possibilities seem endless.  You can pay for unlimited meals or just one, but either way it seems a little expensive for what you get.  They give you 2 bowls - one for your food and a smaller one for your sauce.  You build your meal by going through a buffet line and choosing your meat(s), veggies, seasoning, and sauce.  You can pile it high to the point of overflowing or you can keep it small.  Tip: the veggies really shrink when cooked so your bowl will look a lot emptier when it comes back to you.  Fill accordingly.  Then you choose your starch (rice, pasta, noodles, etc.) when you get up to the grill.    The line is the real issue at this place.  If there's more than one person ahead of you, prepare to move through at a glacial pace.  As people mull over the options, or if they are out of something that someone wants and you need to wait for the employees to refill it, you WILL. NOT. MOVE.  It's horrible!    I've tried a few of the sauces and the only one worth a damn to me is their 3G sauce - their basic one that they say goes with everything.    I do like their soda machines (the type that you can choose any drink and add flavors).  They also have a full bar so you can grab cocktails with your meal.    I guess it could be a good place if no one is there when you are and you find your favorite sauces/combos.  But to me, it's not cheap enough/good enough to deal with the line.  If I want mongolian grill and feel like waiting on a line, I'll pay less money and go to Green Valley's Feast Buffet."}
{"text":"The food here is okay. However if you are on any sort of time frame don't come here. It took us approximately 40 minutes for us to get our food. Also if you expect to be waited on don't come here. You get your own drinks, build your own food and pay at the table. The only interaction I had with any employee was to be seated, when we asked where our food was, and when our food arrived. Nothing beyond that. This visit was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Just had a weekday lunch here and it there was a nice crowd - so I was hopeful it was going to be GREAT! But after the so-so experience I don't think that were rushing back anytime soon.  Staff was great - we were seated and explained the process since we were 1st timers - we then followed her to the buffet line where you pick your own ingredients - so if it doesn't taste good - that's your own fault.  They have a menu board and the ingredients that go into it - but you have to make it yourself.  I tried to follow along - but got lost and just started adding what I thought went into it.  I would suggest piling up your bowl with your favorites and don't go too heavy on the sauce.  I didn't pile on enough so when my bowl came it was very sad looking - and tasted just OK.  We also ordered pot stickers which I would not recommend.  Tasted like it was frozen and just heated up, and the sauce was like it was from a bottle.  I would say it is FUN to experience this at least once - but don't set you expectation too high.  Remember - if it doesn't taste absolutely delicious - that is no ones fault but your own as  you chose the ingredients."}
{"text":"I am here at least once a week, yes a regular bowl costs you around $10 ... BUT, it's huge and will last me for at least another day or so.  So if you think about it, you only spent $5 a day for lunch.  Not bad.  Pack as much as you can in that bowl!"}
{"text":"My friend has been wanting me to try this place for quite some time. She says that the choices are good and the selection was better than others made it out to be. I am a huge fan of stir fry and was willing to give it a try.   Overall it was not bad, I just have an issue with a few items. One, the bowl that they give you is not that large. Even the best of stackers will have issues with getting the most veggies packed into that tiny half sphere. Two, for the $11 it is not worth it, but adding an additional $3 for unlimited is a decent value. Three, the scallops are not worth it. I know, you should never expect decent scallops, but these baby ones are tough after cooking. It felt like I was chewing on rubber.  The service was friendly and my server offered me a new bowl without judgment. I have had better experiences with Mongolian BBQ."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a great lunch or dinner.  You can make your own bowl you can add whatever meats you want, vegetables, seasonings, or sauces.  If you want a delicious bowl add all the things you like in the bowl and it comes out amazing with so much flavor.   I usually add scallops, bacon, shredded beef, and steak for the meats in mine. Tofu, mushrooms, cilantro, green onions, for the veges. Salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, curry powder, garlic salt and pretty much what ever sounds good to mine at that time. The 3G and dragon sauce are two of my favorites, but I add about 6 or 7 sauces.  Have fun with your bowl, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went twice since opening. Both times ended up with bubble guts. The last trip (today) I couldn't even make it home.   Will not be back. And I grew up loving and craving Mongolian BBQ, but I can't stomach this place. *pun intended*"}
{"text":"Food wasn't as great as other Mongolian grill restaurants and took a while to get the food. Wouldn't choose it as a first choice service wasn't to bad but the process seems to much to do for eating food. Basically a self service place not worth the money."}
{"text":"I never tried this place but I recently got a $9.99 coupon for a regular bowl and drink. Figured I'll try it out. I made a bowl with chicken, broccoli, pineapple, corn, a few spices with fried rice, with no sauce. I'll say I was very disappointed in the taste. The meat was tough, fried rice was bland and dry. The food is cook on a black top which transfers a black burnt taste and smell. I tried it once and one time is enough for me to not go back again. I ate half the bowl and threw the other half in the trash. The staff was very helpful and polite to me. I'm not trying to be negative but just honest in my opinion. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"In all the food and the prices are really good the young lady who is the hostess is not very approachable and has a real smug attitude.   The grill coach is sloppy and did act like really cared about our food.  He wasn't careful and he drop items out our bowl before he put them on the grill.  Sloppy cook, needs to be retrained on how to handle people's food.    Our server at the table save the experience .   Boo to the hostess and the grill cook is a slob !   We will try again."}
{"text":"Genghis is okay. I have had better and I have had worse. It's nice being able to customize your bowl and adding only what you want. You can really stack a lot of protein into your bowl and the price is the same. Service is average- nothing notable to me. For a quick tasty lunch, genghis is good."}
{"text":"Honestly... Two stars may be a little rough here simply because - You created your own food here and it really can only be your own fault but.... It just wasn't for me.    I decided to go with a seafood geared noodle dish and my wife went with a chicken based one.  The vast selection of toppings and portions was nice, but seemed on the side of lower quality.  The crab really seemed like imitation crab (probably was) and the scallops were rubber.  Having said that - The chicken dish was much better.  3.5 stars good.  We both went with the \"stir fry\" sauce and it was simply fine.  Creating your own dish seems cool but honestly, why go out to eat just to prep your food.  Also, why the heck was their 15 waitresses there??  What was 20% for, I'm picking everything out, dropping it off, and all you do is walk it out.. .. That was confusing.    -Ian M."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the novelty of huge round hotplate and wooden sticks they use to cook? warm? the food. It was depressingly bland and both quality&quantity were lacking. $11 is a total ripoff I have to say. Their beef and broccoli dish was the saddest meal I have had in a while.  Food items at Charlotte Airport seem much more expensive than at other airports, by the way. If this is the best they can do, I might want to pack my own lunch next time I have to go through here."}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood and decided to stop in to take a gander at how the food was prepared and the atmosphere of the establishment. The foyer and the sections of the restaurant that were visible were grimy in appearance. We asked to look at a menu and while the young man was helpful we were astounded at how much food and filth was attached to his uniform shirt. In addition, the menu we were shown had coloring crayon inside on the inside .....no thanks to the view of childrens artwork. Pick a more presentable menu.   Needless to say we decided to skip dinner because of the filthiness of the place. Yuck."}
{"text":"Loooved it! I am a huge fan of stir-fry, and this place did not let me down. The second we walked through the door, we were greeted by a very friendly and knowledgeable host. After telling him that it was our first time visiting the eat-stablishment (yeah, that happened), he took our drink order and showed us where to go, what to do, and familiarized us with the process. Did I mention that they have a full bar? Oh yeah, baby. Tsingtao, Asahi, Sapporo, Kirin, and a bunch of cocktail drinky drinks. Back to the food, Christina... Okay, so they have 10ish different cards that you can look at with recipes on the back telling you all the different ingredients to pile into your bowl if you want \"Jamaican Me Crazy Fish\", \"Special Fried Rice\", and a bunch of other delectable suggestions. If I mislead you to think I need suggestions, I apologize. I don't. I wanted chicken, beef, fish, shrimp. I got them all. Genghis Grill has a great selection compared to the other stirfry restaurants I have been to. Among the common chicken, beef and pork, is shrimp, calamari, marinated lime chicken, marinated steak cubes, beef slices, marinated white fish, scallops, pork, turkey. Then come the vegetables. All the vegetables you would want in your bowl, plus potatoes, green and red bell peppers, and plenty others (the green beans were great!). Next, choose your sauce among the 10 or so various-all delicious- options. The peanut curry was a  tasty surprise. Of course I mixed a few different sauces into the cup, and I felt like a chef. Last, brown rice, fried rice, white rice, udon, spiral pasta, couple others I have forgotten. Pick just one, or remix that beautiful tastiness. Hand it off, and give them a few minutes to fry it all up. You'll get a number and have your bowl brought out to the table, and MMMMMMMM! If it doesn't taste amazing, you really have no one to blame but yourself. This restaurant gives you freedom to choose all your ingredients, right down to the seasonings. Only downside I could see would be pricing, but it's really not horrible. 9.99 for a regular bowl, 13.99 for a bottomless bowl, 6.50 for my beer, but it was a tall bottle. It can get a little cramped and slow in line-try to avoid the indecisive peeps. There is a small bar area, which is nice, and televisions to watch a couple games. It's a really chill, laud back ambience. I had a great experience, despite grumpy man in my party. There is a rewards incentive card (free), and you get a free bowl on your birthday. My birthday is on the 24th of August. Who wants to join me."}
{"text":"Pretty much walked in, went thru the line and walked out. That place was gross, smelled like vomit and was extremely unsanitary. I knew I'd most likely get food poisoning if we stayed.   I've worked in the food industry and I've been to other Mongolian places but this was plain nasty. It was a salmonella nightmare.  They were out of chicken so the girl washing dishes right by it went to get more. Same plastic gloves from the washing, touching door handles, etc and they were so used up they were falling off her hands. Then she takes the tongs from the chicken vat, puts them on the countertop, uses her hands to smooth out the new chicken in the vat then with her slimy gloves, covered in raw chicken picks up the tongs and puts them back in the vat. The tongs were disgusting. We all used them and got raw chicken all over our hands. They were out of most things, nothing looked like it was refrigerated or maintained. The items are three deep and you need loooong arms so they probably get all kinds of debris in the open containers from ppl having to bend and stretch to reach in. Nothing on their side was covered with a sneeze guard or anything.   It was Sunday night around 6 pm. Place was pretty empty but the hostess still put our party of two RIGHT in the middle of a large group of people.   I know people love this place and have enjoyed many meals here without incidence but I was not going to take that chance. It takes a LOT for me to get grossed out by a restaurant. This is my first and probably only review. This place needs an intervention!   I've eaten tacos from roadside stands in Mexico and have never been grossed out like this. Spillage everywhere u looked. Dirty floors, tables, etc.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"The food was so good! Everything was very fresh and full of flavor. The staff is amazing! The manager came to check on us twice, the cook came by to make sure we were happy and our waitress made sure we were well taken care of. This was an excellent treat for my husbands birthday."}
{"text":"Whoa...what happened?!?! Place was exceptionally messy at the food area....no steak! Service was slower than slow! We got 3 bowls and 1 bowl took over 20 min the other 2 came well after that and with 2 kids this wont fly!  So disappointed! The only reason I gave 2 stars was because they now have the coke machine that has like a million Flavors (sugar free). Other than that it was horrible tonight. Doubt we will be coming back anytime soon. Shoulda went to Tony Roma's..."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went to try this place out last night it was both of our first times here. We are familiar with YC's Mongolian which is something similar so we decided to try it out. I was very disappointed it reminded me of the cafeteria Chinese food from the cafe at my job. It's a wannabe YC's and I would not recommend this place. I gave it two stars because the sauce was ok."}
{"text":"Definitely a good good spot to stop for a wholesome lunch.  I enjoyed the variety of meats, veggies, and sauces.  Service was good, food was good, and the price wasn't bad at all.  If I lived closer I'd definitely come here more often."}
{"text":"The last 2 times I have been here with my family we have needed the manager. The food isn't what it used to be. Seafood has changed to marinated something. Standard shrimp and crab are gone! We were told 'too expensive' by the manager. Food bowl sizes have changed as well as prices, I'm sure. Food comes out burnt and mixed with the previous persons' bowl. We used to love this place but can no longer stand to visit."}
{"text":"Just the freshest ingredients to choose from and your a avid spice lover you'll defiantly love it here."}
{"text":"This place is very nice and fun. You actually build your own food. In a line you can chose the plate size, meat, veggies, dressings and sauce selection as well as rice or noddles. The staff always help you with recommendations for the best sauce mix and ingredients. At the end you get an awesome and delicious mongolian dish. They also have great choices for food, desserts and drinks. Every table has a tablet and you can order and pay everything electronically. I was very impressed with this system since i never saw anything like that before. Very cool."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The selection is vast and not too expensive. Happy hour all day Sunday-Thursday is a big plus. The only problems I have here is that the bartender cannot mix a drink to save his life (just stick with a beer) and if you want your food to-go it costs extra."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. My first visit I didn't really enjoy but the more I dined here the more I liked it and it really depends on your choices of ingredients that go into your bowl. They have a good variety of proteins and most come marinated or seasoned. They also have a ton of seaonings, sauces and veggies to put in. I always try to fit the most I can in my regular sized bowl and when it comes to my table I can't even finish it all so basically 2 meals from my regular size bowl. And like I said, how good the bowl comes depends all on your choice of ingredients. They also have new drink choices and I got the pineapple mint fresca and it really was refreshing and wowed me because I wasn't expecting it to be so good."}
{"text":"I went to Genghis Grill for the first time the other night.  My finance had told me about it, and I was a little apprehensive on the concept at first.  But I went willingly anyway (mainly because I was hungry, and I was not paying LOL).  When you first get there, you are handed a bowl, you're seated, and then you go to the area where all the food stuff is located.  This is where you can choose from meats galore, vegetables, sauces, and spices, and anything else you want in it.  After you're done choosing, you pick your starch to go in it.  The greatest thing about this place is that you're essentially the cook:  you pick the ingredients, the spices, and the sauces you want in it, so if you don't like it, it's your own fault, NOT the restaurants.  I really like that concept a lot.  So I was a great cook that night.  LOL.  Oh, and another thing:  when you first put your ingredients in the bowl, it's raw.  You give the person behind the counter your bowl full of stuff, and they cook it for you and place your stuff together (with your starch) in a larger bowl for you to pig out on.  I recommend this place to anyone who is a picky eater.  This place would have gotten five stars, but I'm not too keen with the wait staff.  If you can get past Skippy waiting your table, then you'll be fine.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Very happy to this open up.  I love mongolian barbeque and anytime I go to a buffet I order this fresh.  Nothing at a buffet at a local casino compares to Genghis Grill - there were more choices in meat, veggies, spices and sauces.  I do agree with other reviewers there are way too many tables in it and I could not reach the back row to get the shrimp and other options since I am 5'2 and have short arms.  I did like the TVs and got to watch some soccer and loved the decor.  We will give it a try again."}
{"text":"I'm actually pretty familiar with Genghis Grill during the old days of my Dallas misadventures.  I used to frequent the place quite often, and was sorry to lose it as one of my restaurant choices when I moved to the West coast.  Well, now it's back.  Or here, I guess is the better way to put it.  I've noticed reviews are all over the place for the restaurant, but my experience was good.  We got there before the dinner crowd, so we were seated quickly and ready to be served.  We did the \"Build A Bowl\" option, and for a $10.99 single bowl dinner price, that was more than fair, though the option to go \"unlimited\" is an extra $3.  Basically, there are a number of meats, vegetables, sauces and starches (noodles, rice, tortilla) to chose from.  You can choose how much you want of everything, and pick whatever ingredient options you want.  Because of the options, you can choose a lot of related things, or go for some pretty outlandish mixtures.  But it's on you if things actually go well together or not, so if you make something you don't like or didn't get enough.... Well, you made it, so there you go.  I created a veritable feast of meats, with enough garlic to kill off the cast of \"True Blood\".  You hang out, while they cook everything up on this huge circular grill, and after a few minutes, the meal is yours.  The options seemed to have changed/expanded since my initial Lone Star State visits, but really, all I cared about was my self-made meal.  And that's probably all I'll ever really care about during another return.  Service was pleasant and appreciative.  They also seem very conscientious about being respectful to food allergies.  While I have none, I'm sure someone will appreciate the extra \"Is this okay\" check-in.  Drinks were refilled quickly, the manager came over to chat and ask about our food experience.  And we got out just before they got slammed with customers.  And they do carry out, as long as it's not the \"All You Can Eat\" option.  All in all, I was pretty satisfied to revisit a familiar experience.  I will echo someone else's statement that I hope they open another location on the west side of town, because it's a bit of a drive, but nothing out of control.  Glad for a new food option.  I'll be checking it out again."}
{"text":"sayyyy waatttt?!?! five stars??? yessum boys and girls, this little joint is this shit and i am in love!  Loved everything about my experience with Genghis. Atmosphere, service, the food, prices, drinks...  you get the picture  $1 sake..And $5 sake bombers..Thank you Genghis.  To be able to create my own bowl with all the veggies, meat, seasoning and sauce i wanted it just put me on cloud nine. It's great because you go can go back time and time again and never make the same bowl twice. ( i want to go right now, who's down???)  Perfection is the formula when me and Genghis Grill combine. scrumdiddilyumptious."}
{"text":"A fast food Mongolian grill, nice idea, for some reason the decor reminds me of a panda express.  Anyways, as we know the food is what counts, so let's see.  A nice selection of proteins to pick from, one glaring issue, while its great to see them offering shrimp, they still have the vein in, not the first time I have seen this, but still not something I would eat.  Service has been good, waiter is very friendly, though my diet coke went MIA for a while.  I will say there is a large selection sauces to go on the food and they ask about allergy problems, of course selecting your own food to be cooked it should take care off this issue.  So the food has arrived, I guess I know how to pick good ingredients as it was pretty good. Some of the food was a little burnt, but all in all it was a good meal and certainly good for $11.  Gourmet it is not, but it doesn't pretend to be, it delvers as advertised to I am happy.  The waiter passed the empty glass test, it was quickly refilled.  So all in all, a good deal, good food, the shrimp thing bothers me though."}
{"text":"The food was great, healthy and plenty of choices. Prices are reasonable compared to other restaurants. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Overall we enjoyed it very much. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Finally tried it. Its a bit on the pricey side and they try their hardest to slow you down so you don't eat that much and up sell all the expensive appetizers and fancy drinks. They bring you these little dinky bowls to put your stuff in, which when cooked will amount to about 1/2 chinese food take out container. Have to get the all you can eat, or you'll starve to death from lack of food. They have way too many employees working at one time, they could get rid of about half of them and still run the place efficiently and maybe drop the bowl a buck or two, however the waitress we had was friendly, informative & helpful. The format is awkward at best compared to all the rest of the Mongolian BBQ's I have been to across the nation as they try to make this a restaurant experience & show instead of a Mongolian BBQ. It gets extremely crowded during the dinner hours and extremely loud, so crowded your practically bumping elbows with the party next to you. When you get up 3 tables have got to slide out of your way so you can squeeze through the little 4 inches in between tables (little over done, but you get the point). Kinda curious why they put on a \"fire show\" when they want you to sit down after giving them your bowl, you cant see it due to the booths and the yelling and gonging is kinda annoying.  If your tall like me, expect a workout to get anything under the sneeze guards. This place must of been designed by midgets (no offense to midget architects). The meats are average and they have a fair selection of veggies, but the sauces are either too sugary or too salty and unusually thick (like molasses) and its hard to fine tune to taste especially for heat. Don't listen to them when they say their sauces are hot. I dumped a ton of their real hot one (Khanzu Sauce) and it barely spiced it at all, and their powdered spices don't do much either.  But all said, I can make a fairly tasty bowl and that's why we came. Roommate really liked the Curry Peanut Sauce.  If I was on this side of town, and wanting Mongolian \"style\" BBQ, I would visit again. I figure I'll get the sauces down eventually, but it is definitely not worth a special trip or traveling from afar like from the Strip or Summerlin.  Well see if this place survives (which I doubt), its WAY too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Dear Genghis Grill:  Be better. I really want to like you.  This would have been a four- or five-star review if we were just talking about food. But since the restaurant experience is more than that, I cannot overlook the consistently bad, astoundingly unacceptable service here.  I am not under the illusion that being a restaurant server is an easy job, but in the world of food service, waiting tables at a Mongolian restaurant is on the easier side of the industry, And yet probably about 80% of the time when I have been here, there has been some issue with the service.  In most cases, the issue is, people aren't where they're supposed to be, pretty much ever.  I have walked into the restaurant and waited at the podium for ten minutes waiting for someone to seat me. because the hostess was MIA.  I've stood at the empty grill for five minutes waiting for the cook to come back to take my food..  I've sat at the bar for 15 minutes waiting for the bartender to show up so I could order a takeout bowl.  I have sat staring at my cooked bowl sitting on the counter getting cold, counting the number of servers who walked past it.  I can't figure out if they're always understaffed, or just clueless. Nobody does their job.  I have been waiting for years and years for a Mongolian place to open in Vegas, and I'm on the verge of writing it off forever.  This isn't rocket science. There is simply no legitimate excuse for the service to be this bad at a restaurant where the task of serving food is so simple.  I do like the food here but I honestly can't recommend it based on the uniformly terrible service. I can overlook quite a bit in terms of restaurants but everything about the service experience here is just frustrating.  I'll be back once you get your sh** together."}
{"text":"Well, I can see why they did not actually put Mongolian BBQ on the sign but like a few other reviews have put, they do say stir fry.... To say I am some sort of Mongolian BBQ snob is in no way true but I will say, living in Northern California you definitely get spoiled having some great Mongolian BBQ spots to go check out. Now please remember, when I say Mongolian BBQ place I am talking about bowls the size of buckets and that you fill with the thinly sliced meat and then have your boxing buddy beat the hell out of the meat so you can fit all the veggies and then create the mount Shasta of noodles on top and then flood the bowl with great sauces. That is what got our mouths watering when we say the sign for this place as well as the guy walking to his car in the parking lot talking about how amazing it was.   Perfect, we found a Mongolian place that the customers outside think is amazing.... Let me start by saying I would love to find out how often that guy eats spaghettio's for dinner because this place was the farthest thing from amazing. We were seated and given a menu, looking over it and seeing that one bowl is something like $10 plus $3 for all you can eat that should have been the red flag but then when the waitress brought our our pet food dishes I really should have known. We were handed 3 bowls if that is what you call them with some piece of paper that you have to pull some cirque stuff to hang onto. Let me explain these bowls, One is for your meat which is quite small and then the largest is for your veggies, now don't let the word largest fool you because it is far from that and they also give you this cup for sauce, it looks like the cups you get at chili's when you ask for a side of ranch. Really?? That just wont cut it for us saucy types.   Oh but Ray, the meat selection is the redemption.. Ha, sorry Mr. Genghis, the last time I check Peperoni and sausage sure as hell don't belong in Mongolian BBQ let alone a stir fry. Are you sure this isn't a pizza joint in disguise. I walked up to the meat and the chicken was floating in its own......well I'm not quite sure what that is that it is floating in but I know that it cant be good. I was so utterly disgusted by the choice we had just made to eat here but decided to give it a chance and move on down the line. Once you finish walking down the line you tell the guy at the grill what kind of noodles you want including spaghetti noodle... What the hell?!?!   So, by this time you have picked your ridiculous meat and your terrible veggies and filled your shot glass with sauce and handed it over to Brad the Mongolian Chef and you are counting on him to make it all better and well this is where the trip to Mongolia crash and burns literally, Burns. He dumps the bowls of goods on the burner and left it sitting there while they rang some crazy gong and damn near lit the place on fire. I guess it entertained the kids but while they are being entertained my food was charring.  I would much rather watch that guy skip around the grill turning my food while yelling ye-haw. That would definitely entertain me more since my food would be cooked correctly. Now for the biggest trick they attempt to pull, they have these bowls that are shaped like a piece of modern art that look gigantic but that is the one side the other sits about as high as the side of an inflatable raft in the ocean, if you are not sure what that is like just try it and you will see.   If you haven't figured out buy now, this is not a place that I would recommend and the fact that my wife and I both had terrible stomach pains that night after eating here guarantees we will never set foot back in this place and will definitely make sure our friends don't make the same mistake we did by thinking this was a Mongolian BBQ"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this location since it is close to home. First impression was not good. My family and I walk in and the floors are sticky. Gross me out. Then the server we had must have been on something she was so hyper and the things that came out of her mouth were ridiculous. Mind your own business and do not make small talk. PLEASE! Went through the line and didn't expect to see raw meat and fish in bins. That was not appetizing at all. I really don't want to see my meat before it is cooked. I chose scallops and if I go back I will to try a chicken dish. Veggies in bins were not fresh. Sauces were ok. Desserts were not appetizing. Bummed."}
{"text":"Literally anyone with taste buds and a digestive system can make it work at Ghengis. At one restaurant, you could walk away from the grill holding a bowl of.... 1. Curried fried rice with shrimp, egg, & sprouts 2. Honey soy brown rice with spinach, tofu, broccoli and carrots 3. White rice with teriyaki beef, sesame and scallions 4. Udon noodles with peanut sauce, pork, onions, and snap peas 5. Rotini noodles with roasted tomato sauce and sausage 6. Tortillas filled with BBQ chicken, onions, and peppers 7. Some disgusting combination of any/all of the above, plus calamari and some congealed sauce that was accidentally poured onto the food instead of into the sauce cup.  The endless possibility offers some novel appeal and exciting promise of your own creation, but it also makes it exceptionally difficult to know what will pair nicely together unless you're an experienced Ghengis-goer or you can already cook (and if you can already cook, what the deuce are you doing at Ghengis Grill?) Plus, if you do succumb to being overwhelmed by choices and your food sucks, it's your fault. Then, there's always the chance that your food sucking is not your fault... on two separate occasions, the chef has broken my egg before cooking it and just served me my dish, sans egg. What is fried rice without the egg? NOTHING.  Basically, if you're looking for somewhere to eat with a rather diverse group of uncultured people (or a lot of children) everyone can find something to eat for a 10 dollar flat rate. However, if you've got even an inkling of gastronome in you, don't expect to be impressed."}
{"text":"Best Mongolian grill I've had. If you go make sure to try the saracha chicken. Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Now, I've been a YC's fan for years, but, dangit, this is so much better.  The meat is raw and fresh, just like you get at the grocery store.  Every time i've been, the staff has been very helpful and organized.  The veggie selection is out of this world (they have baby corns!) And the sauces are quite creative. This is the spot: healthy, yummy, and they have one of those punch cards.  Love."}
{"text":"If you look at my past reviews, you'll notice that almost all my reviews are 5 Stars.  I just like sharing really good experiences with fellow Yelpers, who have always guided my way through culinary cravings or service needs.  And when I usually have a bad experience, I just let it go, mainly because I feel bad posting a negative review.  Not tonight!  I've been to Genghis Grill 3 times, and the last two experiences were both poor.  The first experience was a sit down experience with my wife, and it was a pretty good experience.  Nothing compelling enough to write a review, but a good overall experience.  So a couple weeks ago, we decided to place an online order for 2 large bowls.  They have a pretty impressive website where you can pick and choose your ingredients as if you were at the restaurant.  But unfortunately that's as good as it got.  After picking up our order & taking it home, they had mixed the ingredients between the two orders.  We gave them the benefit of the doubt, made the most of the meal, and called it a night.    So tonight, we thought, if we eat at the restaurant, it's pretty unlikely they'll mix the ingredients since you pick it out yourself.  Sadly, we never even got a chance to place our order.  After being seated, our waitress Taylor asked us for our order.  We told her we wanted 1 large bowl, since the last time we placed an order for 2 large bowls, it was too much food, and we only ate 1.  I told her if we're still hungry afterwards, we can always order more food.  She then snidely says \"you want 1 bowl for everyone?\", scoops up all her remaining bowls, and walks away, taking her unappreciated attitude with her.  I don't believe she even took our drink order.  So we left, and decided to dine elsewhere, and found a much more accommodating restaurant.  I get it.  I used to be a food server.  I understand that the bigger the bill, the larger your tip.  But treating your customers poorly and being rude is simply inexcusable.  For this, you have popped my negative review cherry, and I leave my first negative review.  =)"}
{"text":"Food was good and service was terrific. Cleanliness or lack thereof was a disaster. Treys were dirty with pools of dirty soap water and the sauce bowls were filthy. Men's room was worse than a bad gas station bathroom in a movie. It's really too bad that a place with great service and good food is now very run down and unsanitary."}
{"text":"I'm really frustrated with this place.  It's one of my teenager's favorite places to eat, but my experience yesterday will keep me away for quite awhile.  We've eaten here many times because...  My kid loves buffets where he can pile up on the limited amount of foods he likes. For example, at sub sandwich shops, he only has meat, lettuce and cucumbers on his bread.  Boring!  At Genghis grill he piles on the meat and adds broccoli an almost no sauce. He loves the Udon noodles.  I like the place too.  I make a mess every time (meaning I mix all the wrong things together) but I'm happy to do it.  I think the food is really tasty in spite of my culinary challenges.  I love the idea of this place, with TVs all around, and a full bar.  Unfortunately the execution falls a bit short with the TVs too high near the ceiling to be comfortable to watch for even a meal's worth of time.  The only TV I could see yesterday had a ceiling fan right in front of it.  The drinks are pretty pricey too, so there's better places to hang nearby if you want to watch a game (which I wanted to yesterday).  Now on to the service...  I don't like these semi-service deals where they bring you drinks and your check.  Am I supposed to tip them the full 15-20% like a regular restaurant?  If so, WHY?  Anyway... the gal who helped us was really short with us when we showed her my Yelp discount on my phone.  Yes, I showed her when she brought me the check, but I checked in on Yelp when I finished eating.  I hadn't asked for the check, so I don't think she should have had any attitude.  Then the thing that really sealed the deal was that I forgot my leftover box on the table (yes, I'm to blame here) but I barely made it to my car in the parking lot when I discovered it.  I was maybe 10 spaces from the door.  I actually jogged back to the restaurant and went to my table and everything was gone.  Everything was thrown out in 2-3 minutes from getting up from the table.  I had more than half my meal in there (it was full) and nobody even tried to holler at me.  They could have seen me out the front door all the way to my car.  I'm pretty sure it was my server who did it too because I found her and asked and she said YES it's been thrown out.  She acted a little sorry but I think she was happy to have \"gotten me\" for pulling up a coupon late.  So I left pissed off.  I got to my car and decided to call the manager.  I got the number and got him on the phone.  To his credit he offered to make me a new meal, but I was already down the road and didn't want to get out in the AZ heat one more time.  I didn't want free food.  I feel like taking free foods discredits the complaint to some degree.  I want to be treated better in the future.  Hopefully he spoke to her.  Grrrr... still irritated the next day.    I'd give lower than 3 stars, but it was just one 1 star day out of many visits.  I'd have given them 4 stores before today."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. Been coming here for years! Great atmosphere and friendly staff. They make sure you have everything you need. Good always taste great, it's fresh, fast, always hot and large portions. They have so many options for everyone. John is the mostly friendly server I have ever met!!! This place is must!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love going here- but they changed what didn't need to be changed. The menu is different, the ordering is different, they changed the interior- idont know why cuz it was still newer."}
{"text":"Genghis Grill is an interesting concept that I actually like.  I had a similar dining experience in Atlanta when visiting friends, and was happy to find this similar style restaurant here in NC. Went here for lunch.  If you work LONG hours, are protein loading, or have a big appetite, I highly suggest you opt for the all u can eat option for $4 bucks more.    When choosing your food, take time to sample your sauces and the seasonings!  My sister was a little more ambitious and ended up breathing fire for half of her meal.    Really, you can't mess your meal up.  Load up on your meat... and i mean LOAD up!!!  Get your fixins, spices, sauces, choose from noodles, rice, etc... and hand it over to the cooks.  You get back a great bowl of whatever you wanted!  I wish they'd open one closer to the Huntersville area, but I am completely ok with driving out to eat here, as it's a pretty filling treat!!  Service was decent too."}
{"text":"I was always a fan of Genghis Grill when I lived in Houston and was sad to learn that there wasn't a location near me in Chicago.  It's great to have Genghis in the CLT airport because I can always count on it being a decent standby for my vegan veggie and tofu fix.  I could not find their hours posted on the website however, today they opened at 10:00 am on a Tuesday morning.  I waited maybe 5-7 minutes and my bowl was done and piping hot.  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable.  This was the first time at Genghis I have ever been asked if I had a food allergy which was amazing because I could tell them I'm vegan with confidence they knew the meaning.  I always make it a point to stop in for a bite before my flight since all of the other typical airport stables, such as Chili's Too, categorically fail to meet my needs."}
{"text":"Exceptionally mediocre. We used to enjoy this place, but the last few times we've been here the meals have just been passable.   With the regular bowl coming in at $13, and without the ability to pile on your own starch (a la YC's), the value just isn't there. The premade sauces are thick and sugary, and not very tasty.   I am also continually frustrated by the presence of a waitstaff... while they do a fine job, it's just not necessary when you have to get up to make your own bowl anyway.   Fine in a pinch, but overpriced. Head to YC's where you can get soup and wontons included."}
{"text":"Update After the generous offer from Ajay for 2 free bowls we went back to Genghis Grill for dinner tonight. This time we actually ate in the restaurant instead of doing take out. This is probably the best way to experience the food. You get a table, take a card and go stand in the buffet line. You tell the person which size bowl you want and then fill it up yourself. This way there is no confusion on what you want in your bowl and you get to choose the amounts of each ingredient. I got a regular size and stocked up on chili beef, cabbage, mushrooms, onions, spinach. Then take your tray to the cook station and choose your side, fried rice in my case, and they cook it up for you. The flavors were again wonderful and of course even better since I got everything I wanted this time. The wait staff were friendly and attentive, although maybe a quick run down of the ordering process would make it less awkward for those who haven't been there before. Also, try the Coconut Honey Fizz, it goes great with a spicy bowl. A few thoughts on the process, nothing to the restaurant itself. A menu with the choices that you can look or maybe even fill out before going to the line would be helpful so your not standing there trying to make a choice and holding up the other diners. It would also be nice if the vegetables were first then the protein; only because veg tend to take up a lot of space in the bowl but then cook down significantly and it would be easier to stack meat on top of them and still get a decent amount of each.  I'll go back again, but definitely sticking with making my own bowl instead of online ordering."}
{"text":"Super poor attitude by supervisor. The wait staff (2 of them) told me to go to the bar and pay for the food since it was to go. When I proceeded to the bar the manager MEMO proceeds to get loud and ask me to leave the bar area, as if he wanted to be confrontational. Dude needs to calm down and take his minimum wage attitude down. Food was ok for the price but he killed my experience for sure. Won't be returning or telling anyone."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Drinks were never served, I got my food but the person I went with never got theirs so we left. Absolute mad house. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"This is just an updated review.  My previous review still stands and the stars remain unchanged.    I have been back twice since my first review, and I will say that as long as you stay away from the rice, it's good.  I had the noodles the last two times and have been fairly pleased.  I'm still unimpressed with the contortion that needs to be done to reach ingredients in the back row, and the staff remains fairly uninterested and/or too casual.    I ordered a watermelon lemonade on my last trip and it was foul.  Didn't have any taste of watermelon, and through that nasty flavor I could hardly taste the lemonade.  It tasted medicinal.  I couldn't get through a fourth of it.  I'll likely be back, but staying with the safe choices of noodles and soda."}
{"text":"Good just to surf your stomach with something which is fresh cooked.....  BEWARE this isn't a make yourself Mongolian restaurant you just select your dish and then get a pre mixed small portion of that in a plastic boxes. The sauces were a bit extra in the dish."}
{"text":"Good food. Only complaint I had was that the waitress never refilled our drinks. Major botheration for me."}
{"text":"My My...There are some serious haters of this place. I'm glad that I didn't read Yelp before going. I actually went because two people in my office raved about it. I went there on two different occasions to buy gift cards for birthdays. I finally decided to go with friends. I've only been to one other Mongolian grill place so there isn't a lot to compare. All that I can say is that the service was mediocre and not terrible. The food was good. I like the concept of making your own meal with ingredients that you like.  My partner didn't follow instructions and put the sauce in his food bowl instead of the side bowl. They made him go back and put more sauce in the side bowl. Ultimately what happened was an inedible bowl. None of us can figure out why they made him add more sauce. It was too much sauce and not good. Three of us; however, enjoyed our meal. I didn't know that this place is a chain. Oh well...I'll go back because I enjoyed it. I'm not sure that my partner will though. The idea of the sauce makes him queasy,"}
{"text":"My first impression wasn't very good.  I have been to many of the mongolian grills before and find they use frozen meats both killing taste and making your bowl look full but really on the thin side as the meat doesn't bend to make room in the bowl.  The restaurant atmosphere is essentially a cafeteria, not designed for comfort but rather to cram as many people into the restaurant as possible.  The concept is fun and my daughter loved it.  Grab your bowl and get in line, as you progress you choose your protien from shrimp, scallops, pork, chicken, beef, sausage, pepperoni, etc.  Then your spice including salt and pepper, cajun, etc.  You can mix spices. Then your veggies and there is a wide selection.  Finally your sauce, again you can mix and they even recommend some mixing.  They have sweet sauces for the kids and spicy ones for the adult kids :)    Then it is off to the cooking station to pick your starch from various rice and noodle options and then watch them stir fry your meal on the round grill.  I have to say the food was excellent.  The ingredients were fresh and not frozen, the flavor was great and the sauces were tasty.  The best thing is it is a bottomless bowl for an extra 2.95 (free for kids) so you can eat as much as you want.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"It has been years since we visited Genghis Grill at a different location. Staff greeted us warmly and our server explained the changes since our last visit. He recommended a medium-sized bowl, describing it as the most popular size. Hubby and I had eyes that were larger than our bellies and chose large bowls. He explained how to build our bowls. At the end when I was selecting my rice, the sever suggested I go back and pack my bowl a little more to my surprise. There are lots of toppings to choose from... meats, veggies, sauces, etc. Our bowls arrived at our table quickly and they were delicious. We had to stuff ourselves to hold it all! A medium definitely would have sufficed. Oh and make sure to ask for shrimp sauce if you like it. The servers will bring it to you.   Great experience and can't wait to take our kiddos back!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy! I love coming here with my family. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have always been obsessed with Genghis. I have been getting the exact same bowl for years... It just never gets old. The great thing about this place is you get to customize your own stir fry! Meat, veggies, spices and sauces! If you like a spicy sweet sauce, do two full cups of soy, and a cup half garlic water and half khazu sauce. You can't beat it. I use that on chicken spiced with dragon salt and Cajun. Spinach, onions, bell pepper, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, pineapple... It's addicting.  Generally, service is great. I've only had one problem with this place. The last time I came here, I got food poisoning. I was so sad and contacted Genghis to let them know the situation. They handled it nicely and offered me drinks, entree, app, and dessert on them, but I moved. I probably wouldn't have used it anyway since that's not how I roll. Obviously they valued me as a customer though, so that is nice in itself! I would go back here someday even though I died that one time from FP. That is how much I love this place.   Also, Genghis is way better than YC's. Yep, I said it."}
{"text":"I've had better than Genghis Grill.  Why is mongolian BBQ difficult to find these days?  I can't find one in my neighborhood and someone told me to try Genghis Grill out. Since I was going to be in Tempe, I figured WHY NOT?!  Genghis Grill is  not my thing.   We got seated and handed a small metal bowl, I was confused.  At the other mongolian places I have been, you start out with a big bowl not this dinky bowl.  So, I say \"whatever, fatty\" in my head and head over to the start line to get this meal going.  What do I see?  Nothing but the sickest thing I have seen in a long time.  A BIG-ASS BOWL of BLOODY MEAT, just sitting there in a bowl of blood.  I've never wanted to be a vegetarian so badly in my life.  I suppose I was used to YC's where the meat is frozen and shaved.   I don't like actually seeing the blood of a meat product, it really grosses me out.    Anyhow, the bowl didn't fit nearly as much food as other places, I guess it's good I didn't over -stuff myself but the price was higher and that whole  meat product area was really bad.  Oh and the scallops, I think they were scallops?  Anyhow it was like a bowl of white fluff (you know marshmallow fluff? in a far?) No real shape to them.    So this whole \"fresh\" meat, chicken area is one of the grossest things I have seen in a long time.   I must say that after it was all cooked and brought to the table it was more than enough food and it tasted okay, not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"When my husband and I first moved to the Phoenix area we would go to one close to us, but it closed.  We have since gone out of our way to go to this one, and never regretted it.  The staff is wonderful.  We hadn't been in for several months, but when we went in the other day the waiter remembered us.    If you have questions or you need help they are always willing to help.    I love the fact they take allergies into consideration as well.  As then I don't have to avoid bringing family or friends that I know have nut or shellfish allergies."}
{"text":"I love this place, perhaps more than YC's. The food is fresh & the selection of fresh veggies is awesome. One thing those-those little bowls they give you aren't cutting it! I tend to overload on veggies and find myself making a mess & then I feel bad, like I'm the jerk the workers have to clean up after lol. I never get the same thing every time..its like an adventure! Haha. The Khanzu (I think that's what its called) sauce is the best sauce I've tried so far. I liked that you get so many choices for your starch, some are more interesting than others (spiral pasta? tortillas?).. I'll just take the brown rice please! And pass the Sriracha!   I love this place so much I ate there twice last week...or maybe its because I live like 2 minutes away & my roommate had never been. Either or, still a great place, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Always a tasty meal, I love that I make my own flavor combinations and have as little or as much as I want of a variety of things.  Gave the hubby white rice when he asked for brown, nice waitress was happy to get him on the side.   I think it's our third visit and wish there was one a little closer to the house and we would definately eat here more often,"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about this place. It was slow when we went in, so service was overly efficient -- he was around all the time -- and quick. Everything was plenty tasty, from the chicken pot stickers to the chicken stir fry.  What I don't like about places like this is serving myself. You stand in a line, fill up your bowl with your toppings -- including raw meat -- and let them cook it for you. When the check came, it was $75 for four people to eat and share an appetizer and a dessert. Plus we had to do some of the work! I'd go for a quick bite to eat for lunch or something, but probably wouldn't go back again if I was looking for a nice dinner with table service. It's a little too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I eat at boofays all the time, so believe it or not my problem isn't with allowing patrons to handle their own serving utensils and potentially cross-contaminate food allergens or bacteria.  My problem at Ghenghish Ghrihll (where the heck do you put the \"H\" again?!?) is with the way the staff handles their meat. Sounds pretty yucky, and it is.  After going through a useless ordering procedure instruction by the server, the complications of which are rivaled only by the ridiculous ChinoBandido http://www.yelp.com/biz/chino-bandido-phoenix-3#hrid:Rc5orUUva9KTB4kMp7EgMw , I winced as i grabbed a serving tong laying on top of a pile of raw meat, dished out my portion, and went on touching other serving utensils on the veggies and spices and sauces. GROSS.  Guessed about what to put on the dang thing, and was scared, really, since the server warned to be sure to know you like what you put on by tasting it with a tiny spoon ( from a bowl where it was touched by all those other peoples' grubby germ-laden meat-tongs-hands) .  GROSS.   Thinking that \"well, at least it's going to be cooked now,\" I hand my dish of e-coli-laden vegetables and warm grey meat chunks to the ''chef'' and scurry into the restroom to wash my hands with soap.   When the food finally comes (long wait) to our table in the overly cramped dining room, the portion is onderwhelming and the thing is ugly.  The veggies are overcooked, and when i try the meat chunks, they are undercooked to the point of being rubbery instead of flaking apart as i chew. GROSS.  I will admit i got lucky and concocted a decent flavor, but it was a total fluke.  Unimportant.    I was counting on that warm, grey, pile of exposed-to-the-public meat being cooked through and through to eliminate any food borne bacteria sure to be lingering around after its recent history of unhealthy handling.  The server was more than happy to allow me to fill another bowl, and the guys said i could have them start cooking the meat first and add veggies later , but why should i have to ask for that?    Well, it didn't matter, because i never got the chance to even have them cook up that second bowl.  As i stared down at the sloppy serving station, trying to decide if thinly sliced meat meant more or less chance of bacteria, I watch a staff member fill up the raw chicken tray with more rubbery chunks.  He does not place the new container in the server and pour the old meat on top of it, but instead simply pours new, frozen meat on top of the old thawed meat already in the bin.  This is not only against common sense, but against food handling procedure.    Who knows how many times he refilled this way that day, or how long the meat down in the bottom of that container had been sitting there?!?   GROSS.  If asked whether I prefer to allow all of that sort of thing to just go on behind the closed doors of a kitchen where i can't see it - YES, that's exactly what I prefer."}
{"text":"I've never posted to yelp, but I just love this place. The servers are very sweet and helpful...even to recommending a marvelous tasting drink (Peach Paloma).  I had one friend that had a negative experience, but everyone gets to make one mistake and mine have all been amazing. The lunch bar is less extensive, but still plenty for the most discerning appetite. Evenings and weekends; let go and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I was looking to go to YCs and ended up here by accident instead. Decided to stay and try it and definetly didnt regret it. Cost a little bit more than YCs but its so much better. A lot more variety of meats, veggies, and sauces, and they also have spices which YCs doesnt."}
{"text":"My family and I go to Genghis Grill a couple of times a year and we always have a good experience. The service is good, the food is fresh and delicious, and I love that you can customize your meal to make it as healthy or delicious ;) as you like. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that: 1. It is kind of pricey in my opinion,  2. The kids menu is just sad, and  3. they got rid of my favorite citrus sauce BOOHOO :(  Other than that it's a great place."}
{"text":"It's a little more pricey than I like for lunch, but good stuff overall.  They do a good job.  You hear lot's of comparisons to YC's and, while this is the same concept, this place has more/better things to put in your mix."}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of flack for portions but I really don't see it. I'm a big guy, I can put food away with the best of them, and a large bowl was more than enough for me! Learn to pack the bowls guys and you can very easily get your money's worth! Riane, my server, was that sweet spot of attentive and, very kind. The cook Christian easily listened when I said I had a mushroom allergy, and after he heard that, He then proceeded to scrub the grill spotless for me. Thank you to the staff and manager Bill for making this dining experience top notch. Alcohol is available, and the tea I drank was fresh and pleasantly flavored.  The bathrooms were warm and clean, the whole place is inviting, come here soon!  P.S.- Dont forget to try the chicken lettuce raps they are a meal in themselves and very delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow.  Me and a work buddy were looking for something new for Friday lunch and were wanting something bistro/hibachi/mongolian-esque. So we settled on this based on reviews and the three of us wanted something spicy.  We knew it was a build your own bowl place but had no idea what to expect.  When we got there we noticed it had a hipster vibe and looked generic, but trust me, that is just there to draw in more audiences. The waiter was super friendly and explained to us the bowl sizes. We all opted for the large.  When you get up to the bar, the choices are a little overwhelming. I'm going to tell  you now. Don't worry about satisfying palette combinations as it all comes out meshing well together in the end despite your preconceived notions about stir fry.   The first time we went in order and it is a bit hard to get a good amount of veggie combos on top of the meat.  The second time I learned you can do veggies first which it is much easier to stack the comparable slimy meats together.  You can literally stack as high as possible( the serving dish is easily 5 times the volume). You can even arrange broccoli to expand the walls of your bowl to make it hold more.  Be wary of the spices and sauces and the first trip me and my buddies were literally sweating.  The bowls are a lot of food even without proper stacking techniques.   They even let you take home extras.  The only downside is shrimp costs extra but you can make a fire dish after a couple of trips.   It's amazing and great for the family.   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is okay for a Mongolian grill. I advise doing your own to get better value.  I think the pre-made meals aren't as much meat but maybe I'm wrong. I got all meat and veggies with no rice and it was pretty good. I think I have a coupon so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch today with a friend. It was really nothing that I would run back for. I think the goodness level kind of depends on you, as you add the ingredients, including seasonings, sauces, veggies, meat, and starch. I think the instructions could be more clearly displayed. First you see meat, then you come upon dry spices.... I thought this was going to be the only flavor source for the food, so I used too much.... if I go again (big if) I would choose maybe just ginger or something. I used a bunch of garlic, only to find fresh garlic later down the line. Curses!   They do have a good selection of veggies that seem fairly fresh. The meat is real cut up meat, not that weird freeze dried meat that is used at some of these places. I thought their choice of noodle is a bit weird... udon.... kind of thick and slimy... I would have picked like soba noodles or rice noodles or something. That wasn't a huge issue, but just something I thought was weird. I had them put the chili garlic sauce mixed with kung pao mixed with a hint of peanut sauce... turned out fairly good.   Also, it is a bit pricey, especially when you only get to go up once, so you can only make one sauce decision.... if you screw up, you're kind of screwed. Also, other places allow you to get soup and rice or something with the entree.... that would be nice considering what they charge. If someone suggested it again, I would go, but I wouldn't go back on my own."}
{"text":"At first we lived this place but we've been back and out most recent trip we received awful service. We were seated and no one came over for at least 10 minutes. We flagged down another waitress who said she'd tell our server to come over. We waited for another 5 minutes and she didn't apologize and didn't address the issue at all. The food wasn't as good as it was before and they meat offerings changed and we more limited."}
{"text":"I'll never eat Y.C.'s again.  Not that Y.C.'s Mongolian BBQ is awful (although it kinda is), it's just that Genghi's does the whole build-your-own-stir-fry thing so much better, with fresher ingredients, that I don't see the point in lowering my standards for any other comp.  I'm glad I don't live closer to one of Genghi's Valley locations because I'd end up eating there more often that I'd like to admit.  My favorite concotion involves bean sprouts, beef, water chestnuts, lots of bell peppers, baby corn, two eggs, and dragon sauce over brown rice. It's just perfect."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but I cant. YC's is a much better deal.  Smaller portions, higher prices, drinks not included, no extras like soup and frozen yogurt and a server that you need to tip for not doing much of anything. Bleh  If I'm going to stand in line and create my own meal, let me wait for it and carry it to my table so I don't feel obligated to tip.  Nice selection of meats and noodles, sauces and spices - but I would never choose this place over YC's. Tried it 3 x's and just don't like it. They do serve alcohol here so that is a plus."}
{"text":"I've been to many mongolian bbq places all over the country but this was not mongolian bbq. It tasted like a poor excuse for a fajita. None of the \"sauces\" had the right flavor and even the suggested combinations were terrible. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Especially if you have ever had real mongolian bbq. It was a real disappointment."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when my friend was telling me about this place at first. But we went and it was SO good! I LOVE stirfry to begin with but this place is just awesome. You get sooo much food if you get the medium. I have a whole extra meal!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, I love how you can put your meal together to your liking . The staff was helpful and friendly , place was clean and the food was delicious. We didn't have to wait long for the food and it was hot and ready in a to go box. Five stars !!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband I came in to order food to go and the girl at the front desk asked us if we'd like her to watch our little one while we built our bowls! She definitely didn't have to do that, but she went above and beyond! P.S my daughter loved her and it was a  really great experience when it could have been stressful trying to chase our daughter while making our food;) I didn't catch her name but she had long red hair and tattoos! Thank you ;)"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  Best value that $ can buy. There are so many options of meats, veggies, sauces, & starches to chose from. Manager \"Rob\" is the coolest dude on earth. He always makes sure you are taken care of. You can't go wrong here because you are the one who determines what you want and you actually are the one making it.   Eat here folks!"}
{"text":"Get the Thai Chicken or Beef Broccoli. The food is always fresh and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Starving in the Charlotte Airport while waiting for a connection, I ordered the Thai Bowl which was little more than frozen vegetables and chunks of dry chicken with a bland curry-peanut sauce. Not the worst airport food I have ever eaten but definitely room for improvement, especially because each bowl Is $11 without drink included. Next time I will try the BBQ joint next door!"}
{"text":"As far as Airport cuisine, this place wasn't bad. I got the chicken with stir-fried rice and aside from being $10+ and portioned on the smaller side, the flavors were balanced and the dish was well done. Nothing in particular about the food here stands out, but it filled a void in my belly.   Worthy of noting, if I wasn't starving my money would be way better spent at just about any chinese take out joint, but being in an airport the value ilfor your buck is to be expected. Kind of like popcorn at the movies I suppose! In my honest opinion, the dish I ordered should have been about $6 and not $10+ so for that I give this place a weak three stars."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day and was expecting a lot more. My waitress barely waited on me and kept giving me nasty looks. I thought maybe it was because she may have been hormonal (she was in her 3rd trimester), but she smiled at other tables and as soon as she came to mine, I kept getting the same nasty look. She stopped at every table but only zipped past mine. It couldn't have been because the hostess sat me at a further table. She sat me there herself. She asked me if everything was good and before I could even say anything she was already off somewhere else. It was as if she was pretending to serve me. The guy who brought me my bowl asked if I wanted Sriracha or soy sauce and I asked if I could have both. He walks off and passes by my table. I wait again for him to pass and nothing. He passes by a third time and goes to the hostess area and gets on his Facebook. The table they sat me at was wet when I sat down. I had to use the one napkin they gave me to wipe it off. I don't know what was wrong. It was as if they were in a hurry. There was no rush. It was about three in afternoon and there were only two other tables. The amount of staff outnumbered the amount of guests. The bowl they gave me had some dried food on it. I had to ask for another one. When it came time to pay the bill was a little under 20 dollars so I left a 20 and just walked out. Smallest tip I have ever left in my life. I pay 15% even for mediocre service, but this level of WTF, idk, they should have paid me to endure that."}
{"text":"Yuck. YC's is SO much better! I mean, who knows how \"fresh\" that raw meat really is. This was my first visit and I won't be back. It took 30 minutes for 1 reg bowl take-out and the place was Empty. Not impressed. Save your $15 bucks."}
{"text":"A typical Mongolian BBQ place.  Nothing incredibly special but nothing terrible.  The only memorable part of our dinner was the company.  Compared to the place back home, it wasn't as good (and I didn't think that much of that place already).  Regardless, it was a decent--and cheaper than most places on the strip--place to fill our tummies before a night of drinking back on the strip."}
{"text":"I love Mongolian BBQ. No, you don't understand. This is a thing for me. I was working in the DC area for a few months a couple of years ago and every week, we had to go to BD's or someone would go into withdrawal. Usually me. There's just something about a stir fry where you pick your own fixings and spices and they grill it right then and there.  Everything here is very fresh and a good selection of proteins and veggies and stuff to mix in. Plus a dozen powdered spices and another dozen sauces.  There's no complaining - everything in the bowl was selected by you. So if you're wondering where that chicken or crabmeat came from, look in the mirror!  Service is quick, even when it's busy. Drop off your dish, get a number and the server brings it to your table. Easy, pleasy, lemon squeezy. Yes, there is lemon juice too!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices for food in the Charlotte airport these days. Genghis Grill is similar to their full size restaurant format, except that instead of building your own bowl you get one of their premade bowls. I assume that you can add or remove any ingredients, but I went with the Firecracker Shrimp as it comes.  A good amount of shrimp with bean sprouts, onions and peppers. And a lot of spice. This was HOT. Lots of hot pepper and their \"dragon sauce\" on it. And that's a good thing as it was tasty and filling and it took me a good 15 minutes to eat.  Probably not the kind of food you want to eat on the plane. There are many tables here in the atrium area where you can get some sunshine and watch the folks coming through TSA security.  By far, one of the better choices in CLT for a meal."}
{"text":"My server Ashley was amazing! She recommended us a variety of drinks that we to die for... by far she made our experience great and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Ended up going here with friends because YC's had already closed for the night. Portions were tiny, especially for the price. The \"small\" build-your-own bowl was really tiny, not even close to being enough for a sizeable meal. For the same price at YC's, you get way more for your money. That being said, food was fresh and the sauce selection was pretty good. Our server Michael was awesome! Michael was the real MVP."}
{"text":"awesome service, hands down. i really did love genghis until the whole menu change and switcharoo crap that they just integrated, My wife was really disappointed they took away some of her fav veggies. all the sauces are still the same, you can now choose from 3 different bowl sizes instead of getting just 1. everything tasted really good! there's really not much to complain about except the change. But I do like it here, and frequent often."}
{"text":"Always love this place! the management always hooks us up if something goes wrong, or if everything's not perfect! good service, great food you can pick out to your likings. YUM. good quick eat and go place."}
{"text":"This is a good option from the other places at the airport. I was attracted to this place because it seemed really healthy and fresh. I got the chicken teriyaki with udon. It was ok. I did not expect it to be as sweet as it was. There were too many pineapples which I didn't expect at all. The noodles were fine and the chicken was ok. It was a bit bland but satisfactory. It definitely tasted healthy. It's fairly priced comparatively. You can get your food in less than 10 minutes which is great if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in town! Went last week and have already been 2 more times! You can pick what you want in your bowl, stack it as high as you can. I love, love this place. Before I even leave I'm thinking about when I'm coming back! We get a big bowl, and it left over next day."}
{"text":"I love the concept of genghis grill, and after messing up at YC's with too much sauce and seasoning, I was very careful. I really like how the protein is fresh, not frozen, and they have many different options. I mainly stuck with chicken and steak, and really piled on the veggies. Lots of options! I also added noodles/rice and sauce and seasonings before lettin it sizzle while I went back to table to have my drink already there. (Great happy hour specials) When my food came it was a huuge portion!! It was absolute perfection! Also scored points for the sriracha:). Plenty of leftovers, and one happy girl means I will be back:)"}
{"text":"First time going to Genghis Grill and it was excellent!   I give all credit to the server John, he made the experience enjoyable. Perfect explanation of the concept and was friendly.  Great food, great service and a great place."}
{"text":"I moved here from SF in June and found an ad for this place in the mail once.  It talked about these fresh drinks and delicious Mongolian food.  I've had Mongolian BBQ before and have always been a fan.  I thought I'd give this place a try.  I love this place because you can pile in as much food as you possibly can into this bowl.  I got the shredded beef and piled it inside the entire bowl.  Usually people like to put all of the meat in the bowl.  I smushed it into the bowl and created a meat bowl within a bowl to put in chicken pieces.  Then there are the spices.  Put everything in that, then came the vegetables.  Use every vegetable you can find.  And then come the sauces.  Make sure you get more than one cup if you want to optimize your experience.  Use every sauce you can think of.  They cook it for your and you're ready to feast like the great Genghis Khan used to after murdering thousands of people.  YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It allows me to get great quality and healthy food at a cost of only $10.99 per bowl.  The service is still getting up to par but it doesn't out weigh the food or the experience.  I wouled highly recommend.  I did find seating kinda cramped."}
{"text":"The service was amazing! Food is really delicious and creative. So many different combinations that are all your own. Perfect for meat lovers and vegetarians."}
{"text":"Better taste and quality then Yc's. However, way over priced and tiny tiny portions. I was seriously confused when I was handed a tiny bowl to put my food it. I wasn't very good at stuffing all the ingredients I wanted into the bowl, but I figured the noodles i requested with it would be more than enough. I ordered it to go, couldn't believe it was $10...got home and realized my to go box was less than 1/4 full. I seriously have the smallest appetite, and 9/10 times have left overs with every meal. I ate my entire to go box, and was still starving. While the food tasted good, it definately wasn't worth $10.  Oh, and it was super super confusing. One needs to pop a xanax before visiting this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best sauce I have ever had.  I really like this style of dining and this place does a great job. I have never had such flavorful sauce choices at any Mongolian grill ever. When they bring the food out the smell is just divine. I have been twice and both times I was super happy. Little bit pricey, but well worth it to me."}
{"text":"Update:  The manager contacted me to make amends. I'll give the place another shot and will write my review afterward based on that visit. In the meantime, I'll raise their star rating based on the manger's outreach and offer.  Original review:  All it takes, sometimes, is a smart-a** belligerent assistant manager who likes to attempt condescending remarks more than he likes correcting problems to mess up an otherwise good experience. I hope his attitude does not reflect accurately the restaurant's attitude. It's usually a good experience. It's worth a roll of the dice to see if your experience is better than my last one."}
{"text":"My whole experience was nice. I love the selection of meat and spices and veggies they have it's like a feast for the eyes! The portion, when combined with noodles or rice, was good for two people! I think I paid about $10 and the bowl was overloaded I took some home. Next time I'll try having it with rice instead of noodles."}
{"text":"Very good resturant, my husbnad and i always go there. Very good customer serv. And the food is deli."}
{"text":"Just witnessed employee walk out of restroom and didn't wash his hands.  Disgusting. Couldn't eat there."}
{"text":"Decided to skip the BBQ next door today and try the stir fry. If there's a line, it's definitely not as fast so be wary of your time. I went with the Chicken Teriyaki which comes with an assortment of veggies and your choice of white rice, brown rice, noodles, or udon. I'm a sucker for udon so I chose that. The noodles weren't a s thick and chewy as traditional style ones I've had so I'd maybe try the chicken fried rice option next time. For the money, you get tons of food. I couldn't even come close to finishing it. Everything's cooked to order too so its piping hot when you get it. You could easily take this to go because it comes in a resealable tupperware style container, but the smell would be pretty potent if you were to take it on the plane."}
{"text":"Love this place,  finally a place I can get as much meat as I want,  with no useless fillers...   Nothing else to say...    Lots and lots of meat..  Yummy"}
{"text":"They are yummy. Typical Mongolian BBQ style. Get your bowl, load it up, they cook it, you eat it. Bowls seem a bit small, but if you're getting all-you-can-eat that really doesn't matter. Plus when you throw in a starch it ends up being plenty of food. Service is fast, even when they are super busy. Which seems to be all the time! I like them, but since they are in Tempe I don't get there often. That could be a good thing for my wallet, and my waist."}
{"text":"Pros: -good selection of veggies, meats, and other items to put in your stir fry -staff was friendly when they messed up my order (they made it w/ rice instead of udon noodles) -the sirloin tip was tasty -I like the Dragon sauce -the dining area was clean and comfortable  Cons: -the stuff in the back row of the assembly line is hard to reach, at least for me. and I don't think my arms are unusually short. -you don't get a TON of food for your money, like at YC's; disclaimer: I haven't been to YCs for about 5 years so I don't know how expensive they are now. for $11.69 (including tip) I got a small bowl with udon noodles that filled me up, but just barely if you know what I mean. I was hungry again 2.5 hours later. -like other reviewers said, handles for the sauce ladles are sticky and stuff  overall, I like the healthy aspect to this place and it's a great place for vegetarians since there are so many veggies and tofu to add to your stir fry."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is convenient because it's close to my house and it's also very good. You basically pick all the meat, veggies, and sauce you like and bring it over to get cooked. Food usually comes out fairly quickly. For the starch items, I like to do a combo of half fried rice and half udon noodles. It's usually more than enough food for me. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This place definitely exceeded my expectations. At first I was expecting more of a \"quick service restaurant\" type of experience, but it was much more casual dining which I appreciated. From start to finish, the service was good. And the food was amazing. I definitely suggest dining here for those of you looking for a delicious meal especially if you're looking for a more \"casual\" experience versus a quick one. Plus they have a bar! Can't forget to mention that!"}
{"text":"The service here was amazing. ASHLEY. Was great she made sure we were taken care of and fixed anything that went wrong. I would recommend this place to everyone because of her"}
{"text":"Really like this place - a variety of meats, seasonings, veggies, sauces, and starches to choose from.  The 3G sauce is my favorite.  Always delicious and satisfying.  The first time I went they really encouraged me to pack my bowl down with stuff to get as much as possible."}
{"text":"I do love me some Mongolian BBQ! It was the best night at the chow hall in Iraq. With that said, I have had better than here. Dont get me wrong they have a wonderful selection especially sauces. I just felt like my rice wasent cooked well. To me this is just simply basic. I may or may not go back. This is not the only place for this type of food.  I do want to point out the service is great! Everyone that works there is really nice. Just wish there were more to this place."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have never had an issue, but tonight I was less then impressed. My son added bacon to his bowl and luckily he only took one small bite since it was pretty much raw. Aside from raw bacon everything else was alright and they did let him remake his bowl to go. Aaron was our server tonight and was great."}
{"text":"They no longer have steak which is a bummer, the shaved beef just isn't the same.  It was still yummy though.  This location I've noticed they particularly like to pack people in like sardines and never have enough wait staff.  The servers are always really nice and try their best but they are just really overworked. So if you go to this one be prepared to have to ask for every refill, they will forget things, you'll have to wave your server down if you want anything, but the food is good and the servers are always nice and accomadating."}
{"text":"Nice to see the parking lot full and the good ratings. Looking forward to trying it again in the future."}
{"text":"I grew up in Michigan and one of my favorite Mongolian stir fry places anywhere was within driving distance. Unfortunately, they are not in Phoenix. And since moving here I've been looking for another place to get my fix.  Genghis Grill is the best I've found yet in the valley. Not quite a perfect replacement but I certainly think it is pretty good. Choosing your starch was a nice touch. Not everyone feels like rice.  I feel like some of the sauces are pretty bland but it does give you the ability to experiment. Also there are options on the menu for kids that may not be into stir fry.  The only complication we had for service is that we both went to build our plates. While gone, our table was bussed. Having some sort of card that says someone is at this table may deal with that possible confusion. Also if you decide you want more than 1 bowl, having to wait for wait staff can be frustrating. I understand that it makes it easier to figure out who got 1 bowl vs all you can eat. But when the place is busy, you may be there a while if you want seconds or (somehow) thirds."}
{"text":"Good food, it's like a subway but for Asian food. One of the greatest things about subway is your ability to indulge exclusively to the level of your dietary comfort, Ghengis Grill accomplishes the same feat.  Where it goes one step further is by giving you literally. Ever. Option. Under. The. Sun. You can build a bowl comprised of a gigantic plethora of vegetables and beans; any assortment or amount of seafood, meat, poultry, and tofu (depending on the day); coated in an exponential combination of seasonings and flavors; and seated atop a bed of any common carb source you could want. It's impossible to leave without having eaten what you wanted to eat. The restaurant is fantastic.  The staff is extremely friendly, and truly welcoming. Unfortunately their prices are not; their are deals depending on the day (and your birthday :D) but for a healthy casual place to eat it's terribly overpriced. Additionally, I have seen similar franchises which offer the same experience but with unlimited bowls, for a cheaper price. This restaurant should just commit and make themselves a competitive contender for the average persons choice in a casual meal.   This reviewer suggests you grab a date or fly solo, and explore your palette on a delicious feast."}
{"text":"I enjoy making and watching other people trying to stack pounds of stuff on the bowls trying to get their moneys worth:) the food is always good and service is pretty smooth. the first two times the messed up my rice but were quick to offer to fix it."}
{"text":"As far as this type of restaurant goes I vastly prefer Genghis to YCs. There are a lot of reasons why I prefer this place. One of which is that their meat looks much better then what YCs puts out. Also because it's not frozen there isn't a ton of suspended water content which means that when you get your food back it tastes better and the sauce isn't overly watery. Not to mention there is no freezer burn!  The veggies here almost always look more fresh then what I've come across at YCs. I love my onions and here they are crisp and freshly cut.  The portion sizes are a bit smaller, there is no denying that. But as far as flavor goes this place takes the cake from YCs."}
{"text":"Really great concept. You get to decide on what you want to eat and every time you can make it different. And you always have leftovers! I will always stop in when I'm at tempe marketplace even if I am not eating, I can grab a ice cold beer or one of their yummy drinks on the menu. When you go in I suggest trying the blue dragon and bring a friend so you can get the fishbowl size! It's a perfect instagram photo! #soyummy #nofishies #thegreatestservers"}
{"text":"The food was good. It is a bit expensive for what it is. OK, super expensive for what it is. You get your own drinks and prepare your own food... then tip like you're being served everything. The setting is a cross between Cicis Pizza and Panda Express.   The biggest problem is the gross food setup. The chicken tongs had raw chicken all over them, with everyone touching them with their bare hands. Same with all the meat. Then you get the veggies, and other customers touch their raw meat with the veggie tongs, and put the tongs back into the veggies. Totally unsanitary.   We'll see how many bathroom trips we have tonight."}
{"text":"I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, wanted to like this place. Let's start w the positive. Nice atmosphere, liked the bar and the fact that we could get mixed drinks, great staff! VERY friendly and helpful! Definitely the best looking Mongolian place I've been to. Unfortunately you can not eat all the above! If so it would be a 5 star joint. The food... Well it's hard to explain but it's not Mongolian BBQ. If they'd have left the mongolian out of the name and just called it Genghis Grill Stir fry, maybe I'd feel different. I just expected real Mongolian. I know it's a chain restaurant and you can tell they spent some dough in this place. But how do you screw Mongolian up? It's like these cats way over thought the concept? The meat was not good. The veggies combos were all wrong. And the sauces, which a prob the most important part were to thick! Way to thick. I don't care about the metal bowls and the cooks banging the gong when tipped, all I wanted was some descent Mongolian. What they have is way over done corporate over americanized Stir Fry.  Apparently you can get fajitas though? All you can eat! What a joke!"}
{"text":"I had the Thai chicken bowl which was advertised as a red curry. It was probably the worst meal I have ever paid for. There was almost no chicken and no curry - just a mush of nearly unrecognizable vegetables and who knows what else. Stay away."}
{"text":"Seriously absolutely horrible and so over priced!  I will never return to this place!  Tiny bowl for way too much money!  Sauces were horrible, seems like they maybe come from large tubs that are purchased from somewhere like Costco.  The little form they give you says you get to pick two sides with your stir-fry, I asked for my rice on the side.  The rice came in the bottom of the bowl soaked in the horrible sauce they offer!  Save yourself and don't eat here, not worth the money at all!  If you like these type of restaurants go to YCs.  Better meat, bigger bowls for less money, rice on the side, free soup, free ice cream and just an over all better experience!"}
{"text":"Not too sure about this place for business lunch. Definitely not the quick stop I was looking for but the food was good. I expect a place built for lunch with the grill set up like YC's to be quick, so people can get in & out during the work week. I waited for a while for my waiter to show up to get my drink order, and there was a long line waiting for food. I made it through and sat back down to wait for it to be cooked, but the whole process took much longer than I was prepared for.  When I finally got my food it was tasty. So, the food is good, and the service isn't horrible, but the processes just aren't built to get you in & out quickly."}
{"text":"Another amazing lunch this time Wendy was our server everything went prefect even the cook boys did perfect  Like I was told Pile up always great deal . Will be back."}
{"text":"Seriously?!?! I don't know if I should attribute the deliciousness to my seasoning  or to them for being so brilliant with the concept and execution?! I wish we had one closer to home. For now I only come here for lunch. It's a casual setting but also good as a dinner spot! I haven't even begun to tap into the many possibilities of the bowls I can create. I'll be coming back! Build it yourself and pack as much into that little bowl as humanely possible!!!!"}
{"text":"Of course, it's airport food so nobody expects a lot. It's overpriced but that should be overlooked at any airport. The two bigger issues were the service (they messed up 3 straight orders so took over 15 minutes to get the food) and the fact that the food was exceedingly bland. It wouldn't be too hard for them to make it look nice, add some flavorful sauces, spruce up their fried rice and make this place good, but instead its like a high school cafeteria."}
{"text":"Food was good today! Tried this place when they first opened and it was meh...now much much better!!! They seem to cater to the customer now...very good customer service! Food is fresh and lots of variety...  maybe defrost the coolers so veggies don't stick to the bottim of pans.. now if the young chefs would follow along with the program and get things done instead of chitty chatting then everything would be good!"}
{"text":"So far the best experience I've ever had in a restaurant in my entire life. I'm from India and moved to San Francisco in 2009 and I'm visiting family in charlotte. I believe our server name was BILL and he was very nice and polite and friendly. I haven't experienced that in many places. I felt so comfortable and welcoming. And of course the food was awesome I was kind of frustrated with the process but man the food came out great. Thanks for this great experience. You guys need to bring this to San Francisco!! And not to mention the free refills on the drinks and you can choose different drinks as well."}
{"text":"I have now been to Genghis Grill twice. I absolutely love this place!! The service is incredible! EVERYONE there is friendly and professional! Nothing but smiles! The food is delicious! I don't eat beef or pork so I love the different choices of seafood! I will continue to eat here. Thank you Genghis Grill!!!"}
{"text":"honestly the food is great at time but me and my buddys just got food poison and it was right after we ate here. We told the person that was grilling for us to cook a little longer but we can tell he was rushing it thats only reason writing the review because i wouldnt want anyone else to get sick like we did just make sure they cook the meat entirely."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place for Mongolian BBQ. I come here every time I'm in town for lunch. Love Tempe Marketplace. It's best if you build your own bowl, but you can use their bowl suggestions.  I like eating the sliced and seasoned beef, the blended seasoning, a dash of cayenne and garlic.  For veggies, I use beansprouts, onions, bell peppers and snow peas. I like blending the sauces (teriyaki, mongo bbq and szechuan). Top off with some fried rice. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been patrons of Genghis Grill for a number of years now and have always found the dining experience to be satisfying and a good value. Until today. We visited after a two or three month absence to find their prices significantly elevated and their customer reward program diminished. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on a busy Saturday night and had such a great experience due to the yummy food, and mostly due to our fantastic waiter Amy! She was so helpful and sweet, and speedy in getting us extra drinks and tortillas, and she would notice ahead of time when we were running low on napkins and drinks before we even asked and would get us more right away! She has been one of the best waitresses we have had at any restaurant we have been to in a while! The manager even walked around and stopped periodically at our table to see if we needed anything, which was a nice touch with it being such a busy night for them. We will definitely be back for the great food, but even more so because of the great service!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was awesome! I love how you can create your own dish! Best idea ever! Amazing sauces and wonderful servers."}
{"text":"This place is amazing you get to pick you own everything. So picky or not your going to like it :) will definitely come back soon and often."}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place! I've been too many times to count on my lunch break. The service is always great! Theres not much for them to do though. Aside from refilling your drink and bringing appetizers to your table if you choose to order them. But they are really helpful and friendly. When you walk in, you are seated immediately. You will place your drink orders and grab a card in the center of the table and head to create your bowl.   They do have bowl suggestions. You can grab a card and use it as a reference in creating your bowl. Thats if you want to stay on the safe side. But you can also create your own from start to finish. How it turns out is entirely dependant on you! Don't be afraid to pack your bowl to capacity!! Trust me, you won't be alone. Once you tell them what size bowl you'd like, you 1st select your proteins. They have a wide selection of meats. Some are even marinated. I always pack my bowl with proteins. Its more important than veggies! lol! Next is the seasonings. I prefer to season each of my meats differently, so i'm always back and forth between the sections for each of my proteins. Then you have your veggies. They have just about everything!! I'm always packing in my veggies because i've already filled most of my bowl up with meats. Sometimes there's overflow on my tray but they'll go ahead and cook it as long as it doesn't get out of control. Then you have your sauces. They have tasting spoons at the beginning of the section. Once you start tasting sauces theres so many to choose from and they are all good so its hard to decide. You'll want to add a mix of all but dont do it! Be conscious of how they will combine. It really affects how your bowl will turn out. Make sure to discard your tasting spoon at the end of the station in the trash.   Then you head to the grill where you choose your starch. People don't know this but you can choose 2 starches! I always get Fried Rice & Tortillas. I don't like when my rice is mixed in my bowl so I always get it on the side. They can also cook your rice with an egg. You'll need to let them know this at the grill. They'll then give you a number to place at your table. Theres hand wipes and nuts as well at the grill. I always grab a couple of togo sauce cups and head back to get me a couple sauces to dip and add to my bowl as I eat. Also, if you ask the server they can bring you cheese and sour cream for your tortillas. They cook the bowls really quick so it won't be longer than a 10 minute wait for your bowl and they'll bring it to your table.   Even when my bowl doesn't come out exactly how I like, I just love it anyway. Because its never horrible. Its fun also, to be able to make your own bowl and experiment each time you go to see what works and what doesn't. No complaints with this place."}
{"text":"Love Mongolian BBQ, Love this place.  Everything is always fresh and has the best varitey of any I have been to.  Would have given it 5 stars if they had the traditional sesame and other cool oils...."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I was pretty hungry when I stopped into Genghis Grill. The concept is similar to other locations in the valley with smaller portions than others I have visited. The staff was super friendly and very helpful but please.... the buffet where you load your food was filthy! Not just spilled food, but dirty bowls to heap your food into and crusty little sauce bowls too. I can't believe the health department hasn't taken a peek at that. The food was fair but I just couldn't get past the mess. Sorry."}
{"text":"I work here at the airport so I have tried most of the restaurants and decided to give Genghis Grill a try. I was sorely disappointed. I ordered the Thai chicken with udon noodles and what I received was some noodles with chunks of frozen veggies and dry pieces of chicken tossed in a very pepper based sauce. Nothing like the described \"peanut\" sauce on the menu. Was a complete waste of $9, will definitely not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat.  You pick out your protien(s), seasoning, veggies/extras, sauce and noodles/rice and they cook it up and bring it to you.  For just a few bucks more you can make unlimited trips and try a really wide variety of stuff.  They have a rewards program online."}
{"text":"I really didn't think this place was as bad as the reviewers have made it out to be.  That said, I've never been to the YC's that's been mentioned, maybe I'd change my tune if I had.    I've been to lots of Mongolian grills and this seemed right in line with the rest.  I did find it a little strange to have a server, especially since we were about 10 feet from the grill, but it's not a major complaint.  He kept our drinks filled and grabbed some chopsticks for our 4 year old when he overheard that he wanted some.    The food was tasty and seemed fresh.  I happened to like that the sauces were pre-mixed, it took some guesswork out of it.  A lot of places have \"recipes\" on the wall so you can make certain types of sauces, but if you don't get it right it can ruin the entire bowl.  I liked knowing what I was going to get.    FYI - you choose your carbs (rice, noodles, etc) at the grill instead of in the buffet line.  I was a bit confused when they didn't have any to add to my bowl.  I found this nice as well because I didn't have to pile my bowl as high."}
{"text":"My boyfriend absolutely loves this place he goes at least once a week. I'm definitely a fan as well. You get  A LOT of food for only 10 bucks and its quite tasty. It takes a few times of going to get it right though with the different combinations of sauces and spices."}
{"text":"Me and my bf went to try out their food just because it's close to home and we pleased. The service was excellent and the food was very good. 2 drinks, 2 medium dinners and an appetizer came to $40.00. We were told to pile our food high but  did realize just how how we needed to pile. We  both got Udon noodles as a starch and it somewhat overwhelmed our plate.So when they say \"pile high\", listen:-) They also have a computer type device on the table which was fun. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Just had a horrible experience here. The host was rude, she had to move other employees stuff off a table to clean it but left the table top dirty, we had to retrieve a cloth to wipe the table ourselves. Waking up to the food line there was stuff sprayed up on the wall the ingredient cards were stuck together and the food line it self was absolutely disgusting. We decided to just leave and go somewhere else. Never again."}
{"text":"Aaron is awesome.  Will come back soley to chill at the bar and enjoy his personality"}
{"text":"There's only one thing I can say about this place... It sucks.  The food was okay, but it took forever for them to cook it... Not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The food was good, the waitress was excellent but the place is FILTHY. Our shoes were sticking to the floor near the food and the area where they were cooking was gross. I don't know why it hasn't been reported."}
{"text":"Amazing concept and food.. If you dont like it, it is pretty much your fault for lack of picking what you like.. Everything down from sauce to dry seasoning to add ons are all your choice.. I loaded up with meats and veggies with fried rice and was stuffed.. Pricey by some standards but its a ton of food, well worth it"}
{"text":"I've always liked Mongolian BBQ places, but this is not my favorite chain.   I have been to this location a few times and to one in TX a couple times.  This location is not as good as the one I went to in TX.    They have several fish options included in their base price, which many other Mongolian BBQs exclude.  They have a good house sauce that I like to use on my bowls.  The positives pretty much end there.  First, their whole setup makes it difficult to get to the third row of ingredients.  You have to sort of bend your head below the sneeze guard to get to that back row.  There should only be two rows or the sneeze guard should be raised.  Even those with longer arms than me had difficulty reaching to those ingredients.    On my last lunch visit (this past Sunday), the shrimp had a strong fishy smell.  I took a couple bites of the shrimp and I could not stomach it.    Their fried rice is DISGUSTING.  I have tried a lot of fried rice in my life and, being 1/4 Ilocano, I make my grandfather's recipe.  Of course I am partial to my family recipe, but even when I haven't thought a place's rice was up to par with Papa's, I was still able to eat it.  This rice just tastes like salt.  Blech.    The service was okay on our last visit.  We went without drink refills for most of our meal, but the server remembered our refills around the same time he remembered our check.  He was very helpful once it was time for us to leave.  He even made sure we were signed up with the email club for discounts.    Overall, this is not \"on the list.\"  Would i return again?  Maybe.  I would rather go to YC's or BD's (is there a BD's in AZ?) but, if I was hungry and in the area... I might head in."}
{"text":"I liked the old Ghengis Grill and the current changes that they have made makes you feel like your teacher is looking over your back which makes you feel uncomfortable.   No wonder why the 2 locations in Paradise Valley and Scottsdale shut down.   They have 2 size bowls and then give you a tray to hold your bowl. Use to be able to get as many eggs as possible and now are restricted to 2. Use to be able to get tortillas and now they charge you for them.   I understand why the owners changed things but if you take away things that your loyal customers had don't expect them to come back.  Before this place was a 5 stars, now they are a 3 star.   Don't like the new changes and don't know if i will come back."}
{"text":"They have the raw meat placed before the veggies so the patrons use the veggie tongs to fill their bowls containing raw meat and then the tongs go back into the veggies.  This creates a disgusting cesspool of bacteria on the veggies.  I'm shocked someone hasn't died from dining here."}
{"text":"The selection of meats is diverse and fresh, which is surprising for a Mongolian stir fry restaurant.  You have a choice of the typical fare: steak, pork, salami and crab, but Genghis also offers fresh calamari and shrimp.  You can also add several veggie choices and egg.  Yes, fried egg!  The sauces are all tasty and you can pick up a dish card that gives you paint by numbers ingredient instructions for those that don't want to concoct something on their own.  There are 5 noodle options and the cooks add those after you've given them your bowl of stuff-you don't have to balance your pyramid of noodles as is the case at YC's.    I've never had a bad bowl at Genghis.  In fact their fresh ingredients and friendly waitstaff make this one of my favorite eating spots in the Valley.  Ask your server for cheese and tortillas for your bowl.  If you consider it a challenge to stuff more and more into your bowl every time you go, make a bowl within a bowl with your meat selections.  Add your meat(s), contour the meat around the bowl and then add your other stuff.    They also have excellent daily drink specials, including a half off happy hour on Saturdays from 10PM 'til close.  I recommend getting any of their specialty drinks at that time.  *Tip*  Sign up for their Khan's Reward Card and earn free bowls and get a free bowl on your birthday."}
{"text":"We're in CLT for a few days and got super excited to find this GG. Atlanta had a few but they closed down due to poor service/reputation. We were very happy to find a friendly staff, clean food line and dining area and great food. Just what we were after. We'll be back next time we come through."}
{"text":"Food was awesome with a lot various of protein, veggies, and sauces. The drinks were pretty good, I got the blue dragon which was amazing."}
{"text":"From the minute we stepped inside, the staff seemed very unhappy to be working. This place was near empty. I made a comment about the dirty bowl I was handed and Kelly, if that's her name, said I could grab another bowl from the next table. The cutlery and bowls were not clean. So, since I made one comment, the whole entire staff was informed and I felt uncomfortable. I decided to watch my food being cooked and apparently this is unwelcome as well. Then, surprisingly after the cook dumped my food into the serving bowl, he sneezed into his elbow which unfortunately was near my bowl. I followed the person carrying my bowl. The man said, \"Who do you have? Good luck\" Wow. Okay.  I couldn't even eat at this point. Sam came to the table because my daughter explained what had happened. Sam is apparently the manager and he made the comment. He apologized and gave me a card for a free bowl next visit. No thanks   This is generic Mongolian BBQ. If you don't mind dirty utensils and bowls, immature staff, cooks that sneeze in your food, and subpar food that costs more than it should then this place won't disappoint. But, if you care about cleanliness please  save yourself the trouble and just go somewhere else if you're hungry. This was a very unpleasant experience."}
