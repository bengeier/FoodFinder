{"text":"Terrasse très agréable dans une rue derrière la rue principale. La carte est variée même si sans prétention mais offre des plats de qualité surtout concernant les plats de poisson. Leur duo de gambas et scampis frits est remarquable. Le service est attentionné. 

Leur sabayon est extraordinaire et surtout il arrive en 6 minutes alors qu'en France on vous demande 20 minutes d'attente au minimum ..

Une adresse à recommander dans cet univers touristique"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment last night at this place which is otherwise recommended by Eyewitness Books and Trip Advisor reviews. The ambiance is nice, with a vine-covered terrace off a cobblestoned street, although a bit cramped and short on space.

Service was friendly but slow, with many requests for bread, olive oil, utensils unheeded.

Food was surprisingly terrible for the four of us. We are HUGE foodies and love Italian food. This was unquestionably our only bad meal in Italy, and it was really bad. Our adult son had chicken on polenta, the chicken was full of bones and tendons, and the sauce was stale mayonnaise. Our son had to spit it out and was almost sick on the spot. Our teenage son had roasted duck which was very gristly. The entrees were worse - all four were misses. Our sons had heavy pasta dishes, swimming in fatty, overdone sauces. My beef carpaccio was still frozen, with shavings of mediocre parmesan. My wife had undigestible veal in another heavy, slightly putrid cream sauce.

We skipped dessert and coffee and ran for the street. It took lots of herbal tea and grappa to forget the foul taste of the meal, but the exhorbitant bill is there to remind us that this really happened and wasn't just a bad dream."}
{"text":"This was the perfect lunch while day-tripping in Bellagio. The terraced dining room is tastefully covered in greenery and other quirky decor. We luckily just made it before the afternoon closing hours, and this place is worth it. I opted for the Lake Como specialty, a perch filet lightly fried and served over a parmesan rice with browned butter. This was one of my most memorable dishes on my short visit to Northern Italy. Rich, intensely flavored and the sage leaves provide the perfect contrast of flavors - there are just no right words to describe it. It was just A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Wonderful service and accompaniments as well."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch right when they opened. I was bummed about the lack of water view but the relaxed atmosphere and amazing food more than made up for it.  I ordered foie gras as an appetizer and pasta with tomatoes as an entree.  Everything was delicious! Even the white house wine was terrific, we had a great time.

The only glitch was the bathroom; I'm still not sure what magical powers operate the sink so that the water would come out, there's no handle or button to press."}
{"text":"Found this on trip advisor and it did not disappoint. Really interesting tastes, great hosts, very good deserts and house wine."}
{"text":"The food was great great great. If you are ever in Bellagio I highly recommend this restaurant. The service was okay because they were so busy but the past, pizza and seafood is to die for."}
{"text":"Started with a delicious pasta with EVOO, garlic and red chili peppers. Just the right amount of heat from the peppers and the pasta was al dente! 
My husband had the Sea Bass with olives and capers. It was done perfectly and tasted wonderful. I had the veal with lemon sauce and the flavor was wonderful and the veal was very tender. 
We finished our meal with the creme brûlée"}
{"text":"Bra service og utrolig god mat! Kan virkelig anbefale gnocchie med pesto (hjemmelaget og utrolig god!)"}
{"text":"I had a lovely lunch here, after calling ahead to see if we needed to make a reservation.  Though we didn't, they saved us the best table looking out at the lake and a nice, steep pedestrian street towards the lake.  The whole restaurant is on the second floor, up a small flight of stairs, open on the side so it feels like a covered outdoor patio.  

The restaurant owner was friendly, helpful, and inviting.  We enjoyed glasses of local white wine, a fresh caprese salad, served as a huge dollop of buffalo mozzarella on top of a full tomato, with basil leaves on the top; and prawns in a light curry sauce over gnocchi.  We also enjoyed the local amaro, Braulio, after our meal.  

By 12:45 on a Monday, this place had filled up.  A couple of patrons brought their dogs and the restaurant was great about this, bringing water for the dogs and giving them a bit of love."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Worst meal of our Lake Como trip. Standard touristy fare. I would only come here for the cheap pizzas, for those on a budget."}
{"text":"Gayle and I had the pleasure of spending 3 Vacation days in the Lake Como area. On our last day, we bought a mid-Lake boat pass and thoroughly enjoyed the mountain scenery, the lake-side Villages, and Villas, and an overall relaxing time on the water. Lake Como is gorgeous, even though the haze significantly detracts from its beauty. 

We also decided to go on shore at Bellagio, the self-proclaimed \"Pearl of the Lake\". The place has a classy Old World Elegance feel, if you don't mind occasionally feeling like a \"Tramp in the Palace\".  And even in September, there are lots of people here, especially on the waterfront. 

After wandering about a bit, we were ready for Lunch and decided to walk up the hill a bit to find a nice restaurant. From Rick Steves' tour book, we picked Ristorante Terrazza Barchetta. It's a pleasant 2nd Floor Terrace with no Lake view, but with an elegant, yet causal vibe. We ordered a full bottle of wine, plus portions of Tagliatelle Agnello and Risotto Salsiccia, and settled into good conversation and a long delicious meal.

There was only 1 other party in the Restaurant, a young couple with 1- and 2-year old girls who were acting in an \"age appropriate\" manner. Mom and Dad were attentive and loving parents, and Grandma Gayle couldn't help herself in engaging the young ones from a distance. At one point, the Mom apologized for her children's behaviour, but there was no need for that. So in addition, we started talking parenting tips and about where were from an what we did. As it turned out, the Mom was a British Pop Star by the name of Lily Allen. Gayle and I had to look her up afterwards, and I'm sure Lily and her Husband Sam were just fine with the fact that we really didn't know who the hell they were, other than good parents with 2 really cute girls. Hence, they are not in any of the pictures I took during Lunch, nor did I ask for an autograph. However, if Sam and Lily ever happen to be in Town and need a babysitter, those girls will never forget G.G.'s (Grammy Gayle) loving care of her young ones."}
{"text":"We traveled throughout Italy for a month and this spot was one of our favorite meals.  The highlight for my husband and I were the entrees.  My husband had truffle risotto and I tired the gnocchi in a butter and sage sauce.  Both dishes were excellent.  The gnocchi was incredible and literally melted in my mouth.  We would come back to this spot!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were in Varenna and looking for dinner suggestions close by.  We met a couple who said they ate at Barchetta 3 times.  We were quick to make a reservation. There are 2 restaurants associated with this space. The lower level is a pizza place.  The top level is Barchetta. A lovely dining experience filled with great food and wine. The best part of the experience is the proprietor welcomed us and took the order.  There were servers who delivered the food but wow....what a great little customer service experience.  If you enjoy a good sit down meal with good wine....I highly recommend this place.  And be sure to try the squash blossoms. They are fried but not greasy or heavy."}
{"text":"What a nice place. Back off the beaten path and on the second floor. Had lunch. Really good sautéed clams and mussels, pumpkin soup, and a stunning and fine tasting squash blossom salad. Nice wine list too. Fifth star withheld due to less-than-inviting atmosphere created by stiff and businesslike service."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant anywhere on Lake Como, a Rick Steve's recommendation it delivered.  The décor is amazing, the menu is filled with great seafood, pasta, and unique dishes.  In a party of 12, everyone loved everything ordered. The salads, desserts and vino were all top knotch, and the little dog they have patrolling the dining room is adorable."}
{"text":"Not sure if Ben L and I have the same restaurant. Barchetta is located on Salita Mella and Via Centrale. We are here during the off season when many other restaurants are empty, and Barchetta was PACKED. Good sign.

They specialize in wood oven pizzas, so that's what we got. The sausage/mozzarella/tomato sauce pizza was so delicious. Crust is thin, crispy, and purposefully a little burnt. Moz cheese was stringy, chewy and had a great bite. Sausage was fresh as well.

We ate like kings and it only cost us 29 euros."}
{"text":"This place was magical. Best food we had on the trip. Excited to try some local fare - fish appetizer was amazing. Service and ambiance were wonderful."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great staff.  A must stop In lake como,  Italy.  I can't say more but must stop. Veal excellent sea bass. Pesto bolognese   Great"}
{"text":"Take care that the Yelp directions for Bellagio are whacky. This wonderful restaurant is near the ferry station in the touristic area. Fine service. Had the sea bass Mediterranean style - excellent. Preceded by a pasta aglio, olio with peppers that we split. Just right. Wife had a veal dish that was done perfectly. Best to make reservations."}
{"text":"The calzone was huge and incredibly good.  The frites were excellent.   We loved our selezione di formaggio.   The service was excellent to Italians and professionally polite to Americans.  We have noticed this in most of the restaurants.  The pacing was terrible we got all our food at once and it didn't fit on the table.  We were in late night for a snack.  They are open late in the off season.  Food is five stars."}
