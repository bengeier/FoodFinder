{"text":"Food was good enough, but nothing special as was the service. What was served didn't entirely match the description on the menu. Might have been something that was lost in translation."}

{"text":"Ugh... I have mixed feelings about this place. The smoked meat sandwiches are mouth-watering, the meat was perfect and the rye bread was not dry at all.

As for the poutine, it really is a hit-and-miss, sometimes the fries are left in the open for too long and they absorb so much moisture from the air they're no longer crispy, and they become hard to eat.

The chicken thighs and ribs were alright, very mediocre comfort food that are enjoyed by lots of seniors."}
{"text":"This restaurant was just like the American Denny's except the service was better, the place was cleaner (and super retro!), and it seemed that everything you ordered came with fruit on the side. I ordered breakfast with eggs, toasts, pancakes, homefries, and bacon. Bacon wasn't as crispy as I would like it but everything was yummy and came hot. I was pleasantly surprised to find on my plate a slice of orange, pineapple, and a couple blackberries. Prices were also similar to Denny's prices. Would definitely come here again.

4 instead of 5 stars because it's like a Denny's. It's good, but it's not the highest quality."}
{"text":"The food is not much to write home about. 
It's very generic and for the geriatric set, good to take elder relatives.

But the good thing is the prices are very good (discounts for 60 and over)
They serve breakfast til 2:30 and the menu has a bit of everything for everyone.

The decor is a bit worn down and the bathroom area needs an overhaul, but with the great service it's overall ok"}
{"text":"Nickels is not bad, but not amazing. It's very conveniently located on the wedding strip of St. Hubert, and perfect for a quick lunch during your power shopping day. Grab some protein from a chicken club sandwich to keep you going (highly recommended). Staff are courteous, mostly bilingual (and if not, will still do their best to help), and the atmosphere is attempting to reflect an old diner but unfortunately lacking that happy buzz of poodle-skirt-wearing teeny boppers. 

Overall I do recommend stopping in for lunch if your purpose of the day is shopping; it's quick, a great alternative to \"fast-food\" and full of the right stuff to help you power through. However, I would not of out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"The food was decent (what one would expect from a Nickels restaurant) and the service was amazingly good and friendly. We got there just a few minutes before the closing hour, they let us in and gave us time to order. Then gave us time to eat and really were super nice."}
{"text":"Un petit diner american au millieu de la plaza st-hubert.
Les serveurs sont tres agréable et attentionné, les prixs tournent autours de 10 -20$, et la pluplart des plats sont trés durs à finir :p
Une bonne petite adresse bien sympathique !"}
{"text":"Le service laisse à désirer alors que le restaurant était quasiment vide ! Il faudrait leur apprendre ce qu'est un uf à la coque car servi comme un uf dur. Plats sans grand intérêt culinaire. Prix cependant raisonnable."}
{"text":"Apparently all the Portuguese places open late on Mondays or are closed. Came to Nickel's cuz I couldn't waste anymore time for lunch . The thing about Nickels they are always blow average or average food wise . If you not in the mood for McDonald's or a&w type of food then there fine. the soup of the day was surprisingly good chicken cream of something. Took the fish and chips not that good. Didn't taste fresh at all but what did I honestly expect ¿ I tried a few Nickels now I'm always disappointed in the food service was good I like old school  look . Unfortunately for me I don't think I'll ever eat at a Nickels any more way better places out there ."}
